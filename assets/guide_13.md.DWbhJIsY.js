It revolves around the slogan \\"R U OK?\\" (are you okay?), and advocates for people to have conversations with others. The organisation has a dedicated R U OK? Day, held annually on the second Thursday of September, which encourages Australians to connect with people who have emotional insecurity, to address social isolation and promote community cohesiveness. R U OK? works collaboratively with experts in suicide prevention and mental illness, as well as government departments, corporate leaders, teachers, universities, students and community groups. Its activities also align with the Australian Government's LIFE Framework. Background In a 12-month period, it is estimated that 65,000 Australians make a suicide attempt, with an average of 2,320 people dying by suicide every year. The 2007 National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing of adults estimated that around 45 per cent of the Australian population in the 16-85 age bracket will experience mental illness in their lifetime, while 20 per cent of the population experience a common mental disorder in the previous 12 months.  History  Tree painted with the R U OK? slogan Gavin Larkin's father, Barry Larkin, died by suicide in 1996. Later, when Gavin Larkin experienced depression and was concerned about his mental health, he completed a course at Landmark Worldwide. From this course, he chose to complete a project about suicide prevention to honour his father, to create a national day of action about contacting people who might be having a difficult time. This resulted in the eventual co-creation with Janina Nearn of R U OK? in 2009. The R U OK? slogan was established from extensive research proving that communication with people positively impacts their mental state. The message for the first R U OK?Day was \\"a conversation can change a life\\". On the R U OK? website Larkin has said that, \\"[G]etting connected and staying connected is the best thing anyone can do for themselves and for those who may be at risk.\\" Since its inception, many Australian celebrities, community leaders and athletes such as Hugh Jackman; Naomi Watts; Simon Baker; South Sydney Rabbitohs co-captain, Roy Asotasi; former professional rugby league footballer Wendell Sailor, gold medal Olympian Libby Trickett and community leader Deepak Vinayak have enlisted as ambassadors and supporters in order to raise awareness. In 2009 Yahoo!7's Sunrise reported that 650,000 conversations took place as a result of the campaign. Founder Gavin Larkin died from lymphoma in 2011, but his family have continued to promote the campaign. In 2012, the annual Don Ritchie Suicide Prevention Award was announced in conjunction with R U OK? Day to recognise the \\"extraordinary acts of service and commitment to suicide prevention,\\" said NSW Minister for Mental Health, Kevin Humphries. After his death, Don Ritchie, the 'Angel of the Gap', was recognised for his \\"efforts in saving the lives of hundreds of people at risk of suicide\\" with the award continuing to recognise the efforts of others in this field. The 2013 organisational category of the award was won by R U OK?. A study on the effectiveness of the 2014 R U OK?Day campaign found that the broader population were aware of the day and that it had a positive impact. In 2017, R U OK?Day was featured on Australian Story. After complaints about the 2019 R U OK? signage in Woolgoolga, the Chamber of Commerce decided to remove large letters spelling out the slogan, which had been installed along public roads. The complaints stated that it inaccurately portrayed the town as being \\"...full of people with a mental illness...\\", disregarding the message of the campaign. The vice president of the Woolgoolga Chamber of Commerce, R U OK ambassador Lisa Nichols, was hurt by the complaints given the nature of the day. The Woolgoolga community and Nichols had received that year's Barbara Hocking Memorial Award: Community category for their R U OK \\"Woopi Wears Yellow\\" promotions. R U OK? has collaborated with transport companies to host a separately-timed industry-specific Rail R U OK? Day in April each year. Train drivers and other rail workers are provided with trauma support options including the RailRes app. R U OK?Day has been subject to criticism that while it is well-meaning, it has a superficial and simplistic focus of informal health promotion through encouraging professional referrals. Referrals are also suggested without acknowledgement of service wait times, service costs and the complexities of managing mental health. The day has also been reviewed as being promoted in a tokenistic way, despite the organisation's recommended guidelines of suggesting ongoing support to others. There are possible harmful impacts from people starting conversations for which they are ill-equipped or uninformed, with triggering language. There has also been a call for increased insight, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring to acknowledge mental health's slow onset and cyclical nature, rather than an annual day. R U OK?'s own reporting into their impact and media sentiment analysis has been criticised for its low sample size and partial capture of experiences around the day. R U OK? Limited is on the Register of Harm Prevention Charities. The organisation has corporate sponsors, ambassadors and government funding. The Department of Health granted R U OK? funds of $824,945 for suicide prevention campaigns and web resources (effective July 2019 to June 2021).

It was described in 1991 from subfossil material collected in 1976 by Storrs Olson from the calcareous Makawehi dunes on the south-eastern coast of the island of Kauai. Its remains have also been found at the nearby Makauwahi Cave site. Etymology The generic name Chelychelynechen comes from the Greek chelys (“turtle”), chelyne (“lip” or “jaw”), with chen (“goose”), referring to the distinctly turtle-like appearance and structure of the beak. The specific epithet is from the Latin quassus (“broken” or “shattered”), alluding to the fragmentary condition of the type material. Description Apart from the head, the bird was similar to other moa-nalo species, with robust legs and reduced, non-functional wings. The main distinguishing feature was the remarkable beak which had a rostrum almost as high as it was long, with a broad palatal surface, and with nostrils oriented almost vertically rather than horizontally. The structure of this feeding apparatus appears convergent on that of tortoises and indicates adaptation to a diet of plants.

Artist Raab comes from a family involved in creative enterprises. His mother was a landscape artist and an acquaintance of Frederick Varley (1881-1969) from Canada's Group of Seven. Raab's uncle, Ernest Raab was a sculptor of Jewish art and created bronze sculptures and glass altars for synagogues and memorial sites, such as the Holocaust Memorial in Earl Bales Park Toronto, Canada.

Freedom Party of Ontario. Retrieved 15 July 2013. As a scientist and engineer, Raab claims to bring his technical training in materials to bear on his art: \\"My art is the result of my many years working in science and physics, encompassing a career focused on 3D measurement devices. [...] Parleau is about realizations. I realize that when I try to control, I control less. I realize that every time I try to color inside the lines that the color leaks out. I realize that understanding begins by admitting I don't understand. In physics, the uncertainty principle embodies the resistance to precision. The art begins formalized, boundary- delimited and planar, and then begins to quickly escape and deform and seek other dimensions.\\" Parleau Raab works in a new medium, he calls and patented as \\"Parleau\\" (\\"Parleaux\\" in the plural) which is French for 'through the water'. The term suggests the quality of light passing through liquid. He uses large-format sheets of metal (aluminum or stainless steel) which he paints first and then forms and sculpts by hand.

The building is on Nikola Pašić Square in downtown Belgrade, and is a landmark and tourist attraction. Between its completion in 1936 and 2006, it was the seat of the Parliament of Yugoslavia and the Parliament of Serbia and Montenegro. History Girl With a Pitcher fountain The Great Debating chamber The Small Debating chamber King Peter I built the House of Representatives of the Kingdom of Serbia near the former location of a large Batal mosque. The first plans for the future House of Representatives were drawn up by architect Konstantin Jovanović in 1891. His plans were slightly revised because of a new state constitution mandating a bicameral (instead of unicameral) legislature. Architect Jovan Ilkić won a 1901 design competition, adhering to Jovanović's basic plan. The cornerstone of the House of Representative was laid in a public 1907 ceremony by King Peter I in the presence of other members of the royal family and senior officials. Construction lasted until 1936, interrupted by the Balkan Wars, World War I, and the Great Depression. The first session in the new house took place on 20 October 1936. The building is designed in neo-baroque style. Its interior, completed in 1938, was designed by Russian architect Nikolai Krasnov. Krasnov designed every detail: chandeliers, lamps, handles, windows, and furniture. His plans were painted in watercolor, rather than a classical technical drawing with pencil and ruler. Lawmakers did not have long to enjoy the newly built House of Representatives. After the 1941 invasion of Yugoslavia and during World War II, the House of Representatives housed the German high command for southeastern Europe. The building was damaged during the demonstrations on 5 October 2000, and appears on the RSD5,000 banknote. The parliament building was featured in the 2011 film, Coriolanus.Ralph Fiennes filming \\"Coriolanus\\" in Serbia =Exterior= Main entrance The house was originally designed by architect Konstantin Jovanović in 1891, but financial constraints prevented its construction at the time. A new design was proposed by Jovan Ilkić in 1901 after a constitutional amendment and the creation of a bicameral parliament. Following the formation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1918, the parliament was increased and the original design (under construction) deemed inadequate. A modified design was made by Ilkić's son, Pavle, in 1920 and construction resumed until its completion in 1936. A sculpture by Toma Rosandić, Igrali se konji vrani (Play by Black Horses), was installed in front of the building in 1939. =Interior= Play by Black Horses, 1938 sculpture by Toma Rosandić Great Hall inside building The building's interior was designed by architect Nikolai Krasnov in academic traditional style. Covering about , it has four storeys: a basement, ground floor, first floor, and attic, with mezzanines below the basement, between the basement and the ground floor and between the ground and first floors. The building has 100 offices, large and small halls, and four committee rooms. The library, on the first floor, contains over 60,000 books. The building is decorated with 23 frescoes and a number of paintings, sculptures, and other fine artwork. During the 5 October riots in 2000, 91 pieces of art were stolen from the National Assembly. Thirty-five have been found, but 56 remain missing. The building itself was also damaged.  Construction  Construction began on 27 August 1907, when the building's cornerstone was laid in the presence of Peter I of Serbia, George, Crown Prince of Serbia, members of parliament and the diplomatic corps. Its charter, sealed in the cornerstone during the ceremony, bore the names of the king, the metropolitan, and chief architect Jovan Ilkić. Construction was overseen by Belgrade contractor Vasa Tešić. It was delayed until the end of World War I, with only the first floor completed. Construction was influenced by the formation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, which required the project to be modified. After Ilkić's death in 1917 his son, Ministry of Construction architect Pavle Ilkić, led the project. His duties included making the required changes and completing the original design. Construction continued from 1920 to 1926, when it was again suspended. A decision about the next phase was made after the death of Alexander I of Yugoslavia in 1934, when the contractor became Ministry of Construction chief architect Nikolaj Krasnov (1864–1939).А.

Г. Богуновић, Архитектонска енциклопедија Београда XIX и XX века, архитекти, том II, Београд 2005. Krasnov's thirty years of experience in public-building design (giving him the titles of Architect of the Russian Imperial Court and \\"the academician of architecture\\") led to his invitation to work on important buildings in the Serbian capital, and he provided details of the interior. The National Assembly was dedicated on 18 October 1936 in the presence of Peter II of Yugoslavia, after 29 years of construction. The first governmental session was held two days later, and by the end of the year the building was fully completed.  Architecture  medallions (from left: Demosthenes, Cicero, Pallas Athena, and Pericles) by Đorđe Jovanović The Serbian Honor Guard in the front of the National Assembly building The building's central risalit is dominated by a portico with a triangular tympanum, above which is a dome with a lantern at the top. Its external design (with rustic green stone from Ripanj for the basement), and the shape of windows and pilasters extending through the two central levels and ending in a roof cornice with balustrade, indicate neo-Renaissance and neo-Baroque models. The original design's heraldic and sculptural decorations were not executed. The only plastic ornaments are medallions with images of Pericles, Athena, Demosthenes and Cicero, by sculptor Đorđe Jovanović, on the lateral risalits. A sculpture above the portals of an angel with a torch and an olive branch was designed by sculptor Petar Palavičini. A 1937 fence with decorative candelabras and two guardrooms with stylized lanterns on top was designed by Krasnov; the fence stood until 1956, when it was removed for Marx and Engels Square (now Nikola Pašić Square). In 1939 a sculptural group by Toma Rosandić, Black Horses Playing, was installed near the steps. Interior design includes large and small halls and conference rooms, a central vestibule topped by a dome, polychrome walls with columns, pilasters, niches and loggias and a marble floor. The Assembly Hall, designed to hold 200 people, was expanded to accommodate 400. Krasnov's furniture designs reflect contemporary Belgrade tastes. The walls of the Assembly are adorned with twenty frescoes, made during 1937 by prominent Yugoslav artists. Because of its architectural, cultural, historical and artistic value, the National Assembly Building was declared a cultural monument in 1984. Former building Before 2006, the National Assembly of Serbia met in another parliament building on Kralja Milana Street while its current building was used by the Federal Assembly of Yugoslavia. The parliament building is still used by the national assembly for offices and administration. The design for this building was completed in 1948, and its construction was completed in late 1953.

The NetBSD drivers can be used on top of the rump kernel on a wide range of POSIX operating systems, such as the Hurd, Linux, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, Solaris and even Cygwin, along with the file system utilitiesfile system utilities built with the rump libraries. The rump kernels can also run without POSIX directly on top of the Xen hypervisor, an L4 microkernel using the Genode OS Framework or even on \\"OS-less\\" bare metal.  Anykernel  An anykernel is different in concept from microkernels, exokernels, partitioned kernels or hybrid kernels in that it tries to preserve the advantages of a monolithic kernel, while still enabling the faster driver development and added security in user space. The \\"anykernel\\" concept refers to an architecture-agnostic approach to drivers where drivers can either be compiled into the monolithic kernel or be run as a userspace process, microkernel-style, without code changes. With drivers, a wider concept is considered where not only device drivers are included but also file systems and the networking stack. File System Access Utilities The File System Access Utilities (fs-utils) is a subproject built with the rump libraries. It aims to have a set of utilities to access and modify a file system image without having to mount it. The fs-utils does not require superuser account to access the image or device. The advantage of fs-utils over similar projects such as mtools is supporting the usage of familiar filesystem Unix commands (\`ls\`, \`cp\`, \`mv\`, \`cd\`, etc.) for a large number of file systems which are supported by NetBSD.

Early life and background Elham began swimming at the age of five and started to teach swimming at the age of 17. As a child Asghari’s childhood dream was to swim in open waters and to achieve her goal she looked for training programmes on the internet. Asghari’s father worked as a wrestler, and encouraged her to register her records. In Iran Islamic Sharia law is applied. The Islamic dress code imposes that women are required to cover their hair and body regardless of their religion and nationality. Moreover, female athletes in Iran are expected to practice separately from men; for swimmers this means swimming in women-only pools or in their own times. The only competition in which Iranian women swimmers take part are the Women's Islamic Games, as they cannot go to competitions abroad so they would not be seen by men while wearing swimsuits. To comply to the Sharia, Asghari came up with a special Hijab swimsuit that covered her body from head to toe, which in water adds 6 kilograms to the swimmer's weight. Career In 2008, the Iranian ministry of sports recognized Asghari's 12-kilometer swim for her usage of the full-body swimming outfit. = 2010: Accident = Asghari's problems with her performances began in 2010, when she decided to swim around Kish Island in three days, overseen by a representative from the ministry of sports. When Asghari had only swum 5 kilometres, police boats rammed into her and people around. She injured a leg and had her hip was lacerated by boat propellers. The trauma made Asghari decide to stop swimming. However her family and friends encouraged her to return. After undergoing therapy, Asghari began to practice again, swimming 5 kilometres every night and running 12 kilometres daily. = 2013 = On June 11, 2013, Asghari swam 20 kilometres going back and forth for 8 hours from 5:30 am to 2:30 pm in the Caspian Sea near Nowshahr. The area was a private, women-only beach to avoid any potential run-ins with police boats. The representative from Iran’s sports ministry tried to knock her distance down to 15 kilometres, after Asghari protested they accepted 18 kilometres, only to afterward refusing to approve her record saying that the feminine features of her body were visible when she came out of water. One of the representative of the federation said: \\"The deputy sports minister told him that her costume wasn’t suitable for free water swimming.\\" One of Asghari's friends declared that the swimsuit was the same of the 2008 record. Shahrnaz Vernoos, adviser for women’s affairs in the federation, said on a family website: \\"There was no representative [of the federation] and it is unclear if she really swam 18 kilometres, female free swimming is contrary to the rules of the ministry of sports and youth, for three years there has been no competition.\\" Reza Habibi, a member of the federation's technical committee, said: \\"There are no records recognised in free water swimming, what she has done is a personal act without coordinating with the federation and the ministry.\\" He also added that the international federation only acknowledges swims of \\"5, 10, 15 and 25 kilometres.\\"  Support  Asghari posted a video or herself online with the help of her manager, Farvartish Rezvaniyeh, who decided to help her to publish her plight. When Rezvaniyeh heard about Asghari’s case on Facebook he contacted her and made her make the video. Asghari gained the support of thousands of fans on Facebook and tributes poured as more people became aware of the case. In her video Asghari promises that women will not have to wear such dampening swimsuits.

The documentary argues that the violent social collapse within the Pruitt-Igoe complex was not due to the demographic composition of its residents, but was a result of wider, external social forces, namely the declining economic fortunes of St. Louis, the resulting impact upon employment opportunities, and the project's failure to meet occupancy projections from the start and therefore to meet monthly income projected to cover maintenance costs. Furnaces made to incinerate garbage failed, pipes/plumbing failed, and more issues kept on to the point residents stopped paying rent.  Plot  The film begins with a former resident of the Pruitt–Igoe public housing complex returning to the site of the buildings in the north side of St. Louis, and noting that in spite of the decades since the planned demolition of the buildings, the site remains largely vacant. It continues by detailing the decision by the city to replace 19th century tenement housing with high-rise public housing, ultimately designed by Minoru Yamasaki (later the famed designer of the World Trade Center) in the modernist style as thirty-three 11-floor buildings. Interviews with former residents, archival images, and film are used to tell first impressions about moving into Pruitt-Igoe and the steady deterioration of living conditions during the 1960s and early 1970s before the destruction by planned implosion between 1972 and 1976. The film takes issue with the various explanations for the failure of the Pruitt-Igoe complex that have developed since its demolition, including that it was the fault of the modernist theory of architecture itself (an explanation developed by architectural historian Charles Jencks ) or of the general concept of public housing. Instead, the explanation offered is that the fate of the Pruitt-Igoe project was determined by the declining population and industrial base in St. Louis after World War II. The documentary argues that this process left few jobs for the remaining residents, thus reducing funds available for maintenance and security of the buildings, which were planned to be paid for by tenant rents even as residents grew poorer and the living conditions in the project deteriorated. Reception The Pruitt-Igoe Myth has a rating of 89% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 19 reviews, and a rating of 70 (out of 100) on Metacritic based on 8 reviews. It was nominated for a Satellite Award in 2012 in the category of Best Documentary Film.

His acknowledgement of his Jewish heritage, which he made in 1942 during one of his periods of captivity by the Gestapo, has been frequently proclaimed and used as an example of Jewish resistance to the National Socialist regime.Compare, for example: Arno Lustiger Zum Kampf auf Leben und Tod. Das Buch vom Widerstand der Juden 1933–1945. Kiepenheuer & Witsch, Köln 1994, S. 74\\\\. (Citation: „Der nun folgende Teil des unbesungenen Helden Georg Hornstein ist das in dieser Form und unter diesen mörderischen Umständen einmalig formulierte Bekenntnis eines Widerstandskämpfers, der seine Bereitschaft bekundet, jederzeit für seine Rechte und seine Würde als Mensch und Jude zu kämpfen.“ [in the context of the unsung heroes, that of George Hornstein's is, under these murderous circumstances a unique formulated confession of a resistance fighter who expresses his readiness at any time to fight for his rights and his dignity as a human being and a Jew]) Life Georg Hornstein was born in Berlin, the son of a shopkeeper and grew up in Düsseldorf, where his family moved in 1902. In Düsseldorf his parents operated a shop on the elegant Königsallee. Hornstein completed his Abitur and was enrolled briefly at the business school in Cologne, until he enlisted as a volunteer near the end of World War I in January 1918. He was first sent to Vienna and then served as an ensign in Krakow until his discharge in November 1918. He then continued his studies in Cologne, Paris, London and Buenos Aires and returned to Düsseldorf in 1926. After the National Socialists seized power, Hornstein emigrated to Amsterdam and opened a leathergoods business. At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he volunteered for the Spanish Army in Barcelona, belonging to the German Thälmann Battalion of the International Brigades.https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/spanjews.pdf During the battle or siege of Madrid he was seriously wounded, nevertheless from September 1937 until April 1938 he served as communications officer in Albacete. Then he returned to his business in Amsterdam. In May 1940, during World War II, as the National Socialists occupied the Netherlands, he was still able to liquidate his business and with the proceeds from the sale of his business to acquire jewelry and other valuables. However, he was not able to leave the Netherlands and flee abroad. Hornstein was captured by the security police ( Sicherheitsdienst or SD) and transferred to the prison in Düsseldorf, where he was first detained and then also tortured. During one of his periods of imprisonment by the Gestapo, Hornstein wrote the following declaration about his Jewish identity: I possess German citizenship and according to the letter of the law I am considered a German citizen. However, as a Jew, I have, for all practical purposes, lost all rights in Germany, and was therefore forced to seek a new homeland … […] … As a Jew, I fought [in Spain] for my convictions and my rights. Under the present circumstances I no longer consider myself a German citizen and would use every opportunity that I might be given, to become a citizen of another country, where, as a Jew, I would be prepared, at any time, to fight for my rights. I have no further comments to make. Georg Hornstein, Interrogation report from the Gestapo, January 24, 1942.Citation from the SS interrogation of January 24, 1942, in Düsseldorf. Abstracted in Arno Lustiger: Zum Kampf auf Leben und Tod. Das Buch vom Widerstand der Juden 1933–1945. Köln 1994, S. 74. Based on the interrogation report and evaluations of those in power, on March 6, 1942, Hornstein was taken into protective custody at level three (as “especially dangerous”) and transferred to the Buchenwald concentration camp, where he arrived on May 7, 1942. There he was under constant surveillance and was not allowed to work. In the meantime, his mother, Hulda Hornstein, was deported from Düsseldorf to Theresienstadt on July 21, 1942. Georg Hornstein was murdered by members of the SS in Buchenwald on September 3, 1942.

The geology of Lancashire in northwest England consists in the main of Carboniferous age rocks but with Triassic sandstones and mudstones at or near the surface of the lowlands bordering the Irish Sea though these are largely obscured by Quaternary deposits. Silurian A small fault-bounded area of rocks of Wenlock age lies to the north of Ireby in the extreme north of the county. Carboniferous Rocks originating in the Carboniferous Period underlie the uplands of eastern and north Lancashire. Listed in order of succession i.e. lowermost/oldest first, they comprise the various limestones, mudstones, siltstones and sandstones of the Bowland High Group and Trawden Limestone Group, Craven Group, Millstone Grit Group, Pennine Coal Measures Group and Warwickshire Group. =Stratigraphy= The Bowland High Group is bundled together with the Trawden Limestone Group in the Carboniferous Limestone Supergroup. Together they include sedimentary sequences developed during the Tournaisian on isolated structural highs or horsts, namely the Bowland High and the Central Lancashire High. The Bowland High Group comprises the older Chatburn Limestone Formation and the younger Clitheroe Limestone Formation. These are largely limestone sequences but with subordinate mudstones and siltstones. The Trawden Limestone Group is not known at the surface but is proved in numerous boreholes. It is not divided into formations.Waters, C.N., Waters, R.A. Barclay, W.J. and Davies, J.R. 2009 A lithostratigraphical framework for the Carboniferous successions of southern Great Britain (onshore) British Geological Survey Research Report, RR/09/01 pp24-28 The overlying Craven Group comprises, again in stratigraphic order, the Hodder Mudstone, Hodderense Limestone, Pendleside Limestone and Bowland Shale Formations. These are of Visean and earliest Namurian age. Older texts refer instead to a Worston Shale Group comprising the first three of the above formations (and including the Clitheroe Limestone Formation), and an overlying Bowland Shale Group comprising a Lower and an Upper Bowland Shale. The Millstone Grit Group comprises the Pendleton, Silsden, Samlesbury, Hebden, Marsden and Rossendale formations. This succession of sandstones and mudstones was deposited during Namurian times. The sandstones of the Rossendale Formation have been widely quarried for building purposes; Rossendale Flags are found as paving widely across the region. Older texts subdivide the Millstone Grit in different ways. The sandstones, mudstones and coals of the Pennine Coal Measures Group form the Lancashire Coalfield which includes both the Burnley Coalfield and the South Lancashire Coalfield. Both were economically important to Lancashire's economy during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The Group is divided into Lower, Middle and Upper formations, all dating from the Westphalian. These are in turn overlain by the Etruria and Halesowen formations of the Warwickshire Group.Waters, C.N., Waters, R.A. Barclay, W.J. and Davies, J.R. 2009 A lithostratigraphical framework for the Carboniferous successions of southern Great Britain (onshore) British Geological Survey Research Report, RR/09/01 pp14 =Landscape features= Longridge Fell is formed in the Pendle Grit. Strata dip locally to the south and south-east presenting a prominent northwest-facing scarp. Pendle Hill is similarly formed from these erosion- resistant sandstones. The southern part of the Forest of Bowland, including the prominent Parlick together with the isolated Beacon Fell are also formed from the Pendle Grit. The Ward's Stone Sandstone Formation forms the western parts of these fells whilst to the north-east it is the Dure Clough Sandstone which forms the plateau surface. The Arnside and Silverdale AONB, the southern half of which is within Lancashire is formed by a succession of limestones assigned to the Great Scar Limestone Group. Warton Crag and Jack Scout, a National Trust property, are prominent features in the locality where the limestone is well exposed. Leck Fell is an area of limestone moorland west of the hill of Gragareth, the county's highest point, close to the border with both North Yorkshire and Cumbria. A succession of limestones assigned to the Great Scar Limestone Group and Yoredale Group are host to numerous cave systems. The summit area is formed in rocks of the Alston and Pendleton formations. Billinge Hill near Blackburn is formed by the Revidge Grit whilst the nearby Hoghton Tower stands on a lower hill formed by the same Namurian age rock, one of a series of sandstones within the Millstone Grit. Anglezarke Moor and Withnell Moor are formed by the Fletcher Bank, Helmshore and Brooksbottoms grits.BGS 1:50,000 geological map sheet 75 Preston The fells to the south of Slaidburn, including Easington, Waddington and Birkett fells are formed from the Warley Wise Grit. It was formerly quarried beside the B6478 road in this vicinity.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 geological map sheet 68 Clitheroe Permian A small area of rocks originating in the Permian Period occurs near Lancaster, Morecambe and Glasson Dock though it is entirely obscured by recent deposits and is known only from borehole cores. These are the Collyhurst Sandstone of the Appleby Group and the sandstones, mudstones and evaporites of the overlying Cumbrian Coast Group. There are also narrow bands of these rocks (Manchester Marls and Collyhurst Sandstone) to the north and south of Preston though again they are generally buried beneath glacial till. Another small outlier of early/lower Permian rocks is centred on the village of Ireby and extends across the county boundary into North Yorkshire. Triassic Lancashire's coastal plain is underlain by sedimentary rocks laid down during the Triassic Period comprising sandstones, siltstones and mudstones though outcrops are restricted to those areas which are not covered by thick superficial deposits. Within the Kirkham basin, the following Triassic sequence is known from boreholes: *Mercia Mudstone Group (subdivided thus:) Breckells Mudstones Kirkham Mudstones Singeton Mudstones Hambleton Mudstones *Sherwood Sandstone Group The lowermost part of the Sherwood Sandstone Group is of Permian age. The two groups as currently defined replace earlier terminology which referred to the Bunter Sandstone, Keuper Sandstone and Keuper Marl.British Geological Survey 1975, 1:50,000 geological map series of England and Wales, sheet 75 Preston (solid edition) A small outlier of Sherwood Sandstone Group rocks occurs at the surface at Skelmersdale. The Preesall Salt occurs within the Kirkham Mudstones in a syncline beneath Preesall and the River Wyre. At least 185m thickness of halite with some mudstone is known to exist. There is also some salt present in the overlying Breckells Mudstones.British Geological Survey 1975, 1:50,000 geological map series of England and Wales, sheet 66 Blackpool (solid & drift edition); & sheet 75 Preston (solid edition) Palaeogene Caton Dyke, a dyke of olivine alkali basalt intrudes Carboniferous strata east of Caton. Its alignment is roughly similar to that of numerous faults in the area and is seen to vary in width from over 5m to just 60 cm across its three known exposures. It is considered that it may form a part of the dyke swarm associated with the Isle of Mull off the west coast of Scotland. It is thought to be continuous with Grindleton Dyke in the Clitheroe area.BGS 1:50,000 geological map and memoir for sheet 59 Lancaster, p108-111 Geological structure Much of the county occupies the Craven Basin, a depositional basin active during the Carboniferous period. It is bounded to the north by the Lake District block and to the southeast by the Central Lancashire High. To the northeast the Craven Fault System marks the edge of the Askrigg Block. Within the basin a couple of sub-basins are recognised; the Lancaster Fells sub-basin and Bowland sub-basin (or 'Bowland Trough'), separated by the 'Bowland High' and 'South Fells Tilt Block'. Rocks in the area, especially within the latter sub-basin were folded during the Variscan Orogeny to form the Ribblesdale Fold Belt which is aligned broadly southwest - northeast. Further south is the Rossendale Basin.BGS 1:50,000 geological map memoir for sheet 59 Lancaster, p130-140 In the west of the county, the West Lancashire basin is in effect a landward extension of the East Irish Sea Basin. The area is threaded by numerous broadly north-south aligned normal faults thought to have been active during Permo-Triassic times and perhaps later, in association with early rifting of the Atlantic Ocean.BGS 1:50,000 geological map memoir for sheet 59 Lancaster, p143-144 Quaternary =Glacial legacy= The larger part of lowland Lancashire i.e. the West Lancashire Coastal Plain, The Fylde and adjoining areas is covered by a thick mantle of glacial till. These deposits are the legacy of the over-riding of the area on several occasions by glacial ice during the past 2 million years. The present distribution of deposits and the landforms to which they give rise are largely the result of the last ice age, the Devensian which peaked around 22-20,000 years ago. Drumlins caused by the moulding of sub-glacial sediments are a significant feature of the landscape in the north of the county. =Alluvium= Ribble estuarine alluvium Significant areas of marine and estuarine alluvium, typically silt and clay, extend around Ribble estuary north from Southport and also around the southern shores of Morecambe Bay from Cleveleys and Fleetwood east through Preesall then north via Glasson to Morecambe. Narrower bands of these deposits fringe the coast between Hest Bank and Carnforth. River alluvium is characteristic of the floodplains of the River Wyre and its major tributary, the River Brock.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 scale geological map series sheets (England Wales) 59-60, 66-68, 74-76 and accompanying memoirs =Blown sand= Extensive areas of blown sand have been mapped along the coastal zone south from Blackpool through Lytham St Annes. Narrower belts of these deposits also characterise the north coast of Fylde at Fleetwood and Preesall and a rather smaller area west of Sunderland Point. Considerable areas in the south of the county around Ormskirk are characterised by blown sand, referred to here as the Shirdley Hill Sand. After the ice sheets had melted away from the Irish Sea but before vegetation had taken hold and before the sea re-flooded that basin, blowing sand drifted across the area to form a sheetlike deposit up to 2.5m thick in places.Howard et al 2007 geology of the Liverpool District - a brief explanation of the geological map Sheet explanation of the British Geological Survey 1:50,000 sheet 96 Liverpool (England and Wales), pp21-22 =Peat= Peat deposits are common in the county and can be divided into areas of 'lowland moss' and 'hill peat'. Large swathes of the Forest of Bowland are covered in peat and there are smaller patches elsewhere as at Pendle Hill. Lowland examples include Stalmine Moss, Rawcliffe Moss, Winmarleigh and Cockerham mosses west of Garstang. There is also a large area east of Southport where extensive raised bogs have been drained. Many have been thoroughly exploited.Johnson, R. H. (ed) 1985 The geomorphology of North- west England Manchester University Press ch16 pp299-312 =Karst and cave development= There has been development of cave systems in parts of the county where limestone is present. Of particular note is the Three Counties System which, besides Lancashire, underlies neighbouring parts of North Yorkshire and Cumbria. At over 86 km in length it is the most extensive cave network known in Britain and ranks 27th longest in the world. Various individually named caves beneath Leck Fell link underground to form the wider system. These include Ease Gill Caverns, Lost John's Cave and Ireby Fell Cavern. =Landslides= Numerous examples of landslides occur around the east of the county. A study in the Forest of Rossendale by the British Geological Survey revealed three main types of occurrence, namely those associated with: *the over-deepening of valleys by glaciers and glacial meltwater *drift-filled valleys *faulting They range from rotational ones, often multiple in nature to simple topples and rock falls. The Cliviger valley is particularly affected by landslips which have occurred in the post-glacial period.

This was done to support multiple sclerosis research. Background The late British DJ and personality Steve Walsh was influenced by Band Aid's \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\" and USA for Africa's \\"We Are the World\\", for those hits became a very fashionable vehicle of raising money and awareness. Walsh made talks with Steve MacIntosh of the Cool Notes about creating a charity supergroup to make a similar charity record for the UK, as well as to support multiple sclerosis research. MacIntosh volunteered to write the song. Walsh recruited Paul Hardcastle to produce the song with him. A few weeks later, MacIntosh had sent a demo of the song to Walsh and Hardcastle, who appreciated the track, and \\"Give Give Give\\" became the song to lead the project. Phil Fearon, MacIntosh's the Cool Notes, Mel & Kim and Hazell Dean were some of the British dance and soul acts involved, alongside comedian Lenny Henry. American acts such as Jean Carne, Odyssey, Steve Mancha, Kenny G and Edwin Starr also took part. The first version was released in the autumn of 1986 under the name Disco Aid, and managed to chart at No. 85 on the UK Singles Chart. In 1987, the project was re-recorded and re-produced together with British producers Stock Aitken Waterman. This time it was released under the act name Dance Aid.

This leads to a limited number of \\"the usual suspects\\" who will say expected ideas that will not require extensive explanation such as mainstream political ones. The beauty of concision, you know, saying a couple sentences between two commercials, the beauty of that is you can only repeat conventional thoughts. Suppose I go on Nightline, whatever it is, two minutes, and I say Gaddafi is a terrorist, Khomeini is a murderer etcetera etcetera...I don't need any evidence, everyone just nods. On the other hand, suppose you're saying something that isn't just regurgitating conventional pieties, suppose you say something that's the least bit unexpected or controversial, people will quite reasonably expect to know what you mean. If you said that you'd better have a reason, better have some evidence. You can't give evidence if you're stuck with concision. That's the genius of this structural constraint. Greenwald on Chomsky and Staying In the Mainstream Without Compromise Furthermore, introducing controversial or unexpected statements that do not conform to those conventional ideas are discouraged as time inefficient because the person will be required to explain and support them in detail. Since this can often take considerable time in itself and digress from the primary discussion topic of the broadcast, this is discouraged. Alternatively, the explanation could be subject to extensive editing for time which could lead to an inadequate presentation of the subject's thoughts. Illustration This media control idea is illustrated in the film documentary, Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media, where journalist Jeff Greenfield explains why a person like Chomsky may be excluded from being interviewed on air because he takes too long to warm up. The film then follows up with Chomsky himself explaining the concept while the film gives examples of controversial statements he has made in the past that would require extensive explanation in an interview. The 1999 feature film The Insider has a dramatization of the media concept where journalist Mike Wallace goes public on a news show about the censoring of a controversial story on 60 Minutes. When Wallace sees his interview broadcast, he is furious that his testimony is limited to a curt statement that does not adequately explain his position and the only excuse from the producers he receives is that it had to be cut for time.

He was a legislator of Punjab State Legislative Assembly, representing the Communist Party of India for four terms and a Minister of Food and Civil Supplies in the United Front ministry led by Justice Gurnam Singh. He was also involved in trade union movement in India, aligning with the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC). The Government of India awarded him the third highest civilian honour of the Padma Bhushan, in 1998, for his contributions to society.  Biography  Satyapal Dang was born on 4 October 1920 in Gujranwala of the erstwhile Punjab Province, British India and did his early schooling in Lahore. Getting involved in the Indian freedom movement during his student days, he worked with the leftist wing of the Indian National Congress in the beginning but moved the Communist Party of India and became an active worker in the Bombay Commune of the party in the 1940s. Later, he became the general secretary of the All India Students Federation at the age of 25, and participated in the 1st Party Congress hed in Mumbai in 1943. It was during this time, he had the opportunity to work alongside Vimla Bakaya, an associate from his student days who would later marry him in 1952. After the Indian independence and in the aftermath of Calcutta Thesis and resultant insurgencies, the party was banned and when the ban was lifted, Dang couple were entrusted with the responsibility of working amidst the working class in Amritsar region. The couple relocated to Chheharta Sahib, a village near Amritsar and in 1953, when the first local election was held, Dang became the president of Chheharta Municipality. Dang was involved with the local politics of Chheharta Sahib for the next decade and a half, heading the municipality several times and working to develop the place into a model town. The shift in focus came in 1967 when he was asked by the Party to participate in the state elections and he successfully contested from Amritsar West constituency against Giani Gurmukh Singh Musafir, the then Chief Minister of Punjab. The United Front which included the Communist Party of India won majority in the elections and Dang joined the coalition ministry led by Justice Gurnam Singh as the Minister of Food and Civil Supplies. It is reported that he declined to use the ministerial bungalow and chose to stay in the MLA hostel during his tenure as the minister. He retained the seat in the next three legislative assembly elections held in 1969, 1972 and 1977 but lost in the 1980 election to Sewa Ram Arora, but his wife would regain the seat in 1982. In the 1980s, during the Khalistan movement, Dang was known to have worked against the secessionism, with his base at Ekta Bhawan, a centre he had built in Chheharta. He also published two books, Terrorism In Punjab, a book detailing his views on the Punjab crisis and State Religion and Politics, an analytical report on religion and politics with reference to the politics of Punjab and Kashmir. The Government of India awarded him the civilian honor of the Padma Bhushan in 1998. Towards the later years of his life, he was afflicted with Alzheimer's disease and retired from active politics after the death of Vimla Dang in 2009. He died on 6 June 2013, at the age 92, at the Amritsar home of his nephew. The Dang couple were issueless, reportedly by their own choice. Once Upon a Time in Chheharta, a feature-length documentary made by Nakul Singh Sawhney documents the life and work of Satyapal and Vimla Dang in Chheharta.

Early life Nell was born Ellen Quinlan in Parsons, Kansas, the twelfth child of an Irish immigrant railroad worker and his wife. She attended Parsons High School, and following graduation, worked as a stenographer in Kansas City where, aged 17, she married a fellow tenant at her boarding-house, Paul J. Donnelly. A local representative for a shoe company, Donnelly supported her by pooling his earnings with hers to fund her studies at Lindenwood College where she was the only married student. While the Donnellys had no children, Mr. Donnelly later adopted Nell's son, David, who was fathered in 1931 by Senator James Reed. Career Five house dresses by Nelly Don, April 1922 Nell had always insisted on looking nicely dressed all the time, even whilst working at home, for which many women wore cheaply made, unflattering 69-cent dresses. The New York Times reported that she said she wanted to \\"make women look pretty when they are washing dishes.\\" Nell's ruffled dresses and aprons in good-quality, hard-wearing fabrics were made for herself and her family, but were admired by her friends and neighbours, who asked if she would make dresses for them too. In 1916 she started working commercially, selling her first designs through a large local department store, the Gregory B. Peck Dry Goods Company in Kansas. The original order of 216 dresses, run up by two seamstresses in the Donnelly's attic on newly purchased industrial sewing machines, rapidly sold out. This was despite the fact that at a dollar each, they were more expensive than the average housedresses. Nelly Don logo, 1921 In 1919, Nell and Paul Donnelly established the Donnelly Garment Company. The company rapidly grew through the 1920s, becoming known for its focus on good fit and durability combined with attractive designs. Each design was prototyped in every size it would be made in to ensure that the fit was correct and that purchasers would not be forced to alter them, with unsuccessful designs either reworked or not produced. As Nell was a size 16, she wanted her designs to look stylish and flattering on women of a wide range of sizes. In 1927, Kansas City voted Nell its most illustrious businesswoman for her success in turning them into a successful center for ready-to-wear production. The company remained successful through the Great Depression. By 1931 sales figure were at the 3.5 million dollar mark, and it had 1,000-plus employees. In 1932, Nell divorced Paul Donnelly and removed him from the company becoming its sole shareholder. Although she remarried the following year, her new husband played no part in her business. Paul Donnelly died a couple of years later in 1934. Nell focused on her employees' welfare, providing life insurance and medical fee support, a pension plan, an on-site cafeteria and medical care, and even funded and supported employees who wished to study evening courses at the local college. In addition to this, there was a scholarship fund for her employees' children. Despite pressure from the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union through the 1930s and 1940s to unionize the Donnelly Garment Company, this was resisted by her employees and the company did not join the ILGWU until 1968. By 1953 the Donnelly Garment Company was the largest manufacturer of women's clothing worldwide, having expanded from housedresses to making a wider range of garments. She retired from the company in 1956, after which it rebranded itself as Nelly Don Inc and went public in 1958. It went bankrupt in 1978. Abduction On December 16, 1931, Nell was abducted along with George Blair, her chauffeur, by three men and held for $75,000 ransom. The men reportedly hijacked her car at gunpoint, driving them to a cottage in Bonner Springs, Kansas, where she and Blair were held captive for 34 hours. The kidnappers mailed a ransom demand to Paul Donnelly which arrived the following morning, and also phoned the house of the Donnellys' lawyer, James E. Taylor, to tell him where Nell's car had been abandoned, which Taylor's wife dismissed as a hoax call. After Paul's receipt of the letter, he contacted the Taylors and it was realized that it was not a prank. Taylor called in his law partner, James A. Reed, who in addition to being a well-known attorney and politician was a neighbor of the Donnellys. Reed immediately came back to Kansas City from a court trial that was being held elsewhere in Missouri, to involve himself in the search for Nell Donnelly. The abduction and search for Nell Donnelly became an immediate media sensation, with Reed's involvement attracting a great deal of media attention. Reed was alleged to have called upon John Lazia, a major figure in the Kansas city organized crime scene, for assistance with tracing Nell. Lazia was said to have informed the chief of police, Lewis Siegfried, that no Kansas City gangster would have thought of kidnapping Nell Donnelly due to her friendship with Reed, her standing in the community, and her politics. It was also reported that, without protest from the police, Lazia sent out known criminals and gangsters on search parties for the missing woman. One news article at the time was titled \\"How Gangsters Solved the Donnelly Kidnapping\\". Nell Donnelly told police that she and Blair had been rescued by a group of armed men who stormed the secluded house in which she was held, and driven to the outskirts of a town. Following a telephone call, the police found the two abductees safe and surrounded by people in a candy shop. The court case led to the acquittal of Paul Scheidt, who admitted to having carried out the kidnapping but claimed to have believed he was abducting an oilman's wealthy wife in order to extort money from her, and that once he realized the truth, he released his captives. The County Prosecutor, James R. Page, later told The Kansas City Star it was \\"the greatest miscarriage of justice since I have been in office. When a man can come in court and admit he is guilty of kidnapping and a jury turns him loose, it appears as if law-abiding people haven't any protection against the criminal element.\\" However, three other kidnappers, Martin Depew, Walter Werner, and Charles Mele, were convicted of the crime, with Depew and Werner imprisoned for life and Mele given a 35-year sentence. Depew and Warner insisted that Scheidt had known all along exactly what he was doing, although Mele protested his innocence and claimed not to know anyone involved in the case, despite having been identified by Nell as one of her abductors. After the Mele trial, Nell and Reed thanked the jurors personally to assure them that they had not been mistaken in their verdict. Nearly two years after the kidnapping, on December 13, 1933, Nell (who had divorced the previous year) unexpectedly married James A. Reed, whose wife Lura had died the previous year. Later life and death Following her retirement, Nell was closely involved in many local organizations. She donated land in Jackson County, Missouri, to the Missouri Department of Conservation in the name of her second husband, which is now known as the James A. Reed Memorial Wildlife Area. She died, aged 102, on September 8, 1991, and was survived by her son and four grandchildren.

He helped promote hard science to the general public and advocated the development of fundamental scientific research in a \\"post-war disenchantment\\".  Biography  = Early years = The son of clerk assistant Jean-Baptiste Rousseau and Marie Renée Lefort, he was the oldest of three brothers. One of his brothers, René, died at the Battle of France and the other, Jean, volunteered as an airborne radio-operator in the Free French Forces before pursuing a career at Air France. Rousseau was drawn to science as a child through reading a popular astronomy collection published by Théophile Moreux. A gifted student in mathematics who received departmental and national bursaries in 1918 and 1920, Rousseau built his first telescope at the age of 13 and published his first scientific paper at 17. With the help of Jean Becquerel, he was appointed Assistant Boarding Master at the Montargis middle school in 1923. Despite his repeated attempts to be transferred to a city with a university in order to prepare his degree, Rousseau lived for several years between Fontainebleau, Blois and Vendôme. After obtaining his first degree in General Mathematics in 1929, he was transferred to Paris at the Lycée Charlemagne and briefly to the Lycée Janson-de-Sailly before becoming assistant teacher at the Lycée Buffon. Rousseau then fulfilled his military obligation in 1931. Certified in Advanced Astronomy in March 1932, he obtained two distinct degrees in Philosophy (Psychology, Morals and Sociology) and in Mathematics and Physics in 1935. = First publications = While working toward his university degrees, Rousseau covered scientific news in several newspapers. His most significant articles were published in La Nature, a popular science magazine founded in 1873 by Gaston Tissandier. His experience as a popular writer fed his future works. His scientific columns earned him a significant number of letters from his readers. = Astronomy = When asked to transfer to the Lycée Félix Faure of Beauvaisin 1935, Rousseau resigned from the Éducation Nationale without hesitation to join the Meudon Observatory as \\"Astronome Stagiaire au Service du Méridien\\" (\\"Trainee Astronomer at the Meridian Study\\"). At the time, French astronomy was under- developed compared to other western nations at the time (namely British, North American and Russian). The total staff of astronomers barely reached 150 in France, and the modernization project of the observatory, set in the Château de Meudon had just started; feeders and racks of the stables where the laboratories were installed had not yet been removed. Dome of the Meudon Observatory installed on top of the former Château de Meudon. Audouin Dollfus, one of the most eminent astronomer in France, son of Charles Dollfus (creator of the Musée de l'Air and Honorary Astronomer at the Paris Observatory), remembers Pierre Rousseau as a young astronomer: \\"Before the War, we were only a fistful. Pierre Rousseau was a modest person, almost too modest, deep, an excellent writer and an excellent popularizer. His books on astronomy are admirable! I read them avidly. To illustrate his Mars, Mysterious Earth, I think he obtained the images from the telescope of Antoniadi himself.\\" In 1939, Rousseau was enlisted and stationed in an artillery battery unit in Lorraine . He writes in Le monde des étoiles (The World of Stars - 1950); \\"Combien de fois l’auteur de ce livre ne l’a-t-il pas contemplé [Jupiter.]… pendant la dernière guerre, avec la modeste « binoculaire » de sa batterie ?\\" (How many times the author of this book contemplated, during the last war, [Jupiter] with his modest binoculars ?). His first book on astronomy (L'Exploration du Ciel - Sky Exploration) was published the same year, at 8.0000 copies. It shows, early on, Rousseau's distinctive love for anecdotes and a particular care to underline the work of scientists and the importance of the history of science. While focusing particularly on astronomy and related sciences, he was also interested in epistemology, astronautics, geology, nuclear physics, and electricity. His last book, L'avenir de la Terre (The Future of Earth) was published in 1977 by Nouvelles Éditions Latines. = Later life = Through the 1950s and 1960s, Rousseau continued his work as a science journalist and popular science writer. His works were translated in several languages and have inspired some of his readers to become astronomers. With his multiple experiences in various scientific domains and the history of science, Rousseau presented himself as a witness of the evolution of scientific progress in the eyes of the public opinion. After the publication of his last essay, The Future Earth, he suffered a stroke at the end of the 1970s. Rousseau then progressively lost his physical and intellectual capacities until his death.  Works  This list includes only the works published in France and a few foreign publications. The list and collection of his work for newspapers and magazines (La Revue de Paris, Historia, Nature, L’œuvre, Marianne, Le Petit Parisien, La Petite Gironde, Science et Vie) are difficult to obtain in its integrity, and are therefore not listed here.

Reception of the tsar of Russia in the Moscow Kremlin, by Ivan Makarov Crowning of Stefan Dušan, Emperor of the Serbs, as tsar, by Paja Jovanović Tsar ( or ), also spelled czar, or tzar or csar, is a title used to designate East and South Slavic monarchs or supreme rulers of Eastern Europe, originally the Bulgarian monarchs from 10th century onwards, much later a title for two rulers of the Serbian State, and from 1547 the supreme ruler of the Tsardom of Russia and the Russian Empire. In this last capacity it lends its name to a system of government, tsarist autocracy or tsarism. The term is derived from the Latin word caesar, which was intended to mean \\"emperor\\" in the European medieval sense of the term—a ruler with the same rank as a Roman emperor, holding it by the approval of another emperor or a supreme ecclesiastical official (the Pope or the Ecumenical Patriarch)—but was usually considered by western Europeans to be equivalent to king, or to be somewhat in between a royal and imperial rank. \\"Tsar\\" and its variants were the official titles of the following states: * First Bulgarian Empire, in 919–1018 * Second Bulgarian Empire, in 1185–1396 * Serbian Empire, in 1346–1371 * Tsardom of Russia, in 1547–1721 (replaced in 1721 by imperator, but still remaining in use, also officially in relation to several regions until 1917) * Tsardom of Bulgaria, in 1908–1946 The first ruler to adopt the title tsar was Simeon I of Bulgaria.\\"Simeon I.\\" Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 12 July 2009, EB.com. Simeon II, the last tsar of Bulgaria, is the last person to have borne the title tsar. Meaning in Slavic languages The title tsar is derived from the Latin title for the Roman emperors, caesar. In comparison to the corresponding Latin word imperator, the Byzantine Greek term basileus was used differently depending on whether it was in a contemporary political context or in a historical or Biblical context. In the history of the Greek language, basileus had originally meant something like \\"potentate\\". It gradually approached the meaning of \\"king\\" in the Hellenistic Period, and it came to designate \\"emperor\\" after the inception in the Roman Empire. As a consequence, Byzantine sources continued to call the Biblical and ancient kings \\"basileus\\" even when that word had come to mean \\"emperor\\" when referring to contemporary monarchs, while it was never applied to Western European kings, whose title was transliterated from Latin rex as , or to other monarchs, for whom designations such as (\\"leader\\", \\"chieftain\\") were used. As the Greek basileus was consistently rendered as \\"tsar\\" in Slavonic translations of Greek texts, the dual meaning was transferred into Church Slavonic. Thus, \\"tsar\\" was not only used as an equivalent of Latin imperator (in reference to the rulers of the Byzantine Empire, the Holy Roman Empire and to native rulers) but was also used to refer to Biblical rulers and ancient kings. From this ambiguity, the development has moved in different directions in the different Slavic languages. Thus, the Bulgarian language and Russian language no longer use \\"tsar\\" as an equivalent of the term imperator as it exists in the West European (Latin) tradition. Currently, the term \\"tsar\\" refers to native sovereigns, ancient and Biblical rulers, as well as monarchs in fairy tales and the like. The title \\"king\\" (Russian korol' , Bulgarian kral-, the origin of which is Charlemagne (Karl)) is sometimes perceived as alien and is by some Russian speakers reserved for (West) European royalty (and, by extension, for those modern monarchs outside of Europe whose titles are translated as \\"king\\" in English, roi in French etc.). Foreign monarchs of imperial status, both inside and outside of Europe, ancient as well as modern, are generally called imperator (император) rather than tsar. In contrast, the Serbocroatian language (which can also be viewed as different languages—Serbian and Croatian) translate \\"emperor\\" as \\"tsar\\" (car, цар) and not as imperator, whereas the equivalent of \\"king\\" (kralj, краљ, король) is used to designate monarchs of non-imperial status, Serbian as well as foreign ancient rulers—like Latin rex. Biblical rulers in Serbian are called цар and in Croatian kralj. In the modern West Slavic languages and Slovene language, the use of the terms is nearly identical to the one in English and German: a king is designated with one term (Czech král, Slovak kráľ, Polish król, Slovene kralj), an emperor is designated with another, derived from caesar as in German (Czech císař, Slovak cisár, Polish cesarz, Slovene cesar; Croatian cesar and Montenegrin ćesar fell into disuse after World War I), while the exotic term \\"tsar\\" (Czech, Slovene and Polish car, Slovak cár) is reserved for the Bulgarian, Russian and Serbian rulers. In the Polish language, by contrast, tsar is used as an equivalent to imperator, never as king. The term tsar is always used to refer to the Russian rulers before Peter the Great, and very often to those succeeding. Bulgaria Mostich's epitaph uses the title tsar (outlined): \\"Here lies Mostich who was ichirgu-boil during the reigns of Tsar Simeon and Tsar Peter. At the age of eighty he forsook the rank of ichirgu boila and all of his possessions and became a monk. And so ended his life.\\" (Museum of Preslav) Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha is the only living person who (as Simeon II) has borne the title \\"tsar\\".Christina Holtz-Bacha, Encyclopedia of Political Communication, Volume 1, with Lynda Lee Kaid, Christina Holtz-Bacha as ed., SAGE, 2008, . p. 115. In 705 Emperor Justinian II named Tervel of Bulgaria \\"caesar\\", the first foreigner to receive this title, but his descendants continued to use Bulgar title \\"Kanasubigi\\". The sainted Boris I is sometimes retrospectively referred to as tsar, because at his time Bulgaria was converted to Christianity. However, the title \\"tsar\\" (and its Byzantine Greek equivalent basileus) was actually adopted and used for the first time by his son Simeon I, following a makeshift imperial coronation performed by the Patriarch of Constantinople in 913. After an attempt by the Byzantine Empire to revoke this major diplomatic concession and a decade of intensive warfare, the imperial title of the Bulgarian ruler was recognized by the Byzantine government in 924 and again at the formal conclusion of peace in 927. Since in Byzantine political theory there was place for only two emperors, Eastern and Western (as in the Late Roman Empire), the Bulgarian ruler was crowned basileus as \\"a spiritual son\\" of the Byzantine basileus.Срђан Пириватрић. Самуилова држава. Београд, 1997. Some of the earliest attested occurrences of the titlo-contraction \\"tsar\\" (car' ) from \\"tsesar\\" (cěsar' ) are found in the grave inscription of the chărgubilja (ichirgu-boil) Mostich, a contemporary of Simeon I and Peter I, from Preslav. It has been hypothesized that Simeon's title was also recognized by a papal mission to Bulgaria in or shortly after 925, as a concession in exchange for a settlement in the Bulgarian-Croatian conflict or a possible attempt to return Bulgaria to union with Rome. Thus, in the later diplomatic correspondence conducted in 1199–1204 between the Bulgarian ruler Kaloyan and Pope Innocent III, Kaloyan—whose self-assumed Latin title was \\"Imperator Bulgarorum et Blachorum\\"—claims that the imperial crowns of Simeon I, his son Peter I, and Samuel were somehow derived from the papacy. The pope, however, only speaks of reges (kings) of Bulgaria in his replies, and eventually grants only that lesser title to Kaloyan, who nevertheless proceeds to thank the pope for the \\"imperial title\\" conferred upon him.Innocentii pp. III epistolae ad Bulgariae historiam spectantes. Recensuit et explicavit Iv. Dujcev. Sofia, 1942. The title, later augmented with epithets and titles such as autocrat to reflect current Byzantine practice, was used by all of Simeon's successors until the complete conquest of Bulgaria by the Ottoman Empire in 1422. In Latin sources the emperor of Bulgaria is sometimes designated \\"emperor of Zagora\\" (with variant spellings). Various additional epithets and descriptions apart, the official style read \\"Emperor and Autocrat of all Bulgarians and Greeks\\". During the five-century period of Ottoman rule in Bulgaria, the sultan was frequently referred to as \\"tsar\\". This may be related to the fact that he had claimed the legacy of the Byzantine Empire or to the fact that the sultan was called basileus in medieval Greek. After Bulgaria's liberation from the Ottomans in 1878, its new monarchs were at first autonomous prince (knyaz). With the declaration of full independence, Ferdinand I of Bulgaria adopted the traditional title \\"tsar\\" in 1908 and it was used until the abolition of the monarchy in 1946. However, these titles were not generally perceived as equivalents of \\"emperor\\" any longer. In the Bulgarian as in the Greek vernacular, the meaning of the title had shiftedНайден Геров. 1895–1904. Речник на блъгарский язик. (the entry on цар in Naiden Gerov's Dictionary of the Bulgarian Language) (although Paisius' Slavonic-Bulgarian History (1760–1762) had still distinguished between the two concepts). Accordingly, while Ferdinand and his successors, Boris III and Simeon II, used the title of \\"tsar\\" in Bulgarian, they used the title of \\"king\\" outside Bulgaria. In the same fashion, the modern rulers of Greece (1821–1923, 1935–1973) used the traditional title of basileus in Greek and the title of \\"king\\" when in English speaking countries. Kievan Rus' \\"Tsar\\" was used once by church officials of Kievan Rus' in the naming of Yaroslav the Wise of Kiev. This may be connected to Yaroslav's war against Byzantium and to his efforts to distance himself from Constantinople. However, other princes of Kievan Rus' never styled themselves as tsars.Wladimir Vodoff. Remarques sur la valeur du terme \\"czar\\" appliqué aux princes russes avant le milieu du 15e siècle, in \\"Oxford Slavonic Series\\", new series, vol. XI. Oxford University Press, 1978. Russian lands used the term tsar from 1547 when Knyaz (Russian: Князь) Ivan IV the Terrible was officially crowned tsar of all Russia. Serbia Dušan of Serbia The title of tsar (Serbian car) was used officially by two monarchs, the previous monarchial title being that of king (kralj). In 1345, Stefan Dušan began to style himself \\"Emperor of Serbs and Greeks\\" (the Greek renderings read \\"basileus and autokrator of Serbs and Romans\\"), and was crowned as such in Skopje on Easter (April 16) 1346 by the newly elevated Serbian patriarch, alongside the Bulgarian patriarch and archbishop of Ohrid. On the same occasion, he had his wife Helena of Bulgaria crowned as empress and his son associated in power as king. When Dušan died in 1355, his son Stefan Uroš V became the next emperor. The new emperor's uncle Simeon Uroš (Siniša) contested the succession and claimed the same titles as a dynast in Thessaly. After his death around 1370, he was succeeded in his claims by his son John Uroš, who retired to a monastery in about 1373. With the extinction of the Nemanjić dynasty in Serbia in 1371, the imperial title became obsolete (though it was retained by Stefan Uroš IV's widow Elena of Bulgaria until her death in 1376/1377). The royal title was preserved by Vukašin Mrnjavčević, a Serbian ruler in Macedonia, who had been associated by Stefan Uroš. Several other Serbian rulers are known as tsars, although they were never recognized as such. These include Tsar Lazar (who was titled autokrator), Tsar Jovan Nenad (self-given) and Tsar Stephen the Little (who claimed to be the Russian Emperor in Montenegro). During the period of the Ottoman rule in Serbia, the sultan was also frequently referred to as tsar, for instance in Serbian epic poetry. Russia The first Russian ruler to openly break with the khan of the Golden Horde, Mikhail of Tver, assumed the title \\"basileus of Rus\\" and \\"czar\\", more commonly spelled \\"tsar\\".A.V. Soloviev. \\"Reges\\" et \\"Regnum Russiae\\" au moyen âge, in \\"Byzantion\\", t. XXXVI. Bruxelles, 1966. Władysław IV of Poland was the tsar of Russia during the Time of Troubles, when the Polish forces occupied Moscow. Following his assertion of independence from the khan, \\"Veliki Kniaz\\" Ivan III of Muscovy started to use the title of tsar () regularly in diplomatic relations with the West. From about 1480, he is designated as \\"imperator\\" in his Latin correspondence, as \\"keyser\\" in his correspondence with the Swedish regent, as \\"kejser\\" in his correspondence with the Danish king, Teutonic Knights, and the Hanseatic League. Ivan's son Vasily III continued using these titles. Sigismund von Herberstein observed that the titles of \\"kaiser\\" and \\"imperator\\" were attempts to render the Russian term \\"tsar\\" into German and Latin, respectively.\\"Den Titel aines Khaisers, wiewol Er alle seine Brief nur Reissisch schreibt, darinn Er sich Czar nent, so schickht Er gemaincklich Lateinische Copeyen darmit oder darinn, und an stat des Czar setzen sy Imperator, den wir Teutsch Khaiser nennen\\". Nicholas II, the last Emperor of Russia. This was related to Russia's growing ambitions to become an Orthodox \\"Third Rome\\", after the Fall of Constantinople. The Muscovite ruler was recognized as an emperor by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I in 1514.Ostrowski, D. (2002) Muscovy and the Mongols: Cross-Cultural Influences on the Steppe Frontier, 1304-1589, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 178Lehtovirta, J. “The Use of Titles in Herberstein's \\"Commentarii\\". Was the Muscovite Tsar a King or an Emperor?” in Kӓmpfer, F. and Frӧtschner, R. (eds.) (2002) 450 Jahre Sigismund von Herbersteins Rerum Moscoviticarum Commentarii 1549-1999, Harrassowitz Verlag, pps. 196-198\\"Kayser vnnd Herscher aller Rewssen und Groszfürste zu Wolodimer\\" in the German text of Maximilian's letter; \\"Imperator et Dominator universorum Rhutenorum et Magnus Princeps Valadomerorum\\" in the Latin copy. Vasily III responded by referring to Maximilian as \\"Maximiliano Dei gratia Electo Romanorum Caesare\\", i.e., \\"Roman Caesar\\". Maximilian's letter was of great importance to Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great, when they wished to back up their titles of \\"tsar\\" and \\"emperor\\", respectively. Both monarchs demonstrated the letter to foreign ambassadors; Peter even referred to it when he proclaimed himself Emperor. However, the first Russian ruler to be formally crowned as Tsar of All Rus () was Ivan IV, until then known as Grand Prince of all the Russias. Some foreign ambassadors—namely, Herberstein (in 1516 and 1525), Daniel Printz a Buchau (in 1576 and 1578) and Just Juel (in 1709)—indicated that the word \\"tsar\\" should not be translated as \\"emperor\\", because it is applied by Russians to David, Solomon and other Biblical kings, who are simple reges.This objection may be used against translating \\"Basileus\\" as \\"emperor\\", too. Based on these accounts, the Popes repeatedly suggested to confer on the Russian monarchs the title of rex (\\"king\\"), if they only ally themselves with Vatican. Such a proposal was made for the last time in 1550, i.e., three years after Ivan IV had crowned himself tsar. As early as 1489, Ivan III declined the papal offer, declaring that his regal authority does not require anyone's confirmation. On the other hand, Jacques Margeret, a bodyguard of False Demetrius I, argues that the title of \\"tsar\\" is more honorable for Muscovites than \\"kaiser\\" or \\"king\\" exactly because it was God and not some earthly potentate who ordained to apply it to David, Solomon, and other kings of Israel.\\"Et ainsi retiennent le nom de Zar comme plus autentique, duquel nom il pleut iadis à Dieu d'honorer David, Salomon et autres regnans sur la maison de Iuda et Israel, disent-ils, et que ces mots Tsisar et Krol n'est que invention humaine, lequel nom quelqu'un s'est acquis par beaux faits d'armes\\". Samuel Collins, a court physician to Tsar Alexis in 1659–66, styled the latter \\"Great Emperour\\", commenting that \\"as for the word Czar, it has so near relation to Cesar... that it may well be granted to signifie Emperour. The Russians would have it to be an higher title than King, and yet they call David Czar, and our kings, Kirrols, probably from Carolus Quintus, whose history they have among them\\".The Present State of Russia, in a Letter to a Friend at London. Written by an Eminent Person residing at Great Tzars Court at Mosco for the space of nine years. 2nd ed. London, 1671. Pages 54–55. In 1610 Sigismund III of Poland manipulated his son Władysław IV's election as tsar of Russia while Polish forces held Moscow during the Time of Troubles following the death of Boris Godunov. His election, which never resulted in his assumption of the Muscovite throne, was part of an unsuccessful plan by Sigismund to conquer all of Russia and convert the population to Catholicism. As a young man Władysław showed ability as a military leader in operations against Muscovy (1617–18) and the Ottoman Empire (1621). In 1670, Pope Clement X expressed doubts that it would be appropriate for him to address Alexis as \\"tsar\\", because the word is \\"barbarian\\" and because it stands for an emperor, a title reserved for the Holy Roman Emperor. Abbot Scarlati's opined that the term is not translatable and therefore may be used by the Pope without any harm. In order to settle the matter and to assert his imperial ambitions more clearly, Peter I the Great issued an edict that raised Russia to an empire and decreed that the Latin title imperator should be used instead of tsar (1721). The title tsar remained in common usage, and also officially as the designator of various titles signifying rule over various states absorbed by the Muscovite monarchy (such as the former Tatar khanates and the Georgian Orthodox kingdom). In the 18th century, it was increasingly viewed as inferior to \\"emperor\\" or highlighting the oriental side of the term.Boris Uspensky. Царь и император: помазание на трон и семантика монарших титулов. Moscow: Языки русской культуры, 2000. . Pages 48–52. Upon annexing Crimea in 1783, Catherine the Great adopted the hellenicized title \\"tsaritsa of Tauric Chersonesos\\", rather than \\"tsaritsa of the Crimea\\". By 1815, when a large part of Poland was annexed, the title had clearly come to be interpreted in Russia as the equivalent of Polish król (\\"king\\"), and the Russian emperor assumed the title \\"tsar of Poland\\". Since the word \\"tsar\\" remained the popular designation of the Russian ruler despite the official change of style, it is commonly used in foreign languages such as English. Metaphorical uses Like many lofty titles, such as mogul, tsar or czar has been used in English as a metaphor for positions of high authority since 1866 (referring to U.S. President Andrew Johnson), with a connotation of dictatorial powers and style, fitting since \\"autocrat\\" was an official title of the Russian Emperor (informally referred to as 'the tsar'). Similarly, Speaker of the House Thomas Brackett Reed was called \\"Czar Reed\\" for his dictatorial control of the House of Representatives in the 1880s and 1890s. In the United States and in the United Kingdom the title \\"czar\\" is a colloquial term for certain high-level civil servants, such as the \\"drug czar\\" for the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (not to be confused with a drug baron), \\"terrorism czar\\" for a presidential advisor on terrorism policy, \\"cybersecurity czar\\" for the highest-ranking Department of Homeland Security official on computer security and information security policy, and \\"war czar\\" to oversee the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. More specifically, a czar in the US government typically refers to a sub-cabinet-level advisor within the executive branch. One of the earliest known usages of the term was for Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who was named commissioner of baseball, with broad powers to clean up the sport after it had been sullied by the Black Sox scandal of 1919.

History of Hakla By one account, the history of Hakla can be traced back to the time of Alexander The Great's invasion of India and his subsequent campaigns including the advance through the Jhelum River. It is claimed that one of his soldiers who belonged to Macedonia and had a similar name to Hakla got injured in the Battle of the Hydaspes and stayed back in the city of Bucephala (A city founded in order to commemorate the death of Alexander's horse, Sarosh. Later he and his family along with a couple of others migrated and came to present site of the village Hakla and established a small hut at with his own name. Over the passage of time the population of the settlement grew, but due to its location and proximity from sources of water, Hakla did not grow to become a major population centre.

History  Willunga was an inaugural member of the South Australian Football Association (SAFA), a precursor to the South Australian National Football League (SANFL). Willunga left SAFA to become a foundation member of the Southern Football Association in 1886. By 1891, the Southern Football Association was in recess and Willunga played “challenge” matches against various towns in the region. In the year of 1892, Willunga declared itself “Premiers of the South”, having played eight first-class matches, winning six and drawing two. Former logo of Willunga Football Club In 1892, plans began to reform the Southern Football Association, and Willunga joined the Sellick’s Hill and Aldinga clubs in this revived competition in 1893, winning the premiership in the first season. Willunga remained a member of the Southern Football Association, later Southern Football League for all seasons it was in operation until the end of the 1985 season, when they transferred to the Great Southern Football League for the 1986 season, ironically the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Southern Football League. Willunga had previously been accepted into the Great Southern League for the 1976 season, however an amendment to the Southern League's constitution blocked the move at that time. The Willunga FC continues to field teams in Senior and Junior grades in the Great Southern Football League. Willunga FC has produced a number of Australian Football League (AFL/VFL) players including Randall Bone (Adelaide, Hawthorn), Ben Thompson (St Kilda) and Tom Waye (Footscray).

Biography Schwartz wrote for some of the best known comedians of the era, including Lucille Ball, Groucho Marx, and Bob Hope. Schwartz was also one of the head writers for Gilligan's Island, a CBS sitcom which was created by his brother, Sherwood Schwartz. Schwartz was born in Passaic, New Jersey, on June 23, 1923. His brothers included Al Schwartz and Sherwood Schwartz. He moved to the Bronx with his family, where he attended school. He attended New York University and enlisted in the United States Air Force as an NYU student. He spent two years in the Air Force before moving to Los Angeles with his family. He wrote for radio in California and then moved back to New York City. He wrote for game shows in New York during the 1950s before returning to Los Angeles. Schwartz screenwriting credits included numerous television sitcoms, game shows, and dramas. He wrote scripts and other material for You Bet Your Life, a quiz show hosted by Groucho Marx, as well as The $64,000 Question during the 1950s. His work on television dramas included The Six Million Dollar Man and It Takes a Thief during the late 1960s and 1970s. Schwartz is perhaps best known for his work as a principal writer for Gilligan's Island, which aired from 1964 to 1967. In 1964, Schwartz's brother, Sherwood Schwartz, hired his brother to write and edit the scripts for his upcoming series about a group of seven castaways stranded on an island after a \\"three-hour tour.\\" Elroy Schwartz noted in a later interview that many of the show's writers didn't think the sitcom would work due to its unrealistic premise, saying \\"They couldn’t believe you could get 30 episodes out of seven people stranded on an island.\\" In addition to the series, Schwartz also penned the scripts for several of Gilligan's Islands television movies, including the two-part 1978 film, Rescue from Gilligan's Island, The Castaways on Gilligan's Island in 1979, and The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island in 1981. Outside of television, Schwartz was a licensed hypnotherapist with an office in Palm Springs. He also pursued in past life regressions, painted, and authored several non-fiction and fictional books. Schwartz was a longtime resident of Palm Springs, California for more than thirty years. He died from complications of surgery at Odyssey House in Palm Desert, California, on June 14, 2013, at the age of 89 (just nine days short of his 90th birthday). He was survived by his wife of 67 years, Beryl, their two daughters, Nan Schwartz and Jill Moramarco, and one granddaughter.

Biography Leonard Pelham Lee was born as the son of Horace Pelham Lee on 31 May 1903. He joined Coventry Climax Engines in 1919 and became a Director in 1927. He married Ivy D. Jones in 1933, and had a son, Charles Pelham Lee. In 1953, he was appointed Chairman and Managing Director of Coventry Climax Engines on the death of his father, who was the founder/owner. He was appointed Chairman (formerly Joint MD) of Godiva Fire Pumps in 1957. He lived at Park House, Warwick Road, Coventry, and was appointed the Chairman of British Internal Combustion Engine Manufacturers Association in 1960 at age 57. He died in 1980 in Warwickshire, England. Formula One In 1961, Coventry Climax was dominating the British Formula One field with the successful FPF and FWMV engines, but FWMV's initial selling price (3,000 Pounds), though considerably higher than the selling price of FPF (2,250 Pounds), did not cover the development cost and the mounting maintenance cost as more and more teams wanted to run it. He announced that the situation is the equivalent of his company subsidising the teams, so that the company will withdraw from Formula One racing at the end of the year. As the customer teams did not have alternative engine suppliers, and thus being totally dependent on the supply of the FWMV engine, the teams got together and negotiated with Lee so that Oil company sponsorship funds would be funneled through the teams to Coventry Climax to cover the mounting costs, and Lee agreed to continue the development and support of these engines. This incident became the seed for the formation of Formula One Constructors Association later in the 1970s. Dewar Trophy In May 1964, the Royal Automobile Club presented the Dewar Trophy, which is given at the recommendation of RAC's Technical and Engineering Committee for the most outstanding British achievement in the automotive field, to Leonard Pelham Lee. The citation reads: \\"Awarded to Coventry Climax Engines Ltd. for the design, development and production of engines which have brought British cars to the forefront in the field of Grand Prix racing.\\" History of this trophy dates back to 1906.

Unraced as a two-year-old, Medicean ran eight times in 2000, winning the Celebration Mile and finishing third in both the St James's Palace Stakes and the Sussex Stakes. In the early part of the following year, the colt showed his best form, winning the Lockinge Stakes, Queen Anne Stakes and Eclipse Stakes. He was retired to stud at the end of the year and had considerable success as a sire of winners. Background Medicean was a chestnut horse standing 16.1 hands high with a narrow white blaze and a long white sock on his left hind leg bred and owned by the Newmarket-based Cheveley Park Stud. He was sired by Machiavellian, an American-bred, French-trained racehorse who was one of the leading European two-year-olds of his generation, winning the Prix Morny and the Prix de la Salamandre in 1989. He later became a very successful breeding stallion, siring leading winners including Almutawakel, Street Cry and Storming Home. Medicean' dam Mystic Goddess was a successful racehorse whose wins included the Sweet Solera Stakes in 1992. Mystic Goddess was descended from the broodmare Life Hill, whose other descendants include the Belmont Stakes winner Sherluck and the Poule d'Essai des Poulains winner Caro. The colt was sent into training with Michael Stoute at his Freemason Lodge stable in Newmarket. Medicean was described by his groom, Angela Perry as being a \\"quiet and lazy\\" horse, whilst Brough Scott called him \\"almost lethargically laid-back\\". Racing career =2000: three-year-old season= Medicean did not race as a two-year-old: when he arrived at Stoute's stable he was described as resembling \\"two boards put together\\" and underwent an operation after developing colic. He made his racecourse debut in April 2000 when he finished third of the twenty-one runners in the Wood Ditton Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse. Nine days later he recorded his first success in a minor stakes race at Sandown Park Racecourse, catching Man o' Mystery in the last stride to win by a short head. On 1 June he was sent north to Ayr Racecourse for another minor stakes and won \\"readily\\" from five opponents. Less than three weeks later, Medicean was moved up sharply in class for the Group One St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot. Starting a 16/1 outsider, he exceeded expectations by finishing third, less than a length behind the winner Giant's Causeway. On his next appearance, the colt moved up in distance for the John Smith's Cup, an all-aged handicap race over ten and a half furlongs at York Racecourse. Carrying a weight of 112 pounds he started the 5/2 favourite, despite Stoute's concerns about the soft ground, but made no impression in the race and finished fourteenth of the twenty-two runners. In his three remaining races of the year, Medicean returned to weight-for-age races and the one mile distance. On 2 August he finished third behind the joint-favourites Giant's Causeway and Dansili in the Group One Sussex Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse, beaten two and a quarter lengths by the winner. At the end of the month, he returned to Goodwood for the Celebration Mile in which he was opposed by the Jersey Stakes winner Observatory and by Bachir, who had defeated Giant's Causeway in the Irish 1,000 Guineas. Ridden by the forty-eight-year-old Pat Eddery, Medicean tracked Bachir before taking the lead three furlongs from the finish. Under a hard ride from Eddery, Medicean recorded hi first important success, beating Observatory by a length. On his final race as a three-year- old, he finished fourth behind Observatory, Giant's Causeway and Best of the Bests in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot in September. =2001: four- year-old season= Medicean remained in training as a four-year-old in 2001, when he was ridden in all of his races by Kieren Fallon. On his first appearance of the year he contested the Group One Lockinge Stakes over one mile at Newbury Racecourse on 19 May. Fallon restrained the colt towards the rear of the seven runner field before making his challenge in the final furlong. Medicean caught the leaders in the final strides and won in a three- way photo-finish from Warningford and Swallow Flight. Explaining his decision to wait till the last moment to deliver his challenge, Fallon said \\"He's a horse who needs to be ridden that way. When he hits the front he thinks he's done enough. It was a surprise that he won, because a lot of our horses are just needing the run. I thought he would have, but his ability got him through it.\\" At Royal Ascot in June the colt started at odds of 11/2 for the Queen Anne Stakes (then a Group Two race) in which he carried a five-pound weight penalty following his Group One win. He took the lead two furlongs from the finish and was driven out by Fallon to win by a length from Swallow Flight. On 7 July, Medicean was one of eight horses to contest the 104th running of the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown. His opponents included Grandera, Tobougg, Black Minnaloushe (winner of the Irish 2,000 Guineas and St James's Palace Stakes) and Endless Hall (winner of the Singapore Airlines International Cup). Racing over ten furlongs for the second time in his racing career, Medicean was held up by Fallon at the back of the field as a very strong pace was set by Broche and Darwin. Medicean moved into contention in the straight, but came under pressure and appeared to be struggling before rallying in the closing stages to win by half a length from Grandera, with Bach in third place. At York Racecourse in August Medicean started 3/1 second favourite for the International Stakes over ten and a half furlongs and finished third of the eight runners, eight lengths behind the winner Sakhee. Medicean was expected to race again in autumn, with the Champion Stakes and the Breeders' Cup Mile regarded as potential targets. In October, he sustained an injury to his right foreleg in training and was retired from racing. Stoute paid tribute to the colt on his retirement, saying: \\"He was a model of consistency throughout his career and always showed great courage. That's exactly what he showed when winning the Eclipse, but I felt his performance in the Queen Anne with a penalty was outstanding.\\" Stud record Medicean was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at the Cheveley Park Stud where he stood at an initial fee of £15,000. His fee later rose to £30,000 in 2008 but dropped to £6,000 to £8,000 towards the end of his career. He has sired the winner of over 500 races. His major winners include: *Nannina (bay filly 2003), Fillies' Mile, Coronation Stakes *Dutch Art (chestnut colt 2004), Prix Morny, Middle Park Stakes, sire of Slade Power *Al Shemali (chestnut colt 2004), Dubai Duty Free Stakes *Capponi (chestnut colt 2004), Al Maktoum Challenge *Mr Medici (bay colt 2005), Hong Kong Champions & Chater Cup *Siyouma (bay filly 2008), Sun Chariot Stakes, E. P. Taylor Stakes *Bayrir (bay colt 2009), Secretariat Stakes In 2017 Medicean was retired from stud duty after developing fertility problems. He died after a suspected heart attack at Cheveley Park Stud on 30 August 2018. Stud manager Chris Richardson said \\"His progeny have excelled at the highest level and I'm sure his legacy will be influential for years to come.\\" Pedigree References External links * Medicean at Chevely Park Stud Category:1997 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 3-o Category:2018 racehorse deaths ","title":"Medicean (horse)"},{"id":"39880869","text":"Berosus trilobus is a species of hydrophilid beetles from the Dominican Republic and Cuba.

Descent of the manor The Domesday Book of 1086 records Monkleigh as Lege, the ninth of the 79 holdings in Devon as tenant-in-chief, of Robert, Count of Mortain (-1090) the half-brother of William the Conqueror. His tenant at Monkleigh was a certain Alured, modernised to Alfred.

James Coffin was the second son of John Coffin of Portledge, in the parish of Alwington. He was still living in 1551 when he was mentioned in the will of his eldest brother Richard Coffin (died 1555) of Portledge. The Coffin family is one of the most ancient of Devon families. Tristram Risdon (died 1640) stated: \\"Alwington...the manor whereof hath been in the name of Coffin even from The Conquest\\".Risdon, p. 243 On 11 June 1544 the crown granted the manor of Monkleigh, subject to the life interest of James Coffin and his wife, to Sir John Fulford of Dunsford and Humphrey Colles of Barton, Somerset, along with other grants of property. For Monkleigh manor they were charged £194 3s 4d, representing 10 years' purchase of its annual value. They were also granted Monkleigh Woods for £29 13s 6d, representing 20 years' purchaseYouings, p. 39 Fulford and Coles paid the purchase price in full on 2 June 1544 and just one week later obtained royal licence to alienate to James Coffin of Alwington, the life tenant.Youings, p.41, Grant 45 A small monumental brass of a kneeling knight exists in Monkleigh Church high up on the north wall of the chancel, affixed to a stone tablet on which are sculpted several heraldic escutcheons of the arms of Coffin (Azure, three bezants between eight crosses crosslet or)Vivian, p. 208 impaling arms of their heiresses.

The post-Dissolution lords of the manor of Monkleigh had their main residence elsewhere outside the parish at Portledge, Alwington,Pevsner, p. 690 and thus Annery was the most important seat within the manor and the successive holders of it had their own chapel within the parish church, at the east end of the south aisle, known as the \\"Annery Chapel\\".

Most of the dead were students, with some staff members also killed. Background The Boko Haram (sometimes referred to as the Nigerian Taliban) was founded in 2002 to seek the establishment of an Islamic state and fight against the Westernization of Nigeria, which the group maintains is the root cause of criminal behaviour in that country. From 2009 to 2013, violence linked to the Boko Haram insurgency resulted in 3,600 deaths, including 1,600 civilians. In mid-May 2013, Nigeria declared a state of emergency in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe States, as it aimed to end the Boko Haram insurgency. The resulting crackdown has led to the capture or killing of hundreds of Boko Haram members, with the remainder retreating to mountainous areas from which they have increasingly targeted civilians. Since 2010, Boko Haram has targeted schools, killing hundreds of students. A spokesperson said such attacks would continue as long as government soldiers continued to interfere with traditional Koran-based education. More than 10,000 children are no longer able to attend school due to attacks by the Boko Haram. Roughly 20,000 people fled Yobe State to Cameroon during June 2013 to escape the violence. In June 2013, Nigerian soldiers beat students at a Koran-based school, angering Boko Haram members. An attack on June 16 by Boko Haram militants killed seven children, two teachers, two soldiers, and two militants. The next day, militants killed nine students who were taking exams. On 4 July, gunmen attacked and killed a school headmaster and his family. Mamudo is from Potiskum town, a commercial center and focal point of the Boko Haram insurgency. Attack Before dawn on 6 July, gunmen attacked a government-run boarding school of 1,200 students in Mamudo village, Yobe State, Nigeria, killing at least 42 people. A local eyewitness described the situation: \\"It was a gory sight ... There were 42 bodies, most of them were students. Some of them had parts of their bodies blown off and badly burnt while others had gunshot wounds.\\" Most of the dead were students, with a few staff members and a teacher also killed. Some were burned alive while others died of gunshot wounds. At the morgue, parents struggled to identify their children, as many bodies were burned beyond recognition. Survivors were taken to a nearby clinic, guarded by the Nigerian army. According to survivors, the gunmen gathered the victims in a central location and then began shooting and throwing explosives. The assailants also brought fuel to set the school on fire. Six students who escaped were found hiding in the bushes with gunshot wounds and taken to the hospital. More than 100 others were missing as of 6 July. Reactions On 7 July 2013, Yobe governor Ibrahim Geidam called the attackers cold-blooded murderers and \\"devoid of any shred of humanity\\". He ordered all secondary schools in the state to close until September, the start of the new academic year. He also requested that the national government end the cell phone outage in the state, saying the lack of cell service prevented citizens from alerting authorities of suspicious people in the area prior to the attack.

Biography Nio was born on 29 December 1904 in Batavia, Dutch East Indies (now Jakarta, Indonesia), the son of a rich batik merchant and his wife. After elementary school and home-schooling in the Chinese language, as a teenager Nio began studying to become an aircraft maintenance engineer, a trade rare in the Dutch East Indies. Although he completed his studies in 1924, Nio was unable to enter the field; his father had died recently and his mother had been cheated out of the factory. Instead Nio, with the help of Lauw Giok Lan, his classmate's father, became a journalist with the newspaper Keng Po. From 1928 to 1935 he served as its editor before a reorganization in 1935 when he left for Sin Po, a competing paper. In after transferring to Sin Po, Nio generally avoided mixing politics with his journalism, focusing instead on culture. Meanwhile, he wrote articles on various topics, including Chinese Malay literature, in Dutch journals such as De Indische Gids as well as English ones such as The China Journal. By this time he had become active in social work with the Tiong Hoa Hwe Koan, serving as its secretary. In 1939 Nio was part of a team which wrote a book commemorating the Tiong Hoa Hwe Koan's 40th anniversary. When the Japanese occupied the Indies in February 1942, Nio was one of at least 542 ethnic Chinese from Java and Madura who were arrested and detained. He was held in Bukit Duri, then Serang, and then Cimahi, before ultimately being released in 1945 after the Japanese surrender and Indonesian proclamation of independence. A written account of his experiences while an internee was published in 1946, with the title Dalem Tawanan Djepang. Sinologist Myra Sidharta describes it as valuable account of history, as other former prisoners did not write such detailed memoirs. Following his release Nio returned to Batavia (since renamed Jakarta) and Sin Po (which had recently restarted publication after three years of inactivity), heading that newspaper until 1958. At the same time he established the family-magazine Pantja Warna (1947–56). In the late 1950s Nio enrolled himself at the Jakarta Teachers' College, studying history. By 1963 he was a lecturer there, teaching history, while working freelance to translate works of Chinese literature, including parts of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, the Ballad of Hua Mulan, and The Creation of the Gods. After 1965 he began writing more on the ethnic Dutch of the Indies. Nio continued writing until 1972, dying on 13 February of the following year. According to Sidharta, during his life Nio produced almost 200 written works; nearly all were about the ethnic Chinese in Indonesia.

He was also on the books at Chelsea and Bournemouth but failed to make an appearance for either team. Career Born in Marylebone, London, Smith joined Chelsea from non-league Wealdstone in May 1950. He spent two seasons at Stamford Bridge but couldn't break into the first-team. He then moved to Bournemouth where he spent a further season with no first-team appearances. In the 1953–54 season, Smith accumulated 12 goals in 38 games for Watford, where he moved following his frustrating season with Bournemouth. After a dispute with one of the Watford directors, Smith signed for Northampton Town for a fee of £5,000 but again fell out with his employers after notching 12 goals in 53 league appearances. Colchester United manager Benny Fenton signed Smith in June 1956 and scored 13 times in 35 appearances in a season where Colchester ran rivals Ipswich Town close for the Third Division South title. Smith's Colchester debut came in the Essex derby on the opening day of the 1956–57 season where the U's won 3–2 at Layer Road. He opened his account four days later at Crystal Palace with a hat-trick, and scored a further treble against Reading on 19 January 1957. While playing for Colchester, Smith lived in London and requested a transfer in June 1957 to reduce the amount of travelling required. The U's sold Smith to Queens Park Rangers for more than they initially paid for him, ending his spell with the club with a record of 13 goals in 35 league matches. QPR did not get a great return on their investment in Smith as he could score only one goal in 17 games during a stint blighted by injury, including a several-month stay on the sidelines with a knee injury. After a single season with the R's, Smith again moved on, this time to Chelmsford City and then Wisbech Town. After Smith retired from the game, he started his own electrical business in the Willesden area. He died in April 1993.

She is a household name in Taiwan. A generation of Taiwanese have sat before their television sets transfixed by Yang's performances, forgetting for an hour's entertainment that a woman is playing the lead male role. Reputation With her distinctive eyes, Yang could make herself at turns commanding and tender. She had a sophisticated air about her, and her voice sounded honest and full of emotion. Since her first appearance more than 40 years ago at age 22, she has been in nearly 170 productions on TTV. She specializes in male roles, playing everything from emperors and aristocrats to warriors and beggars. She has become a favorite of young and old Taiwanese, and many women have come to think of her as the ideal lover. Female fans crowd around the TV studio bearing fancy gifts and creating traffic jams. Thousands of letters swamped the Taiwan TV station, and supplies of pictures of her in traditional dress could not meet demand. People followed her wherever she went, and many female overseas Chinese asked her permission to become her godmother or godsister. In 1996, Yang was voted one of the ten hottest idols by a gay and lesbian organization-despite being over fifty. Early life Yang was born into a family with a strong theatrical background in Yuanshan, Yilan County, the original hometown of Taiwanese opera. Her grandfather was organiser of an amateur \\"peikuan orchestra group\\". And she was thoroughly imbued with what she had heard and seen from childhood, since her mother, Hsiao Chang-sou (stage name), was herself a famous male role-player with a Taiwanese opera group in Yilan County. During that time, it was common for actors and actresses in Taiwan Opera troupes to bring their children with them on tour. As the troupes moved from place to place, these children often played behind the stage, or watched their parents acting. As Yang became her mother's loyal fan, she vowed at the early age of four to devote her own life to Taiwanese opera. Practically born onstage, Yang began to play walk-on roles when she was 4 years old. At the age of 7, she played the lead in a play called An-An Chases Chickens 《安安趕雞》 and captured the hearts of her audience. “I was born in a rural Ilan County village and I do not have a prominent family background, but my mother is also a ke-tsai-hsi actress. Without mother, I wouldn't be where I am today,” she said. \\"Mother carried me along with her theatrical group from the time I was one month old. During a vagrant child's life, I learned to imitate the adults' postures and gestures, and to hum their songs,\\" she recalled. She was especially affected by two childhood episodes. The first occurred when she was only five years old. She had travelled with her mother's opera group to Penghu Island. Since she found everything strange and new, she wandered off and lost her way. A man named Chen A-chih found her wandering, took her in, and began to take care of her. Uncle Chen loved opera and enjoyed humming the melodies, so Yang felt as much at home with this “uncle” as with members of the troupe and entirely forgot about her mishap. Uncle Chen brought her along to the performance and, suddenly finding the setting familiar, she ran backstage to find her mother. After a happy reunion, Yang acquired a nickname, \\"Ah Luo,\\" the name Uncle Chen called her by. The second event occurred while she was practising martial arts at the theatre. Caressing a scar on the left side of her forehead, she recalled: \\"While I was rehearsing a battle scene, my forehead was pierced by my opponent's sword. This mark has become part of my identification.\\" She travelled from town to town until she reached school age. And though she finally entered primary school in her home village, she could never forget the colorful and resplendent days with the opera. The sonorous gongs and songs, the gorgeous costumes and headpieces, and even the great long water-sleeves rose before her eyes. She would visit her parents during school vacations, and one time during a visit when it was time to go back to Ilan, she hopped off the train at the last minute. No matter how her parents pleaded with or scolded her, she was determined to stay and study Taiwanese opera. At that point began the hardest part of her life. She started to undergo strict training from opera veteran Hsiao Chang-sou, her mother and instructor. Yang first practised proper ways of walking across the stage, and of conditioning by stretching muscles in her legs, and such basic movements as jumping, fist- fighting, turning somersaults, rolling on the ground, and wielding weapons. And she learned all kinds of lyrics and singing. Yang said: \\"I had to get up before daybreak and study hard according to the master's instructions.\\" She's been performing ever since. That was in the 1950s when Taiwanese opera was being performed in theaters rather than outdoors as it had been traditionally. Yang's parents were members of a touring troupe and for years the entire family of seven traveled with them, living out their lives backstage. Later, with the rising popularity of Taiwanese-language movies, opera theaters were converted into movie theaters and indoor opera began to disappear. Yang, the eldest daughter of the family, often went hungry so her younger brothers and sisters would have enough to eat. She vowed to make it big and lift her family out of poverty. Early career and broadcasting She made her starring debut at age 16 in the opera Lu Wen-long 《陸文龍》. Despite her youth, she captured well the conflicting emotions of gratitude and revenge. Her delicate evocations of mood —sometimes tender sometimes irritable — won ovations. Her well-received performance caught the eye of the Sai Chin Pao opera troupe and the troupe took her on. Her \\"handsome\\" appearance and superb technique at once made her the pillar of the Sai-Chin-Pao ke-tsai-hsi group and she was promoted alongside Hsiao Ming-ming (), Hsiao Feng-hsien (), and other popular stars as the troupe's \\"Seven Immortals\\"(). Since this group was quite famous at that time, the overseas Chinese community in the Philippines invited it to perform in Manila for six months. They went on a six-month tour of the Philippines, where there were many wealthy ethnic Chinese. Though it was hard for Yang to be away from home for the first time, Yang admitted that she had a \\"fringe benefit\\" in Manila—four fan-mothers and a fan-sister were so enthusiastic that they followed along to \\"take care of\\" Yang and still do so today....She earned enough money to buy a house for her parents, the first they had ever owned and developed a Southeast Asian fan base. \\"Ever since then, my family has been able to live a comfortable, secure life,\\" she said proudly. She returned to Taiwan to find that opera was in even worse shape than before. It was largely relegated to outdoor religious ceremonies, weddings, and funerals, so opportunities to perform were few. Many artists were forced to find sidelines. By the year 1962, the vigorous development of the domestic TV and movie industries had resulted in a reduction in the island's 200-odd theatrical groups—down to 30. Yang's group struggled, then was disbanded in 1964. Though she'd just returned from a successful tour, she was to be out of work for an entire year. Yang returned to her village to cure the wounds in her heart. During this period, she would wander the paddy fields, disquieted, impelled by some unknown mechanical drive. Like other young people of the time, she harboured a great passion for the future, but in the face of the irresistible tides of change, she had lost her destination. \\"Am I to trace my mother's footsteps and lead a vagrant life, changing friends and stages all the time? Sorrowfully, the audiences are not so enthusiastic now. At best, I can only live from hand to mouth,\\" she said to herself. At a time when most performing artists were turning their backs to Taiwanese opera, Yang tried her luck with several other groups, finally joining the Tien Ma Group in 1965. And this was the watershed of Yang's career. In an attempt to instill new life into Taiwanese opera, some opera enthusiasts decided to try to re-popularise this folk drama via radio, and performances by the Tien Ma Group were broadcast live throughout the island. Yang became a radio performer, renewing her faith in the opera. At that time, if you travelled the inner streets and alleys, you would always find the native Taiwanese all listening to Taiwanese opera on the radio. Housewives and aged women showed special interest. Yang recalled the thrill: \\"I never dreamed that my Taiwanese opera would be able to reach so many people through a microphone.\\" People regularly gathered around radios to listen to Yang singing Xue Dingshan 《薛丁山》. \\"I never realized that a Taiwanese opera performance doesn't have to rely on bodily motions,\\" she says. \\"You can make opera lovers hear it all with just a microphone.\\" As there was no audience watching, money could be saved by having one performer use different voices to play several characters at the same time. Performing in falsetto was hard on Yang, who in the past had always pushed her voice low to play male characters. But the experience gave new exposure to her talents. Performing opera using only her voice was not Yang's greatest challenge. In 1966, black- and-white television had just come to Taiwan. The only television station at the time, TTV, was also looking to add Taiwanese opera to its programming. Yang's troupe, Tienma, beat out the competition with a performance of Loyal Yue Fei 《岳飛》 with her in the lead. It won a weekly spot on television. Yang's appearance on the medium did prove to be a shock to her fans. Audiences were fans of Yang's radio singing, but they had never seen her before. Her TV debut captivated the TV audience. On Thursday afternoons as the theme to Taiwan Television's opera hour played, young and old would gather around the set. Everyone wanted to see the Tienma Opera Troupe and its young star, Yang Li- hua, perform moving tales of loyalty and devotion. They were entranced by her exquisite performance, and by the dazzling costumes and TV set-up. She even began to lure many who had never bothered with Taiwanese opera before. Yang's television performances won high praise and made her a household name. Thousands of letters from men and women, old and young, swamped the Taiwan TV station, and supplies of pictures of her in traditional dress could not meet demand. People followed her wherever she went, and many female overseas Chinese asked her permission to become her godmother or godsister. Yang Li-hua eventually became the superstar of Taiwanese opera. \\"It is stressful doing a live TV broadcast,\\" she says. \\"You can't make any mistakes at all in positioning or staging. At that time, the performances were not recorded, so I could never see how I did. I could only get feedback from family and friends afterwards.\\" Yang's mother was her most loyal viewer, and the advice she gave was professional and straightforward. Yang owes a lot to her mother's input. Every few years, Li-hua goes on tour throughout the island or abroad. She faces seas of people. Before a performance, it is quite common for captivated people to swarm to her and place gold pendants around her neck, Others throw money in red gift packs onto the stage to demonstrate their admiration. Reform and reinvention Despite her popularity, Yang never forgot her own advice:“Keep on Advancing All the Time”. In 1969, when Yang was 25, the TV station's general manager appointed her the leader of the Taiwan Television Opera Troupe, and also made her the show's producer. The plays she produced drew huge television audiences. Three years later, she integrated all the Taiwanese opera troupes in Taiwan to form the TTV United Taiwanese opera Troupe. In 1980, Yang laid down three objectives for the future: * First, she wanted to raise the standards of the production and performance of Taiwanese opera. * Second, she wished to reinforce basic research and development work - in which connection, she asked specialists to help gather the original songs, fast fading away, as well to compile new material. * Third, she wanted to support training for actors interested in performing Taiwanese opera. Yang contemplated the notion that Taiwanese opera might die someday unless an effort is made to cultivate a younger generation of actors. To perpetuate the art form, in cooperation with TTV, she organized a Taiwanese opera Training Class in 1981 to train the Taiwanese opera stars of tomorrow. She went from being a simple performer to a figure who would determine the future of the art form. She felt that traditional Taiwanese Opera was held back by the stage-not only were the backdrops and props simplistic, there were also only two or three actors in each scene. On TV, it all came across as cheap and fake. She pushed for more lifelike productions, with more attention paid to props and costumes. She made sure that the staging seemed more realistic-an emperor, for example, should be surrounded by eunuchs and ministers, has the proper crown, and royal robes embroidered with dragons. His residence must be grandiose and gorgeous. And the famed Judge Bao should be accompanied by his enforcers. Also, as producer she took steps to make the productions more dramatic. Actors in Taiwanese Opera traditionally had a lot of leeway in how they presented their characters, but Yang held tighter control. In addition to having script outlines made, she also hired Ti Shan to write new pieces and Chen Tsung-ming to direct. She created stronger parts for actors playing male roles. She also had people search for lost Taiwanese Opera plays, write new melodies, and develop new singing styles. Due to political restrictions at the time, Taiwanese Opera could only be on the air for 30 minutes. With commercials and credits, there were only about 23 minutes for the opera itself. A tight pace had to be maintained so all the lines could be sung and all the actions could be performed, so Yang cut out long, slow weeping scenes and tried to stick with faster-paced material. She added detailed dialogue and choreography. Though older audiences resisted these changes, the performances won larger audiences and brought Taiwanese Opera into the age of television. Touched by the passion of her audiences, the celebrated performer decided to hold a workshop to return to society some of the love that fans have given to her over the years. From advertisements that she ran, Yang selected 40 students for the workshop—which aimed to preserve Taiwanese opera by cultivating future talents. She is determined to pass the torch of her native art down to coming generations. Career successes For decades, Yang produced one success after another: Seven Heroes and Five Gallants 《七俠五義》, The Legend of the Yang Clan 《楊家將》, Xue Rengui Conquers the East 《薛仁貴》, Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai 《梁山伯與祝英台》 and A Civet for a Prince 《狸貓換太子》 were all hits. The 1979 production A Hero's Shadow in the Autumn Frost 《俠影秋霜》 used cinematic special effects to heighten the excitement of sword fighting scenes. The following year, Xue Pinggui 《薛平貴》 was the first Taiwanese opera to be filmed outdoors, with actors riding horses across sands. The 1992 production The Patrolman and the Thief 《巡案與大盜》 was filmed on board a pirate ship in the ocean off Cebu, the Philippines. The cast enjoyed themselves, resulting in a highly watchable opera. Two years later, her God of the River Luo 《洛神》 was filmed on location in Beijing. She had Huang Shi (), a renowned composer from the mainland, write music to be performed by a symphony orchestra. The production was the first Taiwanese opera program to be shown on Taiwanese prime time TV. In addition to television productions, the widely talented Yang also starred in many Taiwanese-language films. One of those, the 1981 film Chen San and Wu Niang 《陳三五娘》, was the last such Taiwanese-language production. Live performances Yang's acting and singing cast the same magic spell over a live audience. In addition to making Taiwanese opera more elaborate and modernized, Yang also aimed to turn what was often thought of as a vulgar art form into high art. In the past, Taiwanese opera was deemed “common”- not appealing to refined tastes. No one ever dreamed of a performance in a grand theatre. Then in 1981, Yang's group was invited to perform in Taipei's stately Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, and Yang chose her favourite drama, The Fisherwoman 《漁孃》 as the presentation, with assistance from students of the Haikuang Opera School. The appreciative audience packed the giant auditorium and the show received rave reviews. The status of Taiwanese opera had substantially elevated. And the next year, the Taiwan Provincial Government invited Yang to tour across the island and stage traditional folk theater for fishermen, miners, and salt workers in villages around the island.\\"When you first arrive in a village, you can't even see a sign of human beings, but on the night of the performance, they emerge in throngs. I can't imagine where they come from. I love the live stage - much better than TV. You can breathe with the audience. Your special reward is the audience's immediate response, its joy and sorrow,\\" she said. In 1991, her production of Lu Bu and Diao Chan 《呂布與貂嬋》 held at the National Theater caused a sensation. In 1995, during a four-day engagement (October 25–28) at Taipei's National Theater, Yang reached back 30 years to restage a traditional opera that she had not appeared. The Taiwanese opera Lu Wen-long 《陸文龍》 in which Yang made her debut when she was 17 years old, owns a special place in her heart. The play, a story about a young warrior who grapples with feelings of love, hate, and clan loyalty during the Sung Dynasty (960-1279), dazzled the Taipei audiences with demonstrations of martial arts. But it also had a tender side, that being the bittersweet romance between Lu and Yehlu. The versatile Yang excels in both areas; she can play it hard or soft. In the beginning of \\"Lu Wen-lung,\\" Yang skillfully wields two spears in a rhythmic combat dance considered one of the most difficult martial art scenes in Taiwanese opera. To ensure a perfect scene, the actress said she practised with the spears three hours a day for an entire month. In the past, audiences of traditional Taiwanese opera wanted to see as many martial art scenes as possible, even if the physical feats on stage had nothing to do with the plot. For the Taipei performances, however, Yang toned down the combat scenes to give the story a more intellectual appeal. In 2000, Yang and her troupe performed Liang-Zhu 《梁祝》, a Chinese love story famous for its romantic yet tragic ending. Separated because of their feuding families, the hero Liang Shan-po dies of lovesickness and the heroine Zhu Ying-tai commits suicide. Both then become butterflies. The traditional story has been adapted for the screen, radio and television. \\"This is one of the earliest and most traditional plays in the repertoire of Taiwanese opera,\\" Yang said at a press conference in Taipei. Yang's six-day engagement attracted people from all walks of life. Tickets for the shows were purchased months in advance. In one scene of Liang-Zhu 《梁祝》, Yang as the male lead has to carry the heroine on her back for several minutes. Yang said she is physically comfortable with this, as she has performed the scene many times during her long career. Yang's excellent students Chen Ya-lan () and Ji Li-ru () played the other two important characters in the play. Both Chen and Ji have been in the Taiwanese opera circles for more than 20 years. Chen is also a popular actress, singer and hostess on television and has been known as Yang's successor. In 2007, having been absent from the limelight for four years, Yang has been asked to return to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the opening of the National Theater by performing new versions of the operas A Civet for a Prince 《狸貓換太子》 and A Life for the Master 《丹心救主》. She's risen to the occasion, too-not only has she reworked the songs for the opera and newly choreographed the works in collaboration with experienced performer Hsiao Feng-hsien() and Peking Opera director Chu Lu-hao(), she has also taken on the challenge of playing three different parts. As well as playing the Song Dynasty emperor Renzong(), who was traded for a raccoon as a child and who as an adult sought out his birth mother from among the commoners, she also played a loyal minister and the commoner who looked after the emperor's birth mother. Though she had not performed for years, Yang used all the skills she's acquired over a lifetime. In just two and half hours, she went through three different ages, personalities, and personal backgrounds. She played a young male character, an old male character, and a clown-it has been the greatest challenge she has faced in her half a century of performing. Marriage In the theatric establishment, an iota of stigma is magnified into a world of scandal. But Yang, scrupulous in behavior, has never been involved. Ending an 8-years love marathon, Yang married Hung Wen-tung on 26 March 1983. The marriage drew thousands of uninvited fans to the Grand Hotel. Had the bride, Yang Li-hua not been wearing her wedding gown, the scene could easily have been mistaken for another performance of Taiwanese opera, except Yang, this time was not playing the leading \\"male\\" role. Spiffily-dressed middle-aged housewives and nimble school girls squeezed in and out of the crowd, trying desperately to get a clear look at the bride. Some women even put their children on their shoulders so that at least the younger generation could get a good look at the couple. The wedding master had to plead with the crowd to allow the newlyweds to make their way through the immense tidal wave of people. Though somewhat disturbed by the impassioned attendance of so many uninvited guests, Yang laughed it away. After all, her name has been a byword with local audiences for 20 years, and she is aware that she is the symbol of the chivalrous spirit of China-past to the citizens of today. A year after her marriage, she toured the United States, Japan and the Philippines to entertain overseas Chinese under arrangements by the Government Information Office. Legacy Many scholars who studied drama said that Taiwanese opera would have died out several decades ago had it not been for Yang's efforts. While this may be a bit of an exaggeration, her prestige is indeed unprecedented. In 1982, under arrangements made by the Taiwan Provincial Government, Yang led a touring troupe around Taiwan to provide encouragement to fishermen and miners. Many of her fans went to see and support her, thereby attaching more importance and significance to Taiwanese opera. Yang's performances have won acclaim both at home and abroad. *1967:National Theatre Contest Winner of Best Actor *1978:Columbia International Film Festival Award for the Most Popular Film *1985:Excellent TV Theatre Show --The Flirting Scholar 《風流才子唐伯虎》 *1988:The Golden Bell Award for Traditional Theatre~The Best Soap Opera -- Wang Wenying & Bamboo Reed Horse 《王文英與竹蘆馬》 *1991:New York American Chinese Arts Association Award for Outstanding Asian Art Performer *1993:The Golden Bell Award for Special Contribution-for her lifetime contribution to the development of Taiwanese opera *1995:Taipei City Award for Folk Art Performer *1996:Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission's Huaguang Medal *1998:Elected One of Taiwan's 50 Most Influential People in the Past 400 Years by Common Wealth Magazine Huangmei opera Yang starred in the 1982 Huangmei opera film Imperial Matchmaker () directed by Pao Hsueh-li, alongside Ivy Ling Po. Retirement In the 1990s, cable television became widespread in Taiwan and the original three broadcast networks lost their dominance. And though the tradition-minded Yang tried twice to develop a new generation of performers who could take up the mantle, she could not find anyone who could fill her role. At the same time, TTV was making moves to take back the rights to the television show against Yang's will. This put a damper on their working relationship, and the Taiwan Television Yang Li-hua Opera show came to an end. Having left the opera world, Yang was lucky to have the loving environment of the home she'd made with the renowned orthopedic surgeon Hung Wen-tung. But she has never forgotten the theater. Whenever there is the right script and the right opportunity, she is ready to return to the stage. Whether on stage or not, Yang always speaks in a low, sonorous voice. \\"Taiwanese opera is the treasure of our native culture. As long as the audiences like this traditional art, I will continue performing it,\\" she said.

An APA award in DeLeon's name honors a graduate student who contributes to the advancement of pharmacotherapy in psychology. He was elected to the Institute of Medicine in 2008. He has been named an Honorary Fellow of the American Academy of Nursing. Early life Patrick DeLeon was born on January 6, 1943, in Waterbury, Connecticut. He grew up in Waterbury. As a child, DeLeon struggled academically after sustaining unrecognized hearing loss related to a sulfa antibiotic. Due to his lip-reading ability, he did not realize the extent of his hearing loss until he was in college. DeLeon earned an undergraduate liberal arts degree from Amherst College in 1964. He attended graduate school at Purdue University, completing a PhD in psychology in 1969. After finishing his PhD, DeLeon moved to Hawaii and took a job with the University of Hawaii at Hilo's Peace Corps training program. He worked for the state's mental health division before returning to graduate school. He earned a Master of Public Health (MPH) from the University of Hawaii at Manoa in 1973. Career DeLeon completed a public health internship in Washington, D.C. with Senator Daniel Inouye in 1973. At the time, the senator was on the United States Senate Watergate Committee; DeLeon's internship started on the first day of the Watergate hearings. DeLeon remained on Inouye's staff after the internship. In 1980, DeLeon graduated from Catholic University of America's Columbus School of Law and he remained a staff assistant with Inouye after law school. Inouye and DeLeon supported the creation of the Emergency Medical Services for Children program after DeLeon's daughter became critically ill with meningitis in 1984. Though his daughter survived, DeLeon learned that the average hospital emergency room was not equipped to deal with seriously ill infants or their families. DeLeon has held numerous roles within the American Psychological Association (APA). In 1987, he was president of the Society of Clinical Psychology, APA's Division 12. DeLeon was editor of Professional Psychology: Research and Practice from 1995 to 2000. He served as APA president in 2000. He is the editor of Psychological Services, a consulting editor for Professional Psychology: Research and Practice and a contributing editor for Psychotherapy Bulletin. He is a Fellow of the American Society for the Advancement of Pharmacotherapy, APA's Division 55. DeLeon has been an advocate for the prescriptive authority for psychologists movement. While he served on the APA Board of Directors, DeLeon and Inouye were largely responsible for a 1988 legislative measure that authorized psychopharmacology training for United States Department of Defense psychologists. Around the same time, he worked to secure prescriptive privileges for nurse practitioners. According to Inouye, DeLeon also played major roles in the development of the schools of pharmacy and nursing at the University of Hawaii at Hilo. In 2011, DeLeon retired as Inouye's chief of staff after more than 38 years of service with the senator. As of 2012, DeLeon held a distinguished professorship in health policy and research at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. He has been an adjunct faculty member at Vanderbilt University, Widener University and the University of Hawaii campuses in Hilo and Manoa. Honors and awards In 2008, DeLeon was designated a member of the Institute of Medicine. He was recognized the next year with the APA Award for Lifetime Contributions to Psychology, the organization's highest award. He won the inaugural Advocacy Award from the National Council of Schools and Programs of Professional Psychology in 2004. DeLeon is also an Honorary Fellow of the American Academy of Nursing. He is the recipient of honorary doctorates from Nova Southeastern University, the Forest Institute and the California School of Professional Psychology. The Patrick H. DeLeon Prize was established by Division 55 of the APA to honor a graduate student who makes significant contributions to advance pharmacotherapy in psychology.

This was the first model with non-trivial identity types, i.e. other than sets. Based on this work other models with non-trivial identity types were studied, including homotopy type theory which has been proposed as a foundation for mathematics in Vladimir Voevodsky's research program Univalent Foundations of Mathematics.

Established in 1919 by King George V, the medal was initially created to reward members of the Special Constabulary for their service during World War I. History Established on 30 August 1919 by Royal Warrant, the medal was initially known as the Special Constabulary Medal. The intent of the original warrant was to recognise the service of the members of the Special Constabulary during World War I, with further regulations to recognise nine years of service as a member of the Special Constabulary. A new Royal Warrant was promulgated in 1920 changing the name of the medal to the Special Constabulary Long Service Medal. In 1929, subsequent awards could be recognised by a clasp inscribed Long Service. The Special Constabulary Long Service Medal was also awarded to members of the British South Africa Police Reserve for service in Southern Rhodesia after 1939, with recommendations made by the Governor of Southern Rhodesia to the Dominions Office in London. By 1965, when the last awards were made, a total of 559 medals, 71 first clasps and six second clasps had been received by members of the Reserve.Robert Brewster.

Criteria The Special Constabulary Long Service Medal may be awarded under one of four different sets of criteria: =Great War service= Special Constables who served during World War I from 1914-1918 for three years, and performed at least 150 police duties were eligible to be awarded the medal. Recipients who received the medal under these conditions were entitled to a clasp inscribed The Great War 1914 - 18 to denote their World War I service. =Special Constabulary= The medal may be awarded to Special Constables who are recommended by the Chief Officer of Police of the department in which they serve so long as they have served for at least nine years, and willingly and competently discharged their duty as a Special Constable. Years of service during World War I from 1914 to 1918 and service during World War II from 3 September 1939 to 31 December 1945 are counted as triple. Special Constables who complete an additional period of ten years service are eligible for a clasp to the medal, upon the recommendation of the Chief Officer of Police. =Ulster Special Constabulary= Members of the Ulster Special Constabulary were eligible for award of the medal after fifteen years of service where they willingly and competently discharged their duty. Members who were serving their fifteenth year on 30 April 1970, the date the Ulster Special Constabulary was disbanded, were also eligible for award of the medal. Eligible individuals must have been recommended for award by the Chief Officer of Police, Royal Ulster Constabulary. Special Constables who complete an additional period of ten years service are eligible for a clasp to the medal, upon the recommendation of the Chief Officer of Police. Members of the Ulster Special Constabulary who were in at least the ninth year of a subsequent ten- year period of service on 30 April 1970 were eligible for award of a clasp. =Royal Ulster Constabulary Reserve= The medal may be awarded to members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary Reserve upon the recommendation of the Chief Constable, Royal Ulster Constabulary, who served fifteen years and willingly and competently discharged their duty as a member of the RUC Reserve.

According to public prosecutor Raffaele Guariniello, eight out of ten of Traversa’s quickdraws were assembled this way. Five people have been charged with manslaughter in the case. Among those charged is the owner of the company that produced the rubber keepers without instructions, as well as the owner of the gear shop that sold the keepers.

The main current sources are located under the village of Vikos. Along its path it converges with other water currents originating from the banks of Tymfi or the Vikos Gorge it ends close to Konitsa. The river has a total length of 15 kilometers. The name Voidomatis,(meaning: the eye of the ox), derives from the fact that oxen have clear blue eyes, like the waters of this river. Also, there is the Slavic etymology: Bode–Mat which means \\"good water\\". Voidomatis has been characterized as one of the cleanest rivers in Europe as it does not face any environmental issues. It crosses one of the most beautiful natural locations of Greece and has been part of the Vikos–Aoös National Park since 1973. The river is spanned by a number of stone bridges, the most famous being the Kledonas Bridge. The river is known for water sports such as rafting and kayaking.

Cave Hole is a large cave on the south east side of the Isle of Portland, a large peninsular in Dorset, England. It has a blowhole and a wooden crane, known as Broad Ope Crane on the cliff top. It is north-east of Portland Bill, has an interior measuring square and high. The Blow Hole of Cave Hole. Cave Hole was earlier known as Keeve's Hole and regularly featured in recorded history and wider lore of smuggling. It is made up of a series of caves with steep roof sections, tunnels and ledges, and represents the first stage in cave collapse. The cave and its surrounding area is frequently used for deep-water soloing. The cave's blowhole, which stretches far into the solid rock, was formed when the roof of the cave was broken through to the surface. For the protection of people looking down into the cave, an iron grill has been installed across it. Whenever a powerful easterly gale occurs, the sea shoots up through the fissures. Various small craft have been driven into the cave by east and south easterly gales, the largest of which was a 40-ton vessel from Cowes in 1780. Frank and Ann Davison were shipwrecked at the cave in 1949. The pair had set sail for the West Indies. Frank drowned but Ann managed to scramble ashore. A local tale has long reputed that the cave is home to Roy Dog - a black dog, \\"as high as man, with large fiery eyes, one green, one red\\".

It was sited on elevated ground to the northeast of Furness Abbey. The house was surrounded by extensive grounds with footpaths providing fine views. History The house was designed by the Lancaster architect E. G. Paley, and built between 1857 and 1859 for Sir James Ramsden. Ramsden was an industrialist who played a large part in running the Furness Railway, eventually becoming its managing director, and in the iron and steel and shipbuilding industry in Barrow-in- Furness. The Furness Railway contributed £2,000 (equivalent to £ in ) towards its cost, although Brandwood et al. consider that it must have cost much more. The same authors also suggest that the house was used by the railway as a showpiece, and that clients would have been entertained there. In 1874 Paley's architectural practice drew up plans for an addition to the North Lodge on the estate, and in 1882 plans for a new morning-room for the house, which was built on its southeast corner. After James Ramsden's death in 1896, the house and estate passed to his son, Frederick, who did not marry, and who died in 1941. The house was used by the army during the World War II as can be seen by the presence of disused camp sites within the grounds on later 1950s Ordnance Survey maps, and later a convalescent home. The manor's condition subsequently deteriorated, and it was demolished using dynamite in 1961 by Barrow Corporation. Much of the manor's footings however remain visible giving a clear indication of its original scale. Some of the estate buildings were left standing, including four lodges, the home farm, and cottages, all of which had been designed by the Lancaster practice. Some internal furnishings from the manor made by Gillows of Lancaster and London were transferred to Barrow Town Hall and even the Art Institute of Chicago.Furnishings The grounds of the estate are now maintained as a Country Wildlife Site by the Cumbria Wildlife Trust. Architecture The South Lodge is one of three listed buildings of the Abbot's Wood estate that survives the original mansion Abbot's Wood was a large complex building, incorporating elements of Gothic and Tudor architecture. There were many gables and roofs, a square tower with a taller stair turret and a particularly long conservatory. Of the surviving estate buildings, three are recorded in the National Heritage List for England as designated Grade II listed buildings; two of the lodges and the home farm. The North Lodge, with its attached gatehouse and wing walls, is constructed in sandstone, and is in Gothic Revival style. The gatehouse has two storeys, with an archway in the lower storey. The upper storey contains a niche for a statue, which is flanked by a single-light window on each side. The single-bay gabled lodge to the right has a red tiled roof, and mullioned and transomed windows. The South Lodge is half-timbered on a sandstone plinth, and has a red tiled roof. It is in two storeys, the front being gabled with a decorated bargeboard. The windows are transomed casements, and there is a four-light oriel window on the left side. The Home Farm is built in sandstone with red tiled roofs. It consists of a cottage with a single storey and an attic, a shippon and calf house, a barn, pigsties, a stable, and a cart shed. These are all set in a U-shape around a courtyard.

They became close friends and Pannunzi became the godfather of Miceli's first born. The relation between the Calabrian and the Sicilian mafioso also was very useful for drug trafficking because of their connection in both criminal organisations.

He also traded heroin to the U.S. on behalf of the Mafia bosses from Palermo Stefano Bontade and Salvatore Inzerillo. In 1989, Pannunzi was involved in setting up a heroin lab near Bergamo in northern Italy together with the Barbaro and Sergi 'Ndrangheta clans from Platì. The lab was discovered on May 21, 1990 in a farmhouse Valsecca, while French Connection chemists Alain Mazza and Gilles Pairone were refining 20 kilograms of heroin. Pannunzi was one of the first to understand that there was a lot more money to be made with cocaine, which was rapidly becoming the new drug of choice among the affluent. He set up a very profitable deal, trading 1 kilogram of heroin for 25 kilograms of cocaine in the U.S. using the differences in availability on both markets. As a result of the police dismantling the operation an arrest warrant was issued against Pannunzi for drug trafficking and criminal association. Moving to Colombia Pannunzi started to contact Colombian traffickers in Venezuela, Amsterdam and Madrid. He moved to Colombia where he would become one of the most important cocaine brokers for both the Sicilian Mafia and the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta with the Colombian cocaine cartels. According to the deputy chief prosecutor in Reggio Calabria, Nicola Gratteri, Pannunzi would become \\"the only one who can sell both to the 'Ndrangheta and to Cosa Nostra.

He had unrestricted use of a cellular phone throughout the year he spent in prison in Colombia before his extradition to Italy, and hence was able to continue his business. Pannunzi was extradited to Italy in December 1994, but managed to escape in 1998 taking advantage of a temporary medical release. The next day he was on the run.

He lives in Beijing.http://shenjingdong.com/cv-and-resume/, and https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151590074737472.1073741834.177302032471&type;=1  Life and career  Shen Jingdong was born in 1965 in the town of Nanjing (province of Jiangsu), China. Shen graduated from the Nanjing Xiaozhuang Normal School in 1984 and from the Nanjing Arts Institute in 1991. After many years of studies in Fine art, Shen was conscripted to the Military Drama Troupe of Nanjing Military Area, where he made his career over a span of sixteen years until 2007. In the 2000s, the emergence of Shen JingDong in a period of revival for Chinese Contemporary Art suggested a dawning of a new era. Previously, ideological criticism determined the direction of new contemporary art. Shen JingDong provides a definitive example of commercialised aesthetics in Chinese pop art. While serving as a soldier, he was praised by a Chinese leader for his theatrical background design, in 1998. He attempted various conceptual and performing arts in the 1990s, influenced by Dadaism and pop art. In 2006, ‘Hero No.12‘ was collected in the National Art Museum of China, the Most Famous National Museum of Art in China, and his artistry began to be recognised. His art received numerous praise for its pursuit of “cuteness” along with its commercialized ideological features. Starting in 2007, an exhibitions of his works have been hosted in Hong Kong and New York, and his performances were held in the United States, Italy, the Republic of Korea, Japan, and France. In 2008, his Chinese and international artistic career evolved quickly; Shen become an important contemporary artist of the new wave, with his Hero series. He created into different kinds of people the image of the soldier and of the icons of Chinese life as represented in new forms, sometimes diverted in expressive colors (Blue, Green, Red or Yellow).Shen Jingdong's catalogue - Fragmentary memories p. 9 to 17 Through his work, he reveals his innermost thoughts, hidden in metaphors, humor and smiles. Amid the urbanisation and globalisation going on throughout China, Shen JingDong can be seen in his works as a witness to the changes globalisation brings. Amid the strengthening of ideology and oppression of freedom that coincides with globalisation, his work provides a new way out. Through the harmony of the realm of both imagination and reality, he builds his own fairy tales. * His painting The BugleThe Bugle realized in 2012 illustrates perfectly his work, allowing each observer to have a new look on the contemporary art, but also a reflection and interpretation intellectual, sensitive and emotional. The artworks of Shen can be seen in private and public collections worldwide. One of the most famous collectors of Shen's works is actress Zhang Ziyi.

History  The research for biotechnology in Bangladesh started in the late 1970s. The root cause behind the initiation was the significance of agricultural sector, which had been the backbone of the national economy since the ancient times. The research first started in the department of Genetics and Plant Breeding in Bangladesh Agricultural University through Tissue culture on jute. Subsequently, within the next 10–12 years, similar research programs began to take place in Faculty of Biotechnology & Genetic Engineering at MBSTU, University of Rajshahi, University of Chittagong, University of Khulna, Islamic University, Kushtia, Jagannath University, Jahangirnagar University, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Bangladesh Rice Research Institute, Bangladesh Jute Research Institute, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman science and technology university, Sylhet Agricultural University, Bangabandhu Shiekh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University, Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Bangladesh Forest Research Institute, Bangladesh Institute of Nuclear Agriculture, Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Bangladesh Livestock Research Institute and Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission. In 1990, Bangladesh Association for Plant Tissue Culture (BAPTC) was formed which has been organising several international conferences since its inception. In September 1993, the government of Bangladesh formed a National Committee on Biotechnology Product Development to select potential biotechnological projects which could be leased out for commercialisation. In collaboration with BAPTC, the Ministry of Science and Technology organised a workshop on Biosafety Regulation in 1997, after which a task force was formed to formulate biosafety guidelines and biosafety regulations in the light of the regulation of the workshop. In the late 1990s, Bangladesh became a member of the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB). In 1999, the National Institute of Biotechnology was established as the centre of excellence in biotechnological education. To accelerate multidimensional biotechnological research, in 2006, the government adopted the national policy guidelines on biotechnology which was approved by the National Task force on biotechnology. In 2012, the cabinet approved the draft of National Biotechnology Policy, 2012 which was aimed at eradicating poverty through increasing productivity in agriculture and industrial sectors.  Genome sequencing projects  = Jute genome = In 2008, with the funding of the government, the University of Dhaka, DataSoft IT firm and Bangladesh Jute Research Institute initiated a collaborative genome research program on jute under the leadership of Dr. Maqsudul Alam who had previously sequenced the genomes of papaya and rubber. Subsequently, in 2010, the group of scientists successfully sequenced the genome of jute, through which, Bangladesh became only the second country after Malaysia, among the developing nations, to have successfully sequenced a plant genome. = Fungus genome = In 2012, the same group of scientists decoded the genome of Macrophomina phaseolina, a Botryosphaeriaceae fungus, which is responsible for causing seedling blight, root rot, and charcoal rot of more than 500 crop and non-crop species throughout the world. The sequencing took place at the laboratory of Bangladesh Jute Research Institute and was done as part of The Basic and applied Research on Jute project.  Biotechnology industry  Biotechnology industry is yet to be a major contributor on the national economy, however, according to the experts, the results of some ongoing research shows enough potentials of this sector. BCSIR has undertaken the production of Spirulina and a certain quantity of it is being marketed as tablets by several private manufacturers. BCSIR has also explored the production of baker's yeast using molasses which are by-products of the sugarcane manufacturing plants in the northern part of the country. The net production of molasses numbers about 100,000 million tons per year, about half of which is used in the distilleries for the production of ethanol. The production of Rhizobium is also perceived to have commercial potential. Several private pharmaceutical companies have started to develop separate and dedicated biotech units. Some private firms like BRAC Biotechnology Center, Square Agric-tech and Aman Agro Industries are producing virus-free potato seeds in substantial quantities, gradually reducing the dependency on imported potato seeds. Proshika Tissue Culture Center is now exporting varieties of tissue culture derived orchid plants. Pharmaceutical companies like the Incepta Pharmaceuticals have begun to produce and market insulin and preparing to export abroad. Incepta has also signed an agreement with ICGEB to receive the technological know-how for commercially manufacturing hepatitis B vaccine.

He was born in Montreal, Quebec, and later lived in Southern California, Central California, and Saudi Arabia. He attended UCLA and Iowa Writers' Workshop. He currently lives in Los Angeles, where he is a contributing editor of the Brooklyn-based literary magazine A Public Space. His debut novel The Interloper, published by Other Press in 2007, grapples with themes of family, crime, and revenge through the lens of an unreliable narrator. Wilson has said that the novel was partly inspired by the murder of his older brother when Wilson was seven years old. The Interloper was a finalist for the Foreword Book of the Year and was named a Book of the Decade by The L Magazine. His second novel, Panorama City, was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in 2012. It spent seven weeks on the Los Angeles Times Bestseller list and was widely reviewed. In The New York Times Book Review, Adam Ross noted a shift in Wilson's focus: \\"If The Interloper was about lighting the way to hell, to paraphrase Milton, here the author's gaze is directed heavenward, toward sanity and the good in all of us. Panorama City is about our struggle to remain open to one another in a world that categorizes and closes us off at every turn.\\" Panorama City was named a Best Book of 2012 by The San Francisco Chronicle and an editors' choice by The New York Times Book Review. Panorama City was a finalist for the Southern California Independent Booksellers Association Award in 2013. In 2017, Panorama City won the inaugural San Fernando Valley Award for Fiction from the Friends of the Oviatt Library at California State University, Northridge. In Germany, Panorama City was released as Ein Mann Von Welt.

When spring comes, he travels by cart to various New England towns, charging people $3 to $5 to have the blank faces filled in with their likenesses. The simple plot is essentially a series of vignettes. Jude saves a young woman from making a disastrous marriage to an older man by creating a portrait as if she had drowned herself — as did the old man's previous wife. Jude flirts with a sexy tavern mistress whose face just happens to fit the Rubens-style nude painting that he seldom shows to anyone. The most dramatic moment occurs when a sheriff mistakenly arrests him in the mistaken belief that he is an infamous highwayman. Rainbow on the Road's chief rewards are in the portrayal of local types and their colorful phrases (\\"She was plump as a little pig. active as sin, awkward as a calf, and not much more legs on her than a pigeon\\"). The evocations of New England during the four seasons are memorable, as in the book's late-autumn ending: \\"Crows were out gleaning, looking like blown bits of charred paper. And talking all the time — like crows talk. Far above, the lonely hawk floating. Harvest is over. It is the lone-somest time of the year.\\" The novel (published by Houghton Mifflin, and now out of print) forms the basis of the 1969 Broadway musical, Come Summer.

Geography Kogajajima is located east- southeast from Gajajima. It is the partial exposed portion of an eroded lava dome of a stratovolcano arising from the ocean floor, to a maximum height of above sea level. No volcanic activity has been recorded in historic times. The local climate is classified as subtropical, with a rainy season from May through September. History Kogajajima does not appear to have ever had permanent human habitation. During the Edo period, Kogajajima was part of Satsuma Domain and was administered as part of Kawabe District. In 1896, the island was transferred to the administrative control of Ōshima District, Kagoshima, and from 1911 was administered as part of the village of Toshima, Kagoshima. From 1946 to 1952, the island was administered by the United States as part of the Provisional Government of Northern Ryukyu Islands.

The low-lying, and heavily forested (Sitka spruce) group, named after its largest island, Lucy Island, constitutes a provincially protected conservancy area that contains some of the North Coast’s oldest archeological sites, a nationally significant seabird population, and a prominent 20th-century lighthouse. Location The Lucy Islands Conservancy is an archipelago located about 15 km west of the North Coast’s largest city, the port of Prince Rupert. The archipelago lies in the middle of Chatham Sound, north of the juncture with Hecate Strait, and between the much-larger Melville Island and Digby Island. Naming The islands were named by Captain George Henry Richards of circa 1862 to honour Lucy McNeill, daughter of Hudson’s Bay Company official William Henry McNeill and his first wife, Mathilda, a Kaigani Haida chief. Lucy was a \\"miraculously unfettered Victorian female\\", according to B.C. memoirist Helen Meilleur. \\"She was so adaptable that she could occupy the VIP cabin aboard the Labouchere ... and then set off in a canoe for weeks of weather-exposed travel to Indian villages.\\" She married Hamilton Moffatt of the Hudson's Bay Company and resided in Victoria as of 1906. Human habitation Ancient shell middens and house depressions on the islands are an indicator of human occupation dating back possibly 6,000 years. Some of the oldest archaeological sites on the North Coast are located on the islands, including the earliest-known use of a rectangular house in the region. Traditionally, the Lucy Islands are included in the territory of the Gitwilgyoots, a Tsimshian-speaking tribe that wintered in the Prince Rupert area at the time of European contact. In late spring, during the seasonal round, the Gitwilgyoots moved to the outer islands west of Prince Rupert for a period of marine fishing, shellfish gathering and sea mammal hunting before returning to the Skeena River in early summer for the salmon runs. In the winter of 1984/5, strong winds felled two trees above a shell midden and exposed ancient human remains of a child, a young adult female and an older male. With the approval of the Metlakatla First Nation, the remains were analysed by the Canadian Museum of Civilization. A genetic study published in PLOS ONE in 2013 linked the 5,500-year-old female remains to 2,500-year-old remains found on nearby Dodge Island. The groundbreaking study, the first to use new techniques to analyse the complete mitochondrial genome, also found that a living Tsimshian woman from the Metlakatla First Nation near Prince Rupert had a matrilineal DNA link to the 5,500-year-old female remains from the Lucy Islands. The study’s findings may indicate an enduring occupation of the geographical region by local First Nations. By the 20th century, the sole residents of the Lucy Islands were lighthouse keepers. The original light above their residence was replaced by a tower built in 1907 on the east point of the main island. The Canadian Coast Guard destaffed the lighthouse in 1988. Protected area In 2008, the provincial government established the new Lucy Islands Conservancy under the Protected Areas of British Columbia Act. It protects critical seabird nesting habitat and supports contemporary marine food harvesting as well as popular recreation opportunities. The conservancy protects the 28 hectares of land throughout the archipelago as well as 178 hectares of foreshore out to 200 metres from the natural boundary of the sea. The conservancy is collaboratively managed by BC Parks with the Metlakatla and Lax Kw’alaams First Nations. The partnership replaced a rotten and hazardous boardwalk to permit recreational visits while protecting archaeological and bird-nesting features. Seabirds The islands are home to a significant avian population and were cited by the Metlakatla Governing Council as an area of concern in their Joint Review Panel submission that opposed the proposed Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines project. The conservancy is a nationally significant breeding site for rhinoceros auklets, that dig long burrows where they make their nests. Lucy Islands is the sixth-largest colony in the province. The 25,300 nesting pairs (1983) also represent about 5.4% of the global population. In 1983, as many as 197 pigeon guillemots (or 1.9% of the estimated national population) were recorded among the islands. By the following year, just 54 pigeon guillemots were recorded. glaucous-winged gulls and black oystercatchers have also been recorded at the site.

Carretto was born in Finale Ligure in Liguria in 1455, the fourth child of Giovanni del Carretto, Marquis of Finale, and of his wife, Valentina Adorno, daughter of Barnaba Adorno, Doge of Genoa. His older brother was Cardinal Carlo Domenico del Carretto.Louis-François de Villeneuve-Bargemont, Monumens des grands- maitres de l'ordre de Saint Jean de Jérusalem ou vues des tombeaux élevés à Jérusalem, à Ptolémais, à Rhodes, à Malte, etc., accompagnés de notices historiques sur chacun des grands-maitres (Paris: J.

Having entered the Knights Hospitaller at a young age, Carretto spent some years in Rhodes but in 1491 he returned to Italy, where he obtained from Pope Innocent VIII the commandry of Santa Maria of the Temple of the Holy Cross in Milan. An able organizer, Carretto was repeatedly instructed by the Order to set up galleys and ships in Genoa to be used in the defence of Rhodes, and in 1500 he was appointed captain of the galleys. However, in 1502 he settled in Rome because the Grand Master made him Procurator General of the Order to the Holy See. In 1505 he became bailiff of St. Euphemia. In 1509 he became Admiral of the Order and, consequently, head of the Italian Langue. He was entrusted with important tasks by Pope Julius II, whom he accompanied to the Fifth Council of the Lateran in 1512.Villeneuve-Bargemont, t. 1, p. 241 and 244. He then returned to Rhodes, where he conducted two ships in the service of the Order. On November 24, 1513, Grand Master Guy de Blanchefort died near the island of Zakynthos, but the news did not reach Rhodes until December 13. Two days later on December 15 Carretto was elected Grand Master.Villeneuve-Bargemont, t. 1, p. 243. In the seven years of his government he strengthened the defenses of the city of Rhodes and the other islands of the Dodecanese, providing the fortresses with abundant food supplies and artillery. Carretto died in Rhodes, after a short illness, on January 10, 1521. He was the last Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller to die in Rhodes.

For a long time it was customary for them to dress in short white hose and a waistcoat in the Spanish style. In earlier times they were armed with a halberd and a dagger. Later they were also used as cavalry.Brockhaus Bilder- Conversations-Lexikon The trabant guards frequently formed the core of Household Divisions or, as in Brandenburg, field troops as well. The Gardes du Corps were formed from the 2 companies of trabants serving Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, who fought with him in 1675 at the Battle of Fehrbellin. In the order of battle in 1682 for the newly created Royal Saxon Army there were 172 horses listed in the Trabant Horse Guards (Trabanten- Leibgarde zu Roß) as well as 65 men in the Trabant Foot Guards (Leibgarde der Fuß-Trabanten).Larraß S. 1/2 In 1701, the Saxon Gardes du Corps was formed out of the Saxon trabants. This Saxon regiment met its end in the 1812 French invasion of Russia under Napoleon. In the endless march on Moscow and the subsequent retreat, almost all the trabants lost their lives.

From an early age, he and his family moved to Caracas, where he lived in the popular area of Los Jardines del Valle, but always kept a close connection with his native hometown. He earned a Bachelor of Arts from the Central University of Venezuela with a thesis on poetry groups \\"Traffic\\" and \\"Guaire\\". Later he earned a Ph.D. in Hispanic American Literature from the University of Salamanca with a thesis on the Venezuelan writer José Balza. He has published fifteen books including novels, volumes of short stories and essays. He lives in Spain, country where he has written and published most of his work. His work has been part of several anthologies in Spanish as Líneas aéreas and Pequeñas resistencias and some of his stories have been published in Switzerland, France, Bulgaria, Italy, Slovenia and the United States. In Venezuela, his texts are part of two recent short story anthologies: Las voces secretas, published by Alfaguara, and 21 del XXI, that was commercially released by Ediciones B. He has been invited to several important international literary events such as the International Guadalajara Book Fair, the Fair of Santiago de Chile, the Madrid eñe Festival, and has lectured at universities and institutions in Algeria, Colombia, Croatia, Spain, France, Switzerland, Venezuela, etc. In April 2013 his novel Arena Negra was awarded Book of the Year by booksellers in Venezuela.  Work  Topics such as the uprooting of exiles, travel, love, sentimentality, are part of the narrative interests of Méndez Guédez, a work characterized by multiple records that are moved from the use of orality, to the development of sound prose, embedded with a deep lyricism. Méndez Guédez's work has been placed by many literary scholars — such as Chiara Bolognese (Autonomous University of Madrid), Fabiola Fernandez (Andrés Bello Catholic University), Vega Sánchez (University of Salamanca), or Maartje Vranken (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven) — in the orbit of the Spanish-American romantic and sentimental narrative. A line of writing that comes from authors like Manuel Puig or Alfredo Bryce Echenique, in which the humor, relationships with popular culture, and the emphasis on the emotional dramas of male characterized by their fragility, define the general discourse of its narrative. But, as the writer Ignacio Sanz argues, in Méndez Guédez one sees a sense of dual belonging, on one side to the Peninsular Spanish cultural register and, on the other, to the Hispanic American worldview, which is evident in the construction of his prose style, full of winks and lexical features that constitute a sort of mestizo language in itself.Sanz, Ignacio. \\"A Review of Hasta Luego, Míster Salinger.\\" In La tormenta en un vaso. Personal Blog. 20 March 2008. This circumstance of intense attachment to two countries — two realities — places Méndez Guédez in a particular creative line of 21st-century Spanish language fiction that also involves authors such as Fernando Iwasaki, Jorge Eduardo Benavides, Juan Gabriel Vasquez, Andrés Neuman, etc.; writers whose fictions embodies a nostalgic look at the place of origin, combined with a critical outlook of the place of residence, all which confers their narratives with an expressive mixture of universal character. As stated by critic Marco Kunz (University of Lausanne): \\"The migrant narrative of Méndez Guédez demonstrates the possibility of a new Latin American literature that is not enclosed in the obliguismo that explores the hallmarks of local, regional or national, nor chooses a staunch internationalism \\".Kunz, Marco. \\"Barquisimeto global. La narrativa migrante de Juan Carlos Méndez Guédez.\\" ALEPH 25 (2012): pp. 35-44. Notably, Méndez Guédez is one of the authors who started fictionalizing the immigration of 21st-century Spain with his novel Una tarde con campanas, published in 2004. A topic that has been followed up by authors such as Joseph Shepherd, Carmen Jiménez, Pablo Aranda, Donato Ndongo, Najat El Hachmi, James Roncagliolo and Angels Case, among others. In a way, his books incorporate into its narrative a sense of both the spatial and cultural diversity that is characteristic of his country, together with that of the Iberian Peninsula and the Canary Islands, as to conform a larger and richer fictional universe. This element, according to German critic Burkhard Pohl,Pohl, Burkhard. \\"Estrategias transnacionales en el mercado del libro, (1990–2010).\\" ALEPH 25 (2012): pp. 13-34. constitutes a feature of a certain segment of the current Latin American narrative, in which the style of authors such as Méndez Guédez and Jorge Volpi serve as a parody of the exchange between different realities, highlighting the absurd literary notion that attached preconceived worldviews to certain writers from different regions of the planet. Méndez Guédez is considered by many a renovator of the romantic tradition in Latin American narrative.Merino, José M. \\"A Review of Ideogramas by Juan Carlos Méndez Guédez.\\" Revista Leer (Dec. 2013): p. 79. Some of Méndez Guédez's works also have stylistic features that go back to the English comic novel — such as certain strain of vulgar eroticism — but that nonetheless remain within the influence of more contemporary and experimental trends in story construction — all that is without forgetting the passion for the power of anecdote and the seduction of the reader, and exploring expressive tools that break with classical linearity. Thus, each of Méndez Guédez texts can be a literary universe in itself; one that answers common themes but that is also able to expose a diverse scriptural development.

EQ is based on a definition of empathy that includes cognition and affect. According to the authors of the measure, empathy is a combination of the ability to feel an appropriate emotion in response to another's emotion and the ability to understand the others' emotion (associated with the theory of mind). EQ was developed in response to what the authors considered to be a lack of questionnaires which measure empathy exclusively: other measures such as the questionnaire measure of emotional empathy and the empathy scale have multiple factors which are uncorrelated with empathy, often associated with social skills or the ability to be emotionally aroused in general.Baron Cohen, S., & Wheelwright, S. (2004). The empathy quotient: An investigation of adults with Asperger syndrome or high functioning autism, and normal sex differences. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 34(2), 163–175. doi:10.1023/B:JADD.0000022607.19833.00 EQ was designed to test the empathizing–systemizing theory, a theory which places individuals in different brain-type categories based on their tendencies toward empathy and system creation, and was intended especially for clinical use to determine the role of lack of empathy in psychopathology, in particular to screen for autism spectrum disorder. Format and scoring The EQ consists of 60 items, 40 items relating to empathy and 20 control items. A 40-item version of the test containing only the relevant questions is also available, but may be less reliable in certain applications. Each item is a first-person statement which the administree must rate as either \\"strongly agree\\", \\"slightly agree\\", \\"slightly disagree\\", or \\"strongly disagree\\". All questions must be answered. The instrument is scored on a scale of 0 (being the least empathetic possible) to 80 (being the most empathetic possible). A useful cut-off of 30 was established when screening for autism spectrum disorders. Development of the measure Together with the systematizing quotient, the empathy quotient was developed by Simon Baron-Cohen and is used to test his empathizing-systemizing (E-S) theory of autism. This cognitive theory attempts to account for two different aspects of autism disorder: the social and communication barriers and the narrow interest and attention to detail. Baron-Cohen associated the social and communication barriers with a lack of empathy, not only a lack of theory of mind but also an inability to respond to others' thoughts and emotions. He associated the narrow interest and attention to detail with a special ability to systematize or analyze.Baron-Cohen, S., Richler, J., Bisarya, D., Gurunathan, N., & Wheelwright, S. (2003). The systemizing quotient: An investigation of adults with asperger syndrome or high–functioning autism, and normal sex differences. The Royal Society, 358(1430), 361–374. doi:10.1098/rstb.2002.1206 This theory is consistent with the findings that individuals with autism score significantly higher scores on the systemizing quotient and lower scores on the empathizing quotient than the general population.Wheelwright, S., Baron Cohen, S., Goldenfeld, N., Delaney, J., Fine, D., Smith, R., . . . Wakabayashi, A. (2006). Predicting autism spectrum quotient (AQ) from the systemizing quotient-revised (SQ-R) and empathy quotient (EQ). Brain Research, 1079(1), 47–56. doi:10.1016/j.brainres.2006.01.012 Although these scores have been found consistently, there is controversy about whether the autistic brain differs qualitatively or quantitatively. The E-S theory is also associated with a theory of autism called the extreme male brain theory. The extreme male brain theory is based on the finding that males score significantly higher on the systemizing quotient and lower on the empathy quotient than females in both adult and child populations.,Auyeung, B., Wheelwright, S., Allison, C., Atkinson, M., Samarawickrema, N., & Baron Cohen, S. (2009). The Children’s empathy quotient and systemizing quotient: Sex differences in typical development and in autism spectrum conditions. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 39(11), 1509–1521. doi:10.1007/s10803-009-0772-x and that scores of the autistic population were also higher on systemizing and lower on empathizing but to an extreme. Baron-Cohen hypothesized that the tendencies of autistic scores to be similar to male scores might imply that the autistic brain is more like the male than the female brain in general, and that this might be due to prenatal testosterone. This is one hypothesis that accounts for the sex difference in the prevalence of autism (male-female ratio: 4:1 for autism, 10.8:1 for Asperger syndrome). The extreme male brain theory has led to some controversy, and tests of the hypothesis had mixed findings on the correlation between biological indicators of prenatal testosterone and scores on the systemizing quotient and empathy quotient. Chapman et al. found that male children who had been exposed to more prenatal testosterone scored lower on the EQ, indicating that there is not only a sex difference in empathy but also a difference within the male population which is correlated with prenatal testosterone.Chapman, E., Baron Cohen, S., Auyeung, B., Knickmeyer, R., Taylor, K., & Hackett, G. (2006). Fetal testosterone and empathy: Evidence from the empathy quotient (EQ) and the “Reading the mind in the eyes” test. Social Neuroscience, 1(2), 135–148. doi:10.1080/17470910600992239 There is also evidence against this theory. For example, one possible biomarker for prenatal testosterone's effect on the brain is a low ratio of the second to fourth finger (the 2D:4D ratio), which has been found to be associated with several male specific psychological factors. A significantly lower 2D:4D ratio than the general population has been found in autistic individuals, however there was no correlation between the empathizing and systemizing quotients and the 2D:4D ratio. The authors give many possible explanations for this finding which are contrary to the extreme male brain theory of autism, for example it is possible that the psychometric properties of the quotients are lacking or that the theory itself is incorrect and the difference in autistic brains is not an extreme of normal functioning but of a different structure altogether.Voracek, M., & Dressler, S. (2006). Lack of correlation between digit ratio (2D:4D) and baron-Cohen’s “Reading the mind in the eyes” test, empathy, systemising, and autism-spectrum quotients in a general population sample. Personality and Individual Differences, 41(8), 1481–1491. doi:10.1016/j.paid.2006.06.009 Psychometric properties There is evidence for the face validity of the EQ from the method by which the measure was created. In initial testing, the EQ was examined by a panel of six experimental psychologists, who were asked to rate the match of the items in the measure to the following definition of empathy: \\"Empathy is the drive or ability to attribute mental states to another person/animal, and entails an appropriate affective response in the observer to the other person’s mental state.\\"Baron Cohen, S., & Wheelwright, S. (2004). The empathy quotient: An investigation of adults with Asperger syndrome or high functioning autism, and normal sex differences. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 34(2), 163–175, pg. 168. doi:10.1023/B:JADD.0000022607.19833.00 This definition is based on Baron- Cohen's theory of empathy which includes both a cognitive and affective response to another individual's emotions. Each of the 40 empathy items were rated as relating to the definition of empathy, while all 20 control items were rated as not related, by at least 5 out of 6 experimenters. The EQ has also demonstrated several kinds of reliability. Lawrence et al. found strong inter-rater reliability and test-retest reliability for the EQ. They also found that the EQ has a moderate correlation with the 'empathetic concern’ and ‘perspective taking’ sub-scales of the Interpersonal Reactivity IndexShaw, P., Baker, D., Baron Cohen, S., Lawrence, E. J., & David, A. S. (2004). Measuring empathy: Reliability and validity of the empathy quotient. Psychological Medicine, 34(5), 911–919. doi:10.1017/S0033291703001624 This is another measure of empathy which the authors of the EQ considered to be the best empathy measure before creating their own, but which includes sub-scales which measure more than empathy. This indicates that the EQ has concurrent validity. There has been concern that social desirability might influence EQ score because certain items correlate with the social desirability scale. It is suggested that these items either be dropped or that social desirability be measured in conjunction with the EQ. The authors of this study also suggest that the EQ be revised to include only 28 items divided into three separate categories of empathy including 'cognitive empathy, emotional reactivity and social skills.' There has also been some doubts about the validity and reliability of the EQ. As stated above, one study found a lack of correlation between the EQ and the 2D:4D ratio which is the ratio between the second and fourth fingers determined by prenatal testosterone and estrogen. The ratio is associated with sex differences in several psychological factors. According to the extreme male brain theory of autism, should be a correlation, but there is not. The authors hypothesize that this could be due either to biological factors, a theoretical problem with the E-S theory of autism, or could be due to problems with the psychometric properties of the measures. This study did not directly measure the psychometric properties of the empathy quotient, but indicates that there may be an issue either with the E-S theory or with the measure itself. Revised questionnaires Based on the findings about the psychometric properties of the EQ, there is evidence for the division of the EQ into three sub-categories (the three-factor model): cognitive empathy, emotional reactivity, and social skills. The original authors had not created these divisions because they considered it impossible to separate the cognitive from the emotional aspects of empathy. Based on an analysis of the internal consistency of the scale, a team which included the original authors found that the original questionnaire contained some irrelevant questions and produced a shortened version of the scale containing 28 items. Principal component analysis indicated that this shortened questionnaire was able to measure empathy reliably.Wakabayashi, A., Baron Cohen, S., Wheelwright, S., Goldenfeld, N., Delaney, J., Fine, D., . . .

Personality and Individual Differences, 41(5), 929–940. doi:10.1016/j.paid.2006.03.017 The EQ has been translated into several languages including Serbian, Russian and Dutch. The reliability of the Serbian 40-question scale was lower than the English version, and the original theory that empathy is a one-factor concept was not confirmed. The translation of the shortened 28-question version had higher reliability and there was evidence for the three-factor understanding of empathy.Dimitrijevic, A., Hanak, N., Vukosavljevic Gvozden, T., & Opacic, G. (2012). Psychometric properties of the Serbian version of the empathy quotient (S-EQ).Psihologija, 45(3), 257–276. doi:10.2298/PSI1203257D The Russian study also confirmed the three-factor model.Kosonogov V. (2014). The psychometric properties of the Russian version of the Empathy Quotient. Psychology in Russia: State of the Art, 7(1), 96-104. A study of the Dutch version also confirmed the three-factor model, and indicated good cross-cultural validity in Europe and the US, but less so in Asia.Groen, Y., Fuermaier, A. B. M., Den Heijer, A.

The site was submitted as a possible UNESCO site by the Permanent Delegation of Albania to UNESCO on 5 September 2011, and has been placed on the tentative list. It has come under criteria II, IV, VII and IX.  History  Floor mosaics in the Byzantine Church of Lin. Pogradec and the surrounding area on the shores of Lake Ohrid was first settled by Illyrians in the 5th century BC. Archaeological findings show an Illyrian settlement on a hill located north-west of Pogradec, which was fortified in the 4th century BC. By the 3rd century BC, Roman forces had taken control of Pogradec. The road Via Egnatia is found in the Pogradec region, near to the shores of Lake Ohrid, and is evidence of the former Roman presence. As time passed, the inhabitants of Pogradec became known as Arbër rather than Illyrians, and were eventually referred to as Albanians. The fortification of the city remained intact for a long time, and were only overcome 1400 years after their construction by the Illyrians, by the Slavs. During the Slavic invasion between the 7th and 8th centuries AD, Slavs occupied much of the Balkans, including the Pogradec area. Afterwards the Byzantines were able slowly to regain the imperial control. The Bulgarians then entered Albania, capturing the Pogradec area in the 9th century and sustained the occupation until the 12th century. During these periods of occupation, life behind the fortified walls on the hill was abandoned, and instead a new settlement was created closer to Lake Ohrid, which is modern day Pogradec. The name of the city comes from Slavic languages which once had occupied the area; the name Podga Grada, which evolved to the modern day name, means \\"under the city\\". This is a reference to the former Illyrian site on the hill above Pogradec. Over time, the city changed hands many times. These occupations have all left a mark on the area, and shows its history. The historic centre of Pogradec shows 19th- and 20th-century Albanian architecture. Floor mosaics and the church Lin show the historic presence of Christianity in the area, dating back to the time of the Byzantine Empire.

Farber and his son, John Farber, co-founded OXO, a manufacturer of kitchen utensils and housewares. Farber is credited with revolutionizing the kitchen utensil industry by developing and introducing a line of utensils with plastic-coated black handles through OXO. While more expensive than traditional utensils, the new soft, black handled utensils proved to be a success with consumers. Early life Sam Farber was born on November 16, 1924, in New York City, though he was raised in nearby Yonkers, New York. His father, Louis Farber, established Farber Brothers, which sold serving ware. His uncle, Simon Farber, founded Farberware, which manufactures kitchen appliances and cookware. Farber served in North Africa and Turkey during World War II as a member of the Army Air Forces. He received a bachelor's degree in economics from Harvard University in 1946. Career =Copco= In 1960, Farber founded Copco, which manufactured enamel-coated, cast iron cookware. He sold Copco in 1982, largely retiring from the industry at the time of the sale. =OXO= Farber founded OXO as a result of improvements he made to an everyday vegetable peeler. While vacationing in a rented home in southern France, his wife, Betsy Farber, who suffered from arthritis, was trying to peel apples, which proved difficult using a peeler with a standard design. The difficulties presented by available peelers (and their handles) sparked an idea for Sam. He and his son, John, soon hired Smart Design, an industrial design firm based in New York City, with which they created a new product line of kitchen utensils fitted with soft plastic-coated black handles, which made them easier to hold and utilize than other utensils. Farber unveiled the new line at the Gourmet Products Show in San Francisco, California, in 1990. Sam Farber named his company \\"OXO\\" for its \\"backward, upside-down and vertical graphic symmetry.\\" Farber's OXO products were more expensive than competitors', but the line proved a hit with consumers, who were willing to pay more for the new, easier-to-use utensils. The Farber family sold OXO to General Housewares Corporation in 1992. OXO is currently owned by Helen of Troy Limited, as of 2013. =Mario Batali products= Sam and John Farber later created a line of products sold by chef Mario Batali. =Boards= An art collector, Farber served on the board of directors for the American Folk Art Museum in Manhattan. Personal life He was a longtime resident of Manhattan but lived in Lexington, Massachusetts, during his later years. Death Sam Farber died in East Meadow, New York of complications from a fall on June 16, 2013, at the age of 88. He was survived by his second wife, Betsey Wells Kriegsman, whom he married in 1985; his two sons from his first marriage, John Farber and Thomas Farber; two stepchildren, Mark Kriegsman and Sue Kriegsman; four granddaughters; and three step- granddaughters.

It was compiled under Emperor Louis the Pious in 819, probably as a summation of the royal reform of the monasteries carried out following the councils of 816 and 817.Bernhardt (1993), 77 and n. 150.Reuter (1991), 44. It is not a complete list of the reformed monasteries: only 82 of the 104 monasteries known to have adopted the reforms are listed in the Notitia.Zola (2008), 128–29. There three basic services monasteries could owe to the sovereign. Militia was military service. Dona was an annual gift, tax or service \\"donated\\" to the king. Orationes was the obligation to pray for the royal family and the state of the realm. Collectively, these were known by the technical term servitium regis (\\"king's service\\"), hence the servitio of the Notitia's title.Bernhardt (1993), 77. The service of prayer, although specified in the Notitia, appears to have been considered a general obligation of all ecclesiastical institutions in the empire.Bernhardt (1993), 75–76 and n. 143. The burden of these services seem to have been more severe in west Francia than in east Francia. Only four monasteries east of the Rhine owed all three services: Lorsch, Schuttern, Mondsee and Tegernsee.Bernhardt (1993), 112 and n. 116. The monastic reforms undertaken in the years preceding the Notitia's compilation were led by the monk Benedict of Aniane. One of his chief concerns was to secure an income for the exclusive use of the monks. This was because at the time monasteries frequently granted revenue-generating lands as benefices to laymen in return for the laymen's service, a process known as enfeoffment.Bernhardt (1993), 92–93. Since monasteries could be governed by a secular abbot, that is, by an abbot who was not under the rule (regula) of the monastery, property and thus revenue could be alienated without regard for the needs of the monks. To prevent this, Benedict frequently designated some land as belonging exclusively to the prebend (endowment) of the monks. According to the Vita sancti Benedicti Anianensis, a biography of Benedict written by his disciple Ardo, the emperor Louis determined which monasteries in the realm were required to have a regular abbot, in order to prevent the abuse of monks by laymen. Although this list was probably a companion of the Notitia, it has not come down to us. Manuscripts In 1629, Jacques Sirmond published the Notitia based on a codex he found in the abbey of Saint-Gilles, but he did not edit it.Lesne (1920), 451–52. This had to await André Duchesne in 1636, who was apparently unaware of Sirmond's earlier publication. This manuscript is now lost and since both Sirmond and Duchesne only published the Notitia it is impossible to ascertain whether the codex also contained the chronicle found in a different manuscript from the same abbey. The age of this manuscript is also unknown. In 1750, Léon Ménard published a text of the Notitia based on a 13th-century manuscript from Saint-Gilles. The manuscript contains a chronicle written by the same hand as the Notitia, and which covers the years 813–18.Lesne (1920), 449–50. The brief, perhaps fragmentary, chronicle appears to depend entirely upon the Chronicon Moissiacense for its information, and the author only cared to include information on the major ecclesiastical assemblies of the period. A related work is the Chronicon Anianense. Both are associated with the monastery of Santa Maria de Ripoll: the Anianense was found there, but is named for Benedict's monastery at Aniane, with which the chronicler showed an acute interest; and the Moissiacense was probably written there, although it was discovered at Saint-Pierre de Moissac. According to Wilhelm Pückert, the chronicle was probably composed by the scribe who wrote the manuscript and also copied in the Notitia. List of monasteries =Dona et militia= The first grouping of monasteries is \\"those which must make a gift and a militia\\" (haec sunt quae dona et militiam facere debent).From the edition in Lesne (1920), 489–93.

He is considered one of the founders and leading figures in the success of the Montreal Protocol that has phased out the chemicals that deplete the stratospheric ozone that protects the Earth against the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation that causes skin cancer, cataracts, and suppression of the human immune system, and destroys agricultural crops and natural ecosystems. Because ozone-depleting chemicals are also powerful greenhouse gases the Montreal Protocol also protected climate. Early life Andersen was born in Logan, Utah, United States, the child of a professor of horticulture and a botanist. He studied business administration for two years at Utah State University and then transferred in 1969 to the University of California, Berkeley where he earned B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Agricultural and Natural Resources Economics. His PhD dissertation at UC Berkeley was supervised by Drs. Siegfried von Ciriacy- Wantrup who was among the first to describe the importance to sustainability of common property, conservation, land use planning, endangered species and biodiversity and pioneered the Precautionary Principle and the \\"Safe Minimum Standard\\" the threshold below which loss in sustainability is catastrophic and irreversible. While a graduate student he was a member of the U.S. Department of Transportation “Climatic Impact Assessment Program” (CIAP) assessing the environmental and economic impacts of the decline in northern latitude grain production predicted as a consequence of climate change and depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer. Andersen began his professional career in 1974 at the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund (now Earthjustice), where he provided litigation support for cases including energy conservation, forestry, mining, national parks and marine mammal protection. In 1976 he joined the Environmental Law Institute as their first economist working on a series of five books on energy conservation and later on a study with Lisle Baker (Suffolk University Law School) on the Vermont Land Gains Tax (1981). From 1977 to 1986, Andersen was a professor at College of the Atlantic, Bar Harbor Maine, visiting professor at the University of Hawaii, Manoa, and visiting scholar at Kyoto University. Ozone Action  Stephen O. Andersen and Madhava Sarma meeting with the Pope John Paul II in Rome in November 2002 In 1986, Andersen joined the fledgling U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) team that built the scientific, technical and economic case for protecting the stratospheric ozone layer. At EPA he rose to Deputy Director for Stratospheric Ozone Protection and then transferred to the Climate Protection Partnerships Division, where he was Director of Strategic Climate Projects until his retirement from government in 2009. The timing of Andersen's arrival at EPA was fortuitous. 1987 proved to be a watershed moment in the effort to stop ozone depletion, which increased risks of skin cancer and threatened to wipe out crops and ecosystems, among many adverse impacts. The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was agreed on 16 September 1987 and created a timetable to phase out and eliminate the production of ozone depleting substances. At EPA, Andersen's responsibilities included analysis of regulatory impact, cost, and trade, technology co-operation, and sector projects in halons, foams, mobile air conditioning, and military uses. Over his tenure he pioneered EPA's voluntary approaches to ozone layer protection including the phase-out of chlorofluorocarbon(CFC) in the manufacturing of food packaging, the recycling of CFC from vehicle air conditioning, the halt to testing and training with halon, and the accelerated CFC solvent phase-out in electronics manufacturing. Andersen also brought Soviet authorities together with NASA scientists and EPA senior managers to gain agreement for US Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) be carried to space on a Soviet Meteor-3 satellite(1994) rocket in order to overcome loss of access to space (resulting from the Space Shuttle Challenger accident); he founded and managed the first EPA international awards, the U.S. EPA Stratospheric Protection Awards and Climate Protection Awards; and was EPA Liaison to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) on stratospheric ozone and climate, chairing several DoD committees on solvent validation, aircraft maintenance, manufacturing rockets without ozone-depleting substances, and certifying the Joint Strike Fighter for particulate emissions. Whilst at EPA Andersen co- Chaired the 1989 Economic Assessment Panel, the 1989–1997 Solvents Coatings and Adhesives Technical Options Committee, the 1992 Methyl Bromide Assessment and since 1989 co-founded and co-chaired the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP). Over the decades, the Montreal Protocol became a victim of its own success. By 2006, some called for dismantling the treaty, claiming it had achieved its goals and outlived its usefulness. Andersen knew the Protocol needed to be not only preserved but strengthened. In 2007 Andersen assembled a team of scientists, led by Dutch scientist Dr. Guus Velders, to research the role of the Protocol in climate protection. In 2007 Andersen and the Velders’ team published “The Importance of the Montreal Protocol in Protecting Climate.” The team quantified the benefits of the Montreal Protocol, and found that it helped prevent 11 billion metric tons of CO2equivalent emissions per year from 1990 to 2010, having delayed the impacts of climate change by 7 – 12 years. The paper determined the Montreal Protocol had been the most successful climate agreement in history, it also estimated the joint ozone and climate benefits of an accelerated hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC) phaseout, providing policymakers with information needed to accelerate the phaseout. In 2009, Andersen retired from the EPA and joined Durwood Zaelke at the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development (IGSD) as director of research, where he has continued in his pursuit of ozone and climate protection. In 2009, Andersen and the Velders’ team published their second paper “The Large Contribution of Projected HFC Emissions to Future Climate Forcing”, which used future HFC production and consumption scenarios to show that without new controls, HFC emissions lead to substantial climate warming by the middle of the 21st century. The two Velders papers helped build the foundation that inspired other scientists to calculate and communicate the interlinkages of ozone with climate and the importance of phasing out ODSs and phasing-down HFCs. Andersen's research and work at IGSD, and over his career, culminated on 15 October 2016 when the Parties to the Montreal Protocol agreed to the Kigali Amendment, an amendment to the Protocol for the inclusion and regulation of HFCs. The Kigali Amendment will limit warming from HFCs to 0.06 °C, avoiding nearly 0.5 °C of warming by 2100 and 80 Gt CO2e by 2050. To date Andersen now concentrates on achieving the HFC phasedown as quickly as feasible with higher energy efficiency at affordable prices. He is also part of the team using government procurement to purchase super-efficient room ACs at an affordable price around the world, using the Life Cycle Climate Performance (LCCP) method to evaluate the carbon footprint and global warming impact of heating, ventilation, air conditioning (AC) and refrigeration systems, and of the team demonstrating secondary-loop motor vehicle air conditioning.

The Indios were based in Ciudad Juárez, in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. The team also was known as the Ciudad Juárez Indios or the Juarez Indios. The team's name was chosen to honor statesman Benito Juárez, who described himself as the son of Indians of the primitive race of the country.Historical Text Archive – Benito Juárez, Apuntes Para Mis Hijos (Notes for My Children), ca. 1857 Early history Organized Mexican baseball started in 1937, when a league featuring teams from the cities of México, Tampico and Veracruz played a modest 25 game schedule. Gradually increasing the number of games, the independent Mexican baseball circuit was playing nearly a 100-game schedule by the end of World War II. At the beginning, teams in the Mexican League, which played in the winter, included on their rosters baseball stars of the Negro National League. Prohibited from playing in Organized Baseball, the African-Americans ballplayers were welcomed and excelled in Mexico. For instance, in 1938 Martín Dihigo posted an 18-2 record and a 0.90 earned run average as a pitcher, while winning the batting title with a solid .387 average.Baseball Statistics – Martin Dihigo Two years later, Cool Papa Bell won the Triple Crown, while batting .437 with 12 home runs and 79 runs batted in.Negro Leagues Legacy – Cool Papa Bell 1946 In 1946, the Mexican National League was founded and joined the ranks of Organized Baseball as a Class B circuit. The league included six franchises that represented Mexico City (Aztecas), Chihuahua (Dorados), El Paso (Tejanos), Saltillo (Peroneros), Torreón–Gómez Palacio (Laguneros), and Ciudad Juárez (Indios).Baseball Reference – Mexican National League (B) Encyclopedia and History Unfortunately, it was to be a short-lived experiment because of competition from an independent Mexican League. This operation, bankrolled by Mexican entrepreneur Jorge Pasquel, placed franchises in two of the same cities, Mexico City and Torreón, forcing the Class B competition to fold. As a result, the MNL México and Torreón clubs retired in late April and the remaining of the league collapsed on May 27, just when Juárez and Chihuahua were tied in first place with a 23-21 record.Johnson, Lloyd; Wolff, Miles (1993). Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball. Baseball America. After that, the outlaw Mexican League also became a threat to Major League Baseball for the rest of the decade. 1947–1954 In 1947 the Indios de Ciudad Juárez took refuge in the Class C Arizona–Texas League, but suspended operations during the midseason and were replaced by the Mesa Orphans. When the Indios reorganized in 1948, they changed their misfortune and advanced to the postseason three years in a row. In 1948, Ciudad Juárez finished fourth with a 74-66 record and lost the league finals to the Globe- Miami Browns. They improved to 92-58 in 1949, good for a second place, but did not advance from the first round.Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball Then, in 1950 they won the regular season with a record of 93-55 and defeated the Phoenix Senators in the best-of-seven Series, four games to two. That season, Ciudad Juárez was managed by Syd Cohen, a former Washington Senators pitcher, better known for giving up Babe Ruth his final home run and final strikeout for the New York Yankees in 1934.Retrosheet – Washington Senators 8, New York Yankees 5 (1). Game Played on Saturday, September 29, 1934 (D) at Griffith Stadium In 1951 the Arizona–Texas League merged with the Sunset League to form the Southwest International League.Baseball Reference – Southwest International League (C) Encyclopedia and History Ciudad Juárez finished second with an 87-57 record in the 10-team league, but did not advance pass the first round of the playoffs. The Arizona–Texas League broke off again in 1952, operating through 1954, before changing its name to the Arizona–Mexico League the following season. The Indios were successfully in this three-year span, claiming their second championship title in 1952 with an 84-55 record, and ending 74-65 for a third place in 1953. By the time playoffs were not played. Then, the league expanded from six to eight teams in 1954 and became more competitive, which affected the Indios performance, which ended last with a 55-85 mark, 38 games out first place. The team took a break in 1955. 1956–1958 The Indios found itself on the move again, this time in the short-lived Mexican Center League, a Class C six-team circuit that operated from 1956 to 1957.Baseball Reference – Central Mexican League (C) Encyclopedia and History They finished with a modest record of 48-52 in 1956, enough for a third place, 10½ games out of contention. The team failed again in 1957, ending fourth with a 49-51 mark, 13 games out of first place. In 1958 Ciudad Juárez became a member of the aforementioned Arizona–Mexico League. The Indios placed fifth of six teams with a record of 55-64, 12½ games out of first place. After that, the team suspended operations for a long time. 1973–1984 Ciudad Juárez returned to action after 15 years of absence, as part of the revamped Mexican League from 1973 through 1984.Baseball Reference – Mexican League (AAA) Encyclopedia and History The Mexican League had begun to operate as a Triple A circuit in 1967 and was a very strong organization. By the time the Indians made their debut, the league had 16 teams distributed in four divisions.Baseball Reference – 1973 Mexican League Following three disastrous seasons from 1973–1975, the Indios became a seasoned squad after that. The team won the Northwest Division in 1976 but lost in the second round of the playoffs. Then, they advanced to the finals in 1979, losing to the Angeles de Puebla in the maximum seven games. In 1980, Ciudad Juárez finished second in the supplemental season put on by a few teams after the regular season was stopped by a players strike. Then, the Indios advanced to the postseason in 1981 but lost in the first round. Finally, they clinched the Championship title in 1982 and were runners-up in the 1983 and 1984 seasons, losing to the Piratas de Campeche (4-3) and the Leones de Yucatán (4-2), respectively. The Indios posted a collective record of 819–777 (.513) during their 12 seasons in the league. Since 1984, no other team based in Ciudad Juárez has participated in organized baseball.

Beavers Reserve Fund Fraternity  The earliest \\"beaver\\" fraternal order was the Beavers Reserve Fund Fraternity founded in 1902, and initially based in Stoughton, Wisconsin. It was later based in Madison. It only operated in the state of Wisconsin and had 16,900 members as of Jan. 1, 1923.Preuss, Arthur A Dictionary of Secret and other Societies St. Louis: B. Herder Book Co. 1924; republished Detroit: Gale Reference Company 1966; p.58Alvin J. Schmidt Fraternal Orders (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press), 1980, p. 51  Beavers National Mutual Benefit  The Beavers National Mutual Benefit grew out of the above group in 1916. Members of the Beavers Reserve Fund Fraternity who felt that the latters flat rate assessment policy was insufficient were allowed to transfer their policies to the new organization. That same year the new organization absorbed the Fraternal Order of Rangers and the Supreme Assembly of the Defenders. In 1919 it absorbed the National Fraternal League. The group discarded its ritual and became National Mutual Benefit in 1931.Schmidt pp.50-1. Schmidt states on p.227 that the National Fraternal League merged with the \\"Beavers Reserve Fund Equity\\" and Beavers National Mutual Benefit This order absorbed two further organizations, the Farmers Life Insurance Association, in 1931, and the United Danish Society of America in 1945. As of January 1, 1923 this incarnation of the Beavers had 9,626 members in 244 lodges spread across Wisconsin, Illinois and Florida and was headquartered in its own building in Madison, WisconsinPreuss p.58 It had 80,000 members in 1979.Schmidt pp.231 The group had 60,000 members in 1994. Though it no longer has the Beavers appellation, or the ritual, its local lodges were still known as \\"Colonies\\" in the mid-1990s.Axelrod p.180 It remains headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin.Schmidt pp.231  Fraternal Order of Beavers  The Fraternal Order of Beavers was founded in 1911 and reorganized in 1919. This order admitted white men who believed in a Supreme Being, ages sixteen to fifty five, but otherwise did not question candidates religious, political or national background. This Order had 12,000 members in 53 lodges in the early 1920s, and was headquartered at the Liberty Building in Philadelphia.Preuss p.58-9 The Fraternal Order of Beavers' ritual was centered around the beavers of the Valley of Turquemanau and their conflict with the Iroquois and involved the candidate being taken as an \\"Algonquian captive\\" \\"through the rapids in a canoe to Ahmeek, King of all Beavers.\\"Preuss p.58 Most benefits and activities were administered on the local level and included building and loan associations, employment bureau, contingency funds for members in distress, bands and degree teams. Funeral benefits were handled by the \\"Funeral Benefit Association of Beavers lodges only\\", which was apparently the same organization as the Beavers Benefit Association, also located in the Liberty Building.

History Gold was found in the Pine Nut Mountains of western Nevada, and in June 1860, the Palmyra mining district was created. The town of Como was established in late 1862, during the gold rush in Palmyra Mining District. Two bills were under consideration in December, 1862, by the Nevada Territorial Legislature in Carson City, to build a toll road from Carson City to Como. One of the bills was approved on December 18, 1862, providing an act chartering a toll road from Como to the Carson river, and the building of a bridge to cross the river. A correspondent of the Sonoma County Democrat in California, who personally visited Como on February 10, 1863, stated in the March 19, 1863 issue that: > We were surprised in finding Como a flourishing Mining town, having in it > four hotels, four dry-good stores, two livery stables, eight saloons, one > brewery, besides a tin shop a blacksmith shop and numerous dwelling houses; > they are also establishing a school and weekly news paper; the paper we are > informed is to be under the supervision of, Messrs. Weston and Abraham, late > of the Petaluma Journal. I. D. Cross formerly a merchant of Petaluma, is > proprietor of the National Hotel; which as a first class house of > refreshments is second to none this side the Sierra Nevada slope. The town eventually reached a population of as many as \\"several thousand\\" people. Como's first rock mill, a steam driven contraption called \\"The Solomon Davis,\\" arrived with much fanfare in 1863. Although several sources have stated that Como was the first seat of Lyon County, nearby Dayton was officially appointed as the first county seat by the Nevada Territorial Legislative Assembly on November 29, 1861. New mineral discoveries a short distance away led to the platting of the Como town site, while the site of Palmyra waned. Tunnels were opened and a small mill was built by J.D. Winters. But Winter's efforts to make a profit proved to be unsuccessful and he later drifted to Virginia City, becoming an employee of the Yellow Jacket Mine. The business sector of the camp had all the usual amenities of frontier life. A highlight of town was the Cross Hotel, a first class establishment with a parlor, bar, carpeted rooms, and a meeting hall. Como had a newspaper, The Como Sentinel, published between April 16, 1864 to July 9, 1864 by T.W. Abraham and H.L. Weston (the latter formerly of the Petaluma California Journal.) After the last issue of the Como Sentinel, Abraham and Weston went on to publish the Lyon County Sentinel at nearby Dayton. Probably the most notable of Como's residents was Alfred Doten, one of the members of a group of writers to come out of Nevada known as the Sagebrush School. Doten moved to Nevada in 1863 and became a reporter on the Como Sentinel. He later reported for Virginia Daily Union, Virginia City Territorial Enterprise, and Gold Hill Daily News, which he bought in 1872 and guided to a legacy as one of the leading newspapers of the Comstock Mining District. In addition to his journalistic efforts, Doten is known for his exhaustive private diaries. He began writing them when he boarded a ship to California in 1849 and continued until the last day of his life in 1903. Como's post office operated during two periods, opening originally December 30, 1879 and closing January 3, 1881. During a subsequent revival of the old camp, another post office operated between May 29, 1903 to February 28, 1905. Perhaps the most famous resident of the Como region was Chief Truckee, father of Chief Winnemucca, and befriender of white men. He was the purported savior of emigrant wagon trains and a scout for Kit Carson and John C. Frémont. Today the site is totally abandoned and with only some foundations of the old buildings remaining. In addition to abandoned mines and ghost ruins of the old town, the region also contains rock shelters utilized by Native American tribal people, and petroglyphs done by them at some time in the past.

Biography The only child of Ronald Thorne Sherborn, a Fellow of the Zoological Society of London, amateur photographer and draughtsman, and his wife Evelyn May (née Allman), Sherborn was born and raised in Streatham, a descendant of the Sherborn family of Bedfont,'Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry' vol. 2, 1969, pg. 559, 'Sherborn of Bedfont' Lords of the Manors of Fawns and Cockbell, first recorded in the person of John Sherborn, of Feltham, who appeared in the Middlesex Muster Rolls for Foot Soldiers in 1338 as being required to serve with a bow and arrow. The family had been settled at Bedfont since the 14th century. In his youth, Sherborn was a collector of coins, stamps and Roman pottery, and his enthusiasm for history led him to attend auctions. After Streatham Grammar School, Sherborn joined the R.A.F. Upon his discharge in 1944, Sherborn's interest in architecture led him to survey all the old buildings of Reading. This study qualified him, in 1948, for a position with the newly formed Ministry of Town and County Planning, as an investigator of historic buildings. The work, poorly paid and solitary, was nonetheless his true vocation given his great passion for conservation; given the damage and neglect of wartime and heavy cost in death duties, many formerly great estates were imperiled. He was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries.List of the Society of Antiquaries of London, Bartholomew Press, 1970, pg 42 Although numerous houses of distinction were lost, Sherborn's diligence and effort led to successful rescues of houses such as Calke Abbey, Derbyshire; Lydiard House, at Lydiard Tregoze, Wiltshire; and Cowick Hall in Yorkshire. His 1951 list of 2,000 outstanding country houses for the Gower Report led to the creation, in 1953, of the Historic Buildings Council for England, Wales and Scotland. By 1978, Sherborn was the Ministry's Principal Inspector, on the Listing Committee, Ecclesiastical Buildings Committee and the Outstanding Buildings Committee of the Historic Buildings Council. He retired in 1982. Fawns Manor in Bedfont ('in the unlikely depths of suburban Middlesex'), in the ownership of the Sherborns since the 15th century, was inherited by Sherborn's uncle, the taxonomist Charles Davies Sherborn on the death of his kinsman William Sherborn in 1912. When Charles Davies Sherborn died in 1942, the Manor came to Ronald Thorne Sherborn; the family took up residence in the restored house in 1950.Country Life, vol. 195, 2001, pg. 154 Sherborn lived there after his father's death until 1983, when, following several burglaries, he sold the manor to the British Airways Housing Association and moved to a seafront villa in Brighton. He died in 2004, having published his memoirs, An Inspector Recalls, the previous year. In his Spectator review of the book, Hugh Massingberd noted Sherborn to be 'one of the unsung heroes of conservation' in Britain, and observed that 'the so-called \\"national heritage\\" thus owes Sherborn an immeasurable debt' in light of his efforts.

The granite furnace was built around 1770, measures 30 feet on its south face, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. and Accompanying four photos Now one of the best preserved furnaces in Virginia, it was built against the side of a hill so iron ore, charcoal and limestone could be brought by wagon and dumped into the top of the furnace, although the original cart road and ten-yard-long bridge leading to the top no longer exist. History John Donelson (now perhaps best known as the father of Rachel Donelson, who married future U.S. President Andrew Jackson) and his son-in-law, John Caffery, built the furnace circa 1770 and operated it for about a decade. However, Franklin County would not be created until 1785, from Bedford, County and Henry County (which split from Pittsylvania in 1777). Therefore, Donaldson served on the first court for Pittsylvania County, as well as represented it in the House of Burgesses, and was its militia Colonel and county surveyor. The ironworks, originally simply called \\"The Bloomery\\", supplied Patriot forces in the American Revolutionary War.Marshall Wingfield, Franklin County, Virginia: A History (Berryville, Chesapeake Book Company 1964) p. 82 the (still surviving) ironmaster's house later became known as The Farm. In 1773, four white men and six slaves carted the raw materials, stoked the fires and otherwise worked the furnace.NRIS Section 8 In 1779 Donelson moved to Tennessee and sold the Bloomery to fellow former Burgess James Callaway (1736-1809) and his father-in-law Jeremiah Early (1730-1779; whose great-grandson Jubal A. Early later became a prominent Confederate general), both of Bedford County, Virginia. They named it \\"Washington Iron Forge\\" to honor George Washington. Calloway also owned Oxford furnace in Campbell County, Virginia with Henry Innes, and the Chiswell lead mines further southwest. Prominent landowner Jeremiah Early would soon die and bequeath his share to three of his sons, two of whom also soon died, so John Early sold his share to Calloway in 1781.T. Keister Greer, Genesis of a Virginia Frontier (Rocky Mount, History House Press 2005) pp. 46-47 In 1820, the three Saunders brothers (one of whom married Jeremiah Early's daughter) purchased this and another furnace on Ferrum Creek from Calloway's heirs; by 1836 the Washington mine and furnace employed 100 men, and produced 160 tons of iron annually.NRIS section 8 A nearby vein of high quality magnetite supplied this furnace, and horse-drawn wagons took the refined iron bars and castings down the Carolina Road to North Carolina and Alabama. Reportedly in 1850, a dam on Furnace Creek uphill of the furnace burst, and the resulting water flow cracked the hot furnace, which was not rebuilt by the Saunders family then operating it. The mine would continue operations until 1880; the Pigg River Mining Company shipped ore to Pennsylvania until costs proved too high. The last shafts went 75 feet below the surface and soon filled with water.Greer pp. 82-83 References External links * Category:Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia Category:Industrial buildings completed in 1770 Category:Buildings and structures in Franklin County, Virginia Category:National Register of Historic Places in Franklin County, Virginia Category:Industrial furnaces Category:Ironworks in Virginia Category:1770 establishments in Virginia ","title":"Washington Iron Furnace"},{"id":"39883329","text":"HRT 3 (HTV 3, \\"Treći program\\") is a Croatian free-to-air television channel from Hrvatska Radiotelevizija, that was launched on 13 September 2012.

History The ABP was founded in 1995 as an unincorporated business by two Tuscaloosa-based blues musicians, Debbie Bond and Michael McCracken. Their first project was to produce a CD titled Moody Swamp Blues, the first recording of regional blues veterans Little Whitt and Big Bo. The release of the CD was followed by a European tour in the spring of that same year.http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-2480 In 1998, the ABP established its first blues education program in Tuscaloosa County. This was an after-school program that provided hands-on music training to underserved “at-risk” students aged 8–18. Initially, the ABP partnered with the Kentuck Arts Association and later with the Boys and Girls Club of Tuscaloosa. By 2000, McCracken was no longer working with the project and Bond, working with University of Alabama law professor, blues fan and storyteller Dr. Steven Hobbs, started the process of building a board of directors and turning the ABP into a non-profit organization. The ABP was incorporated in 2001 and was officially granted non-profit status in 2002. Non-profit work Since its inception, the ABP offices were located at Bond’s home, assisted by volunteers and occasionally part-time paid workers. This continued as the ABP embraced its new, non-profit status and as the blues camp program outgrew the small premises at the Boys and Girls Club. The ABP partnered with Tuscaloosa organizations to find suitable premises for their programs, especially Covenant Presbyterian and First United Methodist Church of Tuscaloosa. At the same time, the organization’s budget expanded with grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and increased support from local businesses and individuals. To help fund activities, an annual fund raiser was held in Tuscaloosa. By 2013, the Summer Blues Camp was in its 16th season. The ABP also runs \\"Advanced Band\\", an after-school band for middle and high-school students. The ABP has gained international recognition and accolades from many national arts educators. In 2003, the ABP received the prestigious presidential Coming Up Taller award from the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities given to outstanding after-school programs that teach at-risk students through the arts. Other awards include the Blues Foundation's Keeping the Blues Alive award,https://www.blues.org/kba/#ref=kba_index and two Druid Arts awards.http://www.tuscarts.org/druidartsawards.php The ABP’s education programs and advocacy have received considerable media attention, including coverage in Southern Living, the NEA Arts magazine, AAA Travel, and Oxford American, to name a few. The ABP has become a major resource for consulting on all things Alabama blues.

It and the Heliand, a heroic poem based on the New Testament, a fragment of which is also included in the same manuscript, constitute the only major records of Old Saxon poetry. It is also the basis of the Anglo-Saxon poem known as Genesis B, and Eduard Sievers postulated its existence on linguistic evidence before the manuscript was discovered. Manuscript, dating and provenance Palatinus Latinus 1447 is a computus and is assembled from several components, the earliest of which have been dated to around 813 and are shown by internal evidence to have been originally produced at the St. Alban's Abbey in Mainz.Alger N. Doane, The Saxon Genesis: An Edition of the West Saxon 'Genesis B' and the Old Saxon Vatican 'Genesis, Madison, Wisconsin / London: University of Wisconsin, 1991, , pp. 11-12. The Old Saxon material must have been written down later than an astronomical calculation dated to after 836, and the Genesis fragments are in three different hands which have been assigned on palaeographic evidence to the third quarter of the 9th century.Doane, pp. 12-13. Both Genesis and Heliand appear to be in an artificial literary language,Doane, pp. 44-46. and hence can be placed in the context of a relatively brief period between about 819 and approximately the death of Louis the Pious in 840, when the native Saxon poetic tradition had waned and the Carolingians sought to interest the recently and forcibly converted Saxons in Christian stories. Genesis must be the later of the two, because it alludes to Heliand.Doane, p. 46. Its composition has been located by some scholars at the Abbey of Fulda, a Frankish centre on the edge of Saxon territory, and by others at the Abbey of Werden, in the centre of the Saxon area.Doane, pp. 46-47. Hypothetical reconstruction and discovery In 1875, preparatory to publishing an edition of the Heliand, Eduard Sievers argued in a monograph on it and the Anglo-Saxon Genesis that lines 235-851 of the Anglo- Saxon work were originally a separate poem, which he named 'Genesis B' to distinguish it from the remainder, Genesis A, and that this was an Anglo- Saxonised version of a lost Old Saxon poem corresponding to the Genesis poem referred to in the Latin preface to the Heliand.Doane, p. 7; Eduard Sievers, Der Heliand und die angelsächsische Genesis, Halle: Niemeyer, 1875, His inference, made on metrical and linguistic grounds, was confirmed in 1894 when Karl Zangemeister, the professor of Classics at the University of Leipzig, found and identified the fragments on a visit to the Vatican Library.Karl Breul, \\"Eduard Sievers\\", The Modern Quarterly of Language and Literature 1.3 (1898) 173-75, p. 174. Photographs were made and the first edition of the Old Saxon poem, by Zangemeister with Wilhelm Braune and with an introduction by Rudolf Kögel, was completed by the end of the year.Doane, pp. 7-8. Sievers did revise his original hypothesis that the same poet was responsible for both Heliand and Genesis.Doane, p. 7. Text, Anglo-Saxon poem and possible sources The manuscript preserves three fragments: * a speech by Adam from after the Fall * a segment concerning Abraham and Sodom * a segment concerning Cain and Abel. These correspond respectively to lines 790-817a, 151-337, and 27-150 of the Anglo-Saxon Genesis B.Doane, p. 13. Stylistically, Genesis even more than the Heliand shows that it is the product of a written tradition: although it retains features of Germanic oral heroic poetry such as alliteration and formulaic diction, it is discursive and uses long, connected clauses, and the language shows signs of developing towards the use of particles rather than case endings. Anglo-Saxon poetry had a longer written history beginning with the retaining of oral poetry, and the Anglo-Saxon translator of Genesis B has tightened up the loose connections by using more subordinate clauses.Doane, pp. 89-90. The metre is also less varied than in the Heliand.Seiichi Suzuki, The Metre of Old Saxon Poetry: The Remaking of Alliterative Tradition, Cambridge / Rochester, New York: D. S. Brewer, 2004, , p. 365. In some places, Genesis B has been further revised in the manuscript to make it more Anglo-Saxon in syntax, word forms, and (late West Saxon) spelling.Doane, pp. 50-51. Metrically and grammatically, the Anglo-Saxon poem shows few signs of being a translation.Peter J. Lucas, \\"Some Aspects of \\"Genesis B\\" as Old English Verse\\", Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, Section C, Volume 88 (1988) 143-78, p. 172. The poem diverges from the story of the Fall as told in the Vulgate. Adam is tempted by a demon in the guise of an angel, not by a \\"serpent\\" as in the Bible, and Eve plays a much more active role: Adam is tempted first and refuses, and the tempter tells her to persuade him by telling him the forbidden fruit bestows divine powers; she instead proves it to him by recounting a blissful heavenly vision.Andrew Cole, \\"Jewish Apocrypha and Christian Epistemologies of the Fall: The Dialogi of Gregory the Great and the Old Saxon Genesis\\", in Rome and the North: The Early Reception of Gregory the Great in Germanic Europe, ed.

Although it has been suggested that the vision derives from a Germanic source--the relationship of the lord to his war-band or comitatus--the likeliest source appears to be Jewish apocryphal texts and the writings of Pope Gregory the GreatCole, pp. 159-60, 187. or other contemporary biblical interpreters,Doane, pp. 95-96.Thomas N.

It also reflects the theological crisis in the Carolingian Empire in the mid-9th century over free will and predestination, focussing on Gottschalk of Orbais.Doane, pp. 102-06. However, the poem also reflects Germanic concepts in the role of Eve as advisor to her husband, in the feud element of the Fall, and in the mention in Genesis B, presumably present in the Old Saxon original and also present in the Heliand, of Satan employing a hæleðhelm or helm of disguise.Hill, pp. 178-79, 183.

A colonel, he fell in battle in Santa Clara, Cuba. He is considered a hero in Cuba and the Parque Vidal in Santa Clara was named in his honor. Vidal was the uncle of General Emilio Mola. Early life Born in Cuba to a Cuban mother, Marina del Rosario Caro Reyes, and a Spanish father, Leoncio Vidal Tapia, Vidal and his family lived through the calamities of the Ten Years' War in the town of Corralillo. Vidal's father enlisted in the Spanish forces against the Cuban rebels. However, the killing of a ten-year-old boy drove him to protest the war and move his family to Spain. The Vidal family lived ten years in Barcelona, the birthplace of Leoncio Vidal Tabia. There, Leoncio Vidal y Caro met his extended family, including their paternal grandfather whom awed Leoncio with his stories of resistance against Napoleon's invasion of Spain and the faith in and defense of the country. Known as \\"the Cubans\\" while in Spain, Vidal and his brothers learned Catalan quickly. Always concerned for their education, Vidal's father sent the brothers to a school in Manresa. During this time, the Carlist Wars ravaged Northern Spain. The young and idealist Vidal brothers embraced the Carlist ideology, and fled the school and joined the guerrillas around Manresa. The chief of the guerrillas recognized the young boys, and ordered them back to school. Vidal, however, escaped and returned to the guerrillas, where he fought in battle and received a head wound. Vidal's father transferred Vidal and his brothers back to Barcelona, where they studied business, English, French, among other subjects. Life In 1878 the Ten Years' War ended, and the Vidal family returned to Cuba. Rather than return to Corralillo, they settled in Camajuani, where there were lucrative business opportunities. There, the Vidal brothers grew very close, and became integrated in the social and cultural life of the Cuban town. They started a newspaper and spoke out against the exploitation of poor farmers. They also the modernization of the island, including the introduction of electricity, the creation of a firefighting corps, the construction of an aqueduct, and efforts to increase literacy. Leoncio Vidal became involved early on in revolutionary activities. He attended secret meetings and discussions with other Cubans that would become revolutionaries. The Vidal brothers and the revolutionaries began printing the newspaper with revolutionary and progressive ideas. Vidal urged poor farmers to work with him to protest the unjust prices charged by middlemen. Vidal quietly looked for people with whom to collaborate, and created a secret army that spied and penetrated the Spanish ranks and created a network for trafficking medicine, weapons, and strategic information. Vidal collaborated with a telegraph worker to obtain the first electric dynamite detonator. He also gained the support of certain wealthy persons and maintained sources for medicine. Vidal's wife Rosa Caro and a group of women played an important role in smuggling medicine, ammunition, clothes, food, and information. Vidal traveled the countryside looking for supporters for his cause under the pretext of planting cotton with success. When the War of Independence began in 1895, the great majority of the farmers joined him. With the rank of colonel, Vidal fought in many battles and skirmishes, including: The attack of the fort in Santa Fe on October 30, 1895; The attack of a train and looting of its goods on November 25, 1895; The skirmish in Las Yaguas on December 21, 1895; Led the guerrillas of Camajuani with machetes in San Lorenzo, capturing rifles, machetes, and horses on January 12, 1896; The skirmish of Palo Prieto on February 8, 1896; and The Battle of Santa Clara (not to be confused with the 1958 Battle of Santa Clara) on March 23, 1896. Vidal led the only column of men to penetrate the city of Santa Clara and advance to the center of the city. He reached the city plaza, where Spanish riflemen shot and killed Vidal. The death of the colonel dealt a major blow the rebels. Today, Vidal is remembered as a hero of Cuba's independence. The central park of Santa Clara, Parque Vidal, is named in his honor. Family Vidal's brother was imprisoned by the Spaniards. He led a hunger strike, and died. Vidal's other brother emigrated to New York City. Vidal's sister married a Spanish Guardia Civil officer, who fought the Cuban rebels in Placetas, Cuba. Their son and Vidal's nephew, Emilio Mola Vidal, was born in Cuba, and left to Spain after Cuba achieved independence. He fought in the Spanish-Moroccan Wars, led the uprising against the Second Spanish Republic, sparking the Spanish Civil War. General of the Army of the North, he too would die in war.

In Allgemeines Künstler-Lexikon, volume 75 (Berlin and Boston: Walter de Gruyter, 2012), p. 288. artist lecture \\"Rede in der Schule\\", Kunstakademie Düsseldorf 1984 Biography From 1977 to 1978 Huber studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule Basel with Franz Fedier, in 1979 at the Royal College of Art, London, and from 1980 to 1983 at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf (as a master student of Fritz Schwegler). From 1992 to 1999 he was Professor at the Hochschule für Bildende Künste Braunschweig and in 1992 interim director of the Centraal Museum, Utrecht. Together with Bogomir Ecker, he initiated and realised the \\"Künstlermuseum\\" in 2001, the reconfiguration of the Museum Kunstpalast's collection in Düsseldorf. Between 2000 and 2002 Huber was Chairman of the Deutscher Künstlerbund (German Artists Association). Work Rede in der Schule, 1983, oil on canvas, 220 x 320 cm, TH-1983-B-01 Thomas Huber is an artist who fuses image and text and lectures on his pictures. He realises his conception of the image in various mediums: paintings, aquarelle, drawings, objects, graphic arts, art within architecture, artist lectures, and artists books. For instance, his painting Rede in der Schule (\\"Lecture in the School\\") depicts the main auditorium in the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf. Rather than showing realities in his work, Huber, like an architect, interweaves the picture space with design structures and allows motifs such as diamonds and squares to become a determining element of the work. Accompanying philosophical and poetic texts demonstrate that the picture space is seen as \\"a meaning space and the picture depth as profundity\\". The artist says about his work: \\"My pictures show spaces. You can see them but you can’t get to them; it is as if they are sealed behind clear glass. The picture is a promise that cannot be honoured, it is a wistful, sad thing.\\" Awards *1984: Kiefer-Hablitzer Foundation Prize *1985: Grant from Kunstfonds, Bonn *1987: Rheinbrücke (today Manor) Art Prize, Basel *1989/1990: Award from the Kulturkreis im Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie [Federal Association of German Industry], Berlin *1993: Prize for Young Swiss Art from the Zürcher Kunstgesellschaft (Kunstpreis der Stadt Zürich)Invar Hollaus, \\"Huber, Thomas\\", AKL, volume 75 (Berlin and Boston: Walter de Gruyter, 2012), p. 288. *1993: Kunstpreis der Stadtsparkasse Düsseldorf *1995: Niedersächsischer Kunstpreis, Hannover *1999: Art Multiple Prize, Düsseldorf (today Cologne Fine Art & Antiques-Preis), Cologne *2005: Prize of the Heitland Foundation (Kunstpreis der Heitland Foundation, Celle) *2013: Prix Meret Oppenheim, Bern Das Kabinett der Bilder, 2004, Oil on canvas, 250 x 360 cm, Aargauer Kunsthaus in Aarau, TH-2004-B-01 Major Exhibitions *Thomas Huber.

The name may have derived from earlier holders of the lands, however the Sempill family held them since at least 1220. The castle was abandoned circa 1550 when John Sempill, 1st Lord Sempill moved to a new castle at Castleton which he renamed Castle Semple (NS 377602). The History of the Lands of Elliston In 1540 the lands of Castleton, Eliotstoun, Schutirflat, Nethir-Pennell, Hairstontoun, Lavane, Bargane and Lecheland were incorporated into the new Barony of Semple, together with other lands in Lanark and Ayr. The new barony was held by William, Lord Sempill and the principal dwelling or messuage was Castle Semple.Metcalfe, Page 423 Most of the lands within the parish of Lochwinnoch were once held by the Semples of Elliston.

Biography Carlo Pollonera's father, Giovanni B. Pollonera, was a lawyer in Alexandria. He died when Carlo was a child, after which his mother returned to Italy (Genoa) and remarried. As a seventeen-year-old, Carlo fought with Garibaldi on the Trentino campaign of 1866. In 1865, the family had moved to Turin, where Pollonera began studying painting with Alberto Maso Gilli. He enrolled at the Accademia Albertina and studied under Gamba and Andrea Gastaldi. Pollonera was a rebellious pupil, wanting to paint exactly what he saw, rather than, for instance, changing a distracting background. This principle not to improve on what he saw remained a hallmark of his painting throughout Pollonera's career. After four years with Gastaldi, in 1873 he switched to study in the private school of Antonio Fontanesi. In January 1875, he travelled with his close friend Carlo Stratta to Paris, where he studied under Thomas Couture and was influenced by the Barbizon school. Arte Piemonte website, biography by MLRdv. Other visits were to Milan in 1874 and to Rome between 1900 and 1912, where he associated with Antonio Mancini, Pietro Canonica and John Singer Sargent. His Card Players, one of his first works, was exhibited at the 1873 Promotrice of Turin, where he subsequently exhibited regularly.

In 1882, he exhibited the life-size portrait of Il seminatore.Dizionario degli Artisti Italiani Viventi: pittori, scultori, e Architetti., by Angelo de Gubernatis. Tipe dei Successori Le Monnier, 1889, page 384. Some of his paintings are nowadays valued at thousands, or even tens of thousands, of euros. Slug genitalia drawn by Pollonera illustrating an article* As a child, Pollonera had become the stepson of the prominent natural scientist and senator Michele Lessona, whose second wife (Pollonera's mother, Adele Masi Lessona) and children were much involved in his scientific output, particularly the translations. Although Pollonera had started to study natural sciences, he soon switched to painting. Nevertheless from 1882 to 1916 Pollonera wrote over 50 scientific articles on non-marine molluscs. See his bibliography page. Most articles were written in Italian for Italian journals, but there were also instance of articles written in French, English, Portuguese and German for journals of those countries. His peak output was in the decade 1884–1893, when working on the fauna of Italy and adjacent areas; only 16 articles appeared after 1898, when his attention shifted more to the fauna of Africa. Pollonera's first publication was a monograph on Italian slugs in conjunction with his younger half-brother Mario Lessona, but subsequently he was always the sole author. However, the section below on taxa named after Pollonera provides many examples of generous cooperation with other scientists, sometimes authoring species descriptions in other's papers or drawing the plates. Whilst some of his papers are collections of brief notes about disparate topics, others are authoritative monographs about particular taxa. His obituarist Colosi points out that his thorough and keenly-observed species descriptions were appreciated even by those who disagreed with his conclusions about the systematics. His skill as an artist is also apparent in the plates illustrating his articles (see examples below). One particularly important aspect of his research is that he dissected the animals to provide extra anatomical characters; this has since become standard but was \\"cutting-edge\\" at the time. This approach is particularly valuable in studying slugs, which was the group that he published most on, although others of his papers concern terrestrial snails and occasionally freshwater and fossil faunas. His collection is in the Museo Regionale di Scienze Naturale di Torino. For 20 years Pollonera was in a relationship with a pianist, whose name is now lost; this was one reason that he remained in Turin. But in 1913 Pollonera married Ulma de'Bartolomeis (1886–1981), 37 years his junior, who had taken private painting classes with him. They are known sometimes to have worked on the same canvas together. There was just one daughter, Sabina (1914–1996). Carlo Pollonera died on 17 June 1923 after a short stay in the San Giovanni hospital in Turin. Pollonera was not a practising Christian but believed in a superior being. Marziano Bernardi summarised his character as, \\"silent and a loner by nature, a rebel and intransigent\\" [\\"un silenzioso e un solitario per temperamento, un ribelle e un intransigente\\"]. One striking anecdote is that comments of literary critic and painter Enrico Thovez about the perspective of one of Pollonera's paintings led to Pollonera proposing a duel! Instead the matter was settled in court, and the two protagonists later made up. Bibliography A full bibliography of Carlo Pollonera appears as a separate page. Taxa named after Pollonera The list of taxa that have been named after Pollonera documents not only the esteem in which he was held but also the milieu of his scientific contacts as his influence spread. The first to name a species after Pollonera was his half-brother Mario Lessona, who described the land snail Clausilia pollonerae in 1880. The only locality he listed is one reported by Pollonera. The name is now considered a synonym of Charpentieria dyodon thomasiana. In 1884, the geologist Federico Sacco named a Pliocene freshwater snail Viviparus pollonerae, dedicated to this \\"kind and talented malacologist\\" (\\"al gentile quanto valente malacologo\\"). Sacco also acknowledged Pollonera's help with his work: the two were contemporaries in Turin. In 1886, Sacco named a species of slug known only from its fossil shell (Miocene) as Limax pollonerae after his colleague who \\"so lovingly deals with the study of Limacidae\\" (\\"con tanto amore si occupa dello studio dei Limacidi\\"). The same year, Sacco coined the name Polloneria for a subgenus of the land snail genus Clausilia, naming it after \\"one of the most illustrious Italian malacologists\\"; Polloneria has since been raised to the rank of genus and given rise to the name of the tribe Polloneriini. In the same article Sacco described Ferussacia Pollonerae. Other colleagues in Turin were responsible for the only two non-molluscan species named after Pollonera. In 1896, Achille Griffini named an orthopteran from Central America Cocconotus Pollonerae (now in the genus Eubliastes). And in 1912, Lorenzo Camerano named a horsehair worm Chordodes pollonerae; Camerano was originally, like Pollonera, a painter, who had become a protégé of Pollonera's step-father Michele Lessona, eventually taking his place as head of the Turin museum, becoming a senator, and also marrying Pollonera's half sister Luigia. Meanwhile, Napoleone Pini, based in Milan, had named two species after Pollonera in different 1885 articles printed in the same volume: one was the snail Pupa pollonerae (now Orcula spoliata) and the other the slug Arion pollonerae. In the first case, it was Pollonera who had passed on the specimens of the \\"new\\" species to Pini and, in the second, he had drawn the plates illustrating the article. In 1888, another Italian malacologist Giorgio R. Sulliotti, used the name Polloneria for a genus of sea butterfly. As Sacco had used the name already, this new use was invalid and the older name Heliconoides is used today. A year later Sulliotti named a marine bivalve from Sardinia Tapes Pollonerianus in honour of Pollonera \\"to whom we owe the most recent and best study of the malacological fauna of Piedmont, and with whose friendship I am honored\\". Sullioti compared this form with the common Ruditapes decussatus, from which it is not now distinguished. Pollonera's work and reputation had now begun to spread beyond Italy. In 1889, the German slug specialist Heinrich Simroth named a species of slug from Palermo Agriolimax Pollonerae. This is today considered a synonym of Deroceras panormitanum, which Lessona and Pollonera had already described in 1882, also from Palermo. In 1890, another German, Karl Flach, better known as an entomologist, named a variety of Pupa biplicata as \\"Pollonerae\\", having discussed Pollonera's recent work on this species. The Swedish malacologist Carl Westerlund in 1892 named a soil-living snail from Malta Cionella pollonerae; this is today considered a synonym of Cecilioides acicula. Two expeditions led by Borelli to Paraguay and Argentina yielded mollusc collections that Giuseppe Paravicini (of Milan) and then César Ancey (working in Algeria) wrote up in 1894 and 1897. Each named a snail species after Pollonera: Helix Pollonerae (now in the genus Epiphragmophora) and Bulimulus Pollonerae. Ancey thanked Pollonera for having directed the collection to him. In 1897, the cleric and malacologist Pietro Arbanasich (using the pseudonym Fra Piero) authored the description of a species of semi-slug from Sardinia under the name Vitrina Polloneriana. Really, Pollonera himself wrote and illustrated the description, and one might suppose that the naming was Arbanasich's way of thanking him. Current names in use for this species are Oligolimax pollonerianus and Sardovitrina polloneriana. In his large 1903 monograph on the Corsican non-marine mollusc fauna, the French soldier-turned-malacologist Eugène Caziot named a variety of Helix raspaili as pollonerae (now Tacheocampylaea acropachia pollonerae), acknowledging the considerable help of the \\"Italian dissector\\". The collaboration was close enough that Pollonera is given as the authority for another new species described in the work. The leading North American malacologist Henry Pilsbry named two species after Pollonera in his major 1919 work on molluscs from the Belgian Congo, the slug Trichotoxon pollonerae and the snail Gulella polloneriana. The latter was most likely so named because of its resemblance to G. camerani, which had been described by Pollonera. Ptchotrema pollonerae is another species of landsnail from the Belgian Congo, this one named in 1913 by Hugh Preston, a shell dealer in London who \\"realized the market value of new names\\". Pollonera was commemorated even after his death. In 1939, Polloneria was used a third time, this time by Alonza and Alonza Bissachi, for a subgenus of unrelated hygromiid snails, The next year, to avoid the homonym, they replaced the name with Polloneriella. Polloneriella is nowadays sometimes considered as a montoypic genus or sometimes considered a subgenus of Xerosecta. alt=b&w; image Signature: p. 162 of Taylor (1905). See for other examples.

Jara was tortured and killed by the Chilean Army over several days in Santiago's Estadio Chile (renamed Estadio Víctor Jara in 2004) during the 1973 Chilean coup d'état.  History  Víctor Jara was detained in Estadio Chile among thousands of others during the 1973 Chilean military coup against the Unidad Popular government, of which Jara was an icon. Jara, a popular folksinger, sang for the other detainees to maintain morale. Along with Andean and Chilean folk songs, he sang a \\"manifesto\\" composed his second night there. The militia recognized him for his song and fame and removed him from the crowd. The guards tore off his nails, smashed his hands, and ordered him to play the guitar. He was found dead a week later with signs of brutal treatment and gunshot wounds. The \\"manifesto\\" survived through both the detainees who memorized the song and the scraps of paper containing Jara's handwritten lyrics. Jara's wife, Joan, presented her research into her husband's final days in her essays and 1984 memoir An Unfinished Song. The poem stretches the entrance to the Museum of Memory and Human Rights in Santiago.  Interpretation  In The Meaning of Human Suffering, Dr. Joel Gajardo- Velasquez compares the final line of the poem to the message of the cross: that Jara was able to see \\"the new that will be born in spite of, and probably especially because of, his personal tragedy\\", as \\"suffering without hope is death without resurrection\\".  Response  Naín Nómez placed the poem as the first in a series of semi-anonymous works distributed by hand and designed to challenge the new Chilean state of affairs after the 1973 coup. He cited the poem as an example of poesía de la conciencia outside of the avant-garde tradition. In Resisting Alienation, Christopher Michael Travis writes that the poem \\"poignantly understates the effect of 'Auschwitz' on artistic expression\\". Valerie Alia wrote in Media Ethics and Social Change that Jara's poem itself told the story of the coup and Jara's own unbroken spirit before his death.

When he tells her grandmother, Jane (Ashley Crow), Jane tells her that he must be Nick's older brother, Jake (Chris Zylka) who came back to town for Nick's funeral. Jane also informs Cassie that their Circle is not broken now that Nick is gone, but it's still bounded because when they bound it, they bound their bloodlines, not them, meaning that Jake is part of the Circle and its sixth member. Jane also tells Cassie that she was born to lead her Circle. Later, she gives Cassie the family crystal telling her though not to let anyone know that she has it. Cassie informs the other members about what her grandmother told her about Jake but they are don't seem to trust him, especially Adam (Thomas Dekker) who has history with Jake. They decide not to tell Jake anything yet, since they don't even know if he is aware he is a witch. While they are discussing, someone puts a fire outside their shelter and they put it out with magic. When they do, they see that the person who put the fire marked the ground with a crescent moon symbol. Cassie is going to her grandmother to ask her about the mark and if she knows something. She also tells her that she saw the same mark at Nick's backyard after Jake put out the fire the previous night. Jane informs Cassie that this mark is some kind of warning that was used to warn witches and to stay away from Jake till they know why he is back. When Cassie gets back home, there is a woman (Luisa D'Oliveira) there, named Simone, who attacks her. Jake hears Cassie's screams and he is running to the house to help her. They do a spell together and the woman runs away. After that the Circle knows that Jake is aware about being a witch. He tells them he has no idea who that woman was but later we see him meeting her and asking her to give him the blood she took from Cassie. He then warns her to stay out of his way. At Nick's wake, Simone comes back and Jake is trying to make her leave. She refuses to do it and they start fighting. Cassie who sees the whole scene, helps Jake by using the crystal Jane gave her earlier. Jake ends up killing Simone and then he tells Cassie that probably she is a witch from another Circle. Cassie is trying to convince Jake to stay in town and join them to complete the Circle. Meanwhile, Adam's dad, Ethan (Adam Harrington), is having a conversation with Diana during the wake, telling her that Adam and Cassie are \\"written in the stars\\" and they are destined to be together. Diana after that, combined with Adam's behavior towards Cassie, she breaks up with him. Jane meets Dawn (Natasha Henstridge) telling her that Nick's death was not an accident. Dawn believes that Jane knows what happened but when Jane tells her that Nick was killed by a demon and that the kids had bound their Circle she is relieved. Dawn then meets Charles (Gale Harold) to inform him that Jane has no idea about them but she knows about the kids. Charles though, after killing Nick, seems so lost and like he doesn't care about getting his powers back. The episode ends with Jake meeting a group of people who turn out to be witch hunters and him working with them. Their leader, Isaac (JR Bourne) asks him why he killed Simone and Jake says he didn't have a choice after Cassie saw him talking to her. Isaac says that they shouldn't trust a witch killing other witches but Jake reassures him that he'll do what he came for in town; revenge about his family's death by killing the ones who are responsible, meaning the members of the Circle. Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"Wake\\" was watched by 2.12 million; up 0.23 from the previous episode. =Reviews= \\"Wake\\" received mediocre reviews. Katherine Miller from The A.V. Club gave a B- rate to the episode saying that Charle's guilt of killing Nick might be the path for everyone to discover about the murders that happened in the show so far. \\"After all, the two strongest non-horror scenes of the episode were probably Gale Harold's with his daughter and Dawn, respectively.\\" Matt Richenthal from TV Fanatic rated the episode with 3/5 saying that this episode was boring since it was difficult to follow two outstanding episodes. \\"Granted, \\"Wake\\" was faced with the challenging task of following a pair of outstanding, shocking, suspenseful episodes, but that doesn't change the irony of the episode title: I found it hard to stay awake.\\" Sarah Maines from The TV Chick said that with this episode didn't deliver an entertaining hour this week. \\"Overall, this was a flat, meandering episode, but the ending nicely set up some potential for the next few episodes. I have faith that Jake will improve subsequent episodes (and honestly, he really couldn't ever be as boring as Nick was). But for now, I'll leave you all with my weekly motto for Secret Circle: More Charles and Dawn, less of everyone else.\\" Feature music In the \\"Wake\\" episode we can hear the songs: * \\"Go outside\\" by Cults * \\"Still Life\\" by The Horrors * \\"Cruel & Beautiful World\\" by GROUPLOVE * \\"The Greatest Light Is The Greatest Shade\\" by The Joy Formidable References External links  * Category:2011 American television episodes Category:The Secret Circle (TV series) episodes ","title":"Wake (The Secret Circle)"},{"id":"39883839","title":"List of City Corporations of Bangladesh"},{"id":"39883840","text":"American Made may refer to: Music * American Made (The Oak Ridge Boys album), 1983 \\"American Made\\" (song), the title track from the album * American Made (Wakefield album), 2003 * American Made, album by BoDeans, 2012 *\\"American Made\\", a 1997 song by Jack Off Jill from Sexless Demons and Scars Other uses * American Made (film), a 2017 film starring Tom Cruise * Made in USA, a country of origin mark See also * Made in USA (disambiguation) * Made in America (disambiguation) * American Maid ","title":"American Made"},{"id":"39883861","text":"Art in Paris is an article on the art culture and history in Paris, the capital of France. For centuries, Paris has attracted artists from around the world, arriving in the city to educate themselves and to seek inspiration from its artistic resources and galleries. As a result, Paris has received a reputation as the \\"City of Art\\". Home to some of the world's most famous museums and galleries, including the Louvre and the Musée d'Orsay, the city today remains home to a thriving community of artists. Paris is recognized globally for its public landmarks and masterpieces of architecture including the Arc de Triomphe and a symbol of France, the Eiffel Tower. History Prior to the 12th century, Paris was not yet famed for its art. Italian artists were a profound influence on the development of art in Paris in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in sculpture and reliefs. Painting and sculpture became the pride of the French monarchy and the French royals commissioned many Parisian artists to adorn their palaces during the French Baroque and Classicism era. Sculptors such as Girardon, Coysevox and Coustou acquired a reputation for being the finest artists in the royal court in 17th century France. Pierre Mignard became first painter to the king during this period. In this medieval era, depictions of the Virgin Madonna and her Blessed Child were common, and were written to have shown Paris a \\"protective presence\\". They were frequently damaged, most of the time intentionally. One source states that one vandalised depiction preternaturally oozed out blood. Vincent Van Gogh, 1886, Pont du Carrousel du Louvre Paris was in its artistic prime in the 19th century and early 20th century, when Paris had a colony of artists established in the city, with art schools associated with some of the finest painters of the times. The French Revolution and political and social change in France had a profound influence on art in the capital. Many painters moved towards using vibrant colours and elements of fantasy in their paintings, and Paris was central to the development of Romanticism in art, with painters such as Géricault. Impressionism, Symbolism, Art Nouveau, Neo- Impressionism, Divisionism, Fauvism, Cubism, Art Deco and Abstract art movements evolved in Paris. In the late 19th century and early 20th century many artists worldwide flocked to Paris to exhibit their works in the numerous salons and expositions, such as the Salon d'Automne and Salon des Indépendants, to make a name for themselves. Jean Metzinger, Le goûter (Tea Time), 1911, 75.9 x 70.2 cm, Philadelphia Museum of Art. Exhibited at the 1911 Salon d'Automne. André Salmon dubbed this painting \\"The Mona Lisa of Cubism\\"André Salmon, L'Art Vivant, Paris, 1920André Salmon, Artistes d'hier et d'aujourd'hui, L'Art Vivant, 6th edition, Paris, 1920 Paris continued to exert a \\"strong pull on many aspiring artists from the French provinces\\" at the beginning of the 20th century. Many people, especially women, were attracted by the city's bohemian culture and anti-bourgeois attitudes and found that the city provided them with an artistic and sexual freedom to express themselves unlike in other areas of France. Groups of painters also moved to the city from abroad and formed their schools and galleries in the city, increasing its artistic diversity. For instance, the Académie Vassilieff, which was a special school founded for Russian art students, was specially popular with Russian female painters in the early 20th century, along with the Académie de La Palette, specialized in Cubism.Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, A cubism reader: documents and criticism, 1906-1914, University of Chicago Press, Aug 1, 2008 The Académie Julian was established in 1868. Painters such as Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cézanne, Henri Rousseau, Pablo Picasso, Henry Matisse, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay, Fernand Léger, Henri Le Fauconnier, Juan Gris, María Blanchard, Amedeo Modigliani, Amédée Ozenfant, André Dunoyer de Segonzac, Roger de La Fresnaye and many others became associated with Paris. Following the Armory Show of 1913, New York City increasingly competed with Paris as a hub for artists, and its museums acquired some of the world's most valuable paintings. Schools In 1648, the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture was established to accommodate for the dramatic interest in art in the capital. This served as France's top art school until 1793. Many American artists continued to learn their trade in Parisian schools in the 20th century. From 1900 to 1914, several academies were established in Paris by well-known artists, such as the Académie de La Palette, Académie Alexander Archipenko, Académie de la Grande Chaumière, Académie Humbert, Académie Matisse, Académie Ranson, Académie Russe de Peinture et de Sculpture, Académie Vasilieff, and Académie Vitti. Their competition included more established art schools such as the Académie Colarossi, Académie Julien, Académie Delécluse, and École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts.Delia Gaze, 'Concise Dictionary of Women Artists, 2013 The Golden Age of the Paris School ended with World War II when surrealism became the trend, but Paris remains extremely important to world art and art schooling, with many schools and institutions catering to artists, including the Paris College of Art. Paris also has numerous institutions which specialize in teaching modern art forms, such as the Paris American Academy, which specializes in teaching fashion and interior design. Other schools include: * Académie de La Palette * Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture * École duperré * École des Beaux-Arts * École du Louvre * École nationale supérieure des arts appliqués et des métiers d'art * Gobelins School of the Image * Institut des Hautes Études en Arts Plastiques * Parsons Paris  Museums  The Mona Lisa Room at the Louvre. The Louvre is the world's largest and most famous museum, housing many works of art, including the Mona Lisa (La Joconde) and the Venus de Milo statue. Known as the Great Louvre, it is the national museum and art gallery of France. Francis I ( a connoisseur of Art), initially started building the Louvre as part of the royal palace erected at a location where a 12th-century fortress of Philip Augustus existed. The palace underwent several additions over the centuries. Finally, after the court moved to Versailles in 1682, a proposal to convert the Louvre into a public museum was mooted in the 18th century, and in 1793 Musée Central des Arts in the Grande Galerie was opened to the public. Under Napoleon III, Louvre was further enlarged, and as completed, it has two main quadrilaterals and within two large courtyards. It is considered to possess one of the richest art collections in the world. Its collection is now mainly European art up to the Revolutions of 1848 as paintings of later date have been moved to the Orsay Museum that opened in 1986. Some of the master pieces held by the museum are of the Italian Renaissance painters, and Flemish and Dutch painters of the Baroque period. Some other notable galleries in the Louvre are the department of Egyptian antiquities (collection from 1826) and the Mesopotamian art (in the Near Eastern antiquities gallery). Works by Pablo Picasso and Auguste Rodin are found in the Musée Picasso and the Musée Rodin respectively. The Picasso museum, which was renovated in 2013, is housed in the Hôtel Salé, a mid nineteenth century edifice. It has a rich collection of 3500 drawings, engravings, paintings, ceramic works and sculptures by Pablo Picasso (1881–1973). It was gifted to the government by the kin of Picasso as compensation for the estate tax (droits de succession). The museum which was renovated in 2013 housed in the Hôtel Salé, a mid nineteenth century edifice has a rich collection of 3500 drawings, engravings, paintings, ceramic works and sculptures by the grand maître (great master) Pablo Picasso (1881–1973). It was gifted to the government by the kin of Picasso as compensation for the inheritance tax. Art and artifacts from the Middle Ages and Impressionist eras are kept in the Musée de Cluny and the Musée d'Orsay, respectively. The Musée de Cluny is now named as the Musée National du Moyen Âge. It is housed in the Hôtel des Abbés de Cluny, a 15th-century monument built in medieval architectural style and also holds the remnants of Gallo-Roman thermes (baths) dated around to 200 AD, which is called the cool room. The exhibits in the museum are the former with the prized tapestry cycle The Lady and the Unicorn (La Dame à la Licorne), Netherlands tapestries of the late-15th-century, and gold, ivory and enamel artifacts including manuscripts which are lighted. Paris's newest (and third-largest) museum, the Musée du quai Branly, opened its doors in June 2006 and houses art from Africa, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas, including many from Mesoamerican cultures. In 1998, under the same French president Jacques Chirac, Maison de la Culture du Japon has opened offices near Eiffel Tower. This place show various exhibits on Japanese Art and Culture in Paris. Few art galleries have developed around those places. 7th district have been in recent years active location for new museums development. The Orsey Museum is located in a refurbished former Orsay Railway Station (Gare d'Orsay), a large building in the Beaux Arts architectural style, on the left bank of the Seine River. The museum was opened in 1986 and has exhibits of French painting, sculpture, photography, and decorative arts of the mid and late 19th century; French academic painting and sculpture of the 19th century are by many artist \\"of the late Romantic and Neoclassical, Realist, Barbizon, Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, Divisionist, and Nabi schools.\\" The artistic community of Montparnasse is chronicled at the Musée du Montparnasse. The Musée du Montparnasse located in the 15th arrondissement, in Montparnasse Quarter was opened in May 1998. It was the workshop (atelier) of the Russian painter, Marie Vassilieff, in the early 19th century. and Jean- Marie Drot established the museum as a nonprofit operation. The museum presents a history of the many well known artists such as Amedeo Modigliani, Chaim Soutine, Pablo Picasso, and others. It holds temporary exhibitions of works by Montparnasse artists of the past and present. Starkly apparent with its service-pipe exterior, the Centre Georges Pompidou, also known as Beaubourg, houses the Musée National d'Art Moderne. Many of Paris's once- popular local establishments have come to cater to the tastes and expectations of tourists, rather than local patrons, such as Le Lido on the Avenue Champs- Élysées, among others. The Moulin Rouge cabaret-dancehall, for example, is a staged dinner theatre spectacle, a dance display that was once but one aspect of the cabaret's former atmosphere. All of the establishment's former social or cultural elements, such as its ballrooms and gardens, are gone today. Sculpture Louis XIV equestrian statue The city is filled with sculptures. The equestrian statue of Louis XIV in the Place Vendôme is one of the largest pieces of bronze sculpture ever made, weighing more than 60,000 pounds, and was formed in one cast without a joint. Some of the other prominent statues in Paris are The Thinker, Venus de Milo, and Winged Victory of Samothrace.  Photography  Like painting and sculpture, Paris has also attracted communities of photographers, and was an important centre for the development of photography; indeed inventor Nicephore Niepce produced the first permanent photograph on a polished pewter plate in Paris in 1825, and then developed the process with Louis Daguerre. Paris become the home of a form of photography, Surrealist photography. Numerous photographers achieved renown for their photography of Paris, including Eugene Atget, noted for his depictions of street scenes, Robert Doisneau, noted for his playful pictures of people and market scenes, Marcel Bovis, noted for his night scenes, and others such as Jacques-Henri Lartigue and Cartier-Bresson. Paris also become the hotbed for an emerging art form in the late 19th century, poster art, advocated by the likes of Gavarni. Events The leading French art fair, Foire internationale d'art contemporain (FIAC), is a manifestation of contemporary art that has taken place every year since 1974 in October in Paris. For several days, this exhibition becomes the international meeting place between galleries, collectors, curators, museum directors and personalities from around the world. Another annual art event held in Paris is the Art Paris Art Fair. During 2013, the fair attracted more visitors than in the previous year, when 1500 artists (43% from foreign countries) participated. The fair had 57% of French galleries and 52% new galleries. The event for 2014 is proposed to be held from 27–30 March 2014 at the Grand Palais, with 144 international galleries likely to be on display. The theme proposed is modern and contemporary art including photography, design and art books.

Ford plant Known as Los Angeles Plant #2, the Pico Rivera facility started operations in early August 1957 with the production of 1958 Edsel Corsair and Citation hardtop models. Due to the paint booths not being ready, early Edsel bodies were welded together at the new Los Angeles #2 plant and then trucked to the old Maywood, Los Angeles #2 plant where they could be painted. The bodies were then trucked back to Pico Rivera where they were trimmed out and assembled. In mid September 1957, Mercury production commenced at Los Angeles #2. By December 3, 1957, Edsel production at the Los Angeles plants was discontinued. In March 1959, Ford Division's Long Beach Assembly plant was deemed unsafe and operations were moved to Los Angeles #2 with production starting on April 10, 1959. Through the remainder of 1959 up to the end of the 1962 model year, both Ford and Mercury full size cars were assembled at the Los Angeles plant. Ford Division's Los Angeles Regional offices were also located at the Pico Rivera assembly plant. In February 1962, full-size Mercury cars were discontinued at Pico Rivera/Los Angeles replaced by the compact Comets, while full-size Ford cars continued to be assembled on the same assembly lines. In 1963 both Ford Falcon compacts and full-size Fords were assembled at Los Angeles in addition to Mercury Comets. For 1964 and 1965, Pico Rivera/Los Angeles assembled full- size Fords and the compact Mercury Comet. This pattern would continue until the end of the 1967 model year. For 1968 the Los Angeles plant assembled both full-size Ford cars as well as Thunderbirds and continued to build these two lines through the end of 1971 model year. Throughout the 1970's, Pico Rivera continued to produce full size Fords up through the end of the 1978 model year. For the 1979 model year Ford's Fairmont and Mercury's Zephyr passenger cars were assembled at Los Angeles and would continue with these two models up until the final car was assembled in July 1979. Ford closed its Los Angeles Assembly plant at Pico Rivera on January 31, 1980, as part of a corporate-wide elimination of regional assembly plants, in an ongoing effort to streamline production by shifting assembly to factories situated closer to suppliers, transport links, and customers.New York Times, \\"Ford To Close Last West Coast Plant\\", The New York Times, 11-19-1982 Northrop Corporation After closure, the plant was then purchased by Northrop Corporation in 1982 where they established their \\"Advanced Systems Division,\\" which was a cover for the development of the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit stealth bomber.

Music in the cathedral and churches The organ of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris The most famous organ in Paris is that of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris. It was made in the 18th century by the noted builder François-Henri Clicquot. Some of Clicquot's original pipework in the pedal division continues to sound from the organ today. The organ was almost completely rebuilt and expanded in the 19th century by Aristide Cavaillé-Coll. The position of titular organist (\\"head\\" or \\"chief\\" organist) at Notre-Dame is one of the most prestigious organist posts in France, along with the post of titular organist of Saint Sulpice in Paris, Cavaillé-Coll's largest instrument. The organ has 7,374 pipes, with ca 900 classified as historical. It has 110 real stops, five 56-key manuals and a 32-key pedalboard. In December 1992, a two-year restoration of the organ was completed that fully computerized the organ under three LANs (Local Area Networks). The restoration also included a number of additions, notably two further horizontal reed stops en chamade in the Cavaille-Coll style. The Notre-Dame organ is therefore unique in France in having five fully independent reed stops en chamade. The organ of the church of St-Gervais-et-St-Protais, played by generations of the Couperin family The church of St-Gervais-et-St-Protais is one of the great shrines of organ music, thanks to the Couperin family; eight members of the family were organists there from 1656 until 1826. They included Louis Couperin (1626-1661), and François Couperin (1668-1733) authors of celebrated masses and other compositions for the instrument. The grand organ of Couperin is still in place on the Tribune above the entrance at the back of the church. The first organ was constructed by Mathis Languhedul of Flanders in 1601; followed by new organ made by the French dynasty of Pierre, Alexandre and François Thierry, between 1649 and 1714; then rebuilt by François-Henri Cliquot in 1769, with many restorations over the following years. The organ itself is a registered historic landmark.Sources Vives, L'èglise Saint- Gervais, pages 119-123 Another well-known organ in Paris is the organ of the American Cathedral in Paris on Avenue George V. Built in 1887 by the prestigious French firm Aristide Cavaillé-Coll, it was inaugurated on October 5, 1887, by Alexandre Guilmant. It has been suggested that Marcel Dupré is the person most responsible for the evolution of the instrument, which is still one of the largest in Paris: it was Dupré who acted as consultant, first in 1922, again in 1930, then again in the 1950s, with Maurice Duruflé. The latest restoration was completed in 1993 by the organ firm of Bernard Dargassies with the generous support of the Paulé Foundation and other Cathedral members. The organ was re-dedicated on February 21, 1993, and re-inaugurated on May 18, 1993, by Marie-Madeleine Duruflé, and on May 30, 1993, by Marilyn Keiser. African-American gospel musicians are well known in Paris and some of them have taken permanent residence here. Many churches in Paris host free concerts on Sunday afternoons. A few well-known examples include the Sunday \\"Les Dimanches Musicaux\\" concertshttp://www.lagv.org/fr/dimanches-musicaux at the American Cathedral in Paris, an English speaking church located on Avenue George V, and similar programs at other churches around Paris including La Madeleine.http://www.concerts-lamadeleine.com/ The Opéra-Comique The Opéra-Comique theater has a long and illustrious history; founded in 1753, it hosted the first performances of Bizet's Carmen and of Pelléas et Mélisande by Claude Debussy, and the French premieres of the operas of Puccini.

The building was closed in 2015 for eighteen months of extensive renovations. Musical theater Musical theater became very popular in Paris in the mid-19th century, largely because of the witty and well-crafted musical works of Jacques Offenbach, but the genre nearly disappeared in the 20th century, due in large part to high costs and to competition from motion pictures. In the 1980s and 1990s, Paris reversed the trend hosted the premieres of two mega-musicals, Les Miserables, based on the novel by Victor Hugo, with music by Claude-Michel Schönberg and original French lyrics by Alain Boublil and Jean-Marc Natel, opened in Paris in 1980, and Notre Dame de Paris, also based on a novel by Victor Hugo, with music composed by Riccardo Cocciante and lyrics by Luc Plamondon, which opened on September 16, 1998. Both musicals started in Paris and went on to success in London, New York and around the world. Today the main venue for musicals is the Théatre du Châtelet, which regularly brings Broadway musicals from New York to Paris. In 2015, the musical An American in Paris was previewed first at the Chatelet before going to New York for a successful run. The theater is presenting Passion by Stephen Sondheim in its 2016 season Music halls The Moulin Rouge The music hall was first imported to Paris from London in 1862, and became enormously popular, with dancers, singers, acrobats, magicians trained animals.

Olympia Music Hall The Olympia, founded in 1893, in 1911 became the first music hall to stage its shows on a huge stairway. The Moulin Rouge, Folies-Bergere and Casino de Paris continue to present spectacular musical reviews, though their clientele now is mainly tourists. The Olympia Music Hall has been transformed into a concert hall, presenting well-known singers and bands. A few new music halls have appeared, including the Crazy Horse Saloon, which feature music and chorus lines of dancers. Bal-musette Bal-musette is a style of French music and dance that first became popular in Paris in the 1870s and 1880s; by 1880 Paris had some 150 dance halls in the working-class neighbourhoods of the city. Patrons danced the bourrée to the accompaniment of the cabrette (a bellows-blown bagpipe locally called a \\"musette\\") and often the vielle à roue (hurdy-gurdy) in the cafés and bars of the city. French and Italian musicians who played the accordion adopted the style and established themselves in Auvergnat bars, especially in the 19th arrondissement,. It evolved into several different musical and dance styles, i tango-musette, pas-musette, and valse-musette, all designed to be danced by partners close together in a small space. Its popularity declined after World War ii, faced with competition from rock and roll and other forms of entertainment. A few jazz and dance clubs present the music, and a few authentic balls are still held in the neighborhoods of the city. One club, the Vieux Belleville at 12 rue des Envierges in the 20th arrondissement, is devoted to reviving Bal-Musette music and dancing.

Music schools A concert in the Salle Cortot of the École Normale de Musique de Paris The city of Paris has several important academic institutions devoted to musical education. The first and most famous is the Conservatoire de Paris, founded in 1795 shortly after the French Revolution, formally known as the Conservatoire national supérieur de musique et de danse de Paris or CNSMDP. It was the first state music conservatory in Europe; famous students and faculty included composers Hector Berlioz, Maurice Ravel, Gabriel Fauré, Claude Debussy and Nadia Boulanger.

Virtually all of the main dancers of the Paris ballet are graduates of the school. In 1987 the ballet school was relocated from the Opera house to the suburb of Nanterre. The Schola Cantorum de Paris was founded in 1896 as a rival to the Conservatory; it put an emphasis on technique, and on the study of late Baroque and early Classical works, Gregorian chant, and Renaissance polyphony. Famous students included composers Darius Milhaud, Olivier Messiaen and Albert Roussel. The school is located in a former convent in the 5th arrondissement.

[Onlinefassung]; URL: http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/pnd118685600.html http://bsbndb.bsb.lrz- muenchen.de/sfz14010.html Life Very little is known about his life before 1524. It is speculated that Conrad Faber von Kreuznach served as a draftsman and illustrator for the publisher Peter Schöffer who was a former employee of Johannes Gutenberg. The first recorded mention of Conrad Kreuznach is found dating from 1526 where he is mentioned as a journeyman in the workshop of Hans Fyoll from Frankfurt. At the beginning of the Reformation just like many other artists deprived of their main source of income, Faber experienced a debt ridden life with modest commissioned works. Nothing is known about his first marriage. His second marriage was on 18 July 1537 to Catherine, a daughter of a wool weaver. Catherine was a citizen of Frankfurt and Faber got the citizenship of Frankfurt on 27 March 1538 because of his marriage to Catherine. In 1546 Faber's only son Louis was born. His son was named after the child's godfather Martorff Ludwig, whose portrait by Faber is included as part of his Frankfurt works. In his later years Faber created several significant topographical works including the template view of Frankfurt in Sebastian Münster's Cosmographia (1550) Münster, Sebastian: (PDF; 2,2 MB) Cosmographei Oder beschreibung aller länder, herschafften, fürnemsten stetten, geschichten, gebreuche, hantierungen etc. Ietz zum drittem mal trefflich sere durch Sebastianum Munsterum gemeret vnd gebessert ..., Basel 1550, S. 816/17 Faber died probably around the spring of 1553. He left with 400 guilders debt, while for all his extensive works on the plan of the city Frankfurt am Main his widow was paid only 50 guilders by the city council. Catherine married Faber's fellow painter Jacob Laßmann on 6 November 1553 while she sent her seven-year-old son Louis for further education to her step father and her mother in northern Hesse. Catherine died in 1558 while her son Louis was thirteen years old. He inherited his father Conrad Faber's works and house and debts. Works Conrad Faber von Kreuznach's early works include illustrations that were published by the publisher Peter Schöffer between 1517-1522. In the 420 pages of the issue there are 153 Faber woodcuts and collaborations with other fellow workers for 250 pictures. Faber's works stand out as lively illustrations. Faber used sketches of Middle Rhine and Rhineland cities that he had made during his travels to make illustrations of ancient Greek Sieges while he depicted Princes of his time as ancient Roman warlords. A large number of the paintings by Conrad Faber are portraits of wealthy clients and also Landscapes and Cityscapes. He depicted the costumes of patrons with lavish and colourful detail. His paintings were signed as 'CVC' (Conrad von Creuznach). Conrad Faber von Kreuznach is particularly noted for his 1535 portrait works of Gilbrecht von Holzhausen and his wife Anna Ratzeburger. In the background of this picture the city of Frankfurt am Main is depicted with a bird's eye perspective. This makes the picture one of the earliest known depiction of the city. His main work include the portrait of Justinian and Anna von Holzhausen (1536). In 1547 he designed a tapestry for Ogier von Melem the grandson of Johann von Melem. His last work is a woodcut depicting Frankfurt during the siege of 1552.

Description The analogy can be described like this: *Philosophy is like being in a dark room and looking for a black cat. *Metaphysics is like being in a dark room and looking for a black cat that isn't there. *Theology is like being in a dark room and looking for a black cat that isn't there, and shouting \\"I found it!\\" *Science is like being in a dark room looking for a black cat while using a flashlight. *Social Science is like being in a dark room suspecting from the beginning that there is a black cat somewhere, and emerging from the room with scratches on the forearm as vindication. It can also be applied to other bodies of knowledge or learning, for example by Ernest Gellner to Marxism. Explanation Vincent Barry explains the difference between philosophy and theology as lying in the fact that philosophy is scientific and open-minded, concerned with proof, while theologians \\"have found their final truth\\" before they begin the search. Origin Many variations on the analogy exist, and they have been variously attributed to several famous figures at different times (e.g. misquotations of Charles Darwin), but the quotation has been around since at least the 1890s. Its absolute origin is unknown. Wendy Doniger relates it to a French and English proverb: \\"In the dark, all cats are grey.\\" Hegel criticised naive ideas of the Absolute, which he ridiculed as \\"like a night, as people say, in which all cows are black.\\" Dashiell Hammett in The Dain Curse (1929) referred to a \\"blind man in a dark room hunting for a black hat that wasn't there\\". Ernest Gellner referred to an East European joke about science, philosophy, and Marxism as looking for a cat in a dark room with various consequences: with science the cat is present, with philosophy absent, and with Marxism absent but found.

A second wave of people in the founding summer soon followed, and the theatre company spent the next five years establishing itself in the Atlanta improv and theatre communities. The small theater company has since achieved international recognition for original stage productions and Improvisational comedy. The current Artistic Director is Jon Carr. Lara Smith is the current Managing Director. History On June 23, 1995, Dad's Garage opened its doors at 280 Elizabeth St., a building which formerly housed celebrated theater company Actor's Express, with the comedy play Fun With Science. The company then produced the regional premiere of Eric Bogosian's subUrbia in 1996, followed by an adaptation of Cannibal! The Musical by Trey Parker and Matt Stone in the fall of 1998, a production considered a breakthrough moment for the theatre company in the Atlanta arts scene. Graham Chapman's O Happy Day had its world premiere at Dad's Garage in 2000, followed by Chapman’s Out of The Trees in 2001. In 2002, Dad’s Garage produced a play by Chicago’s Neo-Futurists, 43 Plays for 43 Presidents, which was attended by former President and First Lady Jimmy and Rosalyn Carter. In the early and mid-2000’s, Dad’s Garage produced original new works, including premieres of several plays by Steve Yockey, during his time as Marketing Director. In the late 2000’s, the company started shifting to creating original scripted works and improv, while adopting a democratic system of preparing projects for season planning, though external scripts were still occasionally produced. In the fall of 2010, Dad's Garage secured permission to produce Two Gentlemen of Lebowski, an Elizabethan adaptation of the Coen brothers' film. A video producing wing, Dad’s Garage TV (DGTV), was established in 2011 and continues to produce shorts and web series. In 2013, the property where Dad’s Garage rented their theatre went up for sale, and the company began a two-year period of producing without their own facility. With all its property in storage, the company rented performance space at 7 Stages Theatre, Fabrefaction Theatre (now Brady Street Theatre), and The Alliance Theatre’s Hertz Stage. Dad’s Garage led a very successful fundraising campaign to purchase and renovate an old church that went up for sale when its congregation outgrew the space. The new Dad’s Garage Theatre on Ezzard St. opened its doors on December 31, 2015. Over the following five years, Dad’s Garage continued to produce scripted and improvised plays year-round, as well as expanded its educational offerings with Improv Classes for adults and the creation of a Youth Program for Improv. In January 2020, Dad’s Garage artistic leadership changed hands when Artistic Director Kevin Gillese transitioned to Executive Producer for DGTV, and Ensemble Member and Playwright Jon Carr was hired as the new Artistic Director following a national search. Most recently, Dad’s Garage responded to shutdowns due to the Covid-19 global pandemic by pivoting to live streaming content online.

The series consists of three main titles, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair, Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony, and a third person shooter spin-off, Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls. Multiple smartphone titles, as well as various manga and novel adaptations and spin-off series, have also been released, and two anime television series, Danganronpa: The Animation and Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School, have been produced by Lerche. The games are published in North America and Europe by NIS America. The series' name is a compound of and . The series follows groups of high school students who are forced into a killing game. The series received positive reviews from critics, praising the series' characters, tone, and atmosphere.  Premise  The series revolves around the elite high school, , which, every year, selects talented high school students who are in the top of their field, along with one \\"Ultimate Lucky Student\\" who is chosen by lottery. In Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, Makoto Naegi, an average student selected to join Hope's Peak Academy, arrives at the school only to lose consciousness and later find himself trapped inside the school, along with fourteen other students. There, a sadistic remote-controlled bear by the name of Monokuma announces that the students will be forced to live in the school forever, offering only one way to graduate: murder another student and get away with it. When a crime scene is discovered, a is held, in which the remaining students must discuss amongst themselves who the murderer is. If they can successfully figure out who murdered the victim, the culprit alone will be executed. However, if they guess incorrectly, the culprit will be able to leave the school and everyone else will be executed. The sequel, Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair, has a similar premise, this time taking place on a tropical island known as . Hajime Hinata, a student who has no memory of his Ultimate talent, along with fifteen other students, are taken there by a rabbit named Usami, who states it to be a field trip to help the classmates make friends with each other. However, Monokuma interferes yet again, turning it into yet another killing game. Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls, which takes place between the events of the first two games, follows Makoto's younger sister, Komaru Naegi, accompanied by Toko Fukawa, as both of them trek through a city ruled by Monokuma's influence, fighting against a group of murderous children calling themselves the Warriors of Hope. The anime series, Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School, serves as both a prologue and an epilogue to the Hope's Peak Academy storyline featured in the above games. The series is split into two arcs: Despair Side, which is a prequel to Trigger Happy Havoc, and Future Side, which is a sequel to Goodbye Despair. In Despair Side, Hope's Peak alumna Chisa Yukizome accepts a position as a homeroom teacher at her alma mater in order to keep an eye on suspicious activities undertaken by the school. In Future Side, Makoto, along with survivors of the first killing game and members of the Future Foundation, are forced into another killing game against each other. Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony features a new storyline and features two protagonists, Kaede Akamatsu and Shuichi Saihara. They become trapped in the \\"Ultimate Academy for Gifted Juveniles\\" and forced to participate in a killing game by Monokuma and his \\"Monokubs\\". This sequel is only loosely related to the Hope's Peak Academy storyline, as it happens in the future.  Gameplay  Gameplay in the main Danganronpa games is split into three main sections: Daily Life, Deadly Life, and Class Trial. Daily follows a standard visual novel style as players explore the school grounds, converse with characters and move the story forward. During designated 'Free Time' sections, players can choose to interact with a character of their choice, learning more about them and earning new skills that can help them in the Class Trial. Deadly life is the post-murder investigation part of the story, in which you have to search around certain rooms and gather clues for the Class Trial. The Class Trial is the main gameplay mode of the series, in which students discuss amongst themselves who the culprit is. This involves various different types of mini-games, the most common of which is the Nonstop Debate. Here, characters will automatically discuss the case, and it is up to the player to spot contradictions in their statements and shoot them using \\"Truth Bullets\\" containing the corresponding evidence. Other gameplay types include shooting letters to spell out a clue, using rhythmic button presses to argue against a specific character, and constructing a comic strip depicting the events of a murder. Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls, unlike the main games, is a third-person shooter in which the protagonist, Komaru, uses a megaphone to issue commands at most of electronic objects in game, including Monokuma Robots and switches. Danganronpa: Unlimited Battle is an action game where players use touchscreen controls to fling a team of four of the Danganronpa characters at enemies.  Development  The first game in the series, titled Danganronpa: Kibō no Gakuen to Zetsubō no Kōkōsei, was produced by Yoshinori Terasawa, who was inspired by movies such as Saw and Cube. The game uses a distinct \\"pop art\\" style featuring fluorescent pink blood. The game's scenario was written by Kazutaka Kodaka, with character designs by Rui Komatsuzaki. In February 2014, Kodaka revealed on his Twitter account that the story of Danganronpa was inspired by the Sega Dreamcast game Illbleed, as he loved how \\"crazy\\" it was.

The game was originally released on PlayStation Portable in Japan on 25 November 2010, and was later ported to iOS and Android devices on 20 August 2012.

Formal hostilities date back to 1785, though elements of the conflict can be traced back considerably further. The Russian Empire initially had little interest in the North Caucasus itself other than as a communication route to its ally the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti (eastern Georgia) and its enemies, the Persian and Ottoman Empires, but growing tensions triggered by Russian activities in the region resulted in an uprising of Chechens against the Russian presence in 1785, followed by further clashes and the outbreak of the Caucasian War in 1817. Russia officially won against the imamate in 1864 but only succeeded in defeating the Chechen forces in 1877. During the Russian Civil War, Chechens and other Caucasian nations lived in independence for a few years before being Sovietized in 1921. In 1944 on the grounds of dubious allegations of widespread collaboration with the advancing German forces, the Chechen nation as a collective were forcefully transferred to Central Asia in an act of ethnic cleansing. The most recent conflict between the Chechen and the Russian government took place in the 1990s. As the Soviet Union disintegrated, the Chechen separatists declared independence in 1991. By late 1994 the First Chechen War broke out and after two years of fighting the Russian forces withdrew from the region in December 1996. In 1999, the fighting restarted resulting in yet another major armed conflict culminating in a large number of casualties on both sides with vast destruction of the Chechen capital in the Battle of Grozny that saw the Russian military establishing control over Grozny in early February 2000 officially ending the war with insurgency and hostilities continuing in various forms and to varying degrees since. Origins The North Caucasus, a mountainous region that includes Chechnya, spans or lies close to important trade and communication routes between Russia and the Middle East, control of which have been fought over by various powers for millennia. Russia's entry into the region followed Tsar Ivan the Terrible's conquest of the Golden Horde's Khanates of Kazan and Astrakhan in 1556, initiating a long struggle for control of the North Caucasus routes with other contemporary powers including Persia, the Ottoman Empire and the Crimean Khanate. During the 16th century the Russian Tsardom tried to win influence in the North Caucasus by allying themselves with local princes such as the Temryuk of Kabarda and Shikh-Murza Okotsky of Chechnya. Temryuk controlled the Northwest Caucasus and with Russia's help he managed to stave off Crimean incursions. Northeast Caucasus was largely controlled by Shamkhal princes, Avar Khans and the powerful Okotsky lord Shikh-Murza who's influence reached all of Northeast Caucasus. These princes bought weapons and settled Russian Cossacks near the Terek to strengthen their rule and influence. Shikh-Murza Okotsky had in his army around 500 Cossacks combined with 1000 Okocheni (Aukh Chechens), and often waged anti-Iranian and anti-Ottoman campaigns in Dagestan. Shikh-Murza's politics gave the Russian Tsardom more influence in the Northeast Caucasus, several Russian forts were set up along the Terek river (among them the stronghold of Terki) and Cossack villages. Prior to this the Cossacks had almost no presence in Chechnya and Dagestan. These villages and forts caused Chechens to distrust Shikh-Murza since forts were built on Chechen owned pastures. The Michkizi (lowland Chechens) and part of the Okoki (Aukh Chechens) that were loyal to the Chechen Mullah Mayda joined the outcast Kumyk prince Sultan-Mut who for a very long time allied with the Chechens living south of the Terek-Sulak interfluve. Sultan-Mut was at first against the Russian policies in the Caucasus, he along with the Chechens, Kumyks and Avars fought Russian Cossacks and burn down Russian forts. The Russian Tsar countered this by sending military expeditions into Dagestan, all 2 of these expeditions resulted in Russian defeat and culminated in the Battle of the Karaman Field where a Dagestani-Chechen army under Sultan-Mut defeated the Russian army. These failed expeditions and battles by Russia led to the weakening of Prince Shikh-Murza and his assassination in 1596 by one of Sultan-Mut's brothers. Sultan-Mut continued to pursue an anti-Russian policy into the early 17th century and was known to sometimes live among the Chechens and with them raid the Russian Cossacks. However this started to change as Sultan-Mut several times tried to join the Russians and asked for a Citizenship. This switch of policy angered many Chechens and led to them distancing from Sultan-Mut. This caused a mistrust in Aukh between Endireyans (Chechen-Kumyk city controlled by the Sultan-Mut family and his Chechen Sala- Uzden allies) and the Aukh Chechens.\\" In 1774, Russia gained control of Ossetia, and with it the strategically important Darial Pass, from the Ottomans. A few years later, in 1783, Russia signed the Treaty of Georgievsk with Heraclius II (Erekle) of the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti, making the eastern Georgian Kingdom—a Christian enclave surrounded by hostile Muslim states—a Russian protectorate. To fulfill her obligations under the treaty, Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia, began construction of the Georgian Military Road through the Darial Pass, along with a series of military forts to protect the route. These activities, however, antagonized the Chechens, who saw the forts both as an encroachment on the traditional territories of the mountaineers and as a potential threat. Chechen conflict with the Russian Empire =Sheikh Mansur uprising and aftermath, 1785–1794= Around this time, Sheikh Mansur, a Chechen imam, began preaching a purified version of Islam and encouraging the various mountain peoples of the North Caucasus to unite under the banner of Islam in order to protect themselves from further foreign encroachments. His activities were seen by the Russians as a threat to their own interests in the region, and in 1785, a force was sent to capture him. Failing to do so, it burned his unoccupied home village instead, but the force was ambushed by Mansur's followers on its return journey and annihilated, beginning the first Chechen–Russian war. The war lasted several years, with Mansur employing mostly guerilla tactics and the Russians conducting further punitive raids on Chechen villages, until Mansur's capture in 1791. Mansur died in captivity in 1794. In 1801, Russia formally annexed eastern Georgia, deepening Russia's commitment to the region. In subsequent years, number of small-scale raids and ambushes by Chechen fighters on Russian forces moving through the Caucasus grew, this was due to fertile lands previously belonging to Chechens were aggressively being settled by Cossacks. This prompted Russians to mount two substantial military expeditions into Chechen territory, both of which were defeated, and Russian leaders began considering more drastic measures. These were postponed however by Napoleon's 1812 invasion of Russia. =Caucasian and Crimean Wars, 1817–64= After Russia's defeat of French Napoleonic forces in the 1812 war, Tsar Alexander I turned his attentions once more to the North Caucasus, assigning one of his most celebrated generals, Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov, to the conquest of the region. In 1817, Russian forces under Yermolov's command embarked upon the conquest of the Caucasus. Yermolov's brutal tactics, which included economic warfare, collective punishment and forcible deportations, were initially successful, but have been described as counterproductive since they effectively ended Russian influence on Chechen society and culture and ensured the Chechens' enduring enmity. Yermolov was not relieved of command until 1827. A turning point in the conflict was marked in 1828 when the Muridism movement emerged. It was led by Imam Shamil, a Dagestani Avar. In 1834 he united the Northeast Caucasus nations under Islam and declared \\"holy war\\" on Russia. In 1845 Shamil's forces surrounded and killed thousands of Russian soldiers and several generals in Dargo, forcing them to retreat. During the Crimean War of 1853–6, the Chechens supported the Ottoman Empire against Russia. However, internal tribal conflicts weakened Shamil and he was captured in 1859. The war formally ended in 1862 when Russia promised autonomy for Chechnya and other Caucasian ethnic groups. However, Chechnya and the surrounding region, including northern Dagestan, were incorporated into Russia as the Terek Oblast. Some Chechens have perceived Shamil's surrender as a betrayal, thus created friction between Dagestanis and Chechens in this conflict, with the Dagestanis being frequently accused by Chechens as Russian collaborators. Russian Civil War and Soviet period After the Russian Revolution, the peoples of the North Caucasus came to establish the Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus. It existed until 1921, when they were forced to accept Soviet rule. Joseph Stalin personally held negotiations with the Caucasian leaders in 1921 and promised a wide autonomy inside the Soviet state. The Mountain Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was created that year, but only lasted until 1924 when it was abolished and six republics were created. The Chechen–Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was established in 1934. Confrontations between the Chechens and the Soviet government arose in the late 1920s during collectivization. It declined by the mid-1930s after local leaders were arrested or killed. The broke out in early 1932 and was defeated in march. =Ethnic cleansing of Chechens from their homeland= Statue of Aleksey Yermolov in Grozny (ru) with one of his quotes in reference to Chechens: \\"There is no people more vile and insidious under the sun.\\" The statue was reinstated in 1949, four years after the Chechens were ethnically cleansed from their homeland, and it stood until 1989. In modern times Yermolov has been accused of genocide. Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. Soviet historiography falsely accuses Chechens of joining the Wehrmacht en masse, although this notion is not accepted in any other academic instances. Modern Russian historiography itself also admits that there is little merit to these accusations. By January 1943, the German retreat started, while the Soviet government began discussing the deportation of Chechen and Ingush people far from the North Caucasus, this was despite the fact Chechens and Ingush served in the Red Army like any other of the nations in the Soviet Union. In February 1944, under the direct command of Lavrentiy Beria, almost half million Chechens and Ingush were removed from their homes and forcibly settled in Central Asia in an act of ethnic cleansing. They were put in forced labor camps in Kazakhstan and Kirghizia. Estimates on casualties range from 170,000 up to 200,000, some evidence also indicates that 400,000 people perished, the victims perished mostly due to hypothermia(freezing to death) and starvation, although massacres were not uncommon. The most notable of the massacres during the deportation was the Khaibakh massacre, in which an estimated 700 Chechen children, elderly and women were locked in a barn and burned alive, reportedly due to problems with their transportation. Mikhail Gvishiani, the officer responsible for the massacre was praised and promised a medal by Lavrentiy Beria himself. Many scholars recognize the deportation as an act of genocide, as did the European Parliament in 2004. =Ethnic clashes (1958–65)= In 1957, Chechens were allowed to return to their homes. The Chechen–Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was reestablished. The violence began in 1958, upon a conflict between a Russian sailor and an Ingush youngster over a girl, in which the Russian was fatally injured. The incident quickly deteriorated into mass ethnic riots, as Slavic mobs attacked Chechens and Ingushes and looted their property throughout the region for 4 days.Seely, R. Russo-Chechen conflict, 1800–2000: A Deadly Embrace. Frank Cass Publishers. 2001. Ethnic clashes continued through 1960s, and in 1965 some 16 clashes were reported, taking tall of 185 severe injuries, 19 of them fatal. By late 1960, the region calmed down and the Chechen–Russian conflict came to its lowest point until the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the eruption of Chechen Wars in 1990. Post-Soviet era =Chechen Wars= A Chechen fighter with a Borz submachine gun, 1995 In 1991, Chechnya declared independence and was named the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. According to some sources, from 1991 to 1994, tens of thousands of people of non-Chechen ethnicity (mostly Russians, Ukrainians and Armenians) left the republic amidst reports of violence and discrimination against the non-Chechen population. Other sources do not identify displacement as a significant factor in the events of the period, instead focussing on the deteriorating domestic situation within Chechnya, the aggressive politics of the Chechyen President, Dzhokhar Dudayev, and the domestic political ambitions of Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Russian Army forces were commanded into Grozny in 1994 but, after two years of intense fighting, the Russian troops eventually withdrew from Chechnya under the Khasavyurt Accord. Chechnya preserved its de facto independence until the second war broke out in 1999. In 1999, the Russian government forces started an anti-terrorist campaign in Chechnya, in response to the invasion of Dagestan by Chechen-based Islamic forces. By early 2000 Russia almost completely destroyed the city of Grozny and succeeded in putting Chechnya under direct control of Moscow by late April. Akhmad Kadyrov (right), formerly a leading separatist mufti, had switched sides in 2000 =Chechen insurgency= Since the end of the Second Chechen War in May 2000, low-level insurgency has continued, particularly in Chechnya, Ingushetia and Dagestan. Russian security forces have succeeded in eliminating some of their leaders, such as Shamil Basayev, who was killed on July 10, 2006. After Basayev's death, Dokka Umarov took the leadership of the rebel forces in North Caucasus until his death owing to poisoning in 2013. Radical Islamists from Chechnya and other North Caucasian republics have been held responsible for a number of terrorist attacks throughout Russia, most notably the Russian apartment bombings in 1999, the Moscow theater hostage crisis in 2002, the Beslan school hostage crisis in 2004, the 2010 Moscow Metro bombings and the Domodedovo International Airport bombing in 2011. Currently, Chechnya is now under the rule of its Russian-appointed leader: Ramzan Kadyrov. Though the oil-rich region has maintained relative stability under Mr. Kadyrov, he has been accused by critics and citizens of suppressing freedom of the press and violating other political and human rights. Because of this continued Russian rule, there have been minor guerilla attacks by separatist groups in the area. Further adding to the tension, jihadist groups aligned with the Islamic State and Al-Qaeda exist in the region. Outside Russia The conflict between Chechens and Russians are also seen outside the Russian border. During the Syrian Civil War, Chechen fighters that remain loyal to the collapsed Chechen Republic of Ichkeria and radical Chechen Islamists had also fought against Russian Army and its ally Bashar al-Assad in Syria, with desire to overthrow the Assad Government and replacing it by a more Chechen-sympathized government.https://www.refworld.org/docid/50bf3c772.htmlhttp://newcaucasus.com/in- english/18201-ali-ash-shishani-like-all-chechens-in-syria-i-miss-chechnya.html In 2016, Poland, a country which has a history of conflict and tension with Russia, banned Chechen refugees from entering Poland, in a policy to \\"protect European Union from Islamist terrorism\\"; Polish interior minister Mariusz Błaszczak had even gone further, blasting the Chechen refugees as dangerous due to its Islamic belief.https://www.dw.com/en/poland-slams-door-on- chechnyan-refugees/a-19516827 Poland had already sent back over 78,000 Chechen refugees to Russia in 2016, which was an increase comparing to 18,000 Chechens being denied entry in 2015; as for 2019, the policy had not been reversed.https://www.dw.com/en/chechens-waiting-at-europes- door/a-36766809https://jam-news.net/how-and-why-chechen-refugees-are-storming- the-polish-border-with-belarus/ The policy of Poland was criticized for being Chechenophobic and supportive of Russia's oppression on Chechens.https://polandin.com/49152700/strasbourg-rules-against-poland-over- chechen-migrants Casualties The exact casualties of this conflict are difficult to ascertain due to lack of records and the long time period of the clashes. One source indicates that at least 60,000 Chechens were killed in the First and Second Chechen War in the 1990s and 2000s alone. High estimates of these two wars range of up to 150,000 or 160,000 killed, as put by Taus Djabrailov, the head of Chechnya's interim parliament.

Daley win election to the remainder of an unexpired mayoral term with a 14% margin of victory. This marked a return for the Daley family to the office of mayor. Daley was elected over Alderman Timothy Evans, the nominee of the newly formed Harold Washington Party, and the Republican nominee Ed Vrdolyak.http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=123283 The election was held two years earlier than the next regularly scheduled mayoral election due of the death in office of Harold Washington. Eugene Sawyer had been appointed Mayor by the City Council to serve until the special election. He was unseated by Daley in the Democratic primary. Background A lawsuit was filed by an anti-Sawyer coalition of black activists and several Harold Washington supporters demanding a special election be held as soon as possible. On May 5, 1989, Eugene Wachowski, judge of the Cook County Circuit Court, argued that a special election would be required to be held in 1989 on the basis of three previous rulings by Circuit, Appellate, and Supreme Court judges and by a 1978 legislative debate from when the Illinois General Assembly passed the then-current election law. Nominations =Democratic primary= Richard M. Daley won the Democratic primary, defeating Eugene Sawyer, who had been appointed mayor by City Council following the death of Harold Washington.

Evans, aldermanhttps://app.chicagoelections.com/documents/Electoral- Board/document_1475.PDF *Juan Solizhttps://app.chicagoelections.com/documents/Electoral- Board/document_1464.PDF Campaign While Daley was considered a poor public speaker, and sometimes a timid campaigner, he ran an effective campaign. In 1983, he was widely viewed merely as the son of the former mayor Richard J. Daley. In 1987, he had crafted an image of a strong public administrator. Daley's campaign was run by two young consultants that had previously worked on Paul Simon's 1984 United States Senate campaign, David Wilhelm and David Axelrod. His deputy campaign manager was Julie Hamos. His fundraising was headed by John Schmidt and Paul Stepan. Avis LaVelle served as his campaign press spokesperson. One of Sawyer's first missteps was his choice for campaign leadership. Sawyer's campaign was managed by Louisiana political consultant Reynard Rochon. Rochon, being an outsider to Chicago politics, did not understand many important aspects of it. Additionally, Rochon spent much of his time managing campaign doing so remotely from New Orleans. Sawyer was able to raise significant funds for his candidacy. Sawyer was a low-key individual, one to eschew interviews. A media consultant was brought from Boston to film campaign commercial's for Sawyer. Most of the ads filled were positive ads, highlighting the accomplishments of Sawyers brief tenure. However, there were a few ads which attacked Daley, portraying him as stupid and unable to complete a sentence on his own. The campaign overspent on media advertising, while failing to spend enough on literature, field operations, and lawn signs. Sawyer's campaign lacked a strong field operation. The African-American anti-Sawyer faction, members of which were responsible for the lawsuit which led to the special election being ordered, rallied around Evans, who they viewed as the proper heir to Harold Washington's political legacy. Evans' allies criticized Sawyer, such as Dorothy Tillman, who called the mayor an \\"Uncle Tom\\". In addition to Tillman, another alderman in Evans' camp was Bobby Rush. In July 1988, after months of attacks on him, Sawyer retaliated in July 1988 by stripping them of their committee chairmanships in a City Council restructuring. African American support was reported to be split between Sawyer and Evans before the latter was taken off of the ballot. Sawyer attempted to broker a deal to get Evans to willingly withdraw from the primary. This was to no avail. However, in a stroke of luck for Sawyer, Evans was ultimately removed from the ballot. In December, Edward M. Burke withdrew from the race and endorsed Daley. Just under two weeks before the day of the primary, alderman Lawrence S. Bloom withdrew his candidacy and endorsed Sawyer. Bloom had entered the race in September 1988, and had originally started his campaign near the front of the pack, benefiting from what the press referred to as a \\"squeaky clean\\" reputation.https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/lawrence-bloom-for- mayor/Content?oid=872933 During the campaign, Daley and sawyer avoided lodging personal attacks, and each called for racial harmony. Endorsements Results Daley won a majority of the vote in 31 of the city's 50 wards, with Sawyer winning a majority of the vote in the remaining 19 wards. ;Results by ward { class=\\"wikitable collapsible collapsed sortable\\" ! rowspan=2Ward !! colspan=2Richard M.

The decrease was even more pronounced in black neighborhoods than it had been in white neighborhoods. According to a The New York Times—WBBM-TV poll found that Daley received 91% of the white vote, to Sawyers 8%. It found, in contrast, that Sawyer received 94% of the black vote, to Daley's 5%. The poll also found that Jewish and Hispanic voters, who Sawyer had hoped to capture the support of, had strongly went for Daley. It found that Daley got 83% of the Jewish vote, to Sawyer's 15%. It also found that Daley got 84% of the Hispanic vote, to Sawyer's 15%. Additionally, the poll found that three-fourths of whites that had previously voted for Harold Washington voted for Daley. =Republican primary= Candidates *William J.

Pohjanen retired from football aged 27 to start a new career as a pop singer. She released her debut album \\"Better Things To Do\\" in December 2001, then went on tour in 2002. She then moved into television punditry and worked for Sveriges Television on their football coverage. Pohjanen also founded a sport management company and is an advisor to several leading women's footballers in Sweden. Sveriges Television removed her from her role as a pundit in 2007, amid concerns of a potential conflict of interest. Football career Ahead of the 1998 season, Älvsjö AIK beat competition from other clubs to sign Pohjanen from Sunnanå SK, where she had spent her entire career to that point. In her first season Älvsjö secured their fourth successive Damallsvenskan title, gaining Pohjanen her first winner's medal. She won her second in 1999, when Älvsjö retained their title again. After the 2000 season, Pohjanen considered retiring from football to concentrate on her music. But she accepted a new contract from Älvsjö which allowed her to miss training for her recording sessions. She stopped playing altogether after 2001. Pohjanen later worked as an advisor to women's football players and founded a sports management firm with lawyer and former Älvsjö teammate Lotta Fridh. She was careful not to have any involvement in transfers as she was not a FIFA-registered agent. Music career Singer-songwriter Pohjanen released debut album \\"Better Things To Do\\" in December 2001 on Label This, a subsidiary of Bonnier Amigo Music Group (BAMG). It contained lyrics in English, underpinned by guitar-based soft rock. The album received a mixed critical reception; with Norrköpings Tidningar praising \\"competent\\", \\"worthy\\" pop in the PJ Harvey mould. Svenska Dagbladet's review was less complementary, suggesting that none of the songs got off the ground. The album failed to chart. Personal life In 1999 Pohjanen was in a relationship with professional National Hockey League (NHL) player Mats Lindgren.

Life Jones was born in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, and left his private school after the failure of his father's timber business. He began work as a window dresser at 16 and took classes in engineering draughtsmanship. Harsh living conditions during World War II, and a hard winter in 1942 led to Jones suffering from double pneumonia. His illness led to him leading an open air life, working in farming made him exempt from military service when he came of age. =Stage designer= Jones first entered the theatre as a member of an amateur dramatics society. His brother was already working as a music hall illusionist. In the 1940s the designer at the Players' Theatre, in London, Reginald Woolley, hired Jones as an assistant and taught him the fundamentals of scenic design, as well as painting and construction. Jones designed his first production, Twelfth Night, for the Midland Theatre Company at the College Theatre in Coventry. Jones also designed for several repertory theatres around the United Kingdom as well as the Oxford Playhouse and Bristol Old Vic. He designed his first production in London, The Seagull, at the Arts Theatre in 1953. He was also responsible for two early productions by Peter Hall, The Impresario From Smyrna and Listen to the Wind. Jones also designed Hall's 1954 production of Gigi at the New Theatre. Jones's partner, Reginald Cornish, had become the manager of the Hammersmith's Lyric Theatre in the 1950s, and Jones joined him there, designing The Dock Brief, What Shall We Tell Caroline? and Share My Lettuce in 1958, and The Demon Barber in 1959. Comedian Kenneth Williams appeared in Share My Lettuce, and was dismissive of Jones in his diary, writing \\"Disley Jones charged Bamber Gascoigne with subversion, and ordered him out of the theatre. What an incredible lot of amateurs I am among! What a crock of shit\\". While at the Lyric, Eleanor Fazan and Jones collaborated on the revue One to Another, persuading Bamber Gascoigne, John Mortimer and Harold Pinter to write lyrics for it. Jones had previously worked with Pinter on Pinter's play, The Birthday Party. Musicals Jones worked on included Anthony Newley's The Good Old Bad Old Days and Dan Farson's Nights at the Comedy. The first television production designed by Jones was All Summer Long, in 1960. Other TV productions designed by Disley included The Rehearsal, Summer's Pride, and The Teachers. Jones also worked internationally, designing Rhinoceros for the National Theatre of Iceland, as well as The Rivals and Romeo and Juliet for the Aarhus Theatre, in Denmark. Jones worked as a film production designer from the mid-1960s, working on The Long Day's Dying (1968), The Italian Job (1969), The Revolutionary (1970) and Murphy's War (1971). For the scene involving the Italian mafia on the mountainside in The Italian Job Jones recruited the \\"prettiest\\" men as extras from Turin's gay clubs. He had previously designed a production of The Mikado for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company at the Savoy Theatre, and was subsequently production designer on the 1966 film version of that comic opera.Shepherd, Marc. \\"The 1966 D'Oyly Carte Mikado Film\\", A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, 15 April 2009, accessed 16 July 2014 =Final years= Jones ran Them and Theirs, a shop in St Christopher's Place, off London's Oxford Street, which sold commemorative ceramics and picture postcards. Jones had always been a collector of memorabilia and art works. In the mid-1990s Jones succeeded the late Reginald Woolley, as the resident designer of the Players' Theatre. He redesigned the space under Charing Cross Bridge, and his annual Victorian Christmas pantomimes became notable. Soon after quitting the Players, he was diagnosed with AIDS. He was stoic upon his AIDS diagnosis, saying \\"You can hardly be surprised, the way I've carried on.\\" Jones benefitted from treatment, and returned to work, conceiving imaginative projects for films and plays, of which none were brought to fruition. Jones' partner for almost forty years was Reginald Cornish, who he met at the College Theatre in Coventry. There were together until Cornish's death in 1985. They moved to Spain in the mid-1970s, due to Cornish's health, and ran a restaurant called the Wide-Mouthed Frog in Estepona on the Costa del Sol. The restaurant attracted many of Jones's friends from showbusiness. Jones returned to the United Kingdom following Cornish's death. Jones was a regular in the French House pub in Soho, and his photograph is a fixture on the walls of the pub. His obituary in The Guardian described the lifestyle of his last years as \\"...despite no visible means of support apart from his state pension, somehow managed to live with an air of grand extravagance. Only three days before his sudden death, he had returned from a holiday in the south of France, short of cash but full of new ideas.\\" Disley spent his last years in Kennington, in sheltered housing where he planted a garden, and threw parties for his fellow-residents. Of his demeanour the Guardian said \\"Tall, unintentionally overbearing, loud- spoken and fruity in vocabulary, he was a handful\\".

It was aired on October 27, 2011. The episode was written by Michelle Lovretta and it was directed by Charles Beeson. Plot Cassie (Britt Robertson) is throwing a party for Halloween while her grandmother, Jane (Ashley Crow) is leaving to go to Henry's (Tom Butler) place, Faye's (Phoebe Tonkin) grandfather. She didn't hear from him for weeks and she is worried. Cassie and Faye are buying some decorations for the party from an old antique store and when the owner, Calvin (Hiro Kanagawa), sees Cassie's last name asks if she is related to Amelia Blake. Cassie finds out later from Jane that Calvin is also a witch but from another Circle. Before leaving the store, Faye convinces Cassie to invite Luke (Zachary Abel) to the party as her date. Later at Cassie's house, while making the set up for the party, Cassie finds a piece of the knife the witch had attacked her with in the previous episode. There are some strange symbols on it but they don't know what they mean, so Cassie decides to go back to the antique store to ask Calvin about them. On her way there, she meets Jake (Chris Zylka) outside her home and tells him about the knife. Jake immediately leaves to go to the store before Cassie and warns Calvin by threatening him, to not answer any questions Cassie will ask him. Cassie gets to the store and Calvin doesn't tell her anything. She sees though that there is an item in the store with exactly the same symbols - plus a new one - on it as the knife she has. She takes a picture of it and goes back to the shelter where she is searching to find out what these symbols mean along with Adam (Thomas Dekker). They discover that the symbols are related to witch hunters. While trying to tell Jake about it, he says something that makes Cassie suspicious. She asks Faye to occupy him during the party so she can search his house. Jake has a meeting with Isaac (JR Bourne) where he spells the five vessels (one for each member of the Circle) that will allow Isaac to kill the five witches. Isaac informs him that he won't be alone at the party. Some \\"brothers\\" will be there to drug and take the witches, one of which is Luke, who seems to be from a witch hunter family. Meanwhile, Calvin wants to warn Cassie about the magic she has inside her and about her father, John Blackwell. John seemed to be using dark magic and he is somehow connected to what happened sixteen years ago. He leaves an envelope at Cassie's home and he calls her but he doesn't get the chance to tell her anything because Jake kills him. During the party, Cassie finds a knife in Jake's room with the witch hunter symbols on it. Jake finds her there and when she asks him why he has a witch hunter knife, he says that it was Nick's. He shows her more things that Nick \\"had\\" saying that he doesn't know what Nick was doing. Meanwhile, the witch hunters are drugging all the members of the Circle one by one and taking them to a house at the deck. With all five members tied up in a circle that's not allowing them to do any magic, Luke tries to kill each of them using the vessels Jake spelled earlier. Cassie manages somehow to use magic saving everyone and killing Luke. In the meantime, Jake comes at the deck house trying to warn Isaac to stop because Cassie has dark magic and they can't kill her that way. The members of the Circle get free and find Jake outside the house hurt. He supposedly fought a witch hunter trying to get to them, but the Circle is still suspicious about him and they don't seem to trust him. The episode ends with Cassie finding the envelope Calvin left for her, which contains some strange ancient documents with the initials J.B. on them and Jane arriving at Henry's house. She finds him lying on the floor and in her attempt to help him, she gets Henry's crystal and tries to do a spell, but someone hits her on the head, takes the crystal and leaves. Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"Masked\\" was watched by 2.33 million; up 0.21 from the previous episode. =Reviews= \\"Masked\\" received positive reviews. Katherine Miller from The A.V. Club gave a B+ rate to the episode. \\"The Secret Circle’s Halloween, however, also got to be about the tension between who we inescapably are, who we want to be, and who we can pretend to be. Is Cassie Blake going to turn out like her mother, the ol’ beloved Amelia, or will she take after her black magic father? Is Jake an irredeemable psychopath or just waiting to be turned into a hero? The endgame answers seem a little obvious, but the show's treating them like legitimate questions. That's why tonight, the Secret Circle wove together some underlying, relatable questions with good suspense and ever more mystery for the best episode yet.\\" Matt Richenthal from TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.4/5 saying that it was a great episode overall. \\"This was a great episode overall, perfectly utilizing the theme of generation versus generation. It's my favorite aspect of The Secret Circle, allowing for both mystery and character development.\\" Sarah Maines from The TV Chick said that this week's episode didn't disappoint and it was a solid follow-up from the previous one. \\"Overall, this was a solid follow-up to last week’s episode and a much better introduction to Jake. A couple of really strong twists (and really fun Halloween costumes) made this a great episode. And as always, let’s finish this up with my weekly motto: More Charles and Dawn.\\" Feature music In the \\"Masked\\" episode we can hear the songs: * \\"Just A Little Bit\\" by Kids Of 88 * \\"Book Of Revelations\\" by The Drums * \\"Ready 2 Go\\" by Martin Solveig and Kele References External links  * Category:2011 American television episodes Category:The Secret Circle (TV series) episodes ","title":"Masked (The Secret Circle)"},{"id":"39886237","text":"The Ulaan Ovoo Coal Mine , red mound) is a coal mine located in the Tüshig sum of Selenge aimag in northern Mongolia.

Plot In Macau, criminal Tong Heung- tung of the Hunan Gang, who bombed the Hong Kong police headquarters, was being send back to Hong Kong by Kowloon OCTB inspectors Lee Ho-lung and Lo Mo. During the process, the police van was ambushed by the Hunan Gang who helped Tong escape. Lee chased the gang all the way past the Mainland border and arrested them causing mass destruction which maddened his superior officer Chan. Complaints Against Police Unit inspector Lau Kwok-wah is Lee's good friend. During one night while Lau, Lo Mo, Lee, his wife and daughters were dining, Lee's informant Miss Chung came for help. One of the Hunan Gang member, Wai, used Chung to lure Lee out to seek revenge for his brothers. When Lee made it to Chung's house, he fought with Wai's henchmen before being knocked out by Wai. Chung was also knocked and pretended to be unconscious and heard everything the gang said. After she got up, she left her house but the gang chased her and she mistakenly thought that she killed one of the henchmen. Wai and his gang brought Lee to the pier and brutally beat him before making him drunk and having him drive himself into the ocean, killing him. The next morning, Lee's wife, May, gave birth to a baby boy and was saddened when she heard of her husband's death. When she retrieved Lee's belongings at the police station, Lau told Chan that Lee's death was suspicious which Chan refused to believe. Lau and Lo Mo decided to investigate Lee's death and first, tries to find Lee's informant, Chung. They saw Chung crashing out of a nightclub and was harassed by narcotic officers before Lau went to the rescue. Lau and Lo Mo took Chung to a restaurant where Chung escaped. Just as expected by the two, she went to her grandmother's house where the Hunan Gang attempted to kill them by burning the house. Lau and Lo Mo came to rescue them. Lau took Chung to the police station where she told Chan that she saw Wai and his gang taking Lee, which Chan still refused to believe. Chan had his own inefficient ways to arrest the Hunan Gang and refused to let Lau interfere. Angered, Lau decided to take this case in his own hands. Lau also allowed Chung to stay in his house since she had nowhere to stay. There, Chung agreed to help Lau find the head of the Hunan Gang, Squid Chiu, when he jokingly threatened her that he would use her as bait to catch the Hunan Gang. Chung took Lau to see a low-life triad, Al, to help them get Squid Chiu to cooperate with Lau. When Al refused, Lau revealed that he had used Al's name to call Chiu and would either frame him for drug possession or that he had betrayed Chiu. Al agreed to help when Chiu arrived and told him about Lau, posing as the son of a jewelry store owner, wanting him to rob his store. Afterwards, Lau rewarded Al with what Al thought was heroin but was actually laundry detergent. When Chiu wanted to take a look at Lau's jewelry store, Lau asked Lo Mo for help to have his future father in-law lend him his store. Lo Mo's girlfriend told them that his father would not be at the store if a girl could take him out. They thought of a plan to have Chung to go out with him. Chung, who was addicted to drugs, had two heroin-laced cigarettes in her purse. Lau however threw these cigarettes down the toilet before leaving with her and encountered a traffic jam. As a result, they ran and made it to the store just on time. When Chung's addiction came while at the store, Lo Mo quickly got some methadone for her before she proceeded to leave with Lo Mo's father in-law and Chiu arrived right after. At home, Lau scolded Chung telling her that she almost foiled his plan and to stop using drugs while Chung blamed him for throwing her cigarettes away. At night, Chung cried and told Lau that it was not easy to quit drugs with no support. Lau then promised Chung that after avenging Lee, he would take her to a quiet place in Lantau Island and help her quit it. The next day, Lau gave a call to Chiu, who wanted HK$200,000 before staging the robbery. Lo Mo went to Chan for help, who refused to do so. When Chung told them that a Taiwanese drug dealer was coming to Hong Kong the next day, Lau thought of a plan to rob him. At first, the timid Lo Mo was reluctant to join before Lau told him that Lee treated him as a best friend and advised him to do it for avenging his friend, to which Lo Mo finally agreed to help. At the airport, Lau disguised with a mustache and sunglasses kidnapped the drug dealer when Lo Mo and Chung came to pick them up with a van and drove away while being chased by the police. While Lau was forcing the drug dealer out of the car as they fought, Lo Mo accidentally revealed that they were police officers. They finally got his money and left while the police were firing at them. At the OCTB headquarters, Chan told his subordinates that yesterday, Interpol Agent Chan Kwok-chiu, who was working undercover as the Taiwanese drug dealer, was robbed and suspected it was done by the police. The Interpol agent described one of them as an overweight man of 200 pounds and every 200 pound police officer in Hong Kong would be going to the Interpol headquarter for identification. Lo Mo told Lau and Chung about this and tried have him lose 10 pounds in one day by working out all day but obviously failed to do so. Later they suggested that him to speak Cantonese with a false Chiuchow accent. At the Interpol headquarters, Lo Mo successfully tricked the police by faking the accent before he was caught speaking accurate Cantonese. They called him in once again for identification before he was freed to go although they were suspicious of him. Later, Lau brought the HK$200,000 to Chiu. At night, while Lau was typing a report on the case, Chung came out and asked him why he was not sleeping yet. Lau then gave Chung a large sum of money, telling her to go to Lantau Island alone if the case was going to go on longer. She refused the money and they later go to a bar and had a drink where Chung sang a song to Lau, expressing her love to him and they later kissed outside. The next day, Lau brought Chung to the harbour to send her off to Lantau Island. Then Lo Mo came and drove Lau to the store where he would observe the robbers. Lau told Lo Mo to inform Chan about the robbery before 12:30PM. Lo Mo attempted to tell Chan about this but he was at a meeting. While Lau was inside his car, two beat cops thought he was parking illegally before he revealed his identity to them and told them to leave. When Chan's meeting was finally over, Interpol Superintendent Lai wanted to arrest Lo Mo while he was still talking to Chan. Lo Mo asked him to listen before having him arrested. Outside the jewelry store, Chung took a taxi back and wanted to help Lau. There, the Hunan Gang, led by Wai, arrived. Chung told Lau that Wai captured Lee at the night of his death. The Hunan Gang then proceeded to rob the store but the police has not arrive yet. Lau asked the two beat cops for help. Later, a big chase and gunfight occurred where Lau killed several gang members and Wai killed one of the beat cops. Lau and one of the beat cops chased Wai and two gang members as Chung followed taking the gun of the dead beat cop and during the process, Lau killed another gang member. Later, they end up at the top of a building where Lau shot another gang member and Wai killed the other beat cop. As they were shooting at each other, they ran out of bullets after each making a shot. Then they fought to get the dead beat cop's loaded gun where Wai triumphed and Chung arrived holding a gun behind Wai. However, the gang member that Lau shot came back up attempting to attack Chung when she turned around and shot him while at the same time Wai shot her as well. Lau and Wai were engaged in a fight when the police arrived at the store. Lau delivered a final kick to Wai before Lo Mo and the police arrived. When the police arrest him, Wai took a gun from a policeman and killed him while Lau took Lo Mo's gun and shot Wai multiple times, killing him. Lau later went to see Chung, who was fatally wounded. Chung told Lau that no one had cared for her as much as he had and she could not quit drugs without him. She then died in Lau's arms. Afterwards, Lau and Lo Mo were arrested for robbing Chan Kwok-chiu at the airport.

It is the second largest Portuguese university by number of enrolled students, after the University of Lisbon, and has one of the most noted research outputs in Portugal. History 249x249px The University of Porto was founded by decree of 22 March 1911, issued by the Provisional Government of the First Portuguese Republic. While it is possible to point the university's predecessors as the Nautical Academy, established by King Joseph I in 1762, and the Drawing and Sketching Academy, created by Queen Mary I in 1779, the university was to be based primarily on higher education institutions created in the nineteenth century, namely the Polytechnic Academy (1836–1911) and Medical-Surgical Academy of Porto (1836–1911). The Polytechnic Academy's main purpose was the teaching of science and industrial engineering of all kinds, and professional specialties such as naval officers, merchants, farmers, factory directors and artists. Heir to the Royal Navy and Commerce Academy of Porto, which was established in 1803 by Prince Regent John (future King John VI), it arose as a result of reforms implemented by Passos Manuel, Minister of the Kingdom in the Government that came out of the Revolution of September. Under this reform, the name of the Academy was changed to the Royal Polytechnic Academy in 1837. However, the Royal Economic and Literary Academy, under the supervision of the board of directors of the General Company of Agriculture in the Alto Douro vineyards, was transferred to the Council of Lenses. Despite the great financial difficulties experienced during this period, the Polytechnic Academy of Porto underwent a time of great scientific activity, with eminent scientists such as Gomes Ferreira and Teixeira da Silva. 276x276px The inauguration of the University of Porto took place on 16 July 1911, and mathematician Gomes Teixeira was chosen as first Reitor (rector). At this time, the university became economically and scientifically independent, and teaching autonomy was officially recognized. Currently, there are 14 faculties and a postgraduate business school at the university. Research and development R&D; activities at the University of Porto have significantly expanded over the last years, mainly as a result of academic qualification and increased funding of R&D; centers and concession of research grants through competitive programs with external independent evaluation by international peer review committees. Although R&D; centers vary noticeably in dimension, aims and structure – from small units to large centers, conducting specialized or interdisciplinary work, faculty integrated or independent – they are present in almost every field of knowledge showing a shared vision towards a modern research-oriented university. Many of these centers are interface institutions whose aim is the development of links of cooperation between the university and external entities such as enterprises or governmental organizations. Among the most recognized research centers of the university are IBMC (Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular, Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology), IPATIMUP (Instituto de Patologia e Immunologia Molecular da Universidade do Porto, Institute of Molecular Pathology and Immunology of the University of Porto) and INESC-Porto (Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores, Research Institute of Computer Systems). The University of Porto collaborates with many companies though its Parque da Ciencia e Tecnologia do Porto, a business incubator and business entrepreneur centre. Some companies included on these centre are: Nonius, Fan Valley or Veniam. 134x134px Rankings The University of Porto is consistently ranked among the best Portuguese universities. It is among the top 100 universities in Europe, according to the Webometrics Ranking Web of Universities. In 2018, the ARWU ranked the university in the category 301–400 best universities in the world. In 2019, the QS World University Rankings ranked the university as 328th best in the world. QS puts the University of Porto at 51-100 in the subject rankings for Architecture, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, and Sports Science. Facilities The University buildings – faculties, R&D; centres, student residences and sport facilities – are grouped in three main sites (called ‘poles’). In the city centre – where the neoclassical building of architect Carlos Amarante marks the birthplace of the University – lies Pole 1; Pole 2 (Asprela) is a campus in the northern end of Porto; Pole 3 (Campo Alegre) is located in the western part of the city, over the river Douro bank, not far from Pole 1. A number of other institutes and centers are scattered all over the city and even beyond its limits. Students 149x149px Erasmus students The students of the University of Porto organise several extra curricular events. In sports, those include the activities promoted within G.A.D.U.P. and C.D.U.P.. In culture, the University recognizes as its cultural extension groups like Orfeão Universitário do Porto (choir, dance and music), Teatro Universitário do Porto (theatre), NEFUP (folklore), SDdUP (debates), CLUP (choir of the Faculty of Letters) and AAOUP (former Orfeão members). The academic life offers major festivities, with events ranging from the Latada to the Queima das Fitas. This last event is organized in cooperation with FAP – Federação Académica do Porto and it is considered the biggest student festivity in Porto.

He identifies as Carpathian. Early life and education Rovt was born to an observant Jewish family in Mukachevo, Carpathia which is now part of the Ukraine.Businessweek: “Alex Rovt, the Fertilizer Baron of Manhattan” By Andrew Rice September 06, 2012 His father was a manager at a knitting factory and his mother a housewife.Forbes: “How Ukrainian Billionaire Alexander Rovt Bought The Sloane Mansion” by Morgan Brennan March 26, 2012 He grew up across the nearby border in Hungary and then attended the Lviv Academy of Commerce in the Ukraine where he graduated with a degree in business and later received a PhD in international economics. After school, he worked as a manager for the state-owned vegetable distributor in Hungary but was soon arrested due to his capitalistic business tendencies; in 1985, he fled to the United States with his wife and settled in Brooklyn where he worked in his uncle’s kosher deli and at a cousin’s jewelry store. Career In 1988, Rovt took a job at IBE Trade which was founded by Sheldon Silverston. IBE made a profit by selling goods to governments that were not in favor with the international community and as a result, did not have ready access to hard currency. IBE was paid in hard commodities rather than cash (e.g. steel, coffee). Thanks to Rovt’s connections in the Eastern bloc and understanding of the fertilizer business thanks to his involvement at the vegetable distributor, IBE expanded it operations to the Soviet Union supplying goods in exchange for fertilizer, something the Soviets had in abundance thanks to ample natural gas supplies, a primary input to the manufacture of fertilizer. Once Perestroika took hold, the barter business diminished and Rovt (along with his childhood friend and co-worker at IBE, Imre Pákh) bought IBE from Silverston and transitioned the company into a traditional fertilizer distributor eventually controlling 85-90% of the fertilizer trade in Russia and the Ukraine by 2000. In 1999, Rovt purchased a deteriorating fertilizer plant in Bulgaria on the condition that he spend $100 million over five years on renovations. The company was losing money due to high natural gas prices which were then trading at market prices. Rovt sold a 25% stake in the company to the energy billionaire Igor Makarov from Turkmenistan who agreed to supply the plant with natural gas at discounted price. He also sold 10% to local Bulgarian partners. Unbeknownst to him, his Bulgarian partners were able to seize control of the facility by transferring ownership of the plant to an offshore company in Cyprus. His friend and partner Pákh sold his interest in IBE to Rovt after one of his Bulgarian partners was murdered. Rovt sued in the US to recover his plant and received a favorable decision but the judgment was not honored in Bulgaria. Despite his unfavorable foray into fertilizer plant ownership in Bulgaria, he purchased several more fertilizer plants in the 2000s which both became very lucrative investments. The first was in Rossosh, Russia in partnership with Igor Olshansky, the son of a member of the Duma (in whose district the plant was located) and the Norwegian agricultural company Yara International. In 2004, IBE purchased a plant in Severodonetsk, Ukraine in return for an investment commitment of $120 million. In 2005, after the Orange Revolution, a court voided the sale; Rovt, with the assistance of the US government, was eventually able to have the decision reversed and the plant is operating profitably with the consent of the Ukrainian government. In 2007, wanting to secure his wealth, he purchased the Bankers Trust Building from Joshua Zamir for $303 million in cashNew York Times: “Fertilizer Billionaire Buys Buildings His Way, in Cash” By JULIE SATOW April 10, 2012 and sold his remaining overseas fertilizer assets to Ukrainian billionaire Dmitry Firtash. He now has a portfolio of 280 buildings mostly in New York City. Rovt is a conservative investor. He invests for the long term and does not believe in debt. Public service and political donations Rovt served on the NYC Board of Corrections as Vice Chairman and is a trustee of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.New York Observer: “Ukrainian Oligarch Alexander Rovt Would Prefer To Be Called A Carpathian Billionaire” by Kim Velsey September 11, 2012 He serves as the chairman of the board of the Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center. He has donated to the campaigns of Andrew Cuomo and Anthony Weiner. Rovt has endowed a school for Orthodox immigrants, the Zvi Dov Roth Academy in Brooklyn. The school is named after his grandfather who was killed in the Holocaust. Personal life He lives on Manhattan’s Upper East Side with his wife Olga in a five-story, 12,000-square-foot building constructed out of reinforced concrete with brick facing and retractable bulletproof shades covering the windows.

Among his accomplishments, he was a member of the Missouri and Arizona Territorial legislatures, United States Attorney for New Mexico Territory, and a member of the Hawaiian privy council. Missouri Details of Jones' birth are uncertain but he appears to have been born around 1815, possibly near Mobile, Alabama. During his lifetime, Jones is known to have given five different locations for his birth including a claim, made while he was living in the New Mexico Territory, that he had been born to an American consul in Catalonia, Spain. There is, however, no record of a U.S. diplomat stationed at any Spanish speaking post around the time of Jones' birth. Details of his education are equally unclear but it is known that he was a highly literate writer. In addition to English, Jones was also fluent and literate in Spanish. During the Second Seminole War, Jones enlisted as a private in a six-month company from northwestern Missouri. He would later claim that he served with a courtesy rank of lieutenant as a commissary officer. His claim was substantiated by an act of the 33rd Congress (S.B. 250) dated July 27, 1854. His service during the war led to his introduction to politics. Beginning in late 1838, Jones served as clerk for a legislative committee established by the Missouri General Assembly designed to look into improper use of troops from the state during the war. After completion of this task, Jones began practicing law in Carrollton, Missouri. He also became a colonel in the local militia, seeing limited service related to the aftermath of the 1838 Mormon War. Jones advanced quickly within the Missouri Democratic party. He became an editor for the Missouri Revised Statutes, secretary for the Missouri State Senate, had a seat on the board of curators for the University of Missouri, and was vice president and legal council for the State Historical Society of Missouri. The 1844 U.S. presidential election also saw him become an elector. While living in Carrollton, Jones met and married Sarah Freeman. The union produced three children: Bennington, Laura, and Claude (died in infancy). In 1846, Jones moved his family to southwestern Missouri. There he became one of the incorporators for Neosho and won election to a four-year term in the Missouri State Senate. About this time, the nearby Neosho River served as Jones' muse as he penned a poem dealing with two Indian lovers. Jones was not content with his position however and wrote to the President asking for appointment to a federal position. Toward this end he was willing to accept any available position, writing \\"it matters not\\" as to the type or location of the appointment. In mid-1847, Jones took his family to Van Buren and Fort Smith, Arkansas where he practiced law for a time. From there he visited Texas, passing through Nacogdoches and Corpus Christi. During this time the Missouri legislature was out of session. When Jones returned to Missouri for the beginning of the next session, he discovered that his seat had been declared vacant and a replacement had been elected. Jones challenged the ruling and won back his seat after several days of hearings. New Mexico In 1850, Jones left Missouri for the California Gold Rush. A Missouri newspaper editorialized his wandering spirit, claiming \\"from California we suppose he will go to Oregon, and from thence to the Sandwich Islands, Tierra del Fuego, Cape Cod or Point-no-Point, and thence perhaps to the Lower Regions.\\" While in California he operated a legal office specializing in Mexican and Spanish land grants while in Benecia, built one of the first wooden buildings in San Jose, and presided as judge during an extra-legal trial in San Luis Obispo. After returning to Missouri in 1853, Jones gave speeches advocating the organization of Nebraska Territory throughout his home state and eastern Kansas. President Franklin Pierce acted upon Jones' request for federal appointment in August 1854, nominating him to become United States Attorney for New Mexico Territory. Instead of locating in the territorial capital of Santa Fe, Jones placed his office in Las Cruces. His reason for doing so was that El Paso County, Texas was within his district and much of his case load dealt with customs issues for goods coming from El Paso del Norte (now Ciudad Juárez). Being \\"acquainted with the Spanish language, and the customs and laws of the country,\\" Jones quickly became \\"very popular\\" with the Hispanic population along the Rio Grande. His charming personality also allowed him to quickly make friends among the common folk, friends that often left once they came to know Jones better. Jones had less success winning over the territory's political elite. A week after his arrival, Jones aggravated many territorial politicians by asking the territorial legislature to memorialize the U.S. Congress by asking for the southern portion of the territory to be divided off and formed into a new territory named \\"Pimeria\\" (from the old Spanish name meaning land of the Pimas). After the legislature rejected his request, Jones declared, \\"The jealousy of New Mexico caused it to sleep the sleep of death.\\" Several months later, Jones accused James Longstreet, \\"aided by a few desperate individuals,\\" of not paying the import duty on grain imported from Mexico and used by the U.S. Army. While there was probably truth to the accusation, the intended target of the charges was most likely Simeon Hart, an El Paso-based businessman with significant political connections. Jones went so far in the resulting dispute as to write the War department and ask that General John Garland, Longstreet's father-in-law, be removed as commander of the Military Department of New Mexico. The War Department dealt with the letter by forwarding it to Garland. While he was in New Mexico, Jones' wife, who had remained in Missouri with their children, filed for divorce. After the divorce was finalized, Jones married \\"a very young Mexican girl\\" from Mesilla apparently named Maria v. del Refugio. New Mexico's Territorial Delegate to Congress Miguel Antonio Otero, in January 1858, responded to news of the marriage by claiming Jones had \\"abducted\\" the supposedly twelve-year-old bride and demanded that President James Buchanan fire the U.S. Attorney. Before any official action could be taken, Jones had submitted his resignation. Jones' second marriage had ended by the time of the 1860 census. During his time in New Mexico, Jones was a strong proponent of creating a separate territory from the southern portion of New Mexico Territory. When Charles Debrille Poston met him in 1856 the two men organized a petition to the United States Congress supporting the Gadsden Purchase. Additionally, Jones circulated a Spanish language petition for creation of the new territory from the newly squired land. The future \\"Father of Arizona\\" later claimed that this petition was the first document he ever saw that used the name \\"Arizona\\". After years of petitions without any results, Jones became a proponent of Southern secession in February 1861. He hoped that the Confederate Congress would create the new territory that the U.S. Congress had so far declined to create. Toward this end Jones also announced his candidacy to become Arizona's territorial delegate to the Confederate congress. He also wrote a four-stanza poem praising the stars and bars which was published in the Mesilla Times. When the American Civil War reached New Mexico Territory in July 1861, Jones was in Santa Fe with battle lines preventing his return to Mesilla. There he was arrested on suspicion of treason but was released several months later when an Albuquerque based grand jury declined to issue an indictment. His imprisonment did however prevent his election to the Confederate Congress. Shifts in the battle lines briefly placed Santa Fe under Confederate control in March 1862. Following the Battle of Glorieta Pass, Jones returned to Mesilla with the retreating Confederate troops from Texas. From Mesilla, Jones decided to journey to California by way of Chihuahua, Mexico. Bandits stripped him of his possessions and Jones was forced to return to Paso del Norte (now Ciudad Juarez). He remained in the Mexican city, Union officials unwilling to allow the perceived Confederate sympathizer to return to the United States, until President Abraham Lincoln announced his general amnesty plan. It was not until February 16, 1864 that Jones took an oath of loyalty in El Paso, Texas. Arizona Territory WCJ31After re-entering the United States, Jones moved to Tucson in the newly created Arizona Territory. There he partnered with Colonel George W. Bowie and Captain C. A. Smith, both from the 5th Regiment California Volunteer Infantry, to reopen several mines in the Dragoon Mountains. The filings claimed that Jones had discovered \\"two ledges of goldbearing quartz\\" along with silver and copper deposits in June 1856 and had \\"reopened [them] in 1861 and 1864, but [they] have not been continually worked owing to the hostility of the Apache Indians.\\" This was followed by other partnerships silver mines near Tubac and Mission Los Santos Ángeles de Guevavi. These partnerships appear to have revived Jones' financial health from his loss to Mexican bandits because, on July 6, 1864, he had enough resources to purchase former Sonoran Governor Manuel Gándara's share of the Mission Guevavi mine. In addition to his financial recovery, Jones experienced an upswing in his political fortunes. In June 1864, he presided over a convention to organize a municipal government in Tucson The next month saw his election to represent Pima County in the 1st Arizona Territorial Legislature. When the legislature convened in Prescott, he was selected to serve as speaker of the House of Representatives During the session, there was a divide between factions wishing to locate the territorial capital in Tucson and others wishing to locate it in Prescott. Jones proposed creation of a new town near the confluence of the Salt and Gila Rivers as a compromise to these positions. He further proposed the new town be named Aztlan after the popular belief at the time that ruins in the area were the product of the Aztec civilization. In recognition of his extensive knowledge, his fellow legislators convinced Jones to give a series of public lectures on the geography, resources, and history of the new territory. They also created the Arizona Historical Society (not the same organization that currently bears that name) and named him to be corresponding secretary. In other actions, Jones translated a condensed version of the territory's new legal code, the \\"Howell Code\\", into Spanish. During the session, Jones became romantically involved with Caroline E. Stephens. The fifteen-year-old girl arrived in Prescott with her parents on October 5, 1864 after a six-month journey from Texas. The couple married on November 13, three days after the end of the legislative session, in what has been dubbed the first wedding in Prescott. At the end of the wedding festivities, Jones took his bride to Tucson in the company of Judge Joseph P. Allyn. Jones was recommended for the position of deputy collector and inspector of customs at Tucson by W. W. Mills, the collector of customs in El Paso, Texas, on March 31, 1865. Jones withdrew his name from consideration on April 3, claiming he would have taken the position if it were located in Wickenburg. He then returned to Prescott with his wife. On May 5, Jones disappeared from Prescott. His abandoned bride received a divorce in April 1867. Hawaii Details of Jones' life after he abandoned his wife in Prescott are limited for several years. He is known to have traveled by steamship from San Diego to San Francisco, California. During this trip he met another member of the Arizona Territorial Legislature, Edward D. Tuttle, and told him he intended to go to Hawaii. Davis Power of Attorney1Jones arrived in Honolulu on February 24, 1866 on the American Bark D. C. Murray. On March 6, a mere 11 days after arriving, he swore fealty to the Kingdom of Hawaii and was made a naturalized citizen of the island nation. Six days later, on March12, he was admitted to the Bar of Hawaii and licensed to practice law. Mark Twain wrote, in his June 22, 1866, letter from Hawai'i, that \\"Judge Jones\\" informed him that \\"he has already more law practice on his hands than he can well attend to.\\" In February 1868, Jones won election to the Legislature of the Kingdom of Hawaii and represented the South Kona district in the House of Representatives. There is no evidence however that Jones had lived in the district at the time of his election. On April 27, 1868, nine days after the legislature convened for its first session, Jones resigned his seat. He resigned because of objections raised by Noble C. R. Bishop, husband of Princess Pau'ahi, as to his right to sit as a representative from South Kona because Jones had not been domiciled in the district prior to his election for the legally required period of three years. Ma'ema'e Ka'ilihaoSoon after leaving the legislature, Jones married Ma'ema'e Kailiha'o Meheiwa. The fifteen-year old bride descended from a noble Hawaiian family whose members included Kana'ina-nui, the High Chief who killed Captain Cook in 1779, and Moana-wahine, the ranking High Priestess of Hawai'i Island in the mid 1700s. The union produced sons Bennington, Ulysses and Elias and daughters Aletheia and Minerva before her death in 1881, at age 28, from a smallpox epidemic in Honolulu that eventually killed 287 people, most of them native Hawaiians. During most of the 1870s, Jones served as a judge. His abilities as a public speaker were also in demand with locals appreciating \\"his eloquence ... his commanding nose, flashing eyes and marked gestures\\" and bestowing the sobriquet Aeko (eagle) upon him. This changed in 1880 when Jones met Celso Caesar Moreno. The Italian man had befriended King Kalākaua and convinced the king to name him Prime Minister. Moreno likewise convinced Jones to resign his job as judge and to accept a position on the royal privy council. He accepted the position of Attorney General of Hawaii on August 14, 1880. diplomatic pressure from Britain, France, and the United States prompted the king to abandon his new cabinet. As a result, Jones lost his position as Attorney General on September 27, 1880. Hard times beset Jones after losing his position as Attorney General. He was unable to find a job capable of replacing the $3000/year income he had received as a judge. He instead served in a lesser position by becoming commissioner of Private Ways and Water Rights at Hilo. Then in early 1881 his fourth wife died at age 28. Jones married a fifth time four months later to Mary Akina. His final marriage lasted till late 1883 when she filed for divorce on grounds of multiple instances of adultery by her husband. Jones died on March 3, 1884 after a prolonged illness in Wailuku, Maui Hawaiian newspapers published a number of obituaries using information Jones had provided over the years to detail his life before his arrival in the islands. Roughly half of the facts provided by Jones are provably false with another quarter being unverifiable.

In 2009, Sekhar sent multiple emails to Luke Bierman, who was at the time legal counsel to New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. According to the emails obtained from Sekhar's home computer by the FBI, Sekhar demanded that Bierman advise the comptroller to commit to a $35 million retirement fund investment at Sekhar's firm, threatening to reveal details of Bierman's alleged extra-marital affair to his wife, DiNapoli, and the media. After initially being charged with coercion under state law, Sekhar was tried and convicted for attempted extortion under the federal Hobbs act. Sekhar's lawyers contended that the advice of a lawyer employed by the state was not a form of property that could be sought by threats, and hence that the extortion charge was not applicable in this case. The argument was refuted by a federal district court judge and by the Second Circuit court on appeal. Sekhar's lawyers then approached the United States Supreme Court in September 2012. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority. The Court held that legal advice could not be considered to be \\"transferable property\\" and therefore did not fit the definition of extortion under the Hobbs Act.

The genus was formally described in 2012. The 5 species occur in Eurasia, North Africa, and North America. Description The species in genus Chenopodiastrum are non-aromatic annual herbs. Young plants have vesicular trichomes, that later collapse and fall down, thus plants becoming glabrescent. Stems grow erect, with lateral branches. The alternate leaves have a petiole and a thickish triangular, ovate, rhombic-ovate to lanceolate leaf blade. The leaf margin can be irregularly dentate or lobed, or pinnatifid with narrow dentate lobes. The axillary and terminal inflorescences consist of small dense glomerules of flowers, arranged spicately or paniculately. Flowers are bisexual or pistillate. They contain 5 basally connate perianth segments with a prominent keel near the apex, and a characteristic strong midrib visible from the inside; a circle of 5 stamens; and an ovary with 2 stigmas. In fruit, the perianth lobes enclose the fruit or spread. The membraneous pericarp adheres firmly to the seed. The horizontally orientated seeds are lenticular. The black seed coat is often prominently pitted, sometimes rugulose or nearly smooth. Systematics and distribution The genus Chenopodiastrum was described in 2012 by Suzy Fuentes-Bazan, Pertti Uotila und Thomas Borsch (in: A novel phylogeny-based generic classification for Chenopodium sensu lato, and a tribal rearrangement of Chenopodioideae (Chenopodiaceae). in Willdenowia 42, p. 14). After phylogenetic research, this group of species had to be separated from genus Chenopodium, that would otherwise have been polyphyletic. The genus Chenopodiastrum belongs to the same tribe as Chenopodium, Tribus Atripliceae. Chenopodiastrum consists of 5 species, occurring in Eurasia, North Africa, and North America: *Chenopodiastrum badachschanicum (Tzvelev) S.Fuentes, Uotila & Borsch, (syn.

Background and recording After the success of his first album, 1996's Inarticulate Nature Boy, Clayton-Felt prepared to release a new batch of songs under the title Center of Six. Record label A&M; suspended all contracts and placed a freeze on recordings during their buyout by Universal Records, preventing the release of Center of Six; subsequently, over 200 artists were dropped during the post-acquisition \\"cleaning house\\" process, including Clayton-Felt. Further, the new owners refused to allow Clayton-Felt to use or buy back his previously recorded material, and he was contractually prevented from re-recording it for five years, though he continued working on the material. Over the years following the change of ownership, Clayton-Felt developed new material, self-releasing two recordings - ...Felt Like Making a Live Record and Beautiful Nowhere; whilst also continuing to lobby Universal to release its claim on his earlier work. Clayton-Felt finished the final mixing and production of Spirit Touches Ground in early December 1999, just one week before being hospitalized with what turned out to be choriocarcinoma (a rare form of testicular cancer with the worst prognosis of all germ-cell cancers); he died at the age of 32 less than a month later. Universal relinquished its claim on his unreleased music while Clayton-Felt was hospitalized in a coma, his family whispering the long-sought news into his ear. Led by Laura Baker, Clayton-Felt's sister, a network of friends and fans lobbied for the promotion and distribution of this long- delayed material, eventually organizing for the album completed shortly before his death to be released under the Dreamworks label in 2002. Other unreleased material including the song \\"Center of Six\\" itself was released by the Talking Clouds Records label in 2003 on the album Center of Six. Release and reception Spirit Touches Ground received largely positive reviews upon its release on February 12, 2002. Kevin Bronson of the Los Angeles Times wrote the album \\"brims with grand metaphor and unrelenting hope, the crisp, tuneful work of a singer-songwriter in full bloom.\\" Randy Krbechek of CD Shakedown wrote, \\"Despite the turmoil in the background, Spirit Touches Ground, has an uplifting feel.\\" Vanessa Bormann of Ink 19 wrote: > After his early band, School Of Fish, began to drift apart and he made the > decision to go solo, Josh Clayton-Felt was born. He released three discs, > all of them increasingly better written, deeper, more touching. But in a > rightful crescendo, it is in Josh's case, that the best has been saved for > last. Bradley Torreano of Allmusic gave the album four and a half out of five stars and noted that Clayton-Felt had substantial talent and the potential for a successful career, writing: > If this album is any indication, Clayton-Felt was on his way to becoming the > lighthearted alternative to Jeff Buckley.

And both musicians were sadly taken from the world far too > early in their careers, something that has halted any mainstream exposure > Clayton-Felt could have received. Rob Brunner of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+ and also noted that his death was a loss to the music world, writing: \\"Like similarly minded L.A. smart-pop artists Aimee Mann and Jason Falkner, Clayton-Felt writes modest songs that take time to reveal their true depth. It's a real loss that the singer won't get the same chance himself.\\" Lisa Hummel of Mode Weekly gave an even more favorable review writing: > More than posthumous blabber, the raves being lauded upon Spirit are > entirely warranted. Lyrically strong and fundamentally sound, the 14-track > disc is at times sweet and spiritual; at others, it is rockin’ and loud. > From the first cut, the catchy current single “Building Atlantis” (I hold > your hand/As we disappear into the sand/While the rest of the world was > drowning around us/Ah, we were building Atlantis/Of all the pieces I’ve > lost/Only you fit/Cause we were building Atlantis”), to the last, \\"Dragon > Fly'\\"(If you want to get through/To the other side/Let the dragonfly/Come > and give you a ride/Every day you’re born/And every night you die), Spirit > journeys on with a beatnik-folk, soulful feel. Patrick Schabe of PopMatters gave the album a glowing review, noting influence from some very successful artists: > Spirit Touches Ground reveals elements of John Lennon, Stevie Wonder, Jeff > Buckley, and a slew of musical influences, yet always feels like a personal > extension of Josh himself rather than imitation. And, as so many have noted > in the past, there's his voice.

Fufkin.com writer Gary Glauber also gave the album a glowing review, writing \\"the record stands as an ultimate testament to how much his talents will be missed.\\" He stated the most obvious musical comparison may be Jeff Buckley, though he agreed that Clayton-Felt sounded much lighter. Glauber goes on to write about each of the tracks and what he feels are their strong points before arriving at the following conclusion: > This is gentle intimate pop with a life force and musical intelligence > behind it that makes one smile. Let Spirit Touches Ground touch you with its > hooks and friendly funky fare, its grooves and hushed ballads, its beauty > and fanciful turns and rampant optimism and sweet melodies.

Greb (August 7, 1921 - September 12, 2016)San José State University Emeritus Faculty Association Biography was an emeritus professor of San Jose State University, a \\"distinguished broadcast educator\\"' historianAuthor of Charles Herrold, Inventor of Radio Broadcasting; The Benbow family, California pioneers: A history and genealogy from England to America : Thomas and Sarah Benbow, 1820 to today and an investigative journalist.  Early life and education  Greb was a fourth generation Californian. He was born on a farm in Irvington (Alameda County), California, and grew up in Oakland and San Leandro. His father worked as a Southern Pacific railroad engineer and his mother was a housewife. During the Great Depression, young Greb sold magazines door to door (Saturday Evening Post, Liberty), earned a few dollars selling cartoons and stories to Oakland newspapers (Tribune, Post Enquirer) and for a short time appeared on radio as a child actor (Rusty, Boy Aviator, KTAB, 1934). After serving as editor of his high school newspaper and winning the Rotary Club oratorical contest supporting world peace in spring 1939, he completed his undergraduate degrees (AA, BA) at the University of California at Berkeley, his master’s (MA) at the University of Minnesota, and became a Ph.D. candidate at Stanford University.  Military  After Pearl Harbor, Greb volunteered for the U. S. Army and served three years in World War II (1943 to 1946). On maneuvers with the 102nd Infantry Division at Camp Swift, Texas, he contracted pneumonia, received last rites from a Catholic chaplain and needed 104 days of hospitalization to recover. His outfit was shipped overseas without him. He was assigned to Special Services at Fort Dix, New Jersey, and rose to staff sergeant while editing the camp newspaper (The Fort Dix Post) and working as a recording engineer in the WDIX studios.  Entrepreneurship  In 1942, with Dave Houser, Greb initiated the Bay Area’s first local radio newscast over KROW in Oakland. In 1954, he formed Gordon Greb & Associates, a survey research company that measured listenership for local radio stations. In 1962, he began the Co-Ad Agency with Kenneth Roed to place advertising in college newspapers nationwide. In 1972, Greb created Newsmaker Features that syndicated his \\"Birthday Quiz\\" and \\"These Great People\\" in such dailies as the San Jose Mercury-News, Seattle Times and San Rafael Daily Independent.  Advocacy  = Ending film censorship = In order to challenge a long-standing decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that had permitted movie censorship in eight states and 90 cities, Greb prepared a thesis calling for freedom of the movies. He offered it to the law firm of Ephraim S. London, which was appealing the New York State Board of Regents' ban on exhibition of a controversial film called The Miracle. At the time, Greb was a graduate student at Stanford University. The result was a precedent-changing unanimous decision (9-0) protecting movies from censorship under the First Amendment in Burstyn v. Wilson, et al. (1952). The decision overruled Mutual Film Corporation v. Industrial Commission of Ohio that had upheld film censorship for more than 37 years. In thanking Greb for allowing him to quote his research in the oral argument, London wrote, \\"I am amazed that someone who is not a lawyer could have had so clear a comprehension of the legal questions involved.\\":File:Ephraim London letter.jpg = Exposing state corruption = As an investigative reporter at a San Jose radio station (KSJO), he began conducting interviews by telephone and compiling documents that enabled him to uncover improper influence peddling involving millions of dollars of California’s money at the state capital. Coming as a surprise to the entire press corps in Sacramento, he exposed a bitter behind-the-scenes struggle between two of California’s most powerful officials – Gov. Goodwin J. Knight and State Treasurer Gus Johnson – concerning who should benefit from the profit-making potential of the state’s treasury. Broadcasting the story to his Northern California audience (jointly released statewide by UP) ultimately brought about a state legislative inquiry that forced Johnson to resign in what the UP bureau chief Jim Anderson in 1956 called \\"the best state political story in many a moon\\". = Making historical discovery = In 1959, Greb published a research paper in the Journal of Broadcasting proving that San Jose was the birthplace of broadcasting. He provided documents and witnesses \\\\- to establish that the first broadcaster was a Stanford University dropout – former science major Charles David Herrold – who was transmitting regularly scheduled programs starting in 1909 from his College of Engineering and Wireless in the Garden City Bank building that predated the accepted beginning (KDKA, 1920) by eleven years. Herrold worked in collaboration with his wife Sybil and numerous students. Greb’s revelation of Herrold’s accomplishment was significant enough for Journal of Broadcasting editor Robert Summers to credit him for making a \\"first station find\\" (winter 1958-59 issue) and for the media authority Christopher H. Sterling to recognize Herrold as one of the founding fathers of Silicon Valley, since he was at \\"…the very beginning of what has grown into the modern electronic media business\\". = Political activism = In the 1950s, Greb joined Alan Cranston (later U.S. Senator) in organizing the Democratic Club movement that challenged the Republican Party domination in the state of California. He participated in campaigns that elected Nicholas Petris and Robert Crown to the state assembly and Carlos Bee and Alfred Alquist to the state senate, among others, while active with the Democratic Party’s State Central Committee. In 1969, Greb handled press relations for the local union president Al Rutherford, and the state leader John Sterling of the American Federation of Teachers (later Phoenix University founder) in a 37-day strike by faculty members at San Jose State College. While their union action was opposed by Gov. Ronald Reagan, it eventually led to legislation that granted collective bargaining rights to teachers.  Journalism  Greb became a journalist as a youngster in 1935 by publishing his own newspaper in Oakland, California, (The Katz Meow) with Jack Corbett when both were in junior high school. He started his professional career as a newspaperman for the San Leandro News Observer in 1939 and continued after World War II at the San Rafael Independent Journal. He then moved to San Francisco Bay Area radio stations KROW, KRCC, KLX, KTIM, KVSM, KSJO and KSJS; television stations KNTV, KABC, KNBC, KQED, KCSM, and KTEH; as well as network stations owned by CBS and ABC in Hollywood, and NBC in Burbank. He has been heard on the BBC World Service and featured on the PBS series History Detectives. A veteran of radio broadcasting since 1934, Greb is one of the oldest of Northern California’s notable broadcasters and was named to the Bay Area Radio Hall of Fame in 2011. During his career in radio and television, he was a judge for the Emmy Awards of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences and statewide chairman of the radio and television awards committee of The Associated Press.  Teaching and research  A founding member and co-ordinator of the School of Journalism’s Graduate Program in Mass Communications, Professor Greb retired from San Jose State University in 1990. During his years in higher education, Greb lectured internationally at universities in the United Kingdom, Australia, China, Fiji, New Zealand and Thailand as well as at Stanford University, the University of Oregon (Eugene), the University of Minnesota (Minneapolis) and the University of Wisconsin (Madison). He taught courses at San Jose State University (1956 -1991) in all media – newspaper, magazine, public relations and broadcast journalism, the latter being a new program he introduced in 1957 and which became the state’s first B.A. degree in that discipline. Early in his career he helped to pioneer instructional television with recorded lectures on \\"The Press and Democracy\\" in 1960 and \\"“Contemporary Issues in American Society\\" which he organized in 1967 with professors from history, political science and philosophy. To provide American students with a world view, he took them abroad during several years to study in the United Kingdom (1980-1983), teaching a summer course on the \\"British Mass Media\\", holding seminars at Imperial College, the BBC, ITV, The Times, Fleet Street and ABC News (Peter Jennings). At the invitation of the U.S. State Department, Greb was a guest lecturer at China’s Radio-Television News Center and the University of Beijing in 1985, and an information specialist for news media and educational institutions in New Zealand, Australia and Fiji in 1991.

It featured new band members Tom Skerlj and Clint Vincent after founding member and guitarist Rob Maric left the band at the end of 2012. History In 2011, Tom Skerlj was added to the band as a second guitarist and keyboardist and the band began working on writing new material, hinting that they would follow a similar process to the preceding album in that completion of the songwriting would occur while the band was recording the album; \\"We don't ever write whole songs before we go into the studio. We generally take the seeds of songs,\\" Benzie explained in mid-2011. The band continued to tour in 2011 and played a limited number of shows in 2012, with guitarist Rob Maric spending time away from the band to deal with personal issues for the majority of the year. Clint Vincent of fellow Brisbane band Melodyssey was announced as his touring replacement. Maric announced in January 2013 that he would not be returning to the band, and Vincent was announced as Rob's permanent replacement a few days later. In late June 2013, the band finally confirmed the title of the new album, The Catalyst Fire, and stated it was to be released on 9 August. Forrester Savell produced the album, following his work on the band's debut This Is the Warning. On 5 July, the band released a new video and single for the track \\"Lodestar\\". Themes In an interview in 2011, Benzie explained that thematically the album would follow the subject matter of This Is the Warning; \\"most of the next one's going to be a bit of the after-effect: How can you combat things like that? How can small people deceive world bankers? The answer will actually be everyone -- what everyone does within their individual bubble, how we choose to act, and if that will butterfly effect out.\\" In 2013, Benzie revealed that some of the album's content was inspired by the band's touring, their environmental conscience and Benzie's experiences with the drug ayahuasca in South America. He added, \\"one of the reasons the album is quite dark, particularly on songs like The Cure, is part of the realisation that I am inadvertently responsible for all the things I see happening on TV, making that connection between what is happening in the world and my apathy. We're not slamming anything down anyone's throat, it's just the emotional snapshot of what we feel now.\\" Reception The Music.com.au gave the album a positive review, stating that \\"The Catalyst Fire is everything you expect: powerful, energetic, uplifting and inspiring.\\" Space Ship News praised the album, suggesting that \\"If This Is the Warning was a band firing on all cylinders, then The Catalyst Fire shows a band firing on cylinders they didn't even know they had; powerful and aggressive, yet somehow pristine and melodic.\\" SF Media also lauded the album, suggesting it was better than its predecessor and saying that \\"while the debut was excellent, it had the occasional dry moment here and there. Not so here, each and every song is strong, meaningful and compelling, especially opener 'The Cure' and first single 'Lodestar'.\\" The album has also been a success commercially, debuting at #2 on the Australian (ARIA) Album Charts, and was Triple J's feature album of the week starting 19 August.

Portrait of Auguste Denayrouze diving apparatus, in which air is pumped from the surface into a barrel-shaped reservoir, and then passes through the pressure-regulator built into the helmet.  Biography  Denayrouze was born on October 1, 1837, at Montpeyroux, Aveyron, France, on the Aubrac plateau. In 1852, at the age of fifteen, he was admitted to the Naval School. He was promoted to lieutenant de vaisseau in 1862, and embarked on an expedition to Cochinchina (present-day Vietnam). He contracted a serious illness which rendered him unfit for service at sea. While recovering in the commune of Espalion, Denayrouze met Benoît Rouquayrol, with whom he took part in several inventions. Since 1860, Rouquayrol had disclosed three patents for machines designed for mining emergencies, intended to furnish miners with air in case of firedamp or flooding of the mine. Denayrouze investigated the possibility of adapting the pressure regulator and developing it for underwater use. The two men thus designed and patented their \\"Rouquayrol-Denayrouze diving suit\\" in 1864. This would be the first diving suit that could supply air to the diver on demand. In the same year, the Imperial French Navy created a similar device. In February 1865, August Denayrouze created the \\"Rouquayrol-Denayrouze Society\\" to commercialize their inventions for sale to both the Navy and to private enterprises. The same year, he created the \\"French Society for Fish and Sponges Of The Eastern Mediterranean,\\" based in Izmir, Turkey. Two years later, the Rouquayrol- Denayrouze diving apparatus was presented at the 1867 World's Fair and won the gold medal. Jules Verne, who attended the exposition, discovered the invention with enthusiasm and chose it as the equipment for his fictional Captain Nemo and the crew of the Nautilus in the 1869 novel 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea. Verne gave homage to the inventors by calling out the inventors by name. In 1869, Denayrouze passed governance of the Society for Fish and Sponges to his brother, Louis Denayrouze, so that he could advance the commercial interests of the diving apparatus in the Eastern Mediterranean. In 1874, August Denayrouze dissolved both societies and created a single \\"Reunited Society for Mechanical Specialities,\\" and his brother Louis became its director. Denayrouze died on 1 January 1883, aged 45, of illness.

Description  Oncus planci is a cylindrically-shaped sea cucumber growing up to in length, and in diameter they have a brownish color, often with irregular dark brown patches. They have ten tentacles The eight large and two small feeding tentacles are branched, leaf-like, and lighter in colour than the body. They are suspension feeders. They have retractile tube feet arranged in five zigzag double rows. They have thick smooth leathery skin which is strengthened with calcareous spicules; some of these are plates pierced by more than four holes, and others are cup- shaped. Reproduction Oncus planci is known to show neotany, which means the juvenile form is retained beyond the usual age of maturation. The neotenous form has a single row of tube feet and is less than an inch long. These individuals were at first mistaken for a separate species which was given the biological name Ocnus brunneus. The sexes are separate in this species and adults reproduce sexually by spawning in spring. The fertilised eggs are retained by the female on her tentacles where they develop directly into the adult form without undergoing metamorphosis. The neotenous form reproduces asexually by transverse binary fission. Distribution and habitat These sea cucumbers are found in European waters and off the coast of West Africa. The neotenous form being distributed in the north. They are epifaunal species living on hard substrates, on rocks, shells, tubeworms and algae. They are found at depths of between . This species is found in Carlingford Lough and Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland, and because of its rarity there, it is listed as a Northern Ireland Priority Species.

The beginnings of inquiry about this council began with Zitkála-Šá (also known as Gertrude Bonnin) and Theodora Cunningham on March 1, 1926. This organization's purpose was to advocate for Native American rights and representation before the United States government. The National Council of American Indians focused on the Legislative Branch and their Congressional bills. The council's initial concerns included the H.R. 7826; a bill that would give Congress the power to jail any Indian for six months without trial or any court review. In addition to this, this bill would enforce a $100.00 fine every time a rule was broken within the time served in prison, as outlined by the regulations. Zitkala-Sa, along with her husband Raymond Bonnin, founded the National Council of American Indians. They both were Yankton Sioux Indigenous people. Zitkála-Šá and Raymond Bonnin's contributions to the National Council of American Indians started with its establishment as well as its leadership.  Organization  Zitkála-Šá wanted the Native American population to become more informed about the persecution within Congress. After a heated House Committee meeting with Representative William Williamson, there was disagreement of how Native Americans wanted to be treated within American society. During the committee meeting, Williamson argued that Native Americans wanted the H.R. 7826 law to be passed. Zitkála-Šá a and her husband Raymond Bonnin fought against this bill to be passed. In response to this Committee meeting, multiple Indian national representatives formed the National Council of American Indians, and made Zitkála-Šá the president. The other members of the National Council of American Indians included: Vice President Joshua Wetsit, Executive Secretary Treasurer Meade Steele, and Counsellor General R.T. Bonnin (Raymond Bonnin).The tribes included in the National Council of American Indians included the Apache, Assiniboine, Comanche, Chippewa, Crow, Kiowa, Klamath, Miami, Oneida, Osage, Ponca, Sioux, and Utes. As time went on, more tribes were represented through individual memberships and chapters across the United States. While there were many Indigenous nations represented, Zitkála-Šá and Raymond Bonnin were represented in legal representation and visibility, because of their leadership roles with the council. Not all Native American tribes were able to be represented and the National Council of American Indians documents only showed the names of the tribes who agreed to be on the council. Both Zitkála-Šá and Raymond Bonnin corresponded with people across the United States as well as traveled to publicize the NCAI as legitimate way to keep the U.S. government responsible.  Zitkala-Ša and Raymond Bonnin’s Contributions  Zitkála-Šá by Gertrude Käsebier, 1898 Zitkála-Šá was also a member of the League of American Penwomen, and their mantra was “who’s who in the nation’s capital, 1927” which informed its members role of Congress and gained access to information about Congressmen in Washington D.C. The League of American Penwomen was an organization started in 1897 by Marian Longfellow O'Donoghue. This organization would later help with connecting Zitkála-Šá 's activism later in life. In a letter from March 5, 1928, Zitkála-Šá informed the delegation about the important members of the House Committee on Indian Affairs and specifically whom to speak to. In addition to this, she also advocated for the passing of H.R. 9315. In Section 2 of this bill, it would prohibit the unlawful jailing of Indians and permit them the due process of law as well as providing special law enforcement on the reservation. Zitkála- Šá's dedication for Native American rights was shown through her participation with the American Indian magazine, Old Indian Legends, among other artistic projects. She was also a member of the Society of American Indians, created in 1911, which influenced the creation of the Council of American Indians. Zitkála-Šá would go on to become an accomplished author of many articles and stories as well as an opera. Her work with the Bureau of Indian Affairs was vital for the continued activism for Native Americans within the United States government. Raymond Bonnin was culturally Yankton and Dakota Yankton and was assigned to work for the Uintah-Ouray reservation, where they worked at fourteen years. He also overtook the position of Executive Secretary-Treasurer in 1929, after Meade Steele. He also was able to fight alongside Zitkála-Šá for the rights of the National Council of American Indians. At his funeral, Ernest Wilkinson, President of Brigham Young University and prominent leader in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints gave the eulogy. Wilkinson was the lawyer Raymond worked with to progress Indigenous lands claims through the U.S. court system.  Purpose  On the official documentation, the purpose of the National Council of American Indians was to “Help Indians help themselves in protecting their rights and priorities.” The work of the National Council of American Indians at this time was to track legislation through Congress that involved Native Americans. “For the protection and preservation of all Indian People” was the mantra for the National Council of American Indians. This phrase concentrated Zitkála-Šá ’s efforts and the ability to spread information to other Native Americans. When concerning what their purpose should be, Zitkála-Šá said, “We must resort to this means of mutual protection sooner or later; and we must not fuss or find fault with minor things; but all look to the big things that are possible of accomplishment if we truly unite our forces; If the Indian people want to live; and want their children to live, they must ORGANIZE; therefore they must join us.” Zitkála-Šá was one of many who drove the fight for Native American rights through organization as well as the spreading of information.  Advocacy  An example of policies and laws by Zitkála-Šá would be referring to in her activism work. In addition to fighting against discriminatory action against Native Americans, the National Council of American Indians also promoted voting rights among tribes. When concerned with the language of the H.R. 7826 bill, Zitkála-Šá said, “A man like Williamson should not be in Congress and you Indians out there should see to it that he does not get re- elected. You should all register and vote against him.” The National Council of American Indians was able to tract the bills concerning Native American rights because of Zitkála-Šá 's ties to the League of American Penwomen. In addition to H.R. 7826, the Council also advocated for the H.R. 9315 bill, and raised attention to the need for land rights. From February 1926 to the early 1930s, the NCAI was able to work steadily to gain lands claims for various tribes across the United States, because of Raymond Bonnin’s extensive legal work. Zitkála-Šá and others in the NCAI lobbied congress members, local representatives, friends, and families, to become educated and involved in Indigenous land claims, sovereignty rights, and social problems.  Death of Zitkála-Šá  Zitkála-Šá died at the age of sixty-one on January 26, 1938 and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery under the name, Gertrude Simmons Bonnin. Her funeral was in a chapel for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- Day Saints. Her family experienced many illnesses including her son as well as the serious grief of Raymond Bonnin. Raymond Bonnin worked closely with Ernest Wilkinson to submit claims cases to Congress after Zitkála-Šá ’s death. When writing about her legacy to others, he said, “She had always wanted me to go on working in the event that she should go first and so I am trying to do the things that I know she would have done had she been here. It is not easy to go on without her. She and I always worked in everything side by side, her interests were my interests and she never failed to help me whole heartedly in my work.” In March 1938, Raymond Bonnin was still Secretary-Treasurer and “sole-surviving officer” of the National Council; he wrote to the Third Assistant Postmaster General that the Council was still in existence. He was determined to keep her work and legacy alive. However, the Council was not able to survive because of tax exemption complications as well as the poverty of the members and lack of outside funding. At no time had the Council exceeded the amount of $1300 in any one year, and these funds were used for the basic needs of the organization; including stationary and office rent. After Raymond Bonnin’s death, there was no succession of leadership within the National Council of American Indians. The National Council of American Indians, Inc. ended with the Bonnins in 1942.  Legacy  First Meeting of the National Congress of American Indians The National Congress of American Indians was created on November 17, 1944. The National Council of American Indians and the National Congress of American Indians in purposes and activism both advocate for the progression of Native Americans within the United States. After the death of Zitkála-Šá and Raymond Bonnin, there was not a replacement of leadership. This caused the council to dissolve and the National Congress of American Indians was founded in 1944 and advocates for Native Americans through various initiatives. The current concerns of the National Congress of American Indians include community and culture; economic development and commerce; education, health, and human services; land and natural resources; and tribal governance. As of April 2019, the NCAI responded to an EPA legislation, proposing to revise the definition of water rights within the United States. Other legal filings are associated with the Tribal Supreme Court Project.  References  “About NCAI  NCAI.” n.d. Organization. National Congress of American Indians.

Manila: Tahanan Books, 1995  Career  Virata was in the United States when the Philippine Commonwealth was evacuated to America because of the raging war in the Pacific. From 1946 to 1948, he worked as an officer of the Philippine Embassy in the US. After the war, the task of directing the economic research of the newly organized Central Bank of the Philippines in 1949 fell on him. Subsequently, he was appointed as the bank’s deputy governor and later, as a member of the Monetary Board. In various United Nations conferences on finance, trade, industry and economics; Virata served in different capacities. He was the adviser to the Philippine delegate to the International Monetary Fund Conference at Washington, DC in 1949 and to the International Monetary Fund and International Bank Conference at Paris, France in 1950. He was a delegate of the Philippines to the Conference of the Consultative Committee in Economic Development in Southeast Asia under the Colombo plan in Ceylon in 1957. In 1952, he left the government service and joined the Philippine American Life and General Insurance Company as financial vice-president and vice-chairman of its investment committee. Soon, he was accorded the same respect he earned during his service with the government. He was elected either as chairman, president or board member of various companies involved in insurance, food processing, marketing, oil exploration, plywood manufacture, logging, textile, meat packing, glass making, oil refining, banking, telecommunications, etc. His leadership in business and industry reached its peak when he was elected president of the Philippine Chamber of Industries and the Management Association of the Philippines. He was also attributed to the successful transfer of the Manila Electric Company to Filipino control from General Public Utilities of the United States, and the Filipinization of the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company. He became a member of the Joint Legislative Executive Tax Commission in 1966. From 1969 to 1970, President Marcos appointed him as Secretary of the Department of Commerce and Industry (now the Department of Trade and Industry). In 1970, he was appointed chairman of the Development Bank of the Philippines. Upon assuming his position as Chairman of DBP, he ordered the investigation of several major firms that failed to pay the DBP millions of pesos in overdue obligations. Because of this, he was considered as one of the radical chairmen the DBP ever had. Also as head of the DBP, he helped agricultural and industrial enterprises through sound financing schemes. He was also responsible for orienting the institutional objective of development to the countryside to insure that the rural people would enjoy the benefits of economic growth.  Death  On July 14, 1976, Chairman Virata died in Houston, Texas, where he was treated of a lingering illness, leaving his wife the former Marie Theresa “Bebe” Gallardo Lammoglia, and two children, Luis Juan Virata (married Elizabeth Torres Cu-Unjieng) and Giovanna “Vanna” Virata. JV de Ocampo assumed Virata’s unfinished term at the DBP. In honoring Virata, Chairman de Ocampo said: “In the death of Chairman Leonides Virata, we have lost a esteemed leader in the country’s economic life. He was a force in our development direction…. Chairman Virata was an articulate exponent of an economic strategy designed to improve the quality of life of our people and he gave of himself liberally to this pursuits toward the end. Shortly before his death, he sought to give deeper and massive meaning to the DBP’s countryside development program which he himself initiated in line with national policy.”  Honors and awards  * In 1963, the Philippine Women's University awarded him an honorary doctorate degree. * In recognition of his long and distinguished service to the country in the fields of banking, finance, trade and industry, which spanned a period of 33 years, President Marcos posthumously conferred on him the Presidential Merit Medal. * The Leonides S. Virata Memorial School (LSVMS) in Palawan was named after him.
