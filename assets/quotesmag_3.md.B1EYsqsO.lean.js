A subset of NSB's sixteen Class 70 electric multiple units were assigned for the service. History The service was introduced in 1992 when the first nine Class 70 units were delivered. The new services would offer hourly headway on the involved routes, bypassing many smaller stops that would be served by commuter trains. The extension to Göteborg was only offered thrice each day. In January 1999, the ICE brand was disbanded. In April 1999, the former ICE routes became part of the Agenda brand.

Career  Koudelka's first world cup start was in Kuusamo on 24 November 2006. He finished in 31st position. He ended the season 39th in the world cup standings with 87 points. The following season he finished 17th in the world cup standings with 411 points. In the 2008/09 season he finished 16th with 403 points. He finished tied for 63rd in the 2009/10 campaign with just 20 points. He finished in 16th place in the world cup standings for a second time in the 2010/11 season after scoring 382 points. Koudelka's best finish at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships was fifth in the team large hill event at Liberec in 2009. At the 2010 Winter Olympics, he finished seventh in the team large hill, 12th in the individual normal hill, and 23rd in the individual large hill events. He has finished fourth in the World Cup on five occasions since 2007, most recently in Lillehammer on the smaller hill. In 2009 he was 2nd in the Summer Grand Prix in Courchevel. In 2011 he was third in a ski flying World Cup competition in Harrachov, when he also set his personal best, 211 m. In December 2011 Koudelka fell heavily, when he lost his binding while in the air. Koudelka tried to get up after the accident but passed out and was taken to hospital. However, he returned to action in Engelberg a week later. On 12 February 2012, Koudelka finished as runner up in Willingen to improve his best position in an FIS World Cup event. Koudelka is recognised as an aggressive jumper but despite his all or nothing approach, Koudelka has established himself as a consistent performer with many top 10 finishes in the 2011/12 season. Koudelka has jumped 143 m in Jested, Liberec K120, which is the hill record. Koudelka's skis are made by Fischer, his bindings by WinAir and his boots by Rass. Koudelka speaks both Czech and German.

The evolution of statistics was, in particular, intimately connected with the development of European states following the peace of Westphalia (1648), and with the development of probability theory, which put statistics on a firm theoretical basis (see history of probability). In early times, the meaning was restricted to information about states, particularly demographics such as population. This was later extended to include all collections of information of all types, and later still it was extended to include the analysis and interpretation of such data. In modern terms, \\"statistics\\" means both sets of collected information, as in national accounts and temperature records, and analytical work which requires statistical inference. Statistical activities are often associated with models expressed using probabilities, hence the connection with probability theory. The large requirements of data processing have made statistics a key application of computing; see history of computing hardware. A number of statistical concepts have an important impact on a wide range of sciences. These include the design of experiments and approaches to statistical inference such as Bayesian inference, each of which can be considered to have their own sequence in the development of the ideas underlying modern statistics. Introduction By the 18th century, the term \\"statistics\\" designated the systematic collection of demographic and economic data by states. For at least two millennia, these data were mainly tabulations of human and material resources that might be taxed or put to military use. In the early 19th century, collection intensified, and the meaning of \\"statistics\\" broadened to include the discipline concerned with the collection, summary, and analysis of data. Today, data is collected and statistics are computed and widely distributed in government, business, most of the sciences and sports, and even for many pastimes. Electronic computers have expedited more elaborate statistical computation even as they have facilitated the collection and aggregation of data. A single data analyst may have available a set of data-files with millions of records, each with dozens or hundreds of separate measurements. These were collected over time from computer activity (for example, a stock exchange) or from computerized sensors, point-of-sale registers, and so on. Computers then produce simple, accurate summaries, and allow more tedious analyses, such as those that require inverting a large matrix or perform hundreds of steps of iteration, that would never be attempted by hand. Faster computing has allowed statisticians to develop \\"computer-intensive\\" methods which may look at all permutations, or use randomization to look at 10,000 permutations of a problem, to estimate answers that are not easy to quantify by theory alone. The term \\"mathematical statistics\\" designates the mathematical theories of probability and statistical inference, which are used in statistical practice. The relation between statistics and probability theory developed rather late, however. In the 19th century, statistics increasingly used probability theory, whose initial results were found in the 17th and 18th centuries, particularly in the analysis of games of chance (gambling). By 1800, astronomy used probability models and statistical theories, particularly the method of least squares. Early probability theory and statistics was systematized in the 19th century and statistical reasoning and probability models were used by social scientists to advance the new sciences of experimental psychology and sociology, and by physical scientists in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. The development of statistical reasoning was closely associated with the development of inductive logic and the scientific method, which are concerns that move statisticians away from the narrower area of mathematical statistics. Much of the theoretical work was readily available by the time computers were available to exploit them. By the 1970s, Johnson and Kotz produced a four-volume Compendium on Statistical Distributions (1st ed., 1969-1972), which is still an invaluable resource. Applied statistics can be regarded as not a field of mathematics but an autonomous mathematical science, like computer science and operations research. Unlike mathematics, statistics had its origins in public administration. Applications arose early in demography and economics; large areas of micro- and macro-economics today are \\"statistics\\" with an emphasis on time-series analyses. With its emphasis on learning from data and making best predictions, statistics also has been shaped by areas of academic research including psychological testing, medicine and epidemiology. The ideas of statistical testing have considerable overlap with decision science. With its concerns with searching and effectively presenting data, statistics has overlap with information science and computer science. Etymology :Look up statistics in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. The term statistics is ultimately derived from the New Latin statisticum collegium (\\"council of state\\") and the Italian word statista (\\"statesman\\" or \\"politician\\"). The German Statistik, first introduced by Gottfried Achenwall (1749), originally designated the analysis of data about the state, signifying the \\"science of state\\" (then called political arithmetic in English). It acquired the meaning of the collection and classification of data generally in the early 19th century. It was introduced into English in 1791 by Sir John Sinclair when he published the first of 21 volumes titled Statistical Account of Scotland. Thus, the original principal purpose of Statistik was data to be used by governmental and (often centralized) administrative bodies. The collection of data about states and localities continues, largely through national and international statistical services. In particular, censuses provide frequently updated information about the population. The first book to have 'statistics' in its title was \\"Contributions to Vital Statistics\\" (1845) by Francis GP Neison, actuary to the Medical Invalid and General Life Office. Origins in probability theory Basic forms of statistics have been used since the beginning of civilization. Early empires often collated censuses of the population or recorded the trade in various commodities. The Han Dynasty and the Roman Empire were some of the first states to extensively gather data on the size of the empire's population, geographical area and wealth. The use of statistical methods dates back to at least the 5th century BCE. The historian Thucydides in his History of the Peloponnesian War describes how the Athenians calculated the height of the wall of Platea by counting the number of bricks in an unplastered section of the wall sufficiently near them to be able to count them. The count was repeated several times by a number of soldiers. The most frequent value (in modern terminology - the mode ) so determined was taken to be the most likely value of the number of bricks. Multiplying this value by the height of the bricks used in the wall allowed the Athenians to determine the height of the ladders necessary to scale the walls. Forms of probability and statistics were developed by Al-Khalil (717–786 CE), an Arab mathematician studying cryptology. He wrote the Book of Cryptographic Messages which contains the first use of permutations and combinations to list all possible Arabic words with and without vowels. The earliest writing on statistics was found in a 9th-century Arabic book entitled Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages, written by Al-Kindi (801–873). In his book, Al-Kindi gave a detailed description of how to use statistics and frequency analysis to decipher encrypted messages. This text arguably gave rise to the birth of both statistics and cryptanalysis.Ibrahim A. Al-Kadi \\"The origins of cryptology: The Arab contributions\\", Cryptologia, 16(2) (April 1992) pp. 97-126. Al-Kindi also made the earliest known use of statistical inference, while he and other Arab cryptologists developed the early statistical methods for decoding encrypted messages. An important contribution of Ibn Adlan (1187–1268) was on sample size for use of frequency analysis. The Trial of the Pyx is a test of the purity of the coinage of the Royal Mint which has been held on a regular basis since the 12th century. The Trial itself is based on statistical sampling methods. After minting a series of coins - originally from ten pounds of silver - a single coin was placed in the Pyx - a box in Westminster Abbey. After a given period - now once a year - the coins are removed and weighed. A sample of coins removed from the box are then tested for purity. The Nuova Cronica, a 14th-century history of Florence by the Florentine banker and official Giovanni Villani, includes much statistical information on population, ordinances, commerce and trade, education, and religious facilities and has been described as the first introduction of statistics as a positive element in history,Villani, Giovanni. Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD. Retrieved on 2008-03-04. though neither the term nor the concept of statistics as a specific field yet existed. But this was proven to be incorrect after the rediscovery of Al-Kindi's book on frequency analysis. The arithmetic mean, although a concept known to the Greeks, was not generalised to more than two values until the 16th century. The invention of the decimal system by Simon Stevin in 1585 seems likely to have facilitated these calculations. This method was first adopted in astronomy by Tycho Brahe who was attempting to reduce the errors in his estimates of the locations of various celestial bodies. The idea of the median originated in Edward Wright's book on navigation (Certaine Errors in Navigation) in 1599 in a section concerning the determination of location with a compass. Wright felt that this value was the most likely to be the correct value in a series of observations. Sir William Petty, a 17th-century economist who used early statistical methods to analyse demographic data. The birth of statistics is often dated to 1662, when John Graunt, along with William Petty, developed early human statistical and census methods that provided a framework for modern demography. He produced the first life table, giving probabilities of survival to each age. His book Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality used analysis of the mortality rolls to make the first statistically based estimation of the population of London. He knew that there were around 13,000 funerals per year in London and that three people died per eleven families per year. He estimated from the parish records that the average family size was 8 and calculated that the population of London was about 384,000; this is the first known use of a ratio estimator. Laplace in 1802 estimated the population of France with a similar method; see for details. Although the original scope of statistics was limited to data useful for governance, the approach was extended to many fields of a scientific or commercial nature during the 19th century. The mathematical foundations for the subject heavily drew on the new probability theory, pioneered in the 16th century by Gerolamo Cardano, Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal. Christiaan Huygens (1657) gave the earliest known scientific treatment of the subject. Jakob Bernoulli's Ars Conjectandi (posthumous, 1713) and Abraham de Moivre's The Doctrine of Chances (1718) treated the subject as a branch of mathematics. In his book Bernoulli introduced the idea of representing complete certainty as one and probability as a number between zero and one. A key early application of statistics in the 18th century was to the human sex ratio at birth. John Arbuthnot studied this question in 1710. Arbuthnot examined birth records in London for each of the 82 years from 1629 to 1710. In every year, the number of males born in London exceeded the number of females. Considering more male or more female births as equally likely, the probability of the observed outcome is 0.5^82, or about 1 in 4,8360,0000,0000,0000,0000,0000; in modern terms, the p-value. This is vanishingly small, leading Arbuthnot that this was not due to chance, but to divine providence: \\"From whence it follows, that it is Art, not Chance, that governs.\\" This is and other work by Arbuthnot is credited as \\"the first use of significance tests\\" the first example of reasoning about statistical significance and moral certainty, and \\"… perhaps the first published report of a nonparametric test …\\", specifically the sign test; see details at . The formal study of theory of errors may be traced back to Roger Cotes' Opera Miscellanea (posthumous, 1722), but a memoir prepared by Thomas Simpson in 1755 (printed 1756) first applied the theory to the discussion of errors of observation. The reprint (1757) of this memoir lays down the axioms that positive and negative errors are equally probable, and that there are certain assignable limits within which all errors may be supposed to fall; continuous errors are discussed and a probability curve is given. Simpson discussed several possible distributions of error. He first considered the uniform distribution and then the discrete symmetric triangular distribution followed by the continuous symmetric triangle distribution. Tobias Mayer, in his study of the libration of the moon (Kosmographische Nachrichten, Nuremberg, 1750), invented the first formal method for estimating the unknown quantities by generalized the averaging of observations under identical circumstances to the averaging of groups of similar equations. Roger Joseph Boscovich in 1755 based in his work on the shape of the earth proposed in his book De Litteraria expeditione per pontificiam ditionem ad dimetiendos duos meridiani gradus a PP. Maire et Boscovicli that the true value of a series of observations would be that which minimises the sum of absolute errors. In modern terminology this value is the median. The first example of what later became known as the normal curve was studied by Abraham de Moivre who plotted this curve on November 12, 1733.de Moivre, A. (1738) The doctrine of chances. Woodfall de Moivre was studying the number of heads that occurred when a 'fair' coin was tossed. In 1761 Thomas Bayes proved Bayes' theorem and in 1765 Joseph Priestley invented the first timeline charts. Johann Heinrich Lambert in his 1765 book Anlage zur Architectonic proposed the semicircle as a distribution of errors: : f(x) = \\\\frac{ 1 }{ 2 } \\\\sqrt{ ( 1 - x^2 ) } with -1 < x < 1\\\\. Probability density plots for the Laplace distribution. Pierre-Simon Laplace (1774) made the first attempt to deduce a rule for the combination of observations from the principles of the theory of probabilities. He represented the law of probability of errors by a curve and deduced a formula for the mean of three observations. Laplace in 1774 noted that the frequency of an error could be expressed as an exponential function of its magnitude once its sign was disregarded.Wilson, Edwin Bidwell (1923) \\"First and second laws of error\\", Journal of the American Statistical Association, 18 (143), 841-851 This distribution is now known as the Laplace distribution. Lagrange proposed a parabolic distribution of errors in 1776. Laplace in 1778 published his second law of errors wherein he noted that the frequency of an error was proportional to the exponential of the square of its magnitude. This was subsequently rediscovered by Gauss (possibly in 1795) and is now best known as the normal distribution which is of central importance in statistics.Havil J (2003) Gamma: Exploring Euler's Constant. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, p. 157 This distribution was first referred to as the normal distribution by C. S. Peirce in 1873 who was studying measurement errors when an object was dropped onto a wooden base.C. S. Peirce (1873) Theory of errors of observations. Report of the Superintendent US Coast Survey, Washington, Government Printing Office. Appendix no. 21: 200-224 He chose the term normal because of its frequent occurrence in naturally occurring variables. Lagrange also suggested in 1781 two other distributions for errors - a raised cosine distribution and a logarithmic distribution. Laplace gave (1781) a formula for the law of facility of error (a term due to Joseph Louis Lagrange, 1774), but one which led to unmanageable equations. Daniel Bernoulli (1778) introduced the principle of the maximum product of the probabilities of a system of concurrent errors. In 1786 William Playfair (1759-1823) introduced the idea of graphical representation into statistics. He invented the line chart, bar chart and histogram and incorporated them into his works on economics, the Commercial and Political Atlas. This was followed in 1795 by his invention of the pie chart and circle chart which he used to display the evolution of England's imports and exports. These latter charts came to general attention when he published examples in his Statistical Breviary in 1801. Laplace, in an investigation of the motions of Saturn and Jupiter in 1787, generalized Mayer's method by using different linear combinations of a single group of equations. In 1791 Sir John Sinclair introduced the term 'statistics' into English in his Statistical Accounts of Scotland. In 1802 Laplace estimated the population of France to be 28,328,612.Cochran W.G. (1978) \\"Laplace's ratio estimators\\". pp 3-10. In David H.A., (ed). Contributions to Survey Sampling and Applied Statistics: papers in honor of H. O. Hartley. Academic Press, New York He calculated this figure using the number of births in the previous year and census data for three communities. The census data of these communities showed that they had 2,037,615 persons and that the number of births were 71,866. Assuming that these samples were representative of France, Laplace produced his estimate for the entire population. Carl Friedrich Gauss, mathematician who developed the method of least squares in 1809. The method of least squares, which was used to minimize errors in data measurement, was published independently by Adrien-Marie Legendre (1805), Robert Adrain (1808), and Carl Friedrich Gauss (1809). Gauss had used the method in his famous 1801 prediction of the location of the dwarf planet Ceres. The observations that Gauss based his calculations on were made by the Italian monk Piazzi. The method of least squares was preceded by the use a median regression slope. This method minimizing the sum of the absolute deviances. A method of estimating this slope was invented by Roger Joseph Boscovich in 1760 which he applied to astronomy. The term probable error (der wahrscheinliche Fehler) - the median deviation from the mean - was introduced in 1815 by the German astronomer Frederik Wilhelm Bessel. Antoine Augustin Cournot in 1843 was the first to use the term median (valeur médiane) for the value that divides a probability distribution into two equal halves. Other contributors to the theory of errors were Ellis (1844), De Morgan (1864), Glaisher (1872), and Giovanni Schiaparelli (1875). Peters's (1856) formula for r, the \\"probable error\\" of a single observation was widely used and inspired early robust statistics (resistant to outliers: see Peirce's criterion). In the 19th century authors on statistical theory included Laplace, S. Lacroix (1816), Littrow (1833), Dedekind (1860), Helmert (1872), Laurent (1873), Liagre, Didion, De Morgan and Boole. Gustav Theodor Fechner used the median (Centralwerth) in sociological and psychological phenomena.Keynes, JM (1921) A treatise on probability. Pt II Ch XVII §5 (p 201) It had earlier been used only in astronomy and related fields. Francis Galton used the English term median for the first time in 1881 having earlier used the terms middle-most value in 1869 and the medium in 1880.Galton F (1881) Report of the Anthropometric Committee pp 245-260. Report of the 51st Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science Adolphe Quetelet (1796–1874), another important founder of statistics, introduced the notion of the \\"average man\\" (l'homme moyen) as a means of understanding complex social phenomena such as crime rates, marriage rates, and suicide rates.Stigler (1986, Chapter 5: Quetelet's Two Attempts) The first tests of the normal distribution were invented by the German statistician Wilhelm Lexis in the 1870s. The only data sets available to him that he was able to show were normally distributed were birth rates. =Development of modern statistics= Although the origins of statistical theory lie in the 18th-century advances in probability, the modern field of statistics only emerged in the late-19th and early-20th century in three stages. The first wave, at the turn of the century, was led by the work of Francis Galton and Karl Pearson, who transformed statistics into a rigorous mathematical discipline used for analysis, not just in science, but in industry and politics as well. The second wave of the 1910s and 20s was initiated by William Sealy Gosset, and reached its culmination in the insights of Ronald Fisher. This involved the development of better design of experiments models, hypothesis testing and techniques for use with small data samples. The final wave, which mainly saw the refinement and expansion of earlier developments, emerged from the collaborative work between Egon Pearson and Jerzy Neyman in the 1930s. Today, statistical methods are applied in all fields that involve decision making, for making accurate inferences from a collated body of data and for making decisions in the face of uncertainty based on statistical methodology. The original logo of the Royal Statistical Society, founded in 1834. The first statistical bodies were established in the early 19th century. The Royal Statistical Society was founded in 1834 and Florence Nightingale, its first female member, pioneered the application of statistical analysis to health problems for the furtherance of epidemiological understanding and public health practice. However, the methods then used would not be considered as modern statistics today. The Oxford scholar Francis Ysidro Edgeworth's book, Metretike: or The Method of Measuring Probability and Utility (1887) dealt with probability as the basis of inductive reasoning, and his later works focused on the 'philosophy of chance'.(Stigler 1986, Chapter 9: The Next Generation: Edgeworth) His first paper on statistics (1883) explored the law of error (normal distribution), and his Methods of Statistics (1885) introduced an early version of the t distribution, the Edgeworth expansion, the Edgeworth series, the method of variate transformation and the asymptotic theory of maximum likelihood estimates. The Norwegian Anders Nicolai Kiær introduced the concept of stratified sampling in 1895.Bellhouse DR (1988) A brief history of random sampling methods. Handbook of statistics. Vol 6 pp 1-14 Elsevier Arthur Lyon Bowley introduced new methods of data sampling in 1906 when working on social statistics. Although statistical surveys of social conditions had started with Charles Booth's \\"Life and Labour of the People in London\\" (1889-1903) and Seebohm Rowntree's \\"Poverty, A Study of Town Life\\" (1901), Bowley's, key innovation consisted of the use of random sampling techniques. His efforts culminated in his New Survey of London Life and Labour. Francis Galton is credited as one of the principal founders of statistical theory. His contributions to the field included introducing the concepts of standard deviation, correlation, regression and the application of these methods to the study of the variety of human characteristics - height, weight, eyelash length among others. He found that many of these could be fitted to a normal curve distribution. Galton submitted a paper to Nature in 1907 on the usefulness of the median. He examined the accuracy of 787 guesses of the weight of an ox at a country fair. The actual weight was 1208 pounds: the median guess was 1198. The guesses were markedly non-normally distributed. Karl Pearson, the founder of mathematical statistics. Galton's publication of Natural Inheritance in 1889 sparked the interest of a brilliant mathematician, Karl Pearson,Stigler (1986, Chapter 10: Pearson and Yule) then working at University College London, and he went on to found the discipline of mathematical statistics. He emphasised the statistical foundation of scientific laws and promoted its study and his laboratory attracted students from around the world attracted by his new methods of analysis, including Udny Yule. His work grew to encompass the fields of biology, epidemiology, anthropometry, medicine and social history. In 1901, with Walter Weldon, founder of biometry, and Galton, he founded the journal Biometrika as the first journal of mathematical statistics and biometry. His work, and that of Galton's, underpins many of the 'classical' statistical methods which are in common use today, including the Correlation coefficient, defined as a product- moment; the method of moments for the fitting of distributions to samples; Pearson's system of continuous curves that forms the basis of the now conventional continuous probability distributions; Chi distance a precursor and special case of the Mahalanobis distance and P-value, defined as the probability measure of the complement of the ball with the hypothesized value as center point and chi distance as radius. He also introduced the term 'standard deviation'. He also founded the statistical hypothesis testing theory, Pearson's chi-squared test and principal component analysis.Jolliffe, I. T. (2002). Principal Component Analysis, 2nd ed. New York: Springer-Verlag. In 1911 he founded the world's first university statistics department at University College London. The second wave of mathematical statistics was pioneered by Ronald Fisher who wrote two textbooks, Statistical Methods for Research Workers, published in 1925 and The Design of Experiments in 1935, that were to define the academic discipline in universities around the world. He also systematized previous results, putting them on a firm mathematical footing. In his 1918 seminal paper The Correlation between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance, the first use to use the statistical term, variance. In 1919, at Rothamsted Experimental Station he started a major study of the extensive collections of data recorded over many years. This resulted in a series of reports under the general title Studies in Crop Variation. In 1930 he published The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection where he applied statistics to evolution. Over the next seven years, he pioneered the principles of the design of experiments (see below) and elaborated his studies of analysis of variance. He furthered his studies of the statistics of small samples. Perhaps even more important, he began his systematic approach of the analysis of real data as the springboard for the development of new statistical methods. He developed computational algorithms for analyzing data from his balanced experimental designs. In 1925, this work resulted in the publication of his first book, Statistical Methods for Research Workers.Box, R. A. Fisher, pp 93–166 This book went through many editions and translations in later years, and it became the standard reference work for scientists in many disciplines. In 1935, this book was followed by The Design of Experiments, which was also widely used. In addition to analysis of variance, Fisher named and promoted the method of maximum likelihood estimation. Fisher also originated the concepts of sufficiency, ancillary statistics, Fisher's linear discriminator and Fisher information. His article On a distribution yielding the error functions of several well known statistics (1924) presented Pearson's chi-squared test and William Sealy Gosset's t in the same framework as the Gaussian distribution, and his own parameter in the analysis of variance Fisher's z-distribution (more commonly used decades later in the form of the F distribution). The 5% level of significance appears to have been introduced by Fisher in 1925.Fisher RA (1925) Statistical methods for research workers, Edinburgh: Oliver & Boyd Fisher stated that deviations exceeding twice the standard deviation are regarded as significant. Before this deviations exceeding three times the probable error were considered significant. For a symmetrical distribution the probable error is half the interquartile range. For a normal distribution the probable error is approximately 2/3 the standard deviation. It appears that Fisher's 5% criterion was rooted in previous practice. Other important contributions at this time included Charles Spearman's rank correlation coefficient that was a useful extension of the Pearson correlation coefficient. William Sealy Gosset, the English statistician better known under his pseudonym of Student, introduced Student's t-distribution, a continuous probability distribution useful in situations where the sample size is small and population standard deviation is unknown. Egon Pearson (Karl's son) and Jerzy Neyman introduced the concepts of \\"Type II\\" error, power of a test and confidence intervals. Jerzy Neyman in 1934 showed that stratified random sampling was in general a better method of estimation than purposive (quota) sampling.Neyman, J (1934) On the two different aspects of the representative method: The method of stratified sampling and the method of purposive selection. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society 97 (4) 557-625 Design of experiments James Lind carried out the first ever clinical trial in 1747, in an effort to find a treatment for scurvy. In 1747, while serving as surgeon on HM Bark Salisbury, James Lind carried out a controlled experiment to develop a cure for scurvy. In this study his subjects' cases \\"were as similar as I could have them\\", that is he provided strict entry requirements to reduce extraneous variation. The men were paired, which provided blocking. From a modern perspective, the main thing that is missing is randomized allocation of subjects to treatments. Lind is today often described as a one- factor-at-a-time experimenter. Similar one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) experimentation was performed at the Rothamsted Research Station in the 1840s by Sir John Lawes to determine the optimal inorganic fertilizer for use on wheat. A theory of statistical inference was developed by Charles S. Peirce in \\"Illustrations of the Logic of Science\\" (1877–1878) and \\"A Theory of Probable Inference\\" (1883), two publications that emphasized the importance of randomization-based inference in statistics. In another study, Peirce randomly assigned volunteers to a blinded, repeated-measures design to evaluate their ability to discriminate weights. Peirce's experiment inspired other researchers in psychology and education, which developed a research tradition of randomized experiments in laboratories and specialized textbooks in the 1800s. Peirce also contributed the first English-language publication on an optimal design for regression-models in 1876., actually published 1879, NOAA PDF Eprint. Reprinted in Collected Papers 7, paragraphs 139–157, also in Writings 4, pp. 72–78, and in A pioneering optimal design for polynomial regression was suggested by Gergonne in 1815. In 1918 Kirstine Smith published optimal designs for polynomials of degree six (and less). The use of a sequence of experiments, where the design of each may depend on the results of previous experiments, including the possible decision to stop experimenting, was pioneeredJohnson, N.L. (1961). \\"Sequential analysis: a survey.\\" Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A. Vol. 124 (3), 372-411\\\\.

(pages 151-180) One specific type of sequential design is the \\"two-armed bandit\\", generalized to the multi-armed bandit, on which early work was done by Herbert Robbins in 1952. The term \\"design of experiments\\" (DOE) derives from early statistical work performed by Sir Ronald Fisher. He was described by Anders Hald as \\"a genius who almost single-handedly created the foundations for modern statistical science.\\"Hald, Anders (1998) A History of Mathematical Statistics. New York: Wiley. Fisher initiated the principles of design of experiments and elaborated on his studies of \\"analysis of variance\\". Perhaps even more important, Fisher began his systematic approach to the analysis of real data as the springboard for the development of new statistical methods. He began to pay particular attention to the labour involved in the necessary computations performed by hand, and developed methods that were as practical as they were founded in rigour. In 1925, this work culminated in the publication of his first book, Statistical Methods for Research Workers.Box, Joan Fisher (1978) R. A. Fisher: The Life of a Scientist, Wiley. (pp 93–166) This went into many editions and translations in later years, and became a standard reference work for scientists in many disciplines. A methodology for designing experiments was proposed by Ronald A. Fisher, in his innovative book The Design of Experiments (1935) which also became a standard. As an example, he described how to test the hypothesis that a certain lady could distinguish by flavour alone whether the milk or the tea was first placed in the cup. While this sounds like a frivolous application, it allowed him to illustrate the most important ideas of experimental design: see Lady tasting tea. Agricultural science advances served to meet the combination of larger city populations and fewer farms. But for crop scientists to take due account of widely differing geographical growing climates and needs, it was important to differentiate local growing conditions. To extrapolate experiments on local crops to a national scale, they had to extend crop sample testing economically to overall populations. As statistical methods advanced (primarily the efficacy of designed experiments instead of one-factor-at-a-time experimentation), representative factorial design of experiments began to enable the meaningful extension, by inference, of experimental sampling results to the population as a whole. But it was hard to decide how representative was the crop sample chosen. Factorial design methodology showed how to estimate and correct for any random variation within the sample and also in the data collection procedures. Bayesian statistics Pierre-Simon, marquis de Laplace, the main early developer of Bayesian statistics. The term Bayesian refers to Thomas Bayes (1702-1761), who proved that probabilistic limits could be placed on an unknown event. However it was Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749-1827) who introduced (as principle VI) what is now called Bayes' theorem and applied it to celestial mechanics, medical statistics, reliability, and jurisprudence.Stigler (1986, Chapter 3: Inverse Probability) When insufficient knowledge was available to specify an informed prior, Laplace used uniform priors, according to his \\"principle of insufficient reason\\".Hald (1998) Laplace assumed uniform priors for mathematical simplicity rather than for philosophical reasons. Laplace also introduced primitive versions of conjugate priors and the theorem of von Mises and Bernstein, according to which the posteriors corresponding to initially differing priors ultimately agree, as the number of observations increases. Lucien Le Cam (1986) Asymptotic Methods in Statistical Decision Theory: Pages 336 and 618-621 (von Mises and Bernstein). This early Bayesian inference, which used uniform priors following Laplace's principle of insufficient reason, was called \\"inverse probability\\" (because it infers backwards from observations to parameters, or from effects to causesStephen. E. Fienberg, (2006) When did Bayesian Inference become \\"Bayesian\\"? Bayesian Analysis, 1 (1), 1-40\\\\. See page 5.). After the 1920s, inverse probability was largely supplanted by a collection of methods that were developed by Ronald A. Fisher, Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson. Their methods came to be called frequentist statistics. Fisher rejected the Bayesian view, writing that \\"the theory of inverse probability is founded upon an error, and must be wholly rejected\\". At the end of his life, however, Fisher expressed greater respect for the essay of Bayes, which Fisher believed to have anticipated his own, fiducial approach to probability; Fisher still maintained that Laplace's views on probability were \\"fallacious rubbish\\". Neyman started out as a \\"quasi-Bayesian\\", but subsequently developed confidence intervals (a key method in frequentist statistics) because \\"the whole theory would look nicer if it were built from the start without reference to Bayesianism and priors\\". The word Bayesian appeared around 1950, and by the 1960s it became the term preferred by those dissatisfied with the limitations of frequentist statistics.Jeff Miller, \\"Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics (B)\\" \\"The term Bayesian entered circulation around 1950. R. A. Fisher used it in the notes he wrote to accompany the papers in his Contributions to Mathematical Statistics (1950). Fisher thought Bayes's argument was all but extinct for the only recent work to take it seriously was Harold Jeffreys's Theory of Probability (1939). In 1951 L. J. Savage, reviewing Wald's Statistical Decisions Functions, referred to \\"modern, or unBayesian, statistical theory\\" (\\"The Theory of Statistical Decision,\\" Journal of the American Statistical Association, 46, p. 58.). Soon after, however, Savage changed from being an unBayesian to being a Bayesian.\\" In the 20th century, the ideas of Laplace were further developed in two different directions, giving rise to objective and subjective currents in Bayesian practice. In the objectivist stream, the statistical analysis depends on only the model assumed and the data analysed. No subjective decisions need to be involved. In contrast, \\"subjectivist\\" statisticians deny the possibility of fully objective analysis for the general case. In the further development of Laplace's ideas, subjective ideas predate objectivist positions. The idea that 'probability' should be interpreted as 'subjective degree of belief in a proposition' was proposed, for example, by John Maynard Keynes in the early 1920s. This idea was taken further by Bruno de Finetti in Italy (Fondamenti Logici del Ragionamento Probabilistico, 1930) and Frank Ramsey in Cambridge (The Foundations of Mathematics, 1931).Gillies, D. (2000), Philosophical Theories of Probability. Routledge. pp 50-1 The approach was devised to solve problems with the frequentist definition of probability but also with the earlier, objectivist approach of Laplace. The subjective Bayesian methods were further developed and popularized in the 1950s by L.J. Savage. Objective Bayesian inference was further developed by Harold Jeffreys at the University of Cambridge. His seminal book \\"Theory of probability\\" first appeared in 1939 and played an important role in the revival of the Bayesian view of probability.E. T. Jaynes. Probability Theory: The Logic of Science Cambridge University Press, (2003). In 1957, Edwin Jaynes promoted the concept of maximum entropy for constructing priors, which is an important principle in the formulation of objective methods, mainly for discrete problems. In 1965, Dennis Lindley's 2-volume work \\"Introduction to Probability and Statistics from a Bayesian Viewpoint\\" brought Bayesian methods to a wide audience. In 1979, José-Miguel Bernardo introduced reference analysis, which offers a general applicable framework for objective analysis.Bernardo, J. M. and Smith, A. F. M. (1994). \\"Bayesian Theory\\". Chichester: Wiley. Other well-known proponents of Bayesian probability theory include I.J. Good, B.O. Koopman, Howard Raiffa, Robert Schlaifer and Alan Turing. In the 1980s, there was a dramatic growth in research and applications of Bayesian methods, mostly attributed to the discovery of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, which removed many of the computational problems, and an increasing interest in nonstandard, complex applications. Despite growth of Bayesian research, most undergraduate teaching is still based on frequentist statistics. Nonetheless, Bayesian methods are widely accepted and used, such as for example in the field of machine learning.Bishop, C.M. (2007) Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning.

The sixth Lieutenant Governor, state legislator, Speaker of the State House of Representatives, was the only person in Georgia to win contested elections in all three branches of state government - legislative, executive, and judicial. Early years Born in Mitchell County, Georgia, Smith attended Middle Georgia College and Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College. On August 26, 1940, he joined the United States Navy, having attained the rank of lieutenant commander and receiving the Naval Merit Unit citation. Following military service, Smith graduated from the University of Georgia School of Law in 1948. Upon graduation he practiced law in Cairo in Grady County in southwestern Georgia. In addition to his private law practice, he served as county attorney, solicitor of the State Court of Grady County, Cairo city attorney, and attorney for the Grady County Board of Education. Political career Smith's political career began when he was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives from Grady County in 1958. He served as a state representative until 1966, eventually rising to the position of its Speaker from 1963 to 1966. Smith won the Democratic Party nomination for lieutenant governor in the 1966 election. Because the Georgia Democratic Party dominated state politics at the time, winning the primary virtually assured victory in the general election. Smith served as the state's second-ranking executive officer under Governor Lester Maddox from January 11, 1967 to January 12, 1971. Smith was defeated for re-election as lieutenant governor by Maddox in 1970, as Maddox was prohibited from seeking re-election to the governorship, which then passed to Jimmy Carter of Plains. After leaving office, Smith returned to the legal world, initially in private practice in Marietta in suburban Cobb County near Atlanta. He ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1974, having lost his party nomination to George Busbee. In 1976, he was elected to the Georgia Court of Appeals for a six-year term. In 1980, he was elected as a justice of the Georgia Supreme Court. He served on the high court from 1981 until 1991.Georgia Supreme Court history Despite his advanced age at the time of his death, Smith was serving on the Executive Committee of the Appellate Judges Conference. Smith's portrait was unveiled in the rotunda of the State Capitol in Atlanta on May 12, 1980, in accordance with a Joint Resolution passed by the Georgia House and Senate. Smith was also District Governor of the Georgia Kiwanis in 1960 and has served on the Board of Trustees of the National Arthritis Foundation and as chairman of its National Government Affairs Committee. Smith was called \\"George T.\\" to distinguish himself from a Georgia politician with a similar name, George L.

Running parallel to the Østfold Line, it will be engineered for . Terminal stations will be Oslo Central Station and Ski Station. Most of the line, , will be in a single tunnel, which will be the longest railway tunnel in the country. Construction started in 2014, and is estimated to be completed by December 2022. The Follo Line will increase capacity from twelve to forty trains per hour along the South Corridor, and will allow express and regional trains to decrease travel time from Ski to Oslo from 22 to 11 minutes. The line was prospected to cost over 26 billion Norwegian krone (NOK) in 2014. The project is a continuation of the Norwegian National Rail Administration's plan to build four tracks along the three main corridors out of Oslo; the Gardermoen Line was completed in 1998, and the Asker Line was completed in 2011. Between 1989 and 1996, the Østfold Line south of Ski to Moss was upgraded to double track and higher speeds. To take full advantage of this and allow the rest of the Østfold Line to be upgraded for high speeds, it is necessary to increase capacity through the bottleneck from Oslo to Ski. The first plans for the Follo Line were launched in 1995, and also included an intermediate station at Vevelstad and Kolbotn. The new line is predicted to increase rush hour rail ridership 63%, and increased freight on rail would remove 750 trucks daily from European Route E18. Background The first railway in the Follo district was the Østfold Line of the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) that opened on 2 January 1879, between Oslo East Station and Halden. Later the same year, the line was extended to the Swedish border, where it connected to the Norway/Vänern Line. The importance of Ski Station increased on 24 November 1882, when it became the station where the Eastern Østfold Line split, and went via Inner Østfold to Sarpsborg, where the two lines reconnected. Electrification of the section from Oslo to Kolbotn was completed on 18 January 1937, and the section to Ski finished in 1939; the whole Østfold line was completed in 1940. Between 1924 and 1939, NSB built double track along the route between Ski and Oslo. From 1989 to 1996, NSB upgraded the track to double track from Ski to Sandbuka, just north of Moss. This section is capable of speeds of , however the maximum is due to short distances between stops and limitations of the rolling stock. In 1992, the Norwegian Parliament decided to build the first high-speed railway in Norway, from Oslo via the new Oslo Airport, Gardermoen to Eidsvoll. This line would run parallel to the Hoved Line, increasing the speed and capacity along the route. Fast express and regional trains could run along the new section, while slower commuter trains used the old tracks and could make many stops without disturbing other traffic. Projects were launched during the 1990s to create similar high-speed bypasses from Oslo to Ski, and from Skøyen (west of Oslo) to Asker. Construction of the latter—christened the Asker Line—started in 2001; the first section from Asker to Sandvika opened in 2005 , the second section to Lysaker opened in 2011. The Østfold Line between Oslo and Ski remains the largest bottle-neck on the Norwegian railway network. The line restrains the track to twelve trains per hour (six per direction) and hinders freight trains from using it during rush hour. The bottleneck occurs because there are up to four trains each hour making stops at all stations, and these stops delay all express and regional trains that follow. Travel time is 22 minutes for direct trains to Ski, and 31 minutes for commuter trains with a speed limit of along most of the line. Capacity on the upgraded double track from Ski to Moss cannot be fully utilized due to the limitations along the section from Ski to Oslo, and further growth in the number of freight trains along the South Corridor to Sweden and Continental Europe is impossible without reducing the number of passenger trains. Despite the existing double track all the way from Oslo to Moss, a further upgrade southwards will not be able to increase capacity past the current single train per hour to Fredrikstad, Sarpsborg and Halden. The most optimistic plans involve finishing the first upgrades of track south of Moss simultaneously with the Follo Line. The Rail Administration and Ministry of Transport is working on proposals for a high-speed railway between Oslo and Gothenburg in Sweden. This line would most likely use the Follo Line for the initial distance from Oslo. Route Map of the existing and new line The initial plan from 1995 involved two intermediate stations, at Vevelstad and Kolbotn. The plans also suggested building the line in two phases, first between Ski and Kolbotn, and then from Kolbotn to Oslo. In 2008, the National Rail Administration announced two possible plans for the right-of-way—both predominantly in tunnel. The one proposal included Kolbotn, the other did not. Both excluded Vevelstad as a station on the new line, since the station could not develop as a hub, and would still keep services along the existing commuter line. A report from Det Norske Veritas published in 2008, and ordered by the Rail Administration, concluded that neither a station at Vevelstad or at Kolbotn could support the extra cost of construction. A direct line with no intermediate stops is estimated to cost NOK 11 billion, while a line via Kolbotn would cost 13.5 billion. The report also argued that the intermediate stops would decrease capacity and increase travel time for all passengers departing south of Ski and traveling north. The exclusion of Kolbotn would also increase the importance of Ski as a regional public transport hub. In 2009, the Rail Administration abandoned the plans to build the line via Kolbotn, stating that it was more important to secure a fast connection to Ski. At the same time, they promised to upgrade the existing station at Kolbotn. The rail line is planned for at least , although faster speeds are being considered. The earliest possible construction start is 2014, which could allow completion by 2020/21.Jernbaneverket 2011: Alternativ innføring av Follobanen til Oslo S skal utredeslanguage=Norwegian Ski Station will also be upgraded as part of the project, and will be expanded to six tracks. Plans to connect the Eastern Østfold Line to the slower line were considered where the Eastern Østfold Line diverges from the Østfold Line at Ski. However this has changed so the local trains from Eastern Østfold can travel to Oslo faster along the new tracks. Just south of Oslo Central Station, each of the two tracks will diverge, and follow different routes. The inbound track will hook up with the Østfold Line at Sjursøya, while the outbound track will diverge at Loenga. An additional connection to the Østfold Line will be made at Nordstrand. The Østfold Line connects to the Hoved Line and Loenga–Alnabru Line before reaching Oslo Central Station (Oslo S). If the Kolbotn-alternative for the Follo Line is chosen, the Østfold Line will be rebuilt to follow a similar path to the Kolbotn station, which will require a new station building to accommodate the two lines. For this alternate route the two lines will enter the Kolbotn station at two levels, with the Follo Line running in a tunnel below, and the Østfold Line running at-grade above. Impact The Follo Line will allow the capacity in the South Corridor from Oslo to increase from about twelve to forty trains per hour. Local and freight trains will use the Østfold Line, while regional and express trains will use the Follo Line. Travel time will be reduced from 22 to 11 minutes. With a new line, there will be 11,000 more public transport trips through the corridor; this includes a 67% increase during rush-hour and 43% the rest of the day. This allows a reduction of 5,800 car trips per day and reduces carbon dioxide emissions of 5,474 tonnes. Rush hour capacity would be eight trains per hour to Kolbotn, with four continuing to Ski along the old line. The new line would be served by four trains to Moss, two to Mysen and two to Halden. There would be half the frequency during off-peak hours. The Østfold Line is the railway that connects Norway to Continental Europe, and 80% of all land-based, international freight transport goes through Østfold. Until the Follo Line opens, there cannot be a capacity increase on international freight trains to Norway. The Rail Administration has set a goal of tripling the amount of rail freight by 2040, which for the South Corridor is equal to the removal of 750 trucks per day from European Route E18. The Follo Line will also allow freight trains to pass during rush hour.

It was founded in January 1990, two months after the fall of the Berlin Wall, by Roland Schwertner. The designs for the first collection were drawn up by Susanne Günther, drawing influence from the Bauhaus purist style. NOMOS designs are known for their clean and modernist aesthetic. NOMOS Glashütte is a member of the Deutscher Werkbund, a predecessor of the Bauhaus movement and a group that represents the interests of companies that combine handcraft with industrial production, and design with functionality. The management team is made up of CEO Uwe Ahrendt, a graduate engineer and responsible for production; Judith Borowski, heading up communications and design in Berlin; and Roland Schwertner, who continues to be in charge of sales.  History  left In 1990, Roland Schwertner, an IT expert and photographer from Düsseldorf, registered the trademark NOMOS Glashütte/SA. The first collection of NOMOS watches came out in 1992. NOMOS Glashütte now has three sites in Glashütte, a place renowned for its tradition of watchmaking: The administration department can be found in the former Glashütte station building, while most of the watchmakers are located on Am Erbenhang street. Since 2017, a further manufacturing facility can be found in the Schlottwitz district. Annual production is approximately 20,000 pieces. In its early years, the company focused on manufacturing mechanical watches with hand-wound movements. The basis for these movements was, until 2005, the Swiss-made ETA SA / Peseux 7001. Since April 2005, NOMOS Glashütte has only used in-house movements. Beginning with α (Alpha), a manual winding caliber, the range has since been expanded to include a range of other manual winding movements with additional functions. The first automatic NOMOS watch, the Tangomat, was first introduced in the summer of 2005. In 2014, the company unveiled its own in- house escapement, known as the NOMOS swing system, which made it no longer reliant on Swiss manufacturers.NOMOS Glashütte homepage - With a swing in the movement This new component was gradually introduced into NOMOS’ caliber range. Since 2016, the company has concentrated on upgrading its caliber range with the NOMOS swing system; once upgraded, the calibers receive a name beginning with \\"DUW\\". This acronym stands for \\"Deutsche Uhrenwerke\\" and is intended to highlight the company's in-house caliber production.NOMOS Glashütte homepage - Miracle movements The calibers in the company's neomatik (“new automatic”) series are very thin: NOMOS Glashütte introduced DUW 3001, its tenth in-house caliber, in 2015.NOMOS Glashütte homepage - DUW 3001 At only 3.2 mm in height, this caliber is exclusive to the neomatik series, launched at BaselWorld 2016. The latest movement, DUW 6101, or “neomatik date,” was introduced in 2018. In this year the company also introduced the models Autobahn and Tangente Update, which debuted the neomatik date caliber. At BaselWorld 2019, the company introduced three new collections: the duo series, three new sport watches (two versions of Tangente Sport and one of Club Sport), and three automatic Club Campus models.  Models  The brand started production in 1992 with four basic models (Tangente, Orion, Ludwig, and Tetra).

Awards NOMOS watches have won more than 150 prestigious design awards to date (as of December 2018), including the iF Design Award, the Good Design Award, the red dot Design Award, and the German Design Award. In 2018, NOMOS Glashütte became the first non-Swiss brand after A. Lange & Söhne to win the Grand Prix d’Horlogerie de Genève (GPHG), the Oscars of the watchmaking world, with the Tangente Update model—which has also been awarded the European Product Design Award (EPDA). File:Tangente neomatik 41 Update.jpgTangente Update has won the GPHG, iF Design Award, and EPDA. File:Nomos Glashütte Metro.jpgThe German Design Award 2018 was the sixth prize awarded to the model Metro, released in 2014.  Other  In 1906, a company called \\"Nomos-Uhr-Gesellschaft, Guido Müller & Co.\\" started importing Swiss watches and distributing them with the more prestigious addition “Glashütte/Sachsen”. For a watch company to include “Glashütte” in their name, at least 50% of the caliber must be manufactured in Glashütte; this is up to 95% for NOMOS Glashütte, but was not the case for the Nomos-Uhr-Gesellschaft. The renowned company A. Lange & Söhne took them to court and in 1910 the Nomos-Uhr-Gesellschaft ceased business operations. The Nomos-Uhr-Gesellschaft from the early 1900s and today's NOMOS Glashütte have nothing more than the name Nomos in common.

The station opened to passengers on 1 August 1891 with the opening of the section of the line between Cirencester Watermoor and the junction at Andoversford with the Great Western Railway's Cheltenham Lansdown to Banbury line, which had opened in 1881. History A 1913 Railway Clearing House map of railways in the vicinity of Andoversford & Dowdeswell Andoversford and Dowdeswell was originally called just \\"Dowdeswell\\", though the station was much nearer the village of Andoversford. It was renamed about a year after it opened. The station owed its existence to the awkward relations between the M&SWJR; and the GWR: though the Great Western allowed the newer line running powers over its line from Cheltenham to Andoversford junction, it did not allow the M&SWJR; to stop its trains at Andoversford railway station. The GWR relented in 1904, but by then Andoversford and Dowdeswell was already built, and M&SWJR; trains then stopped at both. The Grouping of 1923 rationalised the situation. The M&SWJR; was allocated to the GWR, and four years later the new owners closed Andoversford and Dowdeswell station to passengers. On nationalisation in 1948 British Railways operated the remaining goods service and passenger trains which continued to pass the station until closure of the line in 1961. After its closure to passengers the station remained opened for goods traffic for a further 35 years to October 1962, outliving the rest of the M&SWJR;, which had closed the previous year. The site today The station building was used for some years afterwards as a transport cafe, but all trace has now gone.

History I Against I was formed by two childhood friends, Ronald van Maren and Jasper Blazer, in the mid-1990s in the Netherlands. Their name comes from the Bad Brains record, I Against I. They signed to Epitaph Records in 1996, the first European group to do so. An EP followed in 1997 and an album in 1998 called Headcleaner, which was recorded in \\"the Blastingroom\\" in Fort Collins, Colorado, the studio of Bill Stevenson of All. The group toured Europe and played South by Southwest in 1998. Their sophomore LP titled I'm a Fucked Up Dancer but My Moods Are Swinging followed on Epitaph in 1999, but was released only in Europe. During this time the group toured with, Down by Law, All, and played with several bands like Bad Religion, Pennywise, No Fun At All, Blink 182, Dog Eat Dog, Shelter and the Bouncing Souls. In 2002, the group left Epitaph and released five songs on a split with MadBones on Ammonia Records which was intended as a demo only, but the label liked the five songs enough to officially release them and send the band on tour in Italy, Germany and Belgium. Finally they released a self-titled LP in 2005 on Moondown Records, mixed once again by Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore. In November 2008, the band announced that they are calling it quits because \\"time has come to pursue other things\\". They reformed in 2017.

Its appearance is similar to that of the crevalle jack, although the horse-eye jack's head is not as blunt. The horse-eye jack is known to feed on smaller fish and on many invertebrates, such as shrimp and crab. Taxonomy and phylogeny The horse- eye jack is classified within the genus Caranx, one of a number of groups known as the jacks or trevallies. Caranx itself is part of the larger jack and horse mackerel family Carangidae, which in turn is part of the order Carangiformes. The horse-eye jack was first scientifically described in 1831 by the Swiss naturalist Louis Agassiz based on a specimen collected from the waters of Brazil. Agassiz published this description, along with a further three carangids, in a volume co-authored with the German biologist Johann Baptist von Spix entitled Selecta Genera et Species Piscium Brasiliensium. The specific epithet latus is Latin for 'broad', and may also refer to the flank of an animal. The new species was placed in the genus Caranx, with one subsequent revision reassigning the species to Xurel, now considered to be a junior synonym of Carangoides. In the same volume that C. latus was described, Agassiz also described Caranx lepturus, which later examination revealed to be synonymous with C. latus. Due to C. latus being described first in the publication, this name takes priority and relegates C. lepturus to junior synonymy. The species has been redescribed and named a further three times, all of which are similarly considered to be junior synonyms. The horse-eye jack is similar in appearance to the bigeye trevally (Caranx sexfasciatus) of the Indo-Pacific region, causing the American ichthyologist John Nichols to describe C latus as a 'form' of C. sexfasciatus. This analysis is no longer accepted, with the two species considered separate. The horse-eye jack was included in a wide-ranging study of the molecular systematics of the Carangidae. In various analyses and models, C. latus always reliably placed in Caranx, being basal to a clade consisting of C. vinctus and C. caninus. The species is commonly known as the horse-eye jack or horse-eye crevalle in reference to the large eyes of the species. Other lesser used names include big-eye jack and false jack. Description Horse-eyed Jacks in Belize The horse-eye jack is a large fish; it can grow to a maximum recorded length of 101 cm and a weight of 13.4 kg but is more common at lengths less than 60 cm. The horse-eye jack has a body form similar to other large jacks found throughout its range, with a moderately compressed elongate and deep body. The dorsal profile becomes more strongly curved anteriorly, however the forehead is less blunt than the crevalle jack. The eyes are large in proportion to the rest of the head and covered by a well-developed adipose eyelid, with the posterior extremity of the jaw vertically under or past the posterior margin of the eye. The dorsal fin is in two parts, the first consisting of eight spines and the second of one spine followed by 19 to 22 soft rays. The anal fin consists of two anteriorly detached spines followed by one spine and 16 to 18 soft rays. The lobes of the soft dorsal and anal fins are elongated, and the pectoral fin is falcate and longer than the length of the head. The lateral line has a pronounced and moderately long anterior arch. The straight section contains 32 to 39 very strong scutes, with bilateral keels present on the caudal peduncle. The chest is completely scaled. The upper jaw contains a series of strong outer canines with an inner band of smaller teeth, while the lower jaw contains a single row of teeth. The species has 22 to 25 gill rakers in total and 24 vertebrae are present. Like the crevalle jack, the horse-eye jack is known to develop hyperostosis in parts of its skeletal structure. Adult horse-eye jack are typically dark blue to silvery-blue above, becoming silvery white to golden below. In some individuals the tip of the soft dorsal fin lobe and the scutes may be dark blue to black. The caudal fin is yellow to dusky in color. Unlike the crevalle jack, there is no dark spot at the base of the pectoral fin, although but there may be dark spots on the gill covers. Juveniles exhibit a series of about five dark vertical bars on their flanks which fade with age. Distribution Horse-eye Jacks with diver The horse-eye jack is commonly found in the subtropical Atlantic ocean from Bermuda and the northern Gulf of Mexico and south to Rio de Janeiro. In the eastern Atlantic, it is found from St. Paul's Rocks to Ascension Island and, rarely, in the Gulf of Guinea. It is a pelagic fish. It can be found on reefs and offshore oil rigs. The juvenile can be found closer to shore along sandy and muddy bottoms. The species may venture into brackish waters and can live in river mouths, but it is typically found in saltwater up to 140 m in depth. The adult horse-eye jack commonly swims with others in a school, either as one species or mixed with crevalle jack. Sometimes it also swims as a pair with a member of a very different species, such as Halichoeres radiatus, a type of wrasse. Interaction with humans Man with a catch of Horse-Eye Jack and sea catfish The fish is generally wary of scuba divers; it will move slowly away as divers approach. However, schools have been known to crowd around divers, apparently attracted to the bubbles the diver exhales. Throughout its range, the Horse- eye jack is a popular game fish and food fish and consequently is the target of both commercial and recreational fisheries. The current IGFA All Tackle World Record for this species is 32lbs (14.51kg), caught by Terry Lee Ramsey in the Gulf of Mexico off Texas, USA. Previous world records came from Ascension Island, UK; Miami, Florida, USA; Cancun, Mexico, Miami Beach, Florida, USA; and Plantagenet Bank, Bermuda. They are commonly used as bait for larger species of game fish including Atlantic Sailfish, Blue Marlin, Tarpon, and Snook. Horse-eye jack have been identified as a significant carrier of the ciguatera virus and so should be consumed with caution, if at all. References *Horse-eye Jacks, Caranx latus.

The company's abrupt 1957 demise caused a huge shakeup in the publishing industry, forcing many magazine, comic book, and paperback publishers out of business. Early years The American News Company had its roots in two New York City newspaper and periodical wholesaling firms: Sinclair Tousey's company on Nassau St., and the firm Dexter, Hamilton & Co. at 22 Ann St. These were the two largest news and periodical wholesalers in New York City at the time of their merger on Feb. 1, 1864, when American News Company was formed. The seven original partners were Sinclair Tousey, John E. Tousey, Harry Dexter, George Dexter, John Hamilton, Patrick Farrelly, and Solomon W. Johnson. These partners formed the core of the company's management until the death of the last surviving partner, Solomon Johnson, in 1913.\\"Solomon Johnson Dead,\\" The American Stationer, Jan. 25, 1913, p. 32. Sinclair Tousey was the company's first president, followed after his death by Harry Dexter, who was succeeded by Solomon Johnson. The company's Boston branch was formed by taking over the wholesale periodical business of Boston bookseller Alexander Williams. In 1854, Williams had bought out the business of Fetridge & Co., which operated on the corner of State St. and Washington a large magazine store known as the Periodical Depot or the Periodical Arcade. Williams worked up an extensive trade as a jobber of newspapers and periodicals to out of town dealers all over the East Coast, and by the time ANC was organized the wholesale side of the business had grown too large for Williams to handle alone. Along with two smaller competing firms, Dyer & Co. and Federhen & Co.,\\"Boston Notes\\", New England Stationer and Printer, January 1900, p. 6. the Boston trade was reorganized as a subsidiary of American News under the name New England News Company, with Williams as one of the principal shareholders. Initially an officer of the new corporation, Williams was a bookstore proprietor at heart and left soon afterward in 1869 to take over the famous \\"Old Corner Bookstore\\". Two years after the company formed it added to its newspaper and magazine business a book jobbing department, under the supervision of a Mr. Dunham; this grew to be one of the largest in the country. With the end of the Civil War, the firm grew rapidly along the expanding railroads as they opened up the West, with the commencement of coast-to-coast continental rail service in 1869. Legislation passed by Congress required the railroads to transport newspapers and periodicals as second class bulk mail at a special low subsidized rate—one cent per pound for any distance between news agencies, so that a bundle of New York newspapers could be sent across the continent to Los Angeles for the same price that it could be shipped across the river to Newark—and ANC exploited the availability of cheap rail transport to expand their distribution network across the continent, so far ahead of the competition that they effectively shut any possible rivals out of the market, establishing their periodical depots by the hundreds in every city and large town on the rail system. At the same time, the number of periodicals being published in America was exploding: Frank Mott, in A History of American Magazines, estimates that the number of titles being published boomed from 700 at the end of the Civil War to 3300 in 1885. In 1893, an article in The American Newsman summed up the company's success: \\"It is as the keeper of a thousand secrets involving the fortunes of publishers and authors that the American News Company surrounds its vast and intricate system with an atmosphere of mystery, so that few persons have any idea of its really astounding proportions. It has gradually absorbed the smaller organizations until it now embraces thirty-two powerful news companies, with an annual operating expense of $2,488,000 and an annual business of something like $18,000,000. This organization handles the bulk of the reading matter of the United States and supplies nearly nineteen thousand dealers.\\"\\"The American News Company Up to Date,\\" The American Newsman, vol. 10, no. 11 (November 1893), p. 4-5. Unsigned article reprinted from The New York Herald, October 1, 1893, 3rd section, p. 6 (as \\"A Vast System of Distribution\\"). On any given day, a hundred new issues of the thousands of titles ANC handled would typically be fed into the ANC distribution system. In New York City alone (at that time consisting solely of Manhattan and the Bronx) 125 wagons and drivers crisscrossed the city every day making deliveries, with 14 local neighborhood substations. ANC employed directly in 1893 1,154 people, with a weekly payroll of $16,255; with $1 million in real estate holdings and $1.4 million in merchandise on hand. It extended extensive credit to the firms it did business with and $800,000 was due at any given time in accounts receivable from dealers around the country. It owned outright 18 buildings around the country and rented 39 more, and had $200,000 invested in horses and wagons. The branches of the company at this time were located in Albany, Baltimore, Boston, Brooklyn, Buffalo, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Denver, Detroit, Kansas City, Montreal, Newark, New Orleans, Omaha, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Providence, San Francisco, Springfield (Mass.), St. Louis, St. Paul, Toronto, Troy, and Washington D.C. These branches were organized as subsidiaries under different names, for example the Chicago branch was the Great Western News Company, founded in 1866. The International News Company, on Duane Street in New York, was the branch handling the company's extensive overseas business. A branch called the Union News Company existed solely to sell newspapers and magazines on the railroads, with 300 newsstands in railroad stations which by 1893 covered 40% of the entire US railroad system, paying $1000 a day for exclusive rights. Under this system, Union News could keep the Chicago Tribune out of the Chicago area train stations until the Tribune agreed to their terms. In 1958, the FTC found that Union News was operating nearly a thousand newsstands around the country (the next largest operator had 57), putting Union News in a position to dictate terms and demand rebates from publishers. Typically, in the post-Civil War era, ANC in its position as the middleman between publishers and newsstand dealers would allow the newsstand dealers to keep between 5 and 10 cents on the sale of a 35-cent magazine like the monthly Harper's, and three cents on a 10-cent magazine like Harper's Weekly. Unsold copies of most titles were fully returnable, although some titles were sold to the dealers as non-returnable at a steeper discount, similar to today's \\"direct sale\\" comic book market. American News's monopoly position in the market was virtually unchallenged until Frank Munsey, frustrated by ANC's refusal to handle his cheap 10 cent pulp magazines, was forced to set up his own distribution, Red Star News.\\"The Red Star News Company\\", Munsey's Magazine, December 1897, p. 478. This was the first of the so-called ID or independent distributors. Munsey balked when ANC informed him that 4 cents was the most they would pay wholesale for a magazine that sold for 10 cents retail, and Munsey retaliated by cutting out the middleman and setting up his own distributor to sell directly to newsdealers for 7 cents a copy. Munsey was followed in time by Hearst, Fawcett, Curtis, Annenberg and Donenfeld, all constrained by various factors into setting up their own independent distribution networks outside the ANC monopoly; nonetheless ANC remained by far the dominant firm up until its collapse.  Background  American News functioned both as a national distributor and as a local periodical wholesaler. After World War II, headed by Henry Garfinkle, the company had over 300 branches blanketing the United States, and employed several thousand employees. During the middle of the century, American News stood as the largest book wholesaler in the world, dominating the industry. It also had a near stranglehold on the distribution of magazines and newspapers within the United States market, dominating that industry as well. Listed on the New York Stock Exchange, it had more than 5400 stockholders.\\"PERIODICAL DISTRIBS. v. AMERICAN NEWS CO.,\\" UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK (October 15, 1968). Headquartered in New Jersey, American News also had offices in downtown Manhattan.The Park Place buildings were designed by female architect Fay Kellogg. See: \\"New York's Real Lure for Women -- Opportunity,\\" The New York Times (November 12, 1911). Accessed May 7, 2011. Comic book clients of American News included Atlas Comics, Dell Comics, and Toby Press. National Comics had its own distributor, Independent News and was able to take on distribution for other comic book publishers after American News failed. Comic book publishers who were not able to come to terms with National's distributors quickly went under, and others were limited in the number of titles they were allowed to distribute under the new arrangements—Atlas (later known as Marvel Comics) was rationed to eight titles a month. The change also affected paperback book publishers like Lion Library, which went out of business when Independent News (which was already distributing rival New American Library) refused to take it on. Avon paperbacks, which had been founded as a subsidiary of ANC in 1941 in the early days of the paperback boom, managed to survive the crash and was taken over by Hearst. Many magazines distributed in the 1940s were in pulp format; by the end of 1955, nearly all had either ceased publication or switched to digest format. This change was largely the work of the refusal of American News and other distributors to carry the pulp magazines since they were no longer profitable. The 1950s boom in science fiction magazine publishing, with 30 new titles being launched, turned overnight into collapse with the failure of ANC. Other pulp fiction genres—western, romance, detective—suffered a similar extinction event. These sections of the magazine field were already in decline and it was simply not worth the effort to rescue already marginal magazine titles.  Demise  In 1952, the government began antitrust litigation against ANC which was destined to drag on until the company's demise. Around 1955 major magazine publishers began disengaging themselves from ANC and making other arrangements for newsstand distribution. When Collier's and Woman's Home Companion, two of their biggest-selling titles, folded in January 1957, it came as a serious blow to ANC at a time when the company was already on financially shaky ground. In April Dell Publishing announced that they were pulling out and making other arrangements for their distribution. The mammoth company's abrupt demise in June 1957 has been a source of speculation for decades. One theory is that a speculator became aware that a bookkeeping peculiarity in American News' accounts could allow a large profit from liquidating the company. He acquired control, and proceeded to sell off the assets, ultimately winding the company up. This theory was summarized in a 1960 lawsuit: An alternative (but somewhat similar explanation) for the company's demise has been offered by comic book historian and author Gerard Jones. The company in 1956...  Repercussions  The effect on the American magazine market was catastrophic. Many magazines had to switch to one of the independent distributors, who were able to set their own conditions for taking on new business. This often forced the magazines to change from a digest size to a larger format, and to become monthly rather than bimonthly or quarterly. Many magazines could not afford to make these changes, both of which required either high circulation or a strong advertising base, and many magazines folded as a result. An example of a company that the change in distributor had a drastic impact on is Atlas Comics, which was forced to switch distribution to Independent News, owned by National Comics Publications, owner of Atlas' rival, DC Comics. Because of this, Atlas was constrained as to its publishing output for the next decade (including the early years of its successor, Marvel Comics).\\"Stan the Man & Roy the Boy: A Conversation Between Stan Lee and Roy Thomas,\\" Comic Book Artist (2).

WBSC was last owned and operated by D-Mitch Broadcasting, Inc. The station, established in June 1947, fell silent in October 2011 and had its broadcast license revoked by the Federal Communications Commission in November 2012. Coverage area The station broadcast from a transmitter site north of Bennettsville, South Carolina and served Marlboro and Chesterfield County in South Carolina, and Richmond and Scotland County in North Carolina, including the cities of Bennettsville, South Carolina, Laurinburg, North Carolina, and Rockingham, North Carolina. The station ran 10,000 watts during the day from a 1 tower omni-directional array, and 5,000 watts at night from a 5 tower array with a directional pattern to the southeast.WBSC-AM 1550 kHz radio-locator.

Initially, WBSC broadcast on 1400 AM, but changed to 1550 AM sometime between 1951 and 1952. =Changing hands= In 1949, Loys Marsden Hawley sold WBSC to Bennettsville Broadcasting Company for an unknown sum. In 1956, WBSC was again sold, this time to the Atlantic Coast Life Insurance Company. WBSC would change hands again on September 23, 1962, this time being sold to Big Bend Broadcasting. At the time of the sale, WBSC was carrying a Country format. By 1970, WBSC was airing a mix of Gospel and country music, along with the normal fare from the Mutual Broadcasting System. In 1973, the station dropped its Gospel and Country format for a contemporary one (what today would be considered Oldies). By 1980, the station was airing a variety format, with contemporary, Gospel, and country music being heard. The station would revert to a Gospel and country format in 1984. In 1990, WBSC would change formats again, this time to oldies and would drop Mutual Broadcasting System for the Satellite Music Network, the predecessor of the ABC Radio Network. In April 1995, Big Bend Broadcasting sold WBSC to D-Mitch Broadcasting, Inc. At the time of the sale, WBSC was still airing an Oldies format. In 1997, the new owners, D-Mitch Broadcasting, tweaked the station's format, adding Gospel music along with the oldies. Fines and Lawsuit On June 27, 2008, the station was fined $12,000 for \\"failure to maintain operational Emergency Alert System (\\"EAS\\") equipment and failure to maintain and make available a complete public inspection file.\\" A lawsuit was filed against D-Mitch Broadcasting, Inc. on March 4, 2010 to collect the $12,000 fine from 2008. On May 12, 2010, D-Mitch Broadcasting, Inc. was ordered by the court, in default, to pay the $12,000 fine, plus $370.00 in court costs. The defendants, D-Mitch Broadcasting, Inc., \\"failed to appear, plead, or otherwise defend as provided in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\\" according to the Default Judgement. =Falling silent= In the station's November 29, 2011, License Renewal Application, the station had been off the air \\"due [to] lack of funds\\" since October 6, 2011. It was also noted that the station's Emergency Alert System equipment was not working, but was to be replaced, while the public inspection file was updated. In January 2012, the station's former engineer told the Huffington Post that he was let go when the station \\"went under\\" in October 2011. On May 9, 2012, D-Mitch Broadcasting, Inc. was notified that they had neglected to file a \\"Special Temporary Authority\\" application declaring WBSC silent under FCC rules. D-Mitch Broadcasting, Inc. was given \\"until 12:01 a.m., on October 7, 2012\\" to return to the air or their license would \\"automatically expire as a matter of law\\". On November 29, 2012, the FCC had not received a reply to their May 9 letter to D-Mitch Broadcasting, Inc. and \\"based on the lack of a response to [the FCC's] status inquiry letter\\" the FCC declared that WBSC had been off the air for more than 12 months. Under the terms of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as a matter of law a radio station's broadcast license is subject to automatic forfeiture and cancellation if they fail to broadcast for one full year. The FCC cancelled WBSC's license and deleted the WBSC call sign from the database. Additionally, the station's November 29, 2011, License Renewal Application was dismissed. The November 29, 2012, letter was sent back to the FCC on January 22, 2013, with a \\"Return to Sender\\" label on the original envelope. In other media In October 2008, WBSC was a focus of the South Carolina Educational Television documentary Losing Their Voices about the plight of local radio stations in an era of automation and group ownership.

At age eight he was enrolled as a boarder in Modern School, New Delhi; he would later write about homosexual encounters in the school dormitories. He next attended St. Edward's School, Shimla. He began his Intermediate Studies at Maharaja's College, Jaipur in 1953 after which his family sent him to Ahmedabad, Gujarat, where Kakar lived with his aunt, Kamla Chowdhury, and attended engineering college. After his B.E. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Gujarat University 1958, Kakar obtained a master's equivalent in business administration (Dipl.-Kfm.) at the University of Mannheim (1960-64), and a Doctor's degree in Economics at the University of Vienna.

Kakar now resides in Goa and is married to Katharina, a writer and a scholar of comparative religions. Career After returning to India in 1975, Sudhir Kakar set up a practice as a psychoanalyst in Delhi where he was also the Head of Department of Humanities and Social Sciences at Indian Institute of Technology. He has been 40th Anniversary Senior Fellow at the Centre for Study of World Religions at Harvard (2001–02), a visiting professor at the universities of Chicago (1989–93), McGill (1976–77), Melbourne (1981), Hawaii (1998) and Vienna (1974–75), INSEAD, France (1994-2013).

Kakar was in private psychoanalytic practice in New Delhi for 25 years before moving to his current place of residence in Goa, India. Psychoanalysis and mysticism A portion of Sudhir Kakar's work involves the relationship between psychoanalysis and mysticism. His analyses of personages include that of Swami Vivekananda in The Inner World (1978), Mohandas Gandhi in Intimate Relations (1989), and Ramakrishna in The Analyst and the Mystic (1991).In The Indian Psyche, 125–188. 1996 New Delhi: Viking by Penguin. Reprint of 1991 book. Kakar’s novel Ecstasy (2003) was \\"written exclusively for the senses of the skeptic and the mind of the mystic\\" and \\"is the beginning of a journey through the soulscape of spiritual India\\". The story is set in Rajasthan of 1940s or 1960s Psychoanalyst Alan Roland (2009) writes that when Kakar applies his psychoanalytic understanding to these \\"three spiritual figures [Swami Vivekananda, Gandhi, Ramakrishna]\\", his analyses are as \\"fully reductionistic as those of Jeffrey Masson\\". Roland also disputes the Kakar's theoretical understanding of mysticism from a psychoanalytic standpoint, and writes that it is \\"highly questionable whether spiritual aspirations, practices, and experiences essentially involve regression.\\" At a personal level, Kakar feels that spirituality for him consists of moments of profound connection with a person, nature, art, music, and for those who believe in God, with the Divine. His spiritual beliefs have been influenced by a combination of a rationalistic, agonistic father and a religious, ritualistic mother. Awards and honors Kakar's was awarded the 1987 Boyer Prize for Psychological Anthropology of the American Anthropological Association.

This is a five-point scale where the wines are assessed blind (i.e., the tasters don't know the identity of the wine in the glass) by a panel and given points in the three categories bouquet (\\"nose\\"), taste and harmony. The category \\"harmony\\" refers to all sensory impressions, including color, and is concerned with the overall balance between sweetness, acidity, alcohol and \\"body\\"/mouthfeel of the wine. Each category is assessed on the scale 0-5 (fractional points may be awarded), and the points given are then averaged, with the same weight given to the three categories. For a wine to be given its quality control test number (A.P. Number for Amtliche Prüfung) necessary to display a Prädikat designation of the German wine classification, a minimum of 1.5 out of 5 is necessary in all three categories, otherwise the wine is denied a classification.German Wine Institute: Quality control testing, read on January 1, 2008 References External links * German Agricultural Society (DLG) * Category:Agriculture in Germany Category:German wine Category:Wine industry organizations Category:1885 establishments in Germany Category:Organizations established in 1885 ","title":"German Agricultural Society"},{"id":"14986876","text":"WULR (980 AM) is an American radio station licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to serve the community of York, South Carolina, United States.

WBZK was exchanged for station WPYR in Louisiana with no money changing hands, according to the agreement filed with the FCC. At the same time, the station's call sign was changed to WULR. Before its switch to Christian talk, WBZK's programming consisted largely of contemporary Christian music. The music was programmed on an automated basis rather than having live-on air personalities. WBZK had relatively few interruptions between songs for commercials or other non-musical items. Songs were often played back-to-back with no bumpers in between.

The segment of its main line from Detroit to Lansing became an important component of the Pere Marquette Railroad, organized in 1900, and is still in use by CSX.  History  = Corporate = The Detroit, Lansing and Lake Michigan (DL&LM;) was incorporated April 11, 1871, as a consolidation of the Detroit, Howell and Lansing Railroad and the Ionia and Lansing Railroad. In 1872, the Ionia, Stanton and Northern Rail Road was added. By 1876 the railroad was obliged for more than $6 million in mortgages at 8%, much of it owed to men sitting on the Board of Directors, and had an operating deficit of more than $1.8 million, much of it representing unpaid interest.Fifth Annual Report of the Commissioner of Railroads for the State of Michigan, 1877 DL&LM;'s lenders foreclosed in April 1876. George O. Shauttuck and J. Lewis Stackpole of Boston--acting as trustees for the lenders --purchased the railroad for $60,000 at a mortgage sale in Detroit on December 14, 1876. A new corporation was organized on December 27, 1876 under the name Detroit, Lansing and Northern Railroad, with most of its stock going to the lenders in exchange for their forgiving the DL&LM;'s debts. The only Michigan resident among the eleven directors named to the first board was James Joy, formerly president of the BL&LM.; Declared business objectives of the DL&N; were: * to extend the mainline to Pentwater, on Lake Michigan * to extend the Stanton line to join the Flint and Pere Marquette Railroad at Chippewa * to pay a 7% annual dividend on its preferred stock.Articles of Incorporation, Detroit, Lansing and Northern Railroad, December 27, 1876 In 1882, the principal officers were Alpheus Hardy, president; Thomas Fish, general superintendent; and J.J. McVean, engineer. The DL&N; had over 1000 employees in Michigan, but none of its 438 stockholders or eleven directors were Michigan residents. Though profitable, the railroad had taken on debts equivalent to $15,897 for every mile of track over which it operated. Eleventh Annual Report of the Commissioner of Railroads for the State of Michigan, 1883 The railroad withstood the Panic of 1893, and as late as 1895 was still profitable, with an expense-to-earnings ratio of 81.78. The principal mortgage of $2.67 million at 7% was payable in 1907. Total debt per mile owned and operated (221.57) had climbed to $19,158. President of the railroad as 1896 began was Nathaniel Thayer, general superintendent was J.K.V. Agnew, and chief engineer was J.J. McVean.23rd Annual Report of the Commissioner of Railroads for the State of Michigan, 1895, pg 132 The DL&N; went into receivership on April 1, 1896, and was reorganized as the Detroit, Grand Rapids and Western Railroad on January 1, 1897. The DGR&W; also consolidated the Grand Rapids, Lansing & Detroit, Saginaw Valley & St. Louis, Saginaw & Grand Rapids, and the Saginaw & Western. On December 7, 1899, it became part of the new Pere Marquette Railway.Meints (1992), 64-65. = Operational = DL&N; route map from Gailbraith Service Map, 1897 At its inception in December 1876, the DL&N; inherited of track, more than of wooden bridges and trestles, 26 locomotives, and more than 750 railcars of all types. In 1876, its predecessor had carried more than 250,000 passengers and of freight. The tracks over which they ran had become operational as follows: Main Line () * Detroit to Lansing, August 1871 * Lansing to Ionia, December 1869 * Ionia to Greenville, September 1870 * Greenville to Howard City, August 1871 Branch Line () * Ionia to Stanton, February 1873Fifth Annual Report of the Commissioner of Railroads for the State of Michigan, 1877 At Howard City, the main line connected to the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad (GR&I;). The DL&N; extended the Stanton branch to McBride in 1877 and the next year to Blanchard. In July 1880 the branch was completed to Big Rapids, Michigan, where the DL&N; made a second connection to the GR&I.; In 1882, the DL&N; acquired a lease in perpetuity to the assets of the Saginaw & Western Railroad, which had gone into receivership under the name Chicago, Saginaw and Canada Railroad. By this time, DL&N; trains were logging more than a year over of track, carrying more than 635,000 passengers and of freight. Eleventh Annual Report of the Commissioner of Railroads for the State of Michigan, 1883 The railroad reported (operating miles) in 1886, with the most significant addition being the Saginaw & Western's branch from Howard City to Alma, which provided an interchange with the Toledo, Ann Arbor and North Michigan Railroad. The freight traffic was overwhelmingly (62%) lumber and forest products, as the logging off of Michigan's old-growth forest continued to accelerate thanks to mechanization. A conversion to automatic couplers, mandated by an 1885 state law, was underway, and Westinghouse air brakes had appeared.Fifteenth Annual Report of the Commissioner of Railroads for the State of Michigan, 1887 In August, 1888, two new rail segments built by the Grand Rapids, Lansing and Detroit Railroad and immediately leased by the DL&N; went into service. The first was a line from Grand Ledge to Grand Rapids. The second was the Ramona Branch, a short extension from Oakdale Park Station to Reeds Lake, later East Grand Rapids, Michigan to serve the resorts there. In the railroad's last full year of operation, it carried nearly 643,000 passengers, with the average trip . Freight traffic had fallen to , with 36% of it lumber and forest products, and another 13% coal.

The teacher says another lady in the room can tell her more about him. Marjorie explains Valentine was her uncle. One day, her Aunt Charlotte is getting ready for her brother to come back after leaving for Europe subsequent to leaving his wife. She trains the girls to sing for Valentine's arrival. When he first gets there, they have a welcome party at their neighbour's, Bonnie Brae. Later, Valentine explains he left his wife whilst on holiday in Europe because she was only concerned about saving money and did not seem to enjoy life for what it is. A few days later, he goes Christmas shopping with his sister Charlotte. On Christmas Eve, Charlotte throws a party with some neighbours, and Valentine decides to leave the room and play music, where he is joined by Marjorie and eventually Charlotte too. The following winter and spring Valentine is busy writing new songs and playing and teaching music to the girls. They also take walks in the surrounding valleys. Later, he goes into town for a while, and comes back to say Louise Ireland is leaving Paris and going to travel round the world whilst he wants to stay with them.

His largest work was a mural for the Manor House at Port Lympne Zoo. Early life Roberts' father, Arthur Meyrick Roberts, was an army officer serving in World War I and later Ireland, where he married and Spencer was born in Cork. He rose to bandmaster in the Kings own Yorkshire Light Infantry, but eventually left the army and became a trombone player for the Scottish Orchestra in Glasgow (1923–27). The family moved to Hastings on medical advice that a southern climate would improve Arthur's tuberculosis. Swimming was advised to help his condition, following the example of Johnny Weissmuller, who has also suffered from tuberculosis. Arthur became a proficient swimmer to the point of being selected for the 1939 Olympic team for 100 m freestyle, but the onset of war caused the event to be cancelled. He had a youthful interest in wildlife and bird watching and became an expert beach fisherman. He was educated at Hastings Grammar School from 1931 to 1937. He then attended Hastings College of Art, run by Philip Cole and Percy Badham. Cole objected to the use of erasers, and Roberts retained the habit of never using one throughout his career. Badham was an able watercolourist, and this also influenced Roberts in his preference for using watercolours and gouache. Roberts won a scholarship to attend the Royal College of Art, but this was also prevented by the outbreak of war. Military career Roberts joined the 114th Field Regiment of the Territorial Army in 1938, on the advice of his father that war was inevitable, against the wishes of his mother. In 1939, the unit trained with guns taken from Hastings Museum, but shortly received modern equipment. Roberts volunteered to become an airforce pilot and was trained initially at Scarborough Initial Training Wing, then Perth Elementary Flying School, using Tiger Moth and Miles Magister aircraft. He was part of the first group to be sent to the USA for fighter training under the Empire Air Training Plan, training with Airacobras, Lockheed Lightnings, Tomahawks and Kittyhawks at Lakeland, Florida. In 1942 Roberts crashed a tomahawk, initially surviving uninjured, but receiving a severe head injury when he was dropped out of the wreck during rescue. He was sent to Canada where he received further training as a bomb aimer and navigator before becoming a navigation instructor with rank of flight lieutenant in the Royal Canadian Air force at Trenton, Ontario, when he was pronounced permanently unfit to fly. In 1943 he was recalled to the army in England, and sent temporarily to Watford. He was chosen amongst other soldiers to take part in the film The Way Ahead directed by Carol Reed. After the war, Reed offered Roberts more acting work, which he declined. He was posted to India, underwent jungle training at Deolali before serving temporarily at various places in India and Pakistan, with rank of Gunner. He requested transfer to Burma where he served as a sergeant in 1944 at the Arakan Front, where he was employed to scout and make drawings of enemy positions. He received a bullet wound to his right hand, which became close to requiring amputation. After hostilities ceased and while the army stayed in India, he produced a number of murals in various buildings (hospitals and the palace of the Maharajah of Mysore). In 1946 he was demobilised having won six campaign medals. In later life he painted scenes of guns used in the Gulf War, the Arakan campaign and scenes from the Battle of the Somme where both his and his wife's father had served. Later life In 1946, he was demobbed and returned to Sussex. There he met his wife Mavis and was married in 1946 at St Mary Magdalen Church in Hastings. From 1946-1948 he completed his Fine Arts degree, before attending Brighton Arts College in 1949 to obtain a teaching diploma. He began teaching at Maidstone Secondary Modern school for one year, before obtaining a post at Hastings Central School. In 1955 he illustrated a book about Canada, 'Smoke over Sikanska by J.S. Gowland. This encouraged him to move to British Columbia in Canada. He first took a post to teach art history at Vancouver university, but then found work as a commercial artist for the Hudson's Bay Company in Vancouver where he prepared advertising illustrations of items ranging from Lingerie to artworks. In 1957 he was recalled to England by the British army because of the Suez Crisis, but this was over before he returned to military life. He spent a year preparing work for an exhibition and completed paintings from sketches made in Canada. These paintings began to sell, but he took a teaching job at the Downs school, Bexhill. The couple initially lived in St Leonards-on-Sea, but purchased a house on a cliff top at Fairlight where they remained for five years. In 1965 Roberts decided to sell the house, purchase a caravan, and move to the Isle of Arran in Scotland. Privations of life in the wilderness and a desire for company eventually led to another return to Sussex and the purchase of a house in Rye, together with a return to part-time teaching. The availability for purchase of a dilapidated coastguard cottage allowed both a return to beachside living at Fairlight and an opportunity to pay off the mortgage, allowing Roberts to work full-time as an artist. Interest in his works increased, with exhibitions in London and an increasing number of visitors to his home. Further exhibitions followed at the Armand Hammer galleries in New York City. After returning from one such visit, the couple discovered that their home had moved dramatically closer to the cliff edge following ongoing rock slides. They decided to move again, this time to a former boathouse once used to plan the construction of the Royal Military Canal. Exhibitions of his paintings in America were successful and were followed by others in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Japan.

Biography He studied medicine at the University of Copenhagen, and in the early 1970s began to collect research data on public health and nutrition for the Danish government. This led to writing a medical column for the daily newspaper Politiken and serving as nutrition advisor for the Danish bread manufacturer Schulstad, an assignment which resulted in bread with more fibre. He also produced a government-sponsored, educational TV- series, Sund og slank (healthy and slim) in 1974, accompanied by a book of the same name, which sold 750.000 copies, his first huge publishing success. Later followed many more booksBooks in Danish, including several best-sellers, and a health magazine, Lev vel (live well) (1977). In 1976, Hessel developed a trimness-pill called Fiber Trim, followed ten years later by his diet-pill Gastrolette, later marketed as Minus Calories and Zotrim. In 1975, Hessel started The Family Doctor, a newspaper cartoon inspired by his experiences as a GP. The series was syndicated by The New York Times to newspapers and magazines in 42 countries. It reached a daily readership in excess of 320 million, ran for 14 years and made Lasse Hessel internationally famous. Hessel's best known invention is probably the Femidom, also called the female condom. He developed it after hearing about the lack of options available for women trying to avoid HIV/AIDS. It launched in Europe in 1990 and was approved by the FDA for sale in the United States in 1993. Today, its production is sponsored by World Health Organization and the United Nations. In 2000, the success of the Femidom was recognized with the Queen's Awards for Enterprise in the international trade category. In 1991, Hessel published a bestselling book and videotape called Window on Love, based on his research with ultrasound-scans, which he used to study how the penis moves inside the woman's pelvis during sexual intercourse. The book demonstrates how the penis can stimulate various sensitive areas of the vagina, leading to a more satisfying sexlife. It was published in several languages and was followed by a whole series of health books on sexually related subjects such as safe sex, sensual massage, etc. Another invention, the Femi-X pill, is a sort of Viagra for women suffering from sexual dysfunction. It was developed in cooperation with King's College and launched worldwide in 2004. Based on a mixture of herbal ingredients, the Femi-X pill allegedly enhances the female libido by stimulating the blood flow and natural brain activity. It was accompanied by an educational DVD, Femi-X and Beyond (2004), hosted by Danish sexologist Joan Ørting. Other systems invented by Hessel include the Aqua Wall (1978), an indoor waterfall designed to improve the environmental condition; a remover of insect poison; a remover of pimples; Cellastic (1986), a protective material based on human cell structure; the Bio Tap, a titanium ring system for secure attachment of stoma bags; the DiaTest saliva collection kit; and the DiaQuick, a diagnostic system for early detection of breast cancer. Towards the end of his life, Hessel ran his own research company, Medic House, based in Denmark, and was co-owner of Natures Remedies, a company in London, while living with his wife and four children in the small Danish harbour town Svendborg.

(c. 1490–1523) was a Frisian military commander, warlord and member of the Arumer Zwarte Hoop (\\"Arumer Black Heap\\"). He was the lieutenant of Pier Gerlofs Donia (also known as Grutte Pier) and fought along his side against the Saxon and Hollandic invaders. Jelckama took Donia's place as freedom fighter after Donia died in 1520. Early life and family Jelckama was born in the year 1490 in a large family of farmers and petty noblemen. He was descended from knights who had participated in the Crusades. One of his ancestors from his father's side of the family had died at the Siege of Antioch.J.J. Kalma. Grote Pier Van Kimswerd (1970), p. 51. . Rebellion Together with Pier Gerlofs Donia, Jelckama fought against the Saxon warriors that occupied their homeland of Frisia, at the capture of Medemblik, and in the siege of Middelburg castle. In addition to the area occupied by the Saxons, parts of Frisia were conquered by Denmark, Holland, and local duchies. Donia and Jelckama's goal was to rid Frisia of all foreign powers and regain independence. Under the leadership of Donia, they used guerilla tactics and gained several victories, including the successful siege of two Hollandic castles and the city of Medemblik. Their greatest success, however, came at sea, where Donia and Jelckama sank 28 Dutch ships, earning Donia the title \\"Cross of the Dutchmen\\".Beekman, Martinus.

The rebels received financial support from Charles of Egmond, who claimed the Duchy of Guelders in opposition to the Habsburgs. Charles also used mercenaries under Maarten van Rossum in his support. However, when the tides turned against the rebels after 1520, Charles withdrew his support, and the rebels could no longer afford to pay their mercenary army. Around the same time, Arumer Zwarte Hoop also lost their leader. In 1519, Donia's health grew worse. He retired to his farm where he died in 1520. He was buried in Sneek in the 15th-century Groote Kerk (also called the Martinikerk).Geldersche Volks- Almanak Published 1853 Jelckama took over the command of the armies, then made up of over 4,000 soldiers. Jelckama also gained some minor victories, but proved to be a less competent commander and slowly lost men. Jelckama and his soldiers took part in acts of piracy and sacked many villages in the Frisian lands, losing the trust and support of their own people. The fact that Jelckama was less personable than Donia also cost him: he forged less fruitful alliances and lost more than he made. All this would lead to the defeat of Jelckama and his army. Death After a series of defeats, he and what was left of the Frisian army were captured in 1523 and taken to the city of Leeuwarden in Frisia. There they were publicly beheaded. With the death of Jelckama and the rebels, the rebellion of Frisia came to an end. It was the last revolt in Frisian history and is remembered as such to this day.

Ma'agan Michael is among Israel's largest and wealthiest kibbutzim.This Plastic-fueled Kibbutz Is Thriving, but Can It Stay That Way?, Haaretz Geography Nahal Taninim The kibbutz is located 30 km south of Haifa and 70 km north of Tel Aviv and lies near the edge of the Mediterranean Sea west of Mount Carmel, south of bordering kibbutz Ma'ayan Zvi, and north of the Taninim Stream. It is north of an Arab village, Jisr az-Zarqa. The original site was a windswept, treeless sandstone (Eolianite) hill. Some of this land was reclaimed from Kabarra swamp. The nearby Timsah Springs, which originates from the Taninim Stream, is one of the local sources of brackish water for the kibbutz' numerous fishponds, which total 1,600 dunams (1.6 km²) in surface area. The Nahal Taninim nature reserve lies south of the kibbutz and is the site of an ancient Roman dam and aqueduct, which have been restored by the Department of Antiquities, the Drainage Authorities, and Nature and Parks Authorities. History Ma'agan Michael was founded on 25 August 1949 by a group consisting of 154 members and 44 children who had joined together in 1942, most of whom were members of the Hebrew Scouts. It was named for Michael Pollack, founder of the Nesher cement plant.The Song of Concrete It is located on the land of the Palestinian village of Kabara, which became depopulated in the 1948 Palestine war. The group was originally based in a temporary Jewish Agency camp in Pardes Hanna, where they learned the skills needed to create an independent settlement, including how to manage citrus groves, cows, sheep, and chickens. The initial group was joined by a larger group of younger immigrants without their parents from Germany and Austria (Youth Aliyah), and were undergoing preparatory training at Ein Gev. The group stayed in Pardess Hanna until the end of World War II, while several members were sent abroad as emissaries; others joined the Jewish Brigade, the Palmach, worked in other kibbutzim, in the Dead Sea Works at Sdom, or in the newly established Military Industries. In 1946 the HQ Staff of the Haganah relocated the group to a temporary settlement in Rehovot, which later was known as “Kibbutz Hill”. This settlement was to serve as cover for a secret underground factory to manufacture 9mm ammunition for Sten submachine guns. During this period the kibbutz members lived a double life to keep information of the illicit arms factory from the British Mandate Forces. In 1948 the factory was moved to the newly founded Military Industries (TAAS). The site at Kibbutz Hill in Rehovot is currently preserved as the Ayalon Museum. The first members began settling the present site, erecting the first buildings which consisted of wooden huts prepared by carpenters in Rehovot. In the early years the kibbutz took in many disadvantaged youngsters and youth groups (youth aliyah). An ulpan was opened, and many ulpan graduates later joined the ranks of the kibbutz membership. The ulpan became popular and successful, and has completed more than 100 5-month- long courses with thousands of graduates. Most of the agricultural land of the kibbutz was reclaimed from the Kabarra swampland, which was drained in the 1920s with money from Baron Rothschild, and labor of Jewish pioneers and local Bedouin residents. A small area remains swamplike and is used as pasture for horses and as a nature reserve. The kibbutz engaged in internal talks regarding the desire for change based on providing the members with a greater choice in their decisions and their budgets, greater privatization, and less dependence on others. They adopted a decision regarding the dining room and increasing options by paying for food. All these changes are being approached slowly and deliberately to try to preserve the kibbutz's communal values. The kibbutz has become the largest kibbutz in Israel with a population of 1,412, consisting of 791 members and candidates for membership, 383 children, plus non-member residents, soldiers, and ulpanists. On 11 March 1978, eleven Palestinian militants landed in Zodiac boats on a beach just outside Ma'agan Michael and from there ventured towards Tel Aviv in a hijacked bus in what has become known as the Coastal Road massacre where 38 Israelis were killed. First, however, the terrorists shot and killed American nature photographer Gail Rubin, who was photographing wildlife on the beach at the kibbutz for a book. Demographics Together with the Israel-born members, the kibbutz membership has a heterogeneity of origins. It has absorbed members with origins from all over the world. Many members came from Arab countries (Iraq, Tunisia, Morocco). Economy Ma'agan Michael's agricultural endeavors includes field crops and orchards. Field crops are grown on 1600 dunams (1.6 km²) of the Kabarra. Fodder is grown for the dairy cows. For many years the main crop has been cotton. Several varieties of avocado (1,000 dunams) are grown, especially in orchards in Tantura, most of which is exported to Europe. The kibbutz produces 1,200 tons of bananas per year, solely for the local market. Papaya and other exotic fruits are grown in 40 dunams in greenhouses (organic crop), with over 80 types of fruit trees (Abraham's Orchard) on Mount Carmel. The kibbutz produces 2,000 tons of poultry per year, using free-range intensive breeding. The chick hatchery produces about 4.5 million day-old chicks per year. There is a dairy herd with about 300 cows and 200 calves, which produces over 3.2 million liters of milk per year. MADAN is the Aquaculture Fish farming branch of kibbutz Ma’agan Michael agriculture enterprises. The aquaculture branches include about 1600 dunams of fishponds, where edible fish such as carp, gray mullet, St. Peter's fish and silver carp are raised. There is also an area for intensive fish production in concrete ponds, which are used to raise almost 300 tons of striped bass, Musar, Lavrak.Profile MADAN The kibbutz sells over 1,000 tons of edible fish per year. The kibbutz also raises seafish, as well as decorative fish for ponds and aquaria, such as Koi and goldfish. Since 1958 Ma'agan Michael has run two ulpans per year. The ulpan is a central part of the identity of Ma'agan Michael. Over 25% of the members of the kibbutz are graduates. Plasson is the kibbutz's plastics factory. It was founded in 1963 and is the main source of income and employment for the kibbutz.Among the Last of the Socialists, Haaretz Annual sales reach about $100 million, with some 85% of the products exported worldwide. The main Plasson factory at Ma'agan Michael employs over 400 workers, half of them members of the kibbutz. About 200 more workers are employed in subsidiaries around the world. Plasson is a leader in polyethylene pipe-fittings, poultry drinker systems, and is a large producer of toilet- flushing systems, mainly for the local market. The company has full ownership of six marketing companies abroad and holds part ownership in several others. Plasson also holds full or part ownership of 6 production companies in Israel and abroad. In 1997, 20% of Plasson was floated as stocks on the Tel Aviv stockmarket. The public company is called Plasson Industries, Inc. In April 2000 a strategic partner, the Swiss company George Fischer, acquired for 20%. Suron is a factory established by the kibbutz to produce precise metal parts using photochemical etching and electroforming, and also metal plating in gold and nickel. The precision metal parts produced by Suron are used in an industrial products and are used in industries involved in electronics, microelectronics, electro-optics, precise mechanics, electronic circuits and medical products. Suron also provides technical photographic service for “high-tech” industries.Suron ACS Ltd Notable residents *Eliezer Rafaeli (1926–2018), founding President of the University of Haifa See also *Ma'agan Michael Ship *Walk on Water (film) References External links *Kibbutz website *Ma'agan Michael Agro Center *Yugoslav refugees head for Israel Jewish News of Greater Phoenix, 16 April 1999 *English team playing football in Ma'agan Michael Category:Kibbutzim Category:Kibbutz Movement Category:Populated places established in 1949 Category:1949 establishments in Israel Category:Archaeological sites in Israel Category:Populated places in Haifa District ","title":"Ma'agan Michael"},{"id":"14987173","text":"Reyssouze is a commune in the Ain department in eastern France.

The single-track, standard gauge railway was an industrial railway operated by the power station owned by Oslo Lysverker and the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate. The line was completed in 1918. It was originally planned to be demolished in 1922, but the passenger trains proved popular and it continued in use until 1965. From 1928 it was served using railcars. The tracks were demolished in 1970 Route The Solbergfoss Line ran from Askim Station to Solbergfoss, entirely located within the municipality of Askim. The Line was long, branching off from the Eastern Østfold Line. The line was standard gauge, but never equipped with a signaling system. The line did not have any stations, only four flag stops in addition to Askim Station.Bjerke & Holom: 287 As the line was planned to be temporary, it received a low standard. The minimum curve radius was and nearly 20 percent of the line has a gradient of 2.5 percent.Aspenberg: 65 The line had rails weighing 30 kg/m (60 lb/ft).Langård & Ruud: 110 The line started at Askim Station. After the line crosses over the Kolstad Bridge. It reached Onstad () and then crossed Skaarud Bridge () before reaching Tømt () and Oppegaard. The terminus was at Solbergfoss (). There was en engine shed there. Little of the line remains. There are some tracks left in the streets of Askim. The first out of Askim have been converted to a pathway, as has the section from Onstad to Tømt and the last to Solbergfoss. The engine shed at Solbergfoss remains.Aspenberg: 68 History Oslo Municipality bought Wittenberg–Halfredfoss in Glomma in 1898. They issued an engineering competition, which concluded with that also Solbergfoss should be part of a hydropower station. Oslo Municipality therefore bought Solbergfoss in 1906. A committee was appointed in 1907 and recommended two years later that Mørkfoss and Solbergfoss be built at the same time. Construction started in 1913. An agreement with the government allowed for a joint construction of the power from 1916. The power station was dimensioned for a production of 115 megawatts and 670 GWh/year.Ljøgodt: 29 Solberg Power Station sometime between 1925 and 1930 To allow for easier construction, Oslo Lysverker decided to build a railway line from Askim to the construction site. It was planned to only be used during the construction period, and was therefore built with a low standard. Construction of the track was carried out in 1913, and the government issued permission for a temporary line on 1 May 1914. The line was fully operational in 1918. During the construction period the railway rented some compartment coaches from the Norwegian State Railways (NSB). A Danish steam locomotive was bought in 1919 and an NSB Class 9 was borrowed in 1920. The latter was needed to overcome the snow during winter. Passenger transport proved popular and when construction of the power station was completed in 1922, there was public demand for operations to continue. Langård & Ruud: 112 Another advantage was that it would allow heavy machinery and other materials to be transported to the power station at a later date. Passenger traffic was limited, and there were never more than two to three daily round trips.Aspenberg: 67 The first railcar was bought in 1928, allowing both the remaining steam locomotives to be chopped in 1930. Freight trains to the power station were thereafter operated using a shunter from SB. A second railcar was bought in 1938. From the 1950s there was increasing car traffic, taking patronage away from the railway. From the late 1950s to 1965 most of the traffic was as a school transport. The last major transport to the power station took place in 1948. As operations had run with a loss for many years, the power station owners decided to terminate operations from 4 January 1965. Initially operations were merely temporarily placed on hood. The tracks were kept and the railcars parked at the depot at Solbergfoss. A few freight trains were run, but this stopped after one derailed. The newly formed Norwegian Railway Club was given the two railcars in 1969. These were driven to Askim and then transported onward to the Krøderen Line. They were renovate and have since become part of the heritage railway operations there. The tracks were demolished in 1970. Rolling stock During the power station construction, the company hired in locomotives. The two most used was St Olof and Bayreuth, the latter which was a Bavarian D IV built in 1883 and delivered to the Royal Bavarian State Railways. When permanent traffic commenced in 1922, the company bought two used locomotives. One was bought from the Lemvig–Thyborøn Line in Denmark in 1918. The second was a used NSB Class 9 which was procured in 1922. The railway bought two railcars for its passenger services, named Gamla and Padda. Both were two-axled and powered with a gasoline prime mover. Gamla was built by Hässleholm and seating for 17 passengers. It was powered by a 49-kW (66-HP) Willys-Knight engine. Padda was bought from NSB and was built by Skabo. It was powered by a 98-kW (133-HP) Hercules engine. It had space for 24 passengers.

Life Yukimori supported the cause of Amago Katsuhisa (1553–1578), including the Siege of Kōzuki Castle. He even tried to get help from the Oda clan. Unfortunately, Oda Nobunaga only used him so the Oda army could march deeper into the Mōri clan's lands. Akechi Mitsuhide and Hashiba Hideyoshi wanted to give him reinforcements, but Nobunaga refused. Therefore, those two generals were forced into concentrating on laying siege to the Mōri and Ukita castles rather than helping Yukimori. Eventually, Yukimori surrendered and his master Katsuhisa committed suicide. Kikkawa Motoharu awarded him with a small castle in Suo.

Origins Born about 1350, he was once thought to be descended from the soldier Sir Robert Knollys but modern sources give his father as Richard. There were obviously close links with Sir Robert, who named Thomas as one of his executors in 1389. Career Before 1387 he had become a member of the Grocers' Company, which he served as warden and as master, contributing to the building of their new hall in Poultry and to the rebuilding of the guild church of St. Antholin in Watling Street, where he lived. In addition to his main business interests in goods and properties, he also became a major financier, lending extensively to other businessmen and to the government. In local government, he was an alderman by 1393, Sheriff of London in 1394 and twice served as Lord Mayor in 1399 and in 1410, in his second term being responsible for rebuilding the Guildhall. In two brief royal appointments, he was collector of customs duties on wool for London in 1400 and joint treasurer of war finances in 1404. In October 1416 he became an MP for the City of London as one of the two aldermanic representatives. In addition to his London properties, in 1391 he bought and later extended a country estate at North Mimms in Hertfordshire. After 1484, upon the death of his grandson Robert without sons, moieties of the property were inherited by Robert's two daughters: Anne who married Henry Frowick, and Elizabeth the wife of James Stracheley. He was buried in St Antholin's beside his wife and his will made on 20 May 1435 was proved on 11 July 1435 at Lambeth.The text of his will, in Latin, is printed in E.F. Jacob (ed.), The Register of Henry Chichele, Archbishop of Canterbury 1414-1443 Canterbury and York Society, no.42 (Wills), (Oxford University Press 1937), pp. 519-26. Family By 1371 he had married Joan (died 1431) who in their sixty years together had nineteen children, of whom four sons and three daughters survived their father. His eldest son Thomas (died 1446), who inherited his businesses and properties, was through his younger son Richard the ancestor of the courtier Sir Francis Knollys.

It was opened sometime in the early 1920s and was closed in 2000. It is the location of the Love-Hatbox Sports Complex, a large recreation center and waterpark. The former airfield site includes 10 lighted baseball fields‚ eight lighted softball diamonds‚ two full-size football fields and a 30 acre‚ 19-field soccer area called the Georgia Pacific Soccer Complex. In addition‚ a 3.1-mile (5 km) asphalt Centennial Trail walking/biking exercise pathway loops around the 120 acres‚ and a former airplane hangar houses three indoor batting cages. Three Rivers Area Model Plane Society (T.R.A.M.P.S.), a local model airplane club, hosts two annual events at Love-Hatbox that attract flying enthusiasts from around the country. History Hatbox Field was depicted on the 1929 Rand McNally \\"Standard Indexed Map with Air Trails of OK\\" as a public airport with a radio station. The airfield was Muskogee's original municipal airport, and is a very historic airfield. It is one of the airports that the Douglas aircraft of the Army's 1924 Around the World Flight stopped, and was a stop on the Army's mail route. In 1929, the airfield was described as a municipal airport, operated by the Army Air Corps, and having a beacon light. Charles Lindbergh was on hand for the dedication. The Spartan Aviation School opened at the field in 1940. They used the two large arch-roofed hangars at Hatbox. Renamed Muskogee Army Airfield during World War II, Spartan provided primary flight training to cadets as an Army Air Forces contract flying school until 1944. The USAAF 410th Bombardment Group trained at the airfield with Douglas A-20 Havocs in the fall of 1943 before being reassigned to the Ninth Air Force in England, where they flew Martin B-26 Marauders. Following the end of its military use, Hatbox was reused as a purely civil airfield. The operator was listed as the City of Muskogee. The city of Muskogee decided to close the field to the public following a two-fatality crash in 1998. Limited aviation use was allowed until 2000, however, by a private firm that refurbished military-surplus Beechcraft U-21 Utes. Hatbox was closed completely in 2000, and the refurbishing company moved to nearby Muskogee Davis Field.  Facilities  Hatbox Field covered an area of at an elevation of 627 feet (191 m) above mean sea level. It had one runway designated 11/29 with an asphalt surface measuring 3,800 by 50 feet (1,158 x 15 m).

Originally published in April 1941 in the magazine Astounding Science Fiction, it was recognized as one of the best science fiction short stories published before the Nebula Awards by the Science Fiction Writers of America in 1970, and was named as one of the best science fiction stories in polls by Analog Science Fiction and Fact (the renamed Astounding) in 1971 and Locus in 1999. In 1976, it was also published as a comic book version (drawn by Adolfo Buylla) in issue 3 of Starstream: Adventures in Science Fiction, a comic anthology in four issues by Gold Key Comics.STARSTREAM #3 Plot summary A highly secretive and reclusive biochemist named Kidder produces inventions that transform human life, spanning every aspect of science and engineering. Kidder is a brilliant scientist, but can only take others' ideas and turn them into usable products - he cannot innovate. Consequently he gets impatient with the slow progress of innovation by humans, and develops a synthetic life form, which he calls \\"Neoterics.\\" These creatures live at a greatly accelerated rate, and therefore have a very short lifespan and produce many generations over a short period of time. Kidder asserts his authority over the Neoterics by killing off half the population of Neoterics whenever they disobey his orders. Kidder communicates with the colony via 'teletype' and this device is considered divine by the Neoterics. Kidder's banker, Conant, who has grown immensely rich on the inventions passed on by Kidder, takes over the island on which Kidder has built his laboratory, hoping to use a Neoteric design for a new source of power to take over the world. When the banker strikes to kill Kidder and the workers who had assisted in building the power plant, Kidder asks the Neoterics to throw up an impenetrable force field. The story ends years later. It is unknown whether or not Kidder is still alive under the shield, but it is certain that the Neoterics have continued to develop technology far in excess of anything controlled by humans.  Awards and criticism  \\"Microcosmic God\\" was among the stories selected in 1970 by the Science Fiction Writers of America as one of the best science fiction short stories published before the creation of the Nebula Awards. As such, it was published in The Science Fiction Hall of Fame Volume One, 1929-1964. The novelette was also recognized as the 13th best all-time short science fiction story in a 1971 Analog Science Fact & Fiction poll (tied with Cyril M. Kornbluth's \\"The Little Black Bag\\"), and as the 42nd best all- time science fiction novelette in a 1999 Locus poll (tied with Edmond Hamilton's \\"What's It Like Out There?\\"). The Neoterics make an illustrative reappearance in the 2008 management book Groundswell, developed by employees at Forrester Research: Neoterics are said to \\"outpace any human research lab since they try, fail, and adapt so much more quickly than ordinary slow-paced humans\\", and are thus presented as \\"apt metaphor for the current state of the Internet\\", where Web 2.0 technologies and the many people involved generate similarly \\"rapid prototyping, failure, and adaptation.\\"Li, Charlene, and Josh Bernoff. Groundswell: Winning in a World Transformed by Social Technologies. Cambridge MA: Harvard Business Press, 2008, pp 11-12. John W. Campbell, the editor who bought the story for Astounding Science Fiction, wrote for its blurb, \\"Kidder had a system for inventing things in a hurry - and he thought he had a system for handling the results. His method was inhuman - but his agent was human - and dangerous!\\" Science fiction author Gene Wolfe wrote, \\"The first [sf] story I read was 'Microcosmic God' by Theodore Sturgeon. It has sometimes occurred to me that it has all been downhill from there.\\"  Cultural influence  Microcosmic God is an early example of the use of the 'pocket universe' concept in science fiction. The concept of a microcosmic universe manipulated or created within a larger, parent universe developed by Sturgeon was later to be reconstructed in television on shows like The Twilight Zone, Simpsons, Futurama, South Park, and Rick and Morty. * The Little People (Twilight Zone, 1962) * The Genesis Tub (from Treehouse of Horror VII, Simpsons, 1996) * Osmosis Jones (Warner Brothers, 2001) * Godfellas (Futurama, 2002) * Simpsons Already Did It (South Park, 2002) * The Ricks Must Be Crazy (Rick and Morty, 2015)  References   External links  * Category:Short stories by Theodore Sturgeon Category:1941 short stories Category:Works originally published in Analog Science Fiction and Fact ","title":"Microcosmic God"},{"id":"14987499","text":"Specter of the Rose is a 1946 film noir thriller film written and directed by Ben Hecht and starring Judith Anderson, Ivan Kirov, Viola Essen, Michael Chekhov, and Lionel Stander, with choreography by Tamara Geva, and music by George Antheil.. Plot A male ballet superstar is suspected of murdering his first wife (his former ballet partner) and now possibly threatening his new wife and ballet partner. Andre Sanine has not performed since his wife's death on stage. He has been haunted by Le Spectre de la Rose, the music being played when she collapsed. But he is willing to attempt a comeback arranged by impresario Max \\"Poli\\" Polikoff, who tries to persuade ballet instructor Madame La Sylph that the time has come for Sanine, her former student, to return. Sanine is to perform with Haidi, the company's new prodigy. As they rehearse, they also fall in love. La Sylph cautions her that she saw Sanine's rage in person before Nina's death. Haidi attempts to keep Sanine by her side for several days, concerned over signs of a relapse in his behavior. Hearing the music, Sanine picks up a knife and places it at the throat of the sleeping Haidi, the woman he loves.

Adaptation The screenplay was adapted for the radio series Inner Sanctum Mysteries on August 19, 1946. Ben Hecht appeared and the script was adapted by the playwright and Broadway stage actor Robert Sloane. Reception When the film was released, Variety magazine gave the film a mixed review. The staff wrote, \\"Ben Hecht, to say the least, has done the expected by coming up with the unusual. Specter of the Rose was obviously a conscious attempt by Hecht to prove on how small a budget he could produce an acceptable picture. Reports are that it cost in the neighborhood of $160,000. The serious defect production wise is a general lack of polish that is at times disturbing ... Hecht’s direction and dialog give the acting a stylized artificiality that grows on the spectator as the picture progresses. Satire of the characterizations makes many of the film’s people virtually caricatures.\\"Variety. Staff film review, 1946. Accessed: July 26, 2013.

Function  This gene encodes the acidic form of complement factor 4, part of the classical activation pathway. The protein is expressed as a single chain precursor which is proteolytically cleaved into a trimer of alpha, beta, and gamma chains prior to secretion. The trimer provides a surface for interaction between the antigen-antibody complex and other complement components. The alpha chain may be cleaved to release C4 anaphylatoxin, a mediator of local inflammation. Deficiency of this protein is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus and type I diabetes mellitus. Excess production is associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with psychosis. This gene localizes to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III region on chromosome 6.

Grand Princes of the Hungarians * Álmos (c. 850 – c. 895) * Árpád (c. 895 – c. 907) * Zolta (c. 907 – c. 950) * Fajsz (c. 950 – c. 955) * Taksony (c. 955 – c. 970) * Géza (c. 970 – 997) * Stephen / Vajk (997 – 1000, became the first king of the Hungarians) We do not know exactly how many grand princes of Hungary ruled between the supposed death date of Árpád‘s death (c. 907) and Fajsz (c. 948), because it seems that the chroniclers of the Hungarian kings, who came from the branch of Solt after 1000, wanted to make the people of the kingdom, to forget the rule between 907 and 950, of the other branches of the Árpád dynasty, coming from the other 3 sons of Árpád: Tarkacsu/Liüntika, Jelek, Jutocsa, who, or their offspring probably ruled at this period Hungary, according to the nomadic custom of agnatic seniority, used by the Hungarian rulers before 1000.Szabados György: Magyar államalapítások a IX-XI. században; Szegedi Középkori Könyvtár, Szeged, 2011, p. 244 The quietness of the chronicles is the reason why today's historians cannot establish precisely the whole list of the Hungarian grand princes between 907-955, and we know only about Solt (from the Hungarian chronicles) and Fajsz from the book of the Byzantine emperor Constantine VII, De Administrando Imperio, which preserved a longer list of names from the Árpád-family, than the Hungarian chronicles, preoccupied only with the ruling branch of Solt. The reason of forgetting Fajsz from the Hungarian chronicles was the fact that he was not son of Solt, but of Jutocsa, and without the help of De Administrando Imperio, we would not know anything about his existence. The De Administrando Imperio preserved the name of Fajsz as the Grand Prince of the Hungarians, because it was written during his reign. But about the names of the other grand princes, who were not from the branch of Solt, who probably ruled before and after him, we know nothing.

Byzantium actually tried to maintain friendly relations with both the Golden Horde and the Ilkhanate realms, who were often at war with each other. The alliance involved numerous exchanges of presents, military collaboration and marital links, but dissolved in the middle of the 14th century. Diplomatic overtures Soon after the Battle of Köse Dağ in 1243, the Empire of Trebizond surrendered to the Mongol Empire while the court of Nicaea put its fortresses in order.A. A. Vasiliev History of the Byzantine Empire, 324-1453, p.531 In the early 1250s, the Latin emperor of Constantinople Baldwin II sent an embassy to Mongolia in the person of the knight Baudoin de Hainaut, who, following his return, met in Constantinople with the departing William of Rubruck.Richard, p. 377. William of Rubruck also noted that he met an envoy of John III Doukas Vatatzes, emperor of Nicaea, at the court of Möngke Khan in circa 1253. Alliance under Michael VIII (1263–1282) Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos, after re-establishing Byzantine Imperial rule, established an alliance with the Mongols,Richard, p. 453. \\"The sustained attacks by the Sultan Baibars (…) rallied the Occidentals to this alliance [with the Mongols], to which the Mongols also convinced the Byzantines to adhere.\\" who themselves were highly favourable to Christianity, as a minority of them were Nestorian Christians. He signed a treaty in 1263 with the Mongol Khan of the Kipchak (the Golden Horde),Cambridge, p. 304. and he married two of his daughters (conceived through a mistress, a Diplovatatzina) to Mongol kings: Euphrosyne Palaiologina, who married Nogai Khan of the Golden Horde, and Maria Palaiologina, who married Abaqa Khan of Ilkhanid Persia.Canal and Runciman, p. 320. According to a 1267 letter by Pope Clement IV from Viterbo, Abaqa had agreed to combine forces with his father-in-law Michael VIII to help the Latins in the Holy Land, in preparation for the Eighth Crusade (the second of Louis IX): In 1265 Berke Khan sent the Golden Horde army under Noghai to Thrace, prompting to force the Byzantines to release the Mamluk envoy and the former Seljuk Sultan Kaykaus II. According to Egyptian sources, Michael agreed to send fabrics to the Mongol Khan in Russia. When Michael realized the importance of the Mongols and became an ally of Noghai, he used his help to defend himself against Bulgaria when it tried to attack the Byzantine Empire in 1273 and 1279.Jackson, pp. 202-203. A group of 4,000 Mongol soldiers were dispatched to Constantinople in 1282, just before the death of Michael, to fight against the despot of Thessaly.Jackson, p. 203.Heath and McBride, p. 24. Alliance under Andronikos II (1282–1328) After 1295, Andronikos II offered Ghazan a marital alliance, in exchange for Mongol help to fight against the Turcomans at the Oriental frontier of the Byzantine Empire. Ghazan accepted the offer and promised to stop the incursions.Luisetto, pp. 144-145, referencing Pachymeres. The death of Ghazan in 1308 was mourned by the Byzantines.Luisetto, p. 145. This alliance would continue under Ghazan's successor, Oljeitu. In 1305 Ilkhan Oljeitu promised Andronicus II 40,000 men, and in 1308 dispatched 30,000 men to recover many Byzantine towns in Bithynia.Heath and McBride, pp. 24–33. Andronicus II gave daughters in marriage to Toqto'a, as well as his successor Uzbek (1312–1341), but relations turned sour at the end of Andonicus's reign and the Mongols mounted raids on Thrace between 1320 and 1324, until the Byzantine port of Vicina Macaria was occupied by the Mongols. End of friendly relations Under Andronikos III relations seem to have turned even more conflictual. In 1341, the Mongols planned to attack Constantinople, and Andronikos III had to send an embassy to stop the attack.

Its capital was Legnica (Liegnitz) in Lower Silesia. Legnica Castle had become a residence of the Silesian dukes in 1163 and from 1248 was the seat of a principality in its own right, ruled by the Silesian branch of the Piast dynasty until the extinction of the line in 1675. Formed by Bolesław II the Bald, Duke of Lower Silesia at Wrocław, Legnica shared the fate of most of the others Silesian duchies, falling into Bohemian, Austrian and eventually - after the First Silesian War - Prussian spheres of influence. History The town of Legnica became famous for the Battle of Legnica that took place at the nearby village of Legnickie Pole on 9 April 1241, during the Mongol invasion of Poland. A Christian army led by the Polish High Duke Henry II the Pious, supported by the feudal nobility including Poles, Bavarian miners and military orders, was decisively defeated by the Mongols. Although Henry was killed and his forces defeated, their advance into Europe was halted when they turned back to attend to the election of a new Khagan (Grand Khan) following the death of Ögedei Khan in the same year. Minor celebrations are held annually in Legnica to commemorate the battle. =Establishment= Legnica Castle After Henry's death his eldest son Bolesław II the Bald followed him as ruler of Lower Silesia until in 1248 his younger brother Henry III the White came of age and claimed his rights of succession. Backed by the nobility of Wrocław, Henry III forced the duke to cede central parts of Lower Silesia to him, while Bolesław himself retired to Legnica. Furthermore, he came into conflict with his younger brother Konrad, who, originally predestined for an ecclesiastical career as Bishop of Passau, also demanded his distributive share and had to be paid off by Bolesław with the newly created Duchy of Głogów in 1251. Nevertheless, Bolesław's son Henry V the Fat, who succeeded his father in 1278, was able to enlarge the duchy's territories by defeating his cousin Henry Probus, Duke of Wrocław, and, with support of King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia succeeded him as duke in 1290. Thus, the Lower Silesian duchies of Legnica and Wrocław were re-reunited until 1311. As after the death of Henry V in 1296 his eldest son Bolesław III the Generous was still a minor, King Wenceslaus took over his guardianship, strengthening the Bohemian influence in Silesia. In 1303 Bolesław III was betrothed to Wenceslaus' daughter Margaret and to no avail tried to follow the extinct Přemyslid dynasty on the Bohemian throne in 1306. He was not able to retain the united duchy and in 1311 Lower Silesia was split again, with Wrocław going to his younger brother Henry VI the Good. Even Bolesław's rule over Legnica was contested by his brother Władysław and in 1329 he had to pay homage to the Bohemian King John of Luxembourg to secure his reign. As the duchy's capital at the beginning of the 14th century, Legnica was an important city of Central Europe, with a population of approximately 16,000 residents. The city began to expand quickly after the discovery of gold in the Kaczawa. =Bohemian rule= First geographical map of Lower Silesia (to south) by Martin Helwig, 1561 A Bohemian vassal from 1329 on, the political weakness of the duchy continued, caused by domestic conflicts between Bolesław's sons Wenceslaus and Louis the Fair strengthening the influences of the Bohemian monarchs. When in 1419 the Legnica branch of the Silesian Piasts became extinct with the death of Duke Wenceslaus II, the duchy was inherited by Duke Louis II of Brzeg. As Louis himself had no male heirs, Legnica was annexed as a ceased fief by the Bohemian king Sigismund in 1436. A long-standing dispute arose, as the late Duke Louis II had bequeathed his estates to the sons of his step-brother Duke Henry IX of Lubin –though without the consent of the Bohemian overlord. Eventually, in 1455 the duchy was inherited by Frederick I, the son of Louis' daughter Hedwig, who was officially enfeoffed by King Matthias Corvinus in 1469. Frederick's son Frederick II, Duke from 1499, again inherited the Duchy of Brzeg in 1520. The Protestant Reformation was introduced in the duchy as early as 1522, decisively promoted by the theologians Caspar Schwenckfeld and Valentin Krautwald, and the population quickly turned Lutheran. This led to conflict when, after the death of the Bohemian King Louis II at the Battle of Mohács in 1526, the Lands of the Bohemian Crown including the Legnica fief were incorporated into the Habsburg Monarchy of the Catholic king Ferdinand. In turn, Duke Frederick II signed an inheritance pact with the Hohenzollern elector Joachim II Hector of Brandenburg, a cousin of his second wife Sophia. However, King Ferdinand I, rejecting any Hohenzollern influence within the Habsburg lands, declared the agreement null and void. The struggles continued, though the duchy was officially guaranteed freedom of religion by the 1648 Peace of Westphalia. After the death of the last Piast duke, George William, in 1675, Legnica passed to the direct rule of the Habsburg emperor Leopold I, despite claims raised by Elector Frederick William of Brandenburg referring to the inheritance pact in 1537. For the Prussian king Frederick the Great, the old dispute was a pretext to justify his campaign during the First Silesian War: in 1742 most of Silesia including Legnica was occupied by the Prussian Army after Empress Maria Theresa's defeat in the War of the Austrian Succession. Finally in 1763 the duchy lost most of its privileges after being incorporated into Prussia according to the Peace of Hubertusburg.

Originally built by his uncle, he remodelled it from 1306, the old family castle taking on the architectural layout of the neighbouring castle, the Château de Villandraut.Ministry of Culture: Château fort In 1422-23, the English king Henry VI took possession of the castle and put it in the charge of Pons, lord of Castillon. Around 1433, Henry conceded the lands and castle to his son, the Duke of Gloucester. In 1446-47, Budos was given to the Count of Foix, following the death of Gloucester. After the conquest of Guyenne (Aquitaine), the Budos family, having supported the cause of the French crown, regained possession of its seigneuries in Guyenne. In 1652, the cavalry captain Lasserre seized Budos which he sacked and pillaged and burnt the archives. The seigneury of Budos stayed in the family of La Roque until the French Revolution. In 1825, the castle was sold as national property. In 1851, the Gironde Commission of Historic Monuments was informed of the castle. They learned at the same time that stones originating from the castle had been sold to a builder by the state. Architecture The castle is rectangular in plan. A vast U-shaped building range around the courtyard is protected by a high wall contained by towers at the corners. Entry is made through a high square tower. On each face, a non-projecting square tower dominates the curtain wall and the buildings. The north-east curtain wall seems to have been raised several times. The crenellations of the first roundwalk have been filled in. The ground level appears flat today thanks to embankments which have been placed there. Originally, the ground sloped and the architecture provides evidence of the different levels. The Château de Budos has been classified since 1988 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.

Weiner's books have been translated into more than 20 languages. He is a former foreign correspondent for NPR and the author of numerous articles about travel and culture. He spent a decade overseas for NPR, based in New Delhi, Jerusalem and Tokyo. In \\"The Socrates Express\\" Weiner follows in the footsteps of some of history's greatest thinkers -- ranging from Epicurus to Thoreau to Confucius to Simone Weil -- and offers practical and spiritual lessons for today's unsettled times. Weiner travels mostly by train to pilgrimage to the places around the world where these thinkers lived and where their ideas resonate today, making stops in Athens, Delhi, Wyoming, Kyoto, Frankfurt, Coney Island and places in between. Publishers Weekly says that Weiner in \\"The Socrates Express\\" \\"makes a convincing and winningly presented case for the practical applications of philosophy to everyday existence in the 21st century. With humor and thoughtfulness, he distills the wisdom of thinkers from throughout history....His book offers an appealing way to cope with the din of modern life and look at the world with attentive eyes and ears.\\" title=The Socrates Express: In Search of Life Lessons from Dead Philosophers. Booklist gives \\"The Socrates Express\\" a starred review In The Geography of Genius, Weiner travels from Athens to Silicon Valley, and throughout history, to show how creative genius flourishes in specific places at specific times. Walter Isaacson, bestselling author of Steve Jobs and The Innovators, says, \\"Why do certain places produce a spontaneous eruption of creativity? What made Athens and Florence and Silicon Valley? This witty and fun book has an insight in every paragraph. It’s a charming mix of history and wisdom cloaked as a rollicking travelogue filled with colorful characters.” Dan Gilbert, Harvard professor and author of the bestseller Stumbling on Happiness, calls The Geography of Genius \\"an intellectual odyssey, a traveler’s diary, and a comic novel all rolled into one. Smart, original, and utterly delightful, this is Weiner’s best book yet.” The Wall Street Journal review said that “There are some writers whose company is worth keeping, whatever the subject… And Mr. Weiner is blessed with this gift. He is a prober and questioner, a big-hearted humanist who will always take a colorful, contradictory reality over some unfounded certainty.” In The Geography of Bliss, Weiner traveled to spots around the globe—including Iceland, Bhutan, Moldova and Qatar—to search out how different countries define and pursue happiness. In Man Seeks God he explores his spiritual restlessness and asks some fundamental questions: \\"Where do we come from? What happens when we die? How should we live our lives?

The station opened on 1 August 1891 with the section of the line between Cirencester Watermoor and the junction at Andoversford with the Great Western Railway's Cheltenham Lansdown to Banbury line, which had opened in 1881. Foss Cross was an isolated station, and the nearest village was Chedworth, over a mile away, and that petitioned successfully for its own station, which opened just a year later. Other villages such as Bibury were up to four miles away. The result was that the station was very lightly used for passenger traffic and towards the end of its life only one passenger a day used it regularly.Gloucestershire Railway Stations, Mike Oakley, Dovecote Press, Wimborne, 2003, However, what it lacked in passengers it made up in goods traffic. The station handled much agricultural traffic until the 1930s and there was also a set of sidings leading to stone quarries. Some of the stone was used by the railway, and water from the large water tower at Cirencester Watermoor station was hauled regularly to Foss Cross sidings in rail-mounted tankers to supply the stone crushing equipment located there. Foss Cross station closed to both passengers and goods when the line closed to all traffic in 1961. The main station building and part of the platform remained in 2013, along with a cattle dock, two huts and foundations of the goods shed.

Van Burmania was born in a small village in Friesland as the son of Jeepke van Douma and Sjuck van Burmania,http://tresoar.nl/freegjesam/as_web.exe?dregio09+D+20065867 a military man and later a councillor at the Court of Friesland from 1710 to 1721. After a military career, Barthold became an ambassador in Cologne in 1739Inventory of the legation with the German Emperor, 1699-1807 and later at the court of Vienna. He was a man of broad humanitarian sympathies and an especially staunch friend of the Jews. When, in the 1740s, Maria Theresa ordered the expulsion of the Jews from Prague (to take place before the end of January 1745) and from all Bohemia (before the end of June 1745) Burmania, at the request of the Jewish communities of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and The Hague, exerted all his influence at the court to have the edict revoked. He was assisted by the English minister, Sir Thomas Robinson. The result of his efforts was the postponement of the date of exile to the last day of February 1745. Again the Jewish communities of Holland appealed to Burmania, and again he pleaded, urged, and remonstrated with the Austrian Reichskanzler (Chancellor), that \\"sovereigns, more than other persons, are responsible to God and man for their deeds.\\" Another month of grace was granted, but on 31 March 1745 the Jews of Prague were exiled. Thereupon, Burmania, supported by the ambassadors of England, Poland, and Turkey, directed his energies toward averting the expulsion of the Jews from the whole of Bohemia, which was to take place in June. A royal edict was issued on 8 April 1745, ordering all Jews of Moravia also to emigrate within a short time. Again Burmania pleaded for them, and the edicts were modified on 15 May 1745, the Jews being allowed to remain in Bohemia and Moravia \\"until further orders\\".

Biography Sir Robert was the son of Robert Knollys and Elizabeth Troutbeck, paternal grandson of Sir Richard Knollys and Margaret D'Oyley, and maternal grandson of Sir John Troutbeck and Margaret Hulse. In 1488 Knollys was one of Henry VII's henchmen, and late in that year was appointed to wait on ‘the king's dearest son the prince’ (Arthur). He received £5 ‘by way of reward’ for each of the three years 1488 to 1490, and when Henry VII met Archduke Philip in 1500, Knollys accompanied the English king as one of the ushers of the chamber. He continued in the same office under Henry VIII, and received an annuity of £20, on 15 November 1509, and a grant of Upclatford, called Rookes Manor, in Hampshire — part of the confiscated property of Sir Richard Empson — on 10 February 1510/11. On 9 July 1514 the usher and his wife were jointly granted the manor of Rotherfield Greys, near Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, in survivorship, at an annual rental of a red rose at midsummer. The grant was confirmed on 5 January 1517/18 by letters patent for their own lives and that of one successor. Other royal gifts followed. Robert Knollys died in 1521, and was buried in the church of St Helen's Bishopsgate. His will, dated 13 November 1520, was proved 19 June 1521. His widow, Letitia or Lettice, was daughter of Sir Thomas Penyston or Penystone, of Hawridge and Marsworth, both in Buckinghamshire, and Alice Bulstrode, and granddaughter of Sir Richard Penystone and Margaret Herris, and Richard Bulstrode and Alice Knyffe. After Robert Knollys's death she became the second wife of Sir Robert Lee, of Burston, Buckinghamshire, son of Richard Lee (died c.1500) and Joan Saunders (d.1516). Sir Robert Lee, by whom she had issue, died in 1539, when she became the second wife of Sir Thomas Tresham of Rushton, Northamptonshire, prior (under Queen Mary of England) of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem. Her will, dated 28 June 1557, was proved 11 June 1558. Robert Knollys's children included Francis Knollys, a son Henry and two daughters, Mary and Jane. The latter married Sir Charles Wingfield of Kimbolton Castle. The son Henry (died 1583) was in some favour with Edward VI and Queen Elizabeth. He went abroad with his brother Francis during Queen Mary of England's reign. In 1562 he was sent on a diplomatic mission to Germany, to observe the temper of German Protestants, and in 1569 was temporarily employed in warding both Mary, Queen of Scots, at Tutbury and the Duke of Norfolk in the Tower. He was M.P. for Reading in 1563, and for Christchurch in 1572. His will, dated 27 July 1582, was proved 2 September 1583.

Aimed at producing browser- based multiplayer games and environments in general, it has been around since 1999 and has been used for MMORPG games, research, education and promotional applications. Written in Java and supporting a number of languages including eastern languages such as Chinese and Russian, DimensioneX has been present on SourceForge.net since its beginning.  Key Features  * The game world is defined via a dedicated language, named DXW (DimensioneX World) format. The syntax lets the programmer to define rooms, doors/links, items, characters. * All the remaining necessary interaction is then added via an object-oriented scripting language that is very similar to Visual Basic/VBScript. * The engine is not a graphics engine, the client is a combination of a server-generated combination of HTML, JavaScript. Scene graphics is obtained by stacking static images and icons provided by the programmer. * The engine supports in-game sounds and music, as well as flash files and other types of files.  Architecture  The engine of DimensioneX is written in Java language, and relies on HTML+JavaScript for the client part. The server object is actually a single Java Servlet that gets instantiated at startup, it reads the world definition from its descriptive DXW file and re-creates it in memory. From then on, the main servlet keeps the word's state in memory and accepts client commands to update the position of characters and items of the managed world. The clients are assumed to communicate with the main core via the standard HTTP POST protocol. Messages include a number of commands such as: login, logout, view (gets a view of the current room the player is in), move (4 directions plus up and down), pick, drop, and a number of custom commands with up to 2 parameters. Communication between the client and the server is asynchronous and multiple commands can be sent in parallel. Inside the game core a critical section is implemented using a semaphore to ensure resource and game consistency (e.g. an item cannot be picked up by more than one person). Inside the DimensioneX world everything happens in real time even though, due to intrinsic nature of web platform used, if nobody is using a game time inside it says \\"frozen\\" so that everything happens at the first client contact with server. The communication method between the server core (Servlet) and the client (normally HTML with JavaScript) makes it possible to implement a client in any architecture, including mobile devices. The game engine is Open Source and open to any user's contribution. It has been used and adopted for several human - to computer interaction studies (see: References)  Games  * One of the most popular games written with DimensioneX is the Fantasy MMORPG Game Sottomondo whose English version is known as Underworld Online. * Network Arena, sci-fi MMORPG. * Another one that is fairly popular in Italy was Dragon Hunter game  References  * Interaction - Amvient, Ubiquitous and Intelligent Interaction, Juile A.

The 6'7 power forward returned to England in 2006 to sign with rookie professional outfit Worcester Wolves in the BBL.

Averaging 26.48 minutes per game, Noel posted 8.57 points and 7.96 rebounds in his first season out of college. However, it was finishing seventh in the Floor Shooting percentages table, with a tally of 54.19% that raised awareness amongst rival coaches in the league. Plymouth Raiders head coach Gary Stronach was the quickest to react and immediately signed him during the 2007 close-season. Although initially signed as a back-up forward to Raiders' 2007 MVP Gaylon Moore, Noel displayed his tough play and strong hustle whenever he got the chance and soon forced his way up the pecking-order on Raiders' deep bench.

This federally funded program is administered by the State of Louisiana. According to the Road Home website, as of December 2017, the program had disbursed a total of $9.022 billion in awards to 130,052 individual homeowners in the area, with grants averaging $69,379 each. These are cash grants, not low interest loans, and are received income tax free. They are on top of insurance awards, private or federal, which may have already been received. Additionally, the program has been extended to provide cash grants to facilitate the elevation of homes in flood prone areas. According to the Road Home web site, \\"32,389 applicants have received elevation disbursements totaling $942,865,530\\". The Road Home Program's local office officially closed in March 2018, however, the program's official website has continued to post Situation and Pipeline reports into January 2020. In addition, the Small Rental Property Program page was updated approximately two months after the Road Home office closure. Like Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Road Home has been the target of criticism.See, e.g., the English Wikipedia article on the Times-Picayune. In 2011, a serious settlement was reached between African-American Katrina victims and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center v. HUD brought to light racially discriminatory impacts of the Road Home Program's practical design. This suit alleged that the algorithm used by the program to determine how much money to grant in each case was inherently biased, even if unintentionally. Substantial evidence from the program's own data showed that under this formula, African American homeowners were significantly less likely than white homeowners to receive grants based upon the estimated cost to repair damage. Instead, many African American homeowners were granted money based upon the supposed pre-storm market value of their homes. After the local office closed its doors in 2018, financial and legal matters related to the Road Home Program were largely handed over to Shows, Cali & Walsh, L.L.P., the law firm contracted by Louisiana Office of Community Development. As recently as March 2020, Shows, Cali & Walsh, L.L.P. has taken over suing many Road Home Program grant recipients, alleging that the defendants received too much funding or used this funding improperly. As of March 2020, over 800 of these suits have been filed.

The number of these rural school districts in New York peaked statewide at 11,750 in 1865.The Encyclopedia of New York State (2005), Syracuse University Press, page 1341. New York state legislation required that the administration of schools would be in the hands of school districts — not the counties or towns, as is the case in 20 other states. This system of school districts totally independent of municipal or county governments remains in place throughout all of New York (except for New York City) today.The Encyclopedia of New York State (2005), Syracuse University Press, pages 1370-1271. (In the mid-1930s, the City of Newburgh built and opened its first Junior High Schools, one for 7th to 9th Grade students living north of Broadway and/or First Streets, and another for students living south of that geography. Today, these schools have become \\"Middle Schools\\" in the N. E. S. D., for all intents and purposes.) An 1875 map on display at Town Hall indicates that at that time 14 different school districts existed in Newburgh, each of which had its own schoolhouse, each of which elected its own school board, and each of which hired its own teachers.Map on display in the office of the Town Clerk, Town Hall, 1496 Route 300, Town of NewburghFavata, Patricia A., Around Orange Lake, Images of America series, 2007, Syracuse University Press. As late as the mid 1950s, it was common in the town for one teacher to teach more than one grade in one classroom. In the post World War II era, with the first explosion in population in the town (as the town began the transition from rural to suburban) as well as with \\"Baby boomers\\" beginning their schooling, the need came about for larger and more modern school buildings. During the 1950s, new elementary schools were built in Balmville, Gardnertown, East Coldenham, Leptondale and Union Grove. Fostertown School retained its older building, but the first of several modern additions was constructed in 1957. Each of these elementary schools had their own locally elected school boards. Each had clearly defined boundaries which determined which elementary school each student would attend. Attendance at high school was not universal prior to World War II, but after that time most Newburgh students attended the two junior high schools (North Junior High and South Junior High) and one high school (Newburgh Free Academy, popularly known as NFA) in the city of Newburgh. From 1925 on, New York encouraged school districts to consolidate and approved legislation, featuring the incentive of state financial aid, to facilitate this.The Encyclopedia of New York State (2005), Syracuse University Press, page 1341. However, as late as 1960, there were still nine elementary school districts, and nine elementary schools, in the town.Maps and records on file in the office to the Town Assessor of Real Property, Town Hall, 1496 Route 300, Town of Newburgh. (The missing district numbers on the following chart are those of school districts previously consolidated with neighboring districts.) The following are the nine school districts as they existed in 1960: *District One: Balmville *District Three: Orange Lake *District Four: Fostertown *District Five: Roseton *District Eight: Gardnertown *District Nine: Middle Hope *District Ten: East Coldenham *District Eleven: Union Grove *District Fourteen: Leptondale In 1963, the Newburgh Enlarged City School District was formed. It consisted of the entire city of Newburgh and most of the town of New Windsor. In addition, it absorbed the following school districts within the town of Newburgh: Balmville (District One), Orange Lake (District Three), Fostertown (District Four), Gardnertown (District Eight), and Union Grove (District Eleven). At the same time, the Newburgh Enlarged City School District absorbed several elementary school districts in the Town of New Windsor, to the south. The Newburgh Enlarged City School District took over ownership and management of the five elementary schools in the town of Newburgh absorbed by the school district as well as those in the Town of New Windsor. In addition, town of Newburgh and New Windsor students for the first time attended the junior high schools of the Newburgh Enlarged City School District and NFA without any special tuition having to be paid. Residents of these portions of the towns were afforded full privileges at the Newburgh Free Library free of charge.

Although not intended to replace a healthy diet, prenatal vitamins provide women of childbearing age with nutrients recognized by the various health organizations including the American Dietetic Association as helpful for a healthy pregnancy outcome. It may be appropriate to start taking prenatal vitamins once the woman enters childbearing age. Prenatal vitamins are similar to other multivitamins but do contain different amounts of specific nutrients to better suit the needs of an expecting mother. Customizations Vitamins and minerals such as folic acid, calcium, and iron are in higher concentrations, while nutrients such as vitamin A are reduced to reflect the current understanding of the role that these compounds play in fetal development. The increased dosage of folic acid or folates reflects the American Dietetic Associations position that women should consume “400 μg per day of synthetic folic acid from fortified foods (cereals and other grains), supplements or both, in addition to consuming folate from foods in a varied diet.” Taking the appropriate amount of folic acid before conception can reduce or prevent the incidence of neural tube defects by as much as 70%. The recommendation to start folic acid before conception is supported by a meta-analysis of 41 studies, but is beneficial after conception as well. Often prenatal vitamins also have a reduced dosage of vitamins that may be detrimental to the fetus when taken in high doses (such as vitamin A). Many prenatal manufacturers have chosen to include the omega-3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in their product, either as an ingredient in the formula or as a complementary softgel. Although explicitly in many formulas to support neural development, the omega-3 fatty acids are used by both mother and fetus to create the phospholipid bilayer that makes up cell membranes. L-arginine has tentative evidence of benefit in reducing intrauterine growth restriction. Side effects Many women have difficulty tolerating prenatal vitamins or experience constipation as a result of the high iron content. Due to tolerance challenges, the prenatal vitamin industry has developed a multitude of dosage forms to meet the needs and tolerances of expecting mothers. The most common form of prenatal vitamin is the compressed tablet which is available through all channels and at various quality levels. Category leaders utilize this as the dosage form of choice. Other organizations within the category offer products in a variety of dosage forms such as liquids, prenatal vitamin soft chews, vitamin chewables, and even jellied prenatal vitamins. Availability Prenatal vitamins are available both over the counter in retail stores as well as by prescription from medical professionals. Although prescription vitamins are often covered by insurance, the relative potency of prescription-grade products are typically not significantly different from those available through retail. Differences in prescription versus retail vitamins do however exist in consistency and quality level, as well as the relative bioavailability of some specific ingredients. For example, many prescription prenatal vitamins will contain a more bioavailable form of folate; 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF). Doses of folic acid over 1mg are prescription only. The amount of non-prescription prenatal vitamins needed to achieve this dose may have too much vitamin A and lead to fetal toxicity.

Biography  The 6 ft tall point guard began his career with the BBL Championship winning Chester Jets team of the 2004/05 season, making his debut in a home match against Sheffield Sharks on 1 October 2004. He also helped the team to the Play-off final that season, eventually losing to Newcastle Eagles, 75-78. By his second season, he had commanded a place in the starting five, and averaging an impressive 66% on free-throws and 55% from the floor, whilst also tallying 7.38 points in 23.72 minutes-per-game. Sadly, Martin missed the 2006/07 season through injury, but after fully recovering was announced as a surprise signing for the Plymouth Raiders during the 2007 close season, ironically coming in as a replacement for long-term injured captain Gavin Love. He quickly filled the void left by Love, and although faced some stiff competition from fellow new guard signing Brody Bishop and long-serving Raider Allister Gall, cemented his place in the first team. His blistering pace is the cornerstone of his game, and Raiders' head coach has claimed him to be the fastest player in the league, while other comparisons to NBA star Chris Paul have also been drawn. For the start of the 09-10 season Anthony signed for Worcester Wolves however things did not seem to work out for him as part of new coach Chuck Evans' team. Upon being released from his contract (by mutual consent) coach Gary Stronach moved quickly to secure Anthony's return to the South West's premiere basketball club. On 4 September 2012, Martin signed for Newcastle Eagles to provide competition in the Point Guard position to Damon Huffman. Martin last played on the BBL during the 2012-13 season.

This vessel was considered one of the finest of its time. It was named after Bailey Gatzert, an early businessman and mayor of Seattle, who was one of the closest friends and business associates of John Leary – the person who financed the ship. Bailey Gatzert probably carried more passengers than any other Columbia River steamer. It was considered to be one of the most beautiful river boats, mainly because its upper deck ran all the way out to the bow. Ownership and cost Bailey Gatzert was built for John Leary (1837–1905). The steamer was reported to have cost $100,000 to construct. According to another report, the Bailey Gatzert was built for the Seattle Steam Navigation & Transportation Company, which had been incorporated in Seattle on May 31, 1890, with a capital stock of $500,000, by John Leary, Jacob Furth, Edward Newfleder, Wm.R. Ballard, and Harry K. Struve (1866–1924). Construction Bailey Gatzert was built in the shipyard of John J. Holland (1843-1893) at Ballard, Washington. The machinery for the steamer was manufactured by the James Rees Iron and Machine Works, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Holland was an experienced shipbuilder who had previously constructed the prominent steamers Wide West and R.R. Thompson. The machinery was scheduled to be delivered to the Bailey Gatzert by July 15, 1890, but it did not arrive on time from the east. As of July 20, the Rees firm was reported to be working on the machinery \\"night and day.\\" Work on the cabin structure of the steamer almost done by July 20, with the pilot house next to be built. Work was still ongoing on August 11, 1890, when a carload of machinery, including the sternwheel shaft, cylinders, donkey-pumps, and part of the smokestack arrived over the Northern Pacific Railway. Work was expected to be finished by September 15, 1890. However, the boilers did not arrive at Ballard until October 4, after a five-week delay. Engineering and dimensions Bailey Gatzert was driven by two twin horizontally mounted single cylinder poppet valve steam engines, each with a 22-inch interior bore diameter and an 84-inch stroke on the piston rod. These engines could drive the steamer at a speed of over 20 miles per hour. The engines generated 1,300 horsepower, enough it was said at the time of its launch, to make Bailey Gatzert the fastest steamer on Puget Sound. According to an official source, the engines generated 1,150 nominal horsepower and 1,300 indicated horsepower. The sternwheel had 17 \\"buckets\\" (paddles), each of which was 18 feet long. The boiler was a steel locomotive type, also manufactured by James Rees & Sons. The total heating surface was 3800 square feet. The firebox had a grate surface of 49 square feet. The underwater portion of the steamer's hull was coated with a copper-based bottom paint. As built no sleeping accommodations were installed, limiting the vessel to day trips. The vessel was originally a wood burner, and could consume up to three cords of wood an hour. According to a newspaper report, Bailey Gatzert was 208 feet long overall, with a length of 180 feet measured over the keel. The beam (width) of the vessel was 32 feet. The official dimensions of the steamer as built were: 177.3 feet length over the hull, exclusive of the extension of the main deck, called the fantail, over the stern, on which the sternwheel was mounted, 32.3 foot beam (width) and 8:0 foot depth of hold. The official merchant vessel registry number was 3488. Launch and trial trip Bailey Gatzert on the shipways at the John J. Holland yard, in Ballard, Washington, probably just prior to launch on Saturday, November 22, 1890. Bailey Gatzert was launched on Saturday, November 22, 1890 at 1:00 p.m. in the afternoon before 1,500 spectators. The launch was originally scheduled to occur at noon, but was delayed for an hour to allow the tide to come in. The steamer had been built on a cradle sideways to the water's edge 100 yards away. With the ways 177 feet long to accommodate the steamer's hull, this was the longest sideways launching ever attempted on the Pacific Coast of the United States. Four hundred people were on board as the boat slid down into the water after the builder, Capt. J.J. Holland gave the word and the workman knocked away the restraining blocks. As the steamer entered the water, Captain Holland's young son, Willie Holland, broke a bottle of champagne over its bow. Bailey Gatzert had steam up before the launch and was operational when it entered the water. Capt. George Hill was in the pilot house and he ordered the engines to be started, and the vessel began its first trip, out towards the mouth of Salmon Bay and then south to Seattle. On board at the time were several prominent steamboat men, captains James W. Troupe, J.N. McAlpine, and Captain Clancy of the Union Pacific steamboat division. Some final work needed to be done after the launch, including fitting details and installation of the dynamo for the electric lights. Operations Seattle circa 1891, with the Olympic Mountains visible in the distance On August 22, 1890, it was reported that Captain George Hill, previously of the steamer Henry Bailey, had accepted the position of captain of Bailey Gatzert, then still under construction. Starting Saturday, December 13, 1890, Bailey Gatzert was running twice daily on the Seattle-Tacoma route, departing from Baker's Wharf, at the foot of Seneca street, at 8:00 a.m., and 3:00 p.m., and, on the return, departing Tacoma at 10:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Bailey Gatzert was damaged while docked in a windstorm that struck Seattle on December 25, 1890. On January 19, 1891, Bailey Gatzert took an excursion of nearly 300 people to Olympia, Washington, making what was reported to have been the shortest running time then on record between the two cities, about three hours and 25 minutes. The steamer left Seattle at 9:12 a.m., and ran south along the west side of Vashon Island, through Colvos Passage, then known as the \\"West Passage\\". During this trip, the vessel stopped for about 15 minutes off Milton Point to repair the steam steering mechanism. On January 28, 1891, Bailey Gatzert was taken off the Seattle-Tacoma run because the business on the route was insufficient to make the steamer profitable. The Gatzert had lost about $2,000 in the time it had been operating on the run. It was hoped that the steamer could be returned to the Seattle-Tacoma route sometime in April. Bailey Gatzert could not be used on an overnight or other long route because it had no sleeping accommodations. Captains of the Gatzert in its first years on Puget Sound were Harry Struve, Henry Carter (1858-1930), John Jordison (b.1863), and others. New owners Bailey Gatzert made only a few runs for its original owners before being sold to the Columbia River and Puget Sound Navigation Company (CR&PSN;), which was also called the White Collar Line. In early February 1891, the articles of incorporation of CR&PSN; had been filed in Portland, Oregon. The capital stock was $500,000, and the incorporators were John Leary, of Seattle, Capt. Uriah Bonser \\"U.B.\\" Scott (1827-1913) and Lamar Boudinot \\"L.B.\\" Seeley (1851-1932), both of Portland, and Ernest Whitcomb Crichton (1850-1913), of Oswego, Oregon U.B. Scott was the president, John Leary, vice-president, L.B. Seeley, second vice-president, E.W. Crichton (or Creighton), secretary-treasurer. E.A. Seeley and Capt. Z.J. Hatch were directors, but Hatch's interest was soon bought out by the other principals in the firm. S.H. Brown was another founder of the company. The new company was going to operate steamboats on Puget Sound and on the Columbia River, specifically Flyer, Bailey Gatzert, and Antelope. By February 21, 1891, Bailey Gatzert was back on a route from Seattle to Tacoma and Olympia, in place of the slower propeller steamer Fleetwood, which was also owned by U.B. Scott. Bailey Gatzert was much faster than Fleetwood, and was scheduled to make the Seattle-Tacoma run in 1 hour 45 minutes. Racing against Greyhound On April 21, 1891, Bailey Gatzert raced the sternwheeler Greyhound from Tacoma to Seattle and back. The distance on this route was 28 miles. Greyhound was then a new vessel, built in 1890, with low cabin structure and a large stern-wheel, so much so that the Hound, as the steamer was called, was said to be \\"all wheel and whistle.\\" On the morning of April 21, 1891, both the Gatzert and the Hound were at the dock in Tacoma, when about 10:30 a.m. rumors began to spread that there would be a race between the two vessels on the route back to Seattle. Hundreds of people crowded onto the docks to witness the event. At 10:30 a.m. Greyhound, under Captain G.H. Parker, cast off lines and moved out into the water, waiting for the Gatzert, which at the same time blew the whistle indicating departure. However, just at that time a tiller block, part of the steering gear, broke on Gatzert, which required 45 minutes to fix. The Greyhound steamed around, waiting for the Gatzert. Finally, with the steering gear repaired, Captain Z.J. Hatch on Gatzert gave the order to go ahead to the engine room, and both steamers left Tacoma at high speed, blowing huge amounts of black smoke from their stacks, with Gatzert in the lead. By the time they reached the turning point in the channel at Point Robinson, Bailey Gatzert was well ahead of Greyhound, and the race seemed over. Greyhound had used much of its freshwater supply in waiting for the Gatzert at Tacoma, and by the time Point Robinson was reached, Greyhound's chief engineer Claude Trump had to use salt water in the boilers, which further reduced Greyhound's steam pressure and speed. By the time the Greyhound reached Alki Point, Bailey Gatzert was well ahead, but with more fuel feed into the firebox, Greyhound was able to close the gap, and by Duwamish Head, Greyhound was only 500 yards behind the Gatzert. At about this time, the steamers were recognized from the docks in Seattle, causing an excited ground to gather. During the remaining three miles across Elliott Bay, Greyhound continued to gain, but Bailey Gatzert was still first into the dock. However, on the return trip to Tacoma, where the steamers also raced, Greyhound beat the Gatzert by one and one-half minutes. Loss of a trophy The Union Pacific at that time had recently completed the steamer T.J. Potter, which was operating on Puget Sound. When Captain Troup, who was the manager of the Union Pacific's maritime division, noticed one day that John Leary and J.J. Holland, to honor Bailey Gatzerts speedy time between Tacoma and Seattle, were installing a silver-plated statue of a greyhound in the Gatzerts pilot house. Troup bet Leary and Holland that if T.J. Potter could best the Gatzert in a race, that they would turn over the greyhound trophy to the Potter. A few days later, after Troup had returned to Portland, he received a telegram from Archie Pease, captain of the Potter, who had been informed of the wager: \\"Passed the Gatzert this morning and led her into Seattle. Time 1:22½\\" Troup immediately replied: \\"Get the dog.\\" Later that day, Pease sent a telegram back to Troup: \\"Got the dog. It now adorns the pilot house of the T.J. Potter.\\" Transfer to the Columbia River Advertisement for the steamers of the Columbia River and Puget Sound Navigation Company, with Bailey Gatzert and Telephone running on the Columbia River. In 1892, Bailey Gatzert was transferred, under Capt. Gill Parker, to the Columbia River. Once on the Columbia, the steamer was used in excursions and as a spare boat until 1895, when it was extensively overhauled and then placed on the Portland-Astoria route. Captains in the early years on the Columbia were U.B. Scott, Frank B. Turner, Thomas Crang, and W.E. Larkins. On October 14, 1892, Bailey Gatzert was at Neah Bay, presumably en route to the Columbia river. In June 1893 it was reported that Bailey Gatzert would be put on the run from Portland to Clatsop Beach in the coming summer. On July 1, 1893, Bailey Gatzert was reported to be running in the excursion business in the Columbia River Gorge. Proposed transfer to San Francisco On July 19, 1893, it was reported that Bailey Gatzert had been purchased by parties from San Francisco, with the intent to use the steamer on the ferry run between that city and Oakland for the Davie line of ferries. Bailey Gatzert was intended to make a voyage south from the mouth of the Columbia River to San Francisco, which, if it had been accomplished, would have been one of the longest trips ever made by a sternwheeler on the Pacific coast. The only previous time this had been done was when the Annie Steward had come from San Francisco to be run in opposition to the Oregon Steam Navigation Company's Dixie Thompson. The sale did not go through; the negotiations appear to have stumbled upon the point of whether the buyer or the seller should pay to have the vessel transferred to San Francisco. Rivalry on the Astoria route In 1895, the chief competition for the Bailey Gatzert on the Astoria route were a pair of fast steamers owned by the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company, the T.J. Potter, which had been brought around from Puget Sound back to the Columbia River, and the R.R. Thompson. OR&N; also brought to the Columbia River the old sidewheeler North Pacific to handle the traffic from Astoria to the seaside resorts near Ilwaco, Washington. To meet this challenge, CR&PSN; spent nearly $20,000 in remodeling Bailey Gatzert into \\"one of the finest sternwheel steamers afloat.\\" They also chartered the sidewheeler Ocean Wave, which was operated as a through boat from Portland to Ilwaco. Bailey Gatzert alternated with the CR&PSN;'s elite sternwheeler Telephone, reputedly the fastest river steamer in the world, providing Astoria with the best river steamer service that it had ever had. New machinery was installed into the boat by engineer Charles H. Jennings (b.1851). On Sunday, March 3, 1895, Bailey Gatzert was to make a trial trip at Portland, Oregon, with the crew on board only. However, this did not take place due to a cracked steam feed pipe, which had to be replaced. On March 4, 1895, A. McGillis, steward of the fast steamer Telephone was assigned to superintend the fitting out of the interior of the Bailey Gatzert. On March 11, 1895, Bailey Gatzert arrived at Astoria. Bailey Gatzert departed Portland at 7:00 a.m., carrying the officers of the steamer's owners, the Columbia River and Puget Sound Navigation Company, and a large number of other passengers. An upper cabin deck, called a texas, had been constructed on the steamer. In the texas were fourteen staterooms, each with two single berths. These were said to be the best staterooms on the boat, because they were away from the noise of the lower decks and well-ventilated. The lower staterooms had two double berths in each. Two \\"exquisitely furnished\\" \\"'bridal chambers'\\" were located just off of the ladies cabin. The steward, McGillis, and the purser, Donahue, had cabins on the main cabin deck Up in the forward part of the texas there were cabins for the officers, including Captain Crang, Pilot Larkins, and Chief Engineer Evans. The steamer was now equipped with electric lighting, as well as new steam-driven steering gear, reportedly superior to the hydraulic gear installed on Telephone. New cylinders had been fitted into the steam engines, and a system of electric engine room telegraph bells had been installed. Operations on the Columbia River =The Portland-Astoria run= In March 1895, Bailey Gatzert made daily runs (except Sunday) from Portland to Astoria, departing from the dock at the foot of Alder Street at 7:00 p.m., on the downriver run, and, on the return, departing from Astoria at 7:00 p.m. At Astoria, connections were made to Ilwaco, Washington via the steamer Ilwaco, which called at Astoria every night. Tickets of all other lines were good for the Gatzert. The Bailey Gatzert had a unique four note musical steam whistle which had once been installed in the fast steamer Telephone. In March 1895 the steamer was having some difficulty with the whistle, so much so that it was said to have sounded \\"like the bellowing of a cow just recovering from a severe attack of the grippe.\\" By March 28, however, the whistle had been restored to its traditional sound. Reportedly, attempts to build another steam whistle on the Telephone, with the same sound, all failed. In May, 1895, Bailey Gatzert departed from Flavel's Wharf in Astoria, opposite to the Occident Hotel, daily at 7:00 p.m. for Portland, Sundays excepted. Fares one-way were $1.00, round trip, $1.50. The steamer's agency in Astoria was C.W. Stone. In September 1895, the CR&PSN; was running two steamers daily from Astoria to Portland. Telephone, the evening boat to Portland, departed Astoria at 7:00 p.m. daily except Sundays, and left Portland daily at 7:00 a.m. for Astoria. Bailey Gatzert, the morning boat, left Astoria Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday mornings at 6:45 a.m., and Sunday evening at 7:00 p.m., for Portland. The Gatzert departed Portland on the return Astoria daily at 8:00 p.m., except Saturday, when it left at 11:00 p.m., with no departure from Portland on Sunday. Every Tuesday and Thursday, at 8:00 a.m., the Ocean Wave ran straight through from Portland to Ilwaco, Washington, where it met the narrow gauge trains of the Ilwaco Railway and Navigation Company, which made connections with the resorts and other stops on the North Beach of Pacific County, Washington. Ocean Wave departed Ilwaco for Portland on Wednesday and Friday mornings at 7:30, Sunday night at 5:00. E.A. Seeley was the company's general agent in Portland. =Unionization= In August 1897, the deck hands of a number of river steamers, including the Bailey Gatzert, formed a union and on Saturday, August 21, 1897, they went out on strike. The hands sought a raise in pay from $35 a month to $40 a month. =Railroad competition= The railroad from Portland to Astoria was completed on April 4, 1898, but the first train, carrying 700 people, did not arrive until May 16. Rail service was able to advertise travel from Portland to Astoria in three and one-half hours. The fast time of a steamer on the Portland-Astoria river route was that of Telephone, which on July 4, 1887, made the 105 mile trip in 4 hours and 34¾ minutes. Completion of the railroad cut down sharply on the demand for river steamer service between Portland and Astoria. As of October 1899, fares had been reduced on the Gatzert's Portland-Astoria run, to 50 cents, with staterooms costing $1.25, and other berths less than one dollar. On December 3, 1900, the place of Bailey Gatzert on the Astoria run was taken by the steamer Hercules, while the Gatzert, having been in continuous service for almost two years, was withdrawn from service for an overhaul. Fairs on Hercules were just 25 cents for a trip to Astoria. The overhaul was complete on April 12, 1901, and the Gatzert was back on the Astoria run. =Portland–The Dalles route= Gatzert was not long on the Astoria route, and was reassigned to a run up the Columbia River Gorge on May 10, 1901, or before. Hercules again replaced Bailey Gatzert on the Astoria route. E. W. Crichton was the White Collar Line's agent in Portland, while A. J. Taylor was the company's agent in Astoria. About $25,000 was spent remodeling Bailey Gatzert in preparation for its new route up the Columbia River. The old poppet-valve engines were replaced by the slide valve engines from the steamer Telephone. Auxiliary rudders were installed to improve steering in the swift waters of the Columbia Gorge. Hull and cabin work was done by veteran shipbuilder Joseph Pacquet. The officers on the steamer at that time were Captain Fred Sherman, pilot Sydney Scammon, mate John Schiller, chief engineer Ruben Smith, and Dan O'Neil, purser. Smith and O'Neil were two of the most experienced officers on the Columbia river, each having worked on the early steamer Columbia in the 1850s. Bailey Gatzert passed Hood River on first regular trip on Tuesday, May 14, 1901, at 2:00. The steamer was advertised as making a roundtrip from Portland to The Dalles, departing Portland at 7:00 a.m. and leaving from The Dalles on the return trip at 5:00 p.m. In early July, 1901, running under the White Collar Line, the Gatzert was running between Portland and The Dalles daily except Sunday, when excursions were run. The steamer Tahoma was then running to Astoria on the Gatzert's old route. John M. Fillon was the line's agent in The Dalles. Prather & Barnes were the company's agents in Hood River. During the summers of 1901 and 1902, the Gatzert was reported to have \\"handled immense crowds of tourists\\". Gatzert was the first steamer to be able to make a round trip from Portland to The Dalles in one day. In June 1902, Gatzert set a record time on the run from The Dalles to Portland while carrying an excursion of members of the A.O.U.W. In 1903, the Columbia River & Puget Sound Navigation Company merged with The Dalles, Astoria & Portland Navigation Company, also known as the Regulator Line. This gave rise to \\"the most spectacular period of rivalry on the lower river\\" between Captain Scott's boats, the Gatzert and Telephone, the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company's Hassalo and T.J. Potter, and the independent steamer Charles R. Spencer, owned by Capt. Ernest W. Spencer. (1852-1930). By the end of July 1903, the steamers of the Regulator Line were making a connection with the Columbia River & Northern Railway, at Lyle, Washington, which would then carry passengers and freight to Wahkeans, Daly, Centerville, Goldendale and all Klickitat Valley points. H.C. Campbell was the manager of the Regulator line at this time. The Gatzert was taken off the Columbia Gorge route during the winter of 1903–1904. In February 1904, it was reported that the company was considering converting Bailey Gatzert into an oil-burner. In 1905 a new locomotive-type firebox boiler was installed. =Lewis and Clark Exposition= Cover sheet for the Bailey Gatzert March, 1905. During the Lewis and Clark Exposition of 1905, Bailey Gatzert made two excursions a day to Cascades Locks, in the Columbia Gorge, departing Portland at 8:30 a.m. and at 5:30 p.m., with a fare of $1.50, including meals served on board. A special tune was written for the steamer at this time, the \\"Bailey Gatzert March\\". 1907 reconstruction In 1907, Bailey Gatzert was rebuilt with a new and longer hull. Engines which had previously been in the Telephone were installed into the Gatzert. The boat was converted to an oil-burner from a wood-burner. In early April 1907 work was reportedly being rushed on the Bailey Gatzert. The length was increased 15 feet, with the beam staying practically the same. The freight house would be new, but the cabins of the older boat would be reused. The aft cabins on the hurricane deck were to be removed, and the area converted into a promenade J.H. Johnson designed the new Gatzert, and supervised its construction. Marcus Talbot was the manager of the Regulator Line at the time of the reconstruction. On Saturday, August 24, 1907, the new Gatzert was launched from the ways of the Portland Shipbuilding Company at 11:30 a.m. The launch was to have occurred earlier, on the first of July, but it was delayed by labor disputes and materials shortages. The new Gatzert was expected to receive a license to carry 350 passengers, with that number rising to 625 for excursions. The post-reconstruction trial trip of the vessel was taken on September 5, 1907, from Portland to the Columbia Gorge, with a number of dignitaries invited on board. Reportedly the rebuilt Gatzert had 50% more power than the original boat. Renewed competition with other steamers The steamers Charles R. Spencer, foreground, and Bailey Gatzert, background, both crowded with passengers, in the Cascades Locks, May 28, 1906 (from an old stereocard). In the spring of 1908, both the Gatzert and its competitor, the Charles R. Spencer, began their summer operations on the same day, May 4, 1908, with talk of a pending rate war between the management of the two steamers, both of which had been recently rehabilitated and were reported to be in top mechanical shape. The steamers raced that day to Vancouver, Washington and then up the Columbia River Gorge to The Dalles. Preparations for the race had been going on quietly for week beforehand. The Spencer and the Gatzert were reported to have been at that time the fastest steamboats in the world. Both steamers, with Fred Sherman in command of the Gatzert, and Ernest W. Spencer on the Spencer, left their docks on Portland at 7:00 a.m., passing downriver through the harbor at the double slow bell, with the Spencer leading. At 7:06 a.m. they passed through the Steel Bridge. To comply with a municipal ordinance restricting speed on the river, the boats took 13 minutes to reach the Portland Flour Mills, a distance they could cover in 4 minutes if moving at speed. At the flour mills, the race began in earnest. The Spencer held a lead of half a boat length down to Linnton, Oregon, where the Gatzert increased its speed and whistled a signal to the Spencer indicating its intent to pass. But the Spencer held the right of way and turned closer to the Oregon shore when the boats reached the junction of the Willamette and the Columbia, increasing its lead to three boat lengths on the stretch into Vancouver, which Spencer reached first, covering the 17 mile distance from Portland to Vancouver in 65 minutes. Both boats embarked a few passengers at Vancouver, and the Gatzert, with a better position at the dock, was able to cast off first, and keep and maintain a lead of two boat-lengths to the Cascade Locks, transiting the locks before the Spencer. Gatzert arrived at The Dalles at 2:32 p.m., with Spencer coming in 18 minutes later. Bailey Gatzert departed The Dalles at 2:50 p.m., even before the Spencer had arrived, returning to Portland, where the steamer tied up at 8:05 p.m., making the total running time for the round trip as 13 hours and 5 minutes. No freight was carried on either boat. In May 1908, both the Regulator Line and its competitor, the independent steamer Charles R. Spencer, cut their passenger ticket prices to $1 per person one-way from Portland to either Astoria or The Dalles. Previously the rates had been $1.50, and Capt. Ernest W. Spencer, master of the steamer Spencer, was willing to see the rate cut to 50 cents. Proposed return to Astoria run In mid-May 1908, there was talk that Bailey Gatzert might be placed on the run from Portland to Megler, Washington, where the Union Pacific Railroad had recently completed a big new dock to allow better river steamer connections, chiefly by the U.P.'s T.J.Potter, to be made between the narrow-gauge rail line running to Ilwaco and points on the Long Beach Peninsula. There was expected to be a sharp contest for the summer business on the Portland-Megler run. With automobile traffic little developed, and with no good roads to the resorts on the peninsula, then popular with Portland residents, steamer access was critical. A new dock at Megler, possibly the largest on the Columbia, was built out far enough into the river that steamers could call there at any time without having to wait for a favorable high tide, as had been the case with the previous landing at Ilwaco. The Union Pacific however, which had previously cooperated with the Regulator line, permitting interchangeable tickets between the two companies, now refused to allow the Regulator boats, including the Gatzert, to use the Megler dock. High water on the Columbia In June 1908, high water on the Columbia, reaching 37.1 feet above low water on June 18, 1908, forced closure of the Cascades Locks and suspension, temporarily, of river steamer service to The Dalles. Call for an end to steamboat racing On Monday, June 22, 1908, the Gatzert and Spencer, both under full steam, raced past the British ship Crown of India. The swell created by the steamers nearly caused the ship to break free from its moorings. Captain Gilbert of the Crown of India made a complaint to the port engineer, J.B.C. Lockwood, who said that measures would have to be taken to prevent steamboat racing, as it was only a matter of time until a ship or the dry dock would be damaged. Gilbert's complaint was discussed at a special meeting of the Port of Portland held on the afternoon of Thursday, June 25, 1908. On July 1, 1908, five steamers, Bailey Gatzert, Charles R. Spencer, Dalles City, Joseph Kellogg, and Capital City all departed Portland at 7:00 a.m., and nearly collided as they tried to pass through the draw of the Burnside Bridge. On July 4, 1908 all steamers operating out of Portland were crowded to their limit. The full legal limit of 625 persons boarded Bailey Gatzert, after which customs officials ordered the gang planks drawn in, leaving on the dock over 1,000 who had wanted to board. Accidents and casualties At 12:40 a.m. on Wednesday, October 30, 1895, in very dense fog, Bailey Gatzert collided with T.J. Potter, just downriver from Kalama, Washington, near Coffin Rock. No lives were lost. Damage to the Gatzert was $200, and damage to the Potter was $50. On December 29, 1897, Bailey Gatzert was approaching Portland from Astoria and passing through the draw of the swinging railroad bridge. With 60 passengers on board, the steamer blew the whistle signal to open the bridge, and when the draw swung open, the vessel proceeded through on the east side of the bridge pier. Before the steamer was halfway through, the drawbridge swung back, smashing into the vessel's superstructure and jamming the steamer up against the bridge. It was late in the evening, and except for the crew, everyone on board was asleep. The bridge was opened again, and the steamer was able to proceed. Although some cabins were crushed, there were no fatalities and only two people were hurt, neither of them seriously. At the time, Bailey Gatzert was valued at $110,000. Early in the morning of July 5, 1900, a large fire consumed about one-half of the business district in Rainier, Oregon. The Bailey Gatzert arrived at the town during the fire, and turned the steamer's firehose on the water front area, which was credited with saving the dock, warehouses, and other buildings in that vicinity. On Friday, June 26, 1903, the cook of the Bailey Gatzert, a Chinese-American, was reported to have slipped from the gangplank of the steamer while docked at Portland, fell into the river, and drowned, within sight of 50 persons. On November 1, 1907, at about 10:15 a.m. en route to The Dalles, at about Washougal, Washington, the Gatzert struck the upper end of Ough Reef, breaking some of the hull planking. The Gatzert was beached, a temporary patch put on the hole, and then returned to Portland, where the vessel was hauled out into drydock for repairs. No one was injured, there was no damage to the cargo, and the estimated cost of repair was $400. Steamboat inspectors conducted an investigation on November 4, 1907, and found that the pilot on watch, J.C. Hastings was at fault, suspending his license for 30 days for negligence and unskillfulness. On recovery of his license, Captain Hastings was assigned to be senior deck officer on the Regulator Line's chartered freight carrying steamer, Weown, then running under Capt. W.P. Short. On November 6, 1907, at 8:00 a.m. in foggy conditions on the Willamette River, Bailey Gatzert collided with the dredge Portland, which was then at work on the river. There was no loss of life. The dredge was sunk, with an estimated damage of $10,000. A hole was torn in the bow of the Bailey Gatzert just above the water line. Damage to the steamer was estimated at $1,000. The Steamboat Inspection Service conducted an investigation from November 8, to December 3, which exonerated the master of the Gatzert from all blame. Last years on the Columbia River Postcard showing Bailey Gatzert at a landing on the Columbia River. The decade beginning in 1911 was the last of the great steamboat era on the Columbia River. During this time, Bailey Gatzert ran mostly on excursions up the Columbia Gorge through the Cascade Locks and to The Dalles, as part of The Dalles, Portland and Astoria Navigation Company, also known as the Regulator Line. The Regulator Line was controlled by the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway, which was also known as the North Bank road. In January 1911, Bailey Gatzert was out of operation for the winter. In April 1911, a competitor of the Regulator Line, the Open River Transportation Company, running the sternwheeler J.N. Teal, cut its fare from Portland to The Dalles from $1.00 to 50 cents. In response, the Regulator Line stated that it would match superior service and speed, and moved to a faster schedule with its two boats, Gatzert and Dalles City. By the summer of 1915, the major part of the passenger steamer service out of Portland was being provided by only four vessels: the Georgiana to Astoria, Bailey Gatzert on excursions to Columbia River Gorge, Grahamona to Oregon City, and, to St. Helens via Willamette Slough, the smaller propeller-driven steamer America America was built in 1899 at Portland, Oregon, and was 99 gross tons, 93.9 feet long. On the night of May 17, 1917, Bailey Gatzert, which had been out of service for some time, returned to the Portland-The Dalles Route. On June 20, 1917, when high water forced the closing of the Cascade Locks, the Gatzert, under veteran Captain Archie Geer (1859-1919), ran through the rapids with 125 passengers on board. This was the first time that passengers had been carried through the Cascades Rapids and the first time that the rapids had been run by any steamboat since June 26, 1893, when the D.S. Baker was brought through. The river was then at 32.1 feet above low water, the highest it had apparently ever been during a steamboat run. The lowest water over the rapids during a steamboat run, 13.2 feet, had been on June 15, 1889, when Wasco had been taken over by Capt. James W. Troup. In June 1917, Bailey Gatzert was the only steamer making regular runs from Portland to The Dalles, and these runs were subject to interruption when high water closed the Cascades Locks. = Sympathy strike= On August 6, 1917, the Marine Transport Workers Industrial Union No. 700, which was affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World, called for a strike of deckhands on steamers operating on the Columbia and Willamette Rivers, to show sympathy for lumber worker strikes then ongoing at mills and logging camps. Most of the deckhands of five steamers went out on strike. Of the eight deckhands on Bailey Gatzert, three or four non-union hands remained on duty. =Removed from service= At the end of December, 1917, the Gatzert was taken out of service for the winter. On February 26, 1918, the Regulator Line, owners of the Bailey Gatzert, announced through Drake C. O'Reilly, head of the corporation, that it would not be resuming service from Portland to The Dalles. The company cited increased labor costs, and the increased price of fuel oil, which had risen from 75 cents to $1.65 per barrel, as causes of its decision, which idled the steamers Gatzert and Dalles City, with the company having no plans for either vessel. This left the steamer Tahoma, under the People's Line, running from Portland to The Dalles three times a week. Return to Puget Sound On April 10, 1918, the Gatzert was purchased by a shipping line known as The Navy Yard Route, an affiliate of the dominant Puget Sound Navigation Company, and placed on the run between Seattle and Bremerton, Washington. Well-known Seattle businessman Joshua Green (1869-1975) acted as the Navy Yard's representative in the sale. There was a heavy demand for passenger ferry service due to wartime activity at the navy yards at Bremerton. En route to Seattle, Bailey Gatzert arrived at Astoria on April 14, 1918, at 1:00 a.m. Bailey Gatzert departed across the Columbia Bar at 6:40 a.m. on April 17, 1918, bound for Puget Sound in the tow of the steam tug Wallula. In 1920, Bailey Gatzert was \\"sponsoned out\\" (widened), to work as an automobile ferry, and an automobile elevator was installed on the main deck forward of the pilot house. At this time, the captain of the vessel was Harry Anderson, later to be in charge of the Washington State Ferry System. In November 1921, Bailey Gatzert was replaced on the Bremerton route by the converted steam ferry City of Bremerton (ex Whatcom ex Majestic). The four- toned whistle was also transferred to the City of Bremerton. In 1923 the Gatzerts boiler was retubed. According to one source, Bailey Gatzerts last active service was in the summer of 1923, substituting for City of Bremerton while that ferry was being overhauled. According to another source, Bailey Gatzert was still in occasional use in October 1925. The boat's hull was then 194 feet long, and the overall length of the vessel was 225 feet. The stern- wheel was then 22 feet in diameter and it made 20 revolutions in a minute. Disposition According to one source, the machinery in the Gatzert was stripped out in 1926 Another, contemporary, source, reports that the boat was floating at its moorings in May 1929, stripped of machinery and out of use. In 1930, the hulk of the steamer was sold to the Lake Union Drydock and Machine Works, of Seattle, which built a four-story structure on the old hull, which was still sound, and used the vessel as a floating shipway and machine shop in Lake Union. Modern memory The Gatzert's chime whistle and its name plate were preserved in the collections of the Museum of History and Industry, in Seattle, Washington. The design of the Bailey Gatzert inspired several other sternwheelers, including the 1897 Arrow Lakes, British Columbia sternwheeler Rossland and, much later, the M/V Columbia Gorge, launched at Hood River, Oregon in 1983. Rossland, said to have been one of the most elegant steamboats ever built, was designed by Captain James W. Troup, the same man who had been on board Bailey Gatzert when it was launched in 1890. In 1996, the Bailey Gatzert was honored by being depicted on a U.S. postage stamp. In 2013, the Gorge Winds Concert Band recorded \\"The Bailey Gatzert March\\", in an arrangement by Steve Hodges.

It was released as the third song on the track-listing of West's 2007 mixtape Can't Tell Me Nothing. The song was produced by Fiasco and contains samples of the recording \\"The Eraser\\" by Thom Yorke, lead singer of the alternative rock band Radiohead. On \\"Us Placers,\\" the trio speak on the entrapments of fame. Having been released on a free mixtape, the song did not enter charts but became an online hit and received strong reviews from music critics. Background \\"Us Placers\\" was produced by Lupe Fiasco, who initially crafted the song for inclusion within his own mixtape. His intention was to create a mashup mixtape of the same name, a hip- hop remake of English alternative rock musician Thom Yorke's 2006 solo album The Eraser, along with a few Radiohead songs. Fiasco originally wanted Kanye West, who also deeply enjoyed Yorke's album, and English hip-hop group the Streets to appear on the track. However, the Streets failed to respond while West sent the song over to Pharrell Williams after laying down a verse. The three enjoyed the collaboration so much that they decided to form their very own group. It was Williams who came up with their name, Child Rebel Soldier. According to Fiasco, \\"It was Pharrell's idea one day in the studio 'cause we're all similar, same likes and same dislikes, same goals and aspirations.\\" Early track listings for West's third studio album Graduation indicated that he intended to feature the group's song on his album, but it was subsequently not included. Composition  \\"Us Placers\\" is an up-tempo hip-hop song. It is set in the time signature of common time with a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute. The song contains samples of \\"The Eraser\\" by Thom Yorke, incorporating the song's piano loops and a portion of Yorke's vocals for its chorus. It begins with a medium tempo followed by a hesitant piano melody, with Fiasco uttering, \\"Yeah, just a lil' bit, just a lil' bit. And it goes...\\" Fiasco, West and Williams, listed in order of appearance, then rap the song's three verses over a sparse, pulsating beat. Each verse is organized around a chorus that is provided by the melodic vocal sample. The chorus is coupled with a harmonic hook delivered by Fiasco, whose vocals implement overdubbing. During the chorus, the song's chord progression changes to and takes on a more moody, atmospheric sound. The song ends with an echoing reiteration of its piano keys. Lyrically, \\"Us Placers\\" is a meditation on the perils of fame. Fiasco's verse depicts the over-indulgent lifestyles of rich and famous celebrities. In a stoic voice, he rapidly raps an extensive list of materialistic possessions, including a large mansion, a wardrobe full of exorbitant clothes, Mexican floral arrangers, a big-screen television, and a fifty-foot yacht. Fiasco brings his verse to a close by making a declaration regarding the emptiness of opelence. West uses his verse to expound the ephemerality of fame. Citing aspiring participants of reality television programs such as The Real World and American Idol and internet celebrities as examples, he implies the fate of those who become instantly famous if only for a short time, in that once their fifteen minutes of fame are over, they then fade away into obscurity, possibly never to enter the public eye ever again. Williams takes a more stream-of-consciousness approach to his verse. He swiftly touches on a series of social issues ranging from greenhouse gases, drug dealers, the will God and troubled youth. Williams concludes his verse by exposing the motive behind the Virginia Tech shooting. He states the irony of the suicidal shooter, in that he finally achieved the fame and recognition he sought in life, but is not alive to see it. After each verse, Yorke's melodious vocals sing a mournful yet defiant chorus that complements the song's concept of the sisyphean pursuit of fame: \\"The more you try to erase me, the more that I appear.\\" Critical reception \\"Us Placers\\" received overwhelmingly positive reviews from music critics and was widely regarded as the highlight of the Can't Tell Me Nothing mixtape. Rolling Stone not only cited the song as the best track on the mixtape but also placed it at number forty-three on their list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007. Complimenting the poignant use of the sample as well as the depth of the trio's individual verses, it wrote, \\"Each brings something wholly new to the other, trading self-effacement and self-possession back and forth until there's no difference between the two. For this 3:53, hip-hop isn't dead, and neither is rock. They're quietly invincible.\\" Thomas Inskeep of Stylus Magazine described \\"Us Placers\\" as being both deep and intelligent and praised the dexterity of Williams' verse in particular. Toronto Star columnist John Sakamoto wrote that the recording was a \\"stunning collaboration.\\" Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune stated that the song was brilliant while Entertainment Weekly called it an \\"instant Internet classic.\\" Luke Lewis of Q Magazine felt it was a shame that \\"Us Placers\\" would not be featured on Fiasco's then-forthcoming sophomore album, Lupe Fiasco's The Cool, as he believed that the song's guest appearances and lyrical content \\"all adds up to the most atmospheric, and quietly enthralling, hip-hop track we've heard in a long time.\\" Two years later, while reviewing his Enemy of the State: A Love Story mixtape, Allison Stewart from The Washington Post retrospectively referred to \\"Us Placers\\" as \\"the great '07 track\\" and commended Fiasco's production of the song.\\" At About.com, \\"Us Placers\\" was placed at number thirty-two on their list of the Top 100 Rap Songs of 2007 and later at number eighty-three on their 100 Best Rap Songs of the 2000s. Music video Though no official music video for \\"Us Placers\\" was released, a non-commissioned video was produced by music video director Va$htie. The video features then-ten-year-old child impersonators standing in for Fiasco, West, Williams and Yorke. They lip-sync to and illustrate the song's lyrics and hold up cue cards in reference to Bob Dylan's \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\". Despite its \\"zero-budget,\\" unofficial nature, the music video was very well received, garnering well over two million views on YouTube alone. It has since gone on to have caught the attention of West, who expressed his affinity by posting the video up on his official blog. Live performances Fiasco performed \\"Us Placers\\" on August 5, 2007 during his set at Lollapalooza, to the delight of the largely alternative rock audience.

He took up boxing as early as seven or eight by some accounts to counter the effects of Polio which he had suffered from as a young child. Baby used a charging, bruising style, making him a very strong two- fisted fighter. He began boxing professionally at age 13. He took his first championship, the Mexican bantamweight title at only eighteen, a twelve round points decision against Kid Poncho in Mexico City. With victories over flyweight champion Fidel LaBarba, Baby established himself as a worthy contender for the featherweight crown. On September 16, 1932, at the age of 19, he defeated reigning NBA world featherweight champion Tommy Paul in a close ten round non-title fight, dropping him in the second and fourth rounds. After his win, Arizmendi requested the National Boxing Association (NBA) recognize his status as champion.

Arizmendi nearly toppled Brown with a left hook in the third, but slowed his pace some in the fourth through seventh when Brown countered with short lefts, and rights to the body. He retained his title with a draw against Varias Milling, then defended it against seasoned contenders Archie Bell and Speedy Dado. He first defeated Bell in ten round points decision at Legion Stadium in Hollywood on December 2, 1932. The California sanctioned title match before a capacity crowd saw Arizmendi close strongly in the last two rounds to take a convincing lead on points. Arizmendi was awarded six rounds, Bell two including the eighth when he landed some solid punches, and two were even. Bell was down for a no count in the second, and was dropped to his knees in the fourth.\\"Bell Whipped By Arizmendi\\", The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, pg. 5, 3 December 1932\\"Archie Bell Beaten By Baby Arizmendi\\", The San Bernardino County Sun, San Bernardino, California, pg. 15, 3 December 1932 In his January 6, 1933 California sanctioned World featherweight title rematch with Bell in San Francisco, Arizmendi won in a ten round points decision. Arizmendi opened up in the sixth, and rained a steady blow of punches in the remaining rounds to take a clear points margin. Bell may have held an edge in the first five rounds, with the exception of the third. He withstood the blows of Arizmendi in the final rounds and remained on his feet throughout.\\"Arizmendi Defeats Bell By Decision\\", The Bakersfield Californian, Bakersfield, California, pg. 9, 7 January 1933 In his last successful defense of the California-sanctioned world featherweight champion, Arizmendi defeated Speedy Dado in a ten round points decision in Los Angeles on January 24, 1933. Losing the California sanctioned world featherweight title, February, 1933 He lost the California version of the title to NBA World featherweight champion Freddie Miller on February 28, 1933 in a 10-round unification bout in Los Angeles. Miller took seven rounds, with one even, and two to Arizmendi. With a lightning right jab that landed repeatedly and a good left hook, Miller kept the Mexican champion at bay. Arizmendi performed best in the seventh where he rushed Miller to the ropes and bloodied his nose with hard rights to head and chin.\\"Hail of Bottles Climax of Featherweight Bout\\", The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, pg. 23, 1 March 1933 The packed house containing many former Mexican fans, turned against Arizmendi, booing him and throwing bottles into the ring at the close of the match. Arizmendi persevered, and later that year defeated Miller in a non-title fight. =Taking the NYSAC world featherweight crown, August, 1934= On August 30, 1934, he defeated Mike Belloise for the New York state (NYSAC) world featherweight crown, leaving no doubt as to his claim to the championship. After the win, Arizmendi attempted to secure a third fight with NBA champion Miller in a title bout, however, Miller refused to face him. Arizmendi's failure to take the NBA version of the featherweight title affected his legacy, despite his taking both the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC), and Mexico-California version of the world featherweight titles in his career. Armstrong In Mexico City on November 4, 1934, he defeated Henry Armstrong in their first of five meetings, winning almost every round despite suffering a broken wrist in the second, and by some accounts taking claim of the California-Mexican World featherweight title. He defeated Armstrong once again on January 1, 1935, in a twelve round unanimous decision in Mexico City. Following those victories, he defeated future world title holder Chalky Wright by fourth round knockout. On February 7, 1936, he lost to future lightweight champion Lou Ambers in a ten round unanimous decision, with Ambers taking every round, by one account. Arizmendi, however fought well for the first five rounds, but was unable to continue the pace in the remaining portion of the match. Ambers got his range with his punishing left in the fourth, fifth, and sixth. In the eighth, Arizmendi suffered a bleeding cut near his right eye, helping Ambers to increase his points margin in the final two rounds.\\"Lou Ambers Winner Over Arizmendi\\", The Evening News, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, pg. 11, 8 February 1936 The bout was not billed as a title fight. Losing the California-Mexico sanctioned featherweight title, August, 1936 Arizmendi subsequently lost the California-Mexico World title in his third bout with Armstrong on August 4, 1936 at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles. In his following 7 fights, Arizmendi combined wins and losses before facing Armstrong for a fourth and final time on March 15, 1938 in Los Angeles. Despite losing the ten round fight on points, Arizmendi ended Armstrong's 27 fight knockout streak by going the distance with him. In his following 6 fights, Arizmendi won five and had a ten round draw against reigning world lightweight champion Lou Ambers on June 7, 1938 in Los Angeles. =Attempt at the world welterweight crown, January 1939= In his last bout with Armstrong and his last attempt at a world title, he dropped a grueling 10-round points decision before 10,500 fans for the world welterweight championship on January 10, 1939 at Los Angeles' Olympic Stadium. The match was ten rounds of continuous and largely close in fighting, and though admitting he put up a valiant effort, the Los Angeles Times could only award the fourth round to the badly bruised and bleeding Arizmendi. Armstrong characteristically crowded and threw continuous blows which included some fouls, but typical of his style, demonstrated neither elegant technique, nor graceful ring craft.Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, pg. 33, 11 January 1939 He continued boxing until 1942, obtaining bouts with boxing standouts Lou Ambers, Sammy Angott, and George Latka, but never again went for a title. Arizmendi faced Lou Ambers on February 24, 1939, losing in an eleventh round technical knockout in Madison Square Garden before a disappointing crowd of 8,837. A physician examining Arizmendi's eyes believed the gashes he had received during the bout were too serious to allow him to continue the bout. Arizmendi had completed all his previous bouts. Ambers, hoping to obtain another shot at the title, had fought viciously through the bout.\\"Ambers Stops Baby Arizmendi\\", Pottsville Republican, Pottsville, Pennsylvania, pg. 10, 25 February 1939 He had drawn with Ambers on June 7, 1938 at Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles, California. In one of his best performances against a reigning champion, one reporter gave four rounds to Ambers, as many as four to Arizmendi, and three even. Overcoming a 1-3 odds deficit, Arizmendi may have nearly dropped Ambers in the second with a right cross.Singer, Jack, \\"Arizmendi, Ambers Draw\\", Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, pg. 20, 8 June 1938 After retiring from boxing, Arizmendi served in the U.S. Navy during World War II, and later operated restaurants in the Echo Park District of Los Angeles. He was hospitalized in July, 1956, following a partial paralytic condition on his left side. According to his wife, Henrietta, he had been in poor health and lost fifty pounds the previous month. Death After a prolonged illness, Arizmendi died of natural causes in the Veterans Administration Hospital in Sawtelle, California, now part of the Los Angeles suburb Westwood, on New Year's Eve 1962, at the age of 48. He was survived by his wife Henrietta and an illegitimate son Raul Robert Arizmendi, born February, 1933 in Los Angeles.Available on Google News, \\"Arizmendi Dies\\", Nashua Telegraph, Nashua, New Hampshire, pg. 15, 2 January 1963 Arizmendi was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2004.

Synopsis The pair meet at a Hollywood party, where rugged leading man Gable eschews evening wear and screwball comedian Lombard arrives in an ambulance that wrecks his car. They argue. He threatens to spank her. She punches him on the jaw. The two clearly dislike each other, and intensely so, but as fate conspires to bring them together again and again, they begin to admire each other and fall in love. The fly in the ointment is Gable's second wife Ria. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio chief Louis B. Mayer fears any publicity about his affair with Lombard will jeopardize Gable's career, and since he is MGM's most valuable player, Mayer becomes protective of his star. Gable and Lombard fish, play practical jokes on each other, laugh, fight, and have fun making up. His wife finally grants him a divorce, and the two wed. The happily ever after ending is thwarted when Lombard is killed in a plane crash while promoting the purchase of defense bonds during World War II.

Founded in 1884, Wynberg Girls High School is one of the oldest all-girls schools in South Africa. The first headmistress, Miss Margaret Stewart, was supported by two teachers and catered to 27 pupils. Initially a co-educational school, WGHS soon became an all-girls school and was known as Ladies' Seminary. WGHS is part of the Wynberg Campus of schools, along with Wynberg Girls' Junior School, Wynberg Boys' Junior School, and Wynberg Boys' High School. The school is located in Aliwal Road in the suburb of Wynberg. School activities at Wynberg are founded on four pillars: Academics, Sport, Service and Culture. The school has excelled in all four of these areas and has subsequently produced well-rounded pupils capable of entering a wide variety of careers. The school motto is Honour before Honours, which means: personal integrity and character are more important than winning prizes and awards. History =1895-1908= In September 1884 the Kerkraad of the Dutch Reformed Church, situated on the top of Carr Hill, decided to found a school for girls in Wynberg. Wynberg at this time was a little village on the wagon road from Cape Town. It was situated near the Military camp and surrounded by Little Chelsea with its cottages and narrow winding streets. The minister of the Dutch Reformed Church at that time lived in the old Pastorie where the boarding house is situated today. The church council decided to build a little school building (where the school library is today) and named the school \\"Ladies' Seminary\\" - it was soon nicknamed the \\"School in the Bush.\\" The school was officially opened in 1885 with two teachers - Misses Annie Brink and Nellie Brink - and twenty-seven young boys and girls. The first principal was Miss Margaret Stewart (1885-1890) The school motto was chosen in 1890 - and the phrase Honour before Honours means \\"Personal integrity and character are more important than winning prizes and awards.\\" The first Standard Ten class matriculated in 1892, and until 1936, the school included pupils from Sub A to Standard Ten. The Cape Education department took over the running of the school in 1905. The first hostel was built in 1885, and was situated where the main hall is today. The new school was built in 1900, and had dormitories upstairs. The room now used as a staff workroom and offices for HOD's used to be a dormitory. Lab One was the kitchen, and the library was the dining room. The school at this time was called Girls' Public School. During this time Physical Education and Sport were introduced into the school. Wynberg was the first girls' school in South Africa to have a fully qualified Physical Education teacher, Mrs Dolly Rees who studied in London. A gymnasium was erected in 1900, and a hockey field was laid out where the Wellington Quad is today. Activities at school were hockey, cricket and tennis. =1909-1914= The first school hall was built during Miss A Chambers' time as principal, which is now the Ballet Hall. =Miss King, 1914-1936= Under the leadership of Miss King, a new building for the Junior School was built. The Peninsula Girls' Schools Games Union was formed and Inter-schools events became a feature of school life. Prefect and House systems were introduced and the school magazine was revived, and has been published every year since 1916. =Miss Hawkins= In 1936, the Junior School became a separate school. School colours of the time were navy and blue, until Miss Hawkins changed these back to the original colours of brown and gold. The school is built on part of the Waterloo Estate, originally owned by Captain William Underwood. He had fought under the Duke of Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo before coming to live in Wynberg. In 1938, a new hostel was built and Miss Hawkins named it Waterloo House, and asked the 5th Duke of Wellington if she could use an adapted version of his coat of arms as the new school badge. A new gymnasium was built, and opened in 1944, after the old building had suffered storm damage. =Miss A Currie= In 1958, the new school hall was opened. =Miss J Urie= In 1963, the school song was composed. In 1965, nine new classrooms were built. In 1968 four new tennis courts were built in Ellerslie Road. In 1969, the swimming pool was built entirely out of school funds and in 1970 the hockey field was grassed. The first tuck shop was opened behind the Ballet Hall, where the kitchen is today. The 7th Duke of Wellington visited our school in 1969, with the names of the houses being associated with him. In 1974, Ballet was introduced as a subject. In 1984, in time for the Centenary celebrations, 17 new classrooms were built on the old hockey field. =Mrs C Walters, 1988-1998= In 1988 a Parent Teacher Association was established for the first time, and matriculants were encouraged to become paid up members of the Wynberg Old Girls' Union. In 1993, the library was completely refurbished, a mezzanine floor put in and the library administrative area extended. A new tuck shop between the hall and the art room was built. From 1996-1998, significant technological developments were made, more television sets and video cassette recorders were bought. The new computer room was opened in 1997, with scanners, a digital camera and a digital projector. During 1997, the hostel and the hockey clubhouse were renovated. Wynberg became the first South African school to lay an AstroTurf. Computer Studies was introduced as an academic subject in 1998, and A-levels courses were offered either as a post matric course or as one which could be studied concurrently with Grades 11 and 12. =Mrs S Harding, 1999-2019= Mrs Harding become Principal in 1999. She established the computer room, with a strong commitment to making every learner computer literate. The Art Room and a large classroom teaching venue were opened in October 2002. The Life Skills wing was established catering for life skills classes, counsellors and the extensive social work and support programmes. Sporting Activities Wynberg Girls High offers a wide variety of team and social sports from which learners can choose. These include the standard sports such as hockey, indoor hockey, netball, tennis, cross country, athletics, swimming, diving, waterpolo and synchronised swimming. Beyond these sports, WGHS offers competitive chess. Participation is keen and, in general, play is of a very high standard, with many learners gaining provincial colours and several obtaining their national colours. Learners who do not participate in official school sports are given recognition for excellence in particular sports such as horse-riding and gymnastics. In the sporting arena, too, the learners of Wynberg Girls' High benefit from the unique circumstances of being able to share facilities with their brother and sister schools. Diving and swimming pools, an Astroturf, hockey fields, cricket nets and pitches, netball fields, squash and tennis courts are among the impressive facilities in the magnificent grounds of the combined schools. All Wynberg schools are encouraged to support each other in the various inter-schools events allowing learners to experience the benefit of a co-educational system, where they stand as one in supporting their teams. Cultural Activities As part of the extramural programme for those who are interested in the area of the performing arts and particularly those who are musically inclined there is an Orchestra, a Contemporary and Jazz Band, the Choir, a Junior and Senior Marimba band, Flute and Recorder Ensembles. For the budding Hollywood stars, orators, politicians and presidents of the future there are drama lessons, public speaking courses, weekly debating meetings/competitions and clashes. To keep students abreast of the world around them, there is flash debating in the weekly debates held during one of the breaks on the “Topic of the week.” For those wanting to stretch their creative writing abilities there is Between the Lines and for those interested in reporting and photographic journalism, there is the Web Committee, Photography Society as well as the Wynpress - the school newspaper for the students. Tending the spiritual needs and reaching out to the broader community are the Christian union of the school, Capstone and the Muslim Students’ Association. All of these clubs and societies come together in a number of very exciting annual cultural events on the school calendar. Each year there is a Major Production which is presented alternately at Wynberg Boys' and Wynberg Girls' High school, there are Interhouse Plays and there are several lunchtime and evening Music Concerts. Pupils also participate in regional events such as the Western Cape Arts Festival and Eisteddfods.

It is most suitable to remove stones of more than 2 cm in size and which are present near the pelvic region. It is usually done under general anesthesia or spinal anesthesia. __TOC__  Procedure A retrograde pyelogram is done to locate the stone in the kidney. With a small 1 centimeter incision in the loin, the percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCN) needle is passed into the pelvis of the kidney. The position of the needle is confirmed by fluoroscopy. A guide wire is passed through the needle into the pelvis. The needle is then withdrawn with the guide wire still inside the pelvis. Over the guide wire the dilators are passed and a working sheath is introduced. A nephroscope is then passed inside and small stones taken out. In case the stone is big it may first have to be crushed using ultrasound probes and then the stone fragments removed.Dr.Rajgopal Shenoy K (2006). Manipal Manual of Surgery - Second Edition, p.619. CBS Publishers & Distributors, New Delhi. The most difficult portion of the procedure is creating the tract between the kidney and the flank skin. Most of the time this is achieved by advancing a needle from the flank skin into the kidney, known as the 'antegrade' technique. A 'retrograde' technique has recently been updated wherein a thin wire is passed from inside the kidney to outside the flank with the aid of a flexible ureteroscope. This technique may reduce radiation exposure for patient and surgeon.

The village is on the River Dun, about east of Salisbury. History A Roman villa site straddles the present-day Wiltshire/Hampshire border. The village was mentioned in the Cartularium Saxonicum for the year 880 as (æt) Deone, and may have formed part of the inheritance of Aethelweard, youngest son of King Alfred. It is mentioned as Duene in the Domesday Book of 1086 (one of the 51 holdings of Waleran the Hunter), as Westdone in 1265, and as Westdune in 1270. Dean House, which straddles the border with Hampshire, is a Grade II* listed former rectory from the late 17th century, enlarged in the 18th. The Salisbury and Southampton Canal was opened through the parish in 1802 or 1803 but was never completed as far as Salisbury; it closed in 1806. The Wessex Main Line railway was built through the village in 1847, with Dean station where it crosses the road at a level crossing. The station is still in use. From 1941 to 2003, chalk caverns under Dean Hill to the south of the village were used as a Royal Naval Armaments Depot for munitions storage and maintenance. Religious sites Borbach Chantry was built in 1333. It has been designated as a Grade I listed building and is now in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The Anglican Church of St Mary was built in 1866 and is Grade II listed. A Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built c.1870 and closed in 1971.

He was the brother of Saint Aphian (or Amphianus). According to the martyrology, he publicly rebuked a judge who had been forcing Christian virgins to work in brothels in order to break them of their faith, so he was tortured and drowned. Life and martyrdom =Western tradition= The historian Eusebius of CaesareaThe Martyrs of Palestine (De Martyr. Pales.) ch. 5: \\"Aedesius, a brother of Apphianus, not only in God, but also in the flesh, being a son of the same earthly father, endured sufferings like his, after very many confessions and protracted tortures in bonds, and after he had been sentenced by the governor to the mines in Palestine. He conducted himself through them all in a truly philosophic manner; for he was more highly educated than his brother, and had prosecuted philosophic studies. Finally in the city of Alexandria, when he beheld the judge, who was trying the Christians, offending beyond all bounds, now insulting holy men in various ways, and again consigning women of greatest modesty and even religious virgins to procurers for shameful treatment, he acted like his brother. For as these things seemed insufferable, he went forward with bold resolve, and with his words and deeds overwhelmed the judge with shame and disgrace. After suffering in consequence many forms of torture, he endured a death similar to his brother's, being cast into the sea.\\" elaborates Aedesius' story: like his brother, he was a philosopher that converted to Christianity. Perhaps because of his standing among the educated, he seems to have thought little of professing his faith before magistrates, for which he was imprisoned several times and was sentenced to work in the mines of Palestine. He sought solitude in Egypt after his release, but found the persecution there was harsher under Hierocles. Aedesius was offended by the enslavement of consecrated virgins (who were forced to work in brothels), and so presented himself before the governor, whereupon he was seized by soldiers, tortured, and drowned. The saint's acta are preserved in a Chaldaic text. This story is probably confused, and perhaps conflated with that of the contemporary Neoplatonist philosopher, Aedesius. =Eastern tradition= The account of the Eastern Church says Aedesius and his brother were born in Patara of high-standing pagan parents. The brothers converted while studying in Beirut, secretly fleeing to Caesarea to be taught by a priest named Pamphylus. It is reported that Amphianus gave himself up to martyrdom, having \\"a twenty-year-old body but the understanding and greatness of soul of a centenarian.\\" Having tried to stop the pagan governor of the area from sacrificing to idols, he was tortured; his legs were wrapped in cotton and burned, and they threw him into the sea with a stone around his neck. Aedesius was punished by being sent to a copper mine in Palestine, and then to Egypt. In Alexandria, he spoke out against Hierocles, who had been forcing Christian \\"nuns, virgins and pious women\\" to work alongside prostitutes in brothels. The account says Aedesius struck the prince, for which he was tortured and drowned in the sea like his brother. Veneration Aedesius' feast day is celebrated on 8 April in the Roman Catholic Church. In Eastern Orthodox Churches, his feast is 2 April. In art, Aedesius is shown shipwrecked with his brother; the mention of a depiction that has his legs wrapped in oiled linen before he is burned to death is probably a reflection of the Eastern story of his brother's martyrdom.

Essentially, a BSS machine is a Random Access Machine with registers that can store arbitrary real numbers and that can compute rational functions over reals in a single time step. It is often referred to as Real RAM model. BSS machines are more powerful than Turing machines, because the latter are by definition restricted to a finite alphabet. A Turing machine can be empowered to store arbitrary rational numbers in a single tape symbol by making that finite alphabet arbitrarily large (in terms of a physical machine using transistor-based memory, building its memory locations of enough transistors to store the desired number), but this does not extend to the uncountable real numbers (for example, no number of transistors can accurately represent Pi). Definition A BSS machine M is given by a list Iof N+1 instructions (to be described below), indexed 0, 1, \\\\dots, N. A configuration of M is a tuple (k,r,w,x), where k is the index of the instruction to be executed next, r and w are copy registers holding non-negative integers, and x=(x_0,x_1,\\\\ldots) is a list of real numbers, with all but finitely many being zero. The list x is thought of as holding the contents of all registers of M. The computation begins with configuration (0,0,0,x) and ends whenever k=N; the final content of x is said to be the output of the machine. The instructions of M can be of the following types: *Computation(x_{0}): a substitution x_{0} := g_{k}(x) is performed, where g_{k} is an arbitrary rational function (a quotient of two polynomial functions with arbitrary real coefficients); copy registers r and w may be changed, either by r := 0 or r := r + 1 and similarly for w. The next instruction is k+1. *Branch(x_{0}, l): if x_{0} \\\\geq 0 then goto l; else goto k+1. *Copy(x_{r}, x_{w}): the content of the \\"read\\" register x_{r} is copied into the \\"write\\" register x_{w}; the next instruction is k+1 See also *Hypercomputation *Real computer *Real RAM Further reading  Category:Models of computation ","title":"Blum–Shub–Smale machine"},{"id":"14988364","text":"The 1994 Hopman Cup was the sixth edition of the Hopman Cup that was held at the Burswood Entertainment Complex, in Perth, Western Australia.

Life and career Born in Linz, Austria, Jeannette Aster was brought up and educated in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Trained initially as a classical dancer, she obtained her BMus in Voice Performance from McGill University before going on to study Opera Production at the London Opera Centre in London, England. After serving 5 years as a staff director in the Netherlands Opera, Hamburg State Opera and the Deutsche Oper Berlin, Aster made her Canadian debut as stage director in 1977 at the National Arts Centre Festival in Ottawa with Mozart's Magic Flute, returning the following season to direct Cosi fan tutte. She began working with the Canadian Opera Company in 1972. In 1979 together with General Director Lotfi Mansouri, and his associate John Leberg, she helped found the COC Ensemble (Young Artist programme) and in 1980 became its first resident director. In 1986, at the invitation of Peter Hemmings, she joined the newly formed Los Angeles Music Center Opera as a founding Associate Director and resident stage director. From 1988 to 1998 Aster was Artistic Director of Opera Lyra Ottawa. In addition to presenting mainstage opera productions at the National Arts Centre, Aster commissioned 3 new operas, instituted a comprehensive training programme which included a boys' choir, teen chorus and Associate Artist Studio, and community-based education projects for adults and young people.Norman, Barbara and Ware, Evan (2008). \\"Opera Lyra Ottawa\\".

It allows movement of proteins through this barrier and into the intermembrane space of the mitochondrion. Most of the proteins needed for mitochondrial function are encoded by the nucleus of the cell. The outer membrane of the mitochondrion is impermeable to large molecules greater than 5000 Daltons. The TOM works in conjunction with the translocase of the inner membrane (TIM) to translocate proteins into the mitochondrion. Many of the proteins in the TOM complex, such as TOMM22, were first identified in Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The complete mitochondrial protein translocase complex includes at least 19 proteins: several chaperones, four proteins of the outer membrane translocase (Tom) import receptor, five proteins of the Tom channel complex, five proteins of the inner membrane translocase (Tim) and three \\"motor\\" proteins. Protein targeting to the mitochondria There are various mitochondrial import pathways that exist to facilitate the import of precursor proteins to their destined mitochondrial subcompartments. HSP90 aids the delivery of the mitochondrial preprotein to the TOM complex in an ATP- dependent process. Many precursor proteins (those that are destined for the matrix) contain amino-terminal presequences that carry information required for the targeting of proteins to the mitochondrial matrix These matrix targeting signals generally contain 10-80 amino acid residues that take on the conformation of an amphipathic-α helix and contain one positive and hydrophobic face. Once the precursor reaches the matrix, the presequence is typically cleaved off by the matrix processing peptidase. Proteins targeted to other sub-compartments of the mitochondria such as the intermembrane space and inner mitochondrial membrane, contain internal targeting signals, these signals have an indefinable nature and are inconsistent in their pattern. Proteins targeted to the outer membrane also contain internal targeting signals, not all of which have been identified, and include proteins that take on a β-barrel structure, such as Tom40. Some proteins however, that are targeted to the outer mitochondrial membrane contain a hydrophobic tail domain that anchors the protein to the membrane. Members of the complex The translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) forms a complex made of Tom70, Tom22, and Tom20, along with Tom40, Tom7, Tom6, and Tom5. Tom20 and Tom22 are preprotein receptors, which are responsible for recognition of the cleavable presequence possessed by mitochondrial-targeted proteins. Tom70 is also a preprotein receptor and may recognise some cleavable presequence proteins, however it is mainly responsible for the recognition of non-cleavable preproteins and acts as a point for chaperone binding. Tom22 is anchored to the outer membrane by a single transmembrane segment and also plays a role in stabilizing the TOM complex. Tom40 is the core element of the translocase complex and complexes with Tom22 with a mass of approximately 350k Daltons. It forms the central protein-conducting channel with a diameter of approximately 2.5 nm. The human Tom22 is approximately 15.5k Daltons and complexes with Tom20. The N-terminal end of Tom22 extends into the cytosol and is involved in preprotein binding.

He played his entire, but brief career for the Seattle Mariners (1998–99). He is a graduate of Joseph Wheeler High School in Marietta, Georgia and attended Clemson University. Monahan now lives in South Carolina. Monahan has been known to be a “hothead” by a number of his peers. Often lashing out unnecessarily in dire situations. Monahan comes from a family that is well known in the National Hockey League. Monahan's father is Hartland Monahan, his grandfather was Bernie Geoffrion, a Hall of Famer who is credited with inventing the slap shot in hockey, and his great-grandfather was NHL Hall of Famer Howie Morenz. He is the nephew of Danny Geoffrion and cousin of Blake Geoffrion. Collegiate Baseball career While at Clemson University, Monahan broke several school and Atlantic Coast Conference records, some of which he still holds, including game appearances, at bats, and hits. Monahan appeared in every Clemson game during his 3 years at the school (1993–1995). In the 1994 season, Monahan led the NCAA in hits (137) and runs (97). His 137-hit season remains an ACC record. Also in 1994, Monahan set ACC single-season records of 330 at bats and 75 game appearances. He is one of only 5 Clemson Tigers to hit for the cycle, doing so in Hawai'i against Hawai'i-Hilo on March 19, 1994. He was ACC Player of the Week twice in 1994, and the ACC Tournament MVP. He was named to the All-ACC Tournament team in 1994 and 1995. In 1993, along with teammate Scott Winchester, Monahan was a Freshman All-American; in the 1994 and 1995 seasons, Monahan was a two-time All-American in the ABCA, Baseball America, Collegiate Baseball, and NCBWA polls. In 1993, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox. Monahan was a 3-time Letterman at Clemson, and was inducted into the Clemson Athletic Hall of Fame in 2011. Professional Baseball career Monahan was picked by the Atlanta Braves in 18th Round of 1992 amateur entry draft, but chose to attend Clemson University instead. He was next selected in the second round by the Seattle Mariners in the amateur entry draft. From 1995 through , Monahan played on minor league affiliates of the Mariners. Between and , he split the seasons between the Mariners and the Tacoma Rainiers. After the 1999 season, Monahan returned to the minors and between 1999 and he played for minor league affiliates of the Mariners, Cincinnati Reds, San Diego Padres, Colorado Rockies, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Kansas City Royals. Monahan ended his professional career in playing for the independent Atlantic City Surf of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. Admission of drug use On December 28, 2007, Monahan admitted in an interview with ESPN that he used the anabolic steroids Deca-Durabolin and Winstrol as well as amphetamines during his playing career. Monahan stated that he started using steroids in 1998, partly because of what he states was widespread use in the Mariners clubhouse. During the time he played with the Mariners, he played with players who were mentioned in the Mitchell Report, including Ryan Franklin, Glenallen Hill, David Segui and Todd Williams. Three players have since come out to refute Monahan's comments regarding the Mariner clubhouse atmosphere. Raúl Ibañez stated: > It's amazing to me that a guy like Shane—a guy who was up and down at best > and had a very limited cup of coffee with us—would be able to know what was > going on. I was up and down like he was. I was in that same boat that he was > in, and everyone makes their choice. In 10 years, I've never seen a person > take a steroid. Jamie Moyer stated: > I can tell you that I was there for 10 years and I never saw anyone take > steroids. This will be my 20th year in the major leagues, and I don't even > know what a steroid looks like. If I have to start relying on those things, > after so many years in the game, then it's time to pack it in. That's the > way I look at things. Edgar Martínez, like former teammates Raúl Ibañez and Jamie Moyer, denied allegations of such use in the clubhouse.

The station opened on 18 December 1883, as the terminus of the Swindon and Cheltenham Extension Railway line from Swindon Town. That line then amalgamated with the Swindon, Marlborough and Andover Railway to form the M&SWJR.; Cirencester became a through-station in 1891, with the opening of the northern extension of the line between Cirencester and the junction at Andoversford with the Great Western Railway (GWR)'s Cheltenham Lansdown to Banbury line, which had opened in 1881. Cirencester was the biggest station on this section of the line; it was home to the M&SWJR;'s locomotive and wagon workshops, and a large goods yard. There was also a huge water tank, atop a stone building on the up platform, which supplied water that was loaded into rail-mounted tankers and taken to the stone-crushing plant at Foss Cross, the next station to the north. Despite the size of the station, Cirencester Watermoor never achieved the passenger or goods traffic that was attracted by the Great Western station in the town, Cirencester Town, and its status was further diminished when, following the Grouping of 1923, the M&SWJR; line was allocated to the GWR, which promptly closed the workshops. The station was named \\"Cirencester Watermoor\\" from 1924 to distinguish it from the other station. Passenger and goods traffic on the M&SWJR; fell steeply after the Second World War and the line closed to passengers in 1961, with goods facilities being withdrawn in March 1964.

The \\"People's Voice\\" awards, chosen by online poll, received 100,000 cumulative votes that year. The 1998 awards were sponsored by PC World Communications, the San Francisco Chronicle and other organizations. ABC News was the official website to \\"cybercast\\" the awards. The Web magazine, which was hosting the awards, was closed down by its parent company IDG shortly before the awards, and the ceremony continued thereafter under the management of Tiffany Shlain, who IDG had hired in 1996 to coordinate the awards.

That year, Mayor Rudy Giuliani lobbied to move the ceremony to New York City, but San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown convinced the organization to remain in San Francisco by promising city support. Brown gave a speech at the ceremony and Marc Maron was the master of ceremonies. The event was noted for the famous incident in which a representative of Jodi.org, which had won in the arts category, called the event participants \\"Ugly corporate sons-of-bitches\\" in his acceptance speech and tossed his trophy to the audience.

She was played by Sunetra Sarker. Nisha first appeared in 1988, working alongside Sammy Rogers (Rachael Lindsay) at a local supermarket after school - a job she had taken without the knowledge of her strict family, who believed she was using the time to study at the library. Their friendship grew when a strike at the supermarket's wholesalers meant they had no work, and so they both returned to Sammy's house to listen to music. A significant ongoing storyline for Nisha, Sammy and Owen Daniels (Danny McCall) came in the summer of 1989, when, following a night out with a group of friends, they were involved in a serious car accident which killed the driver of their car (a young man whom one of their friends had just met in a nightclub). At the inquest some months later, it emerged that all the girls except Sammy had been somewhat economical with the truth in order to spare the feelings of the deceased's parents. This, coupled with Nisha's progress in her studies (while Sammy found herself struggling academically) led to the girls drifting apart, and the character was gradually seen less and less in the series. Nisha re-appeared in the show almost ten years later and began working as a nurse. Her biggest storylines in her final years on the programme involved affairs with Jerome Johnson (Leon Lopez) much to the annoyance of Nikki Shadwick (Suzanne Collins) in 2002 and Gary Parr (Ben Hull) in 2003.

The film stars Li Lili, one of the biggest silent film stars of the period, was a star vehicle for Li Lili, and was also the seventh film of director Sun Yu, who was the best known auteur of Shanghai Cinema during the 1920s. The film Daybreak was created in the commemoration and celebration of the Party's successful completion in the Northern Expedition. Director Sun Yu's films were intended for nationalist propaganda and presents a narrative of redemption as a soft film - the concept where cinema is created as a form of entertainment and a means of aesthetic presentation above all else. The narrative openness encourages and allows cinematic audiences to develop their own political interpretations and in this film, for spectators to produce 'left wing' or 'pro-CCP' messages to emerge from its mise en abyme. It follows a young country girl from a rural fishing village, Lingling (played by Li Lili) as she moves to the glittering city of Shanghai with her boyfriend Zhang (played by Gao Zhanfei). Lingling falls into an unfortunate path, as Zhang drifts into revolutionary circles. Upon arriving to the city, Lingling's own sister sold her to the boss who intoxicates her, rapes her, and forces her into prostitution before eventually becoming a martyr for the coming revolution. An English-subtitled version of the film is available on YouTube.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE4ZBIHNL3E  Cast  * Li Lili - as Lingling, the film's heroine, an innocent, rural, pure, and hopeful young fishing village girl who experiences the darker side of Shanghai. * Gao Zhanfei - as Zhang, Lingling's country lover * Ye Juanjuan * Yuan Congmei * Law Pang * Langen Han * Liu Chi-Chuen * Guilin Wang  Plot  Lingling's rural fishing village was devastated by war and she decided to move to Shanghai in hopes for a better life. She is shown the city's bright lights on the Bund and eventually, finds a job working at a factory. Lingling's life was turned upside down when she was sold by her own sister, intoxicated and raped by the boss, and sold to a brothel. Ironically, her role as a prostitute allowed her to climb into a higher social-class working as a high-class sex worker. In this role, Lingling begins build her wealth and social status, which she hopes to use in helping others including her former factory friends and those less fortunate. Lingling took advantage of an opportunity in helping her former country lover Zhang, by hiding him from the warlord's investigators. As a result, Lingling was incriminated as a revolutionist and was sentenced to death. The executioner Superintendent, Luo Peng, explains that the execution of Lingling would simply become a martyr for the people and fuel their revolutionary rages, but his voice was ignored and was told to continue the execution by his superiors. At the end of the film, Lingling requests the firing squad to shoot only when she is smiling her best. Lingling's action inspire Luo Peng and encourages the firing squad to turn their guns towards the oppressive warlord instead, but Luo Peng failed and was shot by his superior. Lingling's last words were that revolutions are endless, another will rise when you take one down, and was executed next to Luo Peng.  Theme  Daybreak incorporates various symbolic interpretations throughout the film. It links the trope of the female protagonist to a persistent discussion on deception and performance in a social and political aspect, and particularly, the 'country girl' and 'modern girl' is used to create the contested notions between the social and political stance. The underlying mechanism or purpose in using this trope is the representation of the woman protagonist as a homo sacer. Lingling can be viewed as a homo sacer, where she was the 'country girl' that was pure and pre-modernized at the country side and when she moves to the city, she becomes the 'modern girl' that was corrupted and modernized. In this sense, Lingling was an example of how a country virgin has been corrupted by the city into simply a means or medium of exchange in a misogynistic world. Daybreak, literally, refers to the morning when daylight first appears in the morning. The film portrays that the city of Shanghai is covered by physical and political darkness waiting for daybreak and the arrival of freedom as the narration is intertitled with drawn pictures of the Shanghai skylines. Lingling's execution appears to take place after daybreak as well, which suggests that any hope of redemption represented by the coming of the morning daylight is a meaningless illusion and expectation as she will be executed shortly.  Translations  Long unavailable in the United States except in poor video quality, Daybreak was eventually released on region free DVD by Cinema Epoch in the United States on May 8, 2007. The disc features English subtitles and also includes Shen Xiling's film, Crossroads. A free version of the film with English subtitles is available on YouTube.

It forms an ion channel in the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and also the outer cell membrane. In the OMM, it allows ATP to diffuse out of the mitochondria into the cytoplasm. In the cell membrane, it is involved in volume regulation. Within all eukaryotic cells, mitochondria are responsible for synthesis of ATP among other metabolite needed for cell survival. VDAC1 therefore allows for communication between the mitochondrion and the cell mediating the balance between cell metabolism and cell death. Besides metabolic permeation, VDAC1 also acts as a scaffold for proteins such as hexokinase that can in turn regulate metabolism. This protein is a voltage-dependent anion channel and shares high structural homology with the other VDAC isoforms (VDAC2 and VDAC3), which are involved in the regulation of cell metabolism, mitochondrial apoptosis, and spermatogenesis. Over expression and misregulation of this pore could lead to apoptosis in the cell leading to a variety of diseases within the body. In particular, since VDAC1 is the major calcium ion transport channel, its dysfunction is implicated in cancer, Parkinson's (PD), and Alzheimer's disease.In addition, recent studies have shown that an over expression within the VDAC1 protein is linked to Type 2 Diabetes. Lund University released a study that demonstrated the effects of blocking VDAC1 over expression can prevent the spread of Type 2 Diabetes. mVDAC1 top down view with alpha helix in the center of the pore.  Structure  mVDAC1 side view showing antiparallel beta strands The three VDAC isoforms (VDAC1, VDAC2, and VDAC3) have highly conserved DNA sequences as well as 3D structures forming a wide β-barrel structure, inside of which the alpha helical N-terminal segment resides to partially close the pore. VDAC1's structure was solved by 3 independent labs by x-ray crystallography, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, or a combination of both. Two of these structural studies were used to determine human VDAC1 (hVDAC1) structure while X-ray crystallography was used to solve murine VDAC1 (mVDAC1) structure that differs from hVDAC1 by only two residues. These determined structures aligned with earlier circular dichorism studies that predicted the presence of alpha helix and β-strand domains. Structural analysis of mVDAC1's structure showed a barrel-like channel composed of 19 amphipathic β-strands, with the N-terminus and C-terminus both facing towards the inter membrane space of the mitochondrion. β-strands are connected via loops and are arranged in an anti- parallel pattern with the exception of β-strands 1 and 19 which are parallel. The pore has a height of 40 Ẳ, spans a distance of 27 Ẳ by 20 Ẳ at the openings and tapers down to 20 Ẳ by 14 Ẳ at the N-terminal α-helix segment in the open state. The closed state conformation has yet to be isolated and determined. Additionally, the N-terminus has an alpha helical segment that is held to the inside wall of the pore by hydrophobic interactions with residues on β-sheets 8-18. This N-terminus can serve as a scaffold for the movement of ions or attachment of proteins. One such example is seen as it is the docking site for HK1 binding. A significant residue to point out is the glutamate located at the 73rd residue on the amino acid chain (E73). This residue is found in VDAC1 and VDAC2 but not VDAC3. The side chain of this charged residue points into the phospholipid bilayer which would normally cause repulsive forces to occur. E73 however, has been implicated in VDAC1 function and interaction.  Function  VDAC1 belongs to the mitochondrial porin family and is expected to share similar biological functions to the other VDAC isoforms. Of the three isoforms, VDAC1 is the main calcium ion transport channel and the most abundantly transcribed. VDAC1 is involved in cell metabolism by transporting ATP and other small metabolites across the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) allowing regulation of the TCA cycle and, by extension, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In yeast cells, ROS accumulates in response to oxidative stress, which results in impaired mitochondrial function and a “petite” phenotype. However, petite yeast cells exhibit a longer lifespan than wild-type cells and indicate a protective function by VDAC1 in similar circumstances, such as aging. = Voltage gating = VDAC1 allows for the conductance of molecules into and out of the mitochondrion. Its permeability is dependent on VDAC1's conformational state which is determined by voltage. At low voltage (10mV), the pore is in an \\"open\\" state where the channel is weakly anion selective and allows for a greater flux of metabolites. Because of the large pore size, metabolic gating under saturated ATP conditions reveal a transport of 2,000,000 ATP/second and a transport of 10,000 ATP under physiological conditions. At a higher voltage in the positive or negative direction (>30mV), the pore is in a \\"closed\\" state and is weakly cation selective allowing for less metabolites to be transported. The flux of metabolites can be seen as negligible.This change in states is mediated by a conformational change in the protein that has yet to be discovered. Since the alpha helical N-terminus segment is located in the center of the pore, it is ideally situated for metabolic gating. This lead researchers to believe that the Alpha helix was a key contributor to determining the conformational states. However, more recent studies have shown the N-terminal is unnecessary for proper voltage gating and therefore suggest the flexible beta barrel as the mechanism of conformational change. = Oligomerization = Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) revealed the presence of VDAC1 monomers as well as dimers and larger oligomers showcasing the interaction of the pore with itself, however, dimers are more frequent. hVDAC1 in particular has been shown to arrange in parallel dimers leading to increased permeability of the pore. The glutamate located at the 73rd position on VDAC1 has also been shown to play a role in oligomerization when in the presence of calcium. VDACs can also oligomerize to form part of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) and, thus, facilitate cytochrome C release, leading to apoptosis. VDACs have also been observed to interact with pro- or antiapoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2 family proteins and kinases, and so may contribute to apoptosis independently from the MPTP.  Clinical significance  The voltage dependent anion channels all function in ion and metabolite transport although their physiological roles are different. Because of their role, dysfunction of the channels can lead to various diseases. VDAC1 has been implicated in cancer through its interactions with the antiapoptotic family of proteins, Bcl-2 proteins, particularly Bcl- xl, and Mcl-1, which are overexpressed during cancer. These two Bcl-2 proteins interact with VDAC1 to regulate calcium ion transport across the OMM and, ultimately, ROS production. While high levels of ROS induce cell death, non- lethal levels interfere with signal transduction pathways that can then promote cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in cancer cells. Moreover, VDAC1 overexpression has been associated with increased apoptotic response and anti-cancer drugs and treatment efficacy, further supporting VDAC1 as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment. VDAC1's function in calcium ion transport has also been linked to neurodegenerative diseases. In PD, VDAC1 increases calcium ion levels within the mitochondria, resulting in increased mitochondrial permeability, disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential, elevated ROS production, cell death, and neuronal degeneration. VDAC1 has been shown to interact with Amyloid β (Aβ) leading to increased conductance of the channel and eventually apoptosis of the cell.  Interactions  VDAC1 acts as a scaffold for many proteins as well as allows for the flux of ions and metabolites through interactions within the pore. A major metabolite that moves through this channel is ATP. A low affinity binding site used for fast transport of this molecule was discovered by the Markov state modeling approach. It was shown that ATP binds to multiple basic residues within the pore sequentially, in essence moving through the channel. VDAC1 has also been shown to interact with: * BCL2-like 1, * Bcl-2-associated X protein, * DYNLT3, * Gelsolin, * PRKCE, * HK1 * Parkin * eNOS * Mcl-1 * HK * ATP  See also  * Voltage-dependent anion channel  References   Further reading        *  External links  * * Category:Ion channels ","title":"VDAC1"},{"id":"14988603","text":"Captain Adam Henry Bogardus (1834–1913) was a world champion and United States champion trap shooter, as well as the inventor of the first practical glass ball trap. He was born in Berne, New York. There, in 1854, he married Cordelia Dearstyne. They moved to Elkhart, Illinois where he became the wing shot champion of the world. He is credited with romanticizing trap shooting. Trap shooting with live pigeons began in the U.S. around 1825, with the first recorded match balls containing feathers, then clay targets. Bogardus invented the first practical glass ball trap in 1877. Glass spheres, filled with feathers, were used as targets, much as clay pigeons are used today. They were called Bogardus balls. One feature of them was ridges which helped ensure that pellets would shatter the sphere, rather than glancing off.TV program What the Victorians Did for Us, BBC, presented by Adam Hart-Davis, \\"Pleasure Seekers\\" episode. In 1883 William Frank Carver defeated Bogardus 19 times in a series of 25 matches. Bogardus and his sons went on to tour with Buffalo Bill's Wild West show. Captain Bogardus remained with the show for a year. Bogardus is in the National Trapshooting Hall of Fame. He died in 1913 in Lincoln, Logan Co., Illinois and is buried in Elkhart, Illinois.

War graves Stone commemorating Lionel de Jersey Harvard and his family Both cemeteries contain war graves of Commonwealth service personnel registered and maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC). Brockley Cemetery contains 195 war graves, 175 from World War I and 19 from World War II. The majority of the graves lie in a War Plot. On the cemetery's west side, a Screen Wall memorial lists those whose graves could not be marked by headstones.BROCKLEY CEMETERY CWGC Cemetery Report, Brockley Cemetery. Ladywell Cemetery contains 226 war graves from World War I and 18 from World War II. A War Graves plot contains 100 graves, the names of those buried there being listed on a Screen War Memorial in Plot D, as well as those buried elsewhere in the cemetery whose graves could not be marked by headstones. The CWGC also maintain a Commemorative Plot, in Plot B, on which 46 headstones have been erected.LEWISHAM (LADYWELL) CEMETERY CWGC Cemetery Report, Ladywell Cemetery. Ladywell entrance gates The Ladywell entrance to the cemetery is Grade II listed. This notes that the gates were built in 1857 to the designs of William Morphrew, for the Lewisham Burial Board. The gates are made of wrought iron, the piers of stone; square, with set back, sloping tops culminating in saddleback gables. The gates are of florid Gothic design, the monogram of the Lewisham Burial Board in the three lower hubs to each gate, with trefoil and barley sugar decoration above. The name LADYWELL CEMETERY may have been inserted, or is more likely a reworking of the original name LEWISHAM CEMETERY; the style of the lettering, however, is clearly of 1857.

Origin Straight Faced began as a Huntington Beach hardcore band named \\"Above All\\" in 1991. The founding members were Eric Glenn Stewart (1973–2007), Ron Moeller, Matthew Polentz, and Samuel Marrs. All members were friends who grew up together in Huntington Beach, California in the late 1980s. Stewart set them up in a warehouse in Santa Ana that his father used to run a construction business out of, and taught the other members how to play. With a handful of originals and cover songs, they played one backyard party. Shortly after the addition of Kevin Grossman as second guitar, Above All broke up due to a rift that split the band in two. At the request of Ron Moeller for his birthday, he and Grossman rented a rehearsal studio and recruited their new friend Johnny Miller to sing. The bass player for that night never showed up so they asked Jack C. Louis to fill in at the last minute. Within a few months, Eric Stewart joined the newly formed group. One week before their first show they brought Marrs in to replace Louis on bass. Early years Grossman dubbed the reconstituted group Straight Faced. The group played its first shows in early 1993 and quickly released Self Will Run Riot, a five song 7\\", after being approached by Bob Becker of Fearless Records at their second show. At this time, Stewart was asked to leave the band. He was replaced soon after by Damon Beard, who had been playing with Polentz and Louis in Adverse Reality. Straight Faced recorded their first full length, Guilty, and released it with Lethal Records, but due to the lack of a signed contract, quickly took the recording to Bob Becker to release on Fearless. They returned to the studio to record Broken in 1996 before setting off on their first European tour, a 7-week stint opening for their friends, Ignite. Epitaph Years After Grossman and Marrs’ departure in 1997, the group enlisted David Tonic and Kevin Norton and signed with Epitaph Records to release Conditioned, their third LP. Following this, Kevin Norton left the group. Damon Beard filled in on bass until also deciding to leave the band a short time later. Beard was then ultimately replaced by Jeff Hibben. A fourth full-length, Pulling Teeth, was released on Epitaph in 2000 before the group disbanded some time thereafter.

FCGR2B participates in the phagocytosis of immune complexes and in the regulation of antibody production by B lymphocytes.  Structure  There are two major forms of FCGR2B existing (FCGR2B1 and FCGR2B2) and they are created by mRNA splicing mechanism, which results in the inclusion (FCGR2B1) or exclusion (FCGR2B2) of the C1 exon sequence. The presence of the C1 exon sequence (in FCGR2B1) results in tethering to the membrane of B cells, whereas its absence (in FCGR2B2) allows fast internalization of the receptor in myeloid cells. Both forms contain the Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Inhibitory Motif (ITIM) in their cytoplasmic regions. The extracellular domains are 95% identical to the domains of FCGR2A and almost completely identical to the FCGR2C (the other members of CD32 family). = Expression = FCGR2B1 is highly expressed by B cells, and its mRNA has also been identified at lower levels on monocytes. FCGR2B2 is highly expressed on basophils and at low levels on monocytes. Cytokine regulation of the expression is positive in the case of IL-10 and IL-6 and negative in the case of TNF-α, C5a and IFN-γ.  Function  The receptor inhibits the functions of activating FcγRs, such as phagocytosis and pro-inflammatory cytokine release, mainly by clustering of FCGR2B with different activating FCGR receptors or with the BCR by immune complexes. The phosphorylated ITIM of FcγRIIB recruits the inositol phosphatases SHIP1 and SHIP2, which inhibit the Ras activation, downregulate MAPK activity and reduce PLCγ function and lead to decreased activation of PKC. Inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway, together with the anti-apoptotic kinase Akt can negatively affect proliferation and survival of the cells. FCGR2B regulates B cell activation by increasing the BCR activation threshold and suppressing B cell mediated antigen presentation to T cells through the ITIM-dependent inhibitory mechanism. Ligation of FCGR2B on B cells downregulates antibody production, prevents the membrane organization of BCR and CD19 and promotes apoptosis. Co- ligation of FCGR2B on dendritic cells inhibits maturation and blocks cell activation. The negative regulatory role of the FCGRIIB molecule is not limited to BCR-induced B-cell activation, but is also functional on other B-cell activation pathways mediated by CD40 and IL-4. FCGR2B expression on follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) is important for capturing the antigen- containing immune complexes which are essential for the germinal centre response. FCGR2B is present on non-leukocyte cells including airway smooth muscle and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, where small immune complexes are internalized inhibiting the pro-inflammatory signalling.  Autoimmunity  FCGR2B is one of the genes thought to influence susceptibility to several autoimmune diseases in humans. Its decreased function is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Goodpasture's disease, multiple sclerosis and others. FCGR2B may be a target for monoclonal antibody therapy for autoimmune diseases as well as malignancies.

Only two (the military XR-9B and one civil example) were built. Development Originally developed by G & A Aircraft with the co-operation of the United States Army Air Forces' Air Technical Service Command, the G & A Model 45B (designated XR-9 Rotocycle by the Army)\\"Short Hop Helicopter\\". Popular Science, April 1946. was a design for a single-seat helicopter of pod-and-boom configuration.Andrade 1979, p. 171. It had a fixed tri-cycle landing gear and three-bladed main and tail rotors. Power would have been supplied by a 126 hp (94 kW) Avco Lycoming XO-290-5 engine. The Model 45C (XR-9A) was the same helicopter with a two-bladed rotor. Neither of the two helicopters were built. G & A Aircraft was purchased by Firestone in 1943,Merriam 2002, p. 64 and was renamed the Firestone Aircraft Company in 1946.Lambermont 1958 A revised two-seat design the revised Model 45C (or XR-9B) was built with a three-bladed main rotor and two-seat in tandem. The first aircraft procured by the Army Air Forces in 1946, it was powered by an Avco Lycoming O-290-7 engine and first flew in March of that year. A civil version, the Model 45D was also built and flown, in anticipation of a postwar boom in aircraft sales. This differed in having the two occupants side-by-side instead of Tandem as in the 45C, and was equipped with a Lycoming engine. The prototype was demonstrated at the 1946 Cleveland National Air Races. A four-seat Model 50, with twin tail rotors, was also projected, but the predicted sales boom did not materialise, and Firestone closed its aircraft manufacturing division.

Distinguished in the Balkan Wars, he became twice the chief of the Greek Navy General Staff, and occupied the post of Minister for Naval Affairs in 1935.  Life  Sofoklis Dousmanis was born in Corfu on 25 December 1868, a descendant of a branch of the Albanian Dushmani family that had emigrated to Corfu in the 15th century; he was the grandson of Antonio Dusmani and brother of Viktor Dousmanis. He entered the Hellenic Naval Academy on 20 May 1884 and graduated on 18 June 1888 as a Line Ensign. He was subsequently promoted to Sub-Lieutenant (8 January 1890), Lieutenant (14 November 1896), Lt. Commander (6 May 1905), and Commander (29 March 1910). He served aboard various ships and in staff positions, including as instructor at the Navy Academy (1908–09), and as captain of the destroyer Nafkratousa (1906), the ironclad Psara (1910–11), the troop carrier Sfaktiria (1911 and 1912), and of the newly delivered cruiser Georgios Averof (1911), as well as chief of staff of the Exercise Squadron (1911). With the outbreak of the First Balkan War in October 1912, he became captain of Averof as well as chief of staff to the Aegean Fleet commander, Rear Admiral Pavlos Koundouriotis, who used the Averof as his flagship. In this capacity he participated in the two victorious naval battles of Elli and Lemnos, as well as the capture of several Aegean islands as well as Mount Athos, Kavala and Dedeagatch. On 2 June 1913, he was promoted to Captain, and to Rear Admiral on 15 April 1914. After briefly assuming command of the Battleship Squadron, he was appointed Chief of the Navy General Staff in June 1914, serving until the resignation of King Constantine I and the assumption of government by Eleftherios Venizelos in June 1917. The new government placed him on suspended service and retired him on 20 October 1917, followed by internal exile in 1918–20. After the Venizelist electoral defeat in November 1920 and the return of King Constantine, he was recalled to active service (6 November 1920) and served as Chief of the Aegean Fleet (January–April 1921), which he led in the attempts to stop the seaborne resupply of Mustafa Kemal's Turkish National Movement, and again Chief of the Navy General Staff (December 1921-October 1922). After the Greek defeat in the Asia Minor Campaign and the 11 September 1922 Revolution, he was again placed into suspended service and retired on 19 January 1923 as Vice Admiral. On 2 March 1935, he became Minister for Naval Affairs in the Panagis Tsaldaris cabinet, a post he kept until the government's resignation on 10 October 1935. On 25 March 1935, he was recalled to active service as a full Admiral for exceptional service, remaining in active commission until 20 November 1935. In 1939, he edited and published the Averofs captain's log during the Balkan Wars period. He died in Athens in 1952.

Isoforms and derivatives  The protein has four isoforms—alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta- PPT—which can variably undergo post-translational modification to produce neurokinin A (formerly known as substance K) and substance P. Alpha- and delta-PPT can only be modified to substance P, whereas beta- and gamma-PPT can produce both substance P and neurokinin A. Neurokinin A can also be further modified to produce neuropeptide K (also known as neurokinin K) and neuropeptide gamma. These hormones are thought to function as neurotransmitters which interact with nerve receptors and smooth muscle cells. They are known to induce behavioral responses and function as vasodilators and secretagogues. Alternative splicing of exons 4 and/or 6 produces four known products of undetermined significance.  Human basal ganglia  The nature and distribution of PPT-1 has been studied in the human basal ganglia. The protein is expressed evenly throughout the caudate and putamen, and 80 to 85% of it exists in the beta-PPT isoform. 15-20% of the protein is in the gamma- PPT isoform, while no alpha-PPT was detected at all.  Species comparison  In humans, beta-PPT is the dominant isoform in the brain, which contrasts with rats (predominantly gamma-PPT) and cows (alpha-PPT). While both human and rat PPT-1 produce substance P and neurokinin A, humans produce more neuropeptide K, whereas rats produce more neuropeptide gamma. In cow brains, PPT-1 primarily encodes substance P, but not other neurokinin A-derived peptides.

Prior to this appointment she was a professional librarian, and served as the first female Chief Executive of the British Library, the United Kingdom's national library, from July 2000 until July 2012. She is also a member of the Ofcom Board. Early life and education Brindley gained a first class degree in music at the University of Reading around 1975 and then began her professional career as a library trainee at the Bodleian Library, University of Oxford. She studied librarianship at the School of Librarianship, University College London, where she was awarded the Sir John MacAlister Medal as top student on her course. Career She first worked for the British Library in 1979, in the Bibliographic Services Division and by 1983 she led the chief executive's office. She moved on to be director of library services at the University of Aston, and spent some time as a consultant for KPMG. She was librarian of the British Library of Political and Economic Science at the London School of Economics (LSE), before moving to the University of Leeds as Librarian and Keeper of the Brotherton Collection, and later as Pro Vice-Chancellor. On 17 November 2011, Brindley announced that she would be stepping down from her post as Chief Executive at the British Library at the end of July 2012. Brindley became the Master of Pembroke College, Oxford, from 1 August 2013. =Context of change= A switch from print to digital publishing by the year 2020 is anticipated; which implies that readers will have diminishing physical contact with books, the primary experience and foundation of civilisation for the last 500 years. In this context of change, Brindley is committed to ensuring that the Library does not become little more than \\"a book museum\\". Brindley's explained: > \\"Most people are aware that a national switch to digital broadcasting is > expected by the end of this decade. Less well known is the fact that a > similar trend is underway in the world of publishing: by the year 2020, 40% > of UK research monographs will be available in electronic format only, while > a further 50% will be produced in both print and digital. A mere 10% of new > titles will be available in print alone by 2020.\\" Book preservation Brindley's British Library has long been the conservator of historic print collections and regarded as a place of quiet study; but with the explosion of the internet and electronic publishing, users are increasingly turning their backs on libraries as a physical space, using them as virtual, digital environments instead. In this context, the British Library's role in warehousing large book collections is at risk. Research Brindley accords special priority to the needs of researchers and believes that libraries should also play a key role in helping to teach information literacy skills. In this context, Brindley observed: > \\"[That t]he younger generation is technologically more literate but not more > information literate is a challenge that must be tackled by libraries and > education more widely. Students who simply want to use Google and take what > it says as gospel do a real disservice to the skills people will > increasingly need to survive in the digital economy. Libraries add a degree > of sophistication, support and richness of content, all of which will > encourage creativity, quality research and participation of the citizen in > the global digital world that we are in.\\" Academic awards Brindley has received honorary degrees of D.Litt. from the University of Leicester on 11 July 2002, the University of Reading in 2004 and the University of Leeds on 14 July 2006. In April 2006 she was awarded an honorary degree from the Open University as Doctor of the University for \\"Public services and exceptional contribution to the educational or cultural well-being of society\\".

Origin and beliefs It was founded on November 17, 1885, the day following the execution of Métis Leader Louis Riel. Many French-speaking Catholics resented the way the federal government of Sir John A. Macdonald had Riel hanged for treason. Mercier proposed to create a broader coalition which would include Conservative dissidents as well as his Liberal base. In the following days 50,000 people gathered in the Champ de Mars in Montreal to hear Mercier voice their support for Riel.Susan Mann, The Dream of Nation: A Social and Intellectual History of Quebec, 2002 The Parti National, which was not affiliated with any federal party, promised to use the influence of the provincial government protect the autonomy of Quebec and of its French-speaking and Catholic identity. Rise to power The party won a narrow majority of seats to the Legislative Assembly of Quebec in the 1886 provincial election and took office in January 1887. It won a landslide victory in the 1890 election, doing poorly only in the Mauricie area where it was opposed by Ultramontan Catholic Bishop Louis-François Richer Laflèche. Its achievements include: * Organizing the first interprovincial conference in Quebec City in 1887 * Passing the Jesuit Estates Act, which gave the order $400,000 in compensation for loss of property confiscated by the government decades earlier * Establishing a department of Agriculture and Colonization in 1887 and appointing Curé Labelle as its deputy minister * Expanding the railroad to support the migration of urban residents to rural parts of Quebec, such as the Laurentides and Gaspésie * Creating night schools, starting in 1889 Anne-Hélène Pénault and Francine Sénéval, L'éducation des adultes au Québec depuis 1850: points de repère, Montreal, February 1982, page 27 Decline With only 18 months served in its second term of office, the National Party was caught in a corruption scandal and removed from office by Quebec Lieutenant-governor Auguste-Réal Angers. Mercier stepped down as party leader and the Liberals were overwhelmingly defeated in the 1892 election. Mercier was later cleared of all charges. Other Partis Nationaux * Mercier had tried to create a \\"Parti national\\" in 1872. This first attempt seems to have been short-lived and fruitless. Biography of Honoré Mercier, Assemblée nationale du Québec *Nationalist politicians René Chaloult, Oscar Drouin, Joseph-Ernest Grégoire, Philippe Hamel and Adolphe Marcoux announced the creation of a \\"Parti National\\" in 1937, after they had left the Union Nationale.

Under German wine legislation, Baden and Württemberg are separate wine regions. With under vine in 2008, Baden is Germany's third largest wine region,German Wine Institute: German wine statistics 2009/2010 but seems to be much less known on export markets in comparison to many smaller German regions, and in comparison to the neighbouring French region of Alsace, which is of similar size. Winemaking cooperatives are very common in Baden, number around 100, and are responsible for 85% of the region's production.Wein-Plus Glossar: Baden, read on January 23, 2013  History  Although this wine region has a long history of winemaking neither the colour nor quality of the earliest wines is now known. In the Kraichgau the high noble Counts of Katzenelnbogen received their title and were famous for supporting viticulture since the 12th. century. Later they showed up in the history of wine again when they planted Riesling for the first time in Rüsselsheim.http://www.graf- von-katzenelnbogen.de/ Baden, The History of the County of Katzenelnbogen and the First Riesling of the World  Geography  Vineyards on Lake Constance, the southernmost part of Baden as well as the southernmost vineyards in Germany. Baden is Germany's longest wine region, approximately 400 km (250miles) and reaching from the border of Franken in the north to Lake Constance in the south, and is primarily situated on the eastern bank of river Rhine. Much of Baden is situated in the Rhine rift, which is protected by the Black Forest and the Vosges mountains to the west of Rhine, and is therefore Germany's warmest location. Therefore, its wines are usually more full-bodied and higher in alcohol than wines from other German regions, and it is the only German wine region situated in European Union wine growing zone B rather than A.J. Robinson (ed), \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\", Third Edition, p 59, Oxford University Press 2006, Alsace is in France on the other side of Rhine from Baden. Due to its very large north-south length, Baden is divided into nine districts (Bereiche), which is more than any other German wine region.German Wine Institute: Soil & Sites , read on January 1, 2008 From north to south, these districts are:H. Johnson & J. Robinson, \\"The World Atlas of Wine\\", Fifth Edition, pp 215 & 235, Mitchell Beazley, London 2001, * Tauberfranken, in the northeastern outskirts of the region and neighbouring Franconia. The wines are similar to the wines of Franconia, and are sold in the round Bocksbeutel bottle characteristic of Franconia. * Badische Bergstrasse, the vineyards of which is a continuation of those of the small region Hessische Bergstrasse. This district is situated around the city of Heidelberg. * Kraichgau, just to the south of Badische Bergstrasse, and north- east of the city of Karlsruhe. * Ortenau, from Baden-Baden to just south of Offenburg is one of the more well-known districts. * Breisgau, from just south of Offenburg and to Freiburg. According to meteorological statistics, it has the highest average temperature and the number of sunshine hours of the region. * Kaiserstuhl, a cluster of hills of volcanic origin northwest of Freiburg with characteristic terraced vineyards. Its wines are powerful and it is probably the best-known district of Baden. * Tuniberg is situated on flatter land just south of Kaiserstuhl and west of Freiburg, and produces wines of a lighter style. * Markgräflerland stretches from Freiburg to the Swiss border at Basel, and is known for its easy-drinking Gutedel (Chasselas) wines. * Bodensee is situated in the southeastern outskirts of the region, on the northwestern shores of Lake Constance, which is known as Bodensee in German.  Grape varieties  A blanc de noir from the Baden made from Pinot noir grapes pressed quickly after harvest in order to make a white wine from the red grapes. Grape varieties of the Pinot family are responsible for almost 55% of the vineyards of Baden, with Spätburgunder (Pinot noir) covering 36.8% of Baden's vineyards in 2008 or , Grauburgunder (Pinot gris) 10.5% and Weißburgunder (Pinot blanc) 7.3%. Baden thus has larger total plantations of these three Pinot varieties than any other German wine region. Correspondingly, Riesling (7.3% in 2008) plays a smaller role than in most other regions, although it is more common around some villages. Müller-Thurgau is grown on 17.2% of Baden's vineyards, and plantings have decreased considerably in recent years to be replaced by Spätburgunder and other red grape varieties. Gutedel (Chasselas) is also grown on 6.9% of the vineyard surface, making Baden practically the only region in Germany where Gutedel wines are produced, and the region accounts for over 97% of Germany's plantings of this variety. In total, there are 44% red grape varieties in Baden, and 56% white.

Bussey was killed in action during World War II. He was the only Bears player to die in the war. Biography =Early life= Ruey Young Bussey was born in Timpson, Texas, the youngest of Katherine Lee \\"Katie\\" Bussey (née Hughes) and Thomas Wade \\"Tom\\" Bussey's 13 children. The family later moved to Humble, located near Houston. Tom worked several odd jobs, before landing a supervisory position at a firm that manufactured train equipment. However, he abandoned the family in 1928, and later died in March 1935. When Katie became become the head of the household, Young worked to help to support the family by delivering milk, waking up at 3:00 AM to walk his delivery route. Bussey excelled at sports, such as football, baseball, boxing, wrestling, swimming, diving, water polo, track and his favorite, basketball. By age 12, he had become so coordinated that his teacher had to “rig” the softball teams during recess in an attempt to prevent him from dominating the game. As a teenager, Bussey attended San Jacinto High School, where his athletic skills and brash antics drew large crowds at games and attracted the attention of local sports writers. His classmates at San Jacinto included Walter Cronkite and Denton Cooley. =College career= Bussey played football at LSU on a scholarship arranged by Senator Huey Long. While there, he became a team captain and led LSU in rushing in 1937, and in passing in both 1937 and 1938. He and teammate Ken Kavanaugh were also invited to try out for the Chicago Bears. Despite the time constraints of playing a sport and continuing to support his family via his milk delivery route, Bussey still managed to graduate with top grades and a degree in petroleum engineering. =Professional career= Bussey was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the 20th round of the 1940 NFL draft. He quickly established a brazen reputation for himself, once telling Bears owner/coach George Halas that \\"he'd come to be a winner and the coach needed to either trade established quarterback Sid Luckman or keep him on as Bussey's backup.\\" Teammate Bulldog Turner later opined that \\"[c]oaching Young was nearly impossible.\\" Halas assigned Bussey to the American Association's Newark Bears, which Halas had recently purchased. Bussey excelled in Newark, becoming the AA's passing leader. Bussey finally made the Bears' squad in 1941, as Luckman's backup. He scored his first points in the NFL on October 5, throwing two touchdowns in a 48-21 road victory over the Cleveland Rams. He repeated this feat on October 12, in a 53–7 home victory over the Chicago Cardinals. Bussey quickly became a favorite amongst Bears fans; as biographer Ralph Cushman wrote, \\"he had become the Bears' instant offense. The crowd quickly recognized his potential for electric action and screamed approval when he trotted into the arena. Actual records fail to define just how prolific Young was from the standpoint of points per minute of play...[he] often was sent in for a quick score and then was held in reserve as the Bears' defense dug in to preserve the lead.\\" Bussey appeared in 10 games during the 1941 regular season, completing 13 of 40 passes for 353 yards, five touchdowns, and three interceptions. He also tallied two interceptions while playing defense, as well as one 40-yard punt return. The final day of the season was December 7, the same day Pearl Harbor was bombed, and the playoffs continued even after the U.S. declared war on Japan. The Bears defeated the New York Giants, 37–9, in the 1941 NFL Championship Game on December 21; Bussey attempted just one pass, an 8-yard completion. While waiting to be drafted, Bussey took a job building Liberty ships for the Houston Shipbuilding Corporation. He briefly attended the Bears' training camp in the summer of 1942, but Halas was committed to starting Luckman at quarterback. On August 28, Bussey played in the 1942 College All-Star Game in Chicago before a crowd of 101,103 spectators, throwing one touchdown in a 21–0 victory over the college players. Shortly after the game ended, he informed Halas of his intent to enlist. He did so the very next day, joining the Naval Reserve. =Military service and death= Bussey was sent to Officer Candidate School, attained the rank of lieutenant (junior grade), and was assigned to USS Warren, an attack transport active in the Pacific Theater. He received a commendation from Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, commander of the U.S. Fifth Fleet, for his actions as an assistant beachmaster during the Battle of Guam in 1944. Bussey also saw action at Kwajalein, Peleliu, Leyte, and Luzon, participating in a total of 10 amphibious assaults. He was then named Warren's head beachmaster for the upcoming Invasion of Lingayen Gulf. By this point, Bussey had become pessimistic about his chances of survival; while home on leave shortly before the invasion, Bussey confessed to his older brother Keefer (himself a combat engineer in the Army) that he believed he \\"would not come out of his next landing alive,\\" and gave Keefer his commemorative watch from the 1941 Championship Game. The night before General Walter Krueger's Sixth Army landed on the beaches of Lingayen Gulf, Bussey turned over his personal effects to Warren's chaplain, telling him, \\"Tomorrow I make my ascension. Will you see that my mother gets these?\\" True to his prediction, Bussey was killed on January 7, 1945, when his landing craft took a direct hit from a Japanese mortar after getting stuck on a coral reef 75 yards from the beach. The blast threw Bussey and most of the crew into the water; eyewitnesses reported that Bussey was struck in his left shoulder and chest, and that his left arm may have been completely blown off. He was last seen signalling his men with his right arm to take cover. Most of the crew of the landing craft were rescued, but Bussey was not among them, and his body was never recovered.

In the game of football, progress is measured by advancing the football towards the opposing team's goal line. Progress can be made during play by the offensive team by advancing the ball from the point of progress at the start of play known as the line of scrimmage. When the offensive team advances the ball by rushing the football, the player who carries the ball is given credit for the difference in progress measured in rushing yards. When the offensive team advances the ball by pass reception, the player who catches the reception is given credit for the difference in progress measured in reception yards. Although the ball may also be advanced by penalty these yards are not considered yards from scrimmage. Progress lost via quarterback sacks are classified variously by league of play with rules having changed over time within some leagues. The total of rushing yards and receiving yards is known as yards from scrimmage. This definition of yardage differs from total offense which gives credit for passing yardage to the person throwing the football rather than receiving the football. This is an important statistic for running backs that contribute significantly to the passing attack. Many teams have special lineups for passing plays in which running backs who are better receivers are substituted into the game. Some running backs are notable for the fact that they are both a primary rushing and primary passing weapon. Notable running backs known for yards from scrimmage include Roger Craig, the first National Football League (NFL) player to have 1,000 yards rushing and receiving in the same season, Walter Payton, the NFL career record holder among running backs (until broken by Emmitt Smith), and Chris Johnson, the NFL single-season record holder. Thurman Thomas once led the NFL in yards from scrimmage four consecutive years. Yards from scrimmage differs from all- purpose yards, which include all forms of return yards such as yards on kickoff returns, punt returns, interception returns, and fumble recovery returns, in addition to yards from scrimmage.

It stars Michèle Morgan and Paul Henreid, with Thomas Mitchell, Laird Cregar and May Robson in her last role. Joan of Paris marked the U.S. screen debuts of Austrian Henreid and Frenchwoman Morgan. Henreid had previously appeared in some British-American co-productions made in England and had starred on Broadway in the play Flight to the West as Paul von Hernreid. When he was signed with RKO in 1942, the studio changed his surname, dropping the \\"von\\" and changing his last name to \\"Henreid\\", the name he used for the rest of his film career.Miller, Frank. \\"Articles: 'Joan of Arc' (1942).\\" Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved August 15, 2020. Cregar was borrowed from 20th- Century Fox. Alan Ladd, who played one of the downed airmen, would soon become a star later that year.Churchill. Douglas W. \\"Out of the Hollywood hopper.\\" The New York Times, October 5, 1941, p. X5. After his breakthrough starring role in This Gun for Hire (1942), Joan of Paris was re-released with Ladd more prominently featured. Plot In German-occupied Paris, an announcer reports that Royal Air Force bombers have been shot down. Five downed pilots split up and make their way to Paris to try to get help in returning to England. On the way, they break into a tavern in search of civilian clothes. When a German soldier shows up for a drink, Squadron Leader Paul Lavallier (Paul Henreid), a member of the Free French, knocks him out and takes his money. In Paris, Paul contacts an old teacher of his, Father Antoine (Thomas Mitchell), who agrees to hide the reunited men in the sewers underneath his cathedral. \\"Baby\\" (Alan Ladd) has been shot in the shoulder along the way. When he slumps over in the church, it attracts the attention of a Gestapo agent (Alexander Granach). Paul manages to distract him, allowing Baby to slip away, but then the German starts following Paul. Paul tries to hide in a café, where he is served by Joan (Michèle Morgan), but the agent finds him. In his haste to get away, the airman tears the sleeve of Joan's dress. He then enters the first unlocked room he finds in a nearby building. By chance, it is Joan's. She discovers him hiding in her closet when she goes to change. To allay her fears, he tells her that Father Antoine sent him to give her enough money to buy a new dress. He persuades her to deliver a message to Father Antoine, describing his predicament. As they begin working together, they fall in love. Later, Paul gets Father Antoine to visit a British spy (John Abbott) who has been caught and is to be executed. The priest is able to overcome the doomed man's suspicions and obtains the name of a contact, schoolteacher Mademoiselle Rosay (May Robson). Because the church is being watched by the persistent Gestapo agent, Father Antoine asks the unsuspected Joan to meet Rosay. However, on the way there, she passes the shop where she bought her new garment. A second Gestapo man (an uncredited Hans Conreid) has traced the bank note she used as payment to the robbed soldier and follows her. She and Mademoiselle Rosay barely escape capture. Rosay arranges for a seaplane to land at night on the Seine River to pick up the men. Gestapo head Herr Funk (Laird Cregar) plays a cat-and-mouse game with Joan and Paul. When Paul is picked up for not having identification papers, Funk apologizes for the inconvenience and releases him so he can lead the Germans to the others. That night, Paul finally tells Joan his real identity. He promises to marry her when the war is over. However, he is unable to shake the Gestapo agent, so Joan takes the map of the rendezvous point to the others. While they wait for the appointed time, Baby dies of his wound. Meanwhile, Paul finally manages to kill the Gestapo man in a Turkish bath, but too late to reach the rendezvous in time. Funk then offers Joan a devil's bargain: Paul's life if she will lead him to the hiding place of the other men. She agrees. Finding Paul praying in the cathedral, she tells him that the others are still waiting for him. She then leads Funk on a wild goose chase, giving the airmen time to make good their escape. Later, she faces the firing squad bravely.

According to pre-production news items in The Hollywood Reporter, RKO considered Charles Boyer, Robert Morley and Jean Gabin for leads in the film. Producer David Hempstead wanted Julien Duvivier to direct the project because Gabin and Michele Morgan had worked with Duvivier in Europe. Lewis Milestone was initially assigned to direct the film but resigned over differences with the studio. Joan of Paris used the largest single set constructed by the studio since the making of Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939). Principal photography took place from mid-September to late October 1941, and although ready for release in December 1941, RKO held the film back for an early 1942 release to capitalize on public interest in films about World War II.\\"Original print information: 'Joan of Arc' (1942).\\" Turner Classic Movies.

Also known as CD122; IL15RB; P70-75.  Function  The interleukin 2 receptor, which is involved in T cell-mediated immune responses, is present in 3 forms with respect to ability to bind interleukin 2. The low affinity form is a monomer of the alpha subunit (also called CD25) and is not involved in signal transduction. The intermediate affinity form consists of a gamma/beta subunit heterodimer, while the high affinity form consists of an alpha/beta/gamma subunit heterotrimer. Both the intermediate and high affinity forms of the receptor are involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis and transduction of mitogenic signals from interleukin 2. The protein encoded by this gene represents the beta subunit and is a type I membrane protein. This protein also forms one of the three subunits of the IL-15 receptor. Activation of the receptor increases proliferation of CD8+ effector T cells.  Interactions  IL2RB has been shown to interact with: * CISH, * HGS, * Janus kinase 1, and * SHC1.

Plot summary In Pittsburgh, Judge Hammersley runs into Albert, who says it is soon to be his uncle's birthday; the judge says he should come round to his house before, so he can give him some alcohol. Back home, he tells his daughter he has run into him; she goes off to a ball. Meanwhile, the two Alberts are playing classical music and reading decadent literature. In an analepsis, the reader gets an account of Uncle Albert when he was working as a throat doctor in Allegheny. He once came upon a singer whom he wanted to bring to New York City, since he believed her to be very talented. However, after graduation, she eloped to Chicago, but eventually came back and was fairly successful until she came down with a throat disease, which proved fatal. Albert goes to Judge Hammersley's to get the alcohol. He is greeted by Margaret, and they talk about the time they spent in Rome when they were younger. Her father gives him two bottles of champagne. Later, Margaret comes to the birthday party and Albert tells her about the last time he saw their former music teacher, Rafael Joseffy, noting that he was sick. Finally, they toast to Lenore, the singer Uncle Albert had brought to success in New York. Characters *Judge Hammersley *Albert Englehardt.

She won 17 graded stakes races, including 11 Grade I (some against males and older mares), in three seasons for $3,286,388 in earnings.  Background  Serena's Song is a smaller than average, but athletically built bay mare. Her sire Rahy was a Grade II winner on turf and Grade I-placed, but was more successful at stud and became notable primarily as a sire of broodmares and racemares. Rahy has also sired 2006 U.S. Champion Two-Year-Old Filly Dreaming of Anna, Breeders' Cup Turf winner and European Horse of the Year Fantastic Light, and the outstanding broodmare Mariah's Storm, among other notable horses. Serena's Song's dam Imagining, a daughter of Northfields, won two of her 26 races but became a successful broodmare who also produced Grade III winner Vivid Imagination and graded stakes producers River Saint and Serena's Sister. Serena's Song was bred in Kentucky by Dr. Howard J. Baker. Hall of Fame trainer D. Wayne Lukas bought her at the 1993 Keeneland July yearling sale for $150,000 for Eclipse of Merit owners Robert and Beverly Lewis.  Two-year-old season  In her two-year-old season, Serena's Song started 10 times and won four races. She also finished second twice and third once while compiling earnings of $597,335. In the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies, she finished second to the undefeated champion Flanders by a head. In the Grade I Hollywood Starlet Stakes, she beat Urbane.  Three-year-old season  In 13 starts at age three, Serena's Song won 9. One of her top performances was in the de facto second jewel of the filly Triple Crown, the $200,000 Grade II Black-Eyed Susan Stakes. That race was run on May 19, 1995, over a mile and one eighth at Pimlico Race Course. Serena's Song beat a field of seven stakes winners, including Conquistadoress and Rare Opportunity. Serena's Song also beat males that year in the Jim Beam Stakes and the Haskell Invitational Handicap. She defeated older females in the Beldame Stakes. That year, she brought home the American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly award, winning $1,524,920.  Four-year-old season  In 1996, when she was four, Serena's Song started 15 times, winning 5 times, placing in 7 races, and coming in third twice. She ran over eight tracks and never finished worse than third. In May, she shipped to Baltimore and won the grade two Pimlico Distaff, now called the Allaire duPont Distaff Stakes, on the Preakness Stakes undercard.

His maternal great-grandfather was Israel Hönig, Edler von Hönigsberg, the first Jew raised to nobility in Austria.see Kompert, Oesterreichische Adelshalle für Israeliten \\"Jahrbücher\\" When fifteen years of age, he entered Anton von Schmid's printing establishment in Vienna, which his father had acquired. The Talmud published with the imprint of Von Schmid and Bush was prized for some time afterwards for its exactness. For six years (1842–47) Bush edited and published the Kalender und Jahrbuch für Israeliten (Vienna). Its plan was the presentation in the same book of the productions of leading Jewish scholars of divergent views. Among these were Leopold Zunz, S. L. Rapoport, S. D. Luzzatto, Gotthold Salomon, Ludwig Philippson, Michael Sachs, Isaac Noah Mannheimer, Joseph Wertheimer, Leopold Stern, Theodor Creizenach, Ludwig August von Frankl, Leopold Kompert, Leopold Löw, and Simon Szanto. Some of these made their first appearance as writers in the pages of the \\"Jahrbücher.\\" In 1844 he edited Mesillat ha-Limmud (Way of Instruction), which was published by his father after Bush had left for America. Liberal in politics, he edited the Osterreichisches Zentral-Organ für Glaubensfreiheit, and other revolutionary papers issued from his press. Career in the US When the Revolution of 1848 failed he had to flee to New York City, where he arrived Jan. 8, 1849. There Bush opened a store for the sale of newspapers and stationery, and, on March 30, 1849, published the initial number of Israel's Herald, the first Jewish weekly in the United States, which, however, lived only three months. He was assisted in producing it by leading members of the Order B'nai B'rith. In the summer of 1849 Bush went to St. Louis, where he managed a general store for six years. In 1857 Bush was made president of the People's Savings Bank. When the Missouri Convention was called to determine whether the state should join in the secession movement, Bush was chosen a member on the Unconditional Union ticket, and was made a member of the Committee of Nine, to which most important matters were referred. When Fremont took command in 1861, with headquarters in St. Louis, Bush was made his aide- de-camp, with the rank of captain. He submitted to Secretary of the Treasury Chase a plan for a government loan of one hundred million dollars, similar to the famous Rothschild premium loans of Austria. Mr. Chase feared its rejection by Congress, but was impressed with Bush's financial genius, and offered him a Treasury clerkship. Bush returned shortly afterward to St. Louis, and became for six years general freight and passenger agent of the St. Louis and Iron Mountain Railroad Company. He assisted in forming Congregation B'ne El in St. Louis along with Daniel BlockEhrlich, Walter. Zion in the Valley. The Jewish Community of St. Louis. Volume 1. 1807-1907. University of Missouri Press. Columbia and London. 1997. and in establishing the Independent Order B'nai B'rith in the West, and was henceforth prominently identified with the Order, rendering especially useful service in connection with its endowment or insurance feature, and in forming the Cleveland Jewish Orphan Asylum. His interest in the society led him to become an insurance actuary. Bush was chosen member of the state convention called to abolish slavery and to form a new constitution. He was elected a member of the Missouri state board of immigration to repair losses in population resulting from the war, which post he retained for twelve years. Later in life Bush became interested in viticulture. He purchased a tract of land (named by him \\"Bushberg\\") outside the city, which became noted for its products; and he even sent large quantities of cuttings from his vineyards to France to replace ravages by phylloxera. Bush, after years of preparation, published a catalogue of grapes, The Bushberg Catalogue, which has gone through several editions and has been translated into several languages. Bush died in St. Louis in 1898 and was buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery.

Total offense differs from yards from scrimmage, which gives credit for passing yardage to the person receiving the football rather than the person throwing the football. In the game of football, progress is measured by advancing the football towards the opposing team's goal line. The team on offense can make progress during the play by advancing the ball from the line of scrimmage. When the offensive team advances the ball by rushing the football, the player who carries the ball is given credit for the net gain, measured in rushing yards. When the offensive team advances the ball by pass reception, the player who throws the ball earns passing yards and the player who receives the ball earns receiving yards. The total of rushing yards and passing yards (but not receiving yards) is known as total offense. Although the ball may also be advanced by penalty, these yards do not contribute to total offense. Progress lost via quarterback sacks are classified differently, depending upon the league and/or level of football. When defenses are measured on total offense allowed, it is called total defense. Some definitions of individual total offense give credit to both the passer and receiver for passing yards. Thus, if a quarterback catches a pass in a trick play, or a non-quarterback throws a pass, some statistical issues arise. Steve McNair holds the NCAA career and single-season total offense/game records. Case Keenum, B.J. Symons, and David Klingler hold the total offense career, single-season and single game records. NCAA definition The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) defines the term as \\"Total offense is the total of net gain rushing and net gain forward passing. Receiving and runback yards are not included in total offense.\\" (at pg. 206).

The tomb is located on a mountain about 25 kilometers from the city of Datong, in Shanxi Province. When her husband died in 465, Empress Dowager Wenming became regent until her stepson, Emperor Xiaowen, attained his adulthood. While Emperor Xiaowen assumed the imperial powers upon adulthood, she remained highly influential until her death in 490. This was at the time Buddhism became a state religion and Empress Dowager Wenming was responsible for the imperial shrines at Yungang Grottoes. There is evidence that The Empress Dowager Wenming masterminded the transformation of the government and the sinification movement. When the Empress died she was buried with extraordinary honors. Emperor Xiaowen was distraught and could not eat or drink for five days. The tomb Northern Wei shrine painting, Yungang Grottoes 460-525 ADNorthern Wei tombs and shrines were of considerable architectural importance and the Empress's tomb was built during a period of striking tomb and shrine building. The construction of her tomb had begun in 484 on Mount Fang (Fangshan, the modern name is Liangshan, i.e., Mount Liang). It sits on hilly ground along with other royal tombs. It was excavated in 1976 and has been the subject of scholarly research. The double-chambered royal tomb, with its distinctive architecture, is dug into the side of a hill. It was created in the period before the capital of the Northern Wei moved to Luoyang. Over her bricked tomb was built a huge mound almost 33 metres high with a square base. Leading down from the mound was a diagonal ramp leading into an antechamber, then through a connective passageway to a large burial chamber. The total length of the interior was almost 18 metres, larger than any tomb in the area and one of the largest tombs of the Wei excavated so far. The walls were covered with relief sculptures. As mentioned, this royal tomb has two chambers, the first an anteroom to which the bricked pathway led. Single chamber tombs were more common for nonroyal burials. The anteroom had a simple barrel vault roof. However, the roof of the burial chamber in the back had a coffer ceiling that, although vaulted, had a flat wooden beamed top. A stone Hall of Eternal Resoluteness was built 600 metres to the south of the tomb with a walkway lined with stelae with inscriptions of funerary text and lined with sculptures of animals. A wall enclosed the whole funerary area with the entrance marked by free standing gate towers (que). The tomb is oriented on a north-south axis with the tomb's entrance on the south.

It began on December 28, 2007 and concluded on January 31, 2008 with the premiere of the fourth season of Lost. The free registration ARG follows Oceanic Airlines IT technician Sam Thomas as he investigates the whereabouts of Oceanic Flight 815, on which his girlfriend Sonya was a flight attendant. Of the 324 people on board the flight, seventy-one survived and they serve as the characters of Lost. Lost previously hosted an ARG during the hiatus between the second and third seasons called the Lost Experience. Find 815 was produced by digital entertainment company Hoodlum and ABC.  Gameplay  = Pre-release = On December 28, 2007, ABC's press website (ABC Medianet) uploaded a press release announcing the return to business of the fictitious Oceanic Airlines.Daily News Releases The release contained a phone number, which when called, instructs the listener to visit a website, which features a commercial for Oceanic. On December 31, the site was updated with a video of Sam explaining his situation intercut with flashes of a URL. The official Find 815 website contains more videos of Sam as he begins to uncover the truth of what happened to 815. At Sydney Airport, the Seven Network placed a billboard near the exit, featuring a picture of an Oceanic Airlines hostess and the company's symbol with the words \\"find815.com\\" 'painted' over the company's name. = Chapter 1 = On December 31, 2007, Find815.com launched, and players were able to start the game. A newscast kicks off the game, and visitors learn that Oceanic Airways is making two monumental decisions: (1) the search for Flight 815 is to be called off, and (2) Oceanic Airways will be returning to the skies. Protagonist Sam Thomas is introduced, and his connection to 815/LOST is explained in subsequent video diaries. It turns out that Sam's partner, Sonya, was a flight attendant for Oceanic, and was on Flight 815. Only a few short months after 815 crashed, Oceanic will be calling off the search and focusing on its return to the skies. However, Sam has been quite vocal about the need to continue the search, and how he's going to \\"get to the bottom of what's really going on\\". One night, Sam receives an email, from an unknown person, with an attached picture of Sonya. However, upon closer view, a few clues were hidden in the emailed picture. After writing down all four clues (\\"The Black Rock\\", \\"Christiane I\\", \\"Sunda Trench\\", and \\"Tell No-One - Grave Consequences\\"), Sam replies to the unknown source, and then receives a garbled response with a hidden website in it (\\"The-maxwell-group.com\\"). Sam emails his friend Tracy to find out more about the four clues. The Black Rock was an old 19th century slaving ship that was mysteriously lost in the South Indian Ocean with 40 crew aboard. However, the ship was last seen leaving port in an easterly direction, when it should have been sailing to the west. But, more relevant to Sam, there is a boat called the Christiane I leaving Jakarta for the Sunda Trench. Sam decides that he needs to get on that boat. = Chapter 2 = On January 7, 2008, Chapter 2 began. Sam has followed the mysterious email message from the Maxwell Group to Jakarta and has located the Christiane I. It is just about to embark on an expedition to the Sunda Trench. In order to secure a seat for himself, he must prove himself to the captain, Mr. Ockham. A man named Talbot tells Captain Ockham that this is not acceptable. Talbot begins to question Sam about his interest in the Sunda Trench, but Sam tells him he's just looking to get away on a trip. Ockham asks why Talbot is questioning Sam, and Talbot responds that his employers know a great deal about Ockham and his crew and that they have too much at stake to risk any surprises. Talbot questions Sam further, indicating knowledge of a girlfriend, and suggests that Sam is running away from something. Sam is unnerved. Ockham tells Talbot that they need Sam aboard, as their destination could be hazardous to the electrical equipment. Talbot consents, but says that he will install security measures. Later on in his berth, Sam begins to play with an old radio. In the static, Sam hears an old newscast detailing that radio communications with Amelia Earhart had been lost and that her last transmission had been \\"this morning\\" at 8:43.

The first Mud Festival was staged in 1998 and, by 2007, the festival attracted 2.2 million visitors to Boryeong. The mud is taken from the Boryeong mud flats, and trucked to the Daecheon beach area, where it is used as the centrepiece of the 'Mud Experience Land'. The mud is considered rich in minerals and used to manufacture cosmetics. The festival was originally conceived as a marketing vehicle for Boryeong mud cosmetics. Although the festival takes place over a period of around two weeks, it is most famous for its final weekend, which is popular with Korea's western population. The final weekend of the festival is normally on the second weekend in July. History In 1996 a range of cosmetics was produced using mud from the Boryeong mud flats. The cosmetics were said to be full of minerals, bentonites, and germaniums, all of which occur naturally in the mud from the area. In order to promote these cosmetics, the Boryeong Mud Festival was conceived. Through this festival, it was hoped people would learn more about the mud and the cosmetics. Attractions For the period of the festival several large attractions are erected in the seafront area of Daecheon. These include a mud pool, mud slides, mud prison and mud skiing competitions. Colored mud is also produced for body painting. A large stage is erected on the beach, which is used for live music, competitions and various other visual attractions. A small market runs along the seafront selling cosmetics made using the mud from Boryeong. Various health and beauty clinics offer massages, acupuncture and other treatments utilising the medicinal qualities of the mud. The festival is closed with a large firework display.

However, that one line does utilize the melody of Stephen Foster's song.

Return yards is a gridiron football statistical measure that takes several forms. In American and Canadian football, progress is measured by advancing the football towards the opposing team's goal line. Progress can be made during play by the offensive team by advancing the ball from its point of progress at the start of play known as the line of scrimmage or by the defensive team after taking possession of the football via a change of possession (such as punt, kickoff, interception, punt block, blocked kick or fumble). When the defensive team advances the ball during play after a change in possession, yardage is credited from the point of the change of possession. Return specialists are commonly monitored statistically for their totals and averages. However, other types of return yardage such as interception return yards are also measured because the point on the field where a change in possession occurs is marked. Kick return yards and punt return yards result from voluntary change in possession and most of the others result from involuntary forms of change in possession known as turnovers. Often kick return and punt return statistics are aggregated. and sometimes they are added to yards from scrimmage to yield all-purpose yards. When kick return yards and punt return yards are aggregated they are known as combined return yards or more formally, combined kick return yards.

It is made up of several once interconnected towers north of Herne Bay and is 14.8 km (9.2 miles) from the nearest land. They can be viewed from Shoeburyness East Beach on clear days. The Shivering Sands fort was the last of the Thames estuary forts to be constructed, and was grounded between 18 September and 13 December 1943.  History  The towers were built on land and floated out in 1943. Later in the war, the equipment was replaced, and removed soon after. The forts were abandoned in 1958. In the 1960s, some weather equipment was installed in the searchlight tower. On 7 June 1963, a boat called the Ribersborg collided with one of the towers, which fell into the sea without harming anyone or sinking the boat. In 1964 Screaming Lord Sutch set up Radio Sutch (a pirate radio station) on one of the old towers. However, he soon became bored and handed the project to his friend and unpaid manager Reginald Calvert, who then expanded into all five towers that were still connected and called it Radio City. After Calvert was killed by Oliver Smedley, his wife took over for a short time before the project was closed by legislation and the towers again abandoned. In 1990, the top of the searchlight tower was cut away so that helicopters could be used to maintain the weather equipment inside. In 1992, it was decided that the tower was no longer necessary for the continued operation of the instruments contained within, and a large buoy was placed next to the tower for the same purpose. In August and September 2005, artist Stephen Turner spent six weeks living alone in the searchlight tower of the Shivering Sands Fort, in what he described as \\"an artistic exploration of isolation, investigating how one's experience of time changes in isolation, and what creative contemplation means in a 21st-century context\\".

Biography = Education as a Harpist= By a recommendation of Nicanor Zabaleta she was accepted as a student by Italian harpist Liana Pasquali. After her participations in international competitions, Ravnopolska- Dean was invited to continue her studies by Susann McDonald at Juilliard School, New York and at Indiana University, Bloomington. At the Indiana University School of Music, Anna-Maria was awarded an Artist Diploma for 'Superior Artistic Achievement in Harp Performance'. When asked about her education as a harpist Ravnopolska-Dean highlights that both of her major professors were students of the French harp school: Liana Pasqualli was a student of Marcel Tournier, while Susann McDonald was a student of Henriette Renie. = Performing Career = Ravnopolska-Dean began her career as a soloist at the international stage in a series of notable international competitions, including those of Gargilesse in Berry, Munich, and Jerusalem, where she was first noticed by renowned names such as Nicanor Zabaleta and Susann McDonald. During her education in Juilliard School and Indiana University, Bloomington, she was presented on the McGraw-Hill Young Artists Showcase of WXQR radio in New York. The invitation came after a committee from the program recognized her talent in the Artist Diploma recordings at Indiana. After a competition in 1991 the North Carolina Arts Council appointed her Artist in Residence. In 1992, Ravnopolska-Dean made her New York début at Carnegie Hall's Weill Recital Hall. Her repertoire at Carnegie Hall included some rarely performed virtuoso pieces, such as the J. S. Bach violin Partita No. 3. She later debuted in various prestigious halls throughout Europe, among others in Salle Poirel, Nancy and Gasteig, Munich. Throughout her career she has participated in many World Harp Congresses, including those in Vienna, Copenhagen, Seattle. At the Eighth World Harp Congress, Geneva, she played the first harp in an ensemble of six harps and had a separate solo performance despite suffering partial paralysis of her left hand. In Bulgaria, Ravnopolska-Dean introduced the audience to a wide range of solo harp repertoire and harp and chamber music. Her performances inspired a series of Bulgarian composers including Lazar Nikolov, Dimitar Sagaev, Dora Draganova to write pieces for harp and chamber ensembles including harp. Simeon Pironkoff wrote for her a piece for her Carnegie Hall debut. Throughout 8 years composer Dimiter Christoff wrote 24 Preludes for Harp dedicated to the harpist and performed by her. Later Christoff assigned Ravnopolska-Dean to represent him as a sole performer at his 75-th Jubilee Celebration of his career as a composer. She hosted a series of TV shows about classical harp music, where she also performed a broad repertoire. In June 2008, she became the first Bulgarian to perform Carl Reinecke’s Harp Concerto with Vidin Philharmonic and Hans Peter Ochsenhofer. In addition to her harp performances, Ravnopolska-Dean also has been active as perfomer on piano and Paraguayan Harp. She is among the first, or the first to introduce the instrument to the Eastern European audience. She has also played concerts of her compostions on different celtic harps, the Finnish instrument kantele and piano. Anna-Maria Ravnopolska-Dean with her kantele,her grand concert, Irish and Paraguayan harp = Composer = Before being active as a composer, Ravnopolska-Dean arranged various pieces for harp including Isaac Albeniz’s Suita Espanol (1988), Enrique Granados’s Valses Poeticos and Parashkev Hadjiev’s Twelve Pieces in Bulgarian Rhythm (1995). In 2003, Ravnopolska-Dean wrote her first composition \\"Improvisation\\" for solo harp. The piece was influenced by Bulgarian folk music. She was invited as a special guest performer and lecturer at the international folk harp conference HarpCon in Bloomington, Indiana: she was the only classical harpist at the HarpCon program. To honor the conference Ravnopolska-Dean decided to write the piece. Later she wrote a series of compositions for harp based on Haiku poetry in collaboration with haiku poet Ginka Bilyarska. Follow compositions for harp and voice, harp and flute, piano, piano four hands. In 2010, string quartet “Hors” performs her first string quartet “Istvan”. Gradually the focus of her compositions starts to gravitate towards popular genres, as documented by her piano and pieces. Her interest in Jazz manifests itself in her Jazz trio “Just Like This’’ (piano, saxophone and percussions) as well as „Circus“ for Jazz Band, performed by Blagoevgrad Jazz Band. = Academic and Theoretical Career = In 1991, Anna-Maria Ravnopolska-Dean became one of the founders of the American University in Bulgaria. At the university, she is professor of Music and teaches applied courses on the harp and the piano, as well as different theoretical courses on topics such as Latin American and Jazz music. In her tv shows, besides playing, she also introduced the audience to different aspects of classical music and music periods, such as romanticism. In 2002 she was awarded a Ph. D. in Music on the dissertation The Harp as A Coloristic Instrument in the beginning of the 20th Century, where among others she explored impressionist composers and their use of the harp In 2008 students of hers played the full version of the Tchaikovsky seasons for first time on the Balkan peninsula.

In 1940, Oregon State had finished 5–3–1 and third in the PCC, the Beavers' third consecutive third-place finish. They opened 1941 with a last minute 13–7 loss at USC. A 9–6 win over Washington set OSC on the path to the conference championship. The Beavers next played the defending national champion and #2 Stanford Indians in California. The Indians were nicknamed the Wow Boys, because they implemented the seldom-used T-formation, forerunner to the modern football offense. Oregon State shut out Stanford, 10-0, snapping the Indians 13-game winning streak, but were shut out against eventual runner-up Washington State 7–0. The Beavers then shut out Idaho, UCLA, California, and Montana in consecutive weekends, outscoring the four a combined 85–0.

Oregon State compiled the 7–2 record despite only scoring 20 points twice, against Idaho and Montana. The Beavers' defense only gave up 33 points all year, less than four points per game. Oregon State was led by Lon Stiner; at age 38, he became the youngest head coach in Rose Bowl history. =Duke= Pacific Coast champion Oregon State was responsible for selecting and inviting the opposing team. Top-ranked Minnesota was the first choice, but the Western Conference (today's Big Ten Conference) did not permit their teams to play in bowl games until the 1946 agreement between the Big Nine and PCC. Duke was a logical second choice, but Coach Wallace Wade had rubbed a lot of Californians the wrong way due to his antics following his 7–3 loss in the 1939 Rose Bowl.

After a long night of deliberation Oregon State College yesterday announced Duke University had been invited and accepted the bid to play the Beavers in the 27th annual Rose Bowl classic at Pasadena on New Year's Day. Oregon State responded by inviting Fordham, who they had beaten in their 1933 Ironmen year. Unknown to Oregon State, both Fordham and Missouri had received take-it-or-leave-it offers from the Sugar Bowl before their invite to the Rose Bowl, and each had accepted the offer.

Venue change to Durham, North Carolina With the United States' entry into World War II following the Pearl Harbor attack on December 7, 1941, there was concern about a Japanese attack on the West Coast of the United States. Much discussion focused on the possibility of an attack where any crowds might gather. The Rose Parade and its estimated one million spectators, as well as the Rose Bowl with 90,000 spectators, were presumed to be ideal targets for the Japanese. On December 14, Lieutenant General John L.

On December 16, Duke University invited the game and Oregon State to Duke's home stadium in Durham, North Carolina.Zimmerman, Paul - Scene of Rose Bowl Shifted to Durham, N.C. Los Angeles Times, December 16, 1941. Perpetuation of the annual Rose Bowl intersectional football, classic was assured yesterday when the Tournament of Roses officials and Oregon State College accepted the hospitality of Duke University. At the time, Duke Stadium was the second-largest in the South but its seating capacity was just 35,000. In order to accommodate the larger crowd expected for the Rose Bowl, bleachers were brought in from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Kenan Stadium and North Carolina State University's Riddick Stadium to seat an additional 20,000 people. All 56,000 tickets sold out to the game in three days. Bing Crosby reportedly bought 271 tickets. It is unclear whether Crosby attended the game. Although Duke generally reserved a small segregated block of tickets for African-Americans, Duke initially decided to not allow African-Americans to attend. After an article in Durham's African-American newspaper, the Carolina Times, claimed that Duke would sell tickets to Japanese-Americans but not African-Americans, Duke reversed its decision and, despite the game already having officially sold out, released 140 tickets to African-American fans. Oregon State's Beaver Express train left Corvallis with 31 players on December 19, just three days after Duke University invited Oregon State. Standing on the platform in Corvallis was Chiaki \\"Jack\\" Yoshihara. Yoshihara had immigrated to the United States of America at the age of three on the last ship allowed into the United States before the United States put a moratorium on Japanese immigration. By executive order, no Japanese-Americans were permitted to go more than from their homes. Multiple FBI agents informed Oregon State coach, Lon Stiner that no exception would be made for Yoshihara. Teammates, students, the acting Oregon State president, and the campus ROTC commandant protested the decision to no avail. Yoshihara, the Beavers' 32nd player, watched the Beaver Express leave Corvallis from the platform without him on it. In Omaha, Nebraska, members of the University of Nebraska's N Club gave Stiner a good luck horseshoe. Three days after leaving Corvallis, the Beaver Express arrived in Chicago on December 22. The University of Chicago had dropped its football program after the 1939 season, so Oregon State used their Stagg Field. The train with the Beavers' equipment and uniforms did not arrive by practice time, so Oregon State players wore maroon warmups borrowed from the University of Chicago during kicking and passing drills. The equipment and uniform train arrived just in time for Martin Chaves, Bob Dethman, Donald Durdan, and Joe Day to dress in full pads for press pictures. Oregon State left Chicago on December 22, and on the way to Durham, they stopped in Washington, D.C. for practice at Griffith Stadium, home of the Washington Redskins and Senators, and a tour of the nation's capital. The Beaver Express finally arrived in Durham on December 24, five days after leaving Corvallis. To simulate Oregon State, Duke practiced against what Brian Curtis of Sports Illustrated later called \\"the most talented scout team in the country.\\" It included Duke graduate George McAfee of the Chicago Bears to simulate Oregon State's Donald Durdan, as well as Duke graduate Jap Davis and North Carolina State senior Dick Watts. On New Year's Day in Pasadena, the Rose Bowl Court and Queen, all clad in regular street clothes, drove down a deserted Colorado Boulevard, and later to a reception at the Huntington Hotel.Kowsky, Kim – Parade Passed Her By : In 1942, a Rose Princess Could Only Wave Goodby [sic] to Her Dreams. Los Angeles Times, December 27, 1992. Game summary Duke was expected to win by more than two touchdowns and went off as a 4–1 favorite. Some wondered why Oregon State would even make the trip. Before the game, the NBC announcer that called the game, Bill Stern, asserted that the Blue Devils could beat the Beavers by throwing 11 helmets on the field. The comment was heard by members of the Oregon State team at the hotel. After the game, George Zellick told reporters that the team was \\"hopped up\\" to win the game based on Stern's comment. The weather, also, seemed to favor the visitors. One Duke player claimed that there was more rain than he had ever seen. The Beavers' Gene Gray, looking up at the same sky, described the weather as \\"misty.\\" The temperature was a hair over at kickoff. The referee that was supposed to handle the opening coin flip was Lee Eisan. Eisan was the second-string quarterback for the 1929 Cal Golden Bears, who lost the Rose Bowl 8–7 to Georgia Tech after Roy \\"Wrong Way\\" Riegels ran 69 yards the wrong direction to set up the game-winning Georgia Tech safety. Eisan made a less often talked about blunder. In the third quarter, trailing 8–0, California ran an end around pass on fourth down. The end around sucked all of the Georgia Tech defenders in. Eisan used the misdirection to get behind the defenders and might have scored a touchdown but fell down and failed to make the catch. Eisan could not find a silver dollar in North Carolina, so he borrowed a 50-cent piece from Oregon State's Martin Chaves. The Blue Devils won the toss and elected to receive. Before kickoff, there was a moment of silence to honor those lost at Pearl Harbor 25 days before. Oregon State's Norman Peters kicked the opening kickoff. Duke's Tommy Davis collected the ball at his own five- yard line. He was crushed by the Beavers' Lloyd Wickett and two other Beavers and fumbled. Oregon State recovered inside the Blue Devil 30. The Duke defense would hold. The teams traded possession most of the first quarter. On third- and-six at the Blue Devil 15, Oregon State's Donald Durdan went back to pass. With no receiver open, he pump faked and took off to his right with nothing in front of him but the end zone to put the Beavers up 7–0. In the second quarter, Duke would tie the score at seven with a four-yard run on a reverse by Steve Lach. Oregon State's ensuing drive resulted in an interception at the 46, which was returned to the Beaver 27. On third-and-nine, the Blue Devils had a wide open receiver behind the Beaver defense, but the pass was just beyond the receiver's outstretched fingertips and fell incomplete. Duke ultimately turned the ball over on downs. The Blue Devils would threaten again late in the first half after an Oregon State fumble gave Duke a first down at the Beaver 32. Two plays later, though, the Oregon State defense forced a fumble after a sack, which was recovered by the Beavers. As the half was coming to a close, Duke drove to the Oregon State 42. Two passes were dropped by Blue Devil receivers. The third was caught at the Beaver 10 and advanced to the Beaver 5. However, Duke was unable to get a subsequent play off before halftime, and the teams entered the locker rooms tied 7–7. The head coach for Oregon State, Lon Stiner, gave an impassioned halftime speech, which was interrupted by an inebriated fan looking to urinate in the Beaver locker room. Oregon State took the second half kickoff. After a first down, the Beavers punted. Duke drove to the Beaver 28. On first down, the Blue Devils ran a double reverse and lost 12 yards. After an incomplete pass, the Oregon State defense forced a sack, which ended the threat. The Duke punt rolled out of bounds at the 15. The Beavers drove 73 yards to the Blue Devil 12 before getting pushed back to the Duke 15. Oregon State's 33-yard field goal attempt was no good. The Beavers' defense pushed the Blue Devils back to their own nine. On third down, Duke quick kicked, and the Beavers started their next drive at their own 46. The defenses, which played brilliantly for most of the game let down for the subsequent three-drive stretch. Oregon State retook the lead when Zellick scored on a 31-yard pass from Bob Dethman, set up by a 24-yard Gene Gray run. Duke would respond on the very next drive, getting 39 yards on a Lach reverse around left end before scoring on a one-yard run by Winston Siegfried three plays later. The Blue Devils' coach, Wallace Wade, who had won the 1926 Rose Bowl while at Alabama after a comeback against Washington, remarked to an assistant that, \\"It looks like 1926 all over again.\\" 1942 would play out differently than 1926. In the following drive, Bob Dethman found streaking reserve halfback, Gene Gray, on a 33-yard pass. The Duke safety would just miss making a play on the ball. Gray faked inside and went outside, which confused Moffatt Storer, the Blue Devil cornerback, so badly that he fell down. The Duke safety on the far side of the field took a good angle, but Gray was simply too fast and outran the safety the final 35 yards into the end zone. The 68-yard pass play was the longest in Rose Bowl history and would remain the longest pass play for more than 20 years. The extra point would be blocked, leaving the door open for a Duke comeback. The 20 points that Oregon State scored were the most scored on the Blue Devils since 1930, they year before Wade became head football coach. It was the most points scored against a Wade-coached team since 1928. The 14 points that Duke scored were the most that the Oregon State's defense had given up all year. The Beaver defense seemed resolved to make sure the 20-points the offense had put up would stand up. Duke's offense would cross into Beaver territory three times in the fourth-quarter, but the Beavers would not break, intercepting two passes and shutting out the Duke offense the rest of the way. After a Duke punt went out of bounds at the Oregon State three, the Beavers opted to quick kick. However, Durden mishandled the snap. Rather than attempting the punt, Durden tried to advance the ball out of the end zone, but Mike Karmazin caught Durden before Durden was able to do so for a safety. The Blue Devils ensuing drive ended on a fumble at the Beaver 29. What appeared to be a great Oregon State return was nullified by an inadvertent whistle. Duke's last drive began on its own 26. After a 28-yard pass play gave the Blue Devils a first down at the Beaver 46, Duke hurled two passes toward the Beaver end zone both broken up by Oregon State defenders, one inside the Beaver 10. On the final play of the game, the Beavers' Dethman came up with a game-saving interception. The Beavers won 20–16. =Scoring= First quarter *OSC – Donald Durdan 15-yard run (Simas kick) 7:26 7-0 OSC Second quarter *DUKE – Steve Lach 4-yard run (Gantt kick) 3:32 7-7 tie Third quarter *OSC – George Zellick 31-yard pass from Bob Dethman (Simas kick) 11:03 14-7 OSC *DUKE – Winston Siegfried 1-yard run (Gantt kick) 6:15 14-14 tie *OSC – Gene Gray 68-yard pass from Bob Dethman (kick failed) 0:25 20-14 OSC Fourth quarter *DUKE – Safety, Donald Durdan tackled in the end zone by Mike Karmazin 8:34 20-16 OSC Aftermath Donald Durdan, who showed his all-around skill by rushing for 54 yards and a touchdown, passing, and punting, was named the game's most valuable player. Bob Dethman also distinguished himself by throwing for two touchdowns and coming up with the interception that ended the game. The 1942 Rose Bowl remains the only Beavers' Rose Bowl victory. It also remains the only time the two programs have played each other. Had Duke not appeared in the 1933 game, they would've been the only invitee to the Rose Bowl game to have never played in Pasadena. Although many others argue that Columbia's 1934 victory over Stanford was bigger, Sid Feder of the Associated Press labeled it the biggest upset in the Rose Bowl's early history. Navy's head coach Major Swede Larson attended the game. At halftime, he was heard to remark that Oregon State was the hardest-hitting team that Duke had played all year. Referee Lee Eisan, who borrowed a 50-cent piece from Oregon State's Martin Chaves to conduct the coin flip, made it back to Berkeley, California with Chaves' 50-cent piece in hand, upset that he had failed to return the coin. The East–West Shrine Game has been played after every college football season since 1925. The game started in San Francisco, California and, prior to 2006, would be played in the Bay Area every year, except for two years. The first year outside of the Bay Area was 1942. As a result of the prohibition against playing football in West Coast stadiums, the East–West Shrine Game was moved to New Orleans, Louisiana. The West's coach was Washington State's Billy Sewell. A little more than two months prior, Sewell and the Cougars had dealt the Beavers the Beavers' largest loss of the year, a 7–0 decision in Pullman, Washington. The Beaver Express left Durham and stopped in New Orleans for the game on January 3, 1942. The game ended in a 6–6 tie. Many were concerned that the East–West Shrine Game would be the last football game \\"in a generation.\\" On the way back to Corvallis, Oregon State was able to visit the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. By the time the Beaver Express arrived home, the team had traveled 7,384 miles, through 24 states. After the 1942 Allied victory in the Battle of Midway and the end of the Japanese offensives in the Pacific Theater during 1942, it was deemed that the West Coast was no longer vulnerable to attack, and the Rose Bowl game continued on in the Rose Bowl Stadium. Most of the players would don military uniforms during 1942. Wallace Wade enlisted after the game ended and encouraged his players to follow suit. Of the 31 players on the Beaver Express, 29 would serve in World War II. Both teams lost halfbacks in the Pacific Theater in 1942, Walter Griffith of Duke and Everett Smith of Oregon State. Al Hoover of Duke lost his life on Peleliu in 1944 after diving on a grenade to save his fellow soldiers. The Blue Devils' Bob Nanni was killed at Iwo Jima. Jack Yoshihara listened to the game on NBC radio. He tried to enlist but was repeatedly denied. Once Japanese- American internment camps began popping up in the Western United States, he sold his prized 1941 Chevrolet. He spent most of 1942 in an internment camp in Idaho. Tommy Prothro, who was later the head coach of Oregon State and UCLA in successive Rose Bowls, played quarterback for the Blue Devils. Prothro's backup, Charlie Haynes, and Oregon State left guard, Frank Parker (himself the starting quarterback on the 1940 Beaver team), were rifle platoon leaders in different companies, sailing from Africa to Italy in 1944, when the two recognized each other. In the fall, Parker found Haynes with a fist-sized wound in his chest during the Arno Valley Campaign. Haynes had been injured 17 hours before and believed that he was going to die. Parker saved Haynes' life by carrying him on his back to an abandoned farmhouse for medical attention. In 1945, during the Battle of the Bulge, Oregon State right tackle, Stan Czech, shared some coffee and food with a fellow soldier who had not eaten in two days. Czech soon recognized the soldier as Duke coach, Wallace Wade. Czech was taken prisoner days later and interned at OFLAG XIII-B. He managed to escape but was recaptured the next day and interned at a prison deeper inside Germany. By the time he was freed, after nearly six months in captivity, Czech had lost . Duke Stadium, the site of the game, was later named Wallace Wade Stadium in honor of the Duke coach. Oregon State's Gene Gray flew more than 30 bombing missions over Germany and continued to serve after the war. In 1948, his plane crashed after a flameout on takeoff in the jungles of Panama. He later likened his body to burnt steak. He had severe burns over most of his body and both his arms had to be amputated. Gray, whose arms hauled in the touchdown catch which proved the deciding margin, wound up with no arms at all. The last surviving player who played in the game was Jim Smith, who played for Duke. Smith died in 2019 at age 98. As of February 2017, the last surviving Oregon State player, who made the trip to Durham, is reserve halfback Andy Landforce, age 100. Landforce only had three carries in 1941 and did not play in the 1942 Rose Bowl game. Instead, Landforce worked as a spotter for Bill Stern as a part of Stern's national radio broadcast of the game.Carlson, Kip.

Forming on October 30 from a mid-latitude cyclone in the north Pacific mid-latitudes, it moved over waters warmer than normal. The system acquired some features more typical of subtropical and even tropical cyclones. However, as it neared western North America, the system fell apart, dissipating soon after landfall, on November 4. Moisture from the storm's remnants caused substantial rainfall in British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest. The exact status and nature of this weather event is unknown, with meteorologists and weather agencies having differing opinions. Meteorological history On October 28, 2006, a cut-off extratropical cyclone over the central north Pacific moved over an area of ocean with sea surface temperatures as high as 2 °C above normal, at 16 – 18 °C (60.8 – 64.4 °F), and stalled there for two days. By October 31, the system had acquired convection, a warmer-than-normal core, and an eye-like feature. During this time it had moved east, then northeast, and then northwest. On November 1, the system reached its peak intensity, and had estimated winds of 100 km/h (60 mph) and its most developed convection. After that, it slowly weakened, looped counter-clockwise, and headed east towards the west coast of North America. This system's center of circulation passed south of observation buoy 46637 on November 1. The buoy's lowest pressure reading was 989 mbar. Other buoys indicated that a rather large area of low pressure was associated with the system. Buoy 46637 was not at the system's center of circulation, so it is possible that this system had a lower minimum pressure than was actually measured. On November 2, wind shear started taking its toll, and all convection was gone by the next day, when the storm was located roughly 520 mi (840 km) off the coast of Oregon. On November 3, the storm made landfall on the Olympic Peninsula in the State of Washington, bringing tropical storm-like conditions to the Pacific Northwest, including sustained winds at 40 mph and wind gusts up to 60 mph. Following its landfall, the storm rapidly weakened and dissipated on the next day. Impact, preparation, and records In response to the weather system, the American National Weather Service issued wind watches for the Oregon Coast. The system brought heavy rain to portions of Vancouver Island. If Storm 91C is considered a tropical or subtropical cyclone, it holds several records. Since the storm is not official, its holding of these records is unofficial. Since it formed at 36°N, this system formed at the northernmost latitude of any cyclone in the eastern north Pacific basin. The previous record-holder was Tropical Storm Wene, which formed at 32°N before crossing the dateline. In addition, this system's track data indicated that it crossed from the central to the east Pacific as it formed at longitude 149°W and dissipated at 135°W. Only two recorded other tropical cyclones had done this previously. Nature of the system Washington on November 3 This system has been considered a tropical, subtropical, or extratropical cyclone. Mark Guishard, a meteorologist with Bermuda Weather Service, was of the opinion that the system had completed tropical cyclogenesis and was a tropical cyclone. Meteorologist Mark Lander thought that cloud tops were similar to several Atlantic hurricanes, Hurricane Vince in particular. James Franklin, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center, said: > The system was of frontal origin... the frontal structure was eventually > lost.... The convective structure resembled a tropical, rather than > subtropical cyclone, and the radius of maximum winds (based on QuikSCAT) was > very close to the center, also more typical of tropical cyclones... on > balance, it was more tropical than subtropical. Clark Evans of Florida State University reported that forecasting tools showed that the system's structure was consistent with that of a subtropical or marginally tropical cyclone. NASA, a non-meteorological government agency, asserted that the system was a subtropical cyclone. In its review of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season, the Canadian Hurricane Centre considered this to be an extratropical cyclone. Since this system had one-minute sustained winds of 100 km/h (65 mi/h), which are above the 60 km/h (39 mi/h) boundary between a depression and a storm, it would qualify as a named storm if it was a tropical or subtropical cyclone. However, neither of the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers for the eastern north Pacific, the National Hurricane Center and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center, include this system in their annual archives, nor is it included in the official \\"best track\\" file. Hence, this system is not an official tropical or subtropical cyclone of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season.

Burg reached the highest rank ever attained by a Jew in the Prussian Army of the 19th century. However, his military career is also an example of the discrimination which was suffered by Jews who served the Prussian government.  Education and civilian career  '''' '''' Meno Burg was born into a Jewish family of poor circumstances in Berlin, Margraviate of Brandenburg. After visiting Jewish schools, Burg entered in December 1802 the Berlin Municipal School (German: '), a secondary school later known as '. He left the school in 1804 to become an apprentice to his cousin Salomo Sachs, a royal building inspector.Mein fünfzigjähriges Dienstleben und literarisches Wirken – Ich büße für meinen Glauben – Jüdische Memoiren, Band 3, Neu herausgegeben und kommentiert von Werner Heegewaldt und Oliver Sander in Verlag Hentrich&Henrich; Berlin 2005 He visited the Berlin Building Academy (German: '), where he finished in 1807 the exam as field- surveyor (German: '). Like his cousin who was the first Jew who had entered the Prussian civil service under Frederick William II, Burg became a civil servant under Frederick William III. In doing so, Burg had entered into a field which was outside of the professions Jews were allowed to enter in Prussia according to the prevailing regulations of the 'Revised General Concession and Regulation' (German: ') dated 17 April 1750. It appears that due to the political circumstances, the regulations governing the Jews in Prussia were not strictly followed. According to the legal situation at the time, Burg could have been denied to enter his chosen profession. Burg was already a government employee, when the new Prussian civil rights legislation for Jews (German: ') was enacted on 11 March 1812. This law naturalised Jewish inhabitants of Prussia as Prussian citizens, a franchise established in 1810 when doing away with the prior estates (nobility, serfs, burghers, Huguenots, etc.), but the admission to government positions was not called for and was reserved for future legislation.Edikt vom 11. März 1812 betreffend der bürgerlichen Verhältnisse der Juden in dem Preußischen Staate, as quoted in: Gesetzsammlung für die Königlich-Preußischen Staaten, Nr. 5, 1812, pp. 17  Enlistment in the Prussian Army during the War of Liberation  Akademie der Künste Burg was awaiting his final exam at the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin, when he volunteered on 14 February 1813 for the military service to fight for 'Prussia's freedom and rebirth', as he put it. The troop of his choice was the Guard Infantry Battalion (German: ') in Breslau, an elite unit of the infantry. After only a few days, he was discharged from this unit on the grounds that Jews were \\"under the existing laws and the prevailing circumstances\\" not allowed to serve in the Guard.q. v. letter to the Prussian Royal Government, in: Moritz Stern estate, P 17–418, in: The Central Archives for the History of the Jewish People, Jerusalem The rejection of Jewish soldiers in the Guard appears to have been a matter of course for the established circles. State Chancellor Karl August von Hardenberg, usually a supporter of equal rights for the Jews, left Burg's two requests for re- enlistment in the Guard unanswered.Moritz Stern Estate, p. 17–252. In: The Central Archives for the History of the Jewish People, Jerusalem Hereupon, Burg decided to apply for the artillery, a branch of the service which was considered less prestigious by the Prussian nobility and more suitable for the middle-classes. To avoid risking another discharge, Burg applied to the service chief of the artillery (German: '), Prince August of Prussia, who secured for him an admission. Since Burg's accomplishments were widely recognized, the lieutenants of his unit recommended him after just nine months of service to become an officer. However, the promotion was vetoed by the base commander (German: Platzkommandant) Captain Karl Moritz Ferdinand von Bardeleben, stating that \\"as long as (he) had something to say, no Jew shall be officer in the artillery\\". Consequently officer cadets, who had been trained by Burg, were promoted before him. Even his transfer to a combat unit did not help him to get promoted earlier. Only a mention of bravery could have accelerated his promotion, but his unit was not deployed to the front. Burg was not the first Prussian officer of Jewish faith. Other Prussian Jews had already become officers at the beginning of the war. They were soldiers in combat units who had been promoted during combat, or they belonged to the militia, the Free Corps (German: ')cp. or the Landwehr (National Guard). Burg became finally second lieutenant on 18 August 1815 and was transferred to the First Artillery Brigade (East Prussia) in Danzig as a company officer.  Officer during the Restoration  Vereinigte Artillerie- und Ingenieurschule Since 1816 as an instructor at the United Artillery and Engineer School (German: ') in Berlin, Burg's principal subject of instruction was drawing and geometry, on which science he wrote a text-book that attained great popularity, being frequently republished and translated into several languages. On 4 July 1826, Burg was promoted to first lieutenant, on time and according to his seniority. It is noteworthy that Burg received his promotion, while other Jewish volunteers, who claimed their legitimate rights to employment in the civil service, had been rejected because of their faith. Despite the highest protection by August Prince of Prussia, Burg nearly had not been promoted to the rank of a captain. In this promotion drama, Burg initially had to compromise to be promoted to the rank of a \\"captain of the army\\" only, a rank that was not equivalent to a captain of the artillery. Then he was invited to be baptized, to make the promotion possible, what Burg ultimately rejected. Burg requested the baptism once in 1824, but then he postponed his request \\"because of family relationships\\" on 16 November 1824.Jacob Jacobson, comments on the article by Carl Cohen: The Road to Conversion – Leo Baeck Institute Year Book VI (1961). In: Leo Baeck Institute Year Book VII (1962), p. 333 On 6 December 1830 Burg had to learn, that the King did not even want to appoint him to the rank of a captain of the army, because he had not attained \\"the salvation of the Christian faith\\". Burg's accomplishments in the service and the fact that he was a well-known book author and a respected military educator were not taken into consideration. Since it simply came down to discrimination based on his belief, Burg considered quitting the army. Completely unforeseen, he was finally promoted to the rank of a captain of the artillery, on time and according to his seniority. He could not, however, wear the uniform of the artillery, but only the uniform of an armory captain (German: '), a special branch in the Prussian army that ranked at the bottom.  Officer in the Pre-March Era  Zweiter Vereinigter Landtag (Second Prussian Parliament) in 1848 In the Pre-March Era it needed a new chief of the artillery, Prince Adalbert of Prussia, and a new king Frederick William IV to remove the injustice of the discriminatory ' (German for: \\"corps [or troop-function] color\\"). Through a cabinet order of 16 April 1844, Burg was allowed to replace the black epaulettes of the armory with the red epaulettes of the artillery. Order of the Red Eagle IV. Class That was not the end of the discrimination. As the rank and quarter lists of the Prussian Army show, Burg was passed over by others who had entered the service after him. On 27 March 1847, Burg was granted the \\"character of a Major in the artillery\\" (German: '). That was actually not a real promotion. His uniform showed to the outside that he was a major, but in reality he did not serve on an established post of a major. He did not receive the salary of a major and he was not \\"in line\\" for another promotion. That was the end of his military career. The grounds given, that Burg's post would have exceeded the budget for a field officer is not convincing. There were always two to three younger majors on fully paid positions at the school, younger officers without Burg's merits. The political circumstances did not allow Jews to enter into the Prussian government positions or to get promoted if they had already a government position. A typical example is what Otto von Bismarck said on 15 June 1847 in the ' (Prussian Parliament). He said that he would \\"give the Jews all rights, but not to hold positions of authority in a Christian State\\"; if he had to obey a Jew, he would feel \\"deeply depressed and knuckled down\\".Der Erste Vereinigte Landtag in Berlin 1847, Part Four, ed. by Eduard Bleich, Berlin 1847, pp. 1783 Burg had to endure similar experiences when it came to the award of military medals. Although he had been recommended since 1838 by the commander of the United Artillery and Engineer School for the Order of the Red Eagle (German: ') Class IV, it took more than three years until the medal was finally awarded to him by king Frederick William IV. The value of the medal can be explained with the fact that in the Artillery Brigade, which Burg belonged to until his promotion to captain, had been – at the moment of the award of the medal to Burg – under eighteen captains only one who had the medal and among the eight captains at his school, where he worked as an instructor, Burg was the only one.< It appears that the Prussian kings did not hesitate as much when it came to awarding civilian medals to Jews. Burg repeatedly received high civilian awards.  Devout Jew  Synagogue on Heidereutergasse, then the main synagogue in Berlin (seen in 1725) Burg was a devout Jew and participated actively in the Jewish community life. He served for many years on the board of the ' (cultural association) and on the board of the Auerbach orphanage. He was active on various committees in the Jewish congregation of Berlin and served for one year (1849–1850) as one of the elders on the board of the congregation. Burg resigned, when the board lost its legitimacy because it failed to comply with the General Concession for the Jews (German: ') dated 17 April 1750 and when the board decided to file a complaint with the court. As a royal officer, Burg did not want to share \\"the insubordination against the government\\".Report on the management of the Jewish Congregation in Berlin in the years 1849 to 1853 (German: '), reported by the board of directors (German: ') Berlin 1854, pp. 3Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums, dated 16 Dec 1850Aaron Hirsch Heymann, Lebenserinnerungen, Heinrich Loewe (ed.), Berlin 1909, p. 322 Burg tried to strictly separate between his government service and his religion. This proved to be nearly impossible, because both his government, which described itself as \\"Christian\\", as well as his congregation, who considered itself \\"orthodox\\", did not adhere to a strict separation between church and state. As a soldier, Burg was not able to strictly follow the Jewish ceremonial laws. That means that he had to disengage himself from a strict orthodoxy. In this respect, he is an example for a neo-orthodox, who felt that government service does not preclude the ceremonial law.  Loyal monarchist Prussian  Cholera barrack Burg described himself in his memoirs as a Prussian loyal to the crown and devoted to the king. Religiously he was rooted in Judaism. One did not exclude the other. He shared his political views and his patriotism with many in the educated German Jewish community, with whom he socially interacted, who wanted to assimilate into German society and who felt increasingly accepted. During the years 1847 to 1849 Burg was engaged in writing his autobiography, which was published in 1854 in Berlin under the title ' (\\"history of my life in service\\"). In the March Revolution of 1848, Wolfgang Straßmann and eight further revolutionaries sought refuge in Burg's house at Berlin's Poststrasse when their barricades were attacked by Prussian troops on 18 March 1848. Except of Straßmann, who hid in the bed of one of Burg's servant girls, all of them were executed on the spot. On 26 August 1853, Burg died as one of the first victims of the cholera epidemic. The funeral, which was conducted on 29 August with military honors, was a big event for the city of Berlin. The police estimated that about 60,000 people had gathered.Vossische Zeitung, dated 27 Aug. 1853, dated 28 Aug 1853, pp. 3, dated 30 Aug 1853, p. 8Kraft Prinz zu Hohenlohe- Ingelfingen, Aus meinem Leben, Vol. 1, Berlin 1897, pp. 222Berlin had a population of about 440,000 at that time.

It includes the site of a 1659 fort, a Revolutionary War-era fort, and a Civil War-era fort. The fort was named after Nathan Hale, Connecticut's official hero. Since 1921, the site has been owned by the state of Connecticut. It has been used as a park and maintained as a historical site by the City of New Haven. Educational programs are given throughout the year to students attending local schools. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. In 1970 the listing included three contributing buildings, one contributing site, and three contributing structures. and History In early 1776, the colony of Connecticut commissioned the construction of a fort on a point of rock that stretched out into the harbor to protect the port of New Haven from the British. This was the location of an earlier unnamed fort from circa 1657, and on this site was erected Black Rock Fort. Unfortunately for the colonists, in 1779 British General William Tryon, during his raid of Connecticut coastal communities, captured Black Rock Fort along with its nineteen defenders, but only after they had run out of ammunition. The British burned the barracks as they left. In 1807-1812, the abandoned fort was reconstructed with six guns as Fort Nathan Hale under the second system of US fortifications, and it served to defend the port from the British once again during the War of 1812.Roberts, p. 120Wade, p. 243 In 1863, Fort Nathan Hale II was built alongside the original fort, out of concern that Southern raiders might strike the city during the Civil War, but the fort saw no battle action.

Powder Magazine The site has been known as a historic site since 1921, when Congress deeded the fort to the State, which turned it over to the City to maintain. The site was turned into a popular bathing and picnic area but pollution and the hurricane of 1938 brought such recreation to an end. The site, neglected, became overgrown and the fort fell into decay. In 1967, the Fort Nathan Hale Restoration Project was founded by a group of concerned citizens interested in the restoration and preservation of Fort Nathan Hale. Brought back to life in time for the nation's bicentennial, Fort Nathan Hale was rededicated on July 5, 1976. Both Fort Nathan Hale and Black Rock Fort have been reconstructed and include a newly restored drawbridge, moat, ramparts, powder magazines and \\"bombproof\\" bunker. Through the efforts of FNHRP, funds are raised annually to maintain, staff and promote the facility. In addition to the reconstructed forts, the site features a memorial flag court with replicas of flags flown during the Colonial Era, the American Revolution, War of 1812, the Civil War, and today. The court also features a copy of the Nathan Hale statue by Bela Lyon Pratt that was dedicated at Yale University in 1914 (another copy of the statue stands outside CIA headquarters in Virginia).

Sleep is observed in mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and some fish, and, in some form, in insects and even in simpler animals such as nematodes. The internal circadian clock promotes sleep at night for diurnal organisms (such as humans) and in the day for nocturnal organisms (such as rodents). Sleep patterns vary widely among species. It appears to be a requirement for all mammals and most other animals. Definition Sleep can follow a physiological or behavioral definition. In the physiological sense, sleep is a state characterized by reversible unconsciousness, special brainwave patterns, sporadic eye movement, loss of muscle tone (possibly with some exceptions; see below regarding the sleep of birds and of aquatic mammals), and a compensatory increase following deprivation of the state, this last known as sleep homeostasis (i.e., the longer a waking state lasts, the greater the intensity and duration of the sleep state thereafter).Rechtschaffen A, Kales A (1968): A Manual of Standardised Terminology, Techniques and Scoring System of Sleep Stages of Human Subjects; Public Health Service, Government Printing Office, Washington. Iber C, Ancoli-Israel S, Chesson A Jr, Quan S (2007): AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events: Rules, Terminology and Technical Specification; American Association of Sleep Medicine. In the behavioral sense, sleep is characterized by minimal movement, non-responsiveness to external stimuli (i.e. increased sensory threshold), the adoption of a typical posture, and the occupation of a sheltered site, all of which is usually repeated on a 24-hour basis. The physiological definition applies well to birds and mammals, but in other animals (whose brain is not as complex), the behavioral definition is more often used. In very simple animals, behavioral definitions of sleep are the only ones possible, and even then the behavioral repertoire of the animal may not be extensive enough to allow distinction between sleep and wakefulness. Sleep is quickly reversible, as opposed to hibernation or coma, and sleep deprivation is followed by longer or deeper rebound sleep.  Necessity  If sleep were not essential, one would expect to find: * Animal species that do not sleep at all * Animals that do not need recovery sleep after staying awake longer than usual * Animals that suffer no serious consequences as a result of lack of sleep Outside of a few basal animals that have no brain or a very simple one, no animals have been found to date that satisfy any of these criteria. While some varieties of shark, such as great whites and hammerheads, must remain in motion at all times to move oxygenated water over their gills, it is possible they still sleep one cerebral hemisphere at a time as marine mammals do. However it remains to be shown definitively whether any fish is capable of unihemispheric sleep. Invertebrates Caenorhabditis elegans is among the most primitive organisms in which sleep-like states have been observed. A cuckoo bee from the genus Nomada, sleeping. Note the characteristic position anchored by the mandibles. Bees have some of the most complex sleep states amongst insects. Sleep as a phenomenon appears to have very old evolutionary roots. Unicellular organisms do not necessarily \\"sleep\\", although many of them have pronounced circadian rhythms. The jellyfish Cassiopea is among the most primitive organisms in which sleep-like states have been observed.Jellyfish caught snoozing give clues to origin of sleep : Nature News Observing sleep states in jellyfish provides evidence that sleep states do not require that an animal have a brain or central nervous system. The nematode C. elegans is another primitive organism that appears to require sleep. Here, a lethargus phase occurs in short periods preceding each moult, a fact which may indicate that sleep primitively is connected to developmental processes. Raizen et al.'s results furthermore suggest that sleep is necessary for changes in the neural system. The electrophysiological study of sleep in small invertebrates is complicated. Insects go through circadian rhythms of activity and passivity but some do not seem to have a homeostatic sleep need. Insects do not seem to exhibit REM sleep. However, fruit flies appear to sleep, and systematic disturbance of that state leads to cognitive disabilities. There are several methods of measuring cognitive functions in fruit flies. A common method is to let the flies choose whether they want to fly through a tunnel that leads to a light source, or through a dark tunnel. Normally, flies are attracted to light. But if sugar is placed in the end of the dark tunnel, and something the flies dislike is placed in the end of the light tunnel, the flies will eventually learn to fly towards darkness rather than light. Flies deprived of sleep require a longer time to learn this and also forget it more quickly. If an arthropod is experimentally kept awake longer than it is used to, then its coming rest period will be prolonged. In cockroaches that rest period is characterized by the antennae being folded down and by a decreased sensitivity to external stimuli. Sleep has been described in crayfish, too, characterized by passivity and increased thresholds for sensory stimuli as well as changes in the EEG pattern, markedly differing from the patterns found in crayfish when they are awake. In honeybees, it has been shown that they use sleep to store long term memories.BBC - Earth - Bees learn while they sleep, and that means they might dream Fish Alternating phases of sleep and activity in an adult zebrafish Sleep in fish is subject of current scientific research.Reebs, S. (1992) Sleep, inactivity and circadian rhythms in fish. pp. 127–135 in: Ali, M.A. (ed.), Rhythms in Fish, New York: Plenum Press. Typically fish exhibit periods of inactivity but show no significant reactions to deprivation of this condition. Some species that always live in shoals or that swim continuously (because of a need for ram ventilation of the gills, for example) are suspected never to sleep. There is also doubt about certain blind species that live in caves.Parzefall, J. (1993): Behavioural ecology of cave-dwelling fish; pp. 573–606 in: Pitcher, T.J. (ed.), The Behaviour of Teleost Fish; London: Chapman&Hall.; Other fish seem to sleep, however. For example, zebrafish, and criticism and rebuttal, at PLoS Biology tilapia, tench, brown bullhead, and swell shark become motionless and unresponsive at night (or by day, in the case of the swell shark); Spanish hogfish and blue-headed wrasse can even be lifted by hand all the way to the surface without evoking a response.Tauber, E.S., 1974, The phylogeny of sleep, pp. 133–172 in: Advances in sleep research, vol. 1 (E.D. Weitzman, ed.), Spectrum Publications, New York. A 1961 observational study of approximately 200 species in European public aquaria reported many cases of apparent sleep. On the other hand, sleep patterns are easily disrupted and may even disappear during periods of migration, spawning, and parental care. Land vertebrates  Mammals, birds and reptiles evolved from amniotic ancestors, the first vertebrates with life cycles independent of water. The fact that birds and mammals are the only known animals to exhibit REM and NREM sleep indicates a common trait before divergence. However, recent evidence of REM-like sleep in fish suggests this divergence may have occurred much earlier than previously thought. Up to this point, reptiles were considered the most logical group to investigate the origins of sleep. Daytime activity in reptiles alternates between basking and short bouts of active behavior, which has significant neurological and physiological similarities to sleep states in mammals. It is proposed that REM sleep evolved from short bouts of motor activity in reptiles while Slow-Wave Sleep (SWS) evolved from their basking state which shows similar slow wave EEG patterns. Reptiles and amphibians  Sleeping African dwarf Fischer's chameleon A Komodo dragon sleeping. Reptiles have quiescent periods similar to mammalian sleep, and a decrease in electrical activity in the brain has been registered when the animals have been asleep. However, the EEG pattern in reptilian sleep differs from what is seen in mammals and other animals. In reptiles, sleep time increases following sleep deprivation, and stronger stimuli are needed to awaken the animals when they have been deprived of sleep as compared to when they have slept normally. This suggests that the sleep which follows deprivation is compensatorily deeper. In 2016, a study reported the existence of REM- and NREM-like sleep stages in the Australian dragon Pogona vitticeps. Amphibians have periods of inactivity but show high vigilance (receptivity to potentially threatening stimuli) in this state. Birds There are significant similarities between sleep in birds and sleep in mammals, which is one of the reasons for the idea that sleep in higher animals with its division into REM and NREM sleep has evolved together with warm-bloodedness. Birds compensate for sleep loss in a manner similar to mammals, by deeper or more intense slow-wave sleep (SWS). Birds have both REM and NREM sleep, and the EEG patterns of both have similarities to those of mammals. Different birds sleep different amounts, but the associations seen in mammals between sleep and variables such as body mass, brain mass, relative brain mass, basal metabolism and other factors (see below) are not found in birds. The only clear explanatory factor for the variations in sleep amounts for birds of different species is that birds who sleep in environments where they are exposed to predators have less deep sleep than birds sleeping in more protected environments. A sleeping cockatiel A flamingo with at least one cerebral hemisphere awake Birds do not necessarily exhibit sleep debt, but a peculiarity that birds share with aquatic mammals, and possibly also with certain species of lizards (opinions differ about that last point), is the ability for unihemispheric sleep. That is the ability to sleep with one cerebral hemisphere at a time, while the other hemisphere is awake (Unihemispheric slow-wave sleep). When only one hemisphere is sleeping, only the contralateral eye will be shut; that is, when the right hemisphere is asleep the left eye will be shut, and vice versa. The distribution of sleep between the two hemispheres and the amount of unihemispheric sleep are determined both by which part of the brain has been the most active during the previous period of wake—that part will sleep the deepest—and it is also determined by the risk of attacks from predators. Ducks near the perimeter of the flock are likely to be the ones that first will detect predator attacks. These ducks have significantly more unihemispheric sleep than those who sleep in the middle of the flock, and they react to threatening stimuli seen by the open eye. Opinions partly differ about sleep in migratory birds. The controversy is mainly about whether they can sleep while flying or not. Theoretically, certain types of sleep could be possible while flying, but technical difficulties preclude the recording of brain activity in birds while they are flying. Mammals Sleeping Japanese macaques. Mammals have wide diversity in sleep phenomena. Generally, they go through periods of alternating non-REM and REM sleep, but these manifest differently. Horses and other herbivorous ungulates can sleep while standing, but must necessarily lie down for REM sleep (which causes muscular atony) for short periods. Giraffes, for example, only need to lie down for REM sleep for a few minutes at a time. Bats sleep while hanging upside down. Male armadillos get erections during non-REM sleep, and the inverse is true in rats. Early mammals engaged in polyphasic sleep, dividing sleep into multiple bouts per day. Higher daily sleep quotas and shorter sleep cycles in polyphasic species as compared to monophasic species, suggest that polyphasic sleep may be a less efficient means of attaining sleep's benefits. Small species with higher BMR may therefore have less efficient sleep patterns. It follows that the evolution of monophasic sleep may hitherto be an unknown advantage of evolving larger mammalian body sizes and therefore lower BMR. Sleep is sometimes thought to help conserve energy, though this theory is not fully adequate as it only decreases metabolism by about 5–10%.\\"Function of Sleep.\\". Scribd.com. Retrieved on 1 December 2011. Additionally it is observed that mammals require sleep even during the hypometabolic state of hibernation, in which circumstance it is actually a net loss of energy as the animal returns from hypothermia to euthermia in order to sleep. Nocturnal animals have higher body temperatures, greater activity, rising serotonin, and diminishing cortisol during the night—the inverse of diurnal animals. Nocturnal and diurnal animals both have increased electrical activity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and corresponding secretion of melatonin from the pineal gland, at night. Nocturnal mammals, which tend to stay awake at night, have higher melatonin at night just like diurnal mammals do.Fred W. Turek & Charles A. Czeisler (1999). \\"Role of Melatonin in the Regulation of Sleep\\", in Turek & Zee (eds.), Regulation of Sleep and Circadian Rhythms, pp. 181–195. And, although removing the pineal gland in many animals abolishes melatonin rhythms, it does not stop circadian rhythms altogether—though it may alter them and weaken their responsiveness to light cues.David R. Weaver (1999), \\"Melatonin and Circadian Rhythmicity in Vertebrates: Physiological Roles and Pharmacological Effects\\", in Turek & Zee (eds.), Regulation of Sleep and Circadian Rhythms, pp. 197–262. Cortisol levels in diurnal animals typically rise throughout the night, peak in the awakening hours, and diminish during the day.Eve Van Cauter & Karine Spiegel (1999). \\"Circadian and Sleep Control of Hormonal Secretions\\", in Turek & Zee (eds.), Regulation of Sleep and Circadian Rhythms, pp. 397–425.Thomas A. Wehr (1999). \\"The Impact of Changes in Nightlength (Scotoperiod) on Human Sleep\\", in Turek & Zee (eds.), Regulation of Sleep and Circadian Rhythms, pp. 263–285. In diurnal animals, sleepiness increases during the night. =Duration= Flying foxes, asleep Different mammals sleep different amounts. Some, such as bats, sleep 18–20 hours per day, while others, including giraffes, sleep only 3–4 hours per day. There can be big differences even between closely related species. There can also be differences between laboratory and field studies: for example, researchers in 1983 reported that captive sloths slept nearly 16 hours a day, but in 2008, when miniature neurophysiological recorders were developed that could be affixed to wild animals, sloths in nature were found to sleep only 9.6 hours a day. Sleeping polar bears As with birds, the main rule for mammals (with certain exceptions, see below) is that they have two essentially different stages of sleep: REM and NREM sleep (see above). Mammals' feeding habits are associated with their sleep length. The daily need for sleep is highest in carnivores, lower in omnivores and lowest in herbivores. Humans sleep less than many other omnivores but otherwise not unusually much or unusually little in comparison with other mammals. Many herbivores, like Ruminantia (such as cattle), spend much of their wake time in a state of drowsiness, which perhaps could partly explain their relatively low need for sleep. In herbivores, an inverse correlation is apparent between body mass and sleep length; big mammals sleep less than smaller ones. This correlation is thought to explain about 25% of the difference in sleep amount between different mammals. Also, the length of a particular sleep cycle is associated with the size of the animal; on average, bigger animals will have sleep cycles of longer durations than smaller animals. Sleep amount is also coupled to factors like basal metabolism, brain mass, and relative brain mass. The duration of sleep among species is also directly related to basal metabolic rate (BMR). Rats, which have a high BMR, sleep for up to 14 hours a day, whereas elephants and giraffes, which have lower BMRs, sleep only 3–4 hours per day. It has been suggested that mammalian species which invest in longer sleep times are investing in the immune system, as species with the longer sleep times have higher white blood cell counts. Mammals born with well-developed regulatory systems, such as the horse and giraffe, tend to have less REM sleep than the species which are less developed at birth, such as cats and rats. This appears to echo the greater need for REM sleep among newborns than among adults in most mammal species. Many mammals sleep for a large proportion of each 24-hour period when they are very young. The giraffe only sleeps 2 hours a day in about 5–15 minute sessions. Koalas are the longest sleeping-mammals, about 20–22 hours a day. However, killer whales and some other dolphins do not sleep during the first month of life.Insomnia Mania: Newborn Mammals Don't Sleep for a Month. LiveScience.com Instead, young dolphins and whales frequently take rests by pressing their body next to their mother's while she swims. As the mother swims she is keeping her offspring afloat to prevent them from drowning. This allows young dolphins and whales to rest, which will help keep their immune system healthy; in turn, protecting them from illnesses. mirror During this period, mothers often sacrifice sleep for the protection of their young from predators. However, unlike other mammals, adult dolphins and whales are able to go without sleep for a month. ;Comparative average sleep periods for various mammals (in captivity) over 24 hours A sleeping dog * Horses – 2 hours * Elephants – 3+ hours * Cows – 4.0 hours * Giraffes – 4.5 hours * Humans – 8.0 hours * Rabbits – 8.4 hours * Chimpanzees – 9.7 hours * Red foxes – 9.8 hours * Dogs – 10.1 hours * House mice – 12.5 hours * Cats – 12.5 hours * Lions – 13.5 hours * Platypuses – 14 hours * Chipmunks – 15 hours * Giant armadillos – 18.1 hours * Little brown bats – 19.9 hours Reasons given for the wide variations include the fact that mammals \\"that nap in hiding, like bats or rodents tend to have longer, deeper snoozes than those on constant alert.\\" Lions, which have little fear of predators also have relatively long sleep periods, while elephants have to eat most of the time to support their huge bodies. Little brown bats conserve their energy except for the few hours each night when their insect prey are available, and platypuses eat a high energy crustacean diet and, therefore, probably do not need to spend as much time awake as many other mammals.Holland, Jennifer S. \\"40 Winks?\\", National Geographic Vol. 220, No. 1, July 2011. =Rodents= A sleeping rat A study conducted by Datta indirectly supports the idea that memory benefits from sleep. A box was constructed wherein a single rat could move freely from one end to the other. The bottom of the box was made of a steel grate. A light would shine in the box accompanied by a sound. After a five-second delay, an electrical shock would be applied. Once the shock commenced, the rat could move to the other end of the box, ending the shock immediately. The rat could also use the five-second delay to move to the other end of the box and avoid the shock entirely. The length of the shock never exceeded five seconds. This was repeated 30 times for half the rats. The other half, the control group, was placed in the same trial, but the rats were shocked regardless of their reaction. After each of the training sessions, the rat would be placed in a recording cage for six hours of polygraphic recordings. This process was repeated for three consecutive days. During the posttrial sleep recording session, rats spent 25.47% more time in REM sleep after learning trials than after control trials. An observation of the Datta study is that the learning group spent 180% more time in SWS than did the control group during the post- trial sleep-recording session. This study shows that after spatial exploration activity, patterns of hippocampal place cells are reactivated during SWS following the experiment. Rats were run through a linear track using rewards on either end. The rats would then be placed in the track for 30 minutes to allow them to adjust (PRE), then they ran the track with reward-based training for 30 minutes (RUN), and then they were allowed to rest for 30 minutes. During each of these three periods, EEG data were collected for information on the rats' sleep stages. The mean firing rates of hippocampal place cells during prebehavior SWS (PRE) and three ten-minute intervals in postbehavior SWS (POST) were calculated by averaging across 22 track-running sessions from seven rats. The results showed that ten minutes after the trial RUN session, there was a 12% increase in the mean firing rate of hippocampal place cells from the PRE level. After 20 minutes, the mean firing rate returned rapidly toward the PRE level. The elevated firing of hippocampal place cells during SWS after spatial exploration could explain why there were elevated levels of slow-wave sleep in Datta's study, as it also dealt with a form of spatial exploration. In rats, sleep deprivation causes weight loss and reduced body temperature. Rats kept awake indefinitely develop skin lesions, hyperphagia, loss of body mass, hypothermia, and, eventually, fatal sepsis. Sleep deprivation also hinders the healing of burns on rats. When compared with a control group, sleep-deprived rats' blood tests indicated a 20% decrease in white blood cell count, a significant change in the immune system. A 2014 study found that depriving mice of sleep increased cancer growth and dampened the immune system's ability to control cancers. The researchers found higher levels of M2 tumor-associated macrophages and TLR4 molecules in the sleep deprived mice and proposed this as the mechanism for increased susceptibility of the mice to cancer growth. M2 cells suppress the immune system and encourage tumour growth. TRL4 molecules are signalling molecules in the activation of the immune system.Peres, Judy (14 March 2012) A good reason to get your zzz's Chicago Tribune Health, retrieved 26 March 2014 =Monotremes= Since monotremes (egg-laying mammals) are considered to represent one of the evolutionarily oldest groups of mammals, they have been subject to special interest in the study of mammalian sleep. As early studies of these animals could not find clear evidence for REM sleep, it was initially assumed that such sleep did not exist in monotremes, but developed after the monotremes branched off from the rest of the mammalian evolutionary line, and became a separate, distinct group. However, EEG recordings of the brain stem in monotremes show a firing pattern that is quite similar to the patterns seen in REM sleep in higher mammals. In fact, the largest amount of REM sleep known in any animal is found in the platypus. REM electrical activation does not extend at all to the forebrain in platypods, suggesting that they do not dream. The average sleep time of the platypus in a 24-hour period is said to be as long as 14 hours, though this may be because of their high-calorie crustacean diet. =Aquatic mammals= Northern sea lion pup with adult female and male, the largest of the eared seals. Habitat: the northern Pacific. The consequences of falling into a deep sleep for marine mammalian species can be suffocation and drowning, or becoming easy prey for predators. Thus, dolphins, whales, and pinnipeds (seals) engage in unihemispheric sleep while swimming, which allows one brain hemisphere to remain fully functional, while the other goes to sleep. The hemisphere that is asleep alternates, so that both hemispheres can be fully rested. Just like terrestrial mammals, pinnipeds that sleep on land fall into a deep sleep and both hemispheres of their brain shut down and are in full sleep mode. Aquatic mammal infants do not have REM sleep in infancy; REM sleep increases as they age. Among others, seals and whales belong to the aquatic mammals. Earless seals and eared seals have solved the problem of sleeping in water via two different methods. Eared seals, like whales, show unihemispheric sleep. The sleeping half of the brain does not awaken when they surface to breathe. When one half of a seal's brain shows slow-wave sleep, the flippers and whiskers on its opposite side are immobile. While in the water, these seals have almost no REM sleep and may go a week or two without it. As soon as they move onto land they switch to bilateral REM sleep and NREM sleep comparable to land mammals, surprising researchers with their lack of \\"recovery sleep\\" after missing so much REM. Cape fur seal, asleep in a zoo Earless seals sleep bihemispherically like most mammals, under water, hanging at the water surface or on land. They hold their breath while sleeping under water, and wake up regularly to surface and breathe. They can also hang with their nostrils above water and in that position have REM sleep, but they do not have REM sleep underwater. REM sleep has been observed in the pilot whale, a species of dolphin. Whales do not seem to have REM sleep, nor do they seem to have any problems because of this. One reason REM sleep might be difficult in marine settings is the fact that REM sleep causes muscular atony; that is to say, a functional paralysis of skeletal muscles that can be difficult to combine with the need to breathe regularly. Unihemispherism Unihemispheric sleep refers to sleeping with only a single cerebral hemisphere. The phenomenon has been observed in birds and aquatic mammals, as well as in several reptilian species (the latter being disputed: many reptiles behave in a way which could be construed as unihemispheric sleeping, but EEG studies have given contradictory results). Reasons for the development of unihemispheric sleep are likely that it enables the sleeping animal to receive stimuli—threats, for instance—from its environment, and that it enables the animal to fly or periodically surface to breathe when immersed in water. Only NREM sleep exists unihemispherically, and there seems to exist a continuum in unihemispheric sleep regarding the differences in the hemispheres: in animals exhibiting unihemispheric sleep, conditions range from one hemisphere being in deep sleep with the other hemisphere being awake to one hemisphere sleeping lightly with the other hemisphere being awake. If one hemisphere is selectively deprived of sleep in an animal exhibiting unihemispheric sleep (one hemisphere is allowed to sleep freely but the other is awoken whenever it falls asleep), the amount of deep sleep will selectively increase in the hemisphere that was deprived of sleep when both hemispheres are allowed to sleep freely. The neurobiological background for unihemispheric sleep is still unclear. In experiments on cats in which the connection between the left and the right halves of the brain stem has been severed, the brain hemispheres show periods of a desynchronized EEG, during which the two hemispheres can sleep independently of each other. In these cats, the state where one hemisphere slept NREM and the other was awake, as well as one hemisphere sleeping NREM with the other state sleeping REM were observed. The cats were never seen to sleep REM sleep with one hemisphere while the other hemisphere was awake. This is in accordance with the fact that REM sleep, as far as is currently known, does not occur unihemispherically. The fact that unihemispheric sleep exists has been used as an argument for the necessity of sleep. It appears that no animal has developed an ability to go without sleep altogether. Hibernation Animals that hibernate are in a state of torpor, differing from sleep. Hibernation markedly reduces the need for sleep, but does not remove it. Some hibernating animals end their hibernation a couple of times during the winter so that they can sleep. Hibernating animals waking up from hibernation often go into rebound sleep because of lack of sleep during the hibernation period. They are definitely well-rested and are conserving energy during hibernation, but need sleep for something else.

The aircraft was a conventional biplane with three- bay, unstaggered wings of equal span. The fuselage was a very advanced design for its day, incorporating careful streamlining of its monocoque structure, and offering the crew as well as the passengers a fully enclosed cabin. The Eagle is sometimes named as the first American tri-motor aircraft; however Curtiss' own Model H flying boat flew with three engines for a time in 1914 before being converted back to twin-engine configuration. Development Curtiss had developed the Eagle in preparation for an anticipated post-war boom in civil aviation. In fact, this boom was far smaller than Curtiss had been hoping for, and practically all of the demand for passenger aircraft was met by the conversion of war-surplus military aircraft that could be purchased extremely cheaply. As such, only around 20 machines were built. The original trimotor Eagle design was followed by a single example of the Eagle II, with twin engines, and by three Eagle IIIs with only one engine. These latter aircraft were purchased by the United States Army Air Service, which used them as staff transports and converted one example into an air ambulance.

As such, it was an early effort made by conservative Episcopal bishops and Continuing Anglican bishops to voice a common set of principles which might become the basis of future cooperation between their churches or dioceses. The schism that had divided these church bodies had occurred in 1977 at the Congress of St. Louis when \\"Continuers\\" met and formed a new Anglican church in reaction to changes in doctrine and practice that had been approved by The Episcopal Church and the Anglican Church of Canada. These bishops assembled in Bartonville, Illinois at Saint Benedict's Abbey. In his opening comments the host, Abbot Alberto Morales, encouraged those present \\"to let the Holy Spirit guide us and show us the way that we should go...that as we face the new millennium we may present to the world a portion of the Anglican Communion reconciled and united, which in turn, may be an example to imitate for all good and faithful Anglicans and for the Church in general.\\" The result of the meeting was the signing of a \\"Call to prayer\\" for unity and a determination to meet again.

He started again on another monoplane design, the Flanders F.2 powered by a 60 hp (45 kW) Green engine. The F.2 was a single-seat shoulder-wing monoplane. The wing as usual for the period was braced by wires and kingposts. It had a fixed tailskid landing gear with bicycle-type wheels and a central skid projecting forward from between the wheels. The central skid was to stop the aircraft nosing over on rough ground. It flew for the first time on 8 August 1911. Later in 1911 the aircraft was modified to include another cockpit forward of the pilot for a passenger. The wingspan was increased and the modified aircraft was re- designated the Flanders F.3. It flew successfully for a number of months until it was destroyed in a fatal accident on 13 May 1912 when Mr. E.V.B Fisher was piloting it with an American passenger Mr. Mason when it crashed at Brooklands killing them both.

It is open weekday mornings, but reservations must be made in advance and an admission fee is charged. The garden's site was formerly a royal palace built 1738-1748 by Charles III of Spain, King of Naples and Sicily. After the Bourbons' departure in 1860, today's gardens were founded in 1872 with the Royal Higher School of Agriculture. The park was enlarged by a further 36 hectares at that time, and two ornamental gardens (about 9000 square meters) created, which were then transformed into botanical gardens by Nicola Antonio Pedicino, the school's first botany professor. In 1935 the school became part of the University of Naples, and subsequently occupied by allied troops during World War II, destroying many plants, but from 1948 its collections have been restored and enlarged. The gardens currently contain over 4000 specimens representing about 1000 species. The most important collection are desert plants, which include over 600 species from Agavaceae, Aizoaceae, Cactaceae (about 400 species), Didiereaceae, and Euphorbiaceae. Of particular interest are the Gymnocalycium, Mammillaria, and Rhipsalis; Alluaudia, Aloe, and Kalanchoe from South Africa and Madagascar; and notable specimens of Welwitschia mirabilis from the South African desert.

It was established before the foundation of the State of Israel and was anchored in law in 1949. Today it is a one-week program of discipline and military training usually under commanders serving with the Nahal infantry brigade. Gadna hosts an estimated 19,000 Israeli youth annually, as well as numerous foreign youths. History David Ben-Gurion visiting a Gadna base in Be'er Ora (1957) Gadna, an abbreviation for Gdudei No'ar (; lit. youth battalions), was an organization for youth created before the Israeli Declaration of Independence. Alongside preliminary training for military service, Gadna clubs taught Zionist history, promoted love of the Land of Israel and encouraged members to engage in farming and volunteerism. Social activities included readings of ideological material from Labor Zionist newspapers and publications.Oz Almog, The Sabra: The Creation of the New Jew, English edition at University of California Press (2000), The program was established in the early 1940s by the Haganah, which became the core of the IDF. Thousands of Gadna members fought in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.Shelli Paz (13 April 2008), \\"Gadna pre-army program tries to restore IDF's appeal\\", The Jerusalem Post In June 1949, the Knesset passed a law requiring men and women who were physically and mentally fit to serve in the military from the age of 18. The law also provided for the establishment of the Gadna semi-military framework to prepare high school students for military service.Ahron Bregman, Israel's Wars: A History Since 1947, Routledge (2002) Insignia The commanders, the \\"Mefakdim\\" or \\"Mefakdot\\" ( or , masculine and feminine plurals), who are sergeants and officers, wear either the green beret of the Nahal infantry brigade, (though they do not have the infantry badge on their beret, or the Nahal shoulder tag) or the general IDF green beret, wearing the Education and Youth Corps badge and tag instead. The commanders wear a brown braid on their left shoulders. Trainees in Gadna are issued uniforms consisting of fatigue or B uniform (\\"Bet Uniforms\\", ) pants and a shirt, a military belt, a canteen, and a canteen holder. Trainees do not receive military shoes. Upon arrival, trainees are given hats which must be worn at all times. Trainees with long hair, both boys and girls, must always tie their hair. Living in army tents or barracks, the youth are organized into squads. The squad has two leaders chosen by the commander. The highest youth is taken under the base officer's wing and wears a braid on their left shoulder, or multi-colored (striped) epaulets. If they wear the braid they wear the same color epaulet as the rest of their unit. The second highest youth commander is the sergeant. They wear special epaulets, usually black, and they never wear a braid. Structure The Gadna program is subordinate to the Magen division of the Education and Youth Corps. =Bases= Numerous bases were related to the Gadna program over the years, although as of 2008, only 3 operational Gadna bases remain: *Sdeh Boker Gadna Base, in the Negev desert (the largest) *Tzalmon Gadna Base, in the Lower Galilee *Joara Gadna Base, on the Menashe Heights (the smallest) Plans exist to upgrade and renovate these bases. Controversies While the Gadna program has been criticized as \\"overly militaristic\\" by certain educators and professors in Israel, the Education and Youth Corps has prepared a program which would see more militaristic and combatant values inserted into the lessons conducted in the program, although less emphasis will be put on the physical aspect of the program.

It was a stop on the Underground Railroad, a network of people and places that facilitated the movements of escaped slaves. In addition, the building is believed to be the first grout building built in the United States. It is also known for its hexagonal shape. Description The Milton House is a grout building consisting of a three-story hexagonal section with a two-story hexagonal wing. The hotel's main rooms are located within the tower, which has a central spiral stairway with rooms on the sides; the common rooms are on the first floor, while the upper floors and the wing contain guest rooms. The house's grout construction inspired Orson Squire Fowler, an advocate of octagonal homes, to recommend the use of grout in such buildings. Behind the house is the Goodrich Cabin, which was built in 1837 and brought to the site in 1839; it was one of two cabins in which Goodrich lived when he first settled in Milton. History Milton House before roads were paved Joseph Goodrich, the founder of Milton, settled in Milton in 1839; he built a log cabin, since demolished, and brought the 1837 cabin to the site. Goodrich was a Seventh-Day Baptist from the Burned-over district of western New York, and like most people of his faith, he was known for his anti-slavery sentiments. Goodrich built the Milton House in 1845, which became a popular stop for travelers due to its location at the intersection of the military road between Chicago and Madison and the road from Janesville to Fort Atkinson. The house's proximity to these routes and the Rock River allowed it to function as a stop on the Underground Railroad; fugitive slaves in Wisconsin frequently followed the river to the area before taking the road to Racine, where a boat could take them to Canada. A tunnel connects the main building to a nearby cabin; while the circumstances in which the tunnel was constructed are unknown, Joseph's son Ezra claimed the tunnel was used to hide runaway slaves. Goodrich also hosted prominent abolitionist Sojourner Truth at the house when she visited Milton in the 1860s. In 1937 the house was in poor condition, uninhabited, and was threatened with being demolished. The Milton Historical Society acquired and restored the building. The house and cabin are open to the public via guided tours. Milton House was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1998. It is the most prominent abolitionist site still standing in Wisconsin. and See also *List of National Historic Landmarks in Wisconsin *National Register of Historic Places listings in Rock County, Wisconsin References External links National Park Service Network to Freedom *Wisconsin Historical Society *Milton House Museum Facebook Page Category:National Historic Landmarks in Wisconsin Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Wisconsin Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Wisconsin Category:Houses completed in 1838 Category:Houses on the Underground Railroad Category:Museums in Rock County, Wisconsin Category:Historic house museums in Wisconsin Category:Houses in Rock County, Wisconsin Category:Underground Railroad in Wisconsin Category:National Register of Historic Places in Rock County, Wisconsin ","title":"Milton House (Milton, Wisconsin)"},{"id":"14990254","text":"Hugh Enes Blackmore Hugh Enes Blackmore (1 October 1863 – 21 May 1945) was a British opera and concert singer and actor. Known as the \\"Iron-Throated Tenor\\", he is best remembered for his performances of tenor roles with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. His career with D'Oyly Carte spanned almost 30 years, ending with a season as the company's stage manager, and was later a teacher of operatic singing and acting. Early life and career Blackmore was born in Greenock in Scotland, the second of four children born to Elizabeth Mary née Collier (1834–1922) and Edward Blackmore (1824–1900), a marine engineer.Hugh E Blackmore in the 1871 Scotland Census, Ancestry.com, accessed 22 March 2015 (pay to view) He attended Fettes College in Edinburgh, where he sang tenor solos beginning at age 14. Encouraged by Alexander Potts, his headmaster, Blackmore took singing lessons and hoped to make a career in opera by training in Italy. Blackmore's father, however, wanted him to follow a more secure profession, so he trained as a solicitor in Cardiff.Hugh E Blackmore in the 1881 Wales Census, Ancestry.com, accessed 22 March 2015 (pay to view) Finding this career not to his liking, he gave up law and studied singing under Signor Caravoglia.The Gilbert and Sullivan Journal, Vol.1 No.12 (December 1927), p. 15 Blackmore as Sir Bailey Barre in Utopia, Limited, 1893 In the early 1890s, Blackmore sang in a variety of concerts with performers including Leonora Braham and W.

The concert, which included Schubert's incidental music from Rosamunde, receiving its \\"First performance in England in its original and complete form\\", was held under the patronage of the Master and fellows of Pembroke College, with a young Henry Wood conducting.\\"London Suburban Concerts (1893–98)\\". Concert Programmes, Arts and Humanities Research Council, accessed 21 June 2010 Blackmore's association with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company spanned almost 30 years.

He played Griffin David in several performances of A Welsh Sunset, which was a curtain-raiser for Pinafore that season. Later that year, Blackmore resumed touring with D'Oyly Carte, taking on the small roles of Leonard Meryll in The Yeomen of the Guard and Francesco in The Gondoliers, as well as singing in the chorus of the other shows on tour.Rollins and Witts, pp.125–40 In 1910, he gave up playing the character of Francesco but continued to play Leonard until July, after which date he played only chorus roles for the next two years. During D'Oyly Carte's 1912–13 season, he began to play the small role of First Yeoman in Yeomen. In July 1913 he added Annibale in The Gondoliers to his repertoire, stepping up to the more important role of Luiz for a short period in 1914. He also substituted at times in leading tenor roles, including Tolloller in Iolanthe (1914–15), Nanki-Poo in The Mikado (1917), Marco in The Gondoliers (1917), and Alexis in The Sorcerer (1918). He also played the role of Cyril in Princess Ida in 1918. Blackmore returned to the D'Oyly Carte chorus in 1918, also playing the roles of Leonard in Yeomen and Annibale in The Gondoliers from July 1919. From 1921, his only principal role was Annibale, but he occasionally filled in for Derek Oldham as Tolloller in Iolanthe, before retiring from the stage in April 1922. Blackmore was then employed by D'Oyly Carte to coach the Company's professional understudies in their roles. He was appointed as D'Oyly Carte's stage manager for the 1922–23 season, but, coming into \\"uncomfortable conflict with the artistic temperament\\", he was replaced the following season by Frederick Hobbs. After leaving the stage, Blackmore taught voice and coached actors in 'operatic stage craft' in the London-based 'G & S School of Opera', which he founded with his wife, describing himself in advertisements for the School as the 'principal tenor and SM' with D'Oyly Carte.The Gilbert and Sullivan Journal, Vol. 2, March 1928 – December 1930, p. 180 =Personal life= \\"Blackie\\", as he was known to friends and colleagues, married fellow D'Oyly Carter Theresa Mary Hewett \\"Tessa\\" Snelson (1870–1939) in 1902; they were introduced to each other on the stage of the Savoy Theatre by W.

(; fl. 1244-1262) was a Genoese troubadour of the mid-thirteenth century. He wrote two tensos which survive, one with Lanfranc Cigala and another (fragmentary) one with Simon Doria. There are several \\"Giacomo Grillos\\" mentioned in thirteenth-century documents from Genoa and it is difficult to definitively identify the troubadour with one. Chronologically, the Giacomo mentioned in an act of 15 August 1281 was probably not the troubadour. There were a Giacomo Grillo di Andrea and another di Alberto, but these are also unlikely candidates. The most likely is a judge who appeared in an act of 4 June 1257 concerning a division of property of the margraves of Ponzone. He was definitely a contemporary of Lanfranc. This is probably the same Giacomo as was responsible for providing lodging for Pope Innocent IV at Stella in 1244 and appears in an act of 7 March 1247 in the Liber Jurium Januae. He was also elected one of the fifteen reggitori della città (rectors of the city) in 1262 after the overthrow of Guglielmo Boccanegra. Luca Grimaldi, another troubadour, was one of the others. Though little is known of him and his surviving poetry is limited, Jacme was an esteemed poet to his contemporaries in Genoa. In a tenso with Simon Doria, Lanfranc alluded to Jacme's judicial profession: {  :A'n Iacme Gril, en cui es conoissenza, :Amics Symon, trametam la tenzon, :Q'en cobleian en don drecha sentenza.  :To Sir Jacme Grils, in whom is knowledge, :friend Simon, send this tenso, :so that he can impose a just sentence on the verses. } In a subsequent poem, Lanfranc connected Jacme with a Na Flors-de-lis (or Fiordiligi), a senhal (byname) for an unnamed Genoese woman, whom he submits to the Jacme's judgement. Segne'n Iacme Grils, e.us deman, Jacme's tenso with Simon Doria, is modeled on one between Sordello and Peire Guilhem de Tolosa and it is written in an effort to mock the former. Jacme's tenso with Lanfranc begins Per o car vos fegnetz de sotilment entendre. Notes Sources *Bertoni, Giulio. I Trovatori d'Italia: Biografie, testi, tradizioni, note.

The victim was Archibald Brown, aged 47. He and his wife Doris Lucy Brown lived in London Hill, Rayleigh, Essex and had two sons, Eric and Collin. Due to a motorcycle accident Archibald Brown lost the use of his legs at the age of 24 and thereafter required the use of a bath chair and was cared for by three nurses. Incident At 1:45 pm on Friday 23 July 1943 nurse Doris Irene Mitchell went to the air-raid shelter where Brown's bath chair was kept. She found that the door was locked from the inside and upon returning with Mrs Brown they met Eric Brown, then aged 19, coming out. Eric was irritated and evasive. Both women took the wheeled chair to the house and helped Archibald to get in. Brown was dressed in pyjamas and a dressing gown and was covered with a plaid travelling rug. Mitchell took Archibald Brown out of the house. After walking for about a mile, Brown had shifted his weight apparently while feeling for a cigarette in his pocket. Mitchell, having stopped to light the cigarette returned to the back of the chair and pushed it forward. Within half a dozen paces there was a violent explosion. Mitchell suffered leg injuries and as far as she could see Brown and his bath chair had completely disappeared. The police found portions of the body at the side of the road and in nearby trees and gardens. Investigation Enemy action was soon ruled out as the cause of the explosion. Experts found the cause to be a British Hawkins grenade - a type of anti-tank mine that is detonated when an acid-filled glass ampoule is broken. The device had been placed under the bath chair's cushion. A formal murder investigation was begun. Doris Brown was interviewed at length at Rayleigh police station. It emerged that although Archibald Brown had been crippled and unable to walk, his will power was undiminished: he harshly ruled his wife and elder son. His wife was not allowed to visit her mother in nearby Rochford and Archibald Brown would constantly ring a bell to get his wife's attention, even if he perceived that a single flower was out of place in a vase. Eric Brown was constantly beaten and humiliated. Doris Brown stated that her husband had increasingly appeared to take a dislike to her. Eric, too, had noticed the deterioration in Archibald's behaviour, but he had taken a liking to his new nurse and their walks together. Arrest and trial The blame fell on Eric Brown. He had previously attended lectures on the same mine used in the murder, and, having joined the British Army some years previously, had access to a weapons store in Spilsby. Eventually Eric Brown gave a confession in which he blamed his actions on Archibald Brown's abusive attitude to both him and his mother. On 21 September 1943 he was committed to trial at the Essex Assizes. The trial started on 4 November; Eric Brown was tried at the Shire Hall, Chelmsford and declared insane. He was released in 1975.

The property is located in Genesee Depot in the Town of Genesee, Waukesha County, Wisconsin, United States. Ten Chimneys was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2003, for the significance of its owners to the history of performing arts, and for its distinctive architecture and decoration.  History  Lynn Fontanne was born in 1887 in England. From childhood she wanted to be an actress, starting as a chorus girl in Cinderella in 1905. In 1916 she came to the U.S., and hit real success playing in Dulcy in 1921. With Alfred Lunt, Jr. was born in 1892 in Milwaukee, the son of a Wisconsin lumberman. He was interested in the theater from the age of three, and enjoyed summers working on his aunt's farm in Neenah. In 1906 Alfred's Swedish-born stepfather moved the family out to the village of Genesee Depot, where he practiced as a physician. But within a few years financial problems forced the family to move to Finland, then a Swedish colony, to live with the step- father's family. Alfred spent summers in Finland, learning a fondness for the culture. During the school year he attended Carroll College Academy back in Waukesha, then started at Carroll College, where he majored in oratory, appeared in college plays, and designed, built, and painted scenery. In 1912 he left Carroll and headed east to join a theater company in Boston, where he eventually became a successful stage actor, achieving acclaim in Booth Tarkington's play Clarence in 1919. Despite his successful, cosmopolitan career, Alfred remained fond of his childhood home in Wisconsin. In 1913 he bought three acres near Genesee Depot that would become Ten Chimneys. In 1915 he had the first section of the house built, described by a visitor as \\"one enormous room with staircases leading up to a gallery which had doors leading to bedrooms.\\" Alfred's mother Hattie and his half-siblings lived there year- round, and he joined them in the summers.Laabs, p. 42. The Cottage, expanded from a chicken coop. Lunt and Fontanne fell in love in 1919 when they met backstage at a rehearsal in New York, and they married in 1922. The couple's first summer at home with Alfred's mother was strained and in 1924 they set about expanding the chicken coop into a cottage for themselves to live in. The resulting cottage has many details drawn from traditional Swedish farmhouses: corner brick and stucco fireplaces with sloping chimney wings, folk paintings (some painted by Lunt himself), and inscriptions in Swedish throughout the cottage. The exception is Lynn Fontanne's room upstairs, which is white on white, with a carpet of stitched sheepskins. In 1923 Lunt and Fontanne appeared in their first play together, Sweet Nell of Old Drury. The following year they appeared together in the play The Guardsman, which was highly acclaimed and which they later made into a movie. Over the years they starred together in over 140 Broadway plays, and were considered the first family of American theater. In 1932 Lunt and Fontanne would swap houses with his mother and sister, with Lunt and Fontanne moving into the main house and his mother and sister moving to the Cottage. With that, Lunt renamed the Cottage the \\"hen house.\\" The greenhouse and new chicken coop. Over the years Lunt and Fontanne continued building and developing at Ten Chimneys. In 1936 they added the L-shaped swimming pool and the cabana. In 1938 they began remodeling and expanding the house, adding quarters for the cook and housekeeper and extra living space. The design was a collaboration between Lunt and architect Charles Dornbusch of Loebl, Schlossman and Demuth of Chicago, who helped with most of the structures on the estate, including the cottage fourteen years before. In 1939 they added the metal gate around the auto court. In 1947 they completed the new chicken coop (designed with advice from a specialist at the UW Ag Department) and greenhouse, and the gatehouse. Also in 1947 they reconstructed the Studio, a traditional hewn-log building that was taken apart in Sweden, shipped to America, and reassembled for use as a rehearsal space. Flagstone paths and retaining walls were added later to tie the estate together. The Studio In his NRHP nomination, Jim Draeger states \\"the crowning jewel of Ten Chimneys is the finely decorated and furnished interior of the main house.\\" The entry hall features marble tile, hand-painted murals on the walls, a porcelain Swedish stove, and a dramatic spiral staircase that leads to the second level. On that level are the kitchen and what the Lunts called the Flirtation Room, which leads to other parts of the house, including the Music Room, with a fireplace and hand-painted murals depicting Biblical scenes like baby Moses among the bullrushes. The murals were painted by artist Claggett Wilson starting in 1938, when the house was expanded. The library has a secret passage through a bookshelf. The upper level contains bedrooms, with murals showing peasants farming and wildlife. Lynn's bedroom is again colored light, with a Swedish fireplace. Alfred's bedroom is simpler, also with its own Swedish corner fireplace. The many fireplaces require the ten chimneys which give the estate its name. Ten Chimneys was also a farm, though that may seem hard to reconcile with a Flirtation Room. As a child Lunt enjoyed working in the fields and that continued as an adult. Once while visiting the Oliviers in England, he wrote home: \\"...I had a high old time as their garden was full of weeds & did I go to it...\\" From the initial three acres, the farm at Ten Chimneys grew to over 100. Lunt was absent much of the year, so in 1929 he hired Ben Perkins of Mukwonago as overseer. While Lunt was away, he and Perkins exchanged letters about matters like the used silo filler they bought for $65. (Lunt was cost-conscious.) They started a large vegetable garden in 1939 and an orchard later. In 1941, Alfred and Lynn bought each other cows as Christmas gifts - the first two cows on the farm. In 1942 the farm included four cows, some pigs and up to 200 chickens. To support the animals, they grew 6 acres of corn, 7 acres of oats, four of alfalfa, one of clover and 3/4 acres of wheat. The milk from the cows was made into butter, with some eaten on the farm and some sold locally. Some butter, meat and vegetables were shipped to the Lunts in New York and even in Europe during WWII, when rationing made them hard to obtain otherwise. Alfred would recall in 1956: > I'm just a country boy who happens to be an actor. But fashionable parties > and clever talk - all that sort of thing - well, y'know, it bores me stiff. > I'd rather listen to my chickens clucking any time. During their careers, Fontanne and Lunt retreated to Ten Chimneys every summer for personal and artistic rejuvenation. A host of stage and screen luminaries made pilgrimages to Genesee Depot as guests of the Lunts, including Noël Coward, Helen Hayes, Laurence Olivier, and Vivien Leigh. Carol Channing said, \\"If you get to go to Ten Chimneys, you must have done something right.\\" Upon retirement, the Lunts returned to Ten Chimneys and spent the rest of their lives at their beloved home in Genesee Depot, with Alfred dying in 1977 and Lynn in 1983. =Opening to the public= In 1996 arts advocate Joseph W. Garton, a restaurateur in Madison, Wisconsin, purchased Ten Chimneys, and Ten Chimneys Foundation was established to preserve and share the estate. The foundation then purchased the property from Garton in 1998. As a historic property, the estate was exceptionally well preserved, since the Lunts' original furniture, decorations, and personal items were barely disturbed between Lynn Fontanne's death in 1983 and the beginning of preservation efforts by Ten Chimneys Foundation in 1998. Ten Chimneys Foundation opened the estate to the public for the first time on May 26, 2003, which would have been the Lunts' 81st wedding anniversary. The estate remains open for public tours from May through November. Ten Chimneys Foundation also continues to fulfill the estate's original role as a home for the arts by providing programming and resources for theater professionals.

The flavor profile of golden monkey tea is characterized by light, honeyed peach notes, and its lack of astringency. The name \\"Golden Monkey\\" can be used for many black teas. For determining particular flavour components, it is suggested to observe the leaf and try a sample. This tea is highly prized, as evidenced by its second-place finish in the Signature Famous Teas – Hot Tea Class of the 2009 World Tea Championship. This tea is hand-processed each spring by carefully plucking its leaves and buds. It is considered one of the finest black teas available. The name of the tea comes from the leaves that resemble monkey claws. Golden Monkey leaves are grown at the altitudes of 1200 metres. This tea comes from the Yunnan province; a mountainous, cloudy and misty province. It has grown tea for 1700 years. During ancient times, Golden Monkey was consumed by local landlords and Taipans. Due to the rarity of the tea, the Taipans believed that it had special powers. The Taipans claimed that it provided them with agility and sexual powers. Despite the fact that it has been growing for 1700 years, Golden Monkey is a relatively new tea. It has only been developed for exporting for 13–18 years.

He was author of Suktas (hymns) 140 to 164 in the first Mandala (section) of the RgVeda.However there was another Dirghatamas named Dirghatama Mamteya. center In Bible, the descendants of this sage are mentioned as \\" Dirghasites\\". Background Dirghatamas was one of the Angirasa Rishis, the oldest of the Rishi families, and regarded as brother to the Rishi Bharadvaja, who is the seer of the sixth Mandala of the Rig Veda. Dirghatamas is also the chief predecessor of the Gotama family of Rishis that includes Kakshivan, Gautam Maharishi, Nodhas and Vamadeva(seer of the fourth Mandala of the Rig Veda), who along with Dirghatamas account for almost 150 of the 1000 hymns of the Rig Veda. Anga, Vanga, Kalinga, Pundra and Suhma, Ondra were also the sons of Dirghatamas through Raja Bali’s wife Sudhesana. His own verses occur frequently in many Vedic texts, a few even in the Upanishads. He was the reputed purohit or chief priest of King Bharata (Aitareya Brahmana VIII.23), one of the earliest kings of the land, after whom India was named as Bharata (the traditional name of the country). Birth Dīrghatama was son of Raṣṭra. Bhishma tells the narrative of the birth of Dirghatama Mamteya in the Mahabharata (book1, Adi Parva, CIV): \\"There was in olden days a wise Rishi of the name of Utathya. He had a wife of the name Mamata whom he dearly loved. One day Utathya's younger brother Brihaspati, the priest of the celestials, endued with great energy, approached Mamata. The latter, however, told her husband's younger brother—that foremost of eloquent men—that she had conceived from her connection with his elder brother and that, therefore, he should not then seek for the consummation of his wishes. She continued, 'O illustrious Brihaspati, the child that I have conceived has studied in his mother's womb the Vedas with the six Angas, Seed is not lost in vain. How can then this womb of mine afford room for two children at a time? Therefore, it behoveth thee not to seek for the consummation of thy desire at such a time. Thus addressed by her, Brihaspati, though possessed of great wisdom, could not suppress his desire. The child in the womb protested, 'There is no space here for two. O illustrious one, the room is small. I have occupied it first. It behoveth thee not to afflict me.' But Brihaspati without listening to what that child in the womb said, sought the embraces of Mamata possessing the most beautiful pair of eyes. And the illustrious Brihaspati, beholding this, became indignant, and reproached Utathya's child and cursed him, saying, 'Because thou hast spoken to me in the way thou hast at a time of pleasure that is sought after by all creatures, perpetual darkness shall overtake thee.' And from this curse of the illustrious Brihaspati, Utathya's child who was equal unto Brihaspati in energy, was born blind and came to be called Dirghatamas (enveloped in perpetual darkness). And the wise Dirghatamas, possessed of a knowledge of the Vedas, though born blind, succeeded yet by virtue of his learning, in obtaining for a wife a young and handsome Brahmana maiden of the name of Pradweshi. And having married her, the illustrious Dirghatamas, for the expansion of Utathya's race, begat upon her several children with Gautama Dirghatamas as their eldest. Asya Vamasya Hymn Dirghatamas is famous for his paradoxical apothegms.Gupta, Nolini Kanta. \\"Seer Poets\\", p.8 His mantras are enigmas: \\"He who knows the father below by what is above, and he who knows the father who is above by what is below is called the poet.\\" The Asya Vamasya (RgVeda 1.164) is one of the sage's most famous poems. Early scholars (such as Deussen in his Philosophy of the Upanisads) tried to say that the poems of Dirghatamas were of a later nature because of their content, but this has no linguistic support which has been argued by modern Sanskrit scholars (such as Dr. C. Kunhan Raja in his translation of the Asya Vamasya Hymn). The reason that earlier Western scholars believed them to be of a later origin is due to the monist views found there. They believed that early Vedic religion was pantheistic and a monist view of god evolved later in the Upanisads - but the poems of Dirghtamas (1.164.46) which say \\"there is One Being (Ekam Sat) which is called by many names\\" proves this idea incorrect. Earliest Mention of the Zodiac Some scholars have claimed that the Babylonians invented the zodiac of 360 degrees around 700 BCE, perhaps even earlier. Many claim that India received the knowledge of the zodiac from Babylonia or even later from Greece. However, as old as the Rig Veda, the oldest Vedic text, there are clear references to a chakra or wheel of 360 spokes placed in the sky. The number 360 and its related numbers like 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 108, 432 and 720 occur commonly in Vedic symbolism. It is in the hymns of the Rishi Dirghatamas (RV I.140 - 164) that we have the clearest such references. Famous Sayings A number of famous sayings originate from the verses of Dirghatamas. Another one bites the dust The first time the phrase \\"bites the dust\\" appears is in the Rgveda (1.158.4-5) where the poet Dirgatama has a prayer to the divine doctors and says ‘may the turning of the days not tire me, may the fires not burn me, may the wood-pyre not eat the earth, may the waters not swallow me’. There are disputes on what \\"bites the dirt\\" means in sayana’s commentary in the 14th century- which means the phrase had gone out of style in India at this time as most people began to be cremated instead of buried. But reading the padbandha, it's very clear that it refers to the wood-pyre eating earth, not the deceased human. > mā mām edho daśatayaś cito dhāk pra yad vām baddhas tmani khādati kśāṃ Note the use of 3rd person singular verb ending -ti for khād (to eat). Dirghatama is using it as a prayer from death - such as don’t let me die and be burned. If it were a prayer saying \\"let me not eat the earth\\", the 1st person singular, -mi or -āni would have been used. Here, eating of earth effect is produced by charring of earth by burnt wood-pyre.  References  * Gupta, Nolini Kanta. \\"Seer Poets\\". Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Pondicherry, 1970. * Johnson, Williard.

In a career which lasted from 1985 until 1988, he ran ten times and won seven races. He showed some promise as three-year-old in 1986, but emerged as a top- class horse in 1987 when he defeated The Derby winner Reference Point in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown. In 1988, he was the dominant middle-distance horse in Britain, winning a second Eclipse Stakes and taking the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. Background Bred by John L. Moore, Mtoto was a bay horse with a white blaze. He was sired by the 1967 British Horse of the Year Busted out of the French mare Amazer. Racing career He recovered so well from the foot problems which dogged his early career that when he went to stud, he did so as the winner of the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, and double winner of both the Eclipse Stakes and Prince of Wales's Stakes. He very nearly added the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe to this list too. Mtoto got off to a slow start on the track. By the end of his three-year-old campaign, he had won only once, and that was a small maiden race at Haydock Park. His first important success came as a four-year-old in the Brigadier Gerard Stakes at Sandown Park. In his final year, 1988, he ended a previously unbeaten season with an unlucky, fast closing neck second to Tony Bin in the Arc. Jockey Michael Roberts was blamed by many for poor positioning in this final race, Mtoto rounding the home turn into a short straight behind a wall of horses, in one of the largest Arc fields ever assembled. Stud career Mtoto stood at Aston Upthorpe Stud at a fee of £18,000, where he sired Shaamit, Celeric, Serious Attitude and many other horses including Presenting, Arbatax and Maylane. He was retired from stud duties in 2006 and spent his retirement at Aston Upthorpe alongside Zilzal. Mtoto is grandsire to the 2008 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Denman and 2011 Grand National winner Ballabriggs. On 24 May 2011 it was announced that Mtoto had died aged 28. Later taken as the name of a restored steam tractor (i.e. traction engine) built by John Fowler (Leeds).

Biography Barsalou had an early beginning in business with an apprenticeship in auctioneering at the age of 15. He quickly advanced in business and by 1853 was a partner in Benning and Barsalou, an enterprise mainly in auctioneering with some activity in real estate. He went on to other business ventures and bought a company with two partners which became the Canadian Rubber Company (now Uniroyal), and was its first president. The core of his business activities was the soap factory he founded with his sons in 1875 at the corner of rue Durham (now rue Plessis) and Ste-Catherines, which licensed soap recipes and brand names from a number of firms over the years, including the Tête de Cheval brand and Savon Barsalou. He was also involved in a number of other business ventures and owned, through his firm, at one time or another, many key properties in Montreal. He was a major figure in the Montreal business community in the late 19th century, and he financed or played a role in much of the industrial development of the city at that time. He participated in municipal politics in Montreal as well, running unsuccessfully for alderman in 1873 against Ferdinand David, and later playing a key role in the establishment of the city of Maisonneuve (now part of Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve), for which he was mayor from 1884 to 1889 and from 1890 to 1892. Barsalou's daughter Hortense was married to Montreal mayor, Senator, and Conservative Party cabinet minister Alphonse Desjardins.

He scored his first goal in his next appearance against Walsall in November 1987 and ended the season with 17 first team appearances to his name. Lightfoot joined fellow youngsters such as Brian Croft, Robbie Painter and Colin Woodthorpe in emerging from the Chester youth set-up to become first-team regulars during this period. In future seasons Lightfoot was a regular in the Chester side, making more than 30 league appearances in each season until 1993–94. By this point Lightfoot had been converted by Graham Barrow from a central defender to an attacking midfielder, reflected in his 14 goals as Chester won promotion from Division Three. In the summer of 1995 Lightfoot followed Barrow to Wigan Athletic for a tribunal fee of £87,500. However, by March 1996 he was on the move again when he joined Crewe Alexandra. In May 1997 Lightfoot appeared as a substitute as Crewe beat Brentford in the Division Two play-off final at Wembley Stadium, giving Lightfoot his first chance to play in the second tier in English football. Lightfoot's final taste of league football came during a loan spell with Oldham Athletic in the early weeks of the 2000–01 season.

Kool is generally regarded as being instrumental in the development of the jungle music scene.  History  Kool first broadcast on 28 November 1991 on the frequency of 94.5FM, from Hackney, East London. Kool has stated that it was \\"the very first pirate station ever to play hardcore jungle\\". Simon Reynolds would call it \\"London's ruling pirate station\\" in an account of the beginnings of jungle in his book Energy Flash,Simon Reynolds: Energy Flash. Picador 1998, , p.245. whilst in State of Bass, Martin James would consider it \\"The single most important pirate station in jungle\\".Martin James: State of Bass. Boxtree 1997, , p.50. By late 1992, Kool started to promote its own events, leading to the founding of the Jungle Fever night in August 1993. In July 1993, its then-neighbouring station also broadcasting from the Nightingale Estate, Rush FM, was subject to a high profile raid by the authorities leading to media accusations of drug dealing at raves promoted by the two stations. In April 1996, Kool was featured in a BBC First Sight documentary about pirate radio in London, in which its Kool Skool club night also appeared. In the same year, it branched out by launching a sister station, Kool FM Midlands based in Birmingham, which continued until 2002. In May 2007, Kool FM featured in a BBC London News report about pirate radio station interference to the emergency services and their use of the airwaves.  Internet Radio  In August 2010, Kool relaunched as Kool London and now operates as an internet radio station, providing a live audio stream on its website as well as archived shows.  Later years  Kool was involved in two live broadcasts with the artist Eddie Peake.

The division was formed twice, and was given the title 'Lithuanian' during its second formation. It was originally established at Tambov in May 1918. It was wiped out at Mga in July 1941. Reformed and given the title 'Lithuanian', the division participated in several battles against Nazi Germany, including Kursk, Belarus, and the Baltic. The division became a brigade postwar but became a division again in 1950. It was disbanded in 1956. History =First formation= The division was originally formed in 1918. At the beginning of Operation Barbarossa the 16th Rifle Division (I Formation) was part of North-Western Front's 27th Army, reporting directly to Army headquarters along with the 67th Rifle Division and 3rd Rifle Brigade.Orbat.com/Niehorster, 27th Army Order of Battle, 22 June 1941 It was destroyed at Mga amid the first German drive on Leningrad. =Second formation= When the 16th Division was reformed after its destruction, it was given the name 'Lithuanian' largely for political purposes. After Lithuania, along with Estonia and Latvia, was occupied by the Soviet Union in June 1940, the Lithuanian Army was reorganized into the 29th Rifle Corps of Red Army. However, at the start of Operation Barbarossa in June 1941, Lithuanians massively deserted, joined anti-Soviet June Uprising, or surrendered to the Germans. The corps was officially disbanded in August 1941. Despite this failure, Lithuanian communists, including Antanas Sniečkus and Mečislovas Gedvilas, sought to establish a new Lithuanian unit. Similar national military units were created by Estonians (8th Estonian Rifle Corps) and Latvians (130th Latvian Rifle Corps). The decision to re-form the division was made by the State Defense Committee on 18 December 1941. It was decided that it would be formed in the Moscow Military District, in the city of Balakhna, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast.Арон Шнеер. Плен. Глава 7. 16-я Литовская дивизия The division was officially labelled \\"Lithuanian\\" to encourage enlistment of the Lithuanians. Personnel were assembled from: * staff and remnants of the 184th Rifle Division (former 29th Rifle Corps), * Lithuanians that were living in Russia for a long time, * and any Lithuanian-speaking refugees that had fled Lithuania after the German invasion. However, out of 23,000 refugees from Lithuania, 15,000 of them were Jewish. The officers of the division were mostly graduates from the Vilnius infantry academy, who had been evacuated after the invasion to Novokuznetsk, Kemerovo Oblast.  1943  Formation and training of the division came to an end by February 1943 and the division entered the war on 21 February 1943 at Alekseyevka, 50 km southeast of Oryol. This brought the division into the path of the Wehrmacht's Operation Citadel or Battle of Kursk, where it served with the 42nd Rifle Corps of the 48th Army, Soviet Central Front. In the first days of the battle, the 16th Rifle Division withstood the attack of the German and 18th Panzer Divisions, that were accompanied by 120 planes.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army , 1 July 1943 lists the 16th as part of 42nd Rifle Corps along with 202nd and 399th Rifle Divisions After suffering serious losses, the Soviet armies eventually emerged victorious. Between February 20 and March 24, 1943, the division lost 1,169 dead and 3,275 injured men.Raudonosios armijos 16-oji lietuviškoji šaulių divizija: kelias nuo suformavimo iki katastrofos prie Aleksejevkos (1941-1943 m. vasaris-kovas), page 337 During this battle a private named Viktoras Jacenevičius, was wounded, taken prisoner and then tortured to death by the Germans. He was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. Following the victory at Kursk, the division was assigned to the 1st Baltic Front.  1944  On 1 June 1944, the division was directly subordinate to the Front, along with 47th Rifle Division.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army , 1 June 1944 Along with the 3rd Belarussian Front, they invaded Belarus and much of Lithuania. On 2 August 1944, division had arrived at the suburbs of Šiauliai, which was home to their commander, Vladas Karvelis. The division was stationed there for one month, to receive reinforcements from Lithuanian forced-volunteers. In mid-August the city of Šiauliai was hit by the German Šiauliai Offensive. The Wehrmacht divisions were armed with 900 armoured vehicles and artillery pieces. For three days the 16th Division stood its ground, and in the end as the German attack ran out of steam the Division emerged victorious. On 31 October the division was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for \\"courage and valor\\" in breaking through German defenses west of Šiauliai.  1945  On 31 January 1945, the Lithuanian division received orders to join the fight against the Germans in the Courland Pocket. The German resistance was strong and elements of Army Group Courland did not surrender to the Soviets until 8–9 May at the end of World War II in Europe.

The total ethnic make-up of the division was: * 3720 Lithuanians (36.3%), * 3064 Russians (29%), * 2973 Jews (29%), * 492 of other nationalities (4.8%). Although other sources cite figures of 2378 Jews (23.2%) in the division, it is still the highest number of ethnic Jews amongst all divisions of the Red Army. Jews made 13% (136 persons) of all officers in the division and 34.2% of all soldiers in the infantry regiments. 12 soldiers of a division have been awarded the title, Hero of Soviet Union, of them, four were Jews: * major Volf Vilensky, * sergeant Kalman Shur, * corporal Grigorijus Ušpolis * and private Borisas Cindelis (posthumously). Originally, commands and orders were given in the Lithuanian language. However over a third of all soldiers in the division did not speak Lithuanian. More problems arose when officers from other divisions were sent to train and transfer their fighting experience to the soldiers of the 16th. Most of them had never heard a word of Lithuanian in their lives, and were mainly Russophone. For these reasons, the language of commands, orders and even conversation, became Russian and also Yiddish.

The Black Pine Animal Sanctuary (formerly Black Pine Animal Park) is an exotic animal sanctuary located in Albion, Indiana, United States. The sanctuary provides permanent refuge for displaced, captive-raised exotic animals kept as \\"pets\\" or retired from performance. The population typically ranges from 75 to 100 animals representing between 50 and 60 species, some of which are endangered. Various educational visitor and outreach programs are offered, including guided sanctuary tours, school field trips, and special events. Animals are housed in natural habitats scattered throughout a partially wooded site, and in buildings. Visitors view them from behind protective barriers much like they would in a traditional U.S. zoo. The sanctuary was originally founded as a privately owned zoo, but relocated to this location in 2006 after transitioning to a non-profit, charitable sanctuary. The sanctuary does not buy, sell, breed, trade, or seek out animals, or use animals for entertainment. Displaced, captive-raised exotic animals are provided refuge for the rest of their lives. The sanctuary is licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as a Class \\"C\\" exhibitor, is incorporated (as of 2000) as Professional Animal Retirement Center (PARC), Inc. and is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization.  History  Black Pine Animal Sanctuary began operating in 1994 as a privately owned for- profit corporation. It was originally known as Black Pine Exotics and, later, Black Pine Animal Park. The earliest educational programming offered was to local pre-schools and primary schools who took field trips to see the animals and learn about them. In the mid-1990s the sanctuary added a gift shop and established a regular tour schedule during the summer season for the general public. In 1998, following the launch of the sanctuary's first web site, visitor attendance began to steadily increase. In 2004, over 17,000 visitors from all over the U.S. and several other countries visited. In 2003, the sanctuary reorganized and began operating under Professional Animal Retirement Center (PARC), Inc., a 501c3 tax exempt non-profit corporation. In December 2006, the sanctuary completed a relocation to its current site. The sanctuary is managed by a volunteer board of directors, a paid staff that includes a full-time executive director, facilities manager, four lead animal keepers, and an office/gift shop coordinator. Additional support is provided by interns and volunteers. In April 2010, the sanctuary's Board of Directors officially change the organization's \\"doing business as\\" name from Black Pine Animal Park to Black Pine Animal Sanctuary to more accurately reflect the non-profit mission and its policy of no buying, selling, breeding, trading, or commercial use of animals.  Exhibits  A walking tour of the sanctuary explores eight areas: grazing animals, primate house, north tiger house, west end (including Dr. Sam's Clinic and quarantine, Betsy's (bear) house, the woods, reptile house, and aviary.

After winning only once from his first nine races, he demonstrated much improved form in the summer of 1954 to win The Derby, becoming the first American colt to win the race in seventy-three years. Later that year he added a second British Classic when winning the St. Leger Stakes by a record margin of twelve lengths. He was later retired to a successful stud career. Background Never Say Die was a chestnut colt with a white blaze and three white feet, bred and raced by the American philanthropist and art collector Robert Sterling Clark. At the time of his Derby win, the horse stood 15.3 ½ hands high. He was conceived in Ireland but foaled at Jonabell Farm in Kentucky. His sire, Nasrullah had been a talented but temperamental racehorse who was beginning to have an impact as a stallion. Never Say Die's dam, Singing Grass won seven unimportant races in England. Clark sent the colt to England as a yearling to be trained by Joseph Lawson, who had already won nine Classics Clark's other British trainer, Harry Peacock had been given first choice of the owner's yearlings but had rejected Never Say Die because of his low opinion of Nasrullah's stock. Racing career =1953:two-year-old season= In six races as a two-year-old, Never Say Die showed some good form but appeared to be somewhat below the best of his generation. He won the six furlong Rosslyn Stakes at Ascot Racecourse in July and finished third in both the Richmond Stakes and Dewhurst Stakes. In the Free Handicap, a rating of the year's best British juveniles, Never Say Die was allotted a weight of 115 pounds, eighteen pounds below the top-rated The Pie King. =1954:three-year- old season= Never Say Die made good physical progress over the winter, but showed little improvement in his first two starts. He finished second in the Union Jack Stakes at Aintree Racecourse and then finished unplaced in the Free Handicap at Newmarket in April. On his final trial race for The Derby, Never Say Die returned to Newmarket and was moved up in distance for the Newmarket Stakes over ten furlongs. Ridden by Manny Mercer, he took the lead a furlong out but was overtaken in the closing stages and finished third to Elopement and Golden God. On a dull, chilly day at Epsom, Never Say Die started a 33/1 outsider in a field of twenty-two runners for the Derby. According to some accounts, he would have started at even longer odds if his memorable name and the publicity attracted by his eighteen-year-old jockey Lester Piggott had not made him a popular choice with many members of the public. The colt was always well-placed and was sent into the lead early in the straight by Piggott. He won comfortably by two lengths from Arabian Night and Darius. Clark was ill in New York hospital and unable to attend the race, which saw Never Say Die becoming the first American-bred Derby winner since Iroquois in 1881. Never Say Die next contested the King Edward VII Stakes at Ascot Racecourse. In an extremely rough and unsatisfactory race he finished fourth behind Rashleigh. Piggott was immediately suspended by the racecourse stewards for his riding of Never Say Die and was reported to the Jockey Club who extended the riding ban to six months. The suspended Piggott was replaced by Charlie Smirke for Never Say Die's run in the St Leger at Doncaster in September. The colt started 100/30 favourite in a field of sixteen. He won very easily by twelve lengths, the biggest winning margin officially recorded in the race's history. He was retired to stud shortly after his win at Doncaster. Assessment Timeform awarded Never Say Die a rating of 137, the highest for any horse in 1954. A rating of 130 is considered the mark of an above average European Group One winner. In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Never Say Die a “superior” Derby winner and the fifty-third best British racehorse of the 20th Century .

Only 24 production examples of the type were built before the contract was cancelled. Design and development With the outbreak of the Second World War, the United States Army Air Corps (later U.S. Army Air Forces) was ill-prepared for a major war. In an effort to obtain as many aircraft as possible the USAAF contracted Fleetwings, a specialist fabricator of sheet stainless steel, to produce a basic training monoplane. A prototype Model 23 was ordered as the XBT-12 during 1939. The XBT-12 was an all-metal low-wing cantilever monoplane with a fixed tailwheel landing gear and powered by a Pratt & Whitney R-985 engine. The aircraft had two identical tandem cockpits for instructor and pupil covered by a continuous canopy. It was the first military aircraft to be constructed primarily from welded stainless steel. Operational history After evaluation of the XBT-12 starting in late 1939, an order for 176 production aircraft, designated BT-12, was placed. Only 24 aircraft were delivered, one in 1942 and 23 in 1943, before the contract was cancelled, the Vultee BT-13 being preferred.

Description  On December 20, 1940, the Czechoslovak government in exile in London ordered the creation of a second version of the Czechoslovak War Cross. It was created and issued not as a general service medal, but as a meritorious decoration for those had provided great service to the Czechoslovak state during the years of World War II. The award was mainly intended for persons who had helped liberate Czechoslovakia from the rule of Nazi Germany. Several American officers received the award, such as Dwight D. Eisenhower or George S. Patton, and the decoration was also bestowed to national heroes, such as the men who had assassinated Reinhard Heydrich in operation Anthropoid. The second Czechoslovak War Cross was known as the Czechoslovak War Cross 1939–1945 and a common phrase for the decoration was also the Czechoslovak Croix de Guerre. In cases where an individual had received both the World War I and World War II versions, both medals could be worn simultaneously. The validity of the War Cross was confirmed after the end of World War II, in January 1946. There were no further versions of the Czechoslovak War Cross after 1945 and the medal became obsolete with the division of the Czechoslovak state in 1992.  Design  The medal was dye- struck and high in detail, with a bronze finish. On the obverse of the cross there was the small state symbol of Czechoslovakia, on the reverse – symbols of the lands in circles: symbol of Bohemia in the middle, Slovakia above, Moravia on the left, Silesia on the right, and Carpatho-Ukraine below. In the spaces around the middle circle, the year 1939 is spread. The medal was suspended from a white ribbon with red and blue stripes.

The signatories also signed a treaty on transportation and communication cooperation the same day. The non-aggression pact largely held together until Angola, along with most of Southern Africa, invaded the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1996 in the First Congo War. The treaty came in direct response to Cuba's invasions of Zaire from Angola in 1977 and 1978. Mobutu and Kaunda's support for National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) and National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) rebels in the Angolan Civil War and dos Santos' support for the Front for the National Liberation of the Congo in Zaire led to repeated clashes in the 1970s.

The park dates to 1867 to 1868, founded as Fytche Square in honour of the then Chief Commissioner of British Burma, Albert Fytche. The site was previously a vacant, swampy site originally known as Tank Square, which was cleared and laid out as a public recreation ground. A white marble statue of Queen Victoria was placed in the center of the park in 1896, gifted by a wealthy Armenian firm in Rangoon. After 1935, the park was renamed Bandula Square, reflecting rising nationalist sentiment.

It is owned by iHeartMedia and it broadcasts a country format branded as 106.7 The Bull. Its studios are located in the Denver Tech Center, while its transmitter is located on Lookout Mountain west of Golden. History 106.7 FM signed the air on June 19, 1962 as KLZ-FM. Initially airing a simulcast of their then-AM sister station, it flipped to a rock format in the early 1970s. In 1977, KLZ-FM changed their call letters to KAZY (now at 93.7 FM in Cheyenne, Wyoming) and continued with a rock format until April 20, 1994, when KBPI took over the 106.7 frequency, moving from 105.9 (now KALC).http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1994/RR-1994-04-01.pdf In December 2017, iHeartMedia re-aligned multiple stations in the Denver, Colorado Springs, Fort Collins, and Cheyenne markets in order to form a trimulcast (which was later split up on January 28, 2019) of KBPI on the 107.9 frequency. To facilitate the move for the main signal, on the 1st, KYWY (an adult contemporary station in Cheyenne, Wyoming, which was acquired by iHeart in 2016) moved its existing format to an HD Radio subchannel of KOLT-FM and its analog translator on 97.1, allowing KPAW to move its classic rock format and call letters to the 92.9 signal four days later. On the 11th, KBPI then moved its format and call letters to KPAW and translator K300CP, while also adding a simulcast on KDZA-FM. The KYWY calls were warehoused on the former 106.7 signal; iHeart stated that the station would temporarily simulcast KBPI through the end of the year, and be re- launched with a new format after the end of the simulcast period. On December 18, 2017, at 5 p.m., KYWY dropped out of the simulcast and flipped to country music as 106.7 The Bull, launching with a 10,000 song commercial-free marathon. The flip gave long-time country stalwart KYGO its first full-market competition since that station flipped to the format in 1979, while also competing with KWOF, which rimshots the market from the north (KWOF later flipped to sports talk in 2018 after its sale to Kroenke Sports & Entertainment).

She served in the Pacific Ocean and provided troop transport service. She returned home at war’s end with five battle stars to her credit. The steel-hulled, single-screw cargo vessel was laid down as SS Excelsior under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 589) on 23 July 1942 at Sparrow's Point, Maryland, by the Bethlehem Sparrow's Point Shipyard; renamed Windsor and classified a transport, AP-100, on 5 October 1942; launched on 28 December 1942; sponsored by Miss Patricia Moreell, the daughter of Rear Admiral Ben Moreell, Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks; reclassified an attack transport, APA-55, on 16 June 1943; and commissioned at the Norfolk Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia, on 17 June 1943, Commander D. C. Woodward in command. World War II Pacific Theatre operations =Shakedown cruise= Windsor began her shakedown on 20 June and conducted eight training cruises in Chesapeake Bay. After post-shakedown availability, the ship departed the east coast of the United States on 9 December, bound for the Pacific. Upon reaching Pearl Harbor, Windsor became a unit of Transport Division (TransDiv) 4, 5th Fleet Amphibious Force. =Kwajalein= Windsor embarked the men and equipment of the 3d Battalion, 17th Regimental Combat Team, 7th Army Division, and departed the Hawaiian Islands on 22 January 1944, bound for the Marshall Islands as part of Task Force (TF) 52. Windsor participated in the assault landing at Kwajalein and, after the island had been secured early in February, sailed for the Ellice Islands. =Diversion to Humboldt Bay= Reaching Funafuti soon thereafter, Windsor there joined the 3rd Fleet and was subsequently ordered to Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, for amphibious training and maneuvers. After shifting to Torokina, Bougainville, on 28 March and to Milne Bay, New Guinea, on 1 April, the attack transport was assigned to the 7th Fleet Amphibious Forces late in April. Meanwhile, on 22 April, the 7th \\"Amphibs\\" had put ashore Army troops at Hollandia and took the Japanese completely by surprise. However, the following evening, a Japanese air raid blew up a captured ammunition dump and ensuing fires destroyed nearly 60 percent of the supplies landed. As a result, Windsor--initially ordered to Tanahmerah Bay--was diverted to Humboldt Bay, Hollandia, as part of the effort to replenish the lost supplies. Upon arriving there on 24 April, she landed troops of the 2d Battalion of the American Army's 34th Infantry Division. Simultaneous with the landings at Tanahmerah and Humboldt Bays, the 7th Amphibious Force also put troops ashore to secure Aitape and its vital airstrip. Windsor participated in the Aitape landing, putting ashore various units of the 32nd Division on 3 May. Windsor left New Guinea's waters on 7 May and headed for the Solomons, arriving at Guadalcanal three days later. At the end of May and the beginning of June, the attack transport embarked units of the 3rd Marine Division, left the Solomons on 4 June, and headed for the Central Pacific Area. She anchored first at Eniwetok and later at Kwajalein to prepare for and to await orders to begin her next operation, the occupation of Guam, in the Marianas. =Saipan= However, the amphibious forces first headed for Saipan -— regarded by some as the key to Japan's inner defenses. The assault on that island on 15 June resulted in the Japanese Fleet's challenging the Americans for the first time since the Battle of Midway, two years before. In the ensuing Battle of the Philippine Sea, on 19 and 20 June 1944, the enemy suffered heavily, losing three carriers. In the two-day battle, the Japanese Navy lost nearly 92 percent of its carrier-based aircraft (395 planes) as opposed to 130 planes lost by TF 58, the fast carrier task force under Vice Admiral Marc A. Mitscher. =Guam= Meanwhile, the unexpectedly stiff resistance on Saipan and the sortie of the Japanese Fleet had necessitated a delay in the landings on Guam. Finally, as part of Task Group (TG) 53.3, Windsor took part in the assault landings on Guam, landing troops of the 2d Battalion, 3d Marine Regiment, 3d Marine Division, on D-Day, 21 July, following close on the heels of intensive naval gunfire and carrier- based aircraft attacks. The attack transport put ashore her battle-garbed marines on the Asan beaches on the northern shores of Guam. =Peleliu= After the capture of the Marianas, the Navy turned its attention to the Western Caroline Islands. Fast carrier task forces ranged a wide area prior to the landings at Peleliu, Palau Islands, and Morotai, in the Netherlands East Indies, diverting or destroying Japanese forces that might have attempted to interfere with the invasion. Their planes struck Chichi Jima, Iwo Jima, Yap, Palau, and Mindanao, in the Philippines. Three days before the assault troops were slated to go ashore, ships and planes hurled an intensive air and surface bombardment against the Japanese defenses, while minesweepers cleared the waters off Peleliu and Angaur Islands, and underwater demolition teams destroyed beach obstructions. On 15 September, Windsor participated in the assault landings at Peleliu, putting ashore various elements of the 1st Marine Division, as part of TF 32. =Leyte= Following the successful landings on Peleliu, Windsor retired to Humboldt Bay and there was assigned to TF 78. A month later, the attack transport sortied as part of TF 78, bound for the Philippine Islands. While the ships proceeded north, the initial assault on Leyte began on 20 October when elements of the Army 10th and 24 Corps went ashore after heavy bombardment had softened up defenses ashore. Two days after D-Day, 22 October, Windsor arrived at Leyte; completed her unloading in record time; and stood out to sea later that day, bound once more for Humboldt Bay. =Under attack= There, Windsor embarked another group of reinforcements and headed back toward Leyte on 9 November, as part of TF 79. One day out of San Pedro Bay, their destination, the task force came under an attack by Japanese planes that lasted for three hours. Windsor emerged unscathed and put into San Pedro Bay on the morning of 14 November, commencing her unloading at 0804 and completing it at 1315, having disembarked the troops and equipment of the 32d Division. During that time, Japanese planes attacked the ships at 0900; but antiaircraft fire from the vital auxiliaries and their escorts, coupled with Army fighter planes, drove off the enemy. At the completion of that particular reinforcement operation, Windsor's historian recorded: \\"The unloading time of five hours and nineteen minutes, averaging 95.9 tons per hour, was a new record for this ship and equalled by very few of the other transports in the Task Force.\\" =General repairs= Proceeding from San Pedro Bay later on the 14th, Windsor steamed to Manus, in the Admiralty Islands, and moved thence to Tulagi, Florida Island, Guadalcanal. Departing Tulagi on 27 November, Windsor headed for San Francisco, California. The attack transport subsequently underwent general repairs at Moore's Shipyard, Oakland, California, from 13 December 1944 to 16 February 1945. =More troop transportation= She sailed for Hawaiian waters on 22 February. Routed onward to the western Pacific, Windsor departed Pearl Harbor on 20 March, with a contingent of construction battalion (\\"Seabees\\") troops embarked, and made calls at Eniwetok, Guam, and Samar, in the Philippines, discharging passengers and cargo in Guiuan roadstead, Samar, on 9 April. The attack transport lay off Samar for nearly two weeks before she received onward routing to return to San Francisco and, on her ensuing voyage, touched at Peleliu, Guam, Saipan, Tinian, and Pearl Harbor to pick up passengers. From San Francisco, Windsor headed up the west coast to Seattle, Washington, where she loaded general cargo and troops. She then returned to Pearl Harbor, reaching that port on 11 June and debarking the troops and discharging the cargo. Shifting to Honolulu, Windsor there picked up troops slated for transportation to Okinawa and, as part of Task Unit (TU) 96.6.15, proceeded to Hagushi Beach, where she remained from 25 July to 5 August. During that time, the attack transport, together with other warships in the vicinity, came under almost nightly attacks from Japanese planes but emerged unscathed. Windsor then sailed for Ulithi in Convoy OKU-17, reaching her destination on 10 August. =End-of-war activity= While Windsor lay at anchor at Ulithi lagoon, Japan accepted the unconditional surrender terms of the Potsdam Declaration; and hostilities ceased on 14 August. On 19 August, Windsor, as part of TU 94.18.12, proceeded to the Philippines, reaching Leyte on the 23rd. From there, she proceeded to the island of Cebu, in the southern Philippines, where she was assigned to Trans Div 53, TF 33. After embarking troops of the American Division and supplies on 31 August, Windsor sailed for Japan as part of the Tokyo occupation force. As the initial increments went ashore between 8 September and 10, within a week of the formal Japanese surrender on 2 September, Windsor landed her troops. The attack transport returned to Cebu, loaded equipment, and embarked the troops of the Army's 77th Division, and landed that unit at Hakodate, Hokkaidō, in early October. After the occupation of Japan, Windsor served under the aegis of Commander, Service Force, Pacific, reporting for duty with Operation Magic Carpet on 19 November. She remained in that duty for the remainder of 1945, participating in the massive sealift of returning sailors, soldiers, and marines to the United States. Post-War decommissioning After reporting to Commander, Western Sea Frontier, for disposition on 8 January 1946, Windsor received onward routing and transited the Panama Canal late in January, bound for the 8th Naval District. Decommissioned on 4 March 1946, Windsor was struck from the Navy list on 12 April 1946 and delivered to the War Shipping Administration, at Mobile, Alabama, on 1 August 1946, for disposition. Awards Windsor earned five battle stars for her World War II service.

Large numbers were built from 1917 to 1919, with the type being used to carry out anti-submarine patrols from bases in France from June 1918. It remained in use with the US Navy until 1928, and was also widely used as a civil passenger and utility aircraft. Development and design In late 1916, the Curtiss Aeroplane Company produced a new twin- engined flying boat, which was smaller than both the current Curtiss H-12 being built for Britain's Royal Naval Air Service and the earlier Curtiss H-4, with the new design given the factory designation Model H-14, although its design was unrelated to earlier Model H variants. The H-14 was a conventional unequal-span, unstaggered biplane, powered by two 100 hp (75 kW) pusher Curtiss OXX engines mounted between the wings. An order for 16 was placed by the United States Army before the prototype flew, but the prototype was disappointing and the US Army cancelled its order for H-14s.Bowers 1979, pp. 93–94. HS-1 production at Curtiss, in 1917-1918. The prototype was converted to a single-engined aircraft powered by a 200 hp (149 kW) Curtiss V-X-X engine, also in a pusher configuration, during 1917, being redesignated as the Curtiss HS-1 (for H model with single engine). The prototype was re-engined for use as a testbed for the new Liberty 12 engine, becoming the HS-1L, flying in this form on 21 October 1917.Swanborough and Bowers 1976, p.109. While Curtiss's V-X-X engine proved to be inadequate, as it did in its larger Model H cousins, the Liberty proved more suitable, and large orders were placed by the US Navy for the HS-1L. The HS-1 was armed with two 180 lb (80 kg) depth bombs, but it was found that these bombs were too small. In order to carry more powerful 230 lb (100 kg) bombs, Curtiss produced an increased-span version, the HS-2 with span increased by 12 ft (3.66 m) and an additional set of interplane struts, giving four-bay wings rather than the three-bay wings of the HS-1L.Bowers 1979, pp. 102–103. Again, Curtiss specified one of their own engines, and again, the Navy substituted this with the Liberty engine in the definitive HS-2L. The HS-3 was a further improved version with a new, wider hull flat-sided hull, that eliminated the typical Curtiss sponsons. The end of the war brought an end to plans to mass-produce this version, only six being built. The HS-1L and -2L were built in vast quantities: 675 by Curtiss themselves, and nearly as many again by various contractors that included L-W-F (250), Standard (80), Gallaudet Aircraft Company (60), Boeing (25) and Loughead (2). A further 25 were assembled by the US Navy from spare parts postwar.Bowers 1979, p.103. Operational history The HS-1L began to enter service early in 1918, flying anti-submarine patrols from a number of Naval Air Stations on the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, and from the Panama Canal Zone. Two HS-1Ls operating from Chatham, Massachusetts made the only confirmed aircraft attack on a German U-boat in American waters on July 21, 1918, but this was unsuccessful, with bombs failing to explode and the submarine escaping.Owers 1999, p.68. From August 1918, in order to compensate for Canada's lack of patrol aircraft, US Navy HSs operated from two bases in Nova Scotia. Twelve HS-2Ls were donated to Canada at the end of the war. An HS-2L over Pensacola, Florida in the 1920s. Large numbers of HS boats were also used by US Navy forces in France, with deliveries starting on May 24, 1918, flying their first patrols on June 13. About 160 HS-1Ls and -2Ls were deployed to France.Owers 1999, p.70.Bowers 1979, p.102. Following the Armistice, the HS boats based in Europe were scrapped apart from four aircraft based in the Azores, which were acquired by Portugal, while the US Naval Air Service shrank considerably, with many Naval Air Stations closing, resulting in considerable numbers of HS boats becoming surplus to requirements and available for sale at $200 to $500 without engines.Owers 1999, p.71. HS-2Ls continued in use by the US Navy as a patrol aircraft and a trainer until 1928. Following the Armistice, eleven HSs passed into US Coast Guard service, remaining in service until 1926.Owers 1999, p.75. As many as 83 HS boats were used by the United States Army Air Service for communications and survey purposes from overseas bases, although they were not given US Army serial numbers. Surplus HSs were also widely exported. Amongst Military users was Brazil, who received six aircraft in 1918. Two HS-2Ls were used in an attempt to bomb the rebel held Forte de Copacabana during the 1922 Tenente revolt. Many were used in Canada as the first bush plane. One survives in the Canada Aviation Museum in Ottawa after being rescued from a Quebec lake. Variants An HS-1 in 1917. * HS-1 - prototype with Curtiss engine.Bowers 1979, p.101.

Angola's three main guerrilla groups agreed to establish a transitional government in January 1975. Within two months, however, the FNLA, MPLA and UNITA had started fighting each other and the country began splitting into zones controlled by rival armed political groups. The MPLA gained control of the capital Luanda and much of the rest of the country. With the support of the United States, Zaïre and South Africa intervened militarily in favour of the FNLA and UNITA with the intention of taking Luanda before the declaration of independence. In response, Cuba intervened in favor of the MPLA, which became a flash point for the Cold War. With Cuban support, the MPLA held Luanda and declared independence on 11 November 1975, with Agostinho Neto becoming the first president, though the civil war continued. José Eduardo Dos Santos became the first elected President of Angola from the MPLA-LT and continued to get the support of Cuba. Background Jonas Savimbi, the leader or UNITA, the major opposition party Angola was a colony of Portugal for more than 400 years from the 15th century. The demand for independence in Angola picked up momentum during the early 1950s. The Portuguese régime, refused to accede to the demands for independence, provoking an armed conflict that started in 1961 when freedom fighters attacked both white and black civilians in cross-border operations in northeastern Angola, which was called the Colonial War. The principal protagonists included the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), founded in 1956, the National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA), which appeared in 1961, and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), founded in 1966. After many years of conflict that weakened all of the insurgent parties, Angola gained its independence on 11 November 1975, after the 1974 coup d'état in Lisbon, Portugal, which overthrew the Portuguese régime headed by Marcelo Caetano. Portugal's new revolutionary leaders began in 1974 a process of political change at home and accepted independence for its former colonies abroad. In Angola a fight for dominance broke out immediately between the three nationalist movements. The events prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens, creating up to 300 000 destitute Portuguese refugees—the retornados. The new Portuguese government tried to mediate an understanding between the three competing movements, which was initially agreed by the movements, but later disagreed. After it gained independence in November 1975, Angola experienced a devastating civil war which lasted several decades. It claimed millions of lives and produced many refugees; it didn't end until 2002. José Eduardo dos Santos who won and became the President of Angola in the elections Following negotiations held in Portugal, itself experiencing severe social and political turmoil and uncertainty due to the April 1974 revolution, Angola's three main guerrilla groups agreed to establish a transitional government in January 1975. Within two months, however, the FNLA, MPLA and UNITA had started fighting each other and the country began splitting into zones controlled by rival armed political groups. The MPLA gained control of the capital Luanda and much of the rest of the country. With the support of the United States, Zaïre and South Africa intervened militarily in favour of the FNLA and UNITA with the intention of taking Luanda before the declaration of independence. In response, Cuba intervened in favor of the MPLA, which became a flash point for the Cold War. With Cuban support, the MPLA held Luanda and declared independence on 11 November 1975, with Agostinho Neto becoming the first president, though the civil war continued. At this time, most of the half-million Portuguese who lived in Angola – and who had accounted for the majority of the skilled workers in public administration, agriculture, industries and trade – fled the country, leaving its once prosperous and growing economy in a state of bankruptcy. Cuban intervention in Angola Cuban intervention in Angola is believed to have started during the 1960s, but the actual deployment of troops started only by 1975 when Angola got independence from Portugal. Experts see ideological confluence between Cuba and MLPA of Angola and also the common Portuguese roots. Cuba had been supportive to Angola in resisting a series of attacks by the combined forces of South Africa and their sponsored guerillas UNITA over the oil reserves in Cabinda coast. United States were trying to broker peace by seeking systematic withdrawal of troops of Cuba from the region with the simultaneous reduction of troops by South Africa. The neutrality of US was questioned after it started supporting UNITA. President José Eduardo Dos Santos of Angola resisted pressure from United Nations for the withdrawal of troops of Cuba quoting South African attacks in Angola from 1981-85. Angola also received support in terms of teaching, construction workers and doctors, the gap left on account of migration of Whites from the nation soon after the independence. Cuban soldiers allegedly received greater acclaim in the home country and were proud to be part of the troops to Angola. There were also allegations that Cuban soldiers contracted AIDS while at Angola, but it was strongly denied. Declaration The declaration was a confirmation of a joint declaration by the two governments made 4 February 1982. The declaration reaffirmed that Angola and Cuba “will resume, by their own decision and in exercise of their sovereignty, the execution of the gradual withdrawal of the Cuban internationalist military contingent as soon as the following requisites are fulfilled; * 1. The unilateral withdrawal of the racist South African troops from Angolan territory. * 2. The strict application of Resolution 435-78 of the UN Security Council, the accession of Namibia to its true independence, and the total withdrawal of the South African troops that are illegally occupying that country. * 3. An end to any act of direct aggression or threat of aggression against the Republic of Angola on the part of South Africa, the United States of America, and their allies.” The declaration also demanded an end to the support of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola), and other organizations by South Africa, the United States, and their allies. The declaration was signed by José Eduardo Dos Santos, the President of Angola during his visit of Cuba with the Cuban chief Fidel Castro. Santos gave a statement that \\"The Governments of Cuba and Angola reiterate that they shall restart, on their own decision and exercising their sovereignty, the implementation of the gradual withdrawal as soon as the conditions are met.\\" See also * Alvor Accords * Angolan Civil War * Bicesse Accords * Cuban intervention in Angola * Nakuru Agreement References Category:1984 in Angola Category:1984 in Cuba Category:Treaties of Cuba Category:Treaties of the People's Republic of Angola Category:Treaties concluded in 1984 Category:Angola–South Africa relations Category:Angola–Cuba military relations Category:South African Border War Category:March 1984 events in Africa Category:March 1984 events in North America ","title":"Angola–Cuba Declaration of 1984"},{"id":"14991507","text":"KOWB (1290 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a news talk information format licensed to operate in Laramie, Wyoming, United States.

By issuing it, Bolesław planned to guarantee that his heirs would not fight among themselves, and would preserve the unity of his lands under the Piast dynasty. However, he failed; soon after his death his sons fought each other, and Poland entered a period of fragmentation lasting about 200 years.Norman Davies, God's Playground, page: 60 Provisions Bolesław III issued the document around January 1115 (between the birth of his son Leszek and the rebellion of Skarbimir); it would be enacted upon his death in 1138.Norman Davies, God's Playground, pages: 53 accessed 7 January 2008 Poland subdivided into five provinces among the sons of Bolesław Bolesław divided the country into five principalities: * the Seniorate Province (or Duchy of Kraków), composed of western Lesser Poland, the eastern parts of Greater Poland, western Kuyavia and the lands of Sieradz, assigned to Bolesław's eldest son and future High Duke Władysław II, as well as the lands of Łęczyca which were held by Bolesław's widow Salomea of Berg for life and to revert to the Seniorate Province upon her death; * the Silesian Province (or Duchy of Silesia), comprising Silesia, also assigned to Władysław II; * the Masovian Province (or Duchy of Masovia), composed of Masovia proper and eastern Kuyavia, assigned to Bolesław's III second son Bolesław IV the Curly; * the Greater Poland Province (or Duchy of Greater Poland), composed of the remaining western parts of Greater Poland, assigned to the third son Mieszko III the Old, * the Sandomierz Province (or Duchy of Sandomierz), composed of eastern Lesser Polish territories centered around the city of Sandomierz, assigned to the fourth son Henry of Sandomierz. The youngest son Casimir II the Just was not assigned any province; it is speculated that he was born after Bolesław's death, or he was destined for a religious career. The senioral principle established in the testament stated that at all times the eldest member of the dynasty (the Senior Prince, the Princeps or High Duke) was to have supreme power over the rest (Dux, the Dukes) and was also to control an indivisible \\"seniorate province\\" : a vast strip of land running north–south down the middle of Poland, with Kraków (the Kingdom of Poland's capital) its chief city. The Senior's prerogatives also included control over the Pomeranian vassals in Pomerelia, a fief. The Senior was tasked with defense of borders, the right to have troops in provinces of other Dukes, carrying out foreign policy, supervision over the clergy (including the right to nominate bishops and archbishops), and minting of currency. Aftermath The senioral principle was soon broken, with Władysław II attempting to increase his power and his younger half-brothers opposing him. After initial success (taking over the Łęczyca Land after the death of Salomea), he was eventually defeated and expelled from Poland in 1146. With the help of Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa his sons managed to retain the Silesian Province in 1163, losing the Seniorate, which had passed to their uncle Bolesław IV. This led to a period of nearly 200 years of Poland's feudal fragmentation; the estrangement of the Silesian Piasts deepening after the death of Duke Henry II the Pious at the disastrous Battle of Legnica in 1241. The Polish throne at Kraków remained contested between the descendants of Bolesław's III sons. Once Duke Władysław I the Elbow-high, a descendant of Bolesław IV, was crowned King of Poland in 1320, he would reign on a smaller dominium, with Pomerelia lost to the State of the Teutonic Order and Silesia mostly vassalized by the Kingdom of Bohemia.

C. Williamson in Australia. He also appeared in other stage roles in London, New York, and elsewhere, and made some silent films in America. Brownlow's adventures as a youth included an apprenticeship at sea, service with the Cape Mounted Rifles in South Africa, brief stints as a journalist, a banker and a gold miner, before being attracted to the stage. He performed with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company from 1884 to 1891. There he had the opportunity to create the roles of Harrington Jarramie in Mrs. Jarramie's Genie, Lieutenant Colmondeley in The Yeomen of the Guard (both in 1888) and Luiz in The Gondoliers (1889). He left the company to create the roles of Prince John in Arthur Sullivan's grand opera Ivanhoe and the Duc de Longueville in La Basoche (both in 1891). He next played in a number of comic operas in London through 1893, the year that he petitioned for divorce from his first wife, another member of the D'Oyly Carte. With J. C. Williamson in Australia, Brownlow appeared in Ma mie Rosette (1894) and in a revival of H.M.S. Pinafore (1895). In Australia in 1897 he re- married. In 1900 he appeared in more Gilbert and Sullivan roles in Australia, and as The Sultan in The Rose of Persia, Abercoed in Florodora, and in A Trip to Chinatown. In 1902 he was injured by falling through a door and recovered substantial damages. Still in Australia, he wrote the lyrics for several songs, but his alcoholism contributed to his failure in a venture managing a hotel. He took his family to the United States by 1904, where he appeared in several Broadway productions of comic operas and in some silent films. He returned to Australia, but his alcoholism soon ended his career, and he committed suicide there in 1919 Early life Brownlow was born in Westminster, London, in 1861, one of five children of Charlotte née Burrough (1831–1891) and Edward Brownlow (1823–1891). In 1861 his father was a Sergeant in the Coldstream Guards,\\"Edward Brownlow\\", 1861 England Census for Middlesex, Westminster St John the Evangelist, Ancestry.com and by 1871 he was a Drill Master for the Chelsea Pensioners and the Yeoman of the Queen's Bodyguard.1871 England Census for Wallace Brownlow, London, Ancestry.com In an 1894 interview for the magazine Table Talk in Melbourne, Australia, Brownlow said that in 1874, aged 13, he left home as an apprentice on a 600 ton brig on a journey to Adelaide, remaining at sea until 1877 including a period aboard HMS Active off the Zulu Coast. In South Africa he tried his hand at vine cultivation but after a few months he joined the Cape Mounted Rifles, aged 17. As he looked old enough and could ride, the authorities did not insist upon the production of his birth certificate. Brownlow saw some service in the Baphuti campaign and was present at the capture of chief Morosi. When in September 1880 the Basuto rebellion broke out Brownlow, then a corporal, found himself among a detachment of 200 men besieged at Mafeteng by 6,000 Basutos under the command of chief Lorothodi. Brownlow received a gunshot wound and was promoted to sergeant. His gallant action at Ramabidikives village in February 1881 gained him a commission to lieutenant. Lieutenant Colonel Edward Brabant wrote in his dispatch: > I wish particularly to bring to notice the name of Sergeant Wallace > Brownlow, Cape Mounted Rifles who commanded the scouts, and by whose courage > and intelligence in keeping me thoroughly informed of the movements of the > enemy up to the moment of the charge I was enabled to place the men in the > position most favourable to receive the enemy's attack. Sergeant Brownlow > came in with the Basutos, one of them falling dead upon him and covering him > with blood.\\"Mr Wallace Brownlow\\", Table Talk, 22 June 1894, p. 6 As Sir Richard Cholmondeley in The Yeomen of the Guard, 1888 When the war ended in 1881 Brownlow left the Cape Mounted Rifles and became a journalist on the staff of an Orange Free State newspaper published half in Dutch and half in English. Making a little money he returned to England, enjoyed a holiday, and then, to please his father, took a position in a banking house in London. A month's trial convinced him to leave banking, and he went to Canada to visit his brother in Montreal before starting on a gold mining expedition to the Lake of the Woods, but the venture failed. By late 1883 Brownlow was back in London where he saw an advertisement offering to launch amateur performers who wished to turn professional, on payment of a £5 fee. Brownlow paid the fee and made his first appearance on a stage as a comic policeman at the Imperial Theatre in Westminster. The show failed, but it gave Brownlow the advantage of being able to state that he had some stage experience. D'Oyly Carte Opera Company Brownlow joined a D'Oyly Carte Opera Company touring company in 1884 and was assigned to the chorus. On 22 March 1884 he married fellow D'Oyly Carte member Sarah \\"Siddie\\" Symons (c. 1857–1911).\\"Siddie Symons\\", England & Wales, Civil Registration Marriage Index, 1837–1915 for 1884, Q1-Jan-Feb-Mar, Ancestry.com He travelled to the United States in 1885 in the chorus of The Mikado with D'Oyly Carte's first American Mikado company in New York City and Boston, Massachusetts. He next toured Germany and Austria with D'Oyly Carte in 1886. During this tour, Brownlow appeared as the Foreman of the Jury in Trial by Jury, his first principal role. He first appeared at the Savoy Theatre in London in the chorus in the original 1887 production of Ruddigore. As the understudy to Richard Temple, Brownlow played the character of Sir Roderick Murgatroyd in August 1887. With Decima Moore as Luiz and Casilda in The Gondoliers Brownlow continued in the chorus at the Savoy Theatre during the first London revivals of H.M.S. Pinafore, The Pirates of Penzance, and The Mikado. A one-act comic opera, Mrs. Jarramie's Genie, written by Frank Desprez and composed by Alfred Cellier and his brother Francois was the curtain raiser for these revivals, beginning in February 1888, and Brownlow created the role of the retired upholsterer, Harrington Jarramie. Brownlow created the role of Sir Richard Cholmondeley, the Lieutenant of the Tower of London in the next Savoy opera, The Yeomen of the Guard, in 1888 at the Savoy Theatre. Coincidentally, his father had been Drill Master of the Yeomen of the Queen's Body Guard.1871 Census PRO RG10/625 He next created the role of Luiz in The Gondoliers, which he played from the opera's premiere in December 1889 until April 1891. Brownlow left the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company to play Prince John in Arthur Sullivan's grand opera Ivanhoe and as the Duc de Longueville in La Basoche at the Royal English Opera House (both 1891). He next played in a number of comic operas in London through 1893, including the role of William in Blue-Eyed Susan, composed by F. Osmond Carr, at the Prince of Wales's Theatre in 1892. By this time Brownlow's marriage had deteriorated because of his serial infidelity. In 1893 he petitioned for divorce citing his wife's supposed adultery, charges she denied; she counter-petitioned in 1894 citing his alleged adultery with various women, charges he denied.Kurt Gänzl. \\"Cartesians: One madhouse, one suicide, one flight, uncountable infidelities and even a bit of singing\\", Kurt of Gerolstein, 9 July 2020\\"Brownlow v Brownlow v Webster\\", England & Wales, Civil Divorce Records, 1858–1918, 1893, Ancestry.com Australia, US, and later years Brownlow as The Sultan in The Rose of Persia Brownlow then travelled to Australia to work for J. C. Williamson, appearing in the 1894 production of Ma mie Rosette, with Nellie StewartInformation from Music Australia and in an 1895 revival of H.M.S. Pinafore in Sydney. In Australia in January 1897 he married Rhoda Ruth Janette Hay (1871–1958) and with her had a daughter, Dorothy Rhoda Brownlow (1897–1992). It is uncertain whether he was actually divorced from his first wife. In 1900 he appeared in both Sydney and Melbourne in H.M.S. Pinafore, The Pirates of Penzance, Iolanthe, and The Gondoliers as Giuseppe. Also in 1900 he played The Sultan in Arthur Sullivan's The Rose of Persia; Abercoed in Florodora; the title role in The Mikado; and appeared in A Trip to Chinatown.Hawera & Normanby Star, Volume XXXVX, Issue 5088, 15 January 1900, Page 2 By 1901 his first wife, Siddie, was in a workhouse in Hampshire.

Stewart wrote in her memoirs of Brownlow's great success with Australian audiences, the \\"ease and grace and dash\\" that he brought to his roles, his huge popularity with the women who pursued him, and of his weakness for alcohol that led to his unhappy end.Nellie Stewart, \\"My Life's Story,\\" John Sands, Sydney, (1923) While living in Australia, Brownlow wrote the lyrics for several songs, including those to the ballad \\"Without Thy Love\\", the music to which was written by fellow D'Oyly Carte artiste Charles Kenningham.

It was built in 1837 by the Paisley and Renfrew Railway; and, together with the station at Renfrew Wharf, was one of two terminal stations on the line. Both stations offered passengers and goods facilities.Whishaw (1842) History The station opened on 3 April 1837, with steam locomotive haulage on the gauge, (Scotch gauge) line.Awdry (1990), page 97 The intention was to both supplement and complete with passenger and goods services on the River Cart between Paisley and Renfrew. The station was entered through either carriage or foot-gates. These led to a booking office, with a passenger waiting room behind it; the upper floor, above, was reserved for the use of the manager. Behind this was the Train shed, which had two platforms running the whole length of the shed. There was a separate locomotive shed; and a goods warehouse, which had one railway line running through it. During the sumer months there was a half-hourly service, the journey took 12 minutes, with ten journeys in each direction per day. In 1842, to save money, the steam locomotive was replaced by horse haulage.  Closure  On 23 January 1866, train services were suspended on the line to enable the tracks to be doubled throughout; the line to be converted to Standard Gauge and for it to be connected to the Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway, at Arkleston Junction.Butt (1995).

He is portrayed by Chace Crawford in the television series of the same name. In the novels, he is considered the primary male character, always being fought over by the two most prominent females, Blair Waldorf and Serena van der Woodsen. Novel series Nate Archibald is a lacrosse player at the elite St. Jude's School for Boys. His mother, Anne Archibald, is a French socialite, and his father, Captain Archibald, is a former Navy captain and a wealthy banker. His closest friends are Chuck Bass, Serena van der Woodsen and Blair Waldorf. He has been dating Blair since middle school. However, Nate is shown to have deep, unresolved feelings for Serena. They have sex during the summer at a wedding. He reveals this to Blair in the first novel after Serena returns, and right before they were supposed to lose their virginity to each other, which causes their first breakup. He gets together with freshman Jenny Humphrey, but later dumps her for Blair for being too clingy. He and Blair have an on-again-off-again relationship throughout most of the novels. Nate's family resides in a stately townhouse off Park Avenue on the exclusive Upper East Side of Manhattan in New York City, and his mother's French socialite family owns a summer chateau in Nice. He is a fan of sailing like his father, and wished to do that instead of attending Yale with Blair, although he expressed interest in attending Brown University. At the end of the series he sails around the world with a friend of his father's, Captain Charles \\"Chips\\" White to avoid getting in between Blair and Serena again. In I Will Aways Love You, on break from Deep Springs College, Nate chooses Blair in part I and then Serena in part II.

Kincraig Lake Ecological Reserve is one of fourteen Biological Heritage Sites (BHS) in Blackpool. A BHS provides a refuge for rare and threatened plants and animals. Wildlife Greylag geese on Kincraig Lake There is a variety of wildlife seen at the reserve. In winter 2007 the local Fylde Bird Club organised a Christmas Bird Hunt around the Fylde and recorded the following birds at Kincraig Lake – grey heron, mallard, mute swan, Canada geese, shoveller, teal, mallard, coot, moorhen, sparrowhawk, little grebe, starling, magpie, long-tailed tit, snipe, grey wagtail, greylag geese, black-headed gull, goldcrest, blue tit, gadwall, tufted duck, great crested grebe and great spotted woodpecker.

The group's first priority being to repair the footpaths which circumnavigate the entire lake at a cost of about £10,000, which would improve disabled access to the lake. The group's first meeting was held on 29 January at the local community centre in nearby Stronsay Place. As well making a priority improvements to the footpaths it was also agreed to beginning regular \\"litter picks\\", and to hold monthly Friends meetings. On 11 February it was revealed that Blackpool Probation Service has offered to send teams to clear out debris at two small ponds in the area, Kilmory Place pond and Dumfries Place pond. Also the priorities for the Friends include new footpaths, signs and repairs to benches with the main priority being to see the footpaths upgraded to improve access to, and around, the lake.

After quickly building a career as a soloist, winning many awards and distinctions and touring cities such as Sienna and Paris, she became a founding member of the Radio Televisión Española Symphony Orchestra. At just 18 years old, she became the Chair Professor of Harp at Madrid’s Real Conservatorio Superior de Música, the youngest Chair Professor in the history of music in Spain, with her field of work now including performance, teaching, and research.  Education  Calvo- Manzano graduated from the Royal Superior Music Conservatory of Madrid with an \\"Extraordinary Conservatory Degree Achievement\\" recognition. She has a Masters in Philosophy and Human Arts, a PhD in Architecture from the Department of Architectural Graphical Ideation at the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, and a second PhD in History from the Department of History and Thought at the University San Pablo-CEU of Madrid.  Career  Nieuwe Kerk in Haarlem, Netherlands) In 1976, her debut at Carnegie Hall in New York receiving positive reviews from critics, and the New York Times recognized her as a ground-breaking harpist who was revolutionizing contemporary harp with her sound and technique. Following her debut concert, she was named by the City of New York as the Best Young Foreign Artist of the Year. Calvo-Manzano has written essays about pedagogy, historiography, and musicology. She has concentrated her efforts on the critical study of Spanish works, particularly on those written for harp, and has researched manuscripts with important paleographic contributions. Her books have been published by ARLU publications, a branch of Association Arpista Ludovido (Ludovido Harpist Association). She has published in specialized magazines and has collaborated in the publishing of music dictionaries and reference books on music history. In addition, Calvo-Manzano has recorded several albums, mostly dealing with Spanish music and a style known as \\"ludoviquiano\\". These albums were produced with the purpose of remembering the legendary figure of Ludovico, a harpist in the High Renaissance period and Chamber Musician to the Catholic Monarchs. Calvo-Manzano has published editions of critical studies on works by Spanish composers included in her repertoire. Calvo-Manzano created a didactic technique, known as the ARLU Technique, which is used in courses at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Madrid Complutense University) and at the RCSM de Madrid. Many music school and conservatory professors in Spain are former students of Calvo-Manzano, and her foreign students have spread her harp and didactic theories. The method consists of understanding the instrument in more than simply musical terms. Her search to equip the harp with a technique that is not only dynamic but also expressive in the application of musical effects with a purist approach, appropriate to the era's tendencies and aesthetics, has dubbed her a true innovator in harp technique. She is recognized as the founder of the modern Spanish school of harp. She has also been frequently visited by foreign students who have been attracted by her achievements as a concert harpist and scholar. In many cases, her students pursue their PhD under her guidance. In 1988, the Ludovico Harpist Association was founded to safeguard the Spanish harp heritage and to celebrate Ludovico. In 1993, the association began the Harpist Ludovico International Harp Competition (Concurso Internacional de Arpa Arpista Ludovico) with the objective of encouraging talented young harpists. This competition has become one of the most important in the world with a simultaneous multicultural festival taking place in association with the competition. The competition takes place at the royal site of \\"Real Sitio de San Lorenzo de El Escorial\\" every three years with Calvo-Manzano as the main patron. In 2000, she donated her personal harp heritage collection, which included historical instruments and a library of specialized documents, to the foundation with the purpose of providing the coming generations with a document base of instrumental organology and assets with more than 10,000 volumes related to art, history, philosophy, and music. She has also started the Spanish Chamber Music Group \\"Ludovico Harpist\\" which carries out the task of releasing works of Spanish chamber music, which are often dedicated to Calvo-Manzano, and published and recorded by ARLU Association. She has been appointed a member of the Academy of Fines Arts and Historic Sciences of Spain.

Due to tasting dragon’s blood, Katya is able to speak with animals and is also able to speak and understand foreign languages. In Nippon, Katya is able to help a kitsune stop an evil sorceress from conquering the island and gains a valuable gift. The gift is an origami crane that can be sent to pass messages to people Katya knows or magically target someone who she needs. The Sea King sends her on another reconnaissance mission to Led Belarus, under the suspicion that it is too quiet and is a target for evil forces. Katya finds out that Prince Sasha is using his powers as a Seventh Son, a Fortunate Fool, and a Songweaver to subtly manipulate the Tradition into making Led Belarus a peaceful and prosperous kingdom. As the pair has no royal duties to fulfil, they decide to spend time with each other and fall in love. Soon Katya is sent on another mission, to investigate the disappearance of magical maidens near the castle of the Katschei. In disguise, Katya is kidnapped and taken to the castle by a Jinn. Since he has taken over the castle, the Tradition forces him to kidnap young women, the Jinn uses that to his advantage and kidnaps magical young women so he can take their magic. Although the Jinn is able to sense when the women use magic, Katya tries to convince the others to escape. She sends out her paper bird to seek help from the nearest Champions. When no sign of Katya arrives, Sasha decides to go after her despite not knowing her location. On the guidance of some witches, Sasha travels to the forest where Baba Yaga resides because she has something he needs. Sasha pretends to be a deaf-mute and becomes Baba Yaga’s temporary servant. Baba Yaga sets him up with the task of cleaning her stables where he meets Sergi, the Humpbacked Horse and frees him along with Baba Yaga’s steed, a Wise (intelligent) goat, and her tracker, a Wise Wolf. During the escape, Sasha ends up in the Kingdom of the Copper Mountain and is able to convince its Queen to help him. She sends him towards the Sea King and the Sea King sends him to two Dragons, the champions who found Katya’s bird. Meanwhile, Katya and the growing number of girls are able to work out they can use the Law of Names to re-seal the Jinn into his bottle. However finding the bottle itself proves difficult in a castle guarded by men and the Jinn himself. Sasha and the dragons, Gina and Adamant, try to work out a plan to save the girls and stop the Jinn. The trio also manage to convince the Queen of the Copper Mountain to lead them aid. Using Sergi as a messenger, the captives and the rescuers are able to work out a plan of attack. Katya sends the girls to escape via tunnels dug by the Copper Mountain subjects and sets out to confront the Jinn with help from the dragons and Sasha. The battle becomes a stalemate until the Queen appears to lend them the power of Earth. Katya seals the Jinn in his bottle and has Sergi send him back to the City of Brass. In the epilogue of the story, the castle of Katschei becomes the Belarus Chapter of the Champions Order of Glass Mountain. The majority of the cast are affiliated with the order and spend their time living happily ever after. Trivia * The novel references the film Finding Nemo when the characters mention that all sea birds say is \\"Mine\\". * The novel also contains a few references to previous villains of Lackey's novels. The castle was previously owned by a Katschei who tried to defy the Tradition and was defeated in The Fairy Godmother, and several characters reference their fear of Chernobog, a demonic, godlike figure who is the main villain of the Heirs of Alexandria series. * The City of Brass, where the djinn are said to live, is the name of a story in the Arabian Nights, as well as being the planar home of djinn and efreets in Dungeons & Dragons. * The Queen of the Copper Mountain is based on the character the Mistress of the Copper Mountain.

The series was created by Irving Vendig, who also created the serial The Edge of Night. The serial focused on a law firm that was dealing with a high profile murder case throughout its 127-episode run; the main romantic angle had the firm's senior partner, Arthur Adams, becoming involved with client Kate Logan, a female surgeon accused of murder, which Adams and partner Nick Turner acquitted her of. Charles Fisher was the producer of the program, which was an in-house NBC production. The show was an production of NBC, and was the only NBC-owned soap opera at the time. (The network was later to own How to Survive a Marriage and to purchase The Doctors from that show's sponsor Colgate-Palmolive.) The show's leading stars were Conard Fowkes as Adams, Gretchen Walther as Logan, and Tony Lo Bianco as Turner. Others in the cast included Linda Blair, Robin Braxton, Ludi Claire, Betsy Durkin, Joseph Daly, Rita Gam, Lloyd Hollar, Stephen Joyce, John Karlen, Nat Polen, Roy Scheider, Louise Shaffer, and Grethen Walther. Broadcast history Hidden Faces replaced Let's Make a Deal at 1:30 p. m. (12:30 Central) after disputes between NBC and the packagers of Let's Make a Deal Stefan Hatos and Monty Hall caused the game/participation show to move to ABC. Facing the ABC Let's Make a Deal and CBS' As the World Turns, Hidden Faces performed poorly and, in an unusual move for daytime serials in that era, was cancelled after only six months in favor of the Bill Leyden-hosted game You're Putting Me On. With almost all of the fans of Let's Make a Deal's following their show to ABC, Hidden Faces could not get a foothold among viewers, since soap opera fans instinctively preferred the then-top-rated As the World Turns. Hidden Faces was the first of eight programs that NBC put in the timeslot of Let's Make a Deal between its departure and the expansion of Days of Our Lives to an hour on April 21, 1975. Of those eight shows, only Three on a Match lasted longer than a year. No episodes of this program are known to still exist, the tapes likely having been erased by NBC, per the standard practices of that time.

Among them were Lori Lee Farmer, 8, Doris Denise Milner, 10, and Michelle Heather Guse, 9. The girls were residents of Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, a suburb of Tulsa. They were sharing tent #8 in the camp's \\"Kiowa\\" unit which was located the farthest from the Camp Counselor's tent, and partially obscured by the showers for the camp. At around 6 a.m. on June 13, a camp counselor on her way to the shower found a girl's body in her sleeping bag in the forest. It was soon discovered that all three girls in tent #8 had been killed. Their bodies had been left on a trail leading to the showers, about 150 yards from their tent at summer camp. Subsequent testing showed that they had been raped, bludgeoned, and strangled. A large, red flashlight was found on top of the girls' bodies; a fingerprint was found on the lens, but it has never been identified. A footprint from a 9.5 shoe size was also found in the blood in the tent. Between 2:30 and 3 a.m. on June 13, a landowner heard \\"quite a bit\\" of traffic on a remote road near the camp.  Aftermath  Camp Scott was evacuated and was later shut down. = Suspect = Gene Leroy Hart (November 27, 1943 - June 4, 1979) had been at large since 1973 after escaping from the Mayes County Jail. He had been convicted of kidnapping and raping two pregnant women as well as four counts of first degree burglary. Hart was raised about a mile from Camp Scott. Hart, a Cherokee, was arrested within a year at the home of a Cherokee medicine man. He was represented by Garvin A. Isaacs, a local Oklahoma attorney. He was tried in March 1979. Although the local sheriff pronounced himself \\"one thousand percent\\" certain that Hart was guilty, a local jury acquitted him. On June 4, 1979, he collapsed and died of a heart attack, after about an hour of lifting weights and jogging in the prison exercise yard. Two of the families later sued the Magic Empire Council and its insurer for $5 million, alleging negligence. The civil trial included discussion of the threatening note and the fact that tent #8 was from the counselors' tent. In 1985, by a 9–3 vote, jurors decided in favor of Magic Empire. By that time, Hart was already dead. As a convicted rapist and jail escapee, he still had 305 years of his 308-year sentence left to serve in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary. = DNA testing = In 1989, DNA testing was done and proved that in DNA testing at the time three of the five probes matched Hart's DNA. Statistically, DNA from 1 in 7,700 native americans would obtain these results. In 2008, authorities conducted new DNA testing on stains found on a pillowcase, the results of which proved inconclusive because the samples were \\"too deteriorated to obtain a DNA profile\\". In 2017, $30,000 in donations were raised by the sheriff in order to do new DNA tests using the latest advances in testing. = Legacy = Richard Guse, the father of one of the three victims, went on to help the state legislature pass the Oklahoma Victims' Bill of Rights. He also helped found the Oklahoma Crime Victims Compensation Board. Another parent, Sheri Farmer, founded the Oklahoma chapter of Parents of Murdered Children, a support group.

It widely found in southern Africa, inhabiting grasslands. In one of the countries it lives in, Swaziland, it is listed as a Near Threatened species. The Cape grass lizard is ovoviviparous. A discovery has shown females are not breeding at the same time in a year. This lizard has three subspecies. They are the C. a. anguina, the C. a. oligopholis, and the C. a. tenuior. Distribution The Cape grass lizard is widely distributed in the grasslands of southern Africa. It has been reported in South Africa, Swaziland, Angola, Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, the Republic of the Congo, and Uganda. The grasslands that the Cape grass lizard inhabits often have wildfire. Breeding The Cape grass lizard is ovoviviparous, meaning eggs will stay inside the mother until they are ready to hatch. The average clutch size is three to seventeen eggs. A discovery has revealed that females are breeding throughout the year. This adaptation is probably to prevent the total loss of reproductive gain in a year due to fire. Subspecies The Cape grass lizard has three known subspecies. * C. a. anguina - This subspecies was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. * C. a. tenuior - In 1895, Albert C. L. G. Günther described this subspecies. * C. a. oligopholis - Laurent described this subspecies in 1964. Conservation The Southern African Red Data and the IUCN Red List do not mention the Cape grass lizard. However, the Swaziland Red Data has the lizard listed as Near Threatened. The Transvaal grass lizard is also listed as a Near Threatened species.

Licensed to Clearmont, Wyoming, United States, the station serves the Sheridan, Wyoming area. It is currently owned by Lovcom, Inc. All Lovcom stations are located in the Sheridan Media Radio Center, at 1716 KROE Lane on Sheridan's east side. History The station was assigned the call sign KLQQ on June 6, 2006. The official sign-on occurred at 5pm MDT on Friday, June 30, 2006. The first song played was \\"Get The Party Started\\" by Pink. Broadcasting on 104.7 FM at 2,000 watts, KLQQ was the first radio station launched in the Sheridan, Wyoming, area with simultaneous analog and HD Radio programming. Two HD Radio multicast channels were added to the signal two weeks after the official sign-on. Originally, the HD-2 channel carried a Hip hop format and HD-3 was \\"JokeJoke,\\" a 24-hour comedy format. In July 2006, the multicast channel lineup changed to Oldies on HD-2 and ESPN Radio on HD-3. In October 2007, KLQQ increased power to 100,000 watts and moved to 104.9 FM. The HD Radio multicast channel lineup went through several changes, but through most of 2008 the lineup was Smooth Jazz on HD-2 and ESPN Radio on HD-3. In October 2008, the HD-3 channel was eliminated (The ESPN Radio channel was moved to another multicast channel on a sister station) and the bandwidth on the HD-2 channel increased to equal that of the HD-1 channel. At the same time the HD-2 channel programming was changed to the \\"AC Pure\\" format provided by Waitt Radio Networks, becoming the first HD Radio multicast affiliate for the network. The HD-2 channel was called \\"Magic 95.9\\" due to the HD-2 channel also being available on analog translator K240DW at 95.9 FM through a loophole in FCC rules regarding translators. On June 15, 2012, the HD-2 format was changed to Active Rock as \\"95.9 The Edge\\" and the \\"Magic\\" format was moved to a new analog signal on KOWY at 102.3 FM. Equipment failures forced KLQQ to cease HD Radio broadcasting in 2013, and the Active Rock format was moved to KZWY-HD3. In 2016, KLQQ dropped from a class C0 to a class C1 and reduced ERP from 100,000 Watts to 31,000 Watts. KLQQ's analog FM signal is also translated on K253AZ in Gillette, WY at 98.5 FM.

Originally built by the Akron Aircraft Company later renamed Funk Aircraft Company. Development The Model B was the first powered aircraft designed by brothers Howard and Joe Funk, whose previous experience was in homebuilt gliders and sailplanes. The Model B was a strut-braced high-wing monoplane with a conventional tail unit and fixed tailwheel landing gear. The design uses mixed construction with fabric-covered wooden wings and a welded steel-tube fuselage. The aircraft was powered by the brothers' own Model E engine developed from a Ford \\"B\\" motor- car engine. The prototype first flew in late 1933.Simpson, 2005, p. 141 Production and operations When the test flights proved to be successful the brothers formed the Akron Aircraft Company in 1939 to build the Funk B. After production began, the engine was changed to a 75 hp (56 kW) Lycoming GO-145-C2 horizontally-opposed four-cylinder engine and was re-designated the Model B-75-L. In 1941 the company moved from Akron to Kansas and the company was renamed the Funk Aircraft Company. Production was stopped during the Second World War and one aircraft was impressed into service in 1942 with the United States Army Air Corps as the UC-92. After the war in 1946 production was resumed using a Continental C85-12 engine and the aircraft was redesignated the Model B-85-C and named the Bee.

It is situated on the South West Coast Path between Westward Ho! to the north and Bucks Mills to the west. There is also a path descending from Horns Cross on the A39 road. The small stream of Peppercombe Water is a little over a kilometre long, but its valley is relatively deep. It ends in a waterfall consisting in a series of cascades, each between 0.5 and 1.5 metres high, that have formed due to the unequal hardness of the different beds of the underlying rock. The seaward section of Peppercombe is at the eastern end of the Hobby to Peppercombe biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI),See for details of the Hobby to Peppercombe SSSI. while the coast section to north-east is part of the Mermaid's Pool to Rowden Gut geological SSSI.  Geology  Peppercombe beach looking east to Portledge A noticeable feature of the sea cliffs between Peppercombe and Portledge to the north is their distinctive red colour. Whereas the rocks of the surrounding areas form part of the Bude Formation of the Upper Carboniferous, those in the Peppercombe are an outlier of a later, presumably Permian age. These rocks extend for about 2km inland, and consist of breccias with scattered calcareous bands and nodules, with occasional beds of sand and sandstone. This outlier is thought to be a remnant of the New Red Sandstone that formerly covered a much larger part of Devon, having been eroded away in geological times.; ; cf. . This has a much more extensive outcrop in south-eastern Devon. It is thought that these rocks are derived from sediment deposited by rainstorm floods in an otherwise dry desert area situated on the fringes of a rugged highland.  Peppercombe Castle  Peppercombe Castle is an Iron Age Hill fort situated on the cliffs immediately to the west of the valley. The remains of the fort are hard to define from maps and it may well be that much of the site has been lost to coastal erosion, but it would seem to have been at around 80 m above sea level.
