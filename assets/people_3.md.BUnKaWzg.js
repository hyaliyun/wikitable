Kennedy International Airport in New York City. On September 21, 2005, Captain Scott Burke executed an emergency landing in the Airbus A320-200 at Los Angeles International Airport after the nose gear jammed in an abnormal position. No one was injured. Incident Carrying 140 passengers and six crew, the Airbus A320-232 departed Burbank at 3:17 p.m. PDT (UTC-7). The aircraft, which was built in 2002, bore the tail number and the name \\"Canyon Blue.\\" It was scheduled to fly to John F. Kennedy International Airport. After takeoff from Burbank, the pilots realized that they could not retract the landing gear. They then flew low over Long Beach Municipal Airport (LGB) in Long Beach (the location of a JetBlue hub) to allow officials in the airport's control tower to assess the damage to its landing gear before attempting a landing. It was found that the nosewheel was rotated ninety degrees to the left, perpendicular to the direction of the fuselage. Rather than land at Long Beach Airport, the pilot-in-command made the decision that the aircraft would land at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), in order to take advantage of its long, wide runways and modern safety equipment. The pilots flew the aircraft, which can carry up to of aviation fuel, in a figure eight pattern between Bob Hope Airport in Burbank and LAX for more than two hours in order to burn fuel and lower the risk of fire upon landing. This also served to lighten the plane, reducing potential stress on the landing gear and dramatically lowering landing speed as well. The Airbus A320 does not have the mechanical ability to dump fuel, despite various news agencies reporting that the aircraft was doing so over the ocean. Because JetBlue planes are equipped with DirecTV satellite television, passengers on Flight 292 were able to watch live news coverage of their flight while the plane circled over the Pacific for hours. The in-flight video system was turned off \\"well before landing.\\" Actress Taryn Manning was on the flight on her way to New York to promote the film Hustle & Flow. Screenwriter Zach Dean was also on the plane, and while contemplating his mortality resolved to write a script about mortality (which eventually became the film Deadfall). Emergency services and fire engines were standing by on the LAX ramp ahead of the landing. Although foam trucks were available, they were not used. The U.S. FAA no longer recommends pre-foaming runways, chiefly due to concerns that it would deplete firefighting foam supplies which might later be needed to respond to a fire; it is also difficult to determine exactly where a runway should be foamed, and pre- foaming might also reduce the effectiveness of the aircraft's brakes, potentially causing it to slide off the runway. Los Angeles Fire Dept. Battalion Chief Lou Roupoli said, \\"The pilot did an outstanding job. He kept the plane on its rear tires as long as he could before he brought [the nose gear down].\\" When the nose gear did touch down, there were sparks and flames from it, but no apparent damage to the rest of the plane. At 6:20 p.m. PDT (UTC-7), the aircraft came to a stop very close to the end of the runway 25L. In an attempt to keep the nose gear off the ground as long as possible, reverse thrust was not used to slow the aircraft. The pilots therefore used a much larger portion of the available runway than in a typical landing, stopping before the end of the runway, validating the decision to divert from Long Beach, where the longest runway is . Aftermath and evaluation Passengers began to disembark less than seven minutes later. The landing was smooth and no physical injuries were reported. The aircraft was evacuated via airstairs, as opposed to evacuation slides typically used in an emergency situation. As JetBlue did not operate from LAX at the time, the aircraft was towed to a Continental Airlines hangar at LAX for evaluation. Expert opinion expressed was that, despite the drama and live worldwide coverage, there was little real danger to the passengers or crew of Flight 292. The A320, like all modern airliners, is engineered to tolerate certain failures, and, if necessary, can be landed without the nose gear at all. The media reported that this was at least the seventh occurrence of an Airbus A320 series aircraft touching down with the landing gear locked ninety degrees out of position, and one of at least sixty-seven \\"nose wheel failures\\" on A319, A320 and A321 aircraft worldwide since 1989. Earlier incidents included another JetBlue flight bound for New York City, a United Airlines flight into Chicago, and an America West flight into Columbus, Ohio. While some incidents were traced to faulty maintenance and denied as a design flaw by Airbus Industries, the manufacturer had issued maintenance advisories to A320 owners which were later mandated as Airworthiness Directives by American and French aviation authorities.NYC99IA062 Messier-Dowty, which manufactures nose gear assemblies for the A320, stated in an NTSB report in 2004 that part of the gear had been redesigned to prevent future problems, but at the time the redesign was awaiting approval. Mechanics familiar with this common fault usually replace or reprogram the Brake Steering Control Unit (BSCU) computer. The NTSB report says that worn-out seals were to blame for the malfunction, and that the BSCU system contributed to the problem. The NTSB reported that Airbus had since upgraded the system to take care of the problem. Following the incident, the aircraft was repaired and returned to service still bearing the name \\"Canyon Blue.\\" The flight route designation for JetBlue's flights from Burbank to New York was changed from 292 to 358 (the other direction became 359).

Description The play features the characters of Albert Einstein and Pablo Picasso, who meet at a bar called the Lapin Agile (French: \\"Nimble Rabbit\\") in Montmartre, Paris. It is set on October 8, 1904, and both men are on the verge of disclosing amazing ideas (Einstein will publish his special theory of relativity in 1905 and Picasso will paint Les Demoiselles d'Avignon in 1907). At the Lapin Agile, they have a lengthy debate about the value of genius and talent, while interacting with a host of other characters. Each character in Lapin Agile has a specific role. For example, Schmendiman, an inventor, believes he is a genius but really knows very little, while Gaston, an amicable old Frenchman with prostate problems, is hesitant to listen to or believe anything that does not revolve around sex or drinking. There is much discussion of the major cultural influences of the twentieth century. Picasso represents art, Einstein represents science, and Schmendiman represents commercialism. Picasso and Einstein eventually realize that their abilities are equally valuable. Once the main characters have reached their moment of insight, \\"The Visitor\\", a man from the future, crashes the party. Although the Visitor is never named, his identity can be surmised as Elvis Presley. The Visitor adds a third dimension to Picasso's and Einstein's debate, representing the idea that genius is not always the product of academic or philosophical understanding, or as Gaston refers to it, \\"Brains\\". Martin has written: \\"Focusing on Einstein‚Äôs Special Theory of Relativity and Picasso‚Äôs master painting, Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, the play attempts to explain, in a light-hearted way, the similarity of the creative process involved in great leaps of imagination in art and science\\". Cast, in order of appearance *Freddy ‚Äì The owner and bartender of the Lapin Agile. He is the boyfriend of Germaine, and seems to be a simple-minded man but occasionally says something truly stunning, and occasionally breaks the fourth wall. *Gaston ‚Äì An abrupt and direct old Frenchman with prostate problems, who talks plainly and only seems to care about sex and drinking *Germaine ‚Äì A waitress at the Lapin Agile. She is Freddy's girlfriend and a very thoughtful and beautiful woman. She has many ideas of what the 20th century will be like, and has slept with Picasso. *Albert Einstein ‚Äì A 25-year-old scientist with big aspirations. He is a genius, with a book on the way called The Special Theory of Relativity. He often finds himself having to explain his theories and thoughts in a simpler fashion to the rest of the group, as he is wise beyond his years. *Suzanne ‚Äì A beautiful 19-year-old girl who is infatuated with Picasso. Suzanne and Picasso have already slept together, and she is left hurt and angry when he doesn't remember her. *Sagot ‚Äì Picasso's art dealer, who is obsessed with finding and selling great pieces of art for profit *Pablo Picasso ‚Äì A talented and charismatic 23-year-old painter. Extremely egotistical and self-confident, he is a serial womanizer and master of manipulation. *Charles Dabernow Schmendiman ‚Äì A young inventor with huge dreams and little knowledge. Although he is hardworking, he is overshadowed by the genius and talent of Einstein and Picasso. *The Countess ‚Äì An extremely intelligent and attractive woman, with whom Einstein is infatuated. She thinks like he does, being the one person to really understand him in the play. *A Female Admirer ‚Äì A young admirer Picasso assumes is a fan of his, but who turns out to be an admirer of Schmendiman *The Visitor ‚Äì A polite and talented country-boy time-traveler, who adds another dimension and point of view to Einstein's and Picasso's debate. He is a blue-suede-shoed musician. Productions St Albans, UK Picasso at the Lapin Agile was the first full- length play written by Steve Martin. The first reading of the play took place at Steve Martin's home in Beverly Hills, California. Tom Hanks read the role of Picasso, and Chris Sarandon read Einstein. Martin then held a nine-day professional workshop of the play in Melbourne, Australia, at the Malthouse Theatre (in conjunction with Belvoir St Theatre), which ended with two public staged readings of the play. Following this, the play opened at the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago, Illinois, on October 13, 1993. \\"Picasso At The Lapin Agile\\" (Oct. 13, 1993 - May. 12, 1994) The show then enjoyed a successful run at the Westwood Playhouse (now known as the Geffen Playhouse) in Los Angeles, California. Finally, the show made its way to New York City. The play has also had successful runs in other American cities. Martin made several attempts to create a film version of the play, but none came to fruition. On November 27, 2006, Martin announced on his website that \\"there is no movie of Picasso at the Lapin Agile in the works\\". Steves Message to You  Controversy  The play was pulled from La Grande High School in La Grande, Oregon in March 2009 following a parent-led petition with 137 names opposed to the staging of the play. The petitioners objected to some of the adult themes and content, in response to which Martin wrote that the students knew that the \\"questionable behavior sometimes evident in the play is not endorsed\\". In his letter to La Grande Observer, he compared the characterization that the play is about \\"people drinking in bars and treating women as sex objects\\" to summarizing Shakespeare's Hamlet as being \\"about a castle\\". Martin responded to the banning of the play at La Grande High School with an offer to underwrite a production of the play at an alternative location, stating he did not want the play to acquire \\"a reputation it does not deserve\\".

Accessed April 1, 2020. History The school was founded as Lower Camden County Regional High School in 1939, in Lindenwold. It served students from up to ten municipalities at one point. The population soon began to grow, however, and Edgewood Regional High School (now Winslow Township High School) was founded in Winslow Township. The school took the name Overbrook Regional Senior High School in the 1950s, and joined its sister school Edgewood as part of Lower Camden County Regional High School District #1. Soon, the student population became too large for the now 60+ year old building to handle, and the current building was erected in 1969 in Pine Hill. The former building became known as Overbrook Regional Junior High School. Overcrowding again became an issue in the late 90s, as Overbrook Junior High School was serving Berlin Township, Clementon, Lindenwold, Pine Hill, and portions of Winslow Township. In 1999, each of the individual school boards voted to dissolve LCCRHSD. Lindenwold would build its own high school and take over the old junior high building to make it the district's middle school. Edgewood Regional Junior High became Winslow Township Middle School, and Edgewood Senior High became Winslow Township High School. Pine Hill would build Pine Hill Middle School in the forested area next to the school. Over the next decade, the population at Overbrook slowly faded from a high of over 1700 students to a new low of just under 800 students. After 28 years at Overbrook, Paul J. Harmelin retired as principal following the 2012‚Äì13 school year. His replacement starting in the 2013‚Äì14 school year was Don Borden. Adam Lee was hired as the Principal in July 2015.

Plot The player assumes the role of William Crowe, an American who experiences the various phases of the Pacific War with Japan, beginning with the Pearl Harbor attack in December 1941. Crowe's brother Charlie is killed during the attack. He is restationed at Wake Island where he comes under the command of Admiral Daniel Howells. He later participates in escorting Howells off the island as it is about to fall to the Japanese. When they make it to the Lexington, Crowe gets a new squadron consisting of Cunningham, Murphy, Slater, and commanded by Callahan. The Battle of the Coral Sea, the Battle of Midway, Guadalcanal, and the Marshall Islands are all featured in one or more missions. The final mission of the campaign is on February 23, 1945 with the raising of the United States flag on Iwo Jima. Gameplay There are six game modes: Campaign, Instant Action, Single Mission, Historical, Training, and Multiplayer. One or two players can play simultaneously on the console or up to eight players can play on the network via Xbox Live or using a PlayStation 2 with network adapter. There are two different control schemes for flying the planes, Arcade and Professional. The Arcade control scheme allows for easier control of the plane via a single joystick with automatic rudders, while the Professional controls offer separate control of the pitch, roll and yaw of the plane. Heroes of the Pacific also offers multiple difficulty levels: Rookie, Pilot, Veteran, and Ace. Completing missions on higher difficulty unlocks more planes and rewards the player with more upgrade points, which can be used to upgrade your unlocked aircraft after missions are accomplished. This simulation also allows players to pilot famous planes such as the P-40 Warhawk, P-51 Mustang, F4U Corsair, P-47 Thunderbolt and a number of Japanese and German planes from World War II, including several experimental planes, such as the Blohm & Voss BV P.215 and the J7W Shinden.

Background Lascelles was born in 1797. He was the second son of Henry Lascelles, 2nd Earl of Harewood, and Henrietta Sebright, daughter of Sir John Sebright, 6th Baronet. Military service Lascelles was commissioned as an ensign in the 1st Foot Guards in 1814 and fought in the Battle of Waterloo when he was slightly wounded by an exploding shell when carrying the standard of his (Second) battalion of the regiment. He went onto half-pay in 1820, the year he began to serve part-time as a lieutenant in the Yorkshire Hussars Yeomanry in 1820, but he did not fully retire from the regular army until 1831. History of Parliament Online article. Public life He sat as Member of Parliament for Northallerton from 1826 to 1831 and also served as Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire between 1846 and 1857.

Their line-up consisted of Marilyn Rovell (later Marilyn Wilson-Ruthorford), her sister Diane Rovell, and their cousin Ginger Blake. The group were a kind of female counterpart to the Beach Boys, described as \\"the world's first female surfing vocal combo\\" by Music Vendor in April 1963. Bandleader Brian Wilson served as the Honeys' record producer and chief songwriter, and later married Marilyn in late 1964. After 1969, they remained mostly inactive. In the 1970s, Marilyn and Diane formed another short-lived group, American Spring, also with participation from Wilson.  Background  The Honeys (a slang term for girls or girlfriends, and specifically for female surfing enthusiast) consisted at first of sisters Barbara, Diane and Marilyn Rovell, performing under the name of the Rovell Sisters. Their cousin Sandra Glantz later replaced Barbara, and joined the group as Ginger Blake. They were discovered on the amateur talent show circuit by producer Gary Usher, who featured Blake on his 1961 single \\"You‚Äôre the Girl\\"/\\"Driven Insane\\", and the whole band as the Usherettes in 1963 on \\"Three Surfer Boys\\"/\\"Milky Way.\\" Marilyn and Diane had met the Beach Boys when the boys performed at a Hollywood club called Pandora's Box in late 1962. Usher presented the band to frontman Brian Wilson, who started their collaboration by changing their name to the Honeys, after a line from the Beach Boys' \\"Surfin' Safari\\". Brian and Marilyn (who was still in high school) began dating, and he took the girls into the recording studio to produce their songs. He brought the Beach Boys in as backing vocalists on \\"Surfin' Down the Swanee River,\\" and the Honeys as backup performers on Beach Boys records: the cheerleader voices on the re-recording of \\"Be True to Your School\\" were performed by the Honeys, and the two groups sometimes shared the same concert bill. They have also been known as the Westwoods on an 1963 unreleased single, \\"Miss My Little Surfer Boy,\\" and as Ginger & the Snaps during the mid-1960s.  Career  In 1963 and 1964, the Honeys released a number of singles on Capitol and Warner Brothers, with minimal to modest regional success. The songs were either written, arranged, or produced by Brian Wilson. Among their other studio work, they also sang background vocals for The Beach Boys on the hit \\"Be True To Your School\\", for Bruce Johnston on the title song from his album Surfin' 'Round The World, and for Jan and Dean on the hit singles \\"The New Girl In School\\", \\"Dead Man's Curve\\", and \\"The Little Old Lady from Pasadena\\". The Honeys' career faded as surfing music went out of vogue. Marilyn and Brian were married and became the parents of Carnie and Wendy Wilson, who later found fame as members of Wilson Phillips. Blake left the band to create her own publishing company and pursue her solo backing career. Marilyn and Diane later re-teamed as a duo called American Spring during the 1970s, also under the production eye of Brian Wilson. In the 1980s, the band reunited to record two studio albums, Ecstasy and It's Like Heaven. During the 1990s, the Honeys reunited and performed locally around Los Angeles. An anthology CD of their music (including several American Spring recordings) also was released by Capitol Records in 1992. On March 10, 2016, two of The Honeys participated in concert at the Coffee Gallery Backstage in Altadena, California as part of a tribute to their long-time friend and 1960s songwriting legend P.F.

The exam is based on the premise that a person requires at least two of the three following senses to maintain balance while standing: proprioception (the ability to know one's body position in space); vestibular function (the ability to know one's head position in space); and vision (which can be used to monitor and adjust for changes in body position). A patient who has a problem with proprioception can still maintain balance by using vestibular function and vision. In the Romberg test, the standing patient is asked to close their eyes. An increased loss of balance is interpreted as a positive Romberg's test. The Romberg test is a test of the body's sense of positioning (proprioception), which requires healthy functioning of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord. The Romberg test is used to investigate the cause of loss of motor coordination (ataxia). A positive Romberg test suggests that the ataxia is sensory in nature, that is, depending on loss of proprioception. If a patient is ataxic and Romberg's test is not positive, it suggests that ataxia is cerebellar in nature, that is, depending on localized cerebellar dysfunction instead. It is used as an indicator for possible alcohol or drug impaired driving and neurological decompression sickness. When used to test impaired driving, the test is performed with the subject estimating 30 seconds in their head. This is used to gauge the subject's internal clock and can be an indicator of stimulant or depressant use.  Procedure  Romberg's position Ask the subject to stand erect with feet together and eyes closed. Stand close by as a precaution in order to stop the person from falling over and hurting themself. Watch the movement of the body in relation to a perpendicular object behind the subject (corner of the room, door, window etc.). A positive sign is noted when a swaying, sometimes irregular swaying and even toppling over occurs. The essential feature is that the patient becomes more unsteady with eyes closed. The essential features of the test are as follows: # the subject stands with feet together, eyes open and hands by the sides. # the subject closes the eyes while the examiner observes for a full minute. Because the examiner is trying to elicit whether the patient falls when the eyes are closed, it is advisable to stand ready to catch the falling patient. For large subjects, a strong assistant is recommended. Romberg's test is positive if the patient falls while the eyes are closed. Swaying is not a positive sign as it shows proprioceptive correction. Patients with a positive result are said to demonstrate Romberg's sign or Rombergism. They can also be described as Romberg's positive. The basis of this test is that balance comes from the combination of several neurological systems, namely proprioception, vestibular input, and vision. If any two of these systems are working the person should be able to demonstrate a fair degree of balance. The key to the test is that vision is taken away by asking the patient to close their eyes. This leaves only two of the three systems remaining and if there is a vestibular disorder (labyrinthine) or a sensory disorder (proprioceptive dysfunction) the patient will become much more unbalanced.  Physiology  Maintaining balance while standing in the stationary position relies on intact sensory pathways, sensorimotor integration centers and motor pathways. The main sensory inputs are: # Joint position sense (proprioception), carried in the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, the dorsal and ventral spinocerebellar tracts. # Vision # Vestibular apparatus Crucially, the brain can obtain sufficient information to maintain balance if any two of the three systems are intact. Sensorimotor integration is carried out by the cerebellum and by the dorsal column-medial lemniscus tract. The motor pathway is the corticospinal (pyramidal) tract and the medial and lateral vestibular tracts. The first stage of the test (standing with the eyes open with hands on hips), demonstrates that at least two of the three sensory pathways are intact, and that sensorimotor integration and the motor pathway are functioning. The patient must stand unsupported with eyes open and hands on hips for 30 seconds. If the patient takes a step or removes a hand from the hip, the timer is stopped. The patient may make two attempts to complete the 30 seconds. Similar to the sensory organization test, the visual pathway would then be removed by closing the eyes. If the proprioceptive and vestibular pathways are intact, balance will be maintained. But if proprioception is defective, two of the sensory inputs will be absent and the patient will sway then fall. Similar to the Romberg Test, the patient must stand unsupported with eyes closed and hands on hips for 30 seconds. The patient may make two attempts to complete the 30 seconds. A variation of the Romberg Test, the Sharpened Romberg Test, consists of narrowing the patient‚Äôs base of support by placing feet in a heel to toe position. Nonetheless, test instructions do not specify which foot, preferred or non-preferred, should be placed in front of the other. The patient should be instructed to keep hands on hips for the whole 30 seconds. If the patient takes a step or removes hands from hips, the timer is stopped and the patient may attempt the test one more time. The sharpened Romberg does have an early learning effect that will plateau between the third and fourth attempts. = Positive Romberg = Romberg's test is positive in conditions causing sensory ataxia such as: * Vitamin deficiencies such as Vitamin B * Conditions affecting the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, such as tabes dorsalis (neurosyphilis), in which it was first described. * Conditions affecting the sensory nerves (sensory peripheral neuropathies), such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). * Friedreich's ataxia * M√©ni√®re's disease  Romberg and cerebellar function  Romberg's test is not a test of cerebellar function, as it is commonly misconstrued. Patients with severe cerebellar ataxia will generally be unable to balance even with their eyes open;Blumenfeld H. Romberg Test. neuroexam.com. URL: http://www.neuroexam.com/content.php?p=37 . Accessed on: April 22, 2007. therefore, the test cannot proceed beyond the first step and no patient with cerebellar ataxia can correctly be described as Romberg's positive. Rather, Romberg's test is a test of the proprioception receptors and pathways function. A positive Romberg's test which will show wide base gait in patients with back pain has been shown to be 90 percent specific for lumbar spinal stenosis.  History  The test was named after the German neurologist Moritz Heinrich Romberg (1795‚Äì1873), who also gave his name to Parry‚ÄìRomberg syndrome and Howship‚ÄìRomberg sign.

History In 1602 Spanish explorer Sebasti√°n Vizca√≠no landed at this beach. Gaspar de Portol√†, during the Portola expedition, was encamped on this beach and rested here before deciding to return to San Diego because of low supplies and having failed to rendezvous with the Spanish supply ships. A cross commemorating the landing is on the beach. Recreational activities Carmel River State Beach is a popular spot for divers and kayakers, who can access the notable kelp forests in the area. It is also popular with birders, and is a stop on the Central Coast Birding Trail. The best seasons for birdwatching at Carmel River State Beach are fall and winter. Swimming on this section of the coast can be extremely dangerous because of the strong currents. Carmel River State Beach is considered especially dangerous for swimming as the steep drop-off from shore can minimize turbulent waves giving the mistaken impression of a calm sea.

The US Department of Energy (DOE) and a consortium of US utilities built this country's first two large-scale, demonstration solar power towers in the desert near Barstow, California.https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy01osti/28751.pdf Solar One/Solar Two have been scrapped since 2009, and Solar Tres is under construction. Solar One Solar One was a pilot solar-thermal project built in the Mojave Desert just east of Barstow, CA, USA. It was the first test of a large-scale thermal solar power tower plant. Solar One was designed by the Department of Energy (DOE) (led by Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore, California), Southern California Edison, LA Dept of Water and Power, and California Energy Commission. It was located in Daggett, CA, about east of Barstow. Solar One's method of collecting energy was based on concentrating the sun's energy onto a common focal point to produce heat to run a steam turbine generator. It had hundreds of large mirror assemblies, or heliostats, that track the sun, reflecting the solar energy onto a 328 ft (100 m) tall towerhttps://www.atlasobscura.com/places/solar-one-and-solar- two#:~:text=The%20first%20large%20scale%20solar,central%20100%20meter%20tall%20tower. where a black receiver absorbed the heat. High-temperature heat transfer fluid was used to carry the energy to a boiler on the ground where the steam was used to spin a series of turbines, much like a traditional power plant. In the late 1970s, a competition was held by the DoE to obtain the best heliostat design for the project. Several promising designs were selected and prototypes were built and shipped to the area for testing. Trade-offs involved simplicity of construction to minimize costs for high-volume manufacturing versus the need for a reliable, two-axis tracking system that could maintain focus on the tower. Rigidity of the structure was a major concern in terms of wind load resistance and durability, but shading of the mirrors by support structures was to be avoided. The project produced 7 MW of electricity using 1,818 heliostats of 40 m¬≤ (430 ft¬≤) reflective surface area each, with a total area of 72,650 m¬≤ (782,000 ft¬≤). Solar One was completed in 1981 and was operational from 1982 to 1986. Later redesigned and renamed Solar Two, it could be seen from Interstate 40 where it covered a 51 hectare (126 acre) site, not including the administration building or rail yard facilities shared with a neighboring plant. Solar One/Two and other nearby solar projects are plainly visible via satellite imaging software at . During times of high winds, blowing dust is sometimes illuminated by the reflected sunbeams to create an unusual atmospheric phenomenon in the vicinity of the power tower. These beams of light were depicted in several scenes, and a painting, in the 1987 movie Bagdad Cafe, which was filmed nearby. Nevada Solar One shares a similar name to Solar One, however it is quite different. It uses a solar thermal parabolic trough system and generates 64 MW. Solar Two One of Solar Two's heliostats is shown in 2003 with the solar power tower in the background In 1995 Solar One was converted into Solar Two, by adding a second ring of 108 larger 95 m¬≤ (1,000 ft¬≤) heliostats around the existing Solar One, totaling 1926 heliostats with a total area of 82,750 m¬≤ (891,000 ft¬≤). This gave Solar Two the ability to produce 10 megawatts‚Äîenough to power an estimated 7,500 homes. Solar Two used molten salt, a combination of 60% sodium nitrate and 40% potassium nitrate, as an energy storage medium instead of oil or water as with Solar One. This helped in energy storage during brief interruptions in sunlight due to clouds. The molten salt also allowed the energy to be stored in large tanks for future use such as night time‚ÄîSolar Two had sufficient capacity to continue running for up to three hours after the sun had set. Solar Two was decommissioned in 1999. In 2001, the University of California, Davis, received funding to convert it into an air Cherenkov telescope for measuring gamma rays hitting the atmosphere. The first astronomical observations were in the fall of 2004, and the last were in November 2005 This project was named C.A.C.T.U.S.. The facility was operated by the University of California, Davis but owned by Southern California Edison. Solar Two's 3 primary participants were Southern California Edison (SCE), the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). : \\"We're proud of Solar Two's success as it marks a significant milestone in the development of large-scale solar energy projects,\\" said then U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson. : \\"This technology has been successfully demonstrated and is ready for commercialization. From 1994 to 1999, the Solar Two project demonstrated the ability of solar molten salt technology to provide long-term, cost effective thermal energy storage for electricity generation.\\", Boeing On November 25, 2009, after 10 years of not producing any energy, the Solar Two tower was demolished. The mothballed site was levelled and returned to vacant land by Southern California Edison. All heliostats and other hardware were removed. Solar Tres Due to the success of Solar Two, a commercial power plant, originally called Solar Tres Power Tower, now known as Gemasolar Thermosolar Plant built in Spain by Torresol Energy using Solar One and Solar Two's technology for commercial electrical production of 15 MW. Solar Tres is three times larger than Solar Two with 2,493 heliostats, each with a reflective surface of 96 m¬≤. The total reflective area will be 240,000 m¬≤ (2.6 million ft¬≤). They will be made of a highly reflective glass with metal back to cut costs by about 45%. A larger molten nitrate salt storage tank will be used giving the plant the ability to store 600 MWh, allowing the plant to run 24/7 during the summer.

He was the King of the present-day southern Indian city of Kochi and his palace was in Thrissur, which was a part of the Kingdom of Cochin. The city of Thrissur is referred to as the Cultural Capital of Kerala owing to its many traditional festivals and historic temples. Sakthan Thampuran is considered the architect of the city of Thrissur. The festival Thrissur Pooram is considered to have been first started by him. BiographyEarly life= Born on 26 August 1751 AD at Vellarapally Palace to Anujan Namboodiripad of the Chennamangalam Mana and Ambika Thampuran of the Cochin Royal Family. His mother died when he was only three years old. The prince was brought up by his maternal aunt, famously known as Chittamma (meaning mother's younger sister) Thampuran. His early education took place under the tutelage of scholars such as Kallenkara Pisharody. Sakthan Thampuran was a considered as an extremely powerful Maharaja as his name indicates. =Marriage= A view of the entrance of Shakthan Thampuran Palace where he was cremated. Thampuran married twice. His first wife was a Nair lady from the reputed Vadakke Kuruppath family of Thrissur whom he married when he was 30 years old. He is said to have had a daughter with this first wife. However, this Nethyar Amma (title of the consort of the Cochin Rajah) died soon after an unhappy marriage. Thereafter the Thampuran remained unmarried for a few decades, marrying again at the age of 52. The second wife of Thampuran was Chummukutty Nethyar Amma of the Karimpatta family and was a musician and dancer of Kaikottikalli, a traditional dance form. She was 17 at the time of her marriage with the Thampuran. Thampuran died after 4 years of the marriage. At the time, widowed Nethyar Ammas did not receive monetary support from the state, so Chummukutty, at the age of 21, returned to her ancestral home. =Death= Tomb of Ramavarma Sakthan Thamburan, king Kochi.

He was buried in Shakthan Thampuran Palace, Thrissur. His palace in Thrissur City is preserved as a monument. He is considered to be responsible for the development of Thrissur City and also making it the Cultural Capital of Kerala. Administration In 1762, ten tehsils (Kovilakathum vathukkals) and two Edavagas (semi tehsils) were formed in the Kochi Kingdom. But the previous feudal chieftains maintained their stronghold. After Thampuran ascended the throne of Kingdom of Cochin , he took over the land from the feudal chieftains and consolidated the royal power. At that time, the Vadakkunnathan Temple and Peruvanam Mahadeva Temple were controlled by the Namboodiri community, called Yogiatiripppads. The Yogiatiripppads was elected from different temples in the Thrissur District. Thampuran wrested the control of the temples and abolished the system of Yogiatiripppads. Thampuran's strict approach with criminals earned his name, Sakthan. During the British Raj, British authorities had good relations with Thampuran. He was also a personal friend of Dharma Raja of Travancore. LegacyCity of Thrissur= A bird's view of Swaraj Round which was built by Sakthan Thampuran The modern day town of Thrissur owes its origin to Sakthan Thampuran. The reason for his love of the town was because his two wives were both born here. They belonged to the Kuruppath and Karimpatta families of Thrissur. Sakthan Thampuran transferred his capital from Thrippunithura to Thrissur to found the city. He cleared the teak forests around the Vadakkunnathan Temple and developed the Thekkinkadu Maidan, which is now at the heart of the city. After clearing the forest, he built a circular concrete road now known as Swaraj Round. =Thrissur Pooram= The Thrissur Pooram or \\"Mother of all Poorams\\", as it was known, was the brainchild of Sakthan Thampuran. At the time, Arattupuzha Pooram was the largest temple festival in Kerala. Temples in and around the city of Thrissur were regular participants. Once, they were denied entry to Arattupuzha Pooram because they were late. All the late participant temples went to Sakthan Thampuran, then Maharaja of Cochin, and complained about the issue. Thampuran invited all the temples to bring their deities to Thrissur and pay obeisance to Lord Shiva, the deity of the Vadakkunnathan Temple. Thampuran classified the participants into two groups, the Western and the Eastern. The Western group consisted of the Thiruvambady, Kanimangalam, Laloor, Ayyanthole, and Nethilakkavu temples while the Paramekkavu, Karamukku, Chembukavu, Choorakottukavu and Panamukkamppilly temples came under the eastern group. =Shakthan Thampuran Palace= Named after Shakthan Thampuran, the palace is spread over of Thrissur and was earlier known as Vadakkechira Kovilakam. It is one of the most historic cultural and architecturally relevant palace of the erstwhile Maharaja of Cochin, which has now been converted into a heritage museum. The palace is now a blend of traditional Kerala and Dutch architectural styles following its 1795 reconstruction.

Government of Alberta. January 31, 2006. Archived from the original on February 4, 2006. Retrieved September 20, 2017. in 2006. The Government of Alberta paid a dividend, nicknamed Ralph bucks, to residents of Alberta due to a massive oil-fuelled provincial budget surplus. Background - 2004 general election Notice for Klein's prosperity bonus would come less than a year following the 2004 Alberta general election which saw the Progressive Conservative Party of Alberta elected for the tenth consecutive majority government, and Klein continuing as Premier for the fourth straight term. Despite retaining power in Alberta the election showed cracks in the popularity of Premier Klein and the Progressive Conservative Party, which saw their share of the popular vote drop from 61.9 percent in 2001 to 46.8 percent. Prosperity bonus announcement In September 2005, Alberta Premier Ralph Klein announced in an open letter to Albertans that the province was expecting significant higher than expected revenue from energy royalties and the government would be creating a program to return a portion of the surplus to Albertans in the form of a one-time CA$400 payment sometime in January 2006. Previous government estimates had placed the 2005-06 budget surplus as $2.8-billion, however rising oil and gas prices had inflated this number to approximately $6.8-billion. The prosperity bonuses would total approximately $1.4-billion or 20 percent of the province's $6.8-billion surplus. The remainder of the $5.4-billion was allocated to other projects in the province. Prosperity bonuses were not subject to taxation by either the federal or provincial governments. The prosperity bonus cheques were commonly referred to as Ralph Bucks which was coined by Calgary Sun columnists Rick Bell and Chris Nelson after searching for a term to describe the payment. After the announcement Klein left the door open for the possibility of annual prosperity cheques similar to the annual dividends provided by the government of Alaska through the Alaska Permanent Fund since 1982. One-time issue of cheques Cheques were received by almost 3 million Albertans in 2006. However no further cheques were sent out. Klein resigned as premier later that same year, on December 14, 2006. Eligibility All Albertans who were residents of the province as of September 1, 2005, and filed a 2004 tax return with the Canada Revenue Agency received the bonus, except for prisoners, who did not qualify. Cheques for Albertans under 18 years of age were payable only to their primary caregiver (the mother in most cases), thus leaving parents to determine how their children's share was to be distributed or used. Homeless Albertans also qualified‚Äîthe government pledged to work with inner-city agencies to ensure that the homeless receive their money. Other questions were unanswered. For example, it was unknown how spouses fleeing abusive relationships would receive their bonus if they were housed in a shelter. Criticisms The program generated controversy both inside and outside Alberta. Although few Albertans turned down their cheques, some residents criticized what they saw as a pointless giveaway, and preferred to see the excess money put toward long-term benefits such as tax cuts or the abolition of health care premiums. Some said the program would generate resentment from Canadians outside Alberta who saw cheques delivered to every Albertan. Ralph Bucks made it into national media after a handful of non- Albertans came forward to admit they had received cheques to which they were not entitled, prompting criticism from the Canadian Taxpayers Federation. Following the prosperity bonus program, some Albertans dropped their approval of the cheque program. They began viewing the $400 cheques negatively in light of falling oil and gas prices in 2008, and again in the 2010s, which led to growing provincial debt and deficits in following years. Colourful as this quote is most Albertans do not drive Hummers - and appreciated the free money. Charity In a web poll by CTV Calgary, 5% of respondents said they would donate their prosperity bonus to charity.

It occurred during a press conference being conducted by Ed√©n Pastora, a leader of the Contras, who is presumed to have been the target. Seven people, including three journalists, were killed in the attack. Attack A press conference had been arranged in the guerrilla outpost of La Penca by Pastora, a former Sandinista who had switched allegiance to the Contras. The press conference took place in an enclosed hut on stilts, near the northern bank of the San Juan River, which separates Costa Rica from Nicaragua. The press conference had been convened by Contra officials in the Costa Rican capital of San Jos√©, and the journalists arrived to La Penca in the middle of the night after traveling all day over land and by canoe from San Jos√©. Because of the late hour, Pastora initially asked for the press conference to start in the morning, but as the reporters began peppering the guerrilla leader with questions, an impromptu press conference began, and the reporters and television news crews gathered with Pastora around a chest-high table situated in the main room of the hut. The bomb is believed to have been hidden in an aluminum camera case and planted by an individual carrying a stolen Danish passport. According to witnesses, the bomber used the name \\"Per Anker Hansen\\" and claimed to be a Danish photographer. Afterwards, bombing survivors commented that they found it odd that \\"Hansen\\" had so zealouly guarded his \\"camera equipment\\" by wrapping the unwieldy aluminum box in plastic. \\"Hansen\\" is believed to have deposited the camera case containing the bomb under the table. News footage later showed the suspected bomber gesturing to his camera, as if to indicate an equipment malfunction as a pretext to leave the room. The bomber is suspected to have detonated the bomb remotely using a Walkie-Talkie signal as a detonator. Seconds after \\"Hansen\\" left the room, an explosion ripped through the hut, which left the injured and dying crying out in pain and calling for help in sudden darkness. Those killed in the bombing were an American journalist, Linda Frazier; a Costa Rican cameraman, Jorge Quiros; his assistant, Evelio Sequeira; and four rebels. Also, Pastora was seriously injured in both legs. About a dozen other people were seriously injured. Investigation The bombing led to an investigation by Tony Avirgan, an American journalist injured in the bombing, and his wife, Martha Honey. Both concluded that the CIA was responsible. In 1986, the Christic Institute filed a $24 million lawsuit on their behalf against several individuals all associated with Oliver North, including Rob Owen, John Hull, Richard Secord, Albert Hakim, and Thomas Clines. However, the case was thrown out in June 1988, and the Christic Institute was ordered to pay approximately $1 million in costs to the defendants. In 1990, the government of Costa Rica accused the CIA of orchestrating the bombing by two intermediaries. Charges of murder were laid against Felipe Vidal, a Cuban-American, and John Hull, an American farmer who lived in Costa Rica at the time and had been previously named in the Christic Institute lawsuit. In 1993, Miami Herald reporter Juan Tamayo and Doug Vaughn, a freelance journalist working for the Christic Institute, established the identity of the alleged bomber to be an Argentine lefitist named Vital Roberto Gaguine, who had worked with the Sandinista militia in the early 1980s. Tamayo got a tip from a former member of Argentina's People's Revolutionary Army, who defected and was living in Europe and recognized news photographs of \\"Per Anker Hansen\\" to be a former member of the leftist group. Around the same time, Vaughn unearthed a photo of \\"Hansen\\" along with a right thumbprint from Panamanian government files. Argentine journalists obtained fingerprints of Gaguine from Argentine authorities and Vaughn and Tamayo took the two sets of prints to a fingerprint expert in Miami, who found a perfect match. Vaughn showed newsphotos of Gaguine to the alleged bomber's brother and father who confirmed the identification. According to Argentine journalists cited by Tamayo, Gaguine was among a group of guerrillas who died in an attack on the Argentine military base of La Tablada in 1989. However, in 2008, Costa Rica's chief prosecutor who saw Gaguine's file in Buenos Aires said that Argentine authorities never made a positive identification of Gaguine's body and that the case remains open. The association between the perpetrator and the FSLN led Tamayo to conclude that the Sandinistas were solely responsible. In an article in The Nation, Tony Avirgan concurred.\\"Unmasking the la Penca Bomber,\\" The Nation, 1993-09-06. In 2009, Swedish journalist and La Penca survivor Peter Torbi√∂rnsson broke 25 years of silence to reveal that he knew in advance of \\"Hansen\\"'s connection to the Sandinistas. He reported that he was introduced to the bomber in Managua by the Chief of Sandinista intelligence, a Cuban named Renan Montero. Torbi√∂rnsson took \\"Hansen\\" under his wing and provided journalistic cover as the two traveled throughout northern Costa Rica in search of Pastora. The Swede, who admitted sympathy with the Sandinista cause, said that he suspected his travel companion was a spy but that he had no idea he was an assassin. Even as journalists and news organizations spent years trying to crack the La Penca mystery, Torbi√∂rnsson kept silent about his knowledge of the bomber's Sandinista connection. However, tormented by the idea that he had been used as an unwitting accomplice to a terrorist attack, Torbi√∂rnsson finally broke his silence by traveling to Managua in January 2009, to present an accusation before Nicaraguan police authorities pointing to Montero, former Sandinista Minister of Interior Comandante Tom√°s Borge and Len√≠n Cerna, ex-chief of state security as intellectual authors of the attack. In 2011, Torbi√∂rnsson released a documentary film, Last Chapter, Goodbye Nicaragua, which premiered in the DocsBarcelona International Film Festival and renewed his accusation that Sandinista leaders Borge, Cerna, and Montero ordered the bombing. Torbi√∂rnsson also claimed that Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega admitted to him five years after the attack that the bombing had been orchestrated by his government but that Ortega later chose to cover it up and buy Pastora's silence and co-operation in exchange for a position within the second Sandinista administration.

He is best known as the founder of the Great Books program at St. John's College, at Annapolis, Maryland.The same program is used at St. John's College's second campus in Santa Fe, New Mexico which was founded in 1964. Buchanan's various projects and writings may be understood as an ambitious program of social and cultural reform based on the insight that many crucial problems arise from the uncritical use of symbolism. In this sense, his program was similar to and competed with a number of contemporary movements such as Alfred Korzybski's General Semantics, Otto Neurath's \\"Unity of Science\\" project, the semiotics of Charles Morris and the \\"orthological\\" projects of Charles Kay Ogden. Buchanan collaborated with the latter effort for a number of years. Buchanan's own program, however, differed from these generally empiricist, positivist, or pragmatist movements by stressing what he saw as the need for reforms in the mathematical symbolism employed in modern science. Buchanan's first book, published in 1927, stated that science is \\"the greatest body of uncriticized dogma we have today\\" and even likened science to the \\"Black Arts\\". For the rest of his career, Buchanan pondered ways to mitigate the variety of threats to humanity that he perceived in the unmanaged and unsupervised growth of modern science and technology. Background Scott Milross Buchanan was born on March 17, 1895, in Sprague, Washington and raised in Jeffersonville, Vermont. He received his undergraduate degree from Amherst College in 1916, majoring in Greek and mathematics. After serving in the Navy during the final year of World War I, he studied philosophy at Balliol College, Oxford as a Rhodes scholar between 1919 and 1921. He continued his studies in philosophy at Harvard University and received his doctorate in 1925. During his undergraduate years, Buchanan became personally close to Amherst's president Alexander Meiklejohn and was strongly influenced by Meiklejohn's ideas about educational reform. Career This continuing interest led Buchanan in 1925 to accept a position as Assistant Director of the People's Institute, an affiliate of the Cooper Union in New York City that was dedicated to adult education and other forms of cultural enrichment for the city's workers and immigrants. It was there that Buchanan met Mortimer J. Adler and Richard McKeon, and the three of them conceived an ambitious program for reviving American education and democracy through mass training in the traditional liberal arts by means of the Socratic method and the Great Books curriculum. Buchanan spent the next twenty years struggling to establish an institutional base for this radical vision. Buchanan's initial efforts at the People's Institute were followed by his establishment of the Great Books \\"Virginia Program\\" at the University of Virginia, where Buchanan was a Professor of Philosophy between 1929 and 1936. He was then invited to the University of Chicago by its president Robert Maynard Hutchins in order to help form a \\"Committee on Liberal Arts\\" in association with Buchanan's former People's Institute associates Adler and McKeon. However, this effort failed almost immediately due to philosophical differences and academic politics. Fortunately, another opportunity quickly arose in the form of St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland, a venerable institution with a heritage that reaches back to the colonial period, but which by 1936 had nevertheless lost its accreditation and was in desperate need of reorganization. In 1937, the trustees invited Buchanan and his associate Stringfellow Barr to make a fresh start. With Barr as president and Buchanan as dean, the two men reorganized the school that year around the Great Books \\"New Program\\". This radical new curriculum quickly achieved national fame and survives today. It is the achievement for which Buchanan is primarily remembered. Buchanan left St. John's College in 1947 after a successful but disillusioning legal struggle with the U.S. Navy, which had been trying to seize the St. John's campus as part of a plan to enlarge the nearby United States Naval Academy. After spending the next two years directing Liberal Arts, Inc., a failed venture to create a Great Books-based college in Massachusetts, Buchanan's democratic vision for the revival of the liberal arts turned from the academic to the political arena. Except for a brief period in 1956 and 1957, when he was a visiting lecturer at Princeton University and also served as chairman of the Religion and Philosophy Departments at Fisk University, he held no more positions in academic institutions. In 1948 Buchanan worked actively in the Progressive Party presidential campaign of Henry Wallace, and for several years afterwards was consultant, trustee, and secretary of the Foundation for World Government. In 1957 Buchanan accepted an invitation by Robert Maynard Hutchins to become a senior fellow at Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, a liberal political think tank in Santa Barbara, California. Buchanan remained at the Center for the rest of his career, and one of the projects to which he contributed was the Center's efforts to publicize the work of Jacques Ellul in the English-speaking world. Personal and death Buchanan died on March 25, 1968, in Santa Barbara. He was survived by his widow, the former Miriam Damon Thomas, and their son Douglas. Work * Possibility (1927): As part of C. K. Ogden's The International Library of Psychology, Philosophy and Scientific Method, this work was published simultaneously in the same series with Mortimer Adler's own first book Dialectic, and each book refers to the other. John Dewey praised Possibility as a \\"significant intellectual achievement\\". * Poetry and Mathematics (1929): Developed from materials for Buchanan's lectures at the People's Institute, this book was recognized by Richard McKeon, who had studied medieval philosophy under √âtienne Gilson, as a rediscovery of the medieval trivium and quadrivium. This insight of McKeon's, wrote Buchanan in 1961, is what led to the \\"radical reform of teaching and learning in a small province of the modern academy\\" for which Buchanan is remembered today. The American philosopher Morris Cohen praised Poetry and Mathematics as \\"an admirable piece of work.\\" * Symbolic Distance in Relation to Analogy and Fiction (1932): Appeared in London as part of Ogden's \\"Psyche Miniatures\\" series. Part of it had been published earlier in Psyche, the journal of Ogden's Orthological Institute. Although Buchanan later claimed that this work was inspired by a year's study of the English logician George Boole, it does not mention Boole. Rather, Symbolic Distance was obviously written in collaboration with Ogden's investigation of the linguistic theories of Jeremy Bentham, and Ogden cites Symbolic Distance in his own book Bentham's Theory of Fictions. This is the first of Buchanan's books to mention the medieval trivium and quadrivium. * The Doctrine of Signatures: A Defence of Theory in Medicine (1938): Also (like Possibility) as part of Ogden's International Library of Psychology, Philosophy and Scientific Method. A portion of the first chapter had appeared earlier in the 1934 issue of Psyche, under the title \\"Introduction to Medieval Orthology\\". * Truth in the Sciences (1950): Completed under contract to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica for a project that never materialized. The manuscript was published posthumously in book form by the University of Virginia in 1972 * Essay in Politics (1953): Stemming from his involvement with the 1948 Wallace campaign and later with the Foundation for World Government, Buchanan reflects on the problems of political representation and democracy that are posed by technology and industrialization. Buchanan continued to work on these ideas during his years at the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions.

Its primary focus is stabilizing the circadian rhythm disruptions that are common among people with bipolar disorder (BD). IPSRT draws upon principles from interpersonal psychotherapy, an evidence- based treatment for depression and emphasizes the importance of daily routine (rhythm). IPSRT was developed by Ellen Frank, PhD at the University of Pittsburgh who published a book on her theories: Treating Bipolar Disorder, a Clinician's Guide Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy. Her research on IPSRT has shown that, in combination with medication, solving interpersonal problems and maintaining regular daily rhythms of sleeping, waking, eating, and exercise can increase quality of life, reduce mood symptoms, and help prevent relapse in people with BD. __TOC__  Social Zeitgeber Hypothesis Zeitgebers (‚Äútime givers‚Äù) are environmental cues that synchronize biological rhythms to the 24-hour light/dark cycle. As the sun is a physical zeitgeber, social factors are considered social zeitgebers. These include personal relationships, social demands, or life tasks that entrain circadian rhythms. Disruptions in circadian rhythms can lead to somatic and cognitive symptoms, as seen in jet lag or during daylight saving time. Individuals diagnosed with, or at risk for, mood disorders may be especially sensitive to these disruptions and thus, vulnerable to episodes of depression or mania when circadian rhythm disruptions occur. Changes in daily routines place stress on the body‚Äôs maintenance of sleep-wake cycles, appetite, energy, and alertness, all of which are affected during mood episodes. For example, depressive symptoms include disturbed sleep patterns (sleeping too much or difficulty falling asleep), changes in appetite, fatigue, and slowed movement or agitation. Manic symptoms include decreased need for sleep, excessive energy, and increase in goal-directed activity. When the body‚Äôs rhythms becomes desynchronized, it can result in episodes of depression and mania.  Aims of Treatment  Goals of IPSRT are to stabilize social rhythms (e.g., eating meals with other people) while improving the quality of interpersonal relationships and satisfaction with social roles. Stabilizing social rhythms helps to protect against disruptions of biological rhythms; individuals are more likely to maintain a rhythm when other people are involved to hold them accountable. Interpersonal work can involve addressing unresolved grief experiences including grief for the lost healthy self, negotiating a transition in a major life role, and resolving a role dispute with a significant other. These experiences can be disruptive to social rhythms and thus, serve as targets of treatment to prevent the onset and recurrence of mood episodes seen in bipolar disorder.  Phases of Treatment  IPSRT typically proceeds in four phases: # The initial phase involves a review of the patient‚Äôs mental health history in order to elucidate patterns in the associations between social routine disruptions, interpersonal problems and affective episodes. Psychoeducation about BD and the importance of stable routines to mood maintenance is provided. Additionally, The Interpersonal Inventory is used to assess the quality of the patient‚Äôs interpersonal relationships. One of four interpersonal problem areas is chosen to focus on: ## Grief (e.g. loss of loved one, loss of healthy self) ## Role transitions (e.g. married-to-divorced, parenthood) ## Role disputes (e.g. conflict with spouse or parents) ## Interpersonal deficits (e.g. persistent social isolation) The Social Rhythm Metric (SRM) is used to assess the regularity of social routines. Target and actual time of the following activities are tracked on a daily basis: got out of bed; first contact with another person; started work, school, or housework; ate dinner; and went into bed. The intensity of involvement with other people is also rated: 0 = alone, 1 = others present, 2 = others actively involved, and 3 = others very stimulating. Finally, mood is rated on a scale of -5 to +5 at the end of each day. # The intermediate phase focuses on bringing regularity to social rhythms and intervening in the interpersonal problem area of interest. ## Social Rhythm Metric is heavily used to assess amount of activity being engaged in and the impact of activity on mood. The regularity (or irregularity) of activities is examined, and the patient and therapist collaboratively plan how to stabilize the daily routine by making incremental behavioral modifications until a regular target time at which these activities are done is achieved. ## Sources of interpersonal distress are explored, and individuals in the patient‚Äôs life who destabilize routine, along with those who are supportive, are identified. Frequency and intensity of social interactions, as well as other social rhythms (e.g. time at which returning home from school/work and then interacting with family), are discussed. # The maintenance phase aims to reinforce the techniques learned earlier in treatment in order to maintain social rhythms and positive interpersonal relationships. ## Discussion of early warning signs of episodes are reviewed. ## Symptomatic and functional change is monitored at each session by asking the patient to rate their mood and note any shifts in routine using the SRM. # The final phase involves termination in which sessions are gradually reduced in frequency.  Interpersonal Strategies  Once the interpersonal problem area of focus is chosen, the following strategies may be used: # Grief ‚Äì This refers to symptoms resulting from incomplete mourning or unresolved feelings about the death of an important person. This can also refer to grief for the loss of a healthy self (i.e., the person before the illness or the person one could have become, if not for BD). Strategies include encouraging expression of painful feelings about lost hopes, ruined relationships, interrupted careers, and passed opportunities. This is followed by encouragement to develop new relationships, establish new, more realistic goals, and focus on future opportunities. # Interpersonal role disputes ‚Äì This refers to any close relationship in which there are nonreciprocal expectations, such as in marital conflict and arguments with parental figures. Strategies include learning how to be more patient, tolerant, and accepting of limitations in self and others. This, in turn, can lead to fewer critical and argumentative instincts. # Role transition ‚Äì This refers to any major life role change, such as new employment, graduation, retirement, marriage, divorce, and giving birth. This can also refer to the loss of previously pleasurable hypomania. Strategies can include noting the negative consequences of hypomania and encouraging the identification of rewarding life goals as suitable alternatives. # Interpersonal deficits ‚Äì This refers to a long-standing history of impoverished or contentious social relationships, leading to an overall feeling of dissatisfaction. Strategies include identifying the common thread in the multiple disputes across one‚Äôs life and possibly working to restore ‚Äúburnt bridges‚Äù.  Social Rhythm Strategies  Individuals with BD benefit from a higher level of stability in their sleep and daily routines than those with no history of affective illness. It is important to identify situations in which routines can be thrown off balance, whether by excessive activity and overstimulation or lack of activity and under-stimulation. Once destabilizing triggers are identified, reasonable goals for change are established. Specific strategies include: # Encouraging proper sleep hygiene to introduce regularity to sleep-wake cycle ## Establish a regular wake and sleep time ## Avoid caffeine or other stimulants ## Use the bed only for sleep and sex, not for watching TV, doing homework, reading etc. ## Align sunlight exposure with wake time to help set circadian clock # Maintaining regular meal times throughout the day ## Plan ahead by meal prepping the day before ## Include snack times if needed to encourage consistent eating habits # Encouraging medication adherence and establishing a regular schedule ## Use alarms on phone as reminders for when to take pills ## Use daily pillboxes to keep track of which pills to take at certain times # Monitoring frequency and intensity of social interactions using Social Rhythm Metric ## Note time at which interactions happen and adjust accordingly to establish regularity # Minimizing overstimulation of social interactions ## Avoid frequent parties or events ## Use recovery days as needed # Addressing under-stimulation with behavioral activation ## Engage in activities that are pleasurable and that give one a sense of mastery ## Focus on small, manageable goals that can lead to engagement in other activities (e.g., start jogging to get in shape prior to joining a basketball team) # Identifying interpersonal sources of stabilizing and destabilizing influence ## Spend time with those who are supportive and stabilizing ## Reduce time with those who are disruptive  Evidence of IPSRT Efficacy  In a randomized controlled trial, those who received IPSRT during the acute treatment phase went longer without a new affective episode (depression or mania) than those who received intensive clinical management. Participants in the IPSRT group also had higher regularity of social rhythms at the end of acute treatment, which was associated with reduced likelihood of relapse during maintenance phase. Additionally, those who received IPSRT showed more rapid improvement in occupational functioning than those assigned to intensive clinical management. However, at the end of two years of maintenance treatment, there were no differences between treatment groups. IPSRT was studied as one of three intensive psychosocial treatments in the NIMH-funded Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD). STEP-BD was a long-term outpatient study investigating the benefits of psychotherapies in conjunction with pharmacotherapy in treating episodes of depression and mania, as well as preventing relapse in people with bipolar disorder. Patients were 1.58 times more likely to be well in any study month if they received intensive psychotherapy (cognitive-behavioral therapy, family focused therapy, or IPSRT) than if they received collaborative care in addition to pharmacotherapy. They also had significantly higher year-end recovery rates and shorter times to recovery. In a trial conducted by a separate research group, 100 participants aged 15-36 years with bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, and bipolar disorder not otherwise specified were randomized to IPSRT (n = 49) or specialist supportive care (n = 51). Both groups experienced improvement in depressive symptoms, social functioning, and manic symptoms, but there were no significant differences between the groups. = Adolescents = IPSRT was adapted to be delivered to adolescents with BD (IPSRT-A). In an open trial (N=12), feasibility and acceptability of IPSRT-A were high; 11/12 participants completed treatment, 97% of sessions were attended, and adolescent-rated satisfaction scores were high. IPSRT-A participants experienced significant decreases in manic, depressive, and general psychiatric symptoms over the 20 weeks of treatment. Participants‚Äô global functioning increased significantly as well. In an open trial aimed at prevention, adolescents (N=13) who were identified as high risk for bipolar disorder, due to having a first-degree relative with BD, received IPSRT. Significant changes in sleep/circadian patterns (i.e. less weekend sleeping in and oversleeping) were observed. Families reported high satisfaction with IPSRT, yet, on average, participants attended about half of scheduled sessions. Missed sessions were primarily associated with parental BD illness severity. = Group Therapy = IPSRT was adapted for a group therapy setting; administered over 16 sessions, in a semi-structured format. Patients (N=22) made interpersonal goals, reflected on how they managed their illness, and empathized with fellow group members. Patients were encouraged to react to each other from their own experience, express their feelings about what was said, and to give constructive feedback. Patients spent significantly less time depressed in the year following treatment than they did in the year prior to treatment. In another small trial, patients with BD who experiencing a depressive episode (N = 9) received six IPSRT-G sessions across two weeks. Topics of discussion in group included defining interpersonal focus area, defining target times for daily routines, discussing grief and medication adherence, addressing interpersonal disputes and role transitions, and reviewing IPSRT strategies and relapse prevention. Depressive symptoms improved significantly at the end of the treatment; improvements were maintained 10 weeks following treatment end.

It was designed by Chicago architect John Mills Van Osdel, and construction was carried out by William Mayes of the firm of Mayes and Oliver.http://www.uark.edu/rd_vcad/urel/info/campus_map/498.php G. N. Wright was one of the contractors.http://libinfo.uark.edu/specialcollections/findingaids/oldmainltr.html In 1873, the University of Arkansas purchased Van Osdel's plans for the University Hall at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (demolished in 1938) and erected an identical structure. The contract to construct the Hall was signed by the superintendent of public instruction, Joseph Carter Corbin, who was the highest elected African American official in Arkansas during Reconstruction. Most of the building materials used in Old Main came from local areas, because the nearest river port was 60 miles away and the nearest railroad was 150 miles away. 136 miles of lumber came by oxen-drawn wagons from the Peter Van Winkle Sawmill near historic War Eagle Mill in Benton County. The red exterior bricks were made from clay dug on campus and fired in kilns built west of Old Main. The brown sandstone used for the foundation and basement was also quarried from near the building site. The five-story building contained 2,600,000 bricks when originally constructed. After nearly a hundred years of use, Old Main had really begun to show its age, and in 1981 the building was closed for safety reasons. After a considerable period of debate over whether to restore the old building or tear it down, restoration work began in the summer of 1989 and Old Main was renovated extensively. The renovation proceeded ahead of schedule, and it was finished during the spring semester of 1991 at a cost of $10 million. It was rededicated during the Fall of 1991. Prior to the extensive restoration of 1986‚Äì1991, the building was fondly remembered for its large, open, and decorative central stairwell. However, this stairwell effectively formed a chimney which violated any number of building codes to which the renovated building would have to conform. To preserve the stairwell's appearance and function while still conforming to modern safety standards, an innovative automated fire protection system was installed which would slide out and close protective fire doors from concealed storage areas on each floor, effectively sealing the stairwell off. In the original building, stairwells were also sited at either end of the central \\"shotgun\\" hallway. These were closed off during the 1986‚Äì1991 restoration. Additional stairwells were sited at the ends of the wings, again to conform to building codes. The original 19th century Corinthian iron columns, featured prominently in almost all photographs of Old Main's wings, remain in place to this day. To conform to building codes, all but one floor's worth have been reinforced with welded steel and encased in fireproof boxes. The original columns in Giffels Auditorium were preserved in the renovation process. In order to preserve these columns while still conforming to building codes, they needed to be rendered non-structural. The north wing of the building was therefore completely reconstructed such that loads are carried by the walls instead of the columns. The distinctive \\"inset\\" look of the windows of the modern Giffels auditorium are a result of this restructuring and reinforcement. In 2005 the building underwent another round of renovations. At that time, it received a new roof, aging mortar was replaced, and a clock face was installed in the south tower. During its history, Old Main has housed many different departments and served many different administrative functions. It currently houses the offices of the J. William Fulbright College of Arts and Sciences, its honors program and five academic departments, as well as classrooms and meeting spaces.  Architectural features  The north tower stands 130 feet tall and the south tower stands 123 feet tall. The front doors of the building still retain their original hinges. The cornerstone of the building lists its original cost in 1871 dollars, $186,000. The sweeping stairwell leading to the attic of the building found at the center of the top floor is original to the structure. The walls of the rooms in the central \\"shotgun\\" hallway are structural and largely conform to the plan of the original building. The cast-iron sides of the seats in the Giffels auditorium are supposedly cast from original molds. = Arboretum = J. William Fulbright Peace Fountain in front of Vol Walker Hall. The arboretum (the large lawn area in front of Old Main) is a home to one of every type of tree in Arkansas (with a few exceptions, such as the umbrella magnolia, Magnolia tripetala) and once used to be a training ground for military officers when military tactics were taught at the University. It also served as a place where the band would march and play. Today, the band practices in Baum East (a parking lot on campus), and the arboretum is simply a green space where students can study, play games, or simply stroll through and enjoy. =James William Fulbright statue= In 2002, a statue of former student, law faculty member, president of the University, congressman,http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry- detail.aspx?entryID=1652 senator, and namesake of the college housed in Old Main, J.

That bell still exists today, but is no longer in regular use. The last two times it was used was when it rang 10 times in 1985 to mark the $10 million received through donations for the restoration process and in July 1989 to mark the beginning of renovation. Electronic bells were installed during 1949, and dedicated to those students lost in any war. These bells wore out and were replaced with a computerized bell device. It plays the Westminster Chimes every hour from 8 am- 8 pm, a musical selection after noon and the alma mater after five o'clock. = Senior Walk = Old Main from the front side where Senior Walk begins. Senior Walk is a tradition unique to the University of Arkansas. Senior Walk was established in 1905 by president John Tillman. Each year, all graduates have their name carved into the sidewalk that circles, and cuts through campus. The walk begins directly in front of Old Main with the first graduating class, of 1876. = Clock = Clock Mechanism on display on Fourth floor of Old Main Even though when Old Main was built, the southern tower was meant to hold a clock, one was not put in when the building was constructed. Although there was no clock face, the building did have a bellhttp://www.kincoconstructors.com/project- portfolio/project.asp?project_id=55&current;=&category;_id=17 in the opposite tower that rang every hour and half-hour and could be heard all over campus, as well as most of downtown Fayetteville and surrounding areas. When President Bill Clinton gave a much-anticipated speech at the J. William Fulbright statue dedication ceremony, Clinton asked Chancellor John White, \\"Where is the clock?\\"http://www.balzerclockworks.com/Current/Arkansas1.htmhttp://www.uatrav.com/2005/11/01/oldmaincomplete/ Three years later, Old Main received a clock face. On October 27, 2005, after more than 130 years without a functioning clock face, a specially constructed clock was completed and dedicated on the South Tower.http://chancellor.uark.edu/images/fall05chanletter.pdf This was in celebration of reaching a \\"Campaign for Twenty-First Century\\" campaign goal of $1 billion and also included the replacement of aging mortar between bricks, replacing the roof, and other minor aesthetic improvements to the building.

Kersh is a fictional character in the Fox science fiction television series The X-Files, played by James Pickens, Jr.. He serves as a figure of authority within the series, first introduced as an Assistant Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and is later promoted to the post of Deputy Director. Kersh acts as an antagonist who bureaucratically prevents Special Agents Fox Mulder, Dana Scully, John Doggett and Monica Reyes from investigating cases dealing with the paranormal, dubbed X-Files. Kersh first appeared as a guest role in several episodes of the series' sixth season, returning as a recurring character in the eighth and ninth seasons. Kersh's creation was driven by a need to place pressure on the character of Walter Skinner. The character has been met with mixed to negative critical responses, although he was initially positively received before coming to be considered a \\"one-note\\" role as the series progressed. Pickens, as part of the series' ensemble cast, earned a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for his work.  Character arc  Kersh's first appearance in the series was during the sixth season opening episode \\"The Beginning\\". As an Assistant Director, he temporarily became supervisor to Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) when they were assigned away from the X-Files division. During this time The Smoking Man could be seen in his office, reminiscent of his silent presence in Walter Skinner's office in early seasons. Kersh assigned Mulder and Scully mostly to menial tasks, such as terrorist details and Federal background checks. When they did investigate an X-File behind his back, Kersh would charge them for expenses they incurred on the case, forcing them to pay out of their own pocket. He also attempted to separate Mulder and Scully, believing that Mulder threw away a promising career as a criminal profiler, but that Scully's career could still be saved. When Mulder and Scully were reassigned to the X-Files office, Kersh continued to climb the ladder, culminating in an assignment as Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It was not long after his promotion that Mulder was abducted by aliens. At the beginning of the eighth season, Kersh assigned John Doggett (Robert Patrick) to run the manhunt for Mulder. When the manhunt failed, Doggett was assigned to the X-files with Scully, until Mulder was found in \\"This Is Not Happening\\". When Mulder returned, Kersh refused to assign him to the X-Files, keeping Doggett in that position. When Mulder and Doggett pursued an unauthorized case, Kersh was prepared to fire them both, but Mulder accepted full responsibility and was dismissed from the FBI. Shortly thereafter, Mulder disappeared again. After Doggett saw Kersh in a late night meeting with two conspirators, Knowle Rohrer and Gene Crane, Doggett brought in Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) to help him investigate Kersh's involvement in Mulder's disappearance. The investigation turned up nothing. Although Doggett seemed convinced that Kersh was involved in the conspiracy, Kersh insisted that he was actually protecting Mulder. During the ninth season, the Toothpick Man (Alan Dale), a key conspirator, could be seen in the company of Kersh, much like The Smoking Man before. During the series finale \\"The Truth\\", he sets up a kangaroo court to try Mulder and sentences him to death, deliberately ignoring evidence which would free him. However, he helps Doggett and Skinner free Mulder from a military prison. Following this, Kersh had to permanently close the X-Files to appease his irate superiors, which would remain closed until the season 10 episode My Struggle. Kersh returns in the eleventh season, where he maintains his same job and tasks Mulder and Scully with finding an AWOL Skinner.  Conceptual history  The character was named after Dr. Kersh and Anton Kersh, characters from Vampire Circus‚Äîa favourite film of series creator Chris Carter. According to writer and producer Frank Spotnitz, the creation of the Kersh character was due to the writers desiring to create another of the several characters in the series who put pressure on Walter Skinner. When reflecting on the casting of James Pickens, Jr., Spotnitz called him \\"another great find\\", adding that \\"so many times over the course of the series we just got so lucky with the actors that we cast in these guest parts and just kept bringing them back because they were so wonderful. That's what happened with William B. Davis as the Cigarette-Smoking Man and with Nick Lea as Krycek, and with Mitch Pileggi as Walter Skinner, and that's what happened here with James Pickens. Just a fantastic actor, not at all like this person, really transformed himself to play this part\\". Spotnitz thought that, for a viewer who had weekly been watching The X-Files sixth season, there was a great sense of gratification when‚Äîin the final moments of \\"One Son\\"‚ÄîSpender essentially withdraws and tells Kersh that Mulder has been right, all along, precisely because the last thing that Kersh wanted was for Spender to behave in this way. Pickens prepared for this role by observing several of Kersh's real-life counterparts at the FBI's Los Angeles office, where, according to the actor, the most useful thing he learned was that most of the people at Kersh's level had been with the Bureau for twenty or twenty-five years and had not reached their positions in the FBI hierarchy by taking their work less than seriously or bucking the system without good reason.Meisler, pp. 10‚Äì18. Robert Patrick, who portrayed John Doggett, recognized that his own character and Kersh were \\"both military men ‚Äì Air Force, Marines\\". Kersh was depicted as a United States Navy A-6 Intruder weapons officer during the Vietnam War. Both Patrick and director Kim Manners thought that, as Kersh, Pickens would \\"come in each week and just nail his stuff\\" regardless of what else was going on. Similarly, Frank Spotnitz thought that \\"Robert Patrick and James Pickens really had a chemistry, loved playing scenes together. And I think their scenes together were some of the finest ones in the last two years of the show.\\"  Reception  Michael Avalos, writing for the Knight Ridder Tribune, felt positively about the introduction of Kersh, saying he harbored \\"almost fond memories\\" of the former recurring character, Section Chief Scott Blevins, played by Charles Cioffi. George Avalos and Michael Liedtke from the Contra Costa Times reacted positive towards James Pickens, Jr.'s performance in the eighth season's \\"Via Negativa\\", saying the story \\"clicked\\" thanks to Kersh and Walter Skinner. Salon writer Aaron Kinner when writing a review for the ninth season, noted that he was the first black character since X's death in season four, while not positive towards the character's development during the ninth season and the season overall. Writing for Cinefantastique about the character's introduction, Paul Vitaris called Pickens \\"a fine addition to the cast\\" of the series, describing his portrayal of Kersh as \\"a strong presence\\". However, during a review of the eighth season two years later, Vitaris described Kersh as \\"one of the most one-note characters yet\\" on the series. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, describe Kersh's return in the eighth season as \\"contrived but forgivable\\".Shearman and Pearson, p. 229 Shearman and Pearson noted that the character is \\"an effective obstruction to any number of X-Files cases, but he can hardly be considered a lead villain\\".Shearman and Pearson, p. 260 In 1999, Pickens was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series for his work as Kersh, alongside Gillian Anderson, William B. Davis, David Duchovny, Mitch Pileggi and Chris Owens.

Regulations had to be laid before Parliament as soon as they were issued and could not be used to 'make it an offence for any person or persons to take part in a strike, or peacefully to persuade any other person or persons to take part in a strike' or take away trials. The maximum punishment for breaking a regulation would be prison 'with or without hard labour, for a term of three months, or a fine of one hundred pounds, or both such imprisonment and fine, together with the forfeiture of any goods or money in respect of which the offence has been committed'. Regulations could also be revised or added to. The Act was amended by the Emergency Powers (Amendment) Act (Northern Ireland) 1964. On 19 May 1974 Merlyn Rees, the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, signed a proclamation of a State of Emergency in the region under the amended Act, following the outbreak of the Ulster Workers' Council strike which eventually led to the collapse of the Sunningdale Agreement. The Act was repealed by the Civil Contingencies Act 2004.

It was republished in 2002 by HarperPerennial with a new introduction. The basic premise of The Beauty Myth is that as the social power and prominence of women have increased, the pressure they feel to adhere to unrealistic social standards of physical beauty has also grown stronger because of commercial influences on the mass media. This pressure leads to unhealthy behaviors by women and a preoccupation with appearance in both sexes, and it compromises the ability of women to be effective in and accepted by society. Summary In her introduction, Wolf offers the following analysis: Wolf also posits the idea of an iron maiden, an intrinsically unattainable standard that is then used to punish women physically and psychologically for their failure to achieve and conform to it. Wolf criticizes the fashion and beauty industries as exploitative of women, but claims the beauty myth extends into all areas of human functioning. Wolf writes that women should have \\"the choice to do whatever we want with our faces and bodies without being punished by an ideology that is using attitudes, economic pressure, and even legal judgments regarding women's appearance to undermine us psychologically and politically\\". Wolf argued that women were under assault by the \\"beauty myth\\" in five areas: work, religion, sex, violence, and hunger. Ultimately, Wolf argues for a relaxation of normative standards of beauty.The Beauty Myth, pp. 17-18, 20, 86, 131, 179, 218. Impact Wolf's book was a quick bestseller, garnering intensely polarized responses from the public and mainstream media, but winning praise from many feminists. Second-wave feminist Germaine Greer wrote that The Beauty Myth was \\"the most important feminist publication since The Female Eunuch\\", and Gloria Steinem wrote, \\"The Beauty Myth is a smart, angry, insightful book, and a clarion call to freedom. Every woman should read it.\\" British novelist Fay Weldon called the book \\"essential reading for the New Woman\\",Kim Hubbard, The Tyranny of Beauty, To Naomi Wolf, Pressure to Look Good Equals Oppression, People, June 24, 1991. and Betty Friedan wrote in Allure magazine that \\"The Beauty Myth and the controversy it is eliciting could be a hopeful sign of a new surge of feminist consciousness.\\" With the publication of The Beauty Myth, Wolf became a leading spokesperson of what was later described as the third wave of the feminist movement. Criticism In Who Stole Feminism? (1994) Christina Hoff Sommers criticized Wolf for publishing the claim that 150,000 women were dying every year from anorexia in the United States, writing that the actual figure was more likely to be somewhere between 100 and 400 per year. Similarly, a 2004 paper compared Wolf's eating disorder statistics to statistics from peer-reviewed epidemiological studies and concluded that 'on average, an anorexia statistic in any edition of The Beauty Myth should be divided by eight to get near the real statistic.' Schoemaker calculated that there are about 525 annual deaths from anorexia, 286 times less than Wolf's statistic. Humanities scholar Camille Paglia also criticized the book, arguing that Wolf's historical research and analysis was flawed.\\"If you want to see what‚Äôs wrong with Ivy League education, look at The Beauty Myth. Paglia, Camille (1992). Sex, Art, Culture: New Essays. New York: Vintage, Connection to women's studies Within women's studies, scholars posit that the Beauty Myth is a powerful force that keeps women focused on and distracted by body image and that provides both men and women with a way to judge and limit women due to their physical appearance. Magazines, posters, television ads and social media sites are, in this hypothesis, among the many platforms today that perpetuate beauty standards for both men and women. The daily presence and circulation of these platforms, it is argued, makes escaping these ideals almost impossible. Women and men alike are faced with ideal bodies, bodies that are marketed as attainable through diets and gym memberships. However, for most people these beauty standards are neither healthy nor achievable through diet or exercise. Women often place a greater importance on weight loss than on maintaining a healthy average weight, and they commonly make great financial and physical sacrifices to reach these goals. Yet failing to embody these ideals makes women targets of criticism and societal scrutiny. Perfectionistic, unattainable goals are cited as an explanation for the increasing rates of plastic surgery and anorexia nervosa. Anorexia is one of the most prevalent eating disorders in Western countries \\"affecting an estimated 2.5 million people in the United States alone.\\" Of this number, more than 90 percent of anorexics are girls and young women. They suffer from a \\"serious mental health disease that involves compulsive dieting and drastic weight loss\\". This weight loss is the result of deliberate self-starvation to achieve a thinner appearance, and it is frequently associated with the disorder bulimia. Anorexia's deep psychological roots make it difficult to treat and often extend the recovery process into a life-long journey. Some feminists believe the beauty myth is part of a system that reinforces male dominance. According to Naomi Wolf, as women increasingly focus their attention on their physical appearance, their focus on equal rights and treatment takes a lower priority. The same is argued in Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex, in which she recounts the effects of societies that condition adolescent girls and young women to behave in feminine ways. According to Beauvoir, these changes encompass a \\"huge array of social expectations including physical appearance, but unlike the social expectations on boys, the social expectations on girls and women usually inhibit them from acting freely\\". In her argument, Beauvoir cites things such as clothing, make-up, diction and manners as subjects of scrutiny that women face but men do not. Studies reveal that women today strive to achieve aesthetic ideals because they recognize the correlation between beauty and social standing. According to Dr. Vivian Diller's book Face It: What Women Really Feel as their Looks Change and What to Do About It, \\"most women agree, reporting the good looks continue to be associated with respect, legitimacy, and power in their relationships\\". In the commercial world, hiring, evaluations and promotions based on physical appearance push women to place the importance of beauty above that of their work and skills. Over the course of history, beauty ideals for women have changed drastically to represent societal views. Women with fair skin were idealized and segregated and used to justify the unfair treatment of dark-skinned women. In the early 1900s, the ideal female body was represented by a pale complexion and cinched-waist; freckles, sun spots, and/or skin imperfections led to scrutiny by others. In 1920, women with a thinner frame and small bust were seen as beautiful, while the ideal body type of full-chested, hourglass figures began in the early 1950s, leading to a spike in plastic surgery and eating disorders. Society is continually shifting the socially constructed ideals of beauty imposed on women.

He was a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary from 1964 to 1982. Early life and career Born in Jalandhar, India, Richard Wilberforce was the son of Samuel Wilberforce, ICS, later a judge of the Lahore High Court, and of Katherine Wilberforce, the daughter of John Sheepshanks, Bishop of Norwich. His great-grandfather was Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Winchester, and his great-great-grandfather was the abolitionist William Wilberforce, a connection which had much influence upon him. Wilberforce spent the first seven years of his life in India, before being sent to England in 1914 on the outbreak of the First World War. He attended five preparatory schools, the last being Sandroyd School. From Sandroyd he went to Winchester College in 1920 where Monty Rendall, the headmaster, convinced him to drop Mathematics, in which he excelled, in favour of Classics, in order to broaden his career options. Wilberforce excelled in his new subject, winning all four top college prizes. From Winchester Wilberforce entered New College, Oxford, where he was a scholar, obtaining firsts in both Classical Moderations (1928) and Literae humaniores (1930). He won the Craven, Hertford, and Ireland scholarships in Classics, as well as the Eldon Law Scholarship. In 1932, on his third attempt, Wilberforce was elected a prize fellow of All Souls College: the two other successful candidates that year were Isaiah Berlin and Patrick Reilly. Wilberforce remained a fellow of the college until his death seventy years later. Moving to London, Wilberforce was called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1932. He was the pupil of the renowned Chancery junior Wilfred Hunt; a fellow pupil was H. L. A. Hart. Wilberforce joined the chambers of Andrew Clark (today called Wilberforce Chambers) and practised at the Chancery bar but, lacking family connections, his earnings were meagre, although they began to increase toward the end of the decade. = Wartime service = Fearing that war was inevitable, Wilberforce joined the Army reserves after Munich in 1938. At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 Wilberforce volunteered for service in the British Army, though he was advised against it, and was commissioned into the Royal Artillery. In 1940 he was aide-de-camp to Major-General Bernard Paget, who led the British expeditionary force during the Norwegian Campaign. After Norway, Wilberforce held various staff appointments, before being posted to the War Office where, as a lieutenant colonel, he was put in charge of Army entertainments. In 1944 he was attached to the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force. In 1945, he drafted the German Instrument of Surrender which Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel and others signed in Berlin on 8 May. After the German surrender Wilberforce, by then a brigadier, headed the British legal section of the Allied Control Council. In 1946‚Äì7 he returned to London to serve as Under- Secretary at the Control Office for Germany and Austria. For his wartime service, Wilberforce was appointed an OBE and received the American Bronze Star. He retained the rank of honorary brigadier. While in Berlin, Wilberforce met Yvette Marie Lenoan, a captain in the French Army and the daughter of Roger Lenoan, a judge of the Cour de Cassation posted to Berlin: they married in 1947. = Return to the bar = Wilberforce returned to the bar in 1947 when the Control Office for Germany and Austria was abolished. His old set of chambers had disappeared, forcing him to find new accommodation. His practice was at first very small, and he considered leaving the bar. He acted for Prince Ernest Augustus of Hanover to be recognized as a British subject under the Sophia Naturalization Act 1705. He became a member of the Bar Council in 1951 and was appointed a Queen's Counsel in 1954. He participated in several Foreign Office cases, including Corfu Channel case and the Nowegian Fisheries case in the International Court of Justice. He was also appointed as the British legal member of the International Civil Aviation Organization. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George for services in relation to the Warsaw Convention in 1956. In the 1950 election, he stood for Kingston upon Hull Central as the Conservative candidate, in the city formerly represented by his ancestor William Wilberforce, but lost to the incumbent Labour MP Mark Hewitson.  Judicial career  Wilberforce was appointed to the High Court in 1961 and assigned to the Chancery Division, receiving the customary knighthood. On 1 October 1964, after only three years' service, he was elevated to the House of Lords as a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, and was made a life peer as Baron Wilberforce, of the City and County of Kingston- upon-Hull; he was also sworn of the Privy Council. He is the only English judge in recent times to have been appointed to the House of Lords straight from the High Court, without first serving in the Court of Appeal. Wilberforce served as a law lord for 18 years, during which he heard 465 appeals, often giving the leading judgment. He was the Senior Law Lord from 1975 to his retirement in 1982. His decisions were highly regarded and covered large areas of the law. He was president of the Anti-Slavery Society from 1971. In the early 1970s he chaired two inquiries. The first was into power workers' pay in 1971, and found in the workers' favour. The second was set up during the miners' strike of 1972; thanks to Wiberforce's high work rate, it reported within a week, and recommended pay increases of between ¬£4.50 and ¬£6 to miners. Wilberforce was Chancellor of the University of Hull between 1978 and 1994, High Steward of the University of Oxford from 1967 to 1990, Visitor of Wolfson College from 1974 to 1990 and Visitor of Linacre College from 1983 to 1990.

Since 1975 California State Parks has administered and maintained the mine as a historic site. The Empire Mine is \\"one of the oldest, largest, deepest, longest and richest gold mines in California\\". Between 1850 and its closure in 1956, the Empire Mine produced 5.8 million ounces of gold, extracted from of underground passages. History In October 1850, George Roberts discovered gold in a quartz outcrop on Ophir Hill, but sold the claim in 1851 to Woodbury, Parks and Co. for $350 (or about $ today, adjusted for inflation). The Woodbury Company consolidated several local claims into the Ophir Hill Mine, but they mismanaged their finances and in 1852 were forced to sell the business at auction. It was purchased by John P. Rush and the Empire Quartz Hill Co. The Empire Mining Co. was incorporated in 1854, after John Rush was bought out.Johnston, W.D., 1940, The Gold Quartz Veins of Grass Valley, California, USGS Professional Paper 194, Washington:US Government Printing Office As word spread that hard rock gold had been found in California, miners from the tin and copper mines of Cornwall, England, arrived to share their experience and expertise in hard rock mining. Particularly important was the Cornish contribution of the Cornish engine, operated on steam, which emptied the depths of the mine of its constant water seepage at a rate of per day. This enabled increased productivity and expansion underground. Starting in 1895, Lester Allan Pelton's water wheel provided electric power for the mine and stamp mill. The Cornish provided the bulk of the labor force from the late 1870s until the mine's closure eighty years later. William Bowers Bourn acquired control of the company in 1869. Bourn died in 1874, and his estate ran the mine, abandoning the Ophir vein for the Rich Hill in 1878. Bourn's son, William Bowers Bourn II, formed the Original Empire Co. in 1878, took over the assets of the Empire Mining Co., and continued work on the Ophir vein after it was bottomed out at and allowed to fill with water. With his financial backing, and after 1887, the mining knowledge and management of his younger cousin George W. Starr, the Empire Mine became famous for its mining technology. Bourn purchased the North Star Mine in 1884, turning it into a major producer, and then sold it to James D. Hague in 1887, along with controlling interest in the Empire a year later. Bourn reacquired control of the Empire Mine in 1896, forming the Empire Mines and Investment Co. In 1897, he commissioned Willis Polk to design the \\"Cottage\\", using waste rock from the mine. The \\"Cottage\\" included a greenhouse, gardens, fountains and a reflecting pool. Between 1898 and 1905, a clubhouse with tennis courts, bowling alley and squash courts were built nearby. The Empire Mine installed a cyanide plant in 1910, which was an easier gold recovery process than chlorination. In 1915, Bourn acquired the Pennsylvania Mining Co., and the Work Your Own Diggings Co., neighboring mines, which gave the Empire Mines and Investment Co. access to the Pennsylvania vein. The North Star also had some rights to that vein, but both companies compromised and made an adjustment. In 1928, at the recommendation of Fred Searls of Nevada City, Newmont Mining Corp. purchased the Empire Mine from Bourn. Newmont also purchased the North Star Mine, resulting in Empire-Star Mines, Ltd. The business was managed by Fred Nobs and later by Jack Mann. Gold mines were defined as \\"nonessential industry to the war effort\\" by the War Production Board of the US Government on 8 October 1942, which shut down operations until 30 June 1945. After the war, a shortage of skilled miners forced the suspension of operations below the 4,600-foot level by 1951. By the 1950s inflation costs for gold mining were leaving the operation unprofitable. In 1956 a crippling miners' strike over falling wages ended operations. Ellsworth Bennett, a 1910 graduate of the Mackay School of Mines in Reno was the last \\"Cap'n\\" (Superintendent) of the Empire, and the only person from management allowed across the picket line (the miners' lives depended on his engineering skills and they worked as a team). Bennett oversaw the closing of the Empire on May 28, 1957 when the last Cornish water pumps were shut and removed. In its final year of operation in 1956, the Empire Mine had reached an incline depth of . In 1974 California State Parks purchased the Empire Mine surface property for $1.25 million ($ million today), to create a state historic park. The state park now contains , including forested backcountry. Newmont Mining retained the mineral rights to the Empire Mine, and 47 acres, if they decide to reopen the Empire Star Mines. Geology Grass Valley geologic map showing the underlying granodiorite Grass Valley geologic cross section showing the Empire vein A Granodiorite body long, north to south, and up to wide, underlies the district. This body intruded into surrounding metamorphic rocks. Gold ore deposits reside in the quartz veins, ranging from 3 to 7 ounces per ton. The Empire Vein outcrops to the east on a north-south strike, dipping at a 35-degree angle to the west. The vein was mined with inclined shafts following dip, with horizontal shafts (drifts) every along strike. The ore was mined by stoping.McQuiston, F.W., 1986, Gold: The Saga of the Empire Mine, 1850-1956, Grass Valley:Empire Mine Park Association, Clark, W.B., 1963, Gold Districts of California, Bulletin 193, Sacramento: California Division of Mines and Geology Museum Empire Cottage was built using waste rock from the mine. On weekends from May through October, volunteers dressed in Edwardian clothing give living history tours of the Bourn Cottage, the 1890s country estate home of William Bourn, Jr., and the Mineyard, with demonstrations of mine operations. The park's museum contains a scale model of the underground workings of the Empire/Star mine complex, exhibits of ore samples from local mines, a recreated Assay Office and a collection of minerals. There are of gardens to tour. The Empire Mine Park Association (EMPA) provides of the interpretive and educational goals of this state historic park through donations, visitor center sales, membership dues and special events.

It deals with two American friends imprisoned in Thailand for alleged drug smuggling. Its title is taken from a Grateful Dead song written by Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter from their 1970 album American Beauty. Plot Lifelong best friends Alice Marano and Darlene Davis take a trip after graduating from high school, giving their parents the impression that they're going to Hawaii. However, Alice talks Darlene into going to Thailand instead, after comparing the prices of both destinations. Darlene agrees, albeit with some reluctance. Once in Thailand, they meet a captivating Australian man who calls himself Nick Parks. Unknown to them, Nick Parks is a drug smuggler. Darlene is particularly smitten with Nick and convinces Alice to take Nick up on his offer to treat the two of them to what amounts to a day trip to Hong Kong. While boarding their flight at Don Mueang International Airport, the girls are seized by the police. Alice and Darlene are shocked to discover that one of their bags contains heroin, which had been planted by Nick. The two girls are interrogated by the Thai police and Darlene signs a confession written in Thai, which she foolishly thinks is her verbatim statement. At their trial, they beg for mercy and are given a lenient 33-year sentence instead of the usual life sentence in prison. In prison, the girls are advised to seek out Henry Greene, aka \\"Yankee Hank\\", an expatriate American attorney living in Thailand. As the girls try to deal with the violence and squalor of prison, Hank begins work on their case. He tracks down another girl who had been used as an unwitting drug mule by Nick Parks, but is warned that the smuggler has friends in high places. Hank arranges a deal with a corrupt prosecutor whereby the girls will receive clemency if they \\"confess\\" to lying about Parks' involvement and take full blame. The girls agree, but the prosecutor double crosses them on the deal. Realizing that Darlene will not survive their time in prison, Alice begs the King of Thailand to allow her to serve both sentences in exchange for letting Darlene go. The deal is accepted and Darlene is released. She promises to continue working with Henry to try to free Alice.

Reception Brokedown Palace received negative reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes rated the film \\"Rotten\\", with only 31% of 35 critics giving positive reviews, summarizing that the movie \\"lacks credibility and tension\\". Roger Ebert however gave the film three out of four stars, saying \\"The heart of the film is in the performances of Danes and Beckinsale\\". The film underperformed at the box office, failing to make back even half of its $25 million budget.

It was a show which explored the history of Japan over the course of 19 minutes, focusing specifically on the history of Japan's engagement with the outside world. The show featured an animated crane explaining Japanese history to a young boy and girl from Yokohama. The show featured dialogue between a number of audio-animatronic figures (including Sakamoto Ry≈çma, It≈ç Hirobumi and Fukuzawa Yukichi) and a movie screen in the background. Park guides and maps said \\"explore Japan's heritage in an incredible time-travel adventure!\\" The show was presented in a rotating theater, similar to the Carousel of Progress at Walt Disney World and previously at Disneyland. However, they were designed in the opposite way. In Tokyo, the audiences sat in the rotating theater inside with the stages built around them, whereas, in the Carousel of Progress the audience sits in the rotating outside with the stages being the center of the building. Meet the World's layout meant less audience capacity but a larger stage area, while Carousel of Progress's format has more capacity but smaller stages. The \\"Meet The World\\" song was written by the Sherman Brothers. The attraction was designed by WED Enterprises Imagineer Claude Coats. The Animatronics and Show Action Equipment were built at Walt Disney World's Central Shops in Florida (adjacent to the huge carriages for Epcot's American Adventure attraction being built at the same time.) The show scenes were staged at the WED facility in North Hollywood for integration and show programming. The attraction had over thirty Audio Animatronic figures, nine 70 millimeter projectors and 15 large pieces of show action equipment. There were two large Stewart rear projection screens and three proscenium filling perforated \\"scrim/screens.\\" The figures were sculpted by Blaine Gibson with the exception of the three Meiji figures who were sculpted in Glendale by a Japanese sculptor from Toho Studios in Tokyo. Plot The show opened with two young children from Yokohama discussing the ancient creation of Japan. Soon, an anthropomorphic crane appeared to tell them the whole story. She took them back through time to uncover the ancient J≈çmon people and the difficult relationship they encountered with the sea and land. But it changed in the next era when Prince Sh≈çtoku devoted his efforts to 'meet the world' and created a constitution, explored Chinese culture and brought Buddhism, arts and writing systems to Japan. The crane then took them forward through time. They arrived at Tanegashima where Portuguese traders met with locals, introducing Japan to new trade opportunities as well as the outside world. Additionally, firearms and Christianity were introduced during this period. However, because of these elements, the Sakoku policy of self-exile was enacted, leaving the country in isolation, apart from limited trade with the Dutch and Chinese at Nagasaki. Only when US Navy Commodore Matthew C. Perry arrived with his Black Ships did the exile end and Japan 'meet the world' again. The shogun retired and signaled the time of the Meiji Restoration. However, the ruling power took the idea of 'meet the world' from a peaceful one to a destructive and aggressive one. As a result, Japan soon entered \\"dark days\\", but the crane reassured the two children that those days have ended and that Japan now led the way of today. The young boy asked the crane if she was the \\"Spirit of Japan\\", but she responded that he and all the other people were the \\"Spirit of Japan\\". A final montage of Japan's modern accomplishments brought the show to a close as the children and the crane soared to the skies on a hot-air balloon. Planned Version at Epcot Many attractions, including Meet the World, were originally planned as part of the Japan (Epcot) Pavilion in World Showcase at Epcot in Orlando, Florida. Unlike the other attractions that did not make it past the planning stages, Meet the World's show building was constructed with the theater to be on the second floor. However, due to miscalculations made in the building's design, the rotating theater put a lot of stress on the support beams. In order for the attraction to be able to function safely, the show building would have to have major rework done. As Epcot's construction was behind schedule, it was decided to move forward without the attraction. Today, the current space is used for rehearsals and storage. History Konosuke Matsushita, founder of the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, had a strong interest in Japanese history and in Walt Disney's visions and pressed Disney to create a Japanese analog of the American \\"Hall of Presidents\\" attraction. Among other issues, certain politically sensitive issues such as World War II were noticeably under- emphasized in the show. The show mentions that there were some \\"dark days\\" between the Meiji Restoration and the \\"Japan of today\\", which left Disney management feeling nervous about possible reactions from guests (specifically American veterans and other groups) over such a dramatic conflict in history being 'glossed over' as 'dark days', despite other attractions in the Disney canon having unbiased references to the same time period. Concept art and models were featured in the 1982 book \\"Walt Disney's EPCOT Center\\", along with a proposed Africa pavilion. The English soundtrack of the ride had surfaced on a tribute video, where it was edited with footage from the version seen in Tokyo Disneyland. The attraction opened at Tokyo Disneyland as one of that park's initial attractions on April 15, 1983, and closed on June 30, 2002. Matsushita Electric was its initial sponsor and subsidized the attraction so that it was one of the few free attractions while the park still used ride tickets. Konosuke Matsushita died in 1989 and Matsushita shifted its corporate sponsorship to the nearby Star Tours attraction around that time; Japan Airlines then took over sponsorship of Meet the World for a short period. In summer 2006, Meet the World's show building was demolished to make way for Monsters, Inc. Ride & Go Seek. Meet the World was one of the few attractions in the park that dealt with Japan; the other was a film, \\"The Eternal Sea\\", found in the future Magic-Eye Theater. The Oriental Land Company, the owners of Tokyo Disneyland, specifically wanted their park to focus on the American way of life and the American parks of Disneyland and Walt Disney World.

It is owned by Gois Broadcasting. It broadcasts in Spanish, and plays bachata, merengue, salsa and pop music. WLS in Chicago is the dominant (class A) station on 890 AM; WAMG must reduce power during the nighttime hours and uses a directional antenna to protect the nighttime skywave signal of WLS. WAMG also simulcasts its programming on WLLH (1400 AM) in Lowell and Lawrence to reach the area north of Boston and the southern part of New Hampshire. It also operates translator W235CS (94.9 FM) in Dedham.  History  WAMG first came on the air in 1994 as WBMA, initially airing a Spanish-language religious format that gradually migrated from WBIV (now WQOM). In 1995, the station adopted a sports format, affiliated with the Prime Sports network. The station also adopted the call letters of WBPS at this time, which remained with the station for many years, even after the station dropped sports for brokered ethnic programs in 1996. In 1998, WBPS was acquired by Mega Communications, and on December 1, the station adopted a Spanish adult contemporary format, initially as \\"Estrella 890\\" before becoming \\"Amor 890\\".http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1998/RR-1998-12-04.pdf After the failure of a Spanish-language all-news format on WNNY (now WKDM) in New York City, Mega began to broker many of the company's stations. Consequently, on December 1, 2001, Mega began leasing WBPS to CNET, at which time the station adopted the technology news/talk format of \\"CNET Radio,\\" as a simulcast of KNEW. After CNET's programming left WBPS in 2002, Mega began leasing the station to Chicago-based Air Time Media. This group launched a conservative news/talk format on WBPS, which was known as the \\"Boston Talk Party\\". In 2003, Mega sold the company's other Boston station, WAMG (\\"Mega 1150\\"), to Salem Communications. In order to retain the successful Spanish-language tropical format of WAMG, Mega moved the format and call letters to the 890 frequency, canceling Air Time's lease on the station. Some of the hosts which were dropped from WBPS landed on 1150, which Salem re-launched as conservative talk station WTTT (that station is now WWDJ). Additionally, when WAMG relocated to 890 as \\"Mega 890\\", the frequency inherited the format's simulcast on WLLH, which was not included in 1150's sale to Salem. Logo as \\"890 ESPN\\", used from July 2005 until September 14, 2009 In 2005, Mega Communications announced the sale of WAMG and WLLH to WallerSutton 2000, an investment firm, in cooperation with locally owned \\"J Sports\\". Upon closure of the sale, WAMG dropped the Spanish tropical format and reverted to a sports format, this time affiliated with ESPN Radio. The station also added a local afternoon show featuring Michael Felger, and used the branding of \\"ESPN Boston\\". (The last broadcast of The Mike Felger Show was on July 10, 2008.) Other local programs heard on the station included Salk & Halloran, Lew & Mike, Celtic Pride and The New England Hockey Journal. The station was also the home of Northeastern University football and men's hockey. Through its ESPN Radio affiliation, WAMG also served as the Boston outlet for Mike and Mike in the Morning, The Herd with Colin Cowherd, The Scott Van Pelt Show, The Doug Gottlieb Show, and All Night with Jason Smith, as well as ESPN Radio's play-by-play broadcasts, such as Bowl Championship Series, the World Series, and the National Invitation Tournament. On August 3, 2006, WAMG was the first to report that veteran major league catcher Javy L√≥pez was being traded from the Baltimore Orioles to the Boston Red Sox. The trade was designed to fill a hole caused by the recent injury to Jason Varitek. The next day, the trade was announced as official; the Orioles received cash and a player to be named later (Adam Stern) in return. WAMG's logo prior to adding the 94.9 translator WAMG discontinued ESPN Radio programming on September 14, 2009; the transmitter was shut off at 5:00 p.m. Gois returned the station to the air on December 3, 2009, reverting it again to Spanish-language programming with the current format, branded \\"La Nueva Mega\\"; simulcast partner WLLH had returned to the air with this format in late October. Initially operating the station under a local marketing agreement, Gois purchased WAMG outright in January 2010.

The station is owned by Holy Family Communications and is licensed to Natick, Massachusetts.  History  The station first began operation November 12, 1972 as WGTR, owned by John Garabedian. It was a full service daytime station for Natick and MetroWest, programming top-40 music. WGTR originally from a small tower in a residential area of Natick. However, Garabedian had long hoped to expand WGTR into Boston itself. In 1980, he won a construction permit to move to a five-tower setup in Ashland, operating at 25,000 watts during the day. This gave it adequate coverage of most of the Boston area. Plans called for WGTR to power down to 2,500 watts at night to protect KYW in Philadelphia and WBZ in Boston; the latter station operated at adjacent 1030 AM. Unfortunately for Garabedian, Westinghouse Broadcasting, owner of both KYW and WBZ, complained that the Ashland site wouldn't provide enough protection for those stations. As a result, WGTR was only allowed to operate at 1,700 watts at night. Meanwhile, as Garabedian turned his focus to FM radio station WGTF on Nantucket (now WEII) and, later, music video station WVJV-TV channel 66 in nearby Marlborough (now WUNI), 1060 would go through several formats: all-news,(dead link) the Stardust adult-standards service (as WSTD), and talk (as WTTP). The station was sold to Satellite Radio Network in 1987, becoming WBIV, a Spanish language religious station. WBIV swapped ownership with the permit for WBMA in Dedham, Massachusetts in 1994, eventually moving its programming to WBMA's facility on 890 AM (now WAMG) later that year. As WBMA at that time refused to allow WBIV's new owner, Family Radio, to remain at the Ashland site, 1060 would thus leave the air November 3, 1994, following a transitional period in which WBMA operated in the daylight hours and WBIV at night. Alex Langer bought the WBIV license in 1995, and leased it to Great Commission Broadcasting, who returned it to the air February 6, 1997 as WJLT, a 1,000-watt daytime-only religious station operating from WKOX (now WXKS)'s tower in Framingham. In 1999, Langer changed the call letters to WMEX, and the station announced a format swap with what had been WRPT (now WSRO), once again adopting a talk format. This took effect on-air January 24, 2000, accompanied by a power boost to 40,000 watts from Framingham. The station's second logo as WBIX, used from 2003 until 2010. In 2001, Langer leased the station to asset manager Brad Bleidt, who changed the calls to WBIX and implemented a business talk format. Bleidt bought the station outright in 2003 for $13.8 millionLane, Bill. Chris Egan to buy business radio station WBIX. Boston Business Journal, 2004-06-07. and poured most of his efforts into making WBIX a 24-hour operation once again. In 2004, WBIX began nighttime operations from its old site in Ashland, operating at 2,500 watts. However, soon after a party celebrating the launch of nighttime operations, Bleidt sent a taped confession to the Securities and Exchange Commission admitting that he'd turned his asset management firm into a massive Ponzi scheme. He admitted to bilking his clients out of \\"tens of millions of dollars\\" since 1984. He also admitted to using part of the stolen money to buy WBIX. The scam would have lasted longer had a Greek Orthodox church not asked for the $1.5 million it had invested with him.Jewell, Mark. Entrepreneur's unexpected confession leaves victims shocked, mad. Associated Press via Boston Globe, 2004-11-28. Bleidt ultimately pleaded guilty to mail fraud and money laundering and was sentenced to 11 years in prison.Borrus, Amy. An Affinity for Fraud. Business Week, 2006-03-23. Bleidt had planned to sell the station to real estate investor Chris Egan in 2004. However, after Bleidt's confession and arrest, all of his assets, including WBIX, were placed into receivership. The receiver asked Langer to take over day-to-day operations again. Langer bought the station outright in 2006. Holy Family Communications announced its acquisition of the station on July 12, 2010, with plans to implement Catholic programming.North East Radio Watch July 12, 2010 After the sale's completion on September 15, 2010, WBIX went silent. The call letters were changed to WQOM on September 20; on November 1, it went on air shortly before 8:00 a.m. with inspirational music followed by a Mass conducted by Cardinal Sean O'Malley. He welcomed the new station to the air. (The station briefly tested on September 16, with programming including a recitation of the Rosary and Catholic talk shows.) Holy Family did not acquire the lease of the Framingham transmitter and studios from Alex Langer (as he continues to operate WSRO from that location); as a result, the station began broadcasting full-time from Ashland for the first time in 15 years and increased its daytime power to 50,000 watts.

Shepard had also established WEAN in Providence, Rhode Island a month earlier, on June 2, 1922. The station was initially promoted after signing on as the \\"Shepard Radio Station\\";\\"Sermon at Cathedral to Be Broadcast by Radio.\\" Boston Globe, August 26, 1922, p. 3. it was not until September that the call letters \\"WNAC\\" came into use.Programs for Today.\\" Boston Globe, September 15, 1922, p. 17. WNAC moved around the dial in its early days and settled on 1230 kilocycles a few years later. On January 4, 1923, using a 100-foot antenna connected by a clothesline to the building's roof, WNAC arranged the first network broadcast in radio history with station WEAF in New York City. Shepard launched a sister station to WNAC, WNAB, on May 13, 1925.\\"WNAC Has Sister Station in WNAB.\\" Boston Herald, May 20, 1925, p. 27. WNAB became WASN (Air Shopping News) on February 1, 1927, an early experiment with home shopping by radio, in which updates from 15 department stores in Greater Boston aired in regular intervals alongside pre-recorded and live orchestra music.\\"New Station Will Take Air Tomorrow.\\" Boston Herald, January 30, 1927, p. 6A. WASN was also notable in that all of the staff announcers and the program director were females; while the experiment was short-lived due to technical issues, the majority of the station's female staff enjoyed continued employment at WNAC. By July 5, the station became WBIS (Boston Information Service), maintaining some of the shopping programming but mixed with \\"helpful information and advice\\" in addition to pre-recorded music; the station operated with limited hours, from 8-10 a.m. and 2-4 p.m. on weekdays.\\"Radio Broadcast.\\" Boston Herald, July 15, 1927, p. 11.\\"Claire Crawford, Luminary of WBIS.\\" Boston Herald, December 9, 1928, p.

In 1927, WNAC became one of the sixteen charter members of the CBS Radio Network, it remained a CBS network affiliate for the next decade.Radio Digest, September 1927, quoted in: McLeod, Elizabeth (September 20, 2002).

In 1929, WNAC moved to new studios inside the Hotel Buckminster, with the entrance on the Brookline Avenue side (21 Brookline Avenue), that location served as the station's home for the next four decades.\\"Plan Larger Studios for WNAC.\\" Boston Globe, January 26, 1930, p. A16. Between February 1929 and July 1930, Shepard also launched The Yankee Network, with WNAC as its flagship; it was a regional network serving radio stations throughout New England and was a pioneer in radio news coverage.\\"Yankee Network is Being Formed.\\" New York Times, February 9, 1930, p. X20.\\"Yankee Network Becomes a Reality.\\" Boston Globe, July 13, 1930, p. 51.

Sullivan. \\"Yankee Network Soon to be Dissolved.\\" Boston Herald, January 31, 1967, p. 35. In 1931, Shepard purchased a second Boston station, WAAB, which became an affiliate of the Mutual Radio Network in 1935, a year after MBS was formed. He also launched a second regional network, \\"The Colonial Network\\", with WAAB as its flagship station.\\"What We Hear.\\" Boston Globe, August 9, 1936, p. D6. Outside of Boston, Yankee and Colonial programming were usually heard on the same station. Additionally, Colonial carried Mutual programming to its affiliates. Between them, Yankee and Colonial carried home games of the Boston Red Sox and Boston Braves baseball teams as well as the Boston Bruins hockey team. The year 1935 also saw the hiring of Fred B. Cole, a young announcer who would spend more than 50 years on the air, most of them in Boston at various stations. Cole left WNAC for network radio, and returned to Boston at WHDH (850 AM) in 1946. In 1937, WNAC became an NBC Red Network affiliate after losing CBS to WEEI (590 AM). Four years later, WNAC's frequency changed to 1260 kilocycles. In 1942, to comply with anti-duopoly regulations established by the Federal Communications Commission, WAAB was moved to Worcester, about 40 miles west of Boston.\\"WAAB On the Air from Worcester.\\" Broadcasting, December 14, 1942, p. 10. At the same time, WNAC lost NBC Red Network affiliation to WBZ. With WAAB having been moved out of Boston, WNAC took over the Mutual affiliation. The Colonial Network was also shut down, with Yankee picking up many of its programs; in other parts of New England, however, the only change for some former Colonial programming was in the time periods of these shows.\\"John Shepard 3rd.\\" Broadcasting, June 19, 1950, p. 23. In December 1942, the Winter Street Corp., the holding company for Shepard family interests‚Äîincluding WNAC and the Yankee Network‚Äîannounced it would be sold to The General Tire & Rubber Company for $1.24 million.\\"Yankee Network is Sold to General Tire Company.\\" Christian Science Monitor, December 16, 1942, p. 3. Winter Street was controlled by trusts set up for two of the children of founder John Shepard Jr.: John Shepard III (general manager of WNAC and Yankee); and Robert Shepard, who managed the family's remaining department store in Providence; the transactions, and the closing of the Shepard Stores location in Boston in 1937, were viewed as a strategy to convert the elder Shepard's assets to cash.\\"Boston Shepard Store Closes After 72 Years of Service.\\" Boston Post, December 26, 1937, p. 9. John Shepard III remained with the station as general manager under a five-year contract.Two Major N.E. Networks Sold to Rubber Co.\\" Boston Herald, December 17, 1942, p. 6. The son of General Tire president William F. O'Neil, William M. O'Neil, Jr., had already owned and operated WJW (850 AM) in Akron/Cleveland since 1940, but did so independently of his father and the manufacturer. Later that same month, the FCC approved the transaction after securing an affidavit from General Tire's president that \\"no better deal\\" would be offered the tire company to buy \\"time, facilities and services\\" on Yankee Network stations, and that General Tire would \\"never\\" use its ownership to gain an unfair advertising advantage over competitors. Some 40 years later, the company was forced to exit broadcasting for reasons including illegal reciprocal trade agreements. In addition to WNAC and the two networks, the sale included WEAN, WAAB, WICC in Bridgeport, Connecticut; and experimental FM stations in Paxton, Massachusetts and Mount Washington, New Hampshire. In 1947, the FCC denied a request to allow WNAC to move to 1200 kHz and boost its power, using a directional 50,000-watt transmitter. = WVDA = In May 1953, General Teleradio ‚Äì then the name for General Tire's broadcasting division ‚Äì bought WLAW and WLAW-FM, both licensed to Lawrence, Massachusetts, from Hildreth and Rogers for $475,000; and concurrently sold WNAC to Vic Diehm and Associates, Inc., for $125,000. (WLAW-FM's license would be surrendered, as WNAC-FM (98.5 FM) was retained by General Teleradio). While generally regarded as a transaction that saw WNAC \\"move\\" from 1260 AM to 680 AM, in reality, on June 17, 1953, General Teleradio changed WLAW's call letters to WNAC (680 AM), changed the format to WNAC's existing format, and reassigned on- and off-air personnel. Vic Diehm and Associates subsequently changed WNAC (1260 AM)'s calls to WVDA and launched a new format on the station utilizing the studios previously used by WLAW at the Hotel Bradford in Boston.\\"Modification of License.\\" Broadcasting Magazine, July 2, 1951, p. 81. Most of WVDA's programming was from the ABC Radio Network, with some local programming. Among them were a few DJ shows, and for a brief time in the mid-1950s, a 3-hour morning news block. = WEZE = The station was sold in 1957 to Great Trails Broadcasting Corp., owned by former Truman administration Commerce Secretary George Sawyer, for $252,000. It became WEZE, an NBC Radio Network affiliate. The station carried most NBC Radio programs, and some local DJ shows featuring softer music. On October 19, 1959, WEZE began a beautiful music format, branded as \\"The Wonderful World Of Music\\",WEZE Newspaper ad, Boston Globe, October 19, 1959 that targeted older listeners. The station programmed music in uninterrupted quarter-hour blocks during the daytime hours (half-hour blocks at night), and continued to serve as Boston's NBC Radio affiliate until 1966. It carried hourly newscasts, some feature programs, special news events, but very little of the network's Monitor weekend service. During the \\"Wonderful World Of Music\\" days, live announcers spoke only every fifteen minutes, to run down what had been played during the previous quarter- hour, read commercials, and give weather updates. In his autobiography, comedian George Carlin describes his experiences as a disc jockey at the station. He was fired after he took the station's news station wagon to New York to buy marijuana, leaving the station unable to cover a prison riot. Carlin wrote that another future comedian, Jack Burns, also worked there as an announcer and newscaster at the station during this time. Although only 5,000 watts, WEZE was one of Boston's top-rated radio stations for most of the 1960s. Then, the beautiful music format made a big splash on FM, diverting listeners from WEZE's AM signal. For many years, WEZE's studios were located on the ground floor of the Statler Office Building near Boston's Park Square, with a picture window on the corner of St. James and Columbus Avenues, allowing passers-by to see the announcer at work in the studio. In the fall of 1972, WEZE changed formats to a rock 'n roll oldies sound with live personality DJs. This was tweaked by mid-1973 by Program Director Steve Hunter and Consultant Kent Burkhardt to include current pop/rock hits as well. Known as \\"Z 1260\\", WEZE was then in direct competition with established top 40 AM stations WRKO (680 AM), WMEX (1510 AM), and WVBF (105.7 FM, now WROR-FM). Perhaps the best-known announcer during this period was Alan Colmes, who replaced Chuck Kelly in the morning drive slot and who later co-hosted a talk show with Sean Hannity on cable TV's Fox News Channel. In March 1974, WEZE's format was modified again to a more MOR/personality approach. From August 1975 until early 1977, WEZE tried \\"The Wonderful World Of Music\\" again (which was often branded \\"The Easiest Sound In Town\\" in newspaper ads, billboards, and television commercials).WEZE Newspaper Ad, September 1, 1975 Since FM radios still weren't widespread in automobiles, station management hoped that people who would listen to easy-listening FM stations like WJIB (96.9 FM, now WBQT) at home or work would listen to WEZE on their AM-only car radios while driving. The revival met with very little success, as the audience for \\"beautiful music\\" had largely moved to FM. In early 1977, WEZE became one of the first stations to program what might now be called adult album alternative. This format, promoted as \\"AlbuM 1260\\" (stylized to denote its frequency as \\"AM 1260\\"),WEZE promotion material given to potential advertisers, March, 1977 continued until the 1978 sale of the station to New England Continental Media. New England Continental Media, which shortly became the Salem Media Group, instituted a religious format. Initially, WEZE's religious programming consisted of contemporary Christian music, Christian features, teaching, and preaching; half of the station's schedule was devoted to music. While a religious station, the station continued to operate commercially. By the mid 1980s, local Christian talk shows replaced some of the hours of weekday music programming. In later years, more teaching programs were added to replace the remaining weekday music hours; after 1984, WEZE only played inspirational music on weekends for a few hours. = Later years = Salem exercised an option to acquire WBNW (590 AM) in the fall of 1996, and that December, began a simulcast that resulted in WEZE's call letters and programming moving to 590 kHz. Following a simulcast on both frequencies, 1260 become WPZE \\"Praise 1260\\" in February 1997. The Praise 1260 format included programs that Salem lacked the time to air on WEZE, along with about 6 hours a day of rhythmic Christian music. This consisted of upbeat praise and worship church music, gospel, and soft AC Christian cuts. However, in July, Salem sold the station to Hibernia Broadcasting,Site of the Week EXTRA: WMKI 1260 Boston (and friends) - Fybush Media which switched it to Radio Disney on November 21. (The Praise 1260 format was dropped earlier in that fall in preparation for the sale, and in the interim, WPZE returned to simulcasting WEZE). The station changed its call letters to WMKI late in December 1999 and was sold in a group deal to ABC, Inc., the owner of Radio Disney, in 2000. On August 13, 2014, Disney put WMKI and 22 other Radio Disney stations up for sale, to focus more on digital distribution of the Radio Disney network. On June 5, 2015, Disney filed to sell WMKI back to Salem Media Group.Parties to the Application - FCC Salem bought the station for $500,000.Salem Acquires Disney Stations in Boston and Dallas - Radio Insight Upon retaking control, Salem changed WMKI to WBIX, call letters that had previously been used on 1060 AM (now WQOM) from 2001 to 2010. The FCC approved the sale on August 4, 2015.Assignment of License - FCC As a result, the station discontinued its affiliation with Radio Disney. It went silent from August 12 to August 15. The sale was completed on September 10,Consummation Notice - FCC and the station went silent again until September 14. WBIX then changed to a conservative talk format, a format Salem had programmed in the market on WTTT (1150 AM, now WWDJ) from 2003 to 2008. WBIX was branded as \\"The Buzz\\", although many of Salem's other conservative talk stations are branded as \\"The Answer\\". It carried syndicated talk shows from the Salem Radio Network, including Hugh Hewitt, Mike Gallagher, Michael Medved, Larry Elder, Eric Metaxas, and Dennis Prager, and business programs, including Ray Lucia from the Business Talk Radio Network. Weekends included repeats of weekday shows, as well as \\"Money Talk\\" with Bob Brinker and a travel show with Rudy Maxa. News at the beginning of each hour came from Townhall.com and Salem Radio News (SRN). On January 3, 2018, Salem agreed to sell WBIX to the International Church of the Grace of God for $685,000; the new owners began programming the station under a local marketing agreement on January 8. At that time, the station changed to a Portuguese language format, branded \\"Nossa R√°dio USA\\". Nossa R√°dio's programming had been heard on WMVX (1570 AM, now WUBG) prior to 2017. The sale was completed on June 20, 2018.

From the representation theory point of view, a primary is the lowest dimension operator in a given representation of the conformal algebra. All other operators in a representation are called descendants; they can be obtained by acting on the primary with the raising generators. History of the concept Primary fields in a D-dimensional conformal field theory were introduced in 1969 by Mack and Salam where they were called interpolating fields. They were then studied by Ferrara, Gatto, and Grillo who called them irreducible conformal tensors, and by Mack who called them lowest weights. Polyakov used an equivalent definition as fields which cannot be represented as derivatives of other fields. The modern terms primary fields and descendants were introduced by Belavin, Polyakov and Zamolodchikov in the context of two-dimensional conformal field theory. This terminology is now used both for D=2 and D>2. Conformal field theory in D>2 spacetime dimensions The lowering generators of the conformal algebra in D>2 dimensions are the special conformal transformation generators K_\\\\mu. Primary operators inserted at x=0 are annihilated by these generators: [K_\\\\mu, \\\\mathcal{O}(0)]=0. The descendants are obtained by acting on the primaries with the translation generators P_\\\\mu; these are just the derivatives of the primaries. Conformal field theory in D2 dimensions In two dimensions, conformal field theories are invariant under an infinite dimensional Virasoro algebra with generators L_n, \\\\bar{L}_n, -\\\\infty. Primaries are defined as the operators annihilated by all L_n, \\\\bar{L}_n with n>0, which are the lowering generators. Descendants are obtained from the primaries by acting with L_n, \\\\bar{L}_n with n<0\\\\. The Virasoro algebra has a finite dimensional subalgebra generated by L_n, \\\\bar{L}_n, -1\\\\le n\\\\le 1. Operators annihilated by L_1, \\\\bar{L}_1 are called quasi-primaries. Each primary field is a quasi-primary, but the converse is not true; in fact each primary has infinitely many quasi- primary descendants. Quasi-primary fields in two-dimensional conformal field theory are the direct analogues of the primary fields in the D>2 dimensional case. Superconformal field theory In D\\\\le 6 dimensions, conformal algebra allows graded extensions containing fermionic generators. Quantum field theories invariant with respect to such extended algebras are called superconformal. In superconformal field theories, one considers superconformal primary operators. In D>2 dimensions, superconformal primaries are annihilated by K_\\\\mu and by the fermionic generators S (one for each supersymmetry generator). Generally, each superconformal primary representations will include several primaries of the conformal algebra, which arise by acting with the supercharges Q on the superconformal primary. There exist also special chiral superconformal primary operators, which are primary operators annihilated by some combination of the supercharges. In D=2 dimensions, superconformal field theories are invariant under super Virasoro algebras, which include infinitely many fermionic operators. Superconformal primaries are annihilated by all lowering operators, bosonic and fermionic. Unitarity bounds In unitary (super)conformal field theories, dimensions of primary operators satisfy lower bounds called the unitarity bounds. Roughly, these bounds say that the dimension of an operator must be not smaller than the dimension of a similar operator in free field theory. In four-dimensional conformal field theory, the unitarity bounds were first derived by Ferrara, Gatto and Grillo and by Mack.

A.18 OrganizationLeadership= The Glee Club is conducted by a member of the university faculty, and the work of running the organization has traditionally been divided between the director, the office manager, and a team of undergraduate student officers. The Glee Club's director generally holds a faculty position in the Yale School of Music as the Marshall Bartholomew Professor of Choral Conducting. A large part of the work of planning concert tours is done by student tour managers. =Current Membership= Most members of the Glee Club are undergraduate students, but the group also admits students from the graduate and professional schools. Membership in the group is determined each fall by audition. Members of the group may be majors in any subject. Many members of the group are also involved in other musical pursuits on campus. The Glee Club typically consists of 70 to 90 student singers. When large-scale classical choral works require more voices, the Glee Club may team up with Yale's other choruses, the Yale Camerata and the Yale Schola Cantorum, or add other singers as needed. =Past Membership= The Glee Club was initially composed of men only (since Yale College was only open to men). In 1969, Yale admitted its first female undergraduates, which led to the establishment of the Yale Women's Chorus. The following year, the Yale Women's Chorus was absorbed into the Glee Club to form a mixed chorus. Despite the fact that a glee club is typically an all-male chorus, the organization elected to retain its name. Although the group was once open to students only after their first year of college, in 2003 the Glee Club began to include undergraduates from all four years. Several alumni of the group have gone on to professional careers in music, including Charles Ives, Cole Porter, John Stewart and Marshall Bartholomew, both of whom returned to Yale to conduct the Glee Club. Programs The Glee Club works with New Haven high school students each year as part of an annual choral festival. Outreach and service activities incorporated into tours were a central focus of the Glee Club's 2007 domestic tour to the Gulf Coast states. The Glee Club's annual Emerging Composers Competition encourages new works for mixed chorus, and the Fenno Heath Award encourages the creation of new Yale songs. Both competitions were inaugurated in the fall of 2005 with the world premieres of Laus Trinitati by Jocelyn Hagen and A Modern Toast to Yale by Zachary Sandler. The Glee Club has an alumni association, the Yale Glee Club Associates,Yale Glee Club Associates which offers advice and financial support to the Glee Club. The YGCA has formed a chorus of its own called the Yale Alumni Chorus.Yale Alumni Chorus This chorus gives alumni an opportunity to resume old friendships and enjoy the songs of their Glee Club years while traveling and giving concerts in foreign countries. History Like many of the old American college Glee Clubs, the Yale Glee Club began as a small association of students to sing glees. This tradition was continued for most of the 19th and early 20th century. Many of these original songs are maintained as part of the Glee Club's \\"Blue Book\\" (Songs of Yale), which contains the old glees and the principal Yale songs. =Directors= The Yale Glee Club has had seven directors since the appointment of its first faculty adviser: *c. 1868-1873: Gustave J. Stoeckel *1873-1905: Thomas G. Shepard *1905-1921: G. Frank Goodale (Yale Sheffield Scientific School B.S. 1889) *1921-1953: Marshall Bartholomew (Yale Sheffield Scientific School B.S. 1907) *1953-1992: Fenno F.

Connell (Yale D.M.A. 1991) *2002-2003: Timothy Snyder (Yale M.M. 1998) (interim director) *2003‚Äìpresent: Jeffrey Douma The group's fourth director, Marshall Bartholomew, encouraged the group to undertake more difficult and classical works, adding considerably to the group's repertoire. He created arrangements of many spirituals and folk songs, many published by the G. Schirmer company as the \\"Yale Glee Club Series.\\" Bartholomew's successor, Fenno Heath, composed many original works and after 1970 rearranged many of his own and Bartholomew's pieces for mixed chorus when the Glee Club admitted women. David Connell continued the tradition of arranging pieces for the group, including madrigals and sea chanteys. Director Jeffrey Douma has also contributed his own arrangements to the Glee Club's library. Under his direction, the Glee Club has appeared in performances guest conducted by David Willcocks, Krzysztof Penderecki, Sir Neville Marriner, and Helmuth Rilling. Tours The Glee Club has regularly made domestic tours since 1866 and international concert tours since 1928. Domestic tours occur annually and international tours typically occur every two or three years. Touring has helped the Glee Club find a mission as \\"ambassadors of song.\\" Today, tours are managed by a pair of current Glee Clubbers. The position of Tour Co-Manager is the only Glee Club office that is not chosen by election; rather, the director and staff manager appoint tour managers based on their submission of a proposed itinerary. Prospective tour co-managers write their proposal and apply together. The Glee Club was one of the first U.S. college musical groups to tour abroad. International destinations of its many tours have included: *Seventeen tours of Europe, with the original 1928 tour retraced for the Glee Club's 150th Anniversary in 2011 *South and/or Central America in 1941, 1961, 1968, 1975, and 2009 *A \\"'Round- the-world\\" tour in 1965 *East Asia in 1996 *Bermuda or the Caribbean in 1930, 1951, 2000, 2010, and 2014 *Five countries in Africa in 2002 *New Zealand and Australia in 2005 *Istanbul with the Yale Alumni Chorus in 2011 *Mainland China and Hong Kong in 2013 ReferencesExternal links *Yale Glee Club official web site *Yale Alumni Chorus Foundation official web site *DeWerff, Timothy J. \\"Louder Yet the Chorus Raise!\\": An Illustrated History of the Yale Glee Club, 1861‚Äì2011.

It includes of protected beachfront on the Pacific Ocean in Northern California on State Route 1, north of Point Arena. The park features sand dunes, flat grasslands and five miles of gentle, sandy beachfront. The park is noted for steelhead and salmon fishing in the park's two streams, Brush Creek and Alder Creek, as well as the driftwood that collects in the catch basin created by the gently curved coastline. The site was established as a California state park in 1955 and takes its name from Manchester, California, seven miles north of Point Arena. Aside from the coastal views, Manchester State Beach consists of grazing lands with flocks of sheep, and herds of cattle. Blue Irises, baby blue eyes, lupines, poppies, and sea pinks are featured in the park‚Äôs variety of wildflowers. Just off shore, the San Andreas Fault runs into the waters of the park. From October to April, Humpback whales and Gray whales can be spotted offshore during the annual migration. Right off the coast of Arena Point, experienced divers can dive from boats to view kelp forests and other marine life found in the park's protected waters. Camping is available on a first come, first served basis. Reservations are required and group campgrounds are available until the 16th of November. Marine Protected Areas The Point Arena State Marine Reserve & Point Arena State Marine Conservation Area are two marine protected areas that extend offshore from Point Arena. Sea Lion Cove State Marine Conservation Area and Saunders Reef State Marine Conservation Area lie south of Point Arena. Like underwater parks, these marine protected areas help conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems. History Before European contact, Manchester was the territory of the Pomo people, the native peoples at the time. Over time, the Pomo were gradually integrated into white society. Manchester State Park was one of 70 California state parks proposed for closure by July 2012 as part of a deficit reduction program. It was previously one of many state parks threatened with closure in 2008. Those closures were ultimately avoided by cutting hours and maintenance system-wide. Climate Temperatures range from a high of 72 degrees Fahrenheit to a low of 50 degrees Fahrenheit. The park experiences heavy rainfall from September to May with evening fog common throughout the summer months. There are strong winds year- round and warm clothing is recommended. Visiting the Park The hike to Alder Creek is a five-mile round trip hike consisting of walks along the beach and through the woods. Arriving at Alder Creek, many waterfowl and spawning salmon can be seen depending on the time of year. Throughout the year, strong winds blast the park's bluffs and beaches. Hikers are advised to check the wind report before planning a trip to Manchester State Beach. As a visitor to the park, expect to see a vast driftwood collection along the coastline of the park. Hikers and visitors will find themselves climbing over piles of driftwood scattered across the beach. Near the park‚Äôs south boundary, people can go on tours of the historic Pt. Arena Lighthouse built in 1870. The beach is complemented by an upland area that offers visitors loop trails that venture alongside ponds, through dark sand, and up and around bluffs and dunes. The main trailhead can be accessed seven-miles north of Point Arena on Kinney road where the park provides signage to direct visitors to the trailheads. Throughout the park, unique wind shelters built out of driftwood, by beach-goers, are featured alongside the bluffs and along the beach. A connector trail can be taken to Alder Creek where a condemned beach house can be seen and explored a half mile into the trail.

It is noted for its architecture and its historical role during the German occupation of France in World War II.  History Early Years= The Lutetia was built in 1910 in the Art Nouveau style to designs by architects Louis-Charles Boileau and Henri Tauzin. It was founded by the Bon March√© department store, which sits opposite it facing Square Boucicaut. The Lutetia is located at the intersection of Boulevard Raspail and rue de S√®vres, adjacent to the S√®vres-Babylone M√©tro station. The hotel is named for an early pre-Roman town that existed where Paris is now located. Famous guests over the years have included Pablo Picasso, Charles de Gaulle, Marianne Oswald, Andr√© Gide, Peggy Guggenheim and Josephine Baker.

In the Nazi regime's propaganda of the time, these exiles were called disparagingly \\"The Lutetia Crowd\\". The war began in September 1939, and numerous refugees fled to Paris from conflict areas and places occupied by German forces. The Lutetia attempted to accommodate as many as possible. Because of its reputation, it was filled with a number of displaced artists and musicians. However, the French government evacuated Paris beginning June 14, 1940 and the Germans entered and occupied the city. A number of the Lutetia's residents escaped; others were captured by the Germans. The hotel itself was requisitioned by the Abwehr (counter-espionage), and used to house, feed, and entertain the officers in command of the occupation, such as Alfred Toepfer and the French collaborator Rudy de M√©rode. When Paris was liberated in August 1944, the hotel was abandoned by German troops, and taken over by French and American forces. From then until after the end of the war, it was used as a repatriation center for prisoners of war, displaced persons, and returnees from the German concentration camps. = Recent history = As Paris returned to normality, the Lutetia was restored to its previous state as a luxury hotel. It was acquired by the Taittinger family in 1955. In the late 1980s, designer Sonia Rykiel opened a boutique in the building, and supervised a major redesign intended to recreate the Art Deco style of earlier decades. Taittinger's Groupe du Louvre controlled the hotel for many years as part of their Concorde Hotels & Resorts chain. Following Taittinger's sale to Starwood Capital in 2005, Starwood sold the H√¥tel Lutetia to the Israeli Alrov group in 2010 for 150 Million Euros. Alrov closed the hotel in April 2014 for what was planned as a 100-million Euro renovation. The building's contents were sold at auction in May 2014. It reopened in July 2018, following a $234 million restoration, managed by The Set Hotels group.

(The magnetic moment, also called magnetic dipole moment, is a measure of the strength of a magnetic source.) The \\"Dirac\\" magnetic moment, corresponding to tree-level Feynman diagrams (which can be thought of as the classical result), can be calculated from the Dirac equation. It is usually expressed in terms of the g-factor; the Dirac equation predicts g = 2. For particles such as the electron, this classical result differs from the observed value by a small fraction of a percent. The difference is the anomalous magnetic moment, denoted a and defined as : a = \\\\frac{g-2}{2}  Electron  One-loop correction to a fermion's magnetic dipole moment. The one-loop contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment‚Äîcorresponding to the first and largest quantum mechanical correction‚Äîof the electron is found by calculating the vertex function shown in the adjacent diagram. The calculation is relatively straightforward and the one-loop result is: : a_e = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2 \\\\pi} \\\\approx 0.001\\\\; 161\\\\; 4 where \\\\alpha is the fine structure constant. This result was first found by Julian Schwinger in 1948 and is engraved on his tombstone. As of 2016, the coefficients of the QED formula for the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron are known analytically up to \\\\alpha^3 and have been calculated up to order \\\\alpha^5: :a_e = 0.001\\\\; 159\\\\; 652\\\\; 181\\\\; 643(764) The QED prediction agrees with the experimentally measured value to more than 10 significant figures, making the magnetic moment of the electron the most accurately verified prediction in the history of physics. (See precision tests of QED for details.) The current experimental value and uncertainty is: :a_e = 0.001\\\\; 159\\\\; 652\\\\; 180\\\\; 73 (28) According to this value, a_e is known to an accuracy of around 1 part in 1 billion (109). This required measuring g to an accuracy of around 1 part in 1 trillion (1012).  Muon  MSSM corrections to the muon g‚àí2 involving a neutralino and a smuon, and a chargino and a muon sneutrino respectively. The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is calculated in a similar way to the electron. The prediction for the value of the muon anomalous magnetic moment includes three parts: :\\\\begin{align}a_\\\\mu^\\\\mathrm{SM} &= a_\\\\mu^\\\\mathrm{QED} + a_\\\\mu^\\\\mathrm{EW} + a_\\\\mu^\\\\mathrm{Hadron} &= 0.001\\\\; 165\\\\; 918\\\\; 04 (51)\\\\end{align} Of the first two components, a_\\\\mu^\\\\mathrm{QED} represents the photon and lepton loops, and a_\\\\mu^\\\\mathrm{EW} the W boson, Higgs boson and Z boson loops; both can be calculated precisely from first principles. The third term, a_\\\\mu^\\\\mathrm{Hadron}, represents hadron loops; it cannot be calculated accurately from theory alone. It is estimated from experimental measurements of the ratio of hadronic to muonic cross sections (R) in electron‚Äìantielectron (e^-e^+) collisions. As of July 2017, the measurement disagrees with the Standard Model by 3.5 standard deviations, suggesting physics beyond the Standard Model may be having an effect (or that the theoretical/experimental errors are not completely under control). This is one of the long-standing discrepancies between the Standard Model and experiment. The E821 experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) studied the precession of muon and antimuon in a constant external magnetic field as they circulated in a confining storage ring. The E821 Experiment reported the following average value :a_\\\\mu = 0.001\\\\; 165\\\\; 920\\\\; 9 (6). A new experiment at Fermilab called \\"Muon g‚àí2\\" using the E821 magnet will improve the accuracy of this value. Data taking began in March 2018 and is expected to end in September 2022. Tau The Standard Model prediction for tau's anomalous magnetic dipole moment is :a_\\\\tau=0.001\\\\; 177\\\\; 21 (5), while the best measured bound for a_\\\\tau is :-0.052 < a_\\\\tau < +0.013.  Composite particles  Composite particles often have a huge anomalous magnetic moment. This is true for the proton, which is made up of charged quarks, and the neutron, which has a magnetic moment even though it is electrically neutral.

(2000). A Complete History of Fighting Dogs, (Chapter 19). Howell Book House Inc. History The Blue Paul Terrier's origins are disputed but it was once numerous in various parts of Scotland. One story of the Blue Paul Terrier's origins is that John Paul Jones brought them from abroad and when he visited his native town of Kirkcudbright around 1770. The gypsies around the Kirkintilloch district kept Blue Paul Terriers for dog fighting, and they claimed the dogs came from the Galloway coast. A more likely story is a British military officer posted to the Glasgow area brought with him an Irish Blue Terrier bitch from the Earl of Kerry's kennels, when he was reposted he left his bitch with friends who bred her with a white bull and terrier of the Duke of Hamilton's breeding to create the breed. Another story states the breed descend from a bitch named Blue Poll from a village near Newcastle, and that a visiting Scotsman purchased several of her pups and returned with them to his homeland. The Blue Paul Terrier was clearly a bull and terrier cross that was most likely bred from bulldogs and terriers in Scotland with infusions other similar dogs brought from England and Ireland. The breed was very popular in Scotland in the mid 19th century, but it progressively lost popularity and is believed to have become extinct in the early 20th century. DescriptionAppearance= The Blue Paul Terrier weighed around , sources vary about its height, some state it stood around at the shoulder, others as tall as . The breed resembled early bull terriers. The Blue Paul Terrier's head was large, its forehead was flat, short, square and broad but not receding like that of the bulldog, its jaws and teeth were even with no overhanging flews. They had a slight dip between the eyes, which were dark hazel and not sunken, prominent, nor showing haw, its eyebrows were contracted or knit. The ears were small, thin, high set and usually cropped, and the face was not wrinkled. The facial expression of the Blue Paul Terrier has never been seen in any other breed, although it is frequently recognised in some mixed-breed dogs. The Blue Paul Terrier had a smooth coat, the usual colour was dark blue, similar to some Greyhounds, however some were brindle or red, known as red smuts. =Temperament= The Blue Paul Terrier was known for its courage and strength, it was said to be game to the death and could suffer great punishment, when fighting they were considered expert and tricky in their tactics, making them great favorites with those who indulged in dog fighting.

Originally a boys' school, it started admitting girls in 1975. On March 3, 2015, NYMA filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and was sold at auction to Chinese-owned foundation Research Center on Natural Conservation Inc. which reopened the school in November 2015. The Research Center then poured millions of dollars into the campus to support instruction and capital improvements. The campus also has been host to popular camps like Camp All America into the 1980s and currently the NYMA Leadership Program. It is famous for admitting current President Donald Trump between 1959 and 1964. History NYMA has a long history as a university-preparatory school with a military structure that enrolls students from the New York metropolitan area as well as around the country and the world. It was founded in 1889 by American Civil War veteran and former schoolteacher from New Hampshire Charles Jefferson Wright, a former Commandant of Cadets of the nearby Peekskill Military Academy. Wright's successor, Sebastian Jones, presided over the academy from 1894 to 1922, guiding it during its most critical period of growth from a young and small institution of 48 cadets, through a disastrous fire in 1910, and throughout an extensive reconstruction program. 103 students were enrolled in 2019. During the years 1959-1963, the superintendent was Nathan Dingley III, a veteran of World War I and World War II. On Oct. 12, 1963, the school's drill team participated in the Columbus Day Parade, led by commanding officer Donald J. Trump. The academy previously admitted students as early the fifth grade. Gradually throughout the mid-to-late 1990s, grades five and six were no longer accepted. By the 1999-2000 school-year, the academy only accepted students from the seventh grade on. The seventh grade was removed in the mid-2000s; the school today only accepts grades eight through twelve. In some of its early years, the campus also hosted a non-military \\"NYMA Lower School\\" for grades one through six.) Over time, the campus expanded from to a peak of , and enrollment peaked at 525 students during the 1960s. Girls have been admitted since 1975. NYMA is a member of the Association of Military Colleges and Schools of the United States as well as several other school associations. =Financial difficulties= Due to financial problems and enrollment that had dwindled to 145 students, the school was scheduled to close in June 2010. However, a group of alumni and local business people created a plan to save the school, raising almost $6 million of financing in a matter of weeks, and expecting to sell off some less-utilized portions of the campus. The academy failed to open in September 2015 for the fall semester, and instead headed to bankruptcy auction. On September 30, NYMA was auctioned for $15.825 million to the Chinese-owned Research Center on Natural Conservation Inc., a non-profit corporation led by billionaire Vincent Tianquan Mo, Chairman and CEO of SouFun Holdings, an NYSE-listed company, also operating as Fang Holdings Ltd., one of China's largest real estate internet portals. The foundation also purchased the nearby E.H. Harriman Estate in 2011 and the former Pace University's 37-acre campus in Briarcliff Manor in 2017. The school reopened on November 2, 2015, with \\"a handful of returning students\\" and a recruitment drive. For 2016‚Äì17, the academic year began with a total of 29 students. By 2019 the school had grown to a size of 100 male and female Cadets both day and boarding with 12 nations represented and an additional 1,000 students attending special programs throughout the year. Location NYMA Main Gate (2006 photo) NYMA students in uniform, 1964. Includes future President Donald Trump (second from left). The school is located in the town of Cornwall, New York, and uses the mailing address of the village Cornwall-on-Hudson despite being just outside its official boundary. Geographically, the academy is in the Hudson Highlands, at the foot of Storm King Mountain, just west of the Hudson River and north of West Point. NYMA is approximately north of New York City, or about one hour by car. This places NYMA in the Mid-Hudson region of the Hudson Valley, which is accessible by airplane (KSWF, KEWR, KLGA, KJFK, KALB) as well as train (Amtrak and Metro-North), bus (Short Line), and automobile. Student life The days at NYMA typically begin at 6:00 am and end at 10:00 pm. Cadets attend classes that match their needs during that time and also participate in interscholastic or intramural sports, activities, and study hall. During closed weekends, cadets are expected to attend additional leadership training, drill & ceremony, and maintain the appearance of their respective barracks. Upon gaining the opportunity for an open weekend, cadets in good academic standing can apply for weekend furlough. Along with Academics, Athletics, and Leadership, the fourth \\"pillar\\" of cadet life is Character, reinforced continually by the Cadet Honor Code that NYMA shares with West Point. =Organization= Cadets on parade (2004 photo) The structure of the Corps of Cadets is adjusted depending on the number of students enrolled at the academy. As a military school, the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC) is a key component, and participation is required to graduate. The battalion has typically consisted of: * Command Staff * Band Company * Line Companies: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Foxtrot and Golf * Delta troop or \\"D-troop\\": a cavalry unit drawn from the equestrian program (not running currently) =Athletics= NYMA has competed in Football, Basketball, Baseball, Soccer, Bowling, Lacrosse, Rugby, Swimming, Softball, Track & Field, Volleyball, Cross-Country, Wrestling, Tennis, Rifle Team, Golf, Drill Team, and Raiders. Every cadet is generally required to compete year-round. The school's mascot is the Knight. Teams have competed in the Hudson Valley Athletic League, a member league of the New England Preparatory School Athletic Conference (NEPSAC). NYMA is reigning champion of New England Preparatory School Athletic Conference Basketball \\"D\\" class 2018. In 2019, NYMA expanded its accomplishments to not only include the boys New England Preparatory School Athletic Conference Basketball \\"D\\" class championship but also won the girls NEPSAC championship class \\"E\\" as well. =Hazing= In earlier decades, NYMA's official regulations permitted a certain level of hazing and physical discipline by supervisors and older cadets, although the academy's senior administrators were forced to resign after a particularly severe incident in 1964. While hazing later became forbidden by the school's rules and policies, a lawsuit was settled in which it had been claimed that physical and emotional abuse in the form of hazing had taken place in 2005. NYMA cited adverse publicity from the 2005 incident as one of the reasons the school nearly closed in 2010.

Early life Koppelman was born to a Jewish family, the son of RuthNew York Times: \\"Paid Notice: Deaths KOPPELMAN, RUTH\\" July 22, 1997 and Irving Koppelman.New York Times: \\"Paid Notice: Deaths KOPPELMAN, IRVING\\" August 10, 2000 His uncle, Morris Koppelman, held a patent for inventing the egg carton. Career Koppelman broke into the music business as a member of the musical group The Ivy Three which had a Top 10 hit in 1960 entitled \\"Yogi\\", after the cartoon Yogi Bear. Soon, Koppelman and bandmate and future business partner Don Rubin joined the songwriting staff of Aldon Music under CEO Don Kirshner, a group that included Carole King, Neil Sedaka, Barry Mann, and Cynthia Weil. When Columbia Pictures purchased Aldon Music, Koppelman was promoted to director of Screen Gems/Columbia Music, the new company that resulted from the merger. In 1965, with financial backing of his uncle, Leon Koppelman, Koppelman and Rubin left Columbia to form Koppelman/Rubin Associates, an entertainment company that signed The Lovin Spoonful the same year. In 1967, Koppleman/Rubin signed The Little Bits of Sound, a group from Long Island, New York with a psychedelic sound. In 1968, Commonwealth United purchased Koppelman/Rubin Associates and Koppelman and Rubin stayed on to run the music division. In 1968 they signed the psychedelic band the Rahgoos and famously made the band change its name to Gandalf. During the early 1970s, Koppelman moved on to CBS Records and held numerous positions, including Vice President/National Director of A&R; where he signed acts including Billy Joel, Dave Mason, Janis Ian, Journey, and Phoebe Snow. By the mid-1970s, Koppelman had stepped up to Vice President/General Manager of worldwide publishing for CBS Records. In 1975, he formed The Entertainment Company with Martin Bandier and New York real estate developer and Bandier's father-in-law, Samuel LeFrak. The company independently administered and promoted song catalogs and produced music artists like Barbra Streisand, Dolly Parton, Diana Ross, the Four Tops, and Cher. By 1981 the Entertainment Company had grown into a production company with its own staff of producers and 20 in-house songwriters and in 1984, they purchased the Combine Music catalog of 25,000 country songs. Around that time Koppelman's son, Brian Koppelman, then a student at Tufts University in Boston, discovered musician Tracy Chapman and brought her to his father who soon signed her to a record deal. In 1986, Koppelman, Bandier, and Stephen C. Swid formed SBK Entertainment World, Inc., in order to buy the 250,000 titles owned by CBS Songs for $125 million, the highest price ever paid for a music publishing portfolio. SBK developed into the largest independent music publisher in the world and played a major role in the careers of artists like Michael Bolton, Robbie Robertson, New Kids on the Block, Icehouse, Al B. Sure!, and Eric B. & Rakim. In 1989, SBK Entertainment World, Inc. was sold to EMI Music for $300 million. As part of the deal, Koppelman and Bandier formed a partnership with EMI Music Worldwide to create their own record label, SBK Records. In addition, Koppelman took the positions of Chairman and CEO of the new label and Chairman of EMI Music Publishing. Bandier received the posts of President and Chief Operating Officer of SBK Records and Vice Chairman of EMI Music Publishing. Only one year after SBK Records opened, they received their first platinum album with Technotronic's Pump Up the Jam. SBK Records went on to sign artists Jesus Jones, Wilson Phillips, and Vanilla Ice, among others. In 1991, Koppelman and Bandier sold their share of SBK Records to EMI Music, making EMI the sole owner of the label. When EMI Music decided to consolidate its operations and formed EMI Records Group North America, Koppelman was subsequently appointed Chairman and CEO. During his time at EMI, Koppelman played an integral role in the reunion of singer Frank Sinatra with Capitol Records, which spawned the five-million-selling album Duets. Koppelman served as CEO until 1997. From 2000 to 2004 Koppelman was Chairman of Steve Madden, Ltd., and led the company while Madden served jail time for securities fraud. In 2005, Koppelman was appointed Chairman of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. Koppelman also appeared as Martha Stewart's right-hand man on NBC's The Apprentice: Martha Stewart in 2005. He served as de facto CEO of the Company from 2008-2011 when he stepped down to expand his company, CAK Entertainment. Since 2010, Koppelman has served as director at Six Flags Entertainment Corporation and also currently sits on the Board of Directors of Las Vegas Sands.

Originally it was called the West Point Bullion Depository. At one point it had the highest concentration of silver of any U.S. mint facility, and for 12 years produced circulating pennies. It has since minted mostly commemorative coins and stored gold. It gained official status as a branch of the United States Mint on March 31, 1988. Later that year it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Building Prior to its remodel in 2005 that added a second story, the mint was a one-story reinforced concrete structure with a flat roof. The walls are mostly featureless with some recessed arches at the entryways. There are four turrets at the corners actively used in the building's security. It is on a four-acre (1.6 ha) parcel of land near the northern facilities of the United States Military Academy, with parking lots on either side. The interior contains minting presses and bullion compartments. History As of 1937, it served as a storage facility for silver bullion and was thus nicknamed \\"The Fort Knox of Silver.\\" Even without United States Mint status, it produced U.S. coinage. From 19741974 Annual Report of the Director of the Mint through 1986, the West Point Mint produced Lincoln cents bearing no mint mark, making them indistinguishable from those produced at the Philadelphia Mint. The years 1977 to 1979 saw Washington quarters produced as well. Approximately 20 billion dollars' worth of gold was stored in its vaults in the early 1980s (although this was still significantly less than at Fort Knox). September 1983 saw the first appearance of the \\"W\\" mint mark (from this still unofficial U.S. Mint) on a $10 gold coin commemorating the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games. This was the first legal tender U.S. gold coin since 1933. In 1986, American Gold Eagle bullion coins were solely produced at this facility, again with no mint mark. The West Point Bullion Depository was granted mint status on March 31, 1988 (). Starting in 1999 American Silver Eagle bullion coins were also produced at the mint. In 2002, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point was honored for its 200th anniversary, and a bicentennial commemorative silver dollar was issued and unveiled on March 16 of that year, featuring a cadet color guard on the obverse and the helmet of Pallas Athena on the reverse. The coin was produced only at the West Point Mint. Special West Point Coinage An unusual coinage from West Point occurred in 1996, when a commemorative Roosevelt dime was produced for the 50th anniversary of the design. Given as an insert with the standard mint sets sold that year, over 1.457 million were produced. Thus, although this \\"W\\" mint marked dime is not particularly scarce, it was made only for collectors. In 2015 another \\"W\\" mint marked dime was issued along with a 2015-W dollar, these as part of a three coin set to commemorate the March of Dimes. Only 75,000 sets were produced.75th Anniversary March of Dimes Sets In 2014, a reverse proof silver Kennedy Half Dollar which was part of a commemorative set, along with the 24K gold proof Kennedy Half Dollar were produced there to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Kennedy Half Dollar, again with the \\"W\\" mint mark. In 2015, the West Point Mint struck Sacagawea Dollars for the first time. Released as part of a special ‚ÄúNative American Coin and Currency Set‚Äù, only 90,000 were produced. The first cents to display the \\"W\\" mint mark were produced for collectors in 2019. These West Point Lincoln cents were added to traditional mint and proof sets and were be minted in three different finishes. An uncirculated 2019-W cent was included with uncirculated set, a proof 2019-W cent was included with the proof set, and a reverse proof 2019-W cent was included with silver proof set. There are no mintage limits for these sets and individual buyers are not limited in the quantities they can order. On April 2, 2019 the United States Mint announced that 10 million quarters would be placed into circulation containing the \\"W\\" mint mark in an effort to promote the hobby of coin collecting. Although quarters have been produced at the West Point Mint before, none of them included the \\"W\\" mint mark. These quarters are a part of the \\"America the Beautiful\\" quarters program; 2 million of each of the five national park quarters released in 2019 will contain the \\"W\\" mint mark. This was continued in 2020, with the 2020 coins including a special \\"V 75\\" privy mark commemorating the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II. On January 10, 2020, the United States Mint announced that each of the three annual sets released in 2020 would include a \\"W\\" mint marked Jefferson nickel, just as was done with the Lincoln Cents the previous year. An uncirculated nickel was included with the uncirculated coin set, a proof nickel with the clad proof set, and a reverse proof nickel with the silver proof set. Present Today all American Eagle series proof and uncirculated bullion coins in gold, silver, platinum, and palladium are produced at West Point, along with all gold commemorative and a few silver commemorative coins. Bullion and proof gold Eagles and some uncirculated and all proof silver Eagles, as well as all commemoratives from West Point are struck with the \\"W\\" mint mark. Since 2006, the West Point Mint has also made all American Buffalo gold bullion coins. The West Point Mint still acts as a gold bullion depository, and silver is kept on site only in quantities to meet minting demands. Due to the presence of so much gold bullion on site, security is high. The mint does not give public tours, and its address is withheld by the National Park Service in its National Register listings.

Since its founding in 1912 as the Authors League of America, it has counted among its board members notable authors of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry, including numerous winners of the Nobel and Pulitzer Prizes and National Book Awards. It has over 9,000 members, who receive free legal advice and guidance on contracts with publishers as well as insurance services and assistance with subsidiary licensing and royalties. The group lobbies at the national and state levels on censorship and tax concerns, and it has initiated or supported several major lawsuits in defense of authors' copyrights. In one of those, a class-action suit claiming that Google acted illegally when it scanned millions of copyrighted books without permission, the Authors Guild lost on appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Recently the Authors Guild has fought the consolidation of the publishing industry through the mergers of large publishers, and it has pressed the publishers to increase royalty rates for ebooks. History The original Authors League of America was organized with headquarters in New York City in order \\"to protect the rights of all authors, whether engaged in literary, dramatic, artistic, or musical competition, and to advise and assist all such authors\\". In 1921, the Dramatists Guild of America split off as a separate group to represent writers of stage and radio drama. Past presidents of the Authors Guild have included the novelists Pearl S. Buck, Rex Stout and Madeleine L'Engle, the biographers Anne Edwards and Robert Caro, the journalists Herbert Mitgang and J. Anthony Lukas, and the historians William Shirer and Robert Massie. In 2019, the guild's members elected Douglas Preston as president and Monique Truong as vice president.  Freelancers' suit  In June 2014, the guild announced final approval of an $18 million settlement of a class-action suit it brought in 2000, along with the American Society of Journalists and Authors, the National Writers Union and 21 freelance writers. The suit claimed that major electronics databases such as Lexis-Nexis had violated the rights of thousands of freelancers. Their work had originally appeared in newspapers and magazines including The New York Times and Time magazine and had then been resold to the databases without the writers' permission. The publishers had argued that the databases constituted a fair \\"revision\\" of the original print articles, but the United States Supreme Court ruled in June 2001 that the writers must be compensated for their digital rights. Further litigation and negotiation led to a settlement that will provide payments to the freelancers of up to $1,500 per article.  Conflict with Google  On September 20, 2005, the Authors Guild, together with Herbert Mitgang, Betty Miles and Daniel Hoffman, filed a class action lawsuit against Google for its Book Search project. According to the Authors Guild, Google was committing copyright infringement by making digital copies of books that were still protected by copyright. (Google countered that their use was fair according to US copyright law.) On October 28, 2008, the Authors Guild, the Association of American Publishers, and Google announced that they had settled Authors Guild v. Google. Google agreed to a $125 million payout, $45 million of that to be paid to rightsholders whose books were scanned without permission. The Google Book Search Settlement Agreement allowed for legal protection for Google's scanning project, even though neither side changed its position about whether scanning books was fair use or copyright infringement. The Settlement also would have established a new regulatory organization, the Book Rights Registry, which would be responsible for allocating fees from Google to rightsholders. The settlement between the Authors Guild and Google was rejected in 2011 by a judge at the district court level, who thought the settlement was not in the authors' best interest. In October 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit sided with Google citing fair use and that the scanned and posted excerpts works do not harm the authors by having parts of the books online. In late December 2015, the Authors Guild filed a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court against Google in their long-standing battle over whether copyright laws allow for the search engine to scan and post excerpts from books for the Google Books service, which in April 2016 declined to review the case, leaving the lower court's decision standing.

CareerLeicestershire= Smith played for the Leicestershire second team for a couple of years as a teenager before making his first-class debut in the 1990 season in a game against Oxford University; he was lbw for four in his only innings, but got another chance in a County Championship match against Glamorgan a fortnight later. He made 15 not out in the first innings before Leicestershire declared, and not batting at all in the second. He did not play another first-class game that season, though he did make a handful of appearances in the Refuge Assurance League. Smith went on the 1990-91 Under-19 tour to New Zealand, and played in all five of their matches (two \\"ODIs\\" and three \\"Tests\\"). He made no real impression with the bat, with a top score of only 44, but had some success as a bowler, taking the wicket of future New Zealand senior team captain Stephen Fleming on three occasions in the \\"Tests\\". Back in England, he had a reasonable 1991 season, making 674 first-class runs at an average of 37.44, although the highest of his 23 innings was only 71. Smith then went through a lean spell, and despite a maiden hundred against Durham in April 1992, the nadir came in the 1993 season when Smith averaged a low 14.61 in 18 first-class innings, being dismissed in single figures on 11 occasions and only once passing fifty. Some recovery followed as he averaged just over 30 in each of the following two years, but it was 1996 that saw him return to form with three centuries including 190 against Glamorgan in August, and passing a thousand runs in a first-class season for the first time, finishing with 1,243 at 47.80 and helping Leicestershire to their first County Championship since 1975. Two more good seasons followed, and in the final Championship game of the 1998 season Smith made his highest first-class score of 204 against Surrey as Leicestershire defeated their opponents by an innings and 211 runs. He stayed at Leicestershire for another couple of seasons, rising to the position of vice- captain, before unrest within the club led to his resignation to join Worcestershire for 2002. Meanwhile, he had enjoyed two productive seasons with Central Districts in New Zealand, hitting 201 not out against Canterbury in 2001-02 in a match where his team had lost their first three wickets by the time seven runs were on the board. cricket Ireland batting coach =Worcestershire= Smith found immediate success at his new county, averaging 44.51 and making four hundreds in 2002, as well as averaging over 50 in List A cricket for a combined first-class and one-day total of 2,024 runs. He was appointed captain for the 2003 season, replacing Graeme Hick, and continued in fine form that summer. However, he resigned the captaincy in the middle of the match against Northamptonshire in August 2004, handing over to Steve Rhodes for the remainder of the season on the grounds that he wanted to concentrate on his form with the bat. In 2005 he passed 1,400 first-class runs in a season for the first time, although his form in one-day cricket was less impressive. In the final first-class match of the season, against Essex at New Road, he put on 333 for the fourth wicket with Stephen Moore before the latter was caught for 191. This established a new county record partnership for this wicket, beating the 281 that Younis Ahmed and Alan Ormrod had put on in 1979. Smith's 2006 season was rather less successful: he failed to reach 1,000 first-class runs for the first time since 2000, hitting 915 runs at 36.60 including one score of 203 he made against Somerset in June. His form tailed off towards the end of the season, and in his last five matches he made only 163 runs in nine innings. In one-day cricket he scored 487 runs at 34.79, his highest average for four seasons.

Weeks (DD-701), an , was named for John Wingate Weeks, who attained the rank of rear admiral. Weeks was elected to the United States House of Representatives where he served until entering the United States Senate in 1913. He became Secretary of War on 4 March 1921. John W. Weeks was laid down on 17 January 1944 by Federal Ship Building & Dry Dock Co., Kearny, New Jersey. The ship was launched on 21 May 1944; sponsored by Mrs. John W. Davidge, daughter of Secretary Weeks. The ship was commissioned on 21 July 1944, Commander Robert A. Theobald. Jr., in command. Service history1940s= After shakedown out of Bermuda and tests en route to Argentina, the new destroyer departed New York on 10 November 1944, escorting the battleships , , and aircraft carriers and to the Pacific. She transited the Panama Canal and touched San Francisco, Pearl Harbor, and Eniwetok before joining the 3rd Fleet at Ulithi 27 December. Early in January 1945, John W. Weeks sortied from that busy lagoon with Vice Admiral John S. McCain's Fast Carrier Task Force TF 38 and headed toward the Philippines in the screen of Rear Admiral Gerald F. Bogan's task group. Meanwhile, the mighty Luzon Attack Force assembled in Leyte Gulf on New Year's Day, passed through Surigao Strait, and set course for Lingayen Gulf. On 9 January, as General Douglas MacArthur's troops landed on the beaches at Lingayen, planes from McCain's carriers hit Japanese airstrips on Formosa and the Pescadores to neutralize air opposition to the Luzon invasion. That night McCain's ships slipped through Luzon Strait into the South China Sea where they could be on call to support the Allied beachheads while striking strategic enemy positions along the southeastern coast of Asia and searching for the Imperial Fleet. In the next 10 days, they lashed out at Hong Kong, Hainan, and the Indochinese coast causing much damage ashore and sinking 44 ships totaling 132,700 tons. At the end of this sweep into enemy waters Admiral William Halsey reported, \\"the outer defenses of the Japanese Empire no longer include Burma and the Netherlands East Indies; those countries are now isolated outposts, and their products are no longer available to the Japanese war machine...\\" John W. Weeks returned with her carriers to Ulithi on 28 January. The destroyer again sailed with the carriers on 11 February, and conducted strikes on Tokyo on 16‚Äì17 February, in preinvasion support of the Allied attack on Iwo Jima. After inflicting considerable damage to Japanese air power, John W. Weeks steamed toward Iwo Jima to give direct support to Marines fighting for the island. Later that month, the carriers renewed their attacks on the enemy's home islands. Heavy raids during March continued to cripple the enemy's power, and the destroyer received credit for two assists as five enemy planes were splashed while attempting a raid on the Task Force. When D-day for the Okinawa invasion neared, Weeks in company with other units shelled the shores in preinvasion bombardment. The assault forces landed on 1 April, and the destroyer stood by to offer support. On 7 April, a Japanese surface force was located, and strikes were launched to intercept the enemy, resulting in the sinking of . During these operations, the aircraft carrier was hit by a kamikaze and the destroyer rescued 23 survivors in a heroic rescue mission. For the remainder of the war, John W. Weeks participated in the final assault on the Empire Islands, engaging in radar picket duty, shore bombardment, rescue missions and the antishipping sweep off Tokyo Bay. Following the cessation of hostilities, she steamed into Tokyo Bay on 8 September to begin escort operations with the occupation forces. She continued escort duty until 30 December, when she sailed for home, arriving San Francisco on 20 January 1946. The destroyer arrived Norfolk, Virginia on 19 February and following repairs she was inactivated on 26 April. One year later, on 17 May 1947, she sailed once again and commenced Naval Reserve training cruises until mid-1949. On 6 September of that year, she sailed for Europe, returning on 8 February 1950. John W. Weeks decommissioned on 31 May 1950. =1950s= At the beginning of the Korean War, President Harry S. Truman ordered American forces into action to take up the challenge. John W. Weeks recommissioned on 24 October 1950 and commenced training cruises in the Atlantic and Caribbean. During her European cruise in January 1952, she participated in the attempt to save ill-fated , which foundered and sank in a gale on 10 January 1952. The destroyer returned to Norfolk on 6 February to engage in coastal operations and a midshipmen European cruise. John W. Weeks sailed on an around the world cruise on 3 November 1953, and while in the Far East she operated with units of the 7th Fleet off the coast of Korea. She completed the cruise when she returned via the Mediterranean arriving Norfolk on 4 June 1954. From 1954 to 1963 the destroyer operated with the Atlantic Fleet and during this period made five Mediterranean cruises and two NATO exercises. The destroyer was operating with the 6th Fleet during 1956 when the Suez crisis erupted over the canal. One year later, on another Near Eastern deployment, Weeks and other units stood by to prevent subversion of Jordan. The Mediterranean cruise of 1958 included patrol duty and exercises with navies of Baghdad Pact countries. The destroyer was also active in U.S. waters, busy with midshipmen at-sea training and antisubmarine exercises. During 1959 she participated in Operation \\"Inland Seas\\" during the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway. John W. Weeks was the first navy destroyer to enter each of the Great Lakes. During this cruise she escorted the royal yacht , with Queen Elizabeth II of England aboard, from Chicago to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. =1960s= On 9 March 1960, John W. Weeks, in company with the destroyer , transited the Bosporus; and the two became the first U.S. warships to enter the Black Sea since 1945. On the same cruise she rendezvoused with at the end of the nuclear-powered submarine's cruise round the world. After returning to Norfolk, the destroyer visited the Caribbean and the New England coast on midshipman training at sea. In the fall she deployed to the Mediterranean and returned to Norfolk, Virginia on 3 March 1962. Midshipman training in the summer and exercise out of Norfolk kept the ship in fighting trim and ready for action. In October, the presence of Soviet offensive missiles in Cuba prompted President John F. Kennedy to order a quarantine of the island (See Cuban Missile Crisis). John W. Weeks escorted replenishment ships to the quarantine area. When this display of national strength and determination forced the Kremlin to withdraw the missiles, John W. Weeks returned via San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Norfolk. Early in 1963, while preparing for another Mediterranean deployment from February‚ÄìApril, the destroyer received the Battle Efficiency \\"E\\" for outstanding service. She headed for the Mediterranean on 29 November. The end of the year found her patrolling off troubled Cyprus, standing by ready to evacuate, if necessary, Americans from that strife-torn island. On New Year's Day, en route to the Red Sea to join that U.S. Middle East Force, she was the first ship to transit the Suez Canal during 1964. She visited Jidda, Saudi Arabia; Berbera, Somali Republic, Aden, Aden Protectorate; Djibouti, French Somaliland; Massawa, Ethiopia; and Karachi, Pakistan. She headed west from Karachi on 6 February; refueled at Aden; then turned south for patrol along the Zanzibar coast during the revolution there, and off Kenya and Tanganyika during unrest in those countries. She departed Mombasa, Kenya on 24 February and transited the Suez Canal on 6 March. After patrolling the Mediterranean, John W. Weeks departed Pollenca Bay, Majorca, for home on 12 May and reached Norfolk on 23 May. After overhaul in Norfolk Naval Shipyard, the destroyer departed Hampton Roads on 9 November for Guantanamo Bay and refresher training. She returned to Norfolk early in January 1965 to prepare for another Mediterranean cruise. She got underway 13 February and arrived Valencia, Spain on 5 March. She stopped at Naples for a fortnight en route to the Suez Canal and 2 months of duty in the Red Sea. Back in the Mediterranean 2 June, the destroyer headed for home 30 June and returned to Norfolk 12 July. Late in the summer, the destroyer was on the Gemini 5 recovery team. For the remainder of the year, she operated out of Norfolk in the Caribbean and along the Atlantic Coast. She continued ASW exercises in the Caribbean until returning to Norfolk on 3 February 1966. After serving as sonar school ship at Key West during March and April, the veteran destroyer departed Norfolk 16 May for European waters. Steaming with DesRon 2, John W. Weeks spent the next 3 months cruising the western coast of Europe from Norway to France. She took part in anti- submarine warfare (ASW) exercises, and during Operation \\"Straight Laced,\\" a simulated invasion of the Norwegian coast, she operated with British and West German ships. While carrying out ASW duty during this exercise, she made the only simulated submarine kill in the operation on 19 August. Departing Derry, Northern Ireland on 24 August, she returned to Norfolk on 2 September. During the remainder of the year she served as school ship at Key West and joined in ASW exercises along the Atlantic Coast and in the Caribbean. John W. Weeks continued this duty until early in July 1967 when she departed Norfolk for deployment in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Steaming via San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Recife, Brazil, she touched at African ports on the east and west coasts of that continent and ranged Africa from the Gulf of Guinea to the Red Sea. The destroyer departed from Norfolk, Virginia in January 1969 for duty off the coast of Vietnam. She operated with four aircraft carriers while there. She returned home in September 1969. Decommissioning and disposal She was decommissioned and stricken on 12 August 1970, and finished her service as a gunnery target. She was sunk in the Atlantic Ocean off Virginia on 19 November 1970. Her final resting place is 1300 fathoms (7,800 feet; 2,377 meters) down, at . Awards John W. Weeks received four battle stars for World War II service.

In biblical scholarship he discussed the date of publication and the form and manner of the composition of the four canonical gospel accounts. Life He was the son of William Owen, born at his father's home near Cadair Idris, and educated at Ruthin School. He entered Jesus College, Oxford, in 1736. There took his degrees in arts (B.A. 1739, M.A.1743), while also devoting himself to mathematical studies, before concentrating on medical studies (M.B. 1746, M.D. 1753). Ordained to the Anglican Church in 1746, Owen practised medicine for three years while a curate in Gloucestershire to Theophilus Leigh, at Broadwell with Adlestrop. Advancement came, through Ralph Thoresby (1698‚Äì1763), son of Ralph Thoresby the antiquarian and rector of Stoke Newington, to whom he acted as curate, and Matthew Fetherstonhaugh, who presented him in 1752 to the living of Terling in Essex. He gave up Terling in 1760, when presented to the London parish St Olave Hart Street. From 1775 he also held the living of Edmonton, Middlesex, through Shute Barrington, bishop of Llandaff, whose chaplain he had become. From 1769 to 1771 Owen was Boyle Lecturer. He died on 14 October 1795 at Edmonton. Works Owen's major work was Observations on the Four Gospels, tending chiefly to ascertain the time of their Publication, and to illustrate the form and manner of their Composition (1764). The \\"Griesbach hypothesis\\" of Johann Jakob Griesbach, a form of two- gospel hypothesis, has been attributed to Owen. Among Owen's other publications are: * Harmonia Trigonometrica, or A short treatise on Trigonometry (1748); * The Intent and Propriety of the Scripture Miracles considered and explained (1755); * An Enquiry into the present State of the Septuagint Version of the Old Testament (1769); * Critica Sacra, or a short Introduction to Hebrew Criticism (1774); he replied, in a Supplement to this work, to comments on the Critic Sacra made by Raphael Baruch or Baruh in Critica Sacra Examined (1775). Baruh was a Sephardic immigrant in Britain from Livorno. * Collatio codicis Cottoniani Geneseos cum editione Romana a Joanne Ernesto Grabe jam olim facta nunc demum summa cura edita ab Henrico Owen, M.D. (1778); * A brief Account, historical and critical, of the Septuagint Version of the Old Testament, to which is added a Dissertation on the comparative Excellency of the Hebrew and Samaritan Pentateuch (1787); * The Modes of Quotation used by the Evangelical Writers, explained and vindicated (1789). Owen also helped to complete a number of works by William Bowyer, who published works of Owen: the two were on close terms. Family In 1760 Owen married Mary Butts, daughter of Robert Butts, bishop of Norwich. They had a son, Henry Butts Owen, who took over from his father as vicar of St Olave Hart Street in 1794, and five daughters.

The rebellion began in 1794, when large groups of rebels claiming White Lotus affiliations rose up within the mountainous region that separated Sichuan province from Hubei and Shaanxi provinces. A smaller precursor to the main rebellion broke out in 1774, under the leadership of the martial-arts and herbal-healing expert Wang Lun in Shandong province of northern China. Although the rebellion was finally crushed by the Qing government in 1804, it marked a turning point in the history of the Qing dynasty. Qing control weakened and prosperity diminished by the 19th century. The rebellion is estimated to have caused the deaths of some 100,000 rebels.https://www.scribd.com/doc/37359117/Bodycount- Final The White Lotus Society The White Lotus Rebellion was initiated as an antitax protest led by the White Lotus Society, a secret religious society. The White Lotus Society is traditionally considered to have first appeared during the 14th century under the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty. The Red Turban Rebellion which took place in 1352, was led by the White Lotus group. By 1387, after more than 30 years of war, their leader, Zhu Yuanzhang conquered the North China Plain and occupied the Yuan capital Khanbaliq (present-day Beijing). Having attained the Mandate of Heaven and the status of Emperor, Zhu Yuanzhang named his period of reign \\"Hongwu\\" (thus he was known as the Hongwu Emperor) and founded a new dynasty ‚Äì the Ming dynasty. The group later reemerged in the late 18th century in the form of an inspired Chinese movement.Yingcong Dai, The White Lotus War: Rebellion and Suppression in Late Imperial China (U of Washington Press, 2019) Though many movements and rebellions were considered by imperial bureaucrats to have been led by White Lotus Society leaders, there is reason to doubt that the White Lotus Society had any organizational unity. BJ Ter Haar has argued that the term \\"White Lotus\\" was used primarily by Ming and Qing imperial bureaucrats to disparagingly explain a wide range of unconnected millenarian traditions, rebel movements, and popular religious practices. According to Ter Haar, it is clear that the \\"White Lotus\\" rebels of the uprisings that occurred between 1796 and 1804 did not voluntarily use the term \\"White Lotus\\" to refer to themselves or their movement. The term was only used by the millenarian rebels under intense pressure during government interrogations. It is only as historical sources look back upon these events do they began to summarize the various aspects of these uprisings as the \\"White Lotus rebellion.\\" HistoryWang Lun Uprising= In 1774, one instance of a derivative sect of the White Lotus, the Eight Trigrams arose in the form of underground meditation teachings and practice in Shandong province, not far from Beijing near the city of Linqing. The leader, herbalist and martial artist Wang Lun, led an uprising that captured three small cities and laid siege to the larger city of Linqing, a strategic location on the north-south Grand Canal transportation route. Wang Lun likely failed because he did not make any attempts to raise wide public support. He did not distribute captured wealth or food supplies, nor did he promise to lessen the tax burden. Unable to build up a support base, he was forced to quickly flee all three cities that he attacked in order to evade government troops. Though he passed through an area inhabited by almost a million peasants, his army never measured more than 4,000 soldiers, many of whom had been forced into service. =White Lotus Rebellion= In 1794, a similar movement arose in the mountainous region that separated Sichuan province from Hubei and Shaanxi provinces in central China, initially as a tax protest. The White Lotus led impoverished settlers into rebellion, promising personal salvation in return for their loyalty. Beginning as tax protests, the eventual rebellion gained growing support and sympathy from many ordinary people. The rebellion grew in number and power and eventually, into a serious concern for the government. =Suppression= The Qianlong Emperor (r. 1735‚Äì96) sent Helin and Fuk'anggan to quell the uprising. Surprisingly, the ill-organized rebels managed to defeat the inadequate and inefficient Qing imperial forces. After both died in battle in 1796, the Qing government sent new officials, but none were successful. Only after 1800 did the Qing government adopt new tactics that established local militias (tuan) to help surround and destroy the White Lotus. The Qianlong emperor ordered that Eight Banner armies, whether Manchu or Han banners were not to be used against internal uprisings so the Qing relied mainly on the Han Chinese Green Standard Army and Han militias to suppress rebellions such as the White Lotus. The Qing commanders sent to repress the rebellion had a difficult time putting down the White Lotus. The White Lotus bands mainly used guerrilla tactics, and once they disbanded were virtually indistinguishable from the local population. As one Qing official complained: > The rebels are all our own subjects. They are not like some external tribe > ... that can be demarcated by a territorial boundary and identified by its > distinctive clothing and language ... When they congregate and oppose the > government, they are rebels; when they disperse and depart, they are > civilians once more. Without any clear enemy to fight, brutality against civilians became more common. Because of the brutality of the Qing troops, however, the troops were soon nicknamed the \\"Red Lotus\\" Society. A systematic program of pacification followed: resettling the populace in hundreds of stockaded villages and organizing them into militias. In its last stage, the Qing suppression policy combined pursuit and extermination of rebel guerrilla bands with a program of amnesty for deserters. The imperial authorities suppressed the White Lotus Rebellion in 1805 using a combination of military and social policies. Approximately 7,000 Banner troops were sent in from Manchuria in combination with Green Standard Army soldiers from Guizhou and Yunnan as well as tens of thousands of local mercenaries. A decree from the Daoguang Emperor admitted, \\"it was extortion by local officials that goaded the people into rebellion...\\" Using the arrest of sectarian members as a threat, local officials and police extorted money from people. Actual participation in sect activities had no impact on an arrest; whether or not monetary demands were met, however, did. Administrators also seized and destroyed sectarian scriptures used by the religious groups. One such official was Huang Yupian (), who refuted the ideas found in the scriptures with orthodox Confucian and Buddhist views in A Detailed Refutation of Heresy ( P≈çxi√© Xi√°ngbi√†n), which was written in 1838. This book has since become an invaluable source in understanding the beliefs of these groups. The end of the White Lotus Rebellion in 1804 also brought an end to the myth of the military invincibility of the Manchus, perhaps contributing to the greater frequency of rebellions in the 19th century. The White Lotus continued to be active, and might have influenced the next major domestic rebellion, the Eight Trigrams Uprising of 1813. Throughout the 1820s and 1830s, the area of the boundary between Henan and Anhui was perpetually plagued by White Lotus revolts, frequently in league with the area's brigands and salt smugglers. Other White Lotus spinoffs include the Eight Trigrams, the Tiger Whips, and the Yihequan (Boxers).  Legacy  Forty-eight years later, Zeng Guofan studied and was inspired by the Qing government's methods during the White Lotus Rebellion while considering ways to suppress the Taiping Rebellion.

It is part of the larger Tainui confederation of Polynesian settlers who arrived to New Zealand on the Tainui waka (migration canoe). The tribe is named after the Waikato River, which plays a large part in its history and culture. P≈çtatau Te Wherowhero, the first MƒÅori king, was a member of the Waikato hapu (sub-tribe) of NgƒÅti Mahuta, and his descendants have succeeded him. The king movement is based at Turangawaewae marae (meeting place) in NgƒÅruawƒÅhia. The Waikato-Tainui iwi comprises 33 hapu (sub-tribes) and 65 marae (family groupings). There are over 52,000 tribal members who affiliate to Waikato-Tainui. Hamilton City is now the tribe's largest population centre, but NgƒÅruawƒÅhia remains the tribe's historical centre and modern capital. In the 2006 census, 33,429 people in New Zealand indicated they were affiliated with Waikato, including those affiliated with more than one tribe. This is how the iwi describes its origins and tribal area:  Government  Waikato-Tainui's governing parliamentary body is Te Kauhanganui, a governing body of 204 tribal members ‚Äì 3 members from each of the 68 marae. The marae are spread over a large area from Te Kuiti and Cambridge in the south to Auckland in the north. The executive board is Te Arataura, which has 10 representatives elected from Te Kauhanganui and an 11th member appointed by the MƒÅori king. The Waikato-Tainui tribal administration (or iwi authority) is the Waikato Raupatu Trustee Company Ltd, which replaced the Tainui MƒÅori Trust Board, and is situated at Hopuhopu, NgƒÅruawƒÅhia. The Waikato iwi has been using the name Tainui to describe itself for some time, through the establishment of the Tainui MƒÅori Trust Board by the Waikato-Maniapoto Maori Claims Settlement Act 1946, with many people now referring to the Waikato iwi as \\"Tainui\\" or \\"Waikato-Tainui\\". There have traditionally been strong links between Tainui and the University of Waikato, which has strengths in MƒÅori language and modern local history. The university also holds documents and objects related to the tribe. Hap≈´ and marae Waikato Tainui is made up of several iwi (tribes) and hap≈´ (sub-tribes).

Clean water is scarce. Diseases caused by poor hygiene are prevalent. A great majority living in the slum lack access to basic services, including electricity, running water, and medical care. The Government initiated a clearance programme to replace the slum with a residential district of high-rise apartments, and to relocate the residents to these new buildings upon completion. The neighbourhood is divided into a number of villages, including Kianda, Soweto East, Gatwekera, Kisumu Ndogo, Lindi, Laini Saba, Siranga, Makina, Salama, Ayany and Mashimoni. History Kibera slum in Nairobi, Kenya, in 2005. It is the largest slum in Africa and the third largest in the world. =Colonial era= The city of Nairobi, where Kibera is located, was founded in 1899 when the Uganda Railway line was built, thereby creating a need for its headquarters and British colonial offices.Gatabaki- Kamau, R., & Karirah-Gitau, S.

Uppsala: Nordic Africa InstituteBrian Ekdale, in A Companion to Media Authorship, (Editors: Jonathan Gray, Derek Johnson), , pages 158‚Äì180 The colonial administration intended to keep Nairobi as a home for Europeans and temporary migrant workers from Africa and Asia. The migrant workers were brought into Nairobi on short- term contracts, as indentured labor, to work in the service sector, as railway manual labour and to fill lower-level administrative posts in the colonial government.Furedi, F.

British Medical Journal, 1(4697), 67 Permits to live in Nairobi were necessary, and these permits separated living areas of non-Europeans by ethnic group. One such group were African soldiers who served the military interests of the British colonial army, and their assigned area developed into a slum, now known as Kibera.Mitullah, W. V., & Kibwana, K.

The American Historical Review, 116(4), 987‚Äì1013Boomtown slum ‚Äì A day in the economic life of Africa's biggest shanty-town The Economist (22 December 2012) Kibera originated as a settlement in the forests at the outskirts of Nairobi, when Nubian soldiers returning from service with the King's African Rifles (KAR) were allocated plots of land there in return for their efforts in 1904. Kibera was situated on the KAR military exercise grounds in close proximity to the KAR headquarters along Thika Road. The British colonial government allowed the settlement to grow informally. The Nubians had no claim on land in \\"Native Reserves\\" and over time, other tribes moved into the area to rent land from the Nubian landlords. With the increase in railway traffic, Nairobi's economy developed, and an increasing number of rural migrants moved to urban Nairobi in search of wage labour. Kibera and other slums developed throughout Nairobi.Obudho, R. A., & Aduwo, G. O. (1989). Slum and squatter settlements in urban centres of Kenya: Towards a planning strategy. Journal of Housing and the Built Environment, 4(1), 17‚Äì30 Kibera slum was established in early 20th century, and has grown ever since on public lands, around water streams and railway tracks. Its current residents are people from all major ethnic groups of Kenya. Proposals were made in the late 1920s to demolish and relocate Kibera, as it was within the zone of European residential holdings; however, the residents objected to these proposals. The colonial government considered proposals to reorganize Kibera, and the Kenya Land Commission heard a number of cases which referred to the \\"Kibera problem\\".Parsons, Timothy (1997), Kibra Is Our Blood: The Sudanese Military Legacy in Nairobi's Kibera Location , 1902‚Äì1968. The International Journal of African Historical Studies, 30(1), 87‚Äì122 By then, Kibera was not the only slum. A 1931 Colonial Report noted the segregated nature of housing in Nairobi and other Kenyan towns, with housing for Europeans reported as good, and widespread prevalence of slum property for Africans and other non-European migrants.Colonial Reports, Annual No. 1606 Kenya Colony and Protectorate (1931), His Majesty's Stationery Office, London; page 17-20 =Post- independence= After Kenya became independent in 1963, a number of forms of housing were made illegal by the government. The new ruling affected Kibera on the basis of land tenure, rendering it an unauthorized settlement. Despite this, people continued to live there, and by the early 1970s landlords were renting out their properties in Kibera to significantly greater numbers of tenants than were permitted by law. The tenants, who are highly impoverished, cannot afford to rent legal housing, finding the rates offered in Kibera to be comparatively affordable. The number of residents in Kibera has increased accordingly despite its unauthorized nature. By 1974, members of the Kikuyu tribe predominated the population of Kibera, and had gained control over administrative positions, which were kept through political patronage. A shift in Kenyan demographics has taken place since then, with the Luo and Luhya tribes from the West of Kenya being the primary sources of internal emigration. By 1995 Kibera had become a predominantly Luo slum and Mathare Valley nearby the predominantly Kikuyu slum area. The coincident rise of multi party politics in Kenya has caused the Luo leader and MP for much of Kibera, the parliamentary seat of Langata, Raila Odinga to be known for his ability to bring out a formidable demonstration force instantly. Meanwhile, Mathare Valley has become a hotbed of gang warfare. Political tensions in the nation between the ethnic tribes escalated after the re-election of President Kibaki in 2007. The relative location of Kibera in Nairobi The Nubian community has a Council of Elders who are also the Trustees of its Trust. This Trust now claims all of Kibera. It claims that the extent of their land is over . It claims that owing to State sanctioned allotments the land area is now reduced to . The Government does not accept their claims but its rehousing program envisions a land extent around for the claimed Nubian settlement. Neither side has left any room for negotiation from this position. Presently, Kibera's residents represent all the major Kenyan ethnic backgrounds, with some areas being specifically dominated by peoples of one ethno-linguistic group. Many new residents come from rural areas with chronic underdevelopment and overpopulation issues. The multi-ethnic nature of Kibera's populism combined with the tribalism that pervades Kenyan politics has led to Kibera hosting a number of small ethnic conflicts throughout its century-long history. The Kenyan government owns all the land upon which Kibera stands, though it continues to not officially acknowledge the settlement; no basic services, schools, clinics, running water or lavatories are publicly provided, and the services that do exist are privately owned. Geography Kibera is in southwest Nairobi, from the city centre. Much of its southern border is bounded by the Nairobi river and the Nairobi Dam, an artificial lake that used to provide drinking water to the residents of the city, but now there are two main pipes going into Kibera. Kibera is divided into thirteen villages and two estates, including Kianda, Soweto East, Gatwekera, Kisumu Ndogo, Lindi, Laini Saba, Siranga, Makina, Salama, Ayany and Mashimoni. = Built environment = Kibera‚Äôs morphology is very dynamic. Between 2006 and 2014 a spatiotemporal change of single buildings and building blocks across the areas of Lindi, Mashimoni, Laina Saba and Soweto East was measured (77% rise in number of buildings, density increase by 10%). Yet, its organic structure and pattern (building blocks, pathways), generally remained unchanged. Demographics The population density in the Kianda village in western Kibera The 2009 Kenya Population and Housing Census reported Kibera's population as 170,070. The Kibera slum was previously thought to be one of the biggest informal urban settlements in the world. Several actors had provided and published over the years growing estimations of the size of its population, most of them stating that it was the largest slum in Africa with the number of people there reaching over 1 million. According to Mike Davis, a well known expert on urban slums, Kibera had a population of about 800,000 people.M.Davis, (2006) The Planet of Slums The International Housing Coalition (IHC) made an estimate of more than half a million people.http://www.intlhc.org/docs/urban- investment.pdf UN-Habitat had released several estimations ranging between 350,000 and 1 million people. These statistics mainly come out of analysis of aerial pictures of the area. IRIN estimated a population density of 2000 residents per hectare. In 2008 an independent team of researchers began a door-by-door survey named \\"Map Kibera Project\\"http://mapkiberaproject.yolasite.com with the aim to map physical and socio-demographic features of the slum. A trained team of locals, after having developed an ad-hoc surveying methodology, has so far gathered census data of over 15,000 people and completed the mapping of 5000 structures, services (public toilets, schools), and infrastructures (drainage system, water and electricity supply) in the village of Kianda. On the basis of data collected in Kianda, the Map Kibera Project team estimated that the whole Kibera slum could be inhabited by a total population ranging from 235,000 to a maximum of 270,000 people, dramatically scaling down all previous figures.Marras, S. (2012) \\"GIS, web, and 3D. Tools for holistic and shareable knowledge. The experience of the Map Kibera Project.\\" in Territorio, n.61: 110‚Äì114Marras, S. (2010) \\"Map Kibera Project. Risultati e analisi dalla prima mappatura indipendente della baraccopoli di Kibera.\\" in Lotus, n.143: 32‚Äì33 The breakdown of ethnic groups inhabiting Kibera and their gender-specific representation is Luo: 34.9% (male), 35.4% (female); Luyia: 26.5% (male), 32.5% (female); Nubian: 11.6% (male), 9.1% (female); Kikuyu: 7.9% (male), 6.4% (female); Kamba: 7.5% (male), 10.3% (female); Kisii: 6.4% (male), 2.2% (female); Other: 5.2% (male), 4.1% (female) Railway Tracks in Kibera, Nairobi, Kenya. The Uganda Railway line linking Mombasa, Nairobi and Kisumu on Lake Victoria began about 1901 under the British colonial empire. In the early 20th century, the British government gave Kenyan soldiers in its regional army the right to live on public land near the railway tracks, leading to the creation of Kibera.Parsons, T. (1997). \\" Kibra Is Our Blood\\": The Sudanese Military Legacy in Nairobi's Kibera Location, 1902‚Äì1968. The International Journal of African Historical Studies, 30(1), pp. 87‚Äì122.Smedt, J. V. A. D. (2011). The Nubis of Kibera: a social history of the Nubians and Kibera slums (Doctoral dissertation, Faculty of the Humanities, Leiden University) Infrastructure The Uganda Railway Line passes through the centre of the neighbourhood, providing passengers aboard the train a firsthand view of the slum. Kibera has a railway station, but most residents use buses and matatus to reach the city centre; carjacking, irresponsible driving, and poor traffic law enforcement are chronic issues. Kibera is heavily polluted by human refuse, garbage, soot, dust, and other wastes. The slum is contaminated with human and animal faeces, due to the open sewage system and the frequent use of \\"flying toilets\\". The lack of sanitation combined with poor nutrition among residents accounts for many illnesses and diseases. The Umande Trust, a local NGO, is building communal toilets that generate methane gas (biogas) for local residents. A community radio station, Pamoja FM, advocates not only upgrading Kibera slum but also all the slums in Nairobi. Kibera Journal has existed since November 2006. The paper covers issues affecting the people of Kibera, and it has played an important role in training the youth in basic journalism skills that they use to cover issues in their communities. Education Most education centres in Kibera are classified as informal, but various initiatives have been underway to add schools.Slum dwellers' response to free primary education: a case study of Kibera slum, Nairobi Caroline Njeru, University of Nairobi (2010) Some start as babycare centres, which later develop into schools. Most are not regulated by the government. Some of the notable schools are Olympic Primary School, one of the leading government schools in the country. Other government (public) schools in Kibera include Kibera Primary School (also called Old Kibera), Ayany Primary School and Toi Primary School. Facing the Future School (FaFu), as well as several church-owned and privately owned schools are also in the area. Notable Secondary schools include PCEA Silanga High School, owned by the Presbyterian Church of East Africa, Raila Educational centre, and Olympic secondary School among others. There is the vocational PCEA Emmanuel Technical Training Centre, offering self-employment skills to the residents and the Tunapanda Institute, offering free courses on technology, design and business skills. Several other local youth organisations, like the football (soccer) team the Kibera Black stars, are also concerned and involved in educational projects. Slum upgrading The ground in much of Kibera is composed of refuse and rubbish. Kibera is one of the most studied slums in Africa, not only because it sits in the centre of the modern city, but also because UN-HABITAT, the United Nations' agency for human settlements, is headquartered close by. Ban Ki-moon visited the settlement within a month of his selection as UN secretary-general. Kibera, as one of the most pronounced slums within Kenya, is undergoing an intensive slum upgrading process. The government, UN-HABITAT and a contingent of NGOs, notably Maji na Ufanisi, are making inroads into the settlements in an attempt to facelift the housing and sanitary conditions. There are three significant complicating factors to construction or upgrade within Kibera. The first is the rate of petty and serious crime. Building materials cannot be left unattended for long at any time because there is a very high chance of them being stolen. It is not uncommon for owners of storm-damaged dwellings to have to camp on top of the remnants of their homes until repairs can be made, to protect the raw materials from would-be thieves. The second is the lack of building foundations. The ground in much of Kibera is literally composed of refuse and rubbish. Dwellings are often constructed atop this unstable ground, and therefore many structures collapse whenever the slum experiences flooding, which it does regularly. This means that even well-constructed buildings are often damaged by the collapse of nearby poorly constructed ones. The third complicating factor is the unyielding topography and cramped sprawl of the area. Few houses have vehicle access, and many are at the bottoms of steep inclines (which heightens the flooding risk). This means that any construction efforts are made more difficult and costly by the fact that all materials must be brought in by hand. =Clearance= New apartments being built adjacent to Kibera On 16 September 2009 the Kenyan government, which claims ownership of the land on which Kibera stands, began a long-term movement scheme which will rehouse the people who live in slums in Nairobi. The clearance of Kibera was expected to take between two and five years to complete. The entire project was planned to take nine years and to rehouse all the slum residents in the city. The project had the backing of the United Nations and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga, who was the area MP, and was expected to cost $1.2 billion. The new communities were planned to include schools, markets, playgrounds and other facilities. The first batch of around 1,500 people to leave the slum were taken away by truck on 16 September 2009 from 6:30 am local time and were rehoused in 300 newly constructed apartments with a monthly rent of around $10. The project start was postponed several times when Prime Minister Odinga was unavailable to oversee the first day. He was joined on the first day by Housing Minister Soita Shitanda and his assistant Margaret Wanjiru, with all three helping residents to load their belongings onto the trucks. Also present were several dozen armed police officers to oversee the arrangements and to deter any resistance. The process has been legally challenged by more than 80 people, and the Kenyan High Court has stated that the government cannot begin demolition works until the case is heard in October but will be able to demolish the homes of people who leave voluntarily before then. The 80 plaintiffs are a mixture of middle-class landlords and Kibera residents, and they claim that the land in Kibera is theirs and hence the government has no right to demolish the shacks. The Nubian community, who have lived on the land for nearly 100 years, are also disappointed with the scheme, and one elder has said that the present housing should be improved instead. The project has also come under fire from urban planners who say that it risks repeating the mistakes of previous schemes, when poor families either shared two-room apartments with one or two other families to pay the rent, or sublet them to middle-class families and moved back into the slums. Workers earning a minimum wage in Kenya make less than US$2 per day. There is also controversy over the timing of the project, with the first phase, rehousing 7,500 people, being delayed by five years and one government official stating that if the project continues at the current pace it will take 1,178 years to complete.

It is mentioned in the music video \\"World on Fire\\" by Sarah McLachlan, which profiled the work of Carolina for Kibera, a grassroots organization named a Hero of Global Health in 2005 by Time magazine. Robert Neuwirth devotes a chapter of his book Shadow Cities to Kibera and calls it a squatter community, predicting that places like Kibera, Sultanbeyli in Istanbul, Turkey, and Dharavi in Mumbai, India, are the prototypes of the cities of tomorrow. Among other things, Neuwirth points out that such cities should be reconsidered and not viewed merely as slums, because many locals were drawn to them while escaping far worse conditions in rural areas. Michael Holman's 2005 novel Last Orders at Harrods is based on a fictional version of the slum, called Kireba. Bill Bryson visited Africa for CARE and wrote a companion book called \\"Bill Bryson's African Diary\\", which includes a description of his visit to Kibera. Kibera is the backdrop for the award-winning short film Kibera Kid, which featured a cast entirely drawn from residents. It has played in film festivals worldwide including the Berlin Film Festival and won a Student Emmy from Hollywood. Recently, Hot Sun Foundation and Hot Sun Films started the first film school in the slum, the Kibera Film School. The school teaches the youth from the slum how to make films and tell their stories. In 2009 through 2010, the Kibera Film School and Hot Sun Foundation collaborated on the feature follow-up to Kibera Kid, which is titled Togetherness Supreme. In his documentary Living with Corruption, Sorious Samura stayed with a family in Kibera to film the corruption that occurs even at the lowest levels of Kenyan society. Furthermore, Kibera is portrayed in the Austrian 2007 documentary √úber Wasser: Menschen und gelbe Kanister. In 2011, the BBC aired a reality show documentary TV program called Rich, Famous and in the Slums about Kibera. The program showed four famous and rich people, after working at the worst jobs available in the slums, moving in with four local impoverished families and getting to meet the actual conditions in which they live. They were: * A single mother away from her two children, supporting them and her parents through prostitution. * A family of young orphans living in horrible conditions. * A single mother of 6, with HIV, who owned a small beauty salon and volunteers as a community health care person. * A 20 year old newcomer to Kibera, one of many pouring in from other parts of Kenya hoping to find a job in Nairobi. The Economist published an article in 2012 suggesting that Kibera \\"may be the most entrepreneurial place on the planet\\" and that \\"to equate slums with idleness and misery is to misunderstand them\\". The 2014 novel Bingo's Run by James A. Levine features a 15-year-old from Kibera.

Contents of the program The program is co-ordinated by the Ministry of Social Development and Hunger Combat (Minist√©rio do Desenvolvimento Social e Combate √† Fome) and was intended to put into action the government's strategy to guarantee the right of access to basic food. The program takes a number of forms, ranging from direct financial aid to the poorest families (with the Bolsa Fam√≠lia card) to diverse strategies such as creating water cisterns in Brazil's semi- arid areas, creating low-cost restaurants, educating people about healthy eating habits, distributing vitamins and iron supplements, supporting subsistence family farming and giving access to microcredit. Fome Zero is thought to be the biggest initiative to date by a Brazilian government to combat hunger in the history of the country, and builds on similar assistance programs implemented by previous governments. Effects The program is believed to have contributed to Brazil's recent reported improvements in its fight against poverty, according to research promoted by some universities and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).

He also criticised the mechanisms for money donation and food gathering and distribution. Fome Zero is considered by the opposition (especially the PSDB and DEM parties) as a failure, due to what they believe is the government's inability to manage the program effectively. Murilo Zauith, a PFL federal deputy, in March 2005, said the program was faulty, citing as an example the death of several indigenous children due to malnutrition in the city of Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul. However, Humberto Costa, the Minister of Health at the time, considered the death count average and not alarming.Murilo Zauith considera Fome Zero programa fracassado - Correio do Estado (March 11, 2005) Another criticism is that the program turned mostly in a money-transfer program, subject to corruption, and did not completely solve the problem.The Fome Zero Program ‚Äì Brazil‚Äôs Losing Struggle to Help the Hungry: Lula‚Äôs Leadership Fading - Council on Hemispheric Affairs(July, 2005) Data from 2014-2015 showed that malnutrition is still a problem in Brazil and responsible by 4.3 deaths per 100,000 people per year, linked to the fact that 3.8% of the population (7.6 million people) still earns less than US$1 a day.Malnutrition Death Rate Per 100,000 - WORLD HEALTH RANKINGS(Who, 2014)Nutrition Landscape Information System (NLiS) - World Health Organization(March, 2017)  Sources  * Aaron Ansell, Zero Hunger: Political Culture and Antipoverty Policy in Northeast Brazil (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2014) See also *Bolsa Escola *Bolsa Fam√≠lia ReferencesExternal links * Fome Zero Official Website Category:Welfare in Brazil Category:Social security in Brazil ","title":"Fome Zero"},{"id":"2728224","text":"Kay Hammond & Roland Culver in the original Criterion Theatre production, 1936 French Without Tears is a comic play written by a 25-year-old Terence Rattigan in 1936.

It is mined for both potassium and magnesium and occurs in the evaporite deposits of Carlsbad, New Mexico; the Paradox Basin in Colorado and Utah; Stassfurt, Germany; the Perm Basin, Russia; and the Williston Basin in Saskatchewan, Canada. These deposits date from the Devonian through the Permian Periods. In contrast, both Israel and Jordan produce potash from the Dead Sea by using evaporation pans to further concentrate the brine until carnallite precipitates, dredging the carnallite from the pans, and processing to remove the magnesium chloride from the potassium chloride. Carnallite was first described in 1856 from its type location of Stassfurt Deposit, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. It was named for the Prussian mining engineer Rudolf von Carnall (1804‚Äì1874). Carnallite from Russia Background Information Halides are binary compounds. They are composed of a halogen and a metal ion. The crystal chemistry of halides is characterized by the electronegativity of halogen ions.Bragg, L., and G. F. Claringbull. (1965) Crystal Structure of minerals. G. Bell and Sons, Ltd., London. This means that the dominant large ions are the Cl‚àí, Br‚àí, F‚àí, or I‚àí. These are easily polarized.Klein, Cornelis, B. Dutrow (2007) Manual of Mineral Science, 23rd ed.John Wiley and Sons The ions combine with similarly large but low valence and weakly polarized cations. The cations are mostly of the alkali metal group. Sylvite is a binary compound with the formula KCl. Sylvite precipitates first from mixed solutions of K+, Mg2+ and Cl‚àí, leaving a brine enriched in magnesium from which the mixed halide carnallite then precipitates. Composition Carnallite's chemical formula is KMgCl3¬∑6(H2O). Synthetic carnallite crystal specimens can be produced from 1.5 mole percent KCl and 98.5 mole percent MgCl2¬∑6H2O by slow crystallization at 25 ¬∞C.Schlemper, E. O., P. K. Gupta, and Tibor Zoltai. (1985) Refinement of the Structure of Carnallite, Mg(H2O)6KCL3. American Mineralogist 70,1309‚Äì1313. Its density is 1.602 g/cm3. Carnallite can also be produced by grinding the combination of hydrated magnesium chloride and potassium chloride.Shoval, S., S. Yariv. (1998) Formation of Carnallite Type Double Salts by Grinding Mixtures of Magnesium and Alkali Halides with the Same Anions. Journal of Thermal Analysis 51, 251‚Äì263 Structure Carnallite has corner- and face-sharing. There is a network of KCl6 octahedra, with two-thirds of them sharing faces. Mg(H2O)6 octahedra occupy the open spaces within the KCl octahedra. The interatomic distance between the Mg and the H2O ranges from 0.204 to 0.209 nm., with an average is 0.2045 nm. The interatomic distance between K and Cl ranges 0.317 to 0.331 nm., with an average of 0.324 nm. The resulting structure has a calculated density of 1.587 g/cm3, in good agreement with the measured value of 1.602 g/cm3. Face sharing creates more chance of instability, according to the third of Pauling's rules. In carnallite, the water molecules enclose the magnesium ions. This prevents the magnesium and the chloride from interacting directly; instead, the water molecules act as charge transmitters. The five chloride anions are each coordinated to two potassium cations as well as four water molecules. This means that each chloride anion receives 1/6 of a +1 charge from each of the two potassium ions. The chloride also obtains 1/6 of a +1 charge from each the four water molecules. The charges thus total six 1/6 positive charges, which balance the negative charge of the chloride. These two aspects render the rare face sharing described of the second and third of Pauling's rule acceptable in the carnallite structure. Physical properties Carnallite's refractive index ranges from 1.467 to 1.494.Mottana, Annibale, R. Crespi, and G. Liborio. (1978) Rocks and Minerals. Simon and Schuster. NY. Carnallite may be red as a result of hematite (Fe2O3) inclusions. The fragmented shards of iron oxide produce red tints in the thin laminae of hematite. Carnallite is also deliquescent in high humidity. This implies that it is also extremely soluble in water. Individual crystals are pseudo- hexagonal and tabular but are extremely rarely seen.Blatt, H. (1992) Sedimentary Petrology, 2nd ed. W.H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco. Field indicators of carnallite are environment of formation, absence of cleavage, and fracture. Other indicators can be density, taste, associations to local minerals, and whether it is capable of luminescence. Carnallite has a bitter taste. Carnallite may not only be fluorescent but is capable of being phosphorescent. The potassium that carnallite contains fuses easily within a flame, creating a violet color. Geologic occurrence Mineral associations based on some physical properties include, but not limited to, halite, anhydrite, dolomite, gypsum, kainite, kieserite, polyhalite, and sylvite.Anthony, J. W., R. A. Bideaux, R. A., Bladh, K. W. and M. C. Nichols. (1997) Handbook of Mineralogy. Vol. 3 Halides, hydroxides, oxides. Mineral Data Publications, Tucson, Arizona.Phosphate, potash, and sulfur- A special issue. (1979) Economic Geology 74, 191‚Äì493. Carnallite minerals are mineral sediments known as evaporites. Evaporites are concentrated by evaporation of seawater. The inflow of water must be below the evaporation or use levels. This creates a prolonged evaporation period. In controlled environment experiments, the halides form when 10%‚Äì20% of the original sample of water remains.Smetannikov, A. F., (2010) Hydrogen Generation during the Radiolysis of Crystallization water in Carnallite and Possible Consequences of this Process Geochemistry International 49, 971‚Äì980 Closer to 10 percent sylvite followed by Carnallite form. Carnallite is mostly found in saline marine deposits, although beds exist in the endorheic Qaidam Basin of China's Qinghai Province near Dabusun Nor.. Uses Carnallite is mostly used in fertilizers. It is an important source of potash. Only sylvite outranks carnallite's importance in potash production. Both are uncommon because they are some of the last evaporites to form. Soluble potassium salts are the main sources for fertilizer. This is because the potassium is difficult to separate from insoluble potassium feldspar. Carnallite is a minor source of magnesium worldwide; however, it is Russia's main source.

Monroe and starring Dennis Hopper and Kelly Brook. It premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on 20 May 2004. Nine strangers have been abducted and locked inside a house. A mysterious voice called The Watcher (voiced by Jim Carter) tells them that they are to play a game: the last person alive can leave the house and win five million dollars. The film is presented with \\"live feeds\\" from hidden surveillance cameras, showing the nine people turning from cooperative escape attempts to a killing fest. Plot The film opens up with surveillance camera views of a mansion and its rooms; the views alternate among images of nine people being kidnapped. Lea (Kelly Brook), an abductee, wakes up in a bedroom. She notices others in nearby bedrooms, and runs to the main door, bangs at it, and shouts to be let out. She finds the windows are all walled with bricks; even the basement door is blocked. She has a panic attack and passes out. Lea is awakened by Father Duffy (Dennis Hopper), a priest who is with a group of seven people. A voice (Jim Carter) comes over a speaker which announces they are gathered to play a game. Their friends and family are being \\"taken care of\\", so they won't be found. Also, they were chosen \\"not based on who they are, but what they are\\". It is like a reality show, only much graver: the rules are that the winner is the last one left alive; he or she would then be freed, and also receive compensation of five million U.S. dollars. The players discuss the situation. They try to break down the door using a dining table as a battering ram, and then try to dig and break through other holes, but nothing works. A sound from the kitchen reveals a dumbwaiter with food. In the dining room, the players introduce themselves. Father Duffy is a priest. Jay is a cop with a pistol. Lea is a dancer. Claire is a tennis player. Francis is a musician, and Cynthia is his wife. Al B is an ambitious rapper who covets Jay's gun, and assumes anything said about him is racially motivated. Shona is a drug addict with an ankle bracelet monitor; some players hope that this may attract outside help. Max Roy (Peter Capaldi) is a clothes designer. After dinner, the players choose bedrooms. Cynthia and Francis take one, and Duffy gets his own; the others share. Jay and Lea talk about their families, until someone sneaks in and tries to steal Jay's gun. Jay and Lea foil the attempt and assemble everyone in the hallway where they all argue. Afterwards, Jay tells Lea that he only trusts her and Duffy. The players open a wine cabinet and have drinks, except for Duffy, who returns to his room. Lea goes for a walk and Jay sits at his bed. Francis leaves with a glass stopper; he breaks it in the bathroom, and hides some shards under the toilet lid. Shona, Claire and Max get drunk. Al B flirts and dances with Cynthia, until Francis arrives. The two men fight, but when Cynthia intervenes, Al B pushes her and knocks the back of her head against the stone railing, which causes her death. Jay \\"arrests\\" Al B, and locks him in a room using a pipe. The players are shocked at Cynthia's death. Al B screams to be let out. Duffy brings him food, but he escapes and attacks Jay with the pipe; he beats him to a pulp. With his dying breath, Jay gives Duffy his gun. Al B slowly backs into the room and shuts the door. The next day, the six remaining players find food and wine, along with a card that says \\"Good work\\". They run to Al B's room and find that he has hanged himself. Duffy and Lea stand in shock, while the other players leave to eat. Francis retreats and show signs of a mental breakdown. Shona and Claire argue, and it escalates to the point where Claire kills Shona. Meanwhile, Francis goes after Lea, who is washing her face in the bathroom. He rips the light fixture from the wall and throws it into the sink, electrocuting her. Claire tells Duffy that she killed Shona in self-defense. Duffy leaves to look for Lea, and finds her on the bathroom floor. Francis arrives, and pretends to act surprised. Meanwhile, Claire goes to get food, but sees Max. She offers to form an alliance with him; he accepts. Francis attacks Duffy with the assumption he would not retaliate with the gun, but Duffy shoots him in the stomach. As Claire turns around to the sound, Max wraps his belt around her neck. Duffy returns to the foyer and sees Max strangle Claire. Max explains that \\"she was stealing food\\", but refuses Duffy's pleas to stop. Duffy shoots Max in the head. The gunshot awakens Lea, who had survived the electrocution. She barricades the door and rushes to the shower, but knocks the toilet lid and discovers the glass shards that Francis hid. She tears a shower curtain and wraps it around one of the shards. Duffy asks Claire if she is okay, but he is stabbed in the back by Francis, and he drops the gun. Francis retrieves it and shoots Claire. Duffy pleads for his life, but Francis uses the last round to shoot him. He then declares victory, repeatedly shouting \\"I Win!\\" Upstairs, Lea makes a commotion when she fumbles with the toilet cover. Francis hears the noise and heads upstairs. Lea hides under the bed when Francis walks in the room. After seeing that Lea is no longer in the bathroom, he spots her, and toys with her briefly before pulling her out. In the ensuing struggle, Lea stabs Francis in the leg with the shard, and runs to a balcony. Francis charges her, and they flip over the railing. Lea lands on top of Francis, but when she gets up, she realizes the shard had pierced Francis in the heart. The front door opens, revealing a bright light, and a bag on the floor. Lea walks to the door, picks up the bag, and leaves. =Alternate endings= The DVD includes two alternate endings. In the first ending, as Lea steps into the light, she is knocked unconscious, and wakes up in her apartment bed. She notices the bag, a small TV set and a videotape. She opens the bag and sees a pile of cash. She plays the tape, and sees the camera footage of the foyer (all the bodies are gone and everything is cleaned up). The Watcher says she just became a member of the world's most exclusive survival club, and that he is very proud. The picture then goes to the bedrooms where there are nine new people passed out on the floor. Lea stares at the screen in shock as The Watcher says, \\"Happy viewing...\\" In the second \\"originally intended\\" ending, as Lea leaves the house, she is led into another house where she meets four people. Each of them has a bag of money. The camera zooms in on Lea; a fearful look grows as she realizes that the game is not over.

Special education In December 2010, the district administration reported that 252 pupils or 20% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 40% of identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2009, the district administration reported that 228 pupils or 17.5% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress . To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the district's Special Education Department. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. Northgate School District received a $821,027 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì12 and 2012-13 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Investing in PA kids, April 2012 In 2009, Northgate School District was identified by the Pennsylvania Department of Education for Least Restrictive Environment monitoring. One hundred ninety six schools districts were selected in 2008-09. The district received an alert letter from the PDE - Bureau of Special Education. School districts were placed in one of three categories: Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3. The district was placed in Tier 3 due to being Identified for category of too many students with IEPs being served in settings outside regular schools. The monitoring is a product of the PDE addressing its voluntary settlement in Gaskin V. Pennsylvania which ordered that special education students spend most of their school day (80%) in regular education classrooms with supplementary aids and services to assist funded by the taxpayers. In 2010, the district continued to be on Tier 3 monitoring list. The district received a letter of ‚ÄúWarning‚Äù letter from the Pennsylvania Department of Education. =Gifted education= Northgate School District Administration reported that fewer than 10 of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Budget In 2013, Superintendent Joseph Pasquerilla recommended to the School Board to eliminate 23 teaching positions and 10 teacher aide positions for the next school year. He reported that the District's enrollment dropped from 1,644 pupils with a staff of 110 teachers during the 1995-96 school year to 1,211 students taught by 115 teachers in 2013.LaRossa, Tony, Northgate slashes 23 teachers, 10 aides for next school year, Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, January 15, 201 In 2011, the average teacher salary in Northgate School District was $58,123.81 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers receive was $16,757 per employee, for a total annual average teacher compensation of $74,881.23. According to a study conducted at the American Enterprise Institute, in 2011, public school teachers‚Äô total compensation is roughly 50 percent higher than they would likely receive in the private sector. The study found that the most generous benefits that teachers receive are not accounted for in many studies of compensation, including: pension, retiree health benefits and job security. In 2009, Northgate School District reported employing 148 teachers and administrators with a median salary of $60,615 and a top salary of $151,666. The teacher's work day is with days in the contract year. Additionally, the teachers receive a defined benefit pension, health insurance (teachers pay $35 per month), professional development reimbursement, paid personal days, 10 paid sick days, and other benefits.Northgate School Board, Northgate Teachers' Union Contracts, 2011 In 2007, the district employed 106 teachers with the average teacher salary in the district at $48,325 for 180 days worked.Fenton, Jacob., Average classroom teacher salary in Allegheny County, 2006-07, The Morning Call, 2009 The district administrative costs in 2008 were $937.72 per pupil. The district ranked 82nd out of 500 school districts for administrative spending. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil.Fenton, Jacob. Pennsylvania School District Data: Will School Consolidation Save Money?, The Morning Call, Feb 2009. Dr. Reggie Bonfield served as Superintendent (salary $151,666 in 2009) resigning July 1, 2012. Kathleen Gallagher assistant to the superintendent, also resigned.Northgate School Board, Northgate School Board Letter to Community Superintendent appointment, April 2012 In 2008, Northgate School District Administration reported that per pupil spending was $12,966 which ranked 177th among Pennsylvania's 501 school districts. In 2010, Northgate's per pupil spending had increased to $13,849.25. Among the states, Pennsylvania's total per pupil revenue (including all sources) ranked 11th at $15,023 per student, in 2008-09. In 2007, the Pennsylvania per pupil total expenditures was $12,759. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that Pennsylvania spent $8,191 per pupil in school year 2000-01. Reserves In 2008, the district reported a balance of $1,200,000.00 in an unreserved-designated fund. The unreserved-undesignated fund balance was reported as $1,408,958.00. In 2010, Northgate's Administration reported $685,213.00 in the unreserved-undesignated fund balance. Pennsylvania school district reserve funds are divided into two categories ‚Äì designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 For the 2010-11 school year, Northgate School Board reduced overstaffing at the high school by 4 positions in order to balance the annual budget. The Board also reduced kindergarten to one half day with a limited full day program for students that need the full day program. In August 2010, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the district. Findings were reported to the administration and school board. The District is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Grants provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the individual's level of wealth. =State basic education funding= For the 2012-13 school year, Northgate School District received $3,839,297. The Governor's Executive Budget for 2012-2013 includes $9.34 billion for kindergarten through 12th grade public education, including $5.4 billion in basic education funding, which is an increase of $49 million over the 2011-12 budget. The state also provides $100 million for the Accountability Block grant. The state will also provide $544.4 million for School Employees‚Äô Social Security and $856 million for School Employees‚Äô Retirement fund called PSERS. This amount is a $21,823,000 increase (0.34%) over the 2011-2012 appropriations for Basic Education Funding, School Employees' Social Security, Pupil Transportation, Nonpublic and Charter School Pupil Transportation. Since taking office, Corbett's first two budgets have restored more than $918 million in support of public schools, compensating for the $1 billion in federal stimulus dollars lost at the end of the 2010-11 school year. In 2011-12, Northgate School District received a $3,760,082, allocation, of state Basic Education Funding. Additionally, Northgate School District received $79,215 in Accountability Block Grant funding. The enacted Pennsylvania state Education budget included $5,354,629,000 for the 2011-2012 Basic Education Funding appropriation. This amount is a $233,290,000 increase (4.6%) over the enacted State appropriation for 2010-2011. The highest increase in state basic education funding was awarded to Duquesne City School District, which got a 49% increase in state funding for 2011-12. In 2010, the district reported that 575 students received free or reduced-price lunches, due to the family meeting the federal poverty level.Pennsylvania Department of Education, District Allocations Report 2009, 2009-10 In the 2010-2011 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 2% increase in Basic Education Funding to Northgate SD for a total of $4,009,049. Among the districts in Allegheny County, the highest increase went to South Fayette Township School District which got an 11.32% increase. One hundred fifty Pennsylvania public school districts received the base 2% increase. The highest increase in 2010-11 went to Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County which received a 23.65% increase in state funding. The state's hold harmless policy regarding state basic education funding continued where each district received at least the same amount as it received the prior school year, even where enrollment had significantly declined. The amount of increase each school district received was set by Governor Edward Rendell and then Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state budget proposal given each February. This was the second year of Governor Rendell's policy to fund some districts at a far greater rate than others. In the 2009-2010 budget year the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 4.53% increase in Basic Education funding for a total of $3,930,440. This was a mid level percentage point increase, in Basic Education Funding, for the school districts in Allegheny County. Many districts received the minimum 2% increase. Four county school districts received increases of over 6% in Basic Education Funding in 2008-10. Chartiers Valley School District received an 8.17% increase. In Pennsylvania, over 15 school districts received Basic Education Funding increases in excess of 10% in 2009. Muhlenberg School District in Berks County received the highest with a 22.31% increase in funding. The state's Basic Education Funding to the Northgate School District in 2008-09 was $3,760,081.99.Pennsylvania Department of Education Report on Funding by school district October 2009 The amount of increase each school district receives is determined by the Governor and the Secretary of Education through the allocation made in the budget proposal made in February each year. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 563 students received free or reduced-price lunches due to low family income in the 2007-2008 school year.Pennsylvania Department of Education Funding Report by LEA 2009. Accountability Block Grants Beginning in 2004-2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11, Northgate School District applied for and received $215,009 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district uses the funding to provide full-day kindergarten for the seventh year. =Science It‚Äôs Elementary grant= Avalon Elementary School successfully applied to participate and received a Science It's Elementary grant in 2008-09. For the 2008-09 school year, the program was offered in 143 schools reaching 2,847 teachers and 66,973 students across Pennsylvania.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Science: It‚Äôs Elementary Grantees Students in 143 Schools Benefit from Intensive Science Curriculum, July 22, 2008 In 2007, the Pennsylvania Department of Education initiated an effort to improve science instruction in the Commonwealth's public elementary schools. Called Science: It's Elementary, the program is a hands on instruction approach for elementary science classes that develops problem-solving and critical thinking skills.Patricia Vathis Pennsylvania Department of Education, Grants and Subsidies Science: It‚Äôs Elementary, 2006 To encourage schools to adopt the program's standards aligned curriculum, the state provided a grant to cover the costs of materials and extensive mandatory teacher training.Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2010 ‚Äì 2011 Science: It‚Äôs Elementary Application Guidelines, July 2010 The district was required to develop a three-year implementation plan for the participating school. The District was required to appoint a district liaison who was paid $3000 by PDE to serve as the conduit of all information between the district and the Department and its agents along with submitting orders and distributing supplies to implementing teachers. For the 2006-07 state education budget, $10 million was allocated. The 2006-07 State Education Budget provided $635 million in new spending for pre-K through 12th grades for the 2006-07 school year. This marks an 8-percent increase over 2005-06 public school funding.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Governor Rendell Commends Teachers for Enhancing Science Education in Pennsylvania, August 10, 2006 The grant program was expanded to $14.5 million in the 2008-09 budget. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006-2009. Northgate School District successfully applied to participate in 2006-07 receiving $256,903. In 2007-08, the district received another $250,000. The district did not apply in 2008-09. In Allegheny County, the highest award was given to Highlands School District which received $835,286. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. In 2010, Classrooms for the Future funding was curtailed statewide due to a massive state financial crisis. Education Assistance grant The state's EAP funding provides for the continuing support of tutoring services and other programs to address the academic needs of eligible students. Funds are available to eligible school districts and full-time career and technology centers (CTC) in which one or more schools have failed to meet at least one academic performance target, as provided for in Section 1512-C of the Pennsylvania Public School Code. In 2010-11, Northgate School District did not apply for funding. Literacy grant Northgate School District was awarded a $710,746 competitive literacy grant. It is to be used to improve reading skills birth through 12th grade. The district was required to develop a lengthy literacy plan, which included outreach into the community. The funds come from a Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant, also referred to as the Keystones to Opportunity grant It is a five-year, competitive federal grant program designed to assist local education agencies in developing and implementing local comprehensive literacy plans. Of the 329 pre-applications by school districts reviewed by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, School District was one of only 148 entities that were invited to submit a full application. In County 5 school districts and one charter school were awarded funding for one year. The funds must be used for teacher training, student screening and assessment, targeted interventions for students reading below grade level and research-based methods of improving classroom instruction and practice. Districts must hire literacy coaches. The coaches work with classroom teachers to enhance their literacy teaching skills. Pennsylvania was among six other states, out of the 35 that applied, to be awarded funding. Pennsylvania received $38 million through the federal program. The Department of Education reserved 5% of the grant for administration costs at the state level. =Federal Stimulus= The district received $995,601 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students.Allegheny County ARRA FUNDING Report. Accessed April 2010. The funding was limited to the 2009‚Äì10 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. Race to the Top Northgate School District officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant, fearing that costs of administering the grant would be too high. In Pennsylvania, only 120 public school districts (out of more than 500) and 56 charter schools decided to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The low number of districts agreeing to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. Consolidation A proposal was made, by David Wassel, a prominent citizen, to consolidate Allegheny County school districts to save tax dollars, focus dollars on student achievement, and improve student services. The plan calls for a proposed district that includes: Avonworth School District and Northgate School District. The proposed district would serve the communities of: Avalon, Bellevue, Ben Avon, Ben Avon Heights, Emsworth and Kilbuck.Wassel, David, The Next Page: For a New Allegheny County -- 26 school districts, 26 municipalities. The PostGazette.com. June 21, 2009. Governor Edward Rendell proposed a consolidation of Pennsylvania's 500 school district to 100 with adjacent school districts, in each county. He suggested that the administrative cost savings be redirected to improving lagging reading, math and science achievement, to enriching the academic programs or to reducing residents' property taxes.Pennsylvania Public School Enrollments by Local Education Agency, January 2009 A study of Pennsylvania public school spending, conducted by Standard and Poor's, found that consolidation of the administration with an adjacent school district would achieve substantial administrative cost savings for people in both communities.Study of the cost-effectiveness of consolidating Pennsylvania School Districts, Standard and Poor's School Evaluation Services, 2007. Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the nation. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. Less than 95 of Pennsylvania's 501 school districts have enrollment below 1250 students, in 2007.Pennsylvania Legislative Budget and Finance Committee, Study of the Cost Effectiveness of Consolidating Pennsylvania School Districts, 2007. This results in excessive school administration bureaucracy and not enough course diversity.Rendell, E. & Soderberg, M. (2009). Pennsylvania school district consolidation. 2009-10 Executive Budget Fast Facts. Pennsylvania Office of the Governor. In a survey of 88 superintendents of small districts, 42% of the respondents stated that they thought consolidation would save money without closing any schools.Study of the cost-effectiveness of consolidating Pennsylvania districts. New York: Standard & Poor‚Äôs School Evaluation Services. 2007, p. 6. In March 2011, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants released a report finding that the state would save hundreds of millions of tax dollars, by cutting the number of school administrations in half through consolidation, with no impact on programs offered to students. =Real estate taxes= Property tax rates in 2012-13 were set by the school board at 28.6 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When the school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2011-12 - 28.6000 mills *2010-11 - 27.6000 mills *2009-10 - 24.5000 mills. *2008-09 - 24.5100 mills. *2007-08 - 24.5000 mills. *2006-07 - 24.5000 mills. Act 1 Adjusted Index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate. The School District Adjusted Index for Northgate School District 2006-2007 through 2011-2012. *2006-07 - 5.2%, Base 3.9% *2007-08 - 4.6%, Base 3.4% *2008-09 - 6.0%, Base 4.4% *2009-10 - 5.6%, Base 4.1% *2010-11 - 4.0%, Base 2.9% *2011-12 - 1.9%, Base 1.4% *2012-13 - 2.3%, Base 1.7% Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2012-2013 School District Adjusted Index, May 2011 *2013-14 - 2.3%, Base 1.7% Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2013-2014 School District Adjusted Index, May 2012 For the 2012-13 budget year, Northgate School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index. For 2012-2013, 274 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 223 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2012-2013, March 30, 2012 For the 2011-12 school year, Northgate School Board applied for three exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index: Maintenance of Selected Revenue Sources, Special Education costs, and Teacher pension costs. While the District received approval for all three exceptions, they did not receive the full amounts requested. Each year, Northgate School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. Northgate School Board applied for three exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budget in 2011, including: Maintenance of Selected Revenue Sources, Special Education costs, and Teacher pension costs. All three were fully approved by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. For 2009-10 school budget, the board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Index.

The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Beaver County, 62% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009.Pennsylvania Auditor General Office, Special Report Pennsylvania Property Tax Relief, 2-23-2010. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently people who have an income of substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This tax rebate can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. In 2012, Pennsylvania Secretary of the Treasury reported issuing more than half a million property tax rebates totaling $238 million.Elias, Joe., Pennsylvania Treasury Department to issue $238 million in property tax rebates, The Harrisburg Patriot-News, June 30, 2012 The program is funded by the Pennsylvania Lottery.

(doing business as Zehrs Markets or simply Zehrs), is a Canadian supermarket chain in southern Ontario. The chain has 43 locations and is a part of Loblaw Companies Limited which purchased the Zehrs chain in the mid-1970s. History A Zehrs Markets store The first store was established by Emory Zehr and his sons in Kitchener in 1950 and was focused mainly on food. Some of the earliest locations were on Lancaster Street, Belmont Avenue and Highland Road in Kitchener. Until the 1980s, Zehrs had its own line of certain foods, including pop and potato chips; these were eventually replaced by Loblaws' President's Choice line of products. Television commercials for Zehrs included a brief tune with the words \\"When it comes right down to the one and only reason; you're important to us.\\" Until 1995, the store's logo was a red or orange square, with two small lines to make it a boldened stylized \\"Z\\". Zehrs stores have been known in Ontario by three distinct names: Zehrs Markets, Zehrs Food Plus and Zehrs Greatfood (similar to the new Loblaw Greatfood locations opened in the Greater Toronto Area). In 2010, Zehrs unveiled a new logo and store design, renovating several stores to the new format. The new stores are known as Zehrs Markets, as opposed to the new Zehrs Greatfood format that had been opened only a couple of years before. A Kingsville location was changed from a Greatfood to a Zehrs Markets, but is once again operating as a Zehrs Greatfood. The business entity is known as Zehrmart Ltd, which is operated by its parent company, Loblaw Companies Limited. Zehrs employees are represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1977 as well as the UFCW Local 175/633. Current operations A Zehrs supermarket in Barrie, 2016The administrative portion of this banner is located in Brampton, Ontario. Zehrs Markets regions are divided into three districts, numbered from 1‚Äì3. Every department in the store has its own specialist for its district, and further expansion into areas of marketing and merchandising are being utilized most recently. Zehrs operates stores in large cities and small towns throughout southern Ontario. Locations stretch from Kingsville in the south to Orillia in the north, and from Windsor in the west to Niagara Falls in the east and northeast to Uxbridge. It does not have any locations in the Hamilton or Toronto metropolitan areas. It is notable that there are no Zehrs stores in the London-St. Thomas area right in the middle of Zehrs' main market area; that is one of the few areas of southern Ontario where Loblaws had several stores operating when it acquired Zehrs and due to the strength of the Loblaws name in that area that name was retained whereas other Loblaws locations scattered throughout southwestern Ontario were renamed to Zehrs. Locations of a chain of grocery stores in far southwestern Ontario (Windsor, Chatham, Kingsville, Sarnia) named Gordons were renamed to Zehrs in the 1990s. Loblaws has been introducing the Real Canadian Superstore banner to southwestern Ontario and some Zehrs have been renamed to that in recent years. As a \\"one-stop\\" shop, Zehrs stores contain traditional departments such as fresh bakery, meat and produce, and newer non-traditional departments such as optical stores, wine shops, President's Choice Financial banking kiosks, clothing and electronics departments. In March 2005, Zehrmart Ltd and Fortinos Grocery Stores (both under the Loblaw umbrella) merged their operations and are now run as one unit. In September 2005, all Ontario operations of Loblaw Companies Limited and the banners began moving into the newly constructed office at 1 President's Choice Circle, Brampton, Ontario. As with other Loblaw stores, Zehrs is noted for carrying President's Choice products. At newer stores, such as in Guelph or Barrie, the Zehrs logo has the familiar \\"L\\" logo from Loblaws added.

He was the managing general partner of the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball from 1993 to 2008. He served as the chief executive officer of Safeway Inc. from 1979 through 1993. Early life and career Magowan was born in New York City in 1942.\\"Peter A. Magowan\\" Daimler Chrysler Corporate Site Retrieved on December 25, 2007 His maternal grandfather was Charles Merrill (1885‚Äì1956), co-founder of Merrill Lynch and instrumental in the formation of Safeway. Magowan's father, Robert Anderson Magowan, was chairman and CEO of Safeway; Magowan's mother, Doris Merrill Magowan (1914‚Äì2001), was a philanthropist. Magowan was the nephew of poet James Merrill (1926‚Äì1995). Magowan was a native of New York City and was a New York Giants fan prior to the team moving to San Francisco. He completed high school from Groton School, had a bachelor's degree from Stanford University and a master's degree from the University of Oxford. He also did post-graduate work at Johns Hopkins University. Following graduation from Stanford, Magowan joined Safeway as a real estate negotiator in Washington D.C. He also worked as a District Manager in Houston, a Retail Operations Manager in Phoenix and a Division Manager in Tulsa. From 1976 to 1978 he was in charge of the Company's international operations. He was elected a Director of Safeway in 1978 following the death of his father. In 1979, Magowan was elected as chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of Safeway. Safeway's poor performance led to it being the target of corporate raiders, resulting in acquisition by KKR acting as a white knight, but he stayed on as CEO until 1993, when he resigned to devote all his time to the Giants.Associated Press: \\"Longtime San Francisco Giants owner Peter Magowan dies\\", USA Today, January 27, 2019. Magowan was also a director of Caterpillar, Inc., DaimlerChrysler, and Spring Group, PLC. San Francisco Giants Magowan, along with a group of investors (including Charles B. Johnson, Scott Seligman, Philip Halperin, Allan Byer, and David S. Wolff) purchased the franchise on January 12, 1993, from the previous owner, Bob Lurie. Before Magowan's consortium stepped in with its offer to buy the team, Lurie had planned to sell the team to a group from St. Petersburg, Florida, now home to the Tampa Bay Rays. Magowan made his mark on the team immediately, signing free agent superstar Barry Bonds, a San Francisco Bay Area-native whose father, Bobby Bonds, began his career as a Giant. Magowan was also noted for spearheading the construction of the Giants' current home, Oracle Park (previously AT&T; Park, SBC Park and Pacific Bell Park). Previously, several initiatives to build tax-supported stadiums had been rejected by San Francisco voters. In December 1995, Magowan unveiled his plan for a 42,000 seat ballpark in China Basin, which would be privately funded ‚Äì the first ballpark built without public funds in over 30 years. The plan was passed easily by San Francisco voters, by a two-to-one margin.\\"Peter A. Magowan: President and Managing General Partner\\" SF Giants Website Retrieved on December 25, 2007 In late 2007 and early 2008, Peter Magowan and Giants general manager Brian Sabean drew some criticism in the Mitchell Report when it was revealed Giants athletic trainer Stan Conte came to Sabean and told him he suspected Bonds trainer Greg Anderson was distributing steroids and Giants management did not investigate or tell Major League Baseball. Conte had been approached by a player. In the January 2007 Congressional hearings on performance-enhancing drugs, Congressman Henry Waxman asked Commissioner Bud Selig to discipline Sabean and Magowan for their culpability. Some sports insiders argued that Magowan's and Sabean's actions on steroids were not any different from other clubs at the time. When Magowan was interviewed for the Mitchell Report, Magowan told Senator George Mitchell that Barry Bonds told him he had used steroids; he withdrew that assertion a few days later. On May 16, 2008, Magowan announced he would be stepping down as managing partner of the Giants effective October 1. Bill Neukom succeeded Magowan as the principal shareholder and lead representative of the investors in the San Francisco Giants. On November 3, 2010, Magowan participated in the Giants victory parade as the team celebrated its first World Series title since moving to San Francisco in 1958. In 2016, he was elected to the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame. The Giants will induct Magowan in their Wall of Fame in 2019.

History KENO, Las Vegas' first successful radio station, was founded in 1941 by Laura Belle and Maxwell Kelch. (John Heaton had operated KGIX from 1930 to 1935, but low power and limited hours made it unprofitable.) For much of its early history, KENO broadcast out of the El Rancho Vegas on Las Vegas Boulevard. Southern Nevada's first radio show was called \\"Listen Ladies\\" and was hosted by Laura Belle Kelch. Listen Ladies provided home and household advice to women in the 1940s. The station played top 40 from the 1950s to the early 1980s, using the slogan \\"Music Radio 1460\\" in the 1960s and 70s. KENO also had and FM station at 92.3, until 1982 when it changed its call sign to KOMP and began playing album- oriented rock. KENO 1460 switched to AC/oldies in the early 1980s and then went to the straight oldies format in the latter part of the decade around 1987 and 1988. The oldies format lasted until 1993. KENO was originally on 1370 kHz. Under the NARBA treaty of March, 1941 it moved to 1400 kHz. It moved to 1460 kHz in 1951. Prior to switching to Spanish, KENO was the Las Vegas affiliate of the Jim Rome Show. The station was the flagship station for the Las Vegas 51s, then the Class AAA affiliate of the Los Angeles Dodgers. On March 3, 2008, the station changed its format to ESPN Deportes Radio, and the previous programming was moved to KBAD 920 kHz. KBAD's programming was moved to 1100 kHz, KWWN. KENO is the flagship station for Spanish-language broadcasts of the Vegas Golden Knights of the National Hockey League. In 2017, an agreement was made for KENO to broadcast select Golden Knights games which made the Golden Knights the third team in the NHL to offer Spanish-language radio broadcasts. KENO is the flagship station for Spanish-language broadcasts of the Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League. The station started carrying the games in 2020 and is the flagship for a group of eight stations across Nevada and California carrying Raider games in Spanish.

(PMI) is an American catalog order company that sells giftware. The company was initially formed in 1978 by the illustrator Samuel J. Butcher, as a licensing company. History Illustrator Sam Butcher, together with his partner Bill Biel, sold greeting cards at Christian book fairs under the company name of Jonathan & David. They partnered with Enesco, Corp. to sell giftware. In 1991, the company created a series of seasonal animated specials, starting with the Christmas special, Timmy's Gift, which focuses on an angel named Timmy following a star which will lead him to the newborn prince (later to be revealed as Jesus) he has to send a gift to. In 1993, a sequel was made titled Timmy's Special Delivery. Other seasonal specials would be made throughout the 1990s, including the Easter special Simon the Lamb, the Thanksgiving movie Little Sparrow, Who's Who at the Zoo?, and The Story of Joseph, based on the story of the same name seen in the Book of Genesis. In 2004, PMI and Enesco ended the licensing contract In addition to its original licensing duties, PMI's functions became product design, marketing, warehousing, and distribution. In 2008, PMI launched its new line of \\"Precious Girls Club\\" products, written by Cindy Kenney. The following September, the company was sued by country music singer Shannon Clemmons for copyright infringement and breach of contract. In October 2008, the federal judge assigned to the case dismissed 15 of 18 claims against PMI in the suit, and in November 2008, a jury cleared PMI of any wrongdoing with regard to the remaining counts.

Nomenclature  Œ¥¬π Tauri (Latinised to Delta¬π Tauri) is the system's Bayer designation. The designations of the two constituents as Delta¬π Tauri A and B, and those of A's components - Delta¬π Tauri Aa and Ab - derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The system bore the traditional name Hyadum II, which is Latin for \\"Second of the Hyades\\". In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. It approved the name Secunda Hyadum for the component Delta¬π Tauri Aa on 5 September 2017 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.

It was formed in July 1948 to operate three B-17 Flying Fortresses which the fledgling Israeli Air Force had acquired in the United States. The squadron flew the Flying Fortress, a type credited with propelling the IAF into the realm of modern aerial warfare, during both the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War and 1956 Suez Crisis. Disbanded in early 1957, 69 Squadron reformed in 1969 to fly the F-4 Phantom II. 69 Squadron operated the Kurnass (Sledgehammer), as the Phantom was known in Israel, for 25 years and its Phantoms saw extensive action during the War of Attrition, Yom Kippur War, First Lebanon War and numerous engagements in between. The squadron often played a central role in IAF suppression of enemy air defences (SEAD) efforts and took part in repeated battles against Egyptian and Syrian air defence arrays. The squadron retired its Phantoms in 1994 but reformed shortly thereafter to operate the F-15I Thunder. Described as the \\"long-range, heavy bombing element of Israeli air power\\", 69 Squadron, together with Squadrons 119 and 253, carried out Operation Outside the Box, the 6 September 2007 airstrike on a nuclear site in Syria. Formation and B-17 yearsIsraeli War of Independence= In early 1948, with the upcoming end of the British Mandate for Palestine and the looming confrontation with Israel's Arab neighbors, the leadership of the Yishuv embarked on a worldwide effort to purchase weapons. Despite an American arms embargo, Israeli acquisition agents managed to purchase four commercial B-17 Flying Fortresses in the US. Two were demilitarised and modified for freighter use by Aerodex Inc. of Miami, then sold unknowingly to a front company that said they would be used in the Caribbean. The first two departed the city on June 12, followed a day later by a third, and made their way first to Puerto Rico and then across the Atlantic via the Azores to ≈Ωatec, Czechoslovakia, where they arrived on June 14. By June 16 the story had made it to the press and the fourth plane, whose crew only barely managed to elude the FBI, was impounded in the Azores by Portuguese authorities. At ≈Ωatec the three B-17s, missing bomb shackles and sights, oxygen systems and defensive weapons, were militarized and the squadron that was to operate them, at the time referred to as the \\"Hammers Program\\", first took shape. Ray Kurtz, a former B-17 navigator with 31 missions over Europe, was assigned command of the squadron, staffed by an international crew of World War II veterans who volunteered to fight for Israel.Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 9-14. Robert Luttrell, a sailor by trade, flying as a bombardier, recalled that for each mission the B-17s were given new markings and their armament was altered to lead the enemy to believe Israel possessed an entire squadron of the type.Luttrell, Robert J., \\"I flew for Israel,\\" Flying Magazine, May 1949, p.58; illustration on p.23. Israeli B-17s in flight, 1953 On July 15, 1948, with fighting raging in Israel and Tel Aviv suffering from Royal Egyptian Air Force (REAF) raids, the three B-17s departed ≈Ωatec for Israel. Still ill-equipped, the bombers were nevertheless tasked with bombing Egyptian targets en route. Flying south along the Adriatic, near Crete the bombers separated with Bill Katz and Ray Kurtz taking the only Fortress with an oxygen system and a proper sight to bomb the royal palace in Cairo, and the other two B-17s heading towards the REAF base at El- Arish. While Katz and Kurtz successfully bombed the Abdeen Palace, the other two failed to locate their target and bombed Rafah instead, and all landed that evening at Tel Nof.Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 14-15.Nordeen and Nicolle 1996, p. 96. The three aircraft were back in action at 06:30 on the very next day, hitting the REAF base at El-Arish they had missed the previous night. As Tel-Nof was deemed vulnerable to Egyptian attacks, the aircraft then landed at Ramat David, which was to house the squadron for the remainder of the war. In the following days, until a UN-brokered ceasefire came into effect on July 18, the Fortresses struck across three fronts, attacking Majdal, Damascus and Tulkarm. Raising the average bomb load of an IAF sortie from 100 kg per sortie to 743 kg per sortie, the B-17s are credited with propelling the Israeli Air Force into the realm of modern aerial warfare. Save for a single mission by all three bombers in support of Operation Shoter on July 20, combat operations ceased until October 1948. These three months saw the unit reorganize and by August it had received its official designation as 69 Squadron. With Bill Katz now in command, the squadron spent the truce training, qualifying new airmen and equipping the veteran aircraft.Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 20-25. Fighting resumed on October 15 with Operation Yoav, aimed with breaking the Egyptian siege of the Negev. Over the next week the Hammers flew 47 sorties against Egyptian targets in and around Majdal, Gaza, El Arish, Al-Faluja, and Rafah. Missions were flown in either a trio or a pair to maximize defensive firepower, and sometimes with 101 Squadron escorts, but no enemy fighters were ever encountered. In late October a number of sorties were also flown against Tarshiha, in the Upper Galilee, in support of Operation Hiram against Fawzi al-Qawuqji's Arab Liberation Army.Nordeen and Nicolle 1996, p. 102.Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 25-36. Operation Yoav had left Faluja as an enclave within Israeli-held territory and during November 1948 the Hammers routinely returned to bomb what became known as the Faluja Pocket.Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 36-39. The town would nonetheless hold out until the end of the war. On December 22 Israel launched Operation Horev, its last major offensive of the war, to finally defeat the Egyptian expeditionary force and expel it beyond the borders of Mandatory Palestine. 69 Squadron once again flew in support of Israeli efforts in the south, targeting the air base at El-Arish, Khan Younis, Gaza and Rafah. The squadron also revisited Faluja to prevent an Egyptian sortie from the beleaguered pocket, and on New Year's Day 1949 flew a failed attempt to bomb an Egyptian Navy flotilla which had shelled Tel Aviv. 69 Squadron flew its last missions of the war in the early morning of January 7, 1949, against Rafah. Having evaded Egyptian flak on most occasions, both participating bombers were hit, rendering one unserviceable.Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 40-53. =Postwar deactivation= PBY Catalina at the Israeli Air Force Museum in Hatzerim. The aircraft bears the B-17-era squadron badge With the end of the 1948 Arab Israeli War, the majority of volunteer airmen returned home, and 69 Squadron once again went through a period of reorganization. From an English-speaking outfit it was transformed into a Hebrew speaking unit. Training was stepped up to qualify Israelis to take over vacated positions and the squadron settled into a peacetime routine, with the B-17s conducting bombing and cloud seeding tests and participating in IDF exercises. The IAF itself was undergoing major changes, and in early May 1949 69 Squadron relocated to Tel Nof. In October 1951 the squadron moved once more, this time to Hatzor. In December 1952 the three B-17 was joined by three PBY Catalinas, acquired to guarantee supply to the town of Eilat at Israel's southern extremity. Utilization of these aircraft, however, was low and they were soon withdrawn from service with the squadron. Spares, meanwhile, were also hampering B-17 operations and in March 1954 69 Squadron was deactivated and its assets handed over to 103 Squadron,Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 56-79. which soon retired the Catalinas but continued to operate the three B-17s.Aloni and Avidror 2010, p. 80. =Suez Crisis= In 1956 growing diplomatic tensions in the Middle East, tensions that would soon culminate in the Suez Crisis, resulted in the resurrection of 69 Squadron. On April 19 the IAF issued an order reactivating the squadron at Ramat David, with Nahum Efrat as its commanding officer. The squadron was soon tasked with its first mission, allocating two B-17s for search and rescue operations during Dassault Myst√®re delivery flights from France to Israel. The reformed squadron once again began training personnel and equipping the aircraft for possible hostilities. As Israel purchased more jet fighters, however, room had to be made for the new arrivals, and in September 1956 the IAF ordered the squadron to send its aircraft into storage and changed its status to reserve. By October 3 the aircraft had been stored at Bedek Aviation (later Israeli Aircraft Industries) at Lod, but only three weeks later, on October 25, the IAF activated the squadron once more.Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 80-84. Only two Fortresses had left Bedek's storage facility by the time hostilities commenced on October 29, 1956. The squadron had not flown a single training sortie before fighting began and had only two full crews ready for battle. Israeli piston-engined aircraft flew few missions in the first two days of the war, but on October 31, 69 Squadron received an order to bomb Rafah in support of IDF Brigade 27 operations. Arriving over the target early on November 1, the aircraft could not tell the location of friendly troops and without being able to communicate with the forces on the ground, were forced to dump their bomb loads in the Mediterranean. The B-17s were back in action the following night, to attack retreating Egyptian forces. A repeat of the previous night's lack of communications with Israeli forces operating in the same area once again prevented the strike, and the bombers dropped their loads on the outskirts of Gaza.Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 84-86. With the threat of Egyptian air power curtailed by Anglo-French strikes against Egyptian air bases, the B-17s began flying daylight operations. On November 2 the squadron supported the Israeli push towards Sharm el Sheikh, on the southern tip of the Sinai. Two aircraft bombed the local barracks but were met with effective anti-aircraft fire which damaged the lead aircraft. The damaged aircraft managed to return to Ramat David, just as the third B-17 returned from storage at Bedek. Two aircraft were therefore available for the B-17s' final combat sorties with the IAF, another failed strike on Sharm el Sheikh on November 4. The squadron had flown a total of 8 sorties throughout the war and dropped 27 tons of bombs. With the conclusion of hostilities the squadron continued training and on November 10 even moved once more to Tel Nof. The B-17s flew a few more sorties during a January 1957 survey of the Sinai but were soon sent back to storage. 69 Squadron was finally disbanded on March 1, 1957. It was initially slated to operate the IAF's next heavy bomber, the Sud-Ouest Vautour, but these plans were dropped in favour of 110 Squadron.Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 86-89. Flying the F-4 Phantom IIWar of Attrition= Checkered tail of 69 Squadron F-4 Phantom II 69 Squadron was reactivated at Ramat David on November 1, 1969, headed by Major Avihu Ben-Nun. A year earlier Israel had ordered 50 F-4 Phantoms, enough to equip two squadrons, and ten IAF airmen had spent March to August 1969 training with the 479th Tactical Training Wing at George Air Force Base. These included five 69 Squadron airmen: Ben-Nun, Ehud Hankin, Rami Harpaz, Shaul Levi and Achikar Eyal. Upon their return to Israel, then in the midst of the War of Attrition, the 69 Squadron airmen flew both training and combat missions with 201 Squadron, the IAF's first Kurnass squadron.Norton 2004, p. 228.Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 100-106. On one such mission on November 11, Hankin and Eyal shot down an Egyptian MiG-21 to score the Phantom's first aerial victory with the IAF.Aloni Israeli Phantom II Aces 2004, p. 86. 69 Squadron finally received its first four aircraft on November 15, the third Peace Echo I batch to arrive in Israel. Although still far from the 12 aircraft required to achieve IAF operational certification, on November 25, 1969, Avihu Ben-Nun led the squadron's debut operational mission, a combat air patrol (CAP). The first air-to-ground mission came three days later, when two Phantoms struck an Egyptian SA-2 battery near Fayid. Still busy forming, receiving new aircraft, training and qualifying fresh airmen, the squadron was soon taking an increasingly large part in the IAF's ongoing battles against Egyptian air defences along the Suez Canal. When the IAF launched Operation Priha (Blossom) against targets in the Egyptian heartland during January 1970, 69 Squadron was at the forefront of the fighting, and on February 8, 1970, pilot Aviem Sella and navigator Shabtai Ben-Shoa downed an Egyptian Air Force MiG-21. Operations, meanwhile, were also conducted to deter Syria from joining the fight, with Phantoms conducting low level runs over Damascus on January 6, 1970, and over 5 major Syrian cities on January 29.Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 100-111.Norton 2004, p. 229. The squadron nevertheless suffered its first combat loss on April 2, when Gideon Magen and Pinchas Nachmani were shot down by a Syrian MiG-21 to become prisoners of war.Aloni and Avidror 2010, p. 113. Israeli aerial supremacy prompted Egypt to turn to the USSR for assistance and by the spring of 1970 an entire Soviet air defence division had deployed to Egypt.Aloni Israeli Mirage and Nesher Aces 2004, pp. 57-58. The Soviet presence spelled the end of Priha and Egypt regained the initiative, rolling its air defence array towards the Suez Canal. The IAF sought to hamper these advances through a renewed SEAD campaign and 69 Squadron saw repeated action against Egyptian air defences and related infrastructure. Egyptian SAMs, however, soon exacted their toll on the attackers, with Rami Harpaz and Achikar Eyal falling into Egyptian captivity on June 30, a fate shared by Amos Zamir and Amos Levitov on July 5.Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 115-118. AN/ALQ-71 Electronic countermeasures (ECM) pods were soon rushed to Israel but proved only partially effective against surface-to-air missiles. On July 18, the IAF attempted to fly eight F-4 Phantoms in close-knit pod formations thought to maximize the effect of the ECM pods, only to lose 201 Squadron leader Shmuel Hetz, while an injured Avihu Ben-nun was forced to crash land his badly damaged aircraft at Rephidim.Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 118-119. The SEAD campaign was halted, but although the IAF possessed no operational answer to the massive air defence array forming west of the Canal, it nevertheless still enjoyed supremacy in the air-to-air arena. On July 30, 69 Squadron took part in Operation Rimon 20, a ruse designed to draw Soviet-flown MiG-21s into battle. In the ensuing dogfight, five Soviet fighters were downed, of which one was shot down by Avihu Ben-Nun with Shaul Levi and another by Aviem Sella with Reuven Reshef. With no side securing a clear advantage, yet both able to claim military achievements, American pressure soon bore fruit and a ceasefire marking the end of the war came into effect on August 7, 1970.Aloni Israeli Phantom II Aces 2004, pp. 13‚Äì14.Norton 2004, p. 206. =Reconnaissance= With the next round of the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict deemed a mere matter of time, peacetime saw 69 Squadron engaged in developing new SEAD tactics and weapons and in renewed reconnaissance efforts. New weapons such as the AGM-45 Shrike and AGM-12 Bullpup were introduced for the SEAD role, and on September 18, 1971, the Hammers flew their first Shrike strike against an Egyptian SA-2 battery following the downing of an Israeli C-97 Stratocruiser. As for reconnaissance, the IAF had ordered the RF-4E reconnaissance variant of the Phantom, but these were not slated for delivery until 1971. 69 Squadron had already modified two F-4s in early 1970 for the role by removing their cannons and replacing them with cameras,Norton 2004, pp. 231‚Äì232. and after the ceasefire these were joined by a pair of loaned American RF-4Cs, which were in operation until the squadron received two RF-4Es in early 1971. While 119 Squadron, which had transitioned to the F-4 in 1970, specialized in high-altitude photography, 69 Squadron adopted low- altitude photography. A mission by reconnaissance Phantoms over northern Syria on September 13, 1973, triggered a large scale clash between the two air forces, resulting in the downing of 13 Syrian MiGs (one at the hands of 69 Squadron's Amnon Arad) and the loss of a single Israeli Mirage III.Aloni Israeli Phantom II Aces 2004, pp. 21‚Äì22. =Yom Kippur War= Experienced and well-trained, 69 Squadron nevertheless entered the Yom Kippur War unready for the challenges brought about by start of the war. Prior to the outbreak of war, the IAF had been preparing for a pre-emptive strike against Egyptian and Syrian positions, but this was rejected by the Israeli government. 69 Squadron aircraft were in the process of re-armament to the air-to-air role when hostilities began at 14:00 on October 6, 1973. The aircraft were scrambled to perform CAPs, some having to dump their bomb loads in the Mediterranean, yet no aerial opposition was encountered. The squadron flew 37 sorties on the first day of the war, of which only 4 were strike missions, while two aircraft suffered damage from SA-7s over the Golan Heights.Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 129‚Äì130. The next morning saw the squadron participate in Operation Tagar, a SEAD offensive against Egyptian air defences, which began with strikes against Egyptian air bases. Seven Phantoms led by squadron leader Yoram Agmon struck the air base at Gianaclis, and although two defending MiG-21s were shot down, the strike failed to cause significant damage. Tagar, moreover, was quickly discontinued when the dire situation on the Golan Heights became apparent, and 69 Squadron efforts were redirected north where the IAF staged the ill-fated Operation Doogman 5. Flying with outdated intelligence and no electronic screening against mobile SAM batteries and heavy flak, 6 IAF Phantoms were lost, including 69 Squadron's Ehud Hankin and Shaul Levy in Kurnass 123. Both were killed. The same evening saw appeals for help from the southern front, leading the squadron to fly strike missions against Egyptian bridges and assembly point on the Suez Canal. Another Phantom was lost to surface-to-air missiles, its crew falling into captivity. Four more aircraft were lost on the following day, October 8. One was lost in an otherwise successful morning strike against the Syrian air base at Dumayr, its crew captured. Another was lost over the Golan Heights, and two more during night strikes against Egyptian bridges across the canal, all falling prey to the SA-6. Although four airmen were rescued by Israeli forces, pilot Zvulun Amizi and navigator Zeev Yogev were killed.Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 130‚Äì139. \\"Toad\\"-liveried F-4E Phantom II Three days into the war 69 Squadron had lost six aircraft, four airmen had been killed and four became prisoners of war. The detailed planning and extensive training undertaken before the war had gone to waste and the sustained campaign required to defeat enemy air defences was abandoned in the face of Egyptian and Syrian advances. Nevertheless, it had been the close air support provided by the IAF that helped Israeli troops on the ground to stem the tide and eventually go on the offensive, first in the north and later in the south.Norton 2004, pp. 38‚Äì39. October 10 saw the Hammers strike the Egyptian air base at Quweisna, while two Syrian MiGs were claimed on the northern front. The next day saw the IDF push into Syria, and 69 Squadron was at hand striking fuel depots, SAM sites and the air bases at Dumayr, Nasiriya and Damascus. One aircraft was lost over Lebanon, where its crew were interned until the end of the war.Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 140‚Äì143. Syria was the primary target for air base strikes on October 12 and 13 as well. Yoram Agmon and Daniel Whittman claimed two aerial victories, one on each of these two days, but the squadron lost another aircraft on October 14, possibly the result of friendly fire on the southern front, though the crew was rescued. The same day witnessed the IAF begin receiving attrition replacements from USAF stocks. These Phantoms were delivered in their darker Southeast Asia scheme and rushed into service without repainting, gaining the name \\"Toads\\". To ease maintenance, most were retained by 69 Squadron which transferred several of its airframes to 201 Squadron.Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 144‚Äì145 Unlike Israeli aircraft, the new aircraft were equipped with TISEO targeting equipment, allowing them to launch the AGM-65 Maverick, another component of the American airlift. 69 Squadron was therefore entrusted with the introduction of the Maverick into Israeli service. No training flights were flown, the first launch occurring in combat, against a Syrian-held bunker on the Hermon. Some 50 missiles were launched in the course of the war.Aloni and Avidror 2010, p. 150. 69 Squadron continued hammering Syrian infrastructure and Egyptian air bases in the following days, and on October 16 Yoram Agmon shot down a Syrian MiG-21 to become to only pilot to achieve ace status while flying with the squadron.Aloni and Avidror 2010, p. 146. The Hammers flew their final air base strike of the war on October 20, striking the EAF air base at Khutamiyah. Pilot Doodi Zait and navigator Yoram Rubinstein were hit by a SAM and forced to ejected, becoming POWs in Egypt.Aloni and Avidror 2010, p. 148. =Postwar activity= The Yom Kippur War ended on October 24. 69 Squadron had flown 789 sorties, had lost 9 aircraft, and had shot down 10 enemy aircraft. Four airmen had been killed and eight had become prisoners of war.Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 152, 224. The end of the war, however, did not spell an end to the fighting. On December 6, a mixed 69 and 119 squadrons combat air patrol over the Gulf of Suez engaged a flight of MiG-21s to score one kill, possibly two. The kill was credited to 69's Yiftach Shadmi and Meir Gur, with the MiG-21s revealed to be a part of a North Korean contingent that had deployed to Egypt during the war.Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 153‚Äì154.Aloni Israeli Phantom II Aces 2004, pp. 78‚Äì79. With the arrival of spring fighting also resumed in the north, where Israel and Syria had yet to sign a disengagement agreement.Aloni 2001, p. 88. On April 8, 1974, while on patrol against low flying Syrian helicopters, the squadron lost one of its aircraft, probably to a shoulder-launched SA-7. The crew, Shadmi and Rafaeli, were interned in Lebanon for a month. Three weeks later, on April 29, the squadron scored two aerial kills against Syrian MiG-21s, the squadron's final victories to date. Fighting only ceased on May 31. The postwar years were spent implementing the lessons of the Yom Kippur War. SEAD tactics were improved, training was stepped up and innovative technologies introduced. The Hammers cooperated with Rafael, Israel's weapon systems development authority, in the introduction of the Tadmit electro-optical fire-and-forget guided bomb, a modified version of the AGM-62 Walleye II. At the same time, the Phantom's air-to-air role was diminished with the introduction into service of the F-15 Eagle and the F-16 Fighting Falcon.Aloni Israeli Phantom II Aces 2004, pp. 76‚Äì78. The squadron was, nonetheless, the first IAF squadron to introduce Rafael's Python 3 into service in March 1977. Air-to-air training continued and on December 29, 1977, during combat against a pair of F-15s, two squadron aircraft collided. Squadron leader Avsha Friedman and navigator Avihu Ikar were killed. The remains of their aircraft, Kurnass 305, stand as a memorial to the two pilots on the Acre-Carmiel road. On January 20, 1981, the squadron lost another pilot in similar circumstances, when Kurnass 222 collided with F-16 222. Squadron leader Eliezer Adar ejected, but Dani Weiss was killed, as was the F-16 pilot, Uri Ben-Amitai. The Hammers flew 28 support, 13 reconnaissance and 6 combat air patrols during Operation Litani, Israel's March 1978 invasion of Lebanon. In 1976 the squadron had received two additional RF-4Es, and was soon flying high-altitude reconnaissance. This led to its participation in the preparations for the 1981 Operation Opera to destroy Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor, which the Hammers were initially planned to conduct. The squadron trained for the raid using the Tadmit, but these plans were dropped when the F-16 entered IAF service in 1980. On November 12, 1980, the squadron carried out the IAF's longest fighter mission hitherto, when two reconnaissance birds photographed the reactor near Baghdad. The mission witnessed three aerial refuelings, including one over enemy territory.Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 160‚Äì161. Tensions over Lebanon flared once more in 1981, and on May 29, 1981, the squadron carried out Operation Mole 9, striking Libyan SA-9 batteries protecting PLO bases near Beirut.Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 163‚Äì164. =1982 Lebanon War= By the spring of 1982 tensions had risen again and the attempted assassination of the Israeli ambassador to London Shlomo Argov on June 3, 1982, prompted Israel to launch Operation Peace for Galilee.Norton 2004, p. 44. 69 Squadron flew 27 sorties in the preparation phase for the operation, from June 4 to the actual beginning of the invasion on June 6. The first of these were carried out on the afternoon of June 4, when a 4-ship formation struck the stadium in Beirut, used as a PLO weapons depot. Once Israeli ground forces began pushing into Lebanon, 69 Squadron provided close air support. One aircraft was damaged by enemy flak on the first day of the invasion, and two suffered landing accidents, but with poor weather and a shortage of targets, there was initially little fighting to be done.Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 165‚Äì167. This changed on June 8 when it became apparent the Syrian forces in Lebanon would have to be engaged, and that same afternoon two squadron Phantoms bombed a Syrian electronic warfare facility on Jabel Barouk.Aloni and Avidror 2010, p. 167. Kill-marking borne by Mole Cricket 19 Phantoms Syrian SAMs had been a constant threat to IAF operations, and as the war progressed the Syrian SAM array in the Bekaa Valley was bolstered with additional batteries. It was therefore decided to launch a comprehensive assault on the Syrian defences, in order to secure aerial superiority over the area and ensure air support for Israeli ground forces. At 14:00 on June 9 the IAF launched Operation Mole Cricket 19, the culmination of 10 years of planning and preparation. 69 Squadron participated with 13 Tadmit and four follow-up free-fall bombers sent against the Syrians. The former operated individually, targeting Syrian fire control centers and radars, in all engaging seven SAM batteries. Mole Cricket 19 was a resounding success, with 14 out of 19 SAM batteries in the Bekaa destroyed and dozens of Syrian fighters downed in the ensuing dogfights.Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 168‚Äì170.Aloni 2001, p. 90. After the peak of June 9, during which 29 sorties were flown, activity declined. 12 more sorties were flown on June 10 and 19 on June 11, when a ceasefire came into effect. The squadron had flown 152 sorties throughout the offensive, of which 71 were close air support, 35 SEAD and 31 reconnaissance.Aloni and Avidror 2010, p. 173. Once again, the official end of hostilities did not spell an end to fighting and Israel remained engaged in Lebanon for years to come. When the Syrians introduced the SA-8 Gecko into Lebanon in July 1982, IAF Phantoms were sent to hunt down four launchers on July 24 and two were claimed by 69 Squadron. Up to its very disbandment in 1994, the squadron also took part in repeated strikes against terrorist organizations operating from Lebanon. On one such operation on October 16, 1986, a bomb exploded immediately after release from Kurnass 306, forcing both crew to eject. The pilot, Yishai Aviram, was rescued by an IAF AH-1 Cobra, but navigator Ron Arad was captured by members of the Shi'a Amal Movement. Initial negotiations for an exchange of prisoners failed and Arad has been missing since and his fate remains unknown.Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 173‚Äì178. In early 1986 the squadron introduced the AGM-142 Popeye into IAF service, and for nearly a decade was the only IAF squadron to operate the missile. In 1987 its Phantoms played the role of Soviet \\"MiG-29s\\" in the film \\"Iron Eagle II\\". Filming coincided with the receipt of several birds from 105 Squadron, which appropriately appeared in the film bearing that unit's distinctive red flash on the fuselage (although the IAF markings were replaced with the Soviet red star insignia). The squadron trained extensively for possible participation in the 1990 Gulf War, but Israel eventually stayed out of that conflict. In June 1991 the squadron relocated to the air base at Hatzerim, from which it flew 79 sorties during Operation Accountability of April 1993. In the wake of the Oslo Accords the US finally agreed to supply the IAF with the F-15E Strike Eagle, and 69 Squadron was disbanded in early 1994 in expectation of its re-equipment with the new aircraft.Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 176-190. Thunder Squadron F-15I Ra'ams at Red Flag 04-3 Independence Day 2011 Four Israeli airmen, led by future squadron leader Dror Ben-David, travelled to the US in 1997 for the F-15E conversion course, and the first two aircraft landed in Hatzerim on January 19, 1998. 16 aircraft had arrived by January 1, 1999, when the squadron was declared operational, and 10 days later the unit carried out it first operational sorties over southern Lebanon. Deliveries were completed in June 2000, by which time the squadron had taken part in operations in support of the May 2000 Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.Aloni 2006, p. 80.Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 203-208. The squadron has since undertaken numerous missions during the Second Intifada and Operation Cast Lead. During the Second Lebanon War the Hammers flew 1,400 sorties, totalling 2,300 flying hours, more than any other IAF combat unit. During this conflict, the Ra'am's long range and endurance served it well in the close support role, as the aircraft could carry more munitions and remain on station longer than any other strike aircraft. It is these capabilities that place 69 Squadron at the forefront of Israel's strategic arm, and it is thus this unit that is reputed to have undertaken Operation Orchard, the destruction of a Syrian nuclear site on September 6, 2007.Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 219‚Äì221. Squadron explicitly mentioned in attached graphic. The squadron has also been linked to a possible Israeli strike against the Iranian nuclear program. Since its reactivation, the 69 Squadron has also undertaken multiple deployments abroad. It was the first Israeli unit to participate in exercise Red Flag in October 1998, and has taken part in several Red Flags since. It has also deployed to Turkey and Italy on several occasions, and three aircraft participated in the 2001 RAF Waddington International Air Show.Aloni 2006, p. 94.Aloni and Avidror 2010, pp. 209-212.

It is the brightest star in Delphinus. The two components of the system are designated Beta Delphini A (officially named Rotanev , which is historically the name of the system) and B. Nomenclature Œ≤ Delphini (Latinised to Beta Delphini) is the binary's Bayer designation. The designations of the two components as Beta Delphini A and B derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Beta Delpini bore an historical name, Rotanev, which arose as follows: Niccol√≤ Cacciatore was the assistant to Giuseppe Piazzi, and later his successor as Director of the Palermo Observatory. The name first appeared in Piazzi's Palermo Star Catalogue. When the Catalogue was published in 1814, the unfamiliar names Sualocin and Rotanev were attached to Alpha and Beta Delphini, respectively. Eventually the Reverend Thomas Webb, a British astronomer, puzzled out the explanation. Cacciatore's name, Nicholas Hunter in English translation, would be Latinized to Nicolaus Venator. Reversing the letters of this construction produces the two names. They have endured, the result of Cacciatore's little practical joke of naming the two after himself. How Webb arrived at this explanation 45 years after the publication of the catalogue is still a mystery. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. It approved the name Rotanev for the component Beta Delphini A on 12 September 2016 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names. In Chinese, (), meaning Good Gourd, refers to an asterism consisting of Beta Delphini, Alpha Delphini, Gamma2 Delphini, Delta Delphini, and Zeta Delphini. ‰∏≠ÂúãÊòüÂ∫ßÁ•ûË©±, written by Èô≥‰πÖÈáë.

The system consists of a pair of F-type stars that orbit each other with a period of 26.66 years and an eccentricity of 0.36. The plane of the orbit is inclined by an angle of 61¬∞ to the line of sight from the Earth. The two stars have an angular separation of about 0.44 arcseconds, making them a challenge to resolve with a telescope. The larger member of the pair is a giant star with 1.75 times the mass and 24 times the luminosity of the Sun, while the secondary component is a subgiant star that has 1.47 times the Sun's mass and around 8 times the Sun's luminosity. The system is around 1.8 billion years old.

It consists of a binary star, designated Alpha Delphini A, together with five faint, probably optical companions, designated Alpha Delphini B, C, D, E and F. A's two components are themselves designated Alpha Delphini Aa (officially named Sualocin , the historical name for the entire system) and Ab. Nomenclature Œ± Delphini (Latinised to Alpha Delphini) is the system's Bayer designation. The designations of the six constituents as Alpha Delphini A to F, and those of A's components - Alpha Delphini Aa and Ab - derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The system bore an historical name, Sualocin, which arose as follows: Niccol√≤ Cacciatore was the assistant to Giuseppe Piazzi, and later his successor as Director of the Palermo Observatory. The name first appeared in Piazzi's Palermo Star Catalogue. When the Catalogue was published in 1814, the unfamiliar names Sualocin and Rotanev were attached to Alpha and Beta Delphini, respectively. Eventually the Reverend Thomas Webb, a British astronomer, puzzled out the explanation. Cacciatore's name, Nicholas Hunter in English translation, would be Latinized to Nicolaus Venator. Reversing the letters of this construction produces the two star names. They have endured, the result of Cacciatore's little practical joke of naming the two stars after himself. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. It approved the name Sualocin for the component Alpha Delphini Aa on 12 September 2016 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names. In Chinese, (), meaning Good Gourd, refers to an asterism consisting of Alpha Delphini, Gamma2 Delphini, Delta Delphini, Beta Delphini and Zeta Delphini. Consequently, the Chinese name for Alpha Delphini itself is (, ). In Hindu astronomy, the star corresponded to one of the nakshatras named Dhanishta.  Properties  Alpha Delphini A is a spectroscopic binary star which has now been resolved using speckle interferometry. The components are separated by 0.2\\" and have a 17-year orbit. Alpha Delphini Aa has a spectral type of B9IV. The spectral type of the secondary star cannot be determined as it is too close and too faint compared to the primary, and its other properties are also unknown. The primary is a subgiant that has begun to evolve away from the main sequence. It is 2.82 times as massive as the sun and about twice as hot. The five faint companions have visual magnitudes around 11th to 13th magnitude and separations of 35\\" to 72\\". They all show motion relative to Alpha Delphini A.

Early life Kov√°ƒç was born in the village of ƒΩubi≈°a in then Czechoslovakia in 1930. He graduated from the present-day University of Economics in Bratislava and was a bank employee of the St√°tn√≠ banka ƒçeskoslovensk√° and of other banks. As such, he spent some years in London and in Cuba in the 1960s. During the Normalization he was subject to some persecution. Political career During and after the Velvet Revolution, from 12 December 1989 to 17 May 1991 (when he resigned) Kov√°ƒç was the Finance Minister of the Slovak (Socialist) Republic. In early 1991, he was one of the founders and the vice-chairman of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia. As such, he was elected as a deputy to the Federal Assembly of Czechoslovakia in 1990. After the 1992 election he served as the Chairman of the Federal Assembly from 25 June to 31 December 1992. He played an important role in the process of the preparation of the Dissolution of Czechoslovakia. =President (1993‚Äì98)= Kov√°ƒç was elected president by the National Council of Slovakia in February 1993 (because he was a candidate of the biggest parliamentary party‚Äîthe Movement for a Democratic Slovakia) and inaugurated on 2 March 1993. He soon became a strong opponent of Prime Minister Vladim√≠r Meƒçiar and by giving a critical presidential address to parliament in March 1994, Kov√°ƒç significantly contributed to the deposition of the then Meƒçiar government and the creation of the Moravƒç√≠k government (which only lasted until the next parliamentary election in the autumn of 1994). In 1995 the Meƒçiar-Kov√°ƒç conflict intensified and the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia cancelled Kov√°ƒç's (formal) membership in the party. In August 1995 Kov√°ƒç's son, who had been accused of financial crimes by German authorities (the accusation was later withdrawn), was kidnapped and taken to Austria. The president, opposition parties and Austrian court accused the Slovak intelligence service (SIS) and the government of having organized this kidnapping. The investigation of new secret intelligence service director Mitro and Slovak police after collapse of Meciar's regime in the end of 1998 confirmed the participation of the SIS on this kidnap but the Slovak justice rejected the trial with its suspected actors because of an amnesty (also called self-amnesty) issued by Vladimir Meciar on 3 March 1998. Kov√°ƒç's term ended on 2 March 1998. His candidature in the first direct 1999 Slovak presidential election was unsuccessful. He was not very visible in Slovakian politics after this time and appeared only at a few symbolic events. Health and death On 10 July 2008 the Slovak media reported that Kov√°ƒç probably suffered from Parkinson's disease. The former president did not confirm this information but admitted that he had some health problems. On 5 October 2016, Kov√°ƒç died from complications of Parkinson's disease in Bratislava, aged 86.

In an extended flashback narration, it recounts the story of a dancer and an army captain who meet by chance on Waterloo Bridge. The film was made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, directed by Mervyn LeRoy and produced by Sidney Franklin and Mervyn LeRoy. The screenplay is by S. N. Behrman, Hans Rameau and George Froeschel, based on the Broadway drama by Robert E. Sherwood. The music is by Herbert Stothart and cinematography by Joseph Ruttenberg. The film stars Robert Taylor and Vivien Leigh. It was a success at the box office and nominated for two Academy Awards‚ÄîBest Music for Herbert Stothart and Best Cinematography. It was also considered a personal favorite by both Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor. In 1956, it was remade again as Gaby, which starred Leslie Caron and John Kerr. Plot After Britain's declaration of World War II, Roy Cronin (Robert Taylor), an army colonel, is being driven to London's Waterloo station en route to France, and briefly alights on Waterloo Bridge to reminisce about events which occurred during the First World War when he met Myra Lester (Vivien Leigh) whom he had planned to marry. While Roy gazes at a good luck charm, a billiken that she had given him, the story unfolds. Roy, a captain in the Rendleshire Fusiliers on his way to the front, and Myra, a ballerina, serendipitously meet crossing Waterloo Bridge during an air raid, striking up an immediate rapport while taking shelter. Myra invites Roy to attend that evening's ballet performance and an enamored Roy ignores an obligatory dinner with his colonel to do so. Roy sends a note to Myra to join him after the performance, but the note is intercepted by the mistress of the ballet troupe, the tyrannical Madame Olga (Maria Ouspenskaya), who forbids Myra from having any relationship with Roy. They meet anyway at a romantic night spot. Roy has to go to the front immediately and proposes marriage but wartime circumstances thwart them from marrying immediately. Roy assures Myra that his family will look after her while he is away. Madame Olga learns of Myra's disobedience and dismisses her from the troupe along with fellow dancer Kitty (Virginia Field) when she scolds Madame for spoiling Myra's happiness. The young women share a small flat and look for work. Myra and Roy's mother, Lady Margaret Cronin (Lucile Watson), arrange to meet, their first introduction to each other. Awaiting Lady Margaret's belated arrival at a tea room, Myra scans a newspaper and faints on finding Roy listed among the war dead. Unhappily, the dazed Myra is taking a long drink of brandy just as Lady Margaret appears. Unable to disclose the dreadful news, her banal and incoherent conversation shocks her prospective mother-in-law, who withdraws without seeking an explanation. Myra falls ill with grief and to cover all their expenses, Kitty becomes a streetwalker. Belatedly, Myra, who believed that Kitty was working as a stage performer, learns what her friend has done. Feeling that she has alienated Lady Margaret and having no desire to live, the heartbroken Myra joins her friend Kitty as a prostitute to support them both. A year passes. While offering herself to soldiers on leave arriving at Waterloo station, Myra catches sight of Roy, who is alive and well; he had been wounded and held as a prisoner of war. A reconciliation occurs‚Äîa joyous one for Roy, a bittersweet one for Myra. The couple travels to the family estate in Scotland to visit Lady Margaret, who deduces the misunderstanding that occurred at the tea room. Myra is also accepted by Roy's uncle, the Duke (C. Aubrey Smith), but he inadvertently feeds her guilt with assertions that she would never bring shame to the family. Confronted by the impossibility of a happy marriage, breaking off the engagement seems her only choice. Myra discloses the truth to a compassionate Lady Margaret but is unable to believe herself worthy of marrying Roy. Myra leaves behind a goodbye note and returns to London. Roy follows, and with the aid of Kitty, looks for her despite discovering the truth in the process. Myra, depressed and returning to the Waterloo Bridge, takes her own life by walking into the path of a moving truck. In the present, the older Roy reminisces about Myra's sincere final profession of love only for him. He tucks the charm into his coat pocket, gets into his car, and leaves.

From its initial release, the 1931 film had been censored in major American cities because of official objections to the portrayal of prostitution. The censorship was imposed first by local authorities, e.g., a Chicago police censorship board, before enforcement by the Hays Office in 1934 made it impossible to exhibit the film anywhere in the United States. Because of the Motion Picture Production Code, which had not been in effect when the 1931 film version was made, plot details of the 1940 version were significantly changed and somewhat sanitized. In the original play and film, based on Sherwood's personal experiences, both characters are Americans, Myra an out- of-work chorus girl who has turned to prostitution and Roy a callow 19-year- old expatriate who does not realize what she is. In the 1940 version both are British, Myra a promising ballerina in a prestigious dance company who becomes a prostitute only after believing that her sweetheart has been killed, and Roy a mature officer of Scottish nobility. In the original film, Myra is accidentally killed after her situation with Roy has apparently been happily resolved; in the 1940 version, she commits suicide when her inner conflict becomes insoluble.Walker 1987, p. 138. The flashback format of the later version was a device added in acknowledgment of the recent onset of war when the script was written in 1939. Waterloo Bridge capitalized on Leigh's success the previous year in Gone with the Wind. Taylor, meanwhile, was eager to show audiences that he was more than the suave and youthful lover he had played in such films as Camille and Three Comrades. Leigh wanted Laurence Olivier for the role of Roy Cronin, and was unhappy that Taylor had been cast in the part, although she had enjoyed him on the set of A Yank at Oxford.Taylor 1984, p. 76. She wrote to then-husband Leigh Holman, \\"Robert Taylor is the man in the picture, and as it was written for Larry, it's a typical piece of miscasting. I am afraid it will be a dreary job ...\\" Taylor later said of his performance, \\"It was the first time I really gave a performance that met the often unattainable standards I was always setting for myself.\\" Of Leigh, Taylor said, \\"Miss Leigh was simply great in her role, and she made me look better.\\" Of all her films, Leigh stated this one was her favorite.Bean 2013, p. 71. Taylor also felt this to be his personal favorite. Ethel Griffies and Rita Carlisle (then Carlyle), cast respectively in the 1931 film as Myra's landlady and a woman on the bridge when they meet, appear in the 1940 version in similar roles. Reception Waterloo Bridge opened in New York and shortly after in London to positive reviews.Capus 2003, p. 71. \\"It owed much to the dialogue of Robert E. Sherwood's original play, and to good, shrewd screen directing.\\"Vickers 1988, p. 123. The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2002: AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions ‚Äì Nominated When the film was released in China in November 1940, it was hugely popular. The story became a standard of Shanghai opera and the song \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" became widely known in China. Box office According to MGM records, the film earned $1,250,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $1,217,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $491,000. Radio adaptations Waterloo Bridge was dramatized as a half-hour radio play on two broadcasts of The Screen Guild Theater, the first on January 12, 1941 with Brian Aherne and Joan Fontaine and the second on September 9, 1946 with Barbara Stanwyck and Robert Taylor. It was also presented as a half-hour broadcast of Screen Directors Playhouse on September 28, 1951 with Norma Shearer. References Notes Citations Bibliography * Bean, Kendra.

The association has about 1500 members, representing both salaried and freelance editors, who work with individuals and organizations in the corporate, technical, government, not- for-profit, and publishing sectors. Six regional branches‚ÄîBritish Columbia, Prairie Provinces, Saskatchewan, Toronto, National Capital Region, and Quebec/Atlantic Canada‚Äîprovide a range of local programming and services. Several smaller branches, or 'twigs', also offer local services to members: Calgary, Kitchener-Waterloo-Guelph, Hamilton-Halton, Kingston, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland & Labrador. Editors Canada sponsors professional development seminars, promotes and maintains high standards of editing and publishing in Canada, creates guidelines to help editors secure fair pay and good working conditions, helps both in-house and freelance editors to network, and cooperates with other publishing associations in areas of common concern. The association is incorporated federally as a not-for-profit organization and is governed at the national level by an executive council.  History  In the late 1970s, several young Toronto editors began talking about their shared problems and goals, and by May 1979 the Freelance Editors' Association of Canada (FEAC) had been officially launched. There were approximately 50 people involved, with Maggie MacDonald serving as the association's first president. Within the first year, the association had a logo, a constitution, and a directory. By 1981 Ottawa was hosting a group; three years later Montreal formed a committee; and in 1985 British Columbia did the same. However, until 1990, FEAC operated as a Toronto-based organization. During 1990 and 1991, a new national structure with four separate regional branches was established. The branches were Quebec-Atlantic Canada, National Capital Region, Toronto, and Western Canada (which was essentially BC). In 1982, FEAC adopted a French name, Association canadienne des pigistes de l'edition, and thus committed to being a bilingual association. During the first 15 years of its existence, FEAC addressed primarily issues that were uniquely of concern to freelance editors. However, over the years that emphasis had gradually changed. So in 1994 the association's name was changed to the Editors' Association of Canada/Association canadienne des r√©dacteurs-r√©viseurs, and in-house editors were invited to join. In 1996, the Editors' Association of Alberta came under the umbrella of EAC, becoming the Prairie Provinces Branch. And in 2005, a group of editors in Saskatchewan formed a sixth branch, Saskatoon (later renamed \\"Saskatchewan\\").

Neil Schulman intended to articulate the principles of Agorism, a political philosophy created by Samuel Edward Konkin III, to whom Schulman dedicated the work. It was first published during 1979 by Crown Publishers, with subsequent paperback editions released by Ace Books during 1982, Avon Books during 1987, Pulpless.com during 1999, and Amazon Kindle during 2009. Ross Ulbricht attributed his inspiration for creating the online marketplace Silk Road as \\"'Alongside Night' and the works of Samuel Edward Konkin III.\\" \\"Alongside Night\\" was released as a feature movie by Stonegait Pictures, Braeburn Entertainment, and Jesulu Productions. and is in theatrical distribution via TUGG.com as well as being for sale on Amazon.com as a streaming video and as a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack. A new movie tie-in edition of the novel was released by Pulpless.com in 2013 as both a trade paperback and a Kindle edition, and an Unabridged Audible.com audio book edition is linked from the Amazon.com catalog page. Also released in 2013 is J. Neil Schulman's Alongside Night‚ÄîThe Graphic Novel, based on Schulman's movie screenplay. The novel received endorsements from Anthony Burgess and Milton Friedman and was entered into the Libertarian Futurist Society's Prometheus Hall of Fame in 1989. Plot The story begins with the United States collapsing economically ‚Äî bankers inflating the money supply, the government agents struggling to keep their power. Trading in foreign currency is illegal. Businesses are subject to rationing. As a result, there is a growing black market for everything. It's the world as Samuel Edward Konkin III conceived it prior to a successful agorist revolution. Elliot Vreeland, son of Nobel Laureate Austrian School economist Dr. Martin Vreeland, learns of his father's apparent death, and is rushed home from school. But the death is fake, a plot concocted by his father to escape arrest by the government agents who are detaining \\"radicals\\" accused of worsening the economic crisis. Elliot is sent by his father to collect some gold coins stored in case the family has to escape. Upon his return home, Elliot finds his family missing. Government agents enter the house searching for Elliot, who manages to escape. Elliot becomes acquainted with the Revolutionary Agorist Cadre, an organization plotting the end of the government agents by means of counter-economics. The cadre is strong and organized, and has its militia. Elliot enlists their help, and meets Lorimer, a girl hiding from the government agents; they develop a relationship. As the government agents weaken, they tighten controls on communication, travel, and trade. This fails to avert economic collapse, causing the private sector ‚Äî unions, syndicates, and many unorganized individuals ‚Äî to control the old infrastructure. The 2013 graphic novel and 2014 movie update the book's plot with current references and technology. The location changes from New York city to Las Vegas. Film In 2013 J. Neil Schulman completed production on a feature-film of Alongside Night, starring Kevin Sorbo, Jake Busey, Tim Russ, Garrett Wang, Mara Marini, and Gary Graham. The film premiered July 14, 2014 at the Laemmle Music Hall in Beverly Hills, California, played in limited theatrical release from Tugg.com, released for streaming on iTunes in 2014, was released July 8, 2015 as a Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack, and released in 2015 for streaming on Amazon Video and Amazon Prime.

It was written by Robert Farrar and directed by Rose Troche, starring Kevin McKidd, James Purefoy, Tom Hollander, Julie Graham, Simon Callow and Hugo Weaving. Plot The film opens as Leo (Kevin McKidd), an openly gay man celebrating his 30th birthday, arrives home and is very unhappy to find a surprise-party organised by his roommates Darren (Tom Hollander) and Angie (Julie Graham) in full swing. Leo has a complicated personal history with some of the guests and hides in his bedroom, feeling grumpy and old. The film then goes into an extended flashback which explains this history. It turns out that his brother Adam (Christopher Fulford) had encouraged Leo to attend his weekly men's group run by New Age-type goofball Keith (Simon Callow) whose wife is Sybil (Harriet Walter). There, Leo meets hunky Irishman Brendan (James Purefoy) whom he develops a crush on, which he reluctantly reveals to the group. However Brendan is straight and lives with his ex-girlfriend Sally (Jennifer Ehle) who is later revealed to be Leo's high school sweetheart. A series of 'Iron John' group exercises leads Brendan and Leo to develop a friendship. As they bond, it becomes clear that Brendan's curiosity towards Leo starts to grow in a sexual escalade. In the men's group, one of the other groupsmen become very jealous of Leo's \\"friendship\\" with Brendan and that he does not have that with Leo. Brendan fights with the lad over Leo. The friendship is soon to become more, as Brendan appears unexpectedly late one night at Leo's door and sleeps with him; after which they become something of a couple, to the consternation of one man in their men's group, though it encourages another, Terry (Con O'Neill), to explore his sexuality. Meanwhile, flamboyant Darren has met real estate agent Jeremy (Hugo Weaving), who gets a kick out of having sex in houses for sale he has been given the keys to. However, he is not interested into \\"couply\\" things, despite Darren's attempts. Eventually this leads to them having sex with handcuffs and blindfolds in the bedroom of the house which Sally has on the market, during which she unexpectedly returns home. Jeremy abandons Darren, who dumps him. Leo gets close once more with Sally, and ends up kissing her. Feeling guilty, he leaves in a panic, and ends up telling Brendan what happened, who goes ballistic as he still has feelings for Sally. Leo finds himself in a quandary, and decides to confess to Sally that he is the one who is seeing Brendan (Sally had previously believed it was Leo's roommate Angie). He inadvertently does so while Brendan is there too, and leaves Brendan to face Sally. The film then returns to the party, where Brendan and Terry get into an argument over Leo and take it outside, where Brendan punches Terry on the nose, who crumples. Brendan asks him to go with him for a drink (the same tactic he had employed with Leo). Thus, Brendan starts dating; Leo's brother Adam and Angie get together; Jeremy and Darren make up; and Leo sleeps with Sally. Cast * Kevin McKidd as Leo * Julie Graham as Angie * Simon Callow as Keith * Con O'Neill as Terry * Harriet Walter as Sybil * Christopher Fulford as Adam * James Purefoy as Brendan * Jennifer Ehle as Sally * Tom Hollander as Darren * Hugo Weaving as Jeremy * Paul Higgins as John The film is notable for bringing together a number of actors on the cusp of breaking out into high-profile careers. McKidd became a leading man in films such as Topsy-Turvy, Anna Karenina (2000) on PBS, Nicholas Nickleby, De-Lovely, HBO's mini-series, Rome, and ABC's Grey's Anatomy. Purefoy, too, received starring roles in Mansfield Park (1999), Resident Evil (2002), Vanity Fair (2004) and as Marc Antony in Rome. Tom Hollander broke through in 2001 in Gosford Park, followed by nominated performances in Cambridge Spies, The Libertine, and Pride & Prejudice. He is probably best known, however, for portraying the villainous Cutler Beckett in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. Hugo Weaving had already become well known after his role in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert in 1994 and Babe in 1995 (as Rex the Sheepdog). The year after Bedrooms and Hallways debuted, he became even better known through significant roles in The Matrix film and The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, some of the top-grossing film series of all time.

He is perhaps best known for his work on the Cosmic Africa project that attempts to reconcile science and myth.Reardon, C. African Stars in Ford Foundation Report, Winter 2004 accessed at March 29, 2007.Schieb, R. Cosmic Africa (Documentary - South Africa) (review) in Variety (magazine) Nov 18, 2003 accessed at March 29, 2007. Biography Thebe Medupe, born in 1973, grew up in a poor village outside Mmabatho, without electricity, lights or television, where he sat near the fire under the African sky, listening to the elders tell traditional Setswana stories. His family made sacrifices to send him to a fine, modern high school in Mmabatho, where science and mathematics captured his imagination. Halley's comet inspired Medupe to build a crude telescope with a cardboard tube and lenses donated by a school lab technician, at the age of 13. On an unforgettable chilly, windy night, he pointed his telescope at the moon, and found himself looking at mountains, plains and craters on another world. At the age of 17 in 1990, Medupe won a Science Olympiad and was awarded a trip to England to visit the science institutions, which was the first time he had been outside Africa. He told Black Britain: \\"I made sure I went to the Greenwich observatory where I saw a working telescope for the very first time. It increased my motivation to become a scientist.\\" From that point Medupe became more interested in maths and science and read more widely. On completing school he won a scholarship to study at the University of Cape Town. There he took a first degree in physics and a masters and doctorate in astrophysics. On leaving university, Medupe's first role was as a research fellow at the University of Cape Town. However, he asked the director of the observatory to allow him to return to his home town to try to get some of the young black South Africans into astronomy. He said: \\"Part of my reason for wanting to do that was my annoyance at people telling me that black South Africans were not interested in astronomy.\\" Medupe received his doctorate in astronomy from the University of Cape Town for a thesis that studied the oscillations in stellar atmospheres. In particular, he investigated the interaction of radiative transfer and pulsations in the atmospheres of stars by solving non-adiabatic pulsation equations. He works as a researcher at SAAO and as a lecturer at the University of Cape Town. His other interests involve a study of African ethno-astronomy with a view to use this to attract black students into astronomy and science in general. Within the first year nine young hopefuls were involved in research projects that he was conducting. Medupe is also involved in the National Astrophysics and Space Science Programme which aims to get young people into master's science programmes in astrophysics. Medupe said that the problem of how to get young black children interested in science and technology is one that affects black people on the continent or in the diaspora generally. =Cultural Astronomy Research= Medupe is a principal investigator on a South Africa led collaboration with Mali to digitize and analyze science documents found in the Timbuktu Libraries. Cosmic Africa Medupe worked with filmmakers Craig and Damon Foster (known for their award winning The Great Dance), together with project originator Anne Rogers and her co-worker Carina Rubin of Aland Pictures, to produce a panorama of Africa's mythic and practical interaction with the cosmos. To sample the richness of African traditions and achievements, Medupe and the filmmakers travelled around South Africa and to Mali, Egypt and Namibia, learning from the local people and sharing modern perspectives.

Pressure is applied to the top and the tool is rotated with a U-shaped grip. Bits used come in a variety of types but the more commonly used Ridgeway- and Irwin- pattern bits also rely on a snail point (called the snail), which is a tapered screw point shaped the same as a wood screw thread, which helps to pull the bit into the wood as the user turns the brace handle and applies pressure The U-shaped part is a kind of crank. It gives the brace much greater torque than other kinds of hand-powered drills. A brace and bit can be used to drill much wider and deeper holes than can a geared hand-powered drill. The price of the greater torque is lower rotational speed; it is easy for a geared hand drill to achieve a rotational speed of several hundred revolutions per minute, but it requires considerable effort to achieve even 100 rpm with a brace. The front part of the brace consists of a chuck spindle with V-shaped brackets or clamps inside. Turning the spindle of the chuck in a clockwise direction tightens the drill bit in the chuck and turning in a counter-clockwise direction loosens the bit for removal. A carpenter using a brace In most modern braces, immediately behind the chuck is a three position gear release which allows ratcheting of the handle when in tight spots. Turning the gear release from the center position allows ratcheting the brace in the direction needed. Turning the gear release fully clockwise lets it remove wood in a clockwise direction with the ratchet action going counter-clockwise. Placing the gear release fully counter-clockwise then allows turning the brace and bit in a counter-clockwise direction, usually to remove the drill bit from the hole. The center position of the gear release prohibits the ratcheting effect. The U-shaped crank has a wooden spindle on it and‚Äîalong with the top spindle‚Äîis allowed to freely turn under the hands without producing wear and tear on the hands (thus, no blisters). The earliest carpenter's braces equipped with a U-shaped grip, that is with a compound crank, appeared between 1420 and 1430 in Flanders. The brace has other names too. Bit brace is the most commonly used name, but Carpenter's brace, ratchet brace (if indeed a ratchet mechanism is part of the particular brace) and swing brace are also commonly used too. See also Hand drills for some related tools, including the type sometimes known as a wheel brace.

District boundaries include the city and villages of Elgin, South Elgin, Bartlett, Streamwood, and Hoffman Estates. The library is a member of Reaching Across Illinois Library System, one of two multitype regional library systems in Illinois. History The library was named in honor of Gail Borden (November 9, 1801 - January 11, 1874), who in 1856 invented condensed milk. Gail Borden never lived in Elgin or donated any funds for the library which bears his name, but in 1892, his step sons, Samuel and Alfred Church, residents of Elgin, purchased and donated the Scofield Mansion at 50 N. Spring Street to house the new library. Their only request was that the library be forever and always known and called the Gail Borden Public Library. The library remained at the 50 Spring Street location until the late 1960s when the weight of the books was beginning to strain the ability of the building to hold them all. A new library was built at the Corner of Kimball and Grove, and the library was moved. In 1975/76, the children's department was renovated. Renovations included a climbing play structure with a slide and windows to peek from, an aquarium and a mini zoo with lizards and other interesting creatures. Led by the Children's Librarian, Mary Greenawalt, this was one of the first libraries to incorporate play structures into the library experience. The population began to overwhelm the library resources leading to plans for the new building, which opened in 2003. The library today In October 2003, the library moved into a new facility just across the street from the old library at a cost of $29.8 million.https://gailborden.info/about- the-library The new library is situated along the eastern shore of the Fox River and includes a shelving capacity of 460,000 volumes. The architects, Frye Gillan Molinaro Architects, Ltd, designed the library to accommodate the expected growth in population from 110,000 in 2004 to 165,000 over the next 20 years. The library, a two-story structure is clad in warm buff and terra cotta-colored stone and inspired by the late 19th and early 20th century architectural Prairie School style, illustrated by Frank Lloyd Wright and others. In 2009, the Gail Borden Public Library District received the National Medal for Museum and Library Service. This is the highest honor awarded for libraries and museums recognizing their service and contributions within their community. For the first time in its 135 year history, the Gail Borden Public Library District opened its first branch. The Rakow Branch Library opened its doors on August 15, 2009.https://gailborden.info/about-the-library/rakow- branch/rakow-branch-history Designed by architectural firm Engberg Anderson Design Partnership, the building features a popular materials collection, a computer cafe, a zen garden and natural prairie plantings as well as a living room area with fireplace. The building earned gold LEED certification (Leadership in Environmental Energy and Design) due to the numerous environmentally friendly and sustainable features including a geothermal well system for heating and cooling the facility. On July 24, 2016, the long awaited South Elgin Branch was added to the Gail Borden Library District, expanding it to a total of three buildings. The building was donated by the Hoffer Foundation, and part of the constructions costs were offset with money provided by South Elgin. The branch is a 4,275 sq foot building, located at 127 S.

Biography As a child, he lived at Goldsborough Hall in Goldsborough, North Yorkshire, which was the house for the heirs-in-waiting for Harewood House. During his lifetime the Lascelles family were still major landholders in Barbados. He initially served in the regular army as captain in the Grenadier Guards, after which he served part-time as an officer in the Yorkshire Hussars Yeomanry, which became part of the Territorial Army in 1908. He was lieutenant-colonel in command of that regiment from 1881 to 1898 and honorary colonel from 1898 to 1913. His long service with the yeomanry brought him the Territorial Decoration (T.D.) in 1909. He also held the post of colonel and yeomanry aide-de-campe to Queen Victoria from 1897, Edward VII throughout the latter's reign, and to George V from 1910 until his own death. He succeeded to titles of Earl of Harewood, Viscount Lascelles, and Baron Harewood on 24 June 1892. He was a Deputy Lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire on 26 February 1900, and Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire on 22 April 1904, serving as such until 14 December 1927.

It is a member of a group of spiders known as Australian funnel-web spiders. Its bite is capable of causing serious illness or death in humans if left untreated. The Sydney funnel-web has a body length ranging from . Both sexes are glossy and darkly coloured, ranging from blue-black, to black, to shades of brown or dark-plum coloured. Taxonomy Female Sydney funnel-web spider in a warning posture The Rev. Octavius Pickard-Cambridge was the first to describe the Sydney funnel-web spider, from a female specimen housed in the British Museum in 1877. Establishing the genus Atrax, he named it Atrax robustus. The species name is derived from the Latin robustus, \\"strong/sturdy/mature\\". Some years later, William Joseph Rainbow described a male Sydney funnel-web as a new species‚ÄîEuctimena tibialis‚Äîfrom a spider he found under a log in Turramurra, and another from Mosman. He coined the scientific name from Ancient Greek euktimenos, \\"well-built\\", and Latin tibialis, \\"of the tibia\\", having noted its prominent tibial spur. In the same paper, he described a female Sydney funnel-web spider as yet another species‚ÄîPoikilomorpha montana‚Äîfrom a specimen collected from Jamison Valley and Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains. Its species name was derived from poikilomorphia, \\"variety of form\\", referring to the eyes of different sizes, and montana, \\"of the mountains\\". In February 1927, a young boy died after being bitten on the hand after playing with a big black spider on the laundry steps of his home in the Sydney suburb of Thornleigh. He fell gravely ill and perished later that evening. Public interest in the spiders surged, and the police brought the dead spider to the Australian Museum, where Anthony Musgrave identified the creature as Euctimena tibialis. He examined a series of male and female spiders collected around Sydney and concluded based on anatomical similarities that Euctimena tibialis was the male Atrax robustus. Poikilomorpha montana was classified as the same species in 1988. , Atrax robustus is one of three species of the genus Atrax in the family Atracidae. The Sydney funnel-web spider shares its name with some members of the genus Hadronyche. It remains, together with the northern tree-dwelling funnel-web, the only two species of Australian funnel-web spider known to have inflicted fatal bites on humans. Description Male funnel-web, McMasters Beach The Sydney funnel-web is medium to large in size, with body length ranging from . Both sexes are glossy and darkly coloured, ranging from blue-black, to black, to brown or dark-plum coloured. The carapace covering the cephalothorax is almost hairless and appears smooth and glossy. Another characteristic are finger-like spinnerets at the end of their abdomen. The shorter-lived male is smaller than the female, but longer-legged.\\"Funnel-web spider\\" , CSIRO, 14.10.2011. Retrieved 18 December 2011. The average leg length for the spider in general is six to seven centimeters. Distribution and habitat Distribution is centred on Sydney, extending north to the Central Coast and south to the Illawarra region, and west to the Blue Mountains in New South Wales. The spider can be found in moist microhabitats, including under logs and foliage. Sydney funnel-web spiders are mostly terrestrial spiders, favouring habitats with moist sand and clays. Behaviour They typically build silk-lined tubular burrow retreats with collapsed \\"tunnels\\" or open \\"funnel\\" entrances from which irregular trip-lines radiate over the ground. In some exceptions, which lack trip-lines but may have trapdoors, the silk entrance tube may be split into two openings, in a Y or T form. The spiders burrow in sheltered habitats where they can find a moist and humid climate; for instance under rocks, logs or borer holes in rough-barked trees.Sydney Funnel-web Spider, Atrax robustus, Australian Museum, Sydney. Retrieved 18 December 2011. The long-lived female funnel-web spend most of the time in their silk-lined tubular burrow retreats. When potential prey, which includes insects, lizards or frogs, walks across the trip-lines, they rush out, subduing their prey by injecting their venom. Males, recognized by the modified terminal segment of the palp, tend to wander during the warmer months of the year, looking for receptive females to mate with. This makes encounters with male specimens more likely as they sometimes wander into backyards or houses, or fall into swimming pools. The spiders can survive such immersion for up to twenty-four hours, trapping air bubbles on hairs around their abdomen. Sydney funnel-web spiders are mainly active at night, as typical day- time conditions would dehydrate them. During the day, they seek cover in cool, moist hideaways. After heavy rain, spider activity is increased as their burrows may be flooded. When threatened or provoked, funnel-web spiders will display aggressive behaviour, rearing up on their hind legs and displaying their fangs.\\"Australian Spider and Insect Bites\\", University of Sydney. Retrieved 18 December 2011. When biting, the funnel-web spider maintains a tight grip on its victim, often biting repeatedly. Bites to humansVenom= The lethal dose of venom in humans is not known. The lethal dose of venom from male Sydney funnel-web spiders for the crab-eating macaque (Macaca fascicularis) is . Higher figures were found for other experimental animals, such as for two-day-old mice. The average venom yield for a male is . Guinness World Records has ranked the Sydney funnel-web spider as the world's most venomous spider, defining the term \\"most venomous\\" as \\"having the venom most toxic to humans\\", although it has also given this title to the Brazilian wandering spider. Sydney funnel-web spider venom contains a compound known as Œ¥-atracotoxin, an ion channel inhibitor, which makes the venom highly toxic for humans and other primates. However, it does not affect the nervous system of other mammals. These spiders typically deliver a full envenomation when they bite, often striking repeatedly, due to their defensiveness and large chitinous cheliceral fangs. There has been no reported case of severe envenoming by female Sydney funnel-web spiders, which is consistent with the finding that the venom of female specimens is less potent than the venom of their male counterparts. In the case of severe envenomation, the time to onset of symptoms is less than one hour, with a study about Sydney funnel-web spider bites finding a median time of 28 minutes. This same study revealed that children are at particular risk of severe Sydney funnel-web spider envenoming, with 42% of all cases of severe envenoming being children. There is at least one recorded case of a small child dying within 15 minutes of a bite from a funnel-web. =Symptoms= The bite of a Sydney funnel-web is initially very painful, with clear fang marks separated by several millimetres. The size of fangs is responsible for the initial pain. In some cases the spider will remain attached until dislodged by shaking or flicking it off. Physical symptoms can include copious secretion of saliva, muscular twitching and breathing difficulty, disorientation and confusion, leading to unconsciousness.Spider Bites. St John Ambulance Australia. Retrieved 24 August 2020. =Treatment= A Sydney funnel-web bite is regarded as a medical emergency requiring immediate hospital treatment. Current guidelines for antivenom recommend two vials, or four vials if symptoms of envenomation are severe. Patients are assessed every 15 minutes, with further vials recommended if symptoms do not resolve. The most vials used to treat a bite is 12. The patient was a 10-year-old boy who was bitten in February 2017 by a male Sydney funnel-web that was hiding in a shoe. The antivenom was developed by a team headed by Struan Sutherland at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in Melbourne. Since the antivenom became available in 1981, there have been no recorded fatalities from Sydney funnel-web spider bites., Australian Museum, Sydney. Retrieved 18 December 2011. In September 2012, it was reported that stocks of antivenom were running low, and members of the public were asked to catch the spiders so that they could be milked for their venom. One dose of antivenom requires around 70 milkings from a Sydney funnel-web spider. The Australian Reptile Park receives Sydney funnel-web spiders as part of its milking program. In January 2016, they received a male Sydney funnel-web with a leg span. The spider was described by the park as the largest specimen that it had ever seen.

From about 1852, the term accolade was used much more generally to mean \\"praise\\" or \\"award\\" or \\"honour.\\" Etymology Accolade was first used in 1611 and is French, from the Occitan acolada. This, in turn, came from the Latin ad (\\"to\\") + collum (\\"neck\\") and in Occitan originally meant \\"embrace\\". Accolade is akin to \\"dubbing\\" or \\"to dub\\" since the tap on the shoulder with the knighting sword is accepted to be the point at which the title is awarded. HistoryCeremony= King John II of France in a ceremony of \\"adoubement\\", early 15th century miniature The accolade is a ceremony to confer knighthood. It may take many forms, including the tapping of the flat side of a knighting sword on the shoulders of a candidate (who is himself sometimes referred to as an accolade during the ceremony) or an embrace about the neck. In the first example, the \\"knight- elect\\" kneels in front of the monarch on a knighting-stool. First, the monarch lays the side of the sword's blade onto the accolade's right shoulder. The monarch then raises the sword just up over the apprentice's head, flips it counterclockwise so that the same side of the blade will come in contact with the knight's body, and places it on his left shoulder. The new knight then stands up, and the king or queen presents him with the insignia of his new order. Contrary to popular belief, the phrase \\"Arise, Sir ...\\" is not used. There is some disagreement among historians on the actual ceremony and in what time period certain methods could have been used. It could have been an embrace or a slight blow on the neck or cheek. Gregory of Tours wrote that the early kings of France, in conferring the gilt shoulder-belt, kissed the knights on the left cheek. In knighting his son Henry with the ceremony of the accolade, history records that William the Conqueror used the blow. Francis Drake (left) being knighted by Queen Elizabeth I in 1581. The recipient is tapped on each shoulder with a sword The blow, or col√©e, when first utilized was given with a bare fist, a stout box on the ear. This was later substituted for by a gentle stroke with the flat part of the sword against the side of the neck. This then developed into the custom of tapping on either the right or left shoulder, or both, which is still the tradition in the United Kingdom today. An early Germanic coming-of-age ceremony, of presenting a youth with a weapon that was buckled on him, was elaborated in the 10th and 11th centuries as a sign that the minor had come of age. Initially this was a simple rite often performed on the battlefield, where writers of Romance enjoyed placing it. A panel in the Bayeux Tapestry shows the knighting of Harold by William of Normandy, but the specific gesture is not clearly represented. Another military knight (commander of an army), sufficiently impressed by a warrior's loyalty, would tap a fighting soldier on his back and shoulder with the flat of his sword and announce that he was now an official knight. Some words that might be spoken at that moment were Advances Chevalier au nom de Dieu. In medieval France, early ceremonies of the adoubement were purely secular and indicated a young noble coming of age. Around 1200, these ceremonies began to include elements of Christian ritual (such as a night spent in prayers, prior to the rite ).Dominique Barth√©lemy, L'Ordre seigneurial: XIe - XIIe si√®cle, Collection: Nouvelle histoire de la France moderne, vol. 3, Paris: Editions du Seuil, 1990, p.190. The increasingly impressive ceremonies surrounding adoubement figured largely in the Romance literature, both in French and in Middle English, particularly those set in the Trojan War or around the legendary personage of Alexander the Great.Ackerman, Robert W. \\"The Knighting Ceremonies in the Middle English Romances.\\" Speculum 19(3): July 1944, 285-313, compared the abbreviated historical accounts with the sometimes fancifully elaborated episodes in the romances. =Promotion steps= The process of becoming a knight generally included these stages: *Page - A child started training at the age of 7, he will begin learning about obedience, manners, and other important skills. *Squire - At the age of 14, the young man would observe and help other knights. Occupying a position comparable to an apprenticeship, he managed equipment and weapons such as arrows. He learned the use of weapons while hunting with the knights. He went into recruit training to learn how to become a military fighter. At the age of 21, if judged worthy, he was bestowed the accolade of knighthood. Squires, and even soldiers, could also be conferred direct knighthood early if they showed valor and efficiency for their service; such acts may include deploying for an important quest or mission, or protecting a high diplomat or a royal relative in battle. *Knight - A special kind of trained soldier, often cavalry, serving a lord (nobleman or royalty). Knights had particular status in feudal society.

Properties Position of Œ≥ Aquilae relative to upright Gamma Aquilae is a relatively young star with an age of about 100 million years. Nevertheless, it has reached a stage of its evolution where it has consumed the hydrogen at its core and expanded into what is termed a bright giant star, with a stellar classification of K3 II. The star is now burning helium into carbon in its core. After it has finished generating energy through nuclear fusion, Gamma Aquilae will become a white dwarf. The interferometry-measured angular diameter of Gamma Aquilae is mas, which, at its estimated distance, equates to a physical radius of about 95 times the radius of the Sun. With almost six times the Sun's mass, this is an enormous star that is radiating over times the luminosity of the Sun. An effective temperature of in its outer envelope gives it the orange hue typical of K-type stars.

Sitting with the Progressive Senate Group, she is the first Aboriginal woman appointed to the Senate. As an activist on behalf of First Nations women and children, she received international recognition in 1979 for bringing her case to the United Nations Human Rights Committee. In 1985 she succeeded in having Parliament revoke a discriminatory section of the Indian Act, which had caused women marrying non-Aboriginals to lose status and also deprived their children of status but did not treat men the same who married non-Aboriginal women. Early life and education Mary Sandra Nicholas was born a Maliseet in the Tobique First Nation. She studied at St. Thomas University and also obtained a degree in residential construction from the Northern Technical College in Maine, while living in the United States. As a young woman, she became an activist for aboriginal rights and has also worked as a carpenter. Career The Native women's groups, Indian Rights for Indian Women and National Native Women's Association, had been involved in trying to right the inequity of provisions under the Indian Act that deprived First Nations women and their children from status by marriage to a non-Aboriginal. Men who married non- status women did not suffer the same loss of status. In 1974, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the law. Changes to the law were opposed by some male- dominated First Nations. After being divorced from a non-Aboriginal man and returning to the Tobique reserve, Lovelace Nicholas found she and her children had lost their status as First Nations people, depriving them of rights to housing, education, and healthcare for a decade. In July 1977 she joined with other women on a 100-mile walk to Ottawa to bring attention to the issue. Lovelace Nicholas became known internationally as an activist when, in 1979, she petitioned the United Nations over the treatment of aboriginal women and children in Canada by the government, in the case known as Sandra Lovelace v. Canada (1977‚Äì1981). Among the policies she criticized was revoking the status of a First Nations woman if she married a non-aboriginal man, and denying status to their children. As noted, this had numerous effect, including denying such women equal access to reserve land. It imposed a patriarchal model of identity, depriving married women of their independent rights and status. In addition, as many of the First Nations had matrilineal systems, in which children belonged to the mother's people, the law deprived the children of such marriages of their traditional First Nations identity. In 1985, Lovelace Nicholas was finally successful in her campaign to have the law changed. Parliament passed an amendment to have a 116-year-old section of the Indian Act removed that revoked an aboriginal woman's Indian status if she married a non-Aboriginal man. This protected the status of First Nations women and their children, and was important in preserving the culture of descendants who identified as Aboriginal. In 2005 Lovelace Nicholas was the first Aboriginal woman appointed to the Senate, where she sat as a Liberal. On January 29, 2014, Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau announced all Liberal Senators, including Lovelace Nicholas, were removed from the Liberal caucus, and would continue sitting as Independents.http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/justin-trudeau-removes-senators- from-liberal-caucus-1.2515273 The Senators refer to themselves as the Senate Liberal Caucus even though they are no longer members of the parliamentary Liberal caucus. In April 2018 The Feminist Alliance for International Action recognized Sandra as a member of the Indigenous Famous Six. Other members are Jeannette Corbiere-Lavell, Yvonne Bedard, Sharon McIvor, Lynn Gehl, and Senator Lillian Eva Dyck.https://windspeaker.com/news/windspeaker-news/famous- six-to-be-celebrated-for-work-on-61a-all-the-way With the Senate Liberal Caucus facing losing official parliamentary caucus status in 2020 with a third of its caucus facing mandatory retirements on their turning age 75, Senator Joseph Day announced that the Senate Liberal Caucus had been dissolved and a new Progressive Senate Group formed in its wake, with the entire membership joining the new group, including this senator. Marriage and family In 1970 Lovelace married Bennie Lovelace, a non-Aboriginal, and had one child with him. After they divorced, she moved back to her reserve but found that she and her children were deprived of status rights because of her marriage. This affected her family's housing, health, and education for her children. It took her nearly a decade to reclaim her First Nations status, leading to her work as an activist on this and related issues for women and children's rights. Legacy and honors *1990, Lovelace Nicholas was made a Member of the Order of Canada. *1992, she received one of the annual five Governor General's Awards in Commemoration of the Persons Case, recognizing women's achievements. *2005, she was appointed a senator from New Brunswick by Prime Minister Paul Martin. *2008, she was awarded an honorary degree by St. Francis Xavier University.

The first environmental suits were diving suits designed to protect a diver from the surrounding water (see timeline of underwater technology). Later developments were designed to protect the wearer from the cold (for example wetsuits and other ambient pressure suits) or from undersea high pressure and the resulting decompression sickness (for example atmospheric diving suits). Protecting the wearer from cold is also a feature of ski suits. In aviation, pressure suits protect fighter pilots from hypoxia / altitude sickness, and g-suits from the adverse effects of acceleration (gravity-induced loss of consciousness, or G-LOC). The most extreme environmental suits are used by astronauts to protect them during ascent and while in the vacuum of space: space suits and space activity suits. Such suits are self-supporting, and include a supply of oxygen for the wearer. Environmental suits are also used to protect the wearer from contamination (for example hazmat suits), or conversely to protect the environment from contamination by the wearer (see cleanroom suits).

Orthograde is a term derived from (Greek ·ΩÄœÅŒ∏œåœÇ, orthos (\\"right\\", \\"true\\", \\"straight\\") + Latin gradi (to walk)] that describes a manner of walking which is upright, with the independent motion of limbs. Both New and Old World monkeys are primarily arboreal, and they have a tendency to walk with their limbs swinging in parallel to one another. This differs from the manner of walking demonstrated by the apes. Chimpanzees, gorillas, and humans, when walking, walk upright, and their limbs swing in opposition to one another for balance (unlike monkeys, apes lack a tail to use for balance). Disadvantages related to upright walking do exist for primates, since their primary mode of locomotion is quadrupedalism. This upright locomotion is called \\"orthograde posture\\". Orthograde posture in humans was made possible through millions of years of evolution. In order to walk upright with maximum efficiency, the skull, spine, pelvis, lower limbs, and feet all underwent evolutionary changes.  Origin  The definition of orthograde posture can easily be derived from its roots ‚Äúortho-‚Äù meaning ‚Äúupright‚Äù and ‚Äú-grade‚Äù meaning ‚Äúascent.‚Äù This was true for the early hominidae, whose transition to upright walking took place approximately six to seven million years ago evident in orrorin tugenensis. These hominin were some of the first bipeds who propagated forward one leg at a time, step by step.  Evolutionary significance  The first definitive evidence of habitual orthograde posture in human evolutionary lineage begins with Ardipithecus ramidus, dating between 5.2 to 5.8 million years ago. The skeletal remains of this hominid exhibit a mosaic of morphological characteristics that would have been both adapted to an arboreal environment and walking upright terrestrially. The earliest evidence of a hominid exhibiting skeletal morphology capable of achieving orthograde posture dates to 9.5 million years ago, with the discovery of a Miocene ape, Dryopithecus in Can Llobateres, Spain. Several million years after Orrorin tugenensis, australopithecines such as Au. africanus and Au. afarensis also practiced habitual bipedalism. These tree-dwellers were arboreal and inhabited the wooded areas of forest canopies. Some hominin in that time period still used knuckle walking, a practice common in other apes. However habitual bipedalism in australopiths meant though they nested among the branches in trees at night, they moved with orthograde posture such that their hands could also be used for gathering, feeding, weight transfer, or balance during the day. From fossil evidence and hypotheses state that upright posture was a quintessential reaction to changes in environment and competition. Due to the more wooded barren savannahs of northern Africa, O. tugenensis and australopiths began to change, which is evident in morphological data accumulated from the remains of the different species. These major morphological changes differentiate them from pronograde hominin seen in the skull, vertebral column, pelvis, and femur fossils.  Morphological characteristics  Annotated human shoulder. In order for animals to have the ability to walk upright, there are certain anatomical requirements. For mammals that exhibit orthograde posture, the scapula is more dorsally placed than in animals with a pronograde posture. The scapular index, the measure of width to length of the scapula, is decreased in animals exhibiting orthograde posture. This means that the scapula is broader than it is long. The rib cage is more flattened and the acromion process on the scapula is much larger. This is because there is more of a need for the deltoid muscle in orthograde posture, due to the availability of resource manipulation by the freeing up of hands.  Morphological changes  In 1924, the discovery of remains of the Taung Child in South Africa provided further evidence of bipedalism and orthograde posture. The skull belonged to a three year old child, later identified as Australopithecus africanus. The skull was an indicator of orthograde posture because of the location and orientation of the foramen magnum. The foramen magnum is the space in the skull that acts as the bridge to the central nervous system from the spinal cord to the brain. For animals with \\"pronograde posture, the foramen magnum is dorsally oriented, whereas in humans it is anteriorly located and forwardly inclined. In the Taung Child despite lacking the forward inclination seen in humans, the foramen magnum is also anteriorly oriented. Similarly in Australopithecus afarensis, the site of the space in the skull is even more human-like, inferiorly located such that the spinal cord would run perpendicularly to the ground. Relating this orientation to the encephalization of hominin of the time, the position foramen magnum assisted in balance and supported upright posture. More evidence in hominidae that enabled orthograde posture is present in the vertical column or lumbar vertebra of Australopithecus afarensis. The human lumbar column consists of five vertebrae that connect the twelve thoracic vertebrae to the sacrum and pelvis. Primates with pronograde posture such as gorillas have four lumbar vertebrae that connect to twelve thoracic vertebrae. The difference in vertebra number results in a greater range of movement for humans with less thoracic vertebrae than gorillas with more lumbar vertebrae. Au. afarensis has six total lumbar vertebrae with also twelve thoracic vertebra Another key characteristic that enforced upright posture in hominin was the shape of the lumbar vertebra. The ‚Äús‚Äù shape of the lumbar vertebra is called spinal lordosis, which produces the unique convex curvature seen in upright bipeds. The vertebral column of australopith fossils also share the curved morphology of modern humans. Lordosis in the lower lumbar spine centers the mass of the body on the lower joints such as the pelvis and femur such that the body is self-stabilizing and can remain upright. The earliest habitual bipeds of the hominins were Orrorin tungenenisis. Evidence draws from three femur fragments, including the left shaft and head, and the head of the right femur. Linking the legs to the pelvis and lumbar vertebra, the femur quintessentially supports body weight as it is transferred from the pelvis to the knee and lower limbs. The femoral neck specifically, which connects the head of the femur to its primary shaft absorbs the force of impact when an upright biped assumes movement. In Orrorin tugenensis, the orientation of the head condyles of the broadened femur is wider and thicker in comparison to that of chimpanzees and other great apes.

Some critics of regulation through litigation cite the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers, arguing that rules that govern society as a whole should be rooted solely in laws enacted by legislative bodies. By corollary, the judicial and executive branches should properly be limited in their powers with regard to the law: the judicial in interpreting the laws, and the executive in enforcing the laws. Critics of regulation through litigation include members of industry and public-service professions; some would argue that as potential defendants, their opposition is based more in self-interest than in policy concerns. Of particular concern to critics is the use of the attorney general office to make policy, especially when that policy contradicts the policy of the chief executive; for example, many criticized Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood for his litigation against insurance companies in the wake of Hurricane Katrina on the grounds that it undid the efforts of Governor Haley Barbour to improve the business environment in the state. In another example, eight state attorneys general unsuccessfully sued utility companies in an attempt to force implementation of global warming standards that the federal government has refused to adopt. There are sometimes legislative efforts to prevent regulation through litigation. Rep. Rick Boucher (D-VA) argued in support of a 2005 federal tort reform that gave immunity to gun manufacturers in certain lawsuits because such lawsuits were \\"nothing more than thinly veiled attempts to circumvent the legislative process and achieve gun control through litigation\\"; reform supporters complained that (and the Pentagon supported the bill on the grounds that) the plaintiffs were trying to \\"sue [gun manufacturers] out of existence\\" through forcing them to incur $250 million in legal defense expenses, while gun control supporters argued that the legislation took away \\"...the right of victims to be able to have their day in court,\\" that the bill gave unprecedented immunity to a single industry, and that the law was unconstitutional. Some use the term \\"regulation through litigation\\" in a favorable sense. For example, some laws have \\"private attorney general\\" provisions that permit individuals to file suit in court to vindicate important rights. Many laws for addressing consumer protection, civil rights and employment discrimination provide incentives for the private enforcement of laws by allowing the prevailing party to recover a reasonable attorney's fee. Regulation through litigation may at times overlap with judicial activism.

This is cut off on the northwest side by the Winslade Fault, which heads north east to and . A spur fault heads off east from the Winslade Fault to under the Scrivener Dam. On the northwest and north side of these faults are middle Silurian period rhyodacite volcanic deposits from the Walker Volcanics. The northern side was uplifted compared with the southern side. The name Stromlo is taken from the poems of Ossian.The Free Library: 'Mount Stromlo, ACT, Australia: the origin of the place-name'. The name of the NSW town Temora is also from Ossian's Poems. =Landform= Stoney Creek and its tributaries drain the north side of the mountain, The east side drains into the Molonglo River. The south side supplies Blugar Creek that runs into the Murrumbidgee River. The summit of the mountain where the telescopes are located is elongated in a north-south direction, with a spur running to the southwest where the water treatment plant is situated. Observatory history The first telescope installed at Mount Stromlo was the Oddie telescope which was installed on 8 September 1911. The building housing this telescope was the first construction funded by the Commonwealth Government in Canberra. In January 1913 the first telephone was connected to the Queanbeyan telephone exchange. Mount Stromlo was devastated by the Canberra bushfires of 2003. The fire, fueled by the pine plantation that covered the mountain, destroyed or badly damaged much of the observatory and water treatment plant. Road access is via the Cotter Road on the south side, and Uriarra Road on the east and north. The summit is reached by a road joining Cotter Road just outside . Mountain biking Mount Stromlo is home to one of the finest and most well equipped mountain biking facilities in Australia. Prior to the 2003 bushfires, Mount Stromlo hosted some of the best and oldest mountain bike trails in Australia. In May 2006 extensive remedial work and trail reconstruction was commenced by World Trail in partnership with Canberra Off-Road Cyclists mountain bike club and the ACT Government. Stromlo Forest Park now includes more than of cross country single trail, a Four-Cross course, several observed trials areas and a downhill track. Mount Stromlo hosted the 2009 UCI Mountain Bike & Trials World Championships that attracted more than visitors from up to 40 countries. The event involved more than 750 of the world's top riders who competed in the four mountain bike disciplines of Cross Country, Downhill, Four Cross and Observed Trials. In addition to the mountain biking facilities Mount Stromlo also boasts an event pavilion with office space and change rooms, a kids play area, BBQs, a road cycling criterium circuit, a groomed grass cross country running track and equestrian trails.

Carrier was founded in 1915 as an independent company manufacturing and distributing heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, and has since expanded to include manufacturing commercial refrigeration and foodservice equipment, and fire and security technologies. As of 2020, it was an $18.6 billion company with over 53,000 employees serving customers in 160 countries on six continents. Carrier was acquired by United Technologies in 1979, but it was spun off as an independent company 41 years later in 2020, as was the Otis Elevator Company. History Willis Carrier is credited with inventing modern air conditioning in 1902. In 1915, Carrier and six other engineers pooled $32,600 to form the Carrier Engineering Corporation. They purchased their first factory in 1920, in Newark, New Jersey. The corporation bearing his name marketed its air conditioner to the residential market in the 1950s, which led to formerly sparsely populated areas such as the American Southwest becoming home to sprawling suburbs. In 1955, Carrier merged with Affiliated Gas Equipment, Inc., which owned the Bryant Heater Co., Day & Night Water Heater Co., and Payne Furnace & Supply Co. Carrier Corporation was acquired by United Technologies Corporation (UTC) in July 1979. Prior to the acquisition by UTC, Carrier Corporation was known as the Carrier Air Conditioning Company. International Comfort Products (ICP), headquartered in Lewisburg, Tennessee, was acquired by Carrier in 1999. In the 1990s Carrier stopped using the \\"Day & Night\\" brand (which was the \\"D\\" in the BDP division, or Bryant-Day & Night-Payne) but it was revived in 2006 by ICP. In 2001 Carrier was the \\"world's largest manufacturer of air-conditioning, heating, and refrigerator equipment\\" with a \\"total employment of 42,600\\" and a revenue of $8.9 billion. Carrier announced that it would be closing its DeWitt, New York plant. This led to the layoff of 1000 employees. On March 15, 2004, Carrier acquired the refrigeration subsidiary of Linde. In 2006, Carrier acquired Sensitech, Inc., a provider of logistics and tracking technologies based in Beverly, Massachusetts. A Carrier commercial service van in Montreal, Canada in August 2008 In early 2008, Carrier acquired Environmental Market Solutions, Inc. (EMSI), an environmental and green building consulting company based in the United States. The company has received Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification from the US Green Building Council for its factories in Charlotte, NC, and Huntington, IN (2009), Shanghai, China (2010), and Monterrey, Mexico (2011). In September 2013, Carrier, Otis, and United Technologies Fire and Security were combined into one subsidiary, UTC Building & Industrial Systems. In 2016, Otis was split off, with the remainder becoming UTC Climate, Controls & Security. In January 2016, Carrier announced it would lay off an unspecified number of employees at its research and development division in the town of DeWitt, New York. In February 2016, Carrier announced it would close its Indianapolis factory and move production to Monterrey, Mexico. HVAC Systems and Services North America president Chris Nelson cited \\"ongoing cost and pricing pressures\\" and Carrier's \\"existing infrastructure and a strong supplier base\\" in Mexico, saying that the move would allow the company \\"to operate more cost-effectively.\\" The Carrier spokesperson told the crowd that there would be no immediate impact on jobs, that the move would take place over three years, and no jobs would be affected until mid-2017, with the move to be completed by the end of 2019. Over the November 2016 Thanksgiving holiday weekend, President-Elect Donald Trump tweeted that he was in talks with Carrier Management to keep the factory in Indiana and not move to Mexico. On November 30, 2016, Carrier announced that it had negotiated an agreement with President-elect Trump and Vice President- elect Mike Pence to continue manufacturing gas furnaces in Indianapolis, in addition to retaining engineering and headquarters staff, preserving more than 1,000 jobs in Indianapolis. The agreement included a state incentive package of about $7 million over 10 years. The number of jobs saved was later revised down to 800. In May 2017, as part of their previously announced plan, Carrier told the state of Indiana that it will cut 632 jobs from its Indianapolis factory. Layoffs began at the end of July, 2017 with each worker receiving one week's salary for each year of employment, education and job training, plus 6 months of health insurance as part of the severance package. The New York Times reported on August 10, 2018, that Carrier's Indianapolis furnace plant was plagued by low morale and absenteeism because \\"employees share a looming sense that a factory shutdown is inevitable ‚Äî that Carrier has merely postponed the closing until a more politically opportune moment.\\" On November 26, 2018, United Technologies announced that it would spin off UTC Climate, Controls & Security as an independent company known as Carrier Global Corporation. In March 2020, United Technologies announced that the separation and spin-off of Carrier had been completed. =Syracuse, New York campus= Willis Carrier moved his facilities from New Jersey to Syracuse, New York, in the 1930s. During the late 20th century, when it was acquired by UTC, it was Central New York State's largest manufacturer. Due to increasing labor and union costs in the Central New York area, Carrier has substantially downsized its presence in Syracuse, with manufacturing work being moved to a variety of domestic and international locations. Meanwhile, managerial employees were moved closer to UTC's Connecticut corporate headquarters which represented a challenge to the local economy. Over the course of 2011, the majority of the manufacturing buildings of the Syracuse campus were demolished at a cost of nearly $14 million. Despite the loss of manufacturing jobs, the suburban Syracuse Campus, in DeWitt, New York, remained the primary engineering and design center for Carrier products, with over 1,000 employees and contractors on site. This site also houses the Customer Care Call Center for Carrier branded products. In 1980, Carrier was allowed to name the Carrier Dome, the football and basketball arena at Syracuse University, after Mel Holm, the company's then-CEO chair of the university's Board of Trustees, gave the university $2.75 million toward the facility's construction. Despite being named for an air conditioner manufacturer, the Carrier Dome is not air- conditioned, though it will be after renovations are completed in 2022.

This is chiefly achieved in the overall arrangement of the building masses, reduced to smooth abstract forms, in curved serpentine compositions; through the integration of works of art; and finally through the careful handling of public spaces, at times eccentrically shaped and colourfully treated. The residents are thereby given an impetus to identify with their environment.

In his 11-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career, Leyritz played for the New York Yankees, Anaheim Angels, Texas Rangers, Boston Red Sox, San Diego Padres, and Los Angeles Dodgers. With the Yankees, Leyritz was a member of the and 1999 World Series championships, both over the Atlanta Braves, and gained recognition as one of the best postseason hitters in baseball history during the decade. Early years Leyritz grew up in Anderson Township, Hamilton County, Ohio with his parents, brother, and sister, and attended Turpin High School in Cincinnati, Ohio. He then attended Middle Georgia College, a junior college in Cochran, Georgia, before transferring to the University of Kentucky. At Kentucky, Leyritz played college baseball for the Kentucky Wildcats baseball team. Baseball career After playing the 1985 season for the Kentucky Wildcats, Leyritz went undrafted by Major League Baseball (MLB), but was signed as a free agent by the New York Yankees. Leyritz made his MLB debut for the Yankees on June 8, 1990. His playing days were highlighted by a pair of memorable postseason home runs he hit with the Yankees in 1995 and 1996 in comeback wins. In Game 2 of the 1995 American League Division Series against the Seattle Mariners at Yankee Stadium, in rainy conditions, Leyritz hit a walk- off two-run home run to right-center field in the 15th inning, giving the Yankees a 7‚Äì5 victory and a two-games-to-none lead in the best-of-five series. The home run was surrendered by Mariners pitcher Tim Belcher, who was famously involved in a profanity-laced incident with a cameraman covering him walking through the tunnel to the clubhouse afterwards. The best known of Leyritz's playoff heroics occurred in Game 4 of the 1996 World Series against the Atlanta Braves at Atlanta‚ÄìFulton County Stadium. In the series, the Yankees trailed the Braves two games to one, and in Game 4, the Yankees trailed, 6‚Äì0, after five innings. The Yankees rallied for three runs in the 6th inning, setting the stage for Leyritz in the 8th inning. Facing Atlanta closer Mark Wohlers with one out and two runners on base, Leyritz hit a three-run home run to left field to tie the game and cap the improbable Yankee comeback. \\"In the air to left field... back, at the track, at the wall, we are tied!\\" said announcer Joe Buck on national television. The Yankees eventually won the game, 8‚Äì6, in 10 innings to tie the series. In Game 5, Leyritz caught pitchers Andy Pettitte and John Wetteland for a 1‚Äì0 shutout, and the Yankees clinched their championship with a victory in Game 6. After the 1996 season, the Yankees traded Leyritz to the Anaheim Angels for two players to be named later (PTBNL): minor leaguers Jeremy Blevins and Ryan Kane. On July 29, 1997, the Angels traded Leyritz and a PTBNL (minor leaguer Rob Sasser) to the Texas Rangers for Ken Hill. After the season, the Rangers traded Leyritz to the Boston Red Sox with Damon Buford for Mark Brandenburg, Bill Haselman, and Aaron Sele.https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/07/sports/baseball-leyritz-traded- to-the-red-sox.html Leyritz with the Red Sox in spring training in 1998 On June 20, 1998, the Red Sox traded Leyritz with Ethan Faggett to the San Diego Padres for Carlos Reyes, Mandy Romero and Dar√≠o Veras. Leyritz had a number of unlikely playoff home runs and clutch hits that season. The most dramatic of them came in Game 2 of the National League Division Series against Houston Astros pitcher Billy Wagner. Leyritz hit an opposite-field game-tying home run off the right field foul pole in the top of the 9th inning. However, the Astros won the game in the bottom half of the inning. In Game 3, Leyritz hit the eventual game-winning home run against Randy Johnson in the bottom of the 7th inning that broke a 1‚Äì1 tie. Overall, Leyritz batted .400 with three home runs and five runs batted in in that series. Leyritz's Padres were matched against his former team, the Yankees, in the 1998 World Series. During player introductions in Game 1 at Yankee Stadium, Leyritz received a standing ovation from the fans who remembered his heroics from two years earlier. He went hitless in ten at bats in a four-game Yankees sweep. On July 31, 1999, the Padres traded Leyritz to the Yankees for Geraldo Padua. The Yankees advanced to the 1999 World Series, and in Game 4, in the bottom of the 8th inning, Leyritz hit a solo home run to extend the Yankees' lead to 4‚Äì1 and help them complete a sweep of the Braves to win a championship. NBC commentator Bob Costas remarked incredulously about Leyritz after the home run, \\"You could send this guy to a resort in the spring and summer, as long as he comes back for October.\\" That home run was the last one to be hit in the 1990s. On June 20, 2000, the Yankees traded Leyritz to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Jos√© Vizca√≠no and cash. Although he was traded midway during the 2000 season before the Yankees won their third World Series title in four years, Leyritz was awarded his third World Series ring by the Yankees.http://bid.robertedwardauctions.com/bids/bidplace?itemid=38996 Leyritz served as a pinch-hitter more extensively toward the end of his career. He batted and threw right-handed exclusively in the majors, but was known to switch-hit in the minor leagues. =Idiosyncrasies at the plate= Leyritz was known for using an unusual stance which involved keeping his front leg (left leg) straight and stiff while his back leg (right leg) behind him considerably bent at the knee. He did this while circling his bat around behind his head, waiting for the pitch. After each pitch that Leyritz did not put into play or strike out on, he grabbed the bat by its center and twirled it at his hip like a baton. He has said that former Yankee Mickey Rivers taught him how to twirl the bat at his hip. Leyritz was also Pettitte's personal catcher in 1995‚Äì96 and again in 1999‚Äì2000. =Coaching= In February 2011, Leyritz was hired as a pitching coach for the Newark Bears.Newark Hires Leyritz\\". Associated Press. February 4, 2011. He left the team after one season, wanting to spend more time with his family. On April 14, 2012, it was announced that Leyritz was returning to the Yankees on a personal services contract. Personal life As of March 2015, Leyritz lives in Orange County, California, with his wife Michelle, three sons, and her two daughters. They married in July 2015. He is a member and usher at Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California. =Amphetamine use= On June 8, 2006, while doing an interview on the Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio, Leyritz admitted to using amphetamines while playing when they were not against the rules. The statement came in the wake of an admission by pitcher Jason Grimsley that he used performance- enhancing drugs throughout his career. =Legal trouble= On December 28, 2007, Leyritz was arrested in Broward County, Florida on suspicion of drunk driving and vehicular homicide in which Leyritz's car struck Freida Veitch's car. Veitch, who was returning home from her bartending job, was not wearing a seat belt. She ejected from the car and died at the scene. Leyritz was released on US$11,000 bond and charged with two counts of drunk driving. Police collected two blood samples from Leyritz, the first 2¬Ω hours after the crash and the second about an hour later. The first sample showed a blood- alcohol level of .14, and the second, .13, police said. Florida's legal limit for motorists is .08. Prosecutors say Veitch had a blood-alcohol level of .18. Several days after the accident, it was revealed that Leyritz may face further charges because he had his license suspended in New York prior to the accident. On June 20, 2007, Leyritz was ticketed outside Albany, New York for using a cell phone while driving. On November 23, his license was suspended after he failed to appear in court. The state of Florida is processing the suspension notice from New York and could file additional charges once his Florida license is suspended. According to an official from the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles: \\"The department has the statutory ability to suspend his license based on the fact he had knowledge of a suspension in another state and still came to Florida for a driver's license. It is unlawful.\\" Leyritz's lawyer is quoted as saying that Leyritz's license \\"was not suspended in the state of Florida on the day of the accident, nor is it suspended today.\\" On February 13, 2009, Leyritz was ordered back to jail as his bail was revoked following his apparent consumption of alcoholic beverages in violation with his bail conditions. A judge allowed him to return home on bail on February 23 after agreeing with Leyritz's attorney that his pretrial release conditions were unclear and that Leyritz had misunderstood rather than intentionally violated the terms.Leyritz To Remain Out of Jail While Awaiting Trial SI.com, February 23, 2009 On May 13, 2009, Leyritz was hospitalized in Florida. Reports on ESPN claimed Leyritz had threatened suicide, but Leyritz issued a statement later saying he was not suicidal but stressed out. Leyritz ran into trouble on May 14 when he attempted to start his car but the alcohol monitoring device on the car malfunctioned, leading to a false positive and triggering an automatic urine test for Leyritz. The test showed he had not consumed any alcohol and a judge cleared him. On July 2, 2009, Leyritz was arrested for battery against his former wife,Ex-Yankee Leyritz accused of battery UPI.com, July 2, 2009 (UPI) however the charges were later dropped. In November 2010, Leyritz's trial for the December 2007 DUI crash was held. He was acquitted on the DUI Manslaughter charge by a jury in less than 45 minutes, but was convicted, after 2 days of deliberations, by the jury on a misdemeanor charge of driving under the influence, which carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail. He was subsequently sentenced to one year's probation and a $500 fine. In May 2010, Leyritz's insurance company settled a civil lawsuit for the accident, paying $350,000 to the other driver's family.\\"Jim Leyritz acquitted of DUI manslaughter in Florida\\".

North Jakarta is not self-governed and does not have a city council, hence it is not classified as a proper municipality. It contains the entire coastal area within the Jakarta Special District. In North Jakarta, an area at the estuary of Ciliwung river was the main port for the kingdom of Tarumanegara, which later grew to become Jakarta. Many historic sites and artefacts of Jakarta can be found in North Jakarta. Both ports of Tanjung Priok and historic Sunda Kelapa are located in the city. The city, which had 1,645,312 inhabitants at the 2010 Census, has its administrative centre in Tanjung Priok. North Jakarta contains some of Jakarta's original natural mangrove forests. As the city has developed, some of this mangrove forest was converted into urban areas. However, a reforestation project aimed at planting mangroves within an area of 400 hectares was enacted in 2011 and was scheduled to be finished in 2012. The main goal of the project was to minimize abrasion in the coastal area, especially around the Pantai Indah Kapuk area. North Jakarta is bounded by Java Sea to the north; Bekasi to the east; West Jakarta, Central Jakarta and East Jakarta to the south; and Tangerang to the west. History Laundry workers working at Ciliwung river in Pasar Baru, circa between 1915 and 1925. The present-day city of Jakarta grew from the area which is now North Jakarta. In the 5th century, at the mouth of the Ciliwung-Angke River, the development began with the port city Sundapura (now near Tugu, Jakarta and Bekasi), which was the main port for the Kingdom of Tarumanegara under the leadership of King Mulawarman. During the 16th century, the city, which covered only the area of what is now North Jakarta, was known as Jayakarta. The system of government in Jayakarta has been amended several times, including changes of rulers, and shifting borders of the administrative area. This area consisted of three forms of government: first, the city government which was controlled directly by the Lord of Jayakarta (the area of which is located in what is now the Port of Angke); second, the state government controlled by leaders inferior to the Lord of Jayakarta (the area of which is located in what is now Pasar Ikan and Kota; and third, the worldwide government (the area of which is located in what is now Tanjung Priok. At the beginning of the 17th century, the area was controlled by Chinese and other native people who later had to submit to the Dutch East Indies. In 1854, the Law of Comptabuliteit 1854 divided the Jakarta Bay area into three categories: the Voorsteden (the suburbs), Regentschap Batavia (the Regency of Batavia) and private areas (supervised by the Department of Security - Afdeling I) The government system changed again in 1905. After the formation of Gemeente Batavia, the area around Jakarta Bay was transformed into Batavia District (kewedanan) which includes Penjaringan, Tanjung Priok, Meester Cornelis and Bekasi. Meanwhile, Tanjung Priok came to be under the control of Haven Directie Koninklijke Paketvaart-Maatschappij. When Japan entered into the region, the form of the government changed into Shiku (district level), and so North Jakarta was divided into districts such as Shiku Penjaringan, Shiku Tanjung Priok and Shiku Bekasi. After the formation of the Unitary Republic of Indonesia on August 17, 1945, Jakarta Bay was divided into several administrative regions, namely Kewedanan Penjaringan, Tanjung Priok and Bekasi. These three kawedanan are controlled by the mayorship of Jakarta Raya, which is a part of West Java. In 1957, after the formation of the Kotapraja Jakarta Raya, the area of Jakarta Bay was transformed into the Kotamadya of Jakarta Utara or \\"City of North Jakarta\\".

Based on parallax measurements, it is approximately from the Sun. It is one of the stars that at times lies near the south celestial pole due to precession. Œ¥ Velorum consists of an eclipsing binary, designated Delta Velorum A, and a more distant third companion, Delta Velorum B. Œ¥ Velorum A's two components are themselves designated Aa (officially named Alsephina , the traditional name for the entire system) and Ab.  Nomenclature  Œ¥ Velorum and the False Cross, lying across the Milky Way near the centre of this panorama Œ¥ Velorum (Latinised to Delta Velorum) is the system's Bayer designation. The designations of the two constituents as Delta Velorum A and B, and those of A's components ‚Äì Delta Velorum Aa and Ab ‚Äì derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Delta Velorum bore the traditional name Alsafinah, which stems from the Arabic name al-safƒ´nah meaning \\"the ship\\", referring to the ancient Greek constellation Argo Navis, the ship of the Argonauts. It was first used in a 10th-century Arabic translation of the Almagest, written by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the second century AD. Although the name originally referred to an entire constellation, it was assigned to this particular bright star at least as early as 1660, when it appeared in Andreas Cellarius‚Äôs Harmonia Macrocosmica, a renowned 17th century Dutch magnificently illustrated book about the cosmos. In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. It approved the name Alsephina for the component Œ¥ Velorum Aa on 5 September 2017 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names. The False Cross is an asterism formed of Delta and Kappa Velorum along with Iota Carinae and Epsilon Carinae. It is so called because it is sometimes mistaken for the Southern Cross, causing errors in astronavigation. In Chinese, (), meaning Celestial Earth God's Temple, refers to an asterism consisting of Delta Velorum, Gamma2 Velorum, Kappa Velorum and b Velorum. Consequently, Delta Velorum itself is known as (), \\"the Third Star of Celestial Earth God's Temple\\". In a different Chinese view, this star appears in an asterism with the given name of Koo She (Chinese: ÂºßÁü¢, h√∫ sh«ê, \\"Bow and Arrow\\"), comprising Delta Velorum, Omega Carinae, and stars from Canis Major. Stellar system Delta Velorum is a triple star system. The outer components, Œ¥ Velorum A and B, have a wide orbit with a 143-year period. The primary component A has an apparent magnitude of 2.00, while the secondary B is magnitude 5.54, with a combined magnitude measured at 1.96. As of 2013, the two stars were separated by 0.6\\", but they have an eccentric orbit and their average separation over the whole orbit is nearly 2\\". In 1978 the primary component was reported to be a spectroscopic binary in the Proceedings of the Australian Astronomical Observatory, and this was confirmed by the Hipparcos satellite. Relative positions and separations of components A, B, C, and D of Œ¥ Velorum In 2000 it was announced that the inner components Aa and Ab form an eclipsing binary, having an orbital period of 45.15 days and an eccentricity of 0.230. The semi-major axis as their orbit corresponds to a mean separation of 90.61 AU. Delta Velorum is the brightest known eclipsing binary, although Algol has a deeper minimum and is easier to observe visually. Observations of variability in the Delta Velorum system were made independently by ground- based astronomers and the Galileo spaceprobe at Jupiter. The inner pair were resolved using interferometry in 2007, and then using NACO adaptive optics with the Very Large Telescope. Photometry of the components of Œ¥ Velorum A gives apparent visual magnitudes of 2.33 and 3.44. The precise orbits allow a dynamical parallax of to be derived, representing a distance of 25.1 parsecs. Another binary system is located at an angular separation of 69 arcseconds from Œ¥ Velorum, sometimes referred to as Œ¥ Velorum C and D. The pair is composed of an 11th magnitude star and a 13th magnitude star, which are 6 arcseconds apart. The two stars, with approximate spectral types of G8V and K0V, are expected to be more distant than Œ¥ Velorum and not physically associated. HD 76653 is a probable (96% chance) co-moving companion; the two have an estimated physical separation of with similar proper motions. Both are likely members of the Ursa Major Moving Group.  Physical properties  The brightnesses of the three stars have been measured at visual and infrared wavelengths using adaptive optics. The physical properties implied by their surface brightnesses and colour indices suggests spectral types of A2IV, A4V, and F8V respectively. More precise physical properties for the stars can be calculated using accurate orbital parameters. Both members of the spectroscopic binary Delta Velorum A are slightly evolved stars that are still on the main sequence. Component Aa has 2.5 times the mass of the Sun, 2.6 times the Sun's radius, and is radiating 56 times the luminosity of the Sun at an effective temperature of 9,470. Component Ab is only slightly smaller, with 2.4 times the Sun's mass and radius, with a luminosity of 47 times the Sun and an effective temperature of 9,370 K. Both stars are rotating rapidly and are significantly oblate, with polar radii smaller than their equatorial radii. Gravity darkening results in their effective temperatures at the pole being higher. For component Aa, the polar radius and temperature are and 10,100 K respectively, while the equatorial radius and temperature are and 9,700 K respectively. For component Ab, the corresponding polar values are and 10,120 K, and the equatorial values are and 9,560 K. This results in the star being brighter when seen along their axes of rotation and less bright when observed at their equators. From Earth, the pair is observed nearly equatorially and the absolute visual magnitude is +0.02; from a different direction the absolute magnitude would be ‚àí0.138 or less. Delta Velorum B is a smaller main sequence star, with a mass of about , a temperature of 6,600 K, a radius of , and a bolometric luminosity of . Southern pole star The south celestial pole will pass close to Delta Velorum around 9000 AD because of precession.

The two components are designated Kappa Velorum A and B. From parallax measurements, this system is located at a distance of roughly from the Sun. The apparent visual magnitude is 2.48, making it readily visible to the naked eye in the southern hemisphere. It forms part of an asterism known as the False Cross along with Delta Velorum, Iota Carinae and Epsilon Carinae, so called because it is sometimes mistaken for the Southern Cross, causing errors in astronavigation. Nomenclature Œ∫ Velorum (Latinised to Kappa Velorum) is the system's Bayer designation. The designations of the two components as Kappa Velorum A and B derives from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The system bore has the traditional name Markab, from the Arabic ŸÖÿ±ŸÉÿ®, markab meaning \\"something to ride\\". It was often spelled Markeb to distinguish it from similarly named stars such as Alpha Pegasi. In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name Markeb for Kappa Velorum on 5 September 2017. Markab had previously been approved for Alpha Pegasi on 30 June 2016. Both are now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.

Properties Kappa Velorum is a spectroscopic binary system consisting of a pair of stars that complete an orbit around each other with a period of 116.65 days and an eccentricity of 0.19. Because the individual stars have not been resolved, further details of the orbit have not yet been determined. The combined stellar classification of the pair is B2 IV, which matches the class of a B-type subgiant star that has exhausted the hydrogen at its core and begun to evolve into a giant. It has an estimated size of 6.9 times the Sun's radius. The system is only a couple of degrees from the south celestial pole of Mars, so it could therefore be considered the southern polar star of that planet. Due to precession of the equinoxes, it will be the closest bright star of note to the south celestial pole of Earth in the period surrounding 9000 AD. = Interstellar medium = Analysis of the spectrum of Kappa Velorum shows absorption lines due to the interstellar medium between Earth and the star. Observation of these features over many years has shown that the lines vary in strength, probably caused by a small dense cloud extending 10¬≤‚Äì10¬≥ au moving across the line of sight.

Lansdowne had been the minister for war and for foreign affairs, but this time he came under withering criticism with few supporters. Background In November 1916 Lansdowne circulated a paper to the Cabinet, in which he argued that the war would destroy civilisation and that therefore peace should be negotiated on the basis of the status quo ante bellum.A. J. P. Taylor, English History 1914 - 1945 (Oxford University Press, 1990), p. 65. Lansdowne's proposal received a hostile response from other Unionists in the Cabinet such as Arthur Balfour and Robert Cecil.Taylor, p. 65. Lansdowne invited the editor of The Times, Geoffrey Dawson, to his house and showed him the letter he wanted to publish. Dawson was \\"appalled\\" and decided that publication would not be in the national interest. Lansdowne also showed the text to the Foreign Office who did not veto it. He then offered the letter to The Daily Telegraph, which accepted it. Publication On 29 November 1917 Lansdowne's letter was published in The Daily Telegraph. It again called for a negotiated peace with Germany: > We are not going to lose this war, but its prolongation will spell ruin for > the civilised world, and an infinite addition to the load of human suffering > which already weighs upon it...We do not desire the annihilation of Germany > as a great power ... We do not seek to impose upon her people any form of > government other than that of their own choice... We have no desire to deny > Germany her place among the great commercial communities of the world. The letter also called for a guarantee of the 'freedom of the seas'. Reaction Lansdowne became a pariah and his letter \\"a deed of shame\\". Bonar Law publicly criticised Lansdowne's letter although U.S. President Woodrow Wilson was said to be \\"impressed\\" by the letter's arguments. H. G. Wells said Lansdowne's letter \\"was the letter of a Peer who fears revolution more than national dishonour\\". Military leaders dismissed Lansdowne's proposals. Douglas Haig said that the prospects for 1918 were \\"excellent\\". Sir William Robertson, when asked whether the war could be won, replied: > Quite frankly, and at the same time quite respectfully, I can only say I am > surprised that the question should be asked. The idea had not before entered > my head that any member of His Majesty's Government had a doubt on the > matter.Taylor, p. 66. Most of the British press were critical of Lansdowne's proposals. The Times attacked it as did The Morning Post and The Daily Mail. The Manchester Guardian and the Daily News welcomed the letter, as did the German press. In the United States, Theodore Roosevelt, the former American president and vocal proponent of the war effort, denounced the letter: \\"Such a peace would leave the liberty loving nations of mankind at the ultimate mercy of the triumphant militarism and capitalism of the German autocracy.\\" The historian A.J.P. Taylor asserted that Fritz Fischer's work on German war aims revealed that the German government's minimum peace terms were incompatible with Lansdowne's proposals and that the Germans would have \\"rudely rejected\\" them.Taylor, p. 65 and note. In February 1918 Lansdowne attempted to further advance bringing the war to a non-military conclusion by founding the Lansdowne Committee, and advocated them on the floor of the House of Lords.

Their mission statement is \\"to research, collect, preserve, and interpret for public enrichment the history, art and culture of African Americans with an emphasis on California and the western United States.\\" CAAM hosts independent and collaborative educational programs both on and off site of lectures, workshops, innovative programs, and hands-on activities that serve public and private school students, museum patrons and community visitors. History CAAM was chartered by the State of California in 1977 and first opened in 1981, in temporary quarters at the California Museum of Science and Industry (now the nearby California Science Center). The museum's first director was arts advocate Aurelia Brooks, while the first object acquired for CAAM‚Äôs permanent collection was a magnificent bronze bust of civil rights activist Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune, created by Richmond Barth√©. In 1984, CAAM moved to its permanent home in Exposition Park, just south of Downtown Los Angeles. The inaugural exhibition The Black Olympians 1904-1984 was curated by CAAM's History Curator Lonnie Bunch, now Founding Director of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. Building The current CAAM facility was built with state and private funds of around $5 million. African‚ÄìAmerican architects Jack Haywood and Vince Proby led the design for the museum. The museum building opened to the public during the Los Angeles Olympic Games in July 1984. A major renovation occurred between 2001 and 2003. The museum occupies a building. It includes three exhibition galleries, a theater gallery, a sculpture court, a conference center special events room, an archive and research library. Behind the scenes there are administration offices, exhibit design and artifact storage areas. A 2011 preliminary planning by design firm Huff and Gooden Architects pegged the cost at $67.3 million for a major expansion and renovation that would nearly triple the size of the museum.Mike Boehm (July 18, 2014), African American Museum director Charmaine Jefferson steps down Los Angeles Times. Collection CAAM exists to research, collect, preserve and interpret for public enrichment, the history, art and culture of African Americans. The museum conserves more than 6,300 objects of art, historical artifacts and memorabilia, and maintains a research library with more than 20,000 books and other reference materials available for limited public use. The permanent collection includes paintings, photographs, sculpture and artifacts representing the diverse contributions of African Americans. The collection ranges from African art to 19th-century landscape. Along with its permanent collection, CAAM hosts specially mounted exhibitions curated out of its own collection, as well as traveling exhibitions from other museums. Programs The Museum's Education Department offers a broad range of programming and events designed to serve the needs of the greater Los Angeles community. Their focus is to provide a variety of enriching, entertaining and enlightening learning experiences, to serve as a resource for diverse communities and to broaden public awareness of the artistic, historical and cultural contributions of African Americans and how other cultures intersect with African American history, art and culture. More than 80 programs are offered annually. Management The California African American Museum has a budget of about $3.5 million a year. Admission is free. The state provides $2.5 million, augmented by funds from a private nonprofit museum foundation that in recent years has generated annual contributions and other revenues of $650,000 to $1.4 million.Mike Boehm (July 18, 2014), African American Museum director Charmaine Jefferson steps down Los Angeles Times.

It is part of the Northern Beaches region. It and Bilgola Plateau were gazetted as suburbs in 2012 dividing the previous suburb of Bilgola. Location Bilgola Beach is located on the Tasman Sea side of the Barrenjoey Peninsula between Avalon to the north and Newport to the south. The land rises steeply behind Bilgola Beach to Bilgola Plateau and then descends to Clareville on the western side of the peninsula. History The name \\"Bilgola\\" is derived from an Aboriginal term Belgoula meaning \\"swirling waters\\", or perhaps \\"a pretty beach with steep slopes, studded with cabbage palms\\". The word Belgoula was noted in Surveyor James Meehan's records of 1814. Robert Henderson received a grant of in 1822 which he named \\"Belgoola\\". The district eventually adopted the simplified name \\"Bilgola\\".The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 29 The area was owned by the McLurcan family from the start of the early 1900s. Mrs McLurcan was famous for her cookery book, 'Mrs McLurcan's Cookery Book'. The large family home was surrounded by cabbage tree palms, for which the area is noted. There were plans during the 1960s to build a bridge bypass of the twisting road ('Bilgola Bends') between the north and south headlands of Bilgola. The bridge was not built but a small amount of landfill was added to remove a sharp bend in the southern end of the road in preparation for construction. The bend still remains, with the landfill now providing a small grassy area, with an excellent view of Newport Beach. Demographics According to the 2011 census of Population, there were 3,863 residents in Bilgola (now the suburbs of Bilgola Beach and Bilgola Plateau). 71.7% of people were born in Australia. The most common other countries of birth were England 9.4%, New Zealand 1.7%, United States of America 1.4%, South Africa 1.0% and Germany 1.0%. 89.7% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included German 1.5%, Italian 0.6%, French 0.6%, Swedish 0.4% and Dutch 0.4%. The most common responses for religion in Bilgola were No Religion 27.8%, Anglican 24.9%, Catholic 21.2%, Uniting Church 4.1% and Presbyterian and Reformed 3.6%. Transport The main road connecting the northern part of the Barrenjoey Peninsula to the rest of Sydney, Barrenjoey Road, runs through Hewitt Park along the cliff line between Bilgola headland and Bilgola South headland. The road separates Bilgola Plateau from Bilgola Beach.  Sport and recreation  Bilgola Surf Life Saving Club is located at Bilgola Beach. It was formed in the summer of 1949 with construction of the club house beginning in 1950.

In 1998, the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer space telescope detected a strong flare that released an X-ray emission nearly equal to the output of the entire star. The quiescent X-ray luminosity of Mu Velorum A is about . The fainter companion, Mu Velorum B, is a main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 6.4 and an assigned stellar classification of G2V. However, this classification is suspect. Closer examination of the spectrum suggests the star may actually have a classification of F4V or F5V, which suggests a mass of about 1.5 times the mass of the Sun. Such stars typically do not show a marked level of magnetic activity.

Birchgrove is located five kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the Inner West Council. Birchgrove is located on the north-west slope of the Balmain peninsula, overlooking Sydney Harbour, and includes Yurulbin and Ballast Points. Balmain is the only adjacent suburb. The long waterfront provides views of the Parramatta River with Cockatoo Island dominating the foreground. It is one of the wealthier suburbs of Sydney thanks to its harbour frontages. History Birchgrove was named after Birchgrove House, built by Lieutenant John Birch, paymaster of the 73rd regiment, around 1812.NSW Geographical Names Register Extract He added 'grove' to his surname when naming the house because of the large number of orange trees growing on the original site. The house was constructed of stone believed to have been quarried on site. In March 1814, the estate was purchased by merchant trader Roland Warpole Loane. By 1818, Loane had returned to land holdings in Tasmania and the estate was leased for many years. Loane unsuccessfully attempted to sub-divide the lot into four parcels in 1833. In 1838, the estate was purchased along with land in the Balmain estate by Captain John McLean. Financial difficulties forced McLean to mortgage the estate and additional land, but the Supreme Court finally foreclosed on loans in April 1844. In 1850, the estate was briefly owned by Henry Watson Parker, who would later become the third premier of New South Wales. Later the same year, the estate was purchased by Didier Numa Joubert. Jourbert leased the property to William Salmon Deliotte until 1856. upright Between 1856 and 1860, Joubert instructed William Brownrigg to survey the first subdivision of ten lots. Streets were named after the Joubert family. Birchgrove House was sold to Jacob Levi Montefiore during the subdivision. Sale of the allotments fell well short of expectations with three lots remaining unsold by 1866. By December 1862, Joubert was forced to surrender his remaining interest to the Bank of New South Wales. From the 1860s, a number of waterfront businesses appeared in the area including coopers, boat builders and the Morrison & Sinclair shipyard. By 1878, due to market pressure from prices in nearby Balmain estate, 82 lots of the original subdivision remained unsold. Additional land was carved from the Birchgrove House when it was sold to John Lowry Adams in 1878. A syndicate of businessmen purchased the remaining lots of the estate and commissioned architect Ferdinand Reuss to draw up a new plan for subdivision. This second subdivision was much more successful with all lots sold within several years. The local heritage item is Clifton Villa, a three-storey sandstone house in the Gothic style. The house was built in the late 1860s and is surrounded by a covered verandah. In the mid-1870s a ballroom was added. The house's interior features a marble fireplace and cedar woodwork, while the exterior includes a caretaker's cottage that was originally a carriage house. Clifton Villa is now listed on the Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/37 In 1900 Adams subdivided the Birchgrove House grounds into 12 lots. In 1911 Mary Scot further subdivided Birchgrove House into 5 lots. The house was eventually demolished in 1967 to make way for units. The suburb was the location of the Balmain Colliery, Australia's deepest coal mine. In August 2010, apartments in Louisa Road were engulfed by fire. No residents were hurt, but the cause of the fire was considered suspicious. =Former tram line to Birchgrove= Tram services branched off from the main line on Darling Street, Balmain, turning left into Rowntree Street, left into Cameron Street and right into Grove Street, before terminating at Wharf Road in Birchgrove. A Transit Systems bus service now follows the former tram route.Gregory's Street Directory, 1955, Map 26, 26A, 1, and 13 =Railway electricity tunnel= Birchgrove was the southern portal of the first tunnel under Sydney Harbour. The tunnel was dug by the New South Wales Government Railways from Greenwich to provide a reliable way to get electricity from the Pyrmont Power Station to the tram network on the north shore. Cables had previously been laid on the floor of the harbour, but damaged by ships dragging their anchors. The tunnel was commenced in 1913 and excavated by hand, completed in 1924. Part of the tunnel is through the silt at the bottom of the river, so required constant pumping until it was allowed to flood in 1930 and abandoned from 1969. The tunnel was excavated almost entirely from the northern side, as the residents on Long Nose Point at Balmain (now Birchgrove) successfully objected to the noise of the compressor powering pneumatic drills. The tunnel passes between the floor of the harbour and the Balmain coal mine further below the harbour. The tunnel is excavated entirely through Hawkesbury sandstone which lies below the silt and sediment which form the floor of the harbour. At its lowest point, it is below sea level. The tunnel is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register.  Heritage listings  Birchgrove has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 144 Louisa Road: Raywell * 25 Wharf Road: Wyoming * Sydney Harbour railway electricity tunnel Landmarks thumb * Ballast Point Park is a 2.6 hectare former industrial site located at the tip of the Balmain Peninsula now redeveloped as a public open space. * Yurulbin Park is a former shipbuilding site located at the end of Yurulbin Point (Long Nose Point) which has been transformed into an award-winning public space. * Pubs ‚Äì Birchgrove and Balmain are home to many famous drinking establishments, including the Sir William Wallace Hotel, named after the Scottish hero who was the subject of the film Braveheart. Transport Birchgrove ferry wharf provides access to the Cockatoo Island ferry services which run services between Circular Quay and Cockatoo Island. Transit Systems operates a service from Birchgrove Park to the Art Gallery of New South Wales via the Queen Victoria Building (QVB). During peak hours and in the evening, this service terminates at QVB. Recreation Birchgrove is home to the Balmain Sailing Club, which hosts the annual Balmain Regatta, claimed to be the oldest regatta in Australia, run for the first time in 1849.Balmain Regatta PopulationDemographics= thumb Houses overlooking Snails Bay, Birchgrove (Wharf Road) In the 2016 census of Population and Housing, there were 3,303 people in Birchgrove.

Simply by replacing the original PSKCore file (it is suggested that you rename the original rather than deleting it) with the new version, the PSK31 software supports PSK63 instead of PSK31. This technique has been used during early experiments with the PSK63 mode, but it is not likely to continue to be very widely used now that software that supports PSK63 directly has become widely available.

His reputation rests largely on his authorship of the early chess book Essai sur le jeu des echecs published 1737 in France (English translation: The Noble Game Of Chess 1745). This book brought the Middle Eastern concept of the endgame to the attention of Europe and helped revive European interest in the study of the endgame. Stamma died in London c. 1755, with two sons surviving him.  Strong player  Stamma was a regular at Slaughter's Coffee House in St Martin's Lane (London), a center of 18th century English chess, and was considered one of England's strongest players. He was defeated quite handily by Philidor in a famous match in 1747, which marked the beginning of Philidor's rise to fame. Apart from the higher skills of Philidor, Ludwig Bledow and Otto von Oppen have suggested that his defeat could be attributed to the fact that Stamma, in Ottoman Syria, was used to playing with the Arabic rules and only after his arrival to Europe got acquainted with the Western rules. Bledow and Oppen also commented that the match was poorly documented, being mentioned only by Philidor's biographers who frequently contradicted each other. L. Bledow, O. von Oppen, Stamma's hundert Endspiele, Berlin 1856  Other legacy  Stamma's book introduced algebraic chess notation in an almost fully developed form before the now obsolete descriptive chess notation evolved. Philidor's writings had more influence after his victory over Stamma, and the descriptive system based on Philidor's approach was dominant for a long time. The main difference between Stamma's system and the modern system is that Stamma used p for pawn moves and the original file of the piece (a through h) instead of the initial letter of the piece. His name is attached to the Stamma Gambit in the King's Gambit (1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.h4), and Stamma's mate, a rather rare checkmate.

Among the wax replicas on display include those of A-List stars, classic entertainers, and legendary singers (such as Elvis Presley). Overview The museum, brainchild of entrepreneur Spoony Singh, opened on February 25, 1965, and claims in promotional literature to be the only wax museum dedicated solely to celebrities. It is the longest-running wax museum in the United States. When Singh opened the Hollywood Wax Museum, the line to get in was 1/2 mile long. The former sawmill operator from Canada built the Museum's fame by befriending celebrities, gossip columnists, members of the foreign press association and fans. After Singh's retirement, his sons and grandson have continued to own, operate and further the Hollywood Wax Museum's legacy. In June 2012, the family was recognized as Heroes of Hollywood by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce Community Foundation for their staunch and generous support of the Hollywood community. In popular culture The Hollywood Wax Museum has appeared in the following movies and TV shows: The Mechanic (1972), Wes Craven's Cursed (2005), and America's Next Top Model (2007). The Hollywood Wax Museum is also featured on the video game, Midnight Club: Los Angeles. Mr. Singh himself appeared on the popular quiz show What's My Line? on the night of November 7, 1965. This also marked the last show featuring long-time panelist Dorothy Kilagallen. Location The Hollywood Wax Museum building once housed the most exclusive hangout in Los Angeles: The Embassy Club. It is on Hollywood Blvd, near Highland Ave. Sets and Exhibitions Wax figures and sets featuring replicas of celebrities continue to change regularly. There is also a Chamber of Horrors, featuring classic and current movie monsters. Other Locations The group opened Hollywood Wax Museum Branson in Branson, Missouri in 1996, which was completely renovated in 2009 and was recognized with the 2011 Branson Beautification Award for improving an important stretch of the Highway 76 strip. The next Hollywood Wax Museum was opened in Gatlinburg, Tennessee in 2007 and closed in 2010 to make way for the larger Hollywood Wax Museum Pigeon Forge attraction in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee that opened in May 2012. The fourth location opened in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina in 2014 at Broadway at the Beach.

Mizar is the second star from the end of the Big Dipper's handle, and Alcor its fainter companion. The traditional name Mizar derives from the Arabic ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ¶ÿ≤ÿ± mi ºzar meaning 'apron; wrapper, covering, cover'. Alcor was originally Arabic ÿ≥Ÿáÿß‚Äé SuhƒÅ/SohƒÅ, meaning either the ‚Äòforgotten‚Äô or ‚Äòneglected‚Äô one; notable as a faintly perceptible companion of Mizar. Mizar, also designated Zeta Ursae Majoris (Œ∂ Ursae Majoris, abbreviated Zeta UMa, Œ∂ UMa), is itself a quadruple system and Alcor, also designated 80 Ursae Majoris (80 UMa), is a binary, the pair together forming a sextuple system. The whole system lies about 83 light-years away from the Sun, as measured by the Hipparcos astrometry satellite. Stellar system With normal eyesight Alcor appears at about 12 minutes of arc from Mizar. Alcor is of magnitude 3.99 and spectral class A5V. It has a faint red dwarf companion separated by 1 second of arc. Mizar and Alcor's proper motions show they move together, along with most of the other stars of the Big Dipper except Alpha Ursae Majoris and Eta Ursae Majoris, as members of the Ursa Major Moving Group, a mostly dispersed group of stars sharing a common birth. However, it has yet to be demonstrated conclusively that they are gravitationally bound. Gaia parallax measurements indicate that the Alcor binary and Mizar quadruple are somewhat closer together than previously thought: . The uncertainty is due to our uncertainty about the exact distances from us. If they are exactly the same distance from us then the distance between them is only . Between Mizar and Alcor, the 8th-magnitude star Sidus Ludoviciana is a distant background object. Other names Mizar is known as Vashistha, one of the Saptarishi, and Alcor as Arundhati, wife of Vashistha, in traditional Indian astronomy. As a married couple, they are considered to symbolize marriage and in some Hindu communities to this day priests conducting a wedding ceremony allude to or point out the asterism as a symbol of the closeness marriage brings to a couple. Al-Sahja was the rhythmical form of the usual Suha. It appears as ', 'the Faint One', in an interesting list of Arabic star names, published in Popular Astronomy, January 1895, by Professor Robert H. West, of the Syrian Protestant College at Beirut. Although the statement has been made that Alcor was not known to the ancient Greeks, there is an old story that it was the Lost Pleiad Electra, which had wandered here from her companions and became Alopex, the Fox. A Latin title was Eques Stellula, the Little Starry Horseman; Eques, the Cavalier, is from the 17th- century German astronomer Bayer. Mizar and Alcor together are sometimes called the \\"Horse and Rider\\" (and popularly, in England, Jack on the Middle Horse), with Mizar being the horse. The Persian astronomer Al Biruni (973‚Äì1048 A.D.) mentioned its importance in the family life of the Arabs on the 18th day of the Syrian month Adar, the March equinox; and a modern story of that same people makes it the infant of the walidan (mother?) among the three Banat (the Mourners: Alioth, Mizar, and Alkaid).In 50,000 years The Big Dipper will face the other way. Chinese Taoism personifies Œ∂ Ursae Majoris as the Lu star.

Arabic literature says that only those with the sharpest eyesight can see the companion of Mizar. The 14thcentury Arabian lexicographer Firuzabadi called it \\"Our Riddle\\", while the 13thcentury Persian astronomical writer Zakariya al-Qazwini said that \\"people tested their eyesight by this star.\\" Humboldt wrote of it as being seen with difficulty, and Arago similarly alluded to it. Astronomer Sir Patrick Moore suggested that this in fact refers to another star that lies visually between Mizar and Alcor. This star is occasionally known as \\"Ludwig's Star\\", it was observed on 2 December 1722 by the German astronomer Johann Georg Liebknecht (23 April 1679 ‚Äì 17 September 1749) and named in honour of his patron the Landgrave Ludwig of Hessen-Darmstadt. Liebknecht thought it was a planet, but it had already been observed in exactly the same position by Benedetto Castelli (1577‚Äì1643) approximately a century earlier in 1616, which indicated it was a background star. > The Arabs in the desert regarded it as a test of penetrating vision; and > they were accustomed to oppose \\"Sohail\\" to \\"Soha\\" (Canopus to Alcor) as > occupying respectively the highest and lowest posts in the celestial > hierarchy. So that Vidit Alcor, at non lunam plenam (Latin for \\"he saw > Alcor, but not the full moon\\"), came to be a proverbial description of one > keenly alive to trifles, but dull of apprehension for broad facts. :‚Äî Agnes > M, Clerke, The Herschels and Modern Astronomy (1901) In Japanese mythology, Alcor is known as the lifespan star or \\"jumy≈çboshi\\" (ÂØøÂëΩÊòü) as it was believed that one who could not see this star would pass away by year's end. The Japanese manga Fist of the North Star uses this legend as a model for its death-omen star (Ê≠ªÂÖÜÊòü), in which it was said that people who saw the star would die later in the year. 6-star systemThe discovery= Benedetto Castelli, one of the Galileo's colleagues in the 17th century, observed Mizar through a telescope and realized that it was a binary system: Mizar A and Mizar B. Then, throughout the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, with the help of spectroscopy, scientists showed that Mizar A and B were both binary systems. In 1908, the Alcor-Mizar system was the first 5-star system ever discovered. In 2009, Eric Mamajek and his colleagues from the University of Rochester, while searching for exoplanets, discovered that Alcor was also a binary system, making the Alcor and Mizar a 6-star system. The same conclusion was independently found by Ben Oppenheimer from the American Natural History Museum. =Characteristics=ReferencesExternal links * Mizar and Alcor articles at Jim Kaler's Stars website * Category:Big Dipper Category:Stars with proper names Category:Ursa Major (constellation) Category:Binary stars ","title":"Mizar and Alcor"},{"id":"2728886","text":"Robert J. \\"Bob\\" Hodge (born 1955) is an American distance runner who came third in the 1979 Boston Marathon with a time of 2:12:30.List of Boston marathon winners 1979 He has also won the Mount Washington Road Race (1976‚Äì1980, 1985 and 1987),Mount Washington Road Race.

British settlers began moving into the area in the early 19th century, establishing farms and orchards on the fertile soil. In 1928, a Frank Young brought the property which was now known as Blairmount and turned it into a horse stud specialising in Clydesdale horses. The suburb began to be redeveloped into housing in the 1980s and a school was opened in 1983. Demographics According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 482 residents in Blairmount. In Blairmount, 62.8% of people were born in Australia. The most common other countries of birth were England 3.7%, Samoa 2.7%, New Zealand 2.5%, Fiji 2.3% and Lebanon 2.3%. 64.5% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Samoan 5.0%, Arabic 4.4%, Hindi 2.9%, Spanish 2.3% and Italian 1.7%. The most common responses for religion in Blairmount were Catholic 39.5%, Anglican 16.0%, No Religion 6.9%, Islam 5.6% and Presbyterian and Reformed 3.7%.

It is named for the Italian chemist Pietro Biginelli.Kappe, C. Oliver (2005) \\"The Biginelli Reaction\\", in: J. Zhu and H. Bienaym√© (eds.): Multicomponent Reactions, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, . The Biginelli Reaction This reaction was developed by Pietro Biginelli in 1891. The reaction can be catalyzed by Br√∏nsted acids and/or by Lewis acids such as copper(II) trifluoroacetate hydrate and boron trifluoride. Several solid-phase protocols utilizing different linker combinations have been published. Dihydropyrimidinones, the products of the Biginelli reaction, are widely used in the pharmaceutical industry as calcium channel blockers, antihypertensive agents, and alpha-1-a-antagonists. More recently products of the Biginelli reaction have been investigated as potential selective Adenosine A2b receptor antagonists. Including highly selective tricyclic compounds. Reaction mechanism The reaction mechanism of the Biginelli reaction is a series of bimolecular reactions leading to the desired dihydropyrimidinone. According to a mechanism proposed by Sweet in 1973 the aldol condensation of ethylacetoacetate 1 and the aryl aldehyde is the rate-limiting step leading to the carbenium ion 2. The nucleophilic addition of urea gives the intermediate 4, which quickly dehydrates to give the desired product 5. The mechanism of the Biginelli reaction This mechanism is superseded by one by Kappe in 1997: center This scheme begins with rate determining nucleophilic addition by the urea to the aldehyde. The ensuing condensation step is catalyzed by the addition of acid, resulting in the imine nitrogen. The Œ≤-ketoester then adds to the imine bond and consequently the ring is closed by the nucleophilic attack by the amine onto the carbonyl group. This final step ensues a second condensation and results in the Biginelli compound. Advances in Biginelli reaction In 1987, Atwal et al. reported a modification to the Biginelli reaction that consistently generated higher yields. Atul Kumar has reported first enzymatic synthesis for Biginelli reaction via yeast catalysed protocol in high yields. The reaction has also been reported via green methodologies.

In geometry, Napoleon's theorem states that if equilateral triangles are constructed on the sides of any triangle, either all outward or all inward, the lines connecting the centres of those equilateral triangles themselves form an equilateral triangle. The triangle thus formed is called the inner or outer Napoleon triangle. The difference in the area of these two triangles equals the area of the original triangle. The theorem is often attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte (1769‚Äì1821). Some have suggested that it may date back to W. Rutherford's 1825 question published in The Ladies' Diary, four years after the French emperor's death, but the result is covered in three questions set in an examination for a Gold Medal at the University of Dublin in October, 1820, whereas Napoleon died the following May. Proofs In the figure above, ABC is the original triangle. AZB, BXC, and CYA are equilateral triangles constructed on its sides' exteriors, and points L, M, and N are the centroids of those triangles. The theorem for outer triangles states that triangle LMN (green) is equilateral. A quick way to see that the triangle LMN is equilateral is to observe that MN becomes CZ under a clockwise rotation of 30¬∞ around A and a homothety of ratio with the same center, and that LN also becomes CZ after a counterclockwise rotation of 30¬∞ around B and a homothety of ratio with the same center. The respective spiral similarities are A(,-30¬∞) and B(,30¬∞). That implies MN = LN and the angle between them must be 60¬∞.For a visual demonstration see Napoleon's Theorem via Two Rotations at Cut-the-Knot. There are in fact many proofs of the theorem's statement, including a synthetic (coordinate-free) one,Coxeter, H.S.M., and Greitzer, Samuel L. 1967. Geometry Revisited, pages 60-63. a trigonometric one, a symmetry-based approach, and proofs using complex numbers. Background Extract from the 1826 Ladies' Diary giving geometric and analytic proofs The theorem has frequently been attributed to Napoleon, but several papers have been written concerning this issue which cast doubt upon this assertion (see ). The following entry appeared on page 47 in the Ladies' Diary of 1825 (so in late 1824, a year or so after the compilation of Dublin examination papers). This is an early appearance of Napoleon's theorem in print, and Napoleon's name is not mentioned. :VII. Quest.(1439); by Mr. W. Rutherford, Woodburn. ::\\"Describe equilateral triangles (the vertices being either all outward or all inward) upon the three sides of any triangle ABC: then the lines which join the centres of gravity of those three equilateral triangles will constitute an equilateral triangle. Required a demonstration.\\" Since William Rutherford was a very capable mathematician, his motive for requesting a proof of a theorem that he could certainly have proved himself is unknown. Maybe he posed the question as a challenge to his peers, or perhaps he hoped that the responses would yield a more elegant solution. However, it is clear from reading successive issues of the Ladies Diary in the 1820s, that the Editor aimed to include a varied set of questions each year, with some suited for the exercise of beginners. Plainly there is no reference to Napoleon in either the question or the published responses, which appeared a year later in 1826, though the Editor evidently omitted some submissions. Also, Rutherford himself does not appear amongst the named solvers after the printed solutions, although from the tally a few pages earlier it is evident that he did send in a solution, as did several of his pupils and associates at Woodburn School, including the first of the published solutions. Indeed, the Woodburn Problem Solving Group, as it might be known today, was sufficiently well known by then to be written up in A Historical, Geographical, and Descriptive View of the County of Northumberland ... (2nd ed. Vo. II, pp. 123‚Äì124). It had been thought that the first known reference to this result as Napoleon's theorem appears in Faifofer's 17th Edition of Elementi di Geometria published in 1911,, but the historical record cites various editions in different years. This reference is from although Faifofer does actually mention Napoleon in somewhat earlier editions. But this is moot because we find Napoleon mentioned by name in this context in an encyclopaedia by 1867. What is of greater historical interest as regards Faifofer is the problem he had been using in earlier editions: a classic problem on circumscribing the greatest equilateral triangle about a given triangle that Thomas Moss had posed in the Ladies Diary in 1754, in the solution to which by William Bevil the following year we might easily recognize the germ of Napoleon's Theorem - the two results then run together, back and forth for at least the next hundred years in the problem pages of the popular almanacs: when Honsberger proposed in Mathematical Gems in 1973 what he thought was a novelty of his own, he was actually recapitulating part of this vast, if informal, literature. It might be as well to recall that a popular variant of the Pythagorean proposition, where squares are placed on the edges of triangles, was to place equilateral triangles on the edges of triangles: could you do with equilateral triangles what you could do with squares - for example, in the case of right triangles, dissect the one on the hypotenuse into those on the legs? Just as authors returned repeatedly to consider other properties of Euclid's Windmill or Bride's Chair, so the equivalent figure with equilateral triangles replacing squares invited - and received - attention. Perhaps the most majestic effort in this regard is William Mason's Prize Question in the Lady's and Gentleman's Diary for 1864, the solutions and commentary for which the following year run to some fifteen pages. By then, this particular venerable venue - starting in 1704 for the Ladies' Diary and in 1741 for the Gentleman's Diary - was on its last legs, but problems of this sort continued in the Educational Times right into the early 1900s. =Dublin Problems, October, 1820= In the Geometry paper, set on the second morning of the papers for candidates for the Gold Medal in the General Examination of the University of Dublin in October 1820, the following three problems appear. :Question 10. Three equilateral triangles are thus constructed on the sides of a given triangle, A, B, D, the lines joining their centres, C, C', C\\" form an equilateral triangle. [The accompanying diagram shows the equilateral triangles placed outwardly.] :Question 11. If the three equilateral triangles are constructed as in the last figure, the lines joining their centres will also form an equilateral triangle. [The accompanying diagram shows the equilateral triangles places inwardly.] :Question 12. To investigate the relation between the area of the given triangle and the areas of these two equilateral triangles. These problems are recorded in * Dublin problems: a collection of questions proposed to the candidates for the gold medal at the general examinations, from 1816 to 1822 inclusive. Which is succeeded by an account of the fellowship examination, in 1823 (G. and W. B. Whittaker, London, 1823)http://solo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?vid=OXVU1&docId;=oxfaleph014134656 http://dbooks.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/books/PDFs/590315941.pdf [22.8MB] Question 1249 in the Gentleman's Diary; or Mathematical Repository for 1829 (so appearing in late 1828) takes up the theme, with solutions appearing in the issue for the following year. One of the solvers, T. S. Davies then generalized the result in Question 1265 that year, presenting his own solution the following year, drawing on a paper he had already contributed to the Philosophical Magazine in 1826. There are no cross-references in this material to that described above. However, there are several items of cognate interest in the problem pages of the popular almanacs both going back to at least the mid-1750s (Moss) and continuing on to the mid-1860s (Mason), as alluded to above. As it happens, Napoleon's name is mentioned in connection with this result in no less a work of reference than Chambers's Encyclopedia as early as 1867 (Vol. IX, towards the close of the entry on triangles). : Another remarkable property of triangles, known as Napoleon's problem is as follows: if on any triangle three equilateral triangles are described, and the centres of gravity of these three be joined, the triangle thus formed is equilateral, and has its centre of gravity coincident with that of the original triangle. But then the result had appeared, with proof, in a textbook by at least 1834 (James Thomson's Euclid, pp. 255‚Äì256 The First Six and the Eleventh and Twelfth Books of Euclid's Elements; with Notes and Illustrations, and an Appendix in Five Books (Adam and Charles B;ack, Edinburgh; Longman, Rees & co, London; John Cumming, Dublin; Simms & McIntyre, Belfast; James Brash & Co, Glasgow, 1834) https://books.google.com/books?id=dQBfAAAAcAAJ). In an endnote (p. 372), Thomason adds : This curious proposition I have not met with, except in the Dublin Problems, published in 1823, where it is inserted without demonstration. In the second edition (1837), Thomson extended the endnote by providing proof from a former student in Belfast: : The following is an outline of a very easy and neat proof it by Mr. Adam D. Glasgow of Belfast, a former student of mine of great taste and talent for mathematical pursuits: Thus, Thomson does not appear aware of the appearance of the problem in the Ladies' Diary for 1825 or the Gentleman's Diary for 1829 (just as J. S. Mackay was to remain unaware of the latter appearance, with its citation of Dublin Problems, while noting the former; readers of the American Mathematical Monthly have a pointer to Question 1249 in the Gentleman's Diary from R. C. Archibald in the issue for January 1920, p. 41, fn. 7, although the first published solution in the Ladies Diary for 1826 shows that even Archibald was not omniscient in matters of priority). Common center The centers of both the inner and outer Napoleon triangles coincide with the centroid of the original triangle. This coincidence was noted in Chambers's Encyclopaedia in 1867, as quoted above. The entry there is unsigned. P. G. Tait, then Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh, is listed amongst the contributors, but J. U. Hillhouse, Mathematical Tutor also at the University of Edinburgh, appears amongst other literary gentlemen connected for longer or shorter times with the regular staff of the Encyclopaedia. However, in Section 189(e) of An Elementary Treatise on Quaternions,Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1867, pp. 133--135 also in 1867, Tait treats the problem (in effect, echoing Davies' remarks in the Gentleman's Diary in 1831 with regard to Question 1265, but now in the setting of quaternions): : If perpendiculars be erected outwards at the middle points of the sides of a triangle, each being proportional to the corresponding side, the mean point of their extremities coincides with that of the original triangle. Find the ratio of each perpendicular to half the corresponding side of the old triangle that the new triangle may be equilateral. Tait concludes that the mean points of equilateral triangles erected outwardly on the sides of any triangle form an equilateral triangle. The discussion is retained in subsequent editions in 1873 and 1890, as well as in his further Introduction to Quaternions Macmillan, London, 1873, pp. 42--43 jointly with Philip Kelland in 1873.

Bondi Beach is a neighbouring suburb and beach on the east side of Bondi. Bondi Junction is a neighbouring suburb and commercial centre to the west of Bondi. Tamarama, Bronte and Waverley are situated on the south side of Bondi. History Bondi is said to be a corruption of an Aboriginal word boondi meaning water breaking over rocks.Book of Sydney Suburbs, Frances Pollon (Angus and Robertson) 1990, p.33 It has been spelt a number of different ways over time, e.g. Boondi, Bundi, Bundye. The current spelling was accepted in 1827.

In the 1880s, Malcolm Campbell built Scarba, a two-storey, Italianate house in Wellington Street. It was later the residence of A.M. Loewenthal, an alderman in the local council. It was purchased by the New South Wales Government just before the First World War, then acquired by the Benevolent Society of New South Wales, who turned it into a children's welfare home known as Scarba House. This lasted until 1986, after which Scarba House became part of the Bondi Centre, which included a retirement village and various other welfare services. It is listed on the local government heritage register. Bondi Public School, located in Wellington Street, was built in 1883. It is also listed on the local government heritage register. Historically, the attractions in the area were Bondi Beach and the shopping centre at Bondi Junction (locally called 'the Junction'). The Bondi of this article developed as a predominantly residential area between the Junction and the beach, with a shopping strip along Bondi Road. Building styles are varied, with examples from the Victorian period (1840‚Äì1890), Federation (1890‚Äì1915), Inter-War (1915‚Äì1940) and contemporary. Terraces of Victorian shops alternate with Federation shops along Bondi Road. Waverley Rugby Club was founded in 1971 and is the local rugby union club, located in Bondi. Since its foundation, Waverley won the first Division Championship four times (in three of which won the First Grade title too); Second Division twice; and Third Division once.http://www.waverleyrugby.com.au/ Waverley Rugby Club, Bondi, Sydney =Trams= Tram services to North Bondi via Bondi Road and Campbell Parade from the CBD operated from either Circular Quay (via Bridge and Elizabeth Streets) or Railway Square (via Elizabeth and Liverpool Streets), to Oxford Street. The line then passed down Oxford Street to Bondi Junction, where it branched off from Bronte services, to run down Bondi Road to Fletcher Street, Campbell Parade and then to the North Bondi tram terminus. A feature of this line was the large three-track terminus cut into a hillside at North Bondi, which opened in 1946, as well as an underpass at 331a Bondi Road. Trams entered onto Campbell Parade via the underpass at a point where Bondi Road was too steep. The underpass and cutting have now been filled in, part of which is now public reserve and units.Remnants of the Sydney Trams . Bondivillage.com (2011-04-22).

One of the world's largest automotive museums, the Petersen Automotive Museum is a nonprofit organization specializing in automobile history and related educational programs. History Founded on June 11, 1994 by magazine publisher Robert E. Petersen and his wife Margie, the $40-million Petersen Automotive Museum is owned and operated by the Petersen Automotive Museum Foundation. The museum was originally located within the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, and later moved to a historic department store designed by Welton Becket. Opened in 1962, the building first served as a short-lived U.S. branch of Seibu Department Stores, before operating as an Ohrbach's department store from 1965 to 1986. Six years after Ohrbach's closed, Robert Petersen selected the largely windowless site as an ideal space for a museum‚Äîallowing artifacts to be displayed without harmful exposure to direct sunlight. In 2015, the museum underwent an extensive $125 million renovation. The building's fa√ßade was redesigned by the architectural firm Kohn Pedersen Fox, and features a stainless-steel ribbon assembly made of 100 tons of 14-gauge type 304 steel in 308 sections, 25 supports and 140,000 custom stainless-steel screws. An Interpretive Master Plan, performed by ObjectIDEA and Brent Johnson Design, re-envisioned the exhibition program and re-organized the collection as three museum experiences under one roof: \\"The History, Industry, and Artistry of the Automobile.\\" Designers at The Scenic Route configured interior spaces to accommodate changing exhibits.

Roughly speaking, the tensor product is the metric space completion of the ordinary tensor product. This is an example of a topological tensor product. The tensor product allows Hilbert spaces to be collected into a symmetric monoidal category.B. Coecke and E. O. Paquette, Categories for the practising physicist, in: New Structures for Physics, B. Coecke (ed.), Springer Lecture Notes in Physics, 2009. arXiv:0905.3010 Definition Since Hilbert spaces have inner products, one would like to introduce an inner product, and therefore a topology, on the tensor product that arise naturally from those of the factors. Let H1 and H2 be two Hilbert spaces with inner products \\\\langle \\\\cdot,\\\\cdot\\\\rangle_1 and \\\\langle \\\\cdot,\\\\cdot\\\\rangle_2, respectively. Construct the tensor product of H1 and H2 as vector spaces as explained in the article on tensor products. We can turn this vector space tensor product into an inner product space by defining : \\\\langle\\\\phi_1\\\\otimes\\\\phi_2,\\\\psi_1\\\\otimes\\\\psi_2\\\\rangle = \\\\langle\\\\phi_1,\\\\psi_1\\\\rangle_1 \\\\, \\\\langle\\\\phi_2,\\\\psi_2\\\\rangle_2 \\\\quad \\\\mbox{for all } \\\\phi_1,\\\\psi_1 \\\\in H_1 \\\\mbox{ and } \\\\phi_2,\\\\psi_2 \\\\in H_2 and extending by linearity. That this inner product is the natural one is justified by the identification of scalar-valued bilinear maps on H1 √ó H2 and linear functionals on their vector space tensor product. Finally, take the completion under this inner product. The resulting Hilbert space is the tensor product of H1 and H2. =Explicit construction= The tensor product can also be defined without appealing to the metric space completion. If H1 and H2 are two Hilbert spaces, one associates to every simple tensor product x_1 \\\\otimes x_2 the rank one operator from H_1^* to H2 that maps a given x^*\\\\in H^*_1 as : x^* \\\\mapsto x^*(x_1) \\\\, x_2 This extends to a linear identification between H_1 \\\\otimes H_2 and the space of finite rank operators from H_1^* to H2. The finite rank operators are embedded in the Hilbert space HS(H_1^*, H_2) of Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt operators from H_1^* to H2. The scalar product in HS(H_1^*, H_2) is given by :\\\\langle T_1, T_2 \\\\rangle = \\\\sum_n \\\\left \\\\langle T_1 e_n^*, T_2 e_n^* \\\\right \\\\rangle, where (e_n^*) is an arbitrary orthonormal basis of H_1^*. Under the preceding identification, one can define the Hilbertian tensor product of H1 and H2, that is isometrically and linearly isomorphic to HS(H_1^*, H_2). =Universal property= The Hilbert tensor product H=H_1\\\\otimes H_2 is characterized by the following universal property : :There is a weakly Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt mapping p : H1 √ó H2 ‚Üí H such that, given any weakly Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt mapping L : H1 √ó H2 ‚Üí K to a Hilbert space K, there is a unique bounded operator T : H ‚Üí K such that L = Tp. A weakly Hilbert-Schmidt mapping L : H1 √ó H2 ‚Üí K is defined as a bilinear map for which a real number d exists, such that :\\\\sum_{i,j=1}^\\\\infty \\\\big \\\\left \\\\langle L(e_i, f_j), u \\\\right \\\\rangle\\\\big^2 \\\\le d^2\\\\,\\\\u\\\\^2 for all u \\\\in K and one (hence all) orthonormal basis e1, e2, ... of H1 and f1, f2, ... of H2. As with any universal property, this characterizes the tensor product H uniquely, up to isomorphism. The same universal property, with obvious modifications, also applies for the tensor product of any finite number of Hilbert spaces. It is essentially the same universal property shared by all definitions of tensor products, irrespective of the spaces being tensored: this implies that any space with a tensor product is a symmetric monoidal category, and Hilbert spaces are a particular example thereof. =Infinite tensor products= If H_n is a collection of Hilbert spaces and \\\\xi_n is a collection of unit vectors in these Hilbert spaces then the incomplete tensor product (or Guichardet tensor product) is the L^2 completion of the set of all finite linear combinations of simple tensor vectors \\\\otimes_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\psi_n where all but finitely many of the \\\\psi_n's equal the corresponding \\\\xi_n.Bratteli, O. and Robinson, D: Operator Algebras and Quantum Statistical Mechanics v.1, 2nd ed., page 144. Springer-Verlag, 2002. =Operator algebras= Let \\\\mathfrak{A}_i be the von Neumann algebra of bounded operators on H_i for i=1,2. Then the von Neumann tensor product of the von Neumann algebras is the strong completion of the set of all finite linear combinations of simple tensor products A_1\\\\otimes A_2 where A_i \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{A}_i for i=1,2. This is exactly equal to the von Neumann algebra of bounded operators of H_1\\\\otimes H_2. Unlike for Hilbert spaces, one may take infinite tensor products of von Neumann algebras, and for that matter C*-algebras of operators, without defining reference states. This is one advantage of the \\"algebraic\\" method in quantum statistical mechanics. Properties If H_1 and H_2 have orthonormal bases \\\\\\\\{\\\\phi_k\\\\\\\\} and \\\\\\\\{\\\\psi_l\\\\\\\\}, respectively, then \\\\\\\\{\\\\phi_k\\\\otimes\\\\psi_l\\\\\\\\} is an orthonormal basis for H_1\\\\otimes H_2. In particular, the Hilbert dimension of the tensor product is the product (as cardinal numbers) of the Hilbert dimensions. Examples and applications The following examples show how tensor products arise naturally. Given two measure spaces X and Y, with measures \\\\mu and u respectively, one may look at L^2(X\\\\times Y), the space of functions on X\\\\times Y that are square integrable with respect to the product measure \\\\mu\\\\times u. If f is a square integrable function on X, and g is a square integrable function on Y, then we can define a function h on X\\\\times Y by h(x,y)=f(x)g(y). The definition of the product measure ensures that all functions of this form are square integrable, so this defines a bilinear mapping L^2(X)\\\\times L^2(Y)\\\\to L^2(X\\\\times Y). Linear combinations of functions of the form f(x)g(y) are also in L^2(X\\\\times Y). It turns out that the set of linear combinations is in fact dense in L^2(X\\\\times Y), if L^2(X) and L^2(Y) are separable. This shows that L^2(X)\\\\otimes L^2(Y) is isomorphic to L^2(X\\\\times Y), and it also explains why we need to take the completion in the construction of the Hilbert space tensor product. Similarly, we can show that L^2(X;H), denoting the space of square integrable functions X\\\\to H, is isomorphic to L^2(X)\\\\otimes H if this space is separable. The isomorphism maps f(x)\\\\otimes\\\\phi\\\\in L^2(X)\\\\otimes H to f(x)\\\\phi\\\\in L^2(X;H) We can combine this with the previous example and conclude that L^2(X)\\\\otimes L^2(Y) and L^2(X\\\\times Y) are both isomorphic to L^2(X;L^2(Y)). Tensor products of Hilbert spaces arise often in quantum mechanics. If some particle is described by the Hilbert space H_1, and another particle is described by H_2, then the system consisting of both particles is described by the tensor product of H_1 and H_2. For example, the state space of a quantum harmonic oscillator is L^2(\\\\R), so the state space of two oscillators is L^2(\\\\R)\\\\otimes L^2(\\\\R), which is isomorphic to L^2(\\\\R^2). Therefore, the two-particle system is described by wave functions of the form \\\\psi(x_1,x_2). A more intricate example is provided by the Fock spaces, which describe a variable number of particles.  References Bibliography * . * .

Its postcode is 2226, which it shares with neighbouring Jannali and Como. Bonnet Bay is located on the eastern bank of the Woronora River, which flows north into the Georges River. The suburb draws its name from the adjacent bay of the same name. History The original name proposed for the area was Kirkby. A cave in the area was known as 'The Bonnet' because it was shaped like a bonnet and this was adopted for the name of the bay on the Woronora River. The Geographical Names Board decided to name the area Bonnet Bay in 1969. Construction started in late 1969 at Fillmore Rd. completion of all house plots in 1985. In late 1976 the area was legally referred to as the witch pit due to high percentages of witch households in the area.History of Sutherland Shire Placenames Demographics According to the 2011 census of Population, there were 2,133 residents in Bonnet Bay. In Bonnet Bay, 79.0% of people were born in Australia. The other most common countries of birth were England 5.7%, New Zealand 1.3%, China (excludes SARs and Taiwan) 0.7%, Germany 0.7% and Ireland 0.7%. 90.0% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Spanish 0.9%, Greek 0.7%, Italian 0.6%, Mandarin 0.5% and German 0.4%. The most common responses for religion in Bonnet Bay were Catholic 31.9%, Anglican 25.1%, No Religion 15.4%, Uniting Church 5.7% and Presbyterian and Reformed 3.6%. Landmarks Burnum Burnum Reserve lies between Bonnet Bay, Como, Jannali, Sutherland and Woronora. It extends for about two kilometres. The reserve effectively surrounds Bonnet Bay, with the only two roads leading into the suburb, cutting through it. Burnum Burnum Reserve hosts some plants that are almost extinct and are protected. However, it also represents a constant fire threat to Bonnet Bay, most notably manifesting in the 1994 Como bushfires. The reserve was originally known as \\"Jannali Reserve\\" but the name was changed in 2005 to commemorate Burnum Burnum, the prominent aboriginal Sutherland Shire resident. A small plaque details his speech in England at Australia's bicentenary in 1988. A noteworthy feature of this suburb is that all of the streets are named after American Presidents. Washington Drive runs through the length of the suburb and is twice split into one-way 'Upper' and 'Lower' sections due to the steep hills it runs across. Nixon is the last President a street is named after. The only street not named after an American president is Tudar Road, which originates in NW Sutherland and cuts through Burnum Burnum reserve to enter Bonnet Bay. Commercial area Bonnet Bay is mostly residential, with a small shopping centre located in Kennedy Crescent, known as the Bonnet Bay Shopping Village. Bonnet Bay Public School is located on Tudar Road. Recreation Bonnet Bay has a boat ramp, a number of picnic and recreational areas, including a cricket oval, soccer oval, two netball courts, two tennis courts and two baseball fields. Events Bonnet Bay was well known in southern Sydney for its extensive displays of Christmas decorations and lights during the festive season, though the tradition reached its peak in the mid-1980s and has since spread to other areas throughout the Sutherland Shire.

PACTOR is an evolution of both AMTOR and packet radio; its name is a portmanteau of these two technologies' names. PACTOR uses a combination of simple FSK modulation, and the ARQ protocol for robust error detection and data throughput. Generational improvements to PACTOR include PACTOR II, PACTOR III, and PACTOR IV which are capable of higher speed transmission. PACTOR is most commonly used on frequencies between 1 MHz and 30 MHz.  History  PACTOR (Latin: The mediator) was developed by Special Communications Systems GmbH (SCS) and released to the public in 1991. PACTOR was developed in order to improve the reception of digital data when the received signal was weak or noisy. It combines the bandwidth efficiency of packet radio with the error-correction (CRC) and automatic repeat request (ARQ) of AMTOR. Amateur radio operators were instrumental in developing and implementing these digital modes. Current uses PACTOR radio equipment consists of an HF transceiver, a computer and a terminal node controller. Software running on the computer drives the terminal node controller. The most commonly used amateur program for this purpose is Airmail. PACTOR is used by Amateur Bulletin board system operators to exchange public messages, and open conversations across the world. It is also used by the NTSD (digital) portion of the ARRL's National Traffic System (NTS) to pass digital ARRL Radiograms. Newer PACTOR modes are used to transfer large binary data files and Internet e-mail, particularly via the Winlink global e-mail system. The SailMail network transfers e-mail on behalf of marine stations.  Technical characteristics  PACTOR is a set of standardized modes used by Amateur and Marine radio operators for FSK radioteletype transfer of digital information over shortwave bands. HF data transmission by radio amateurs uses medium power (~100 Watts) over long distances (100 to 4000 km). Effective radio-frequency communications over such long distances over hostile radio paths require that special attention be paid to the rate at which data is repeated and error correction. To reduce the amount of data sent, on-line data compression is utilized, along with memory ARQ error correction. By combining these open technologies, PACTOR achieves a power efficiency much greater than that of older protocols such as packet, AMTOR, or RTTY. PACTOR has a very narrow waveform and occupies the same band space as analog 300 baud packet. PACTOR utilizes very rapid time-division duplexing, giving PACTOR communications its characteristic cricket-like chirping sound when listened through a single- sideband (SSB) receiver. Depending on the version of PACTOR protocol used and the radio-frequency conditions, PACTOR transmission speeds range from 20 to 5200 bits per second (bit/s; net rate) or 9000 bit/s gross rate utilizing speed 10 (32-QAM). The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) emission designators: * Pactor I is 304HF1B. * Pactor II is 375HJ2D (at a symbol rate of 100 symbols per second). * Pactor III is 2K20J2D (at a symbol rate of 100 symbols per second). * Pactor IV is 2K40J2D (at a symbol rate of 1800 symbols per second).  Availability and monitoring  A robust network of PACTOR stations has been established to transfer data between radio stations and the Internet, extending Internet access to sea-based and other isolated users, led by volunteers involved with Winlink, under the auspicies of ARSFI (a Florida- based non-profit organization). Pactor modes other than level 1 (P1) are not open source, but are publicly documented and can be monitored and decoded easily over the air by third parties using free Raspberry Pi software (\\"PMON for Raspberry Pi\\") or PMON utility on the modem itself.

Its closest major regional centre is Liverpool. The suburb is shaped like a diamond. The suburbs of Mount Pritchard and Cabramatta West lie to the east on the other side of Green Valley Creek. St Johns Park, Greenfield Park and Edensor Park lie to the north. Bonnyrigg Heights, Hinchinbrook and Green Valley are to the west. Busby and Heckenberg lie to the south. Currently the town centre is undergoing a major regeneration through a new housing scheme - Newleaf Bonnyrigg. This will replace over 800 dwellings with 2,330 new homes that will see the town's population increase by over 3,000 people over 12 years to 2022. The project is being delivered through a Public Private Partnership with Housing New South Wales called Newleaf. Commercial area The Assyrian genocide monument is a memorial site for the Assyrian community. Bonnyrigg's commercial area consists of a main hub around Bonnyrigg Plaza, a shopping centre located on Bonnyrigg Avenue. Bonnyrigg Plaza has undergone major renovation allowing new stores and a fresh new food court to come in. This commercial area also has several community facilities such as a PCYC, an office of the Housing NSW department and a public library. A Bunnings hardware store is located opposite to the plaza and the local primary school is adjacent to Bonnyrigg Plaza. Brown Road in Bonnyrigg is also a commercial area, albeit smaller. It contains several mixed business Asian stores, a Vietnamese and Chinese restaurant and take away, newsagency and Liberty petrol station.

Due to North and South America's geographical separation from the central theaters of conflict (in Europe, the Mediterranean and the Pacific and Asia) the threat of an invasion of the continental U.S. or other areas in the Americas by the Axis Powers was negligible and the theater saw relatively little conflict. However, despite the relative unimportance of the American Theater, some battles took place within it, including the Battle of the River Plate, submarine attacks off the East Coast, the Aleutian Islands campaign, the Battle of the St. Lawrence, and the attacks on Newfoundland. German operationsSouth America= Admiral Graf Spee burning and sinking off Montevideo See also Latin America during World War II Battle of the River Plate The first naval battle during the war was fought on December 13, 1939, off the Atlantic coast of South America. The German \\"pocket battleship\\" (acting as a commerce raider) encountered one of the British naval units searching for her. Composed of three Royal Navy cruisers, , , and , the unit was patrolling off the River Plate estuary of Argentina and Uruguay. In a bloody engagement, Admiral Graf Spee successfully repulsed the British attacks. Captain Hans Langsdorff then brought his damaged ship to shelter in neutral Uruguay for repairs. However, British intelligence successfully deceived Langsdorff into believing that a much superior British force had now gathered to wait for him, and he scuttled his ship at Montevideo to save his crew's lives before committing suicide. German combat losses were 96 killed or wounded, against 72 British sailors killed and 28 wounded. Two Royal Navy cruisers had been severely damaged. Submarine warfare U-199 under attack by Brazilian Air Force PBY Catalina, 31 July 1943. U-boat operations in the region (centered in the Atlantic Narrows between Brazil and West Africa) began in autumn 1940. After negotiations with Brazilian Foreign Minister Osvaldo Aranha (on behalf of dictator Get√∫lio Vargas), the U.S. introduced its Air Force along Brazil's coast in the second half of 1941. Germany and Italy subsequently extended their submarine attacks to include Brazilian ships wherever they were, and from April 1942 were found in Brazilian waters. On 22 May 1942, the first Brazilian attack (although unsuccessful) was carried out by Brazilian Air Force aircraft on the . After a series of attacks on merchant vessels off the Brazilian coast by , Brazil officially entered the war on 22 August 1942, offering an important addition to the Allied strategic position in the South Atlantic. Although the Brazilian Navy was small, it had modern minelayers suitable for coastal convoy escort and aircraft which needed only small modifications to become suitable for maritime patrol. During its three years of war, mainly in Caribbean and South Atlantic, alone and in conjunction with the U.S., Brazil escorted 3,167 ships in 614 convoys, totalling 16,500,000 tons, with losses of 0.1%.Votaw, 1950, p. 10579ff, and 1951, p.93. Brazil saw three of its warships sunk and 486 men killed in action (332 in the cruiser Bahia); 972 seamen and civilian passengers were also lost aboard the 32 Brazilian merchant vessels attacked by enemy submarines. American and Brazilian air and naval forces worked closely together until the end of the Battle. One example was the sinking of in July 1943, by a coordinated action of Brazilian and American aircraft.Gastaldoni, 1993. From p.153. Only in Brazilian waters, eleven other Axis submarines were known sunk between January and September 1943‚Äîthe Italian Archimede and ten German boats: , , , , , , , , , and . By late 1943, the decreasing number of Allied shipping losses in South Atlantic coincided with the increasing elimination of Axis submarines operating there. From then, the battle in the region was lost for Germans, even with the most of remaining submarines in the region receiving official order of withdrawal only in August of the following year, and with (Baron Jedburgh) the last Allied merchant ship sunk by a U-boat (U-532) there, on 10 March 1945. =United States=Duquesne Spy Ring Fritz Joubert Duquesne, FBI file photo Even before the war, a large Nazi spy ring was found operating in the United States. The Duquesne Spy Ring is still the largest espionage case in United States history that ended in convictions. The 33 German agents who formed the Duquesne spy ring were placed in key jobs in the United States to get information that could be used in the event of war and to carry out acts of sabotage. One man opened a restaurant and used his position to get information from his customers; another worked at an airline so he could report Allied ships crossing the Atlantic Ocean; others in the ring worked as deliverymen so they could deliver secret messages alongside normal messages. The ring was led by Captain Fritz Joubert Duquesne, a South African Boer who spied for Germany in both World Wars and is best known as \\"The man who killed Kitchener\\" after he was awarded the Iron Cross for his key role in the sabotage and sinking of in 1916. William G. Sebold, a double agent for the United States, was a major factor in the FBI's successful resolution of this case. For nearly two years, Sebold ran a secret radio station in New York for the ring. Sebold provided the FBI with information on what Germany was sending to its spies in the United States while allowing the FBI to control the information that was being transmitted to Germany. On June 29, 1941, six months before the U.S. declared war, the FBI acted. All 33 spies were arrested, found or pled guilty, and sentenced to serve a total of over 300 years in prison.https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/duquesne-spy-ring Operation Pastorius After declaring war on the United States following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Adolf Hitler ordered the remaining German saboteurs to wreak havoc on America.(Including Canada, the Germans not distinguishing between the overseas enemy; see ) The responsibility for carrying this out was given to German Intelligence (Abwehr). In the spring of 1942, nine agents were recruited (one eventually dropping out) and divided into two teams. The first, commanded by George John Dasch, included Ernst Peter Burger, Heinrich Heinck, and Richard Quirin; the second, under command of Edward Kerling, included Hermann Neubauer, Werner Thiel, and Herbert Haupt. On June 12, 1942, the landed Dasch's team with explosives and plans at Amagansett, New York. Their mission was to destroy power plants at Niagara Falls and three Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA) factories in Illinois, Tennessee, and New York. However, Dasch instead turned himself in to the FBI, providing them with a complete list of his team members and an account of the planned missions, which led to their arrests. On June 17, Kerling's team landed from U-584 at Ponte Vedra Beach, south-east of Jacksonville, Florida. They were ordered to place mines in four areas: the Pennsylvania Railroad in Newark, New Jersey; canal sluices in both St. Louis, Missouri, and Cincinnati, Ohio; and New York City's water supply pipes. The team members made their way to Cincinnati and then split up, two going to Chicago, Illinois, and the others to New York. Dasch's confession led to the arrest of all of the men by July 10. Because the German agents were captured in civilian clothes (though they had landed in uniforms), they were tried by a military tribunal in Washington D.C., with six of them sentenced to death for spying. President Franklin D. Roosevelt approved the sentences. The constitutionality of military tribunals was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in Ex parte Quirin on July 31, and the six men were executed by electrocution at the D.C. jail on August 8. Dasch and Burger were given thirty-year prison sentences because they had turned themselves in to the FBI and provided information about the others. Both were released in 1948 and deported to Germany. (from internet archive) Dasch (aka George Davis), who had been a longtime American resident before the war, suffered a difficult life in Germany after his return from U.S. custody because he had betrayed his comrades to the U.S. authorities. As a condition of his deportation, he was not permitted to return to the United States, even though he spent many years writing letters to prominent American authorities (J. Edgar Hoover, President Eisenhower, etc.) seeking permission to return. He eventually moved to Switzerland and wrote a book, titled Eight Spies Against America. Operation Magpie In 1944 another attempt at infiltration was made, codenamed Operation Elster (\\"Magpie\\"). Elster involved Erich Gimpel and German-American defector William Colepaugh. Their mission's objective was to gather intelligence on a variety of military subjects and transmit it back to Germany by a radio to be constructed by Gimpel. They sailed from Kiel on and landed at Hancock Point, Maine, on November 29, 1944. Both then made their way to New York, but the operation soon collapsed. Colepaugh lost his nerve and turned himself in to the FBI on December 26, confessing the whole plan and naming Gimpel. Gimpel was then arrested four days later in New York. Both men were sentenced to death, but eventually their sentences were commuted. Gimpel spent 10 years in prison, while Colepaugh was released in 1960 and operated a business in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, before he retired to Florida. =German landings in Canada=St. Martins, New Brunswick One month earlier than the Dasch operation (on May 14, 1942), a solitary Abwehr agent, Marius A. Langbein, was landed by a U-boat () near St. Martins, New Brunswick, Canada. His mission, codenamed Operation Grete, after the name of the agent's wife, was to observe and report shipping movements at Montreal and Halifax, Nova Scotia (the main departure port for North Atlantic convoys). Langbein, who had lived in Canada before the war, changed his mind and moved to Ottawa, where he lived off his Abwehr funds until he surrendered to the Canadian authorities in December 1944. A jury found Langbein not guilty of spying, since he had never committed any hostile acts against Canada during the war.http://www.german- navy.de/kriegsmarine/articles/feature2.html Kriegsmarine articleThe most thorough treatment to date is probably Dean Beeby, Cargo of Lies: The True Story of a Nazi Double Agent in Canada, University of Toronto Press, 1996, pp. 140‚Äì166 (Chapter 7) New Carlisle, Quebec RCMP booking photo of Janowski In November 1942, sank two iron ore freighters and damaged another off Bell Island in Conception Bay, Newfoundland, en route to the Gasp√© Peninsula where, despite an attack by a Royal Canadian Air Force aircraft, it successfully landed a spy, Werner von Janowski, four miles (6.5 km) from New Carlisle, Quebec, at around 5am on November 9, 1942.See Michael Hadley (1985), U-boats against Canada, McGill Queens University Press, 1985, pp. 149‚Äì162; and . Von Janowski showed up at the New Carlisle Hotel at 06:30 and checked in under the alias of William Brenton. The son of the hotel owner, Earle Annett Jr., grew suspicious of him, due to inconsistencies with the German spy's story. He used an out-of-circulation Canadian note when paying his bill to the owner's son and when he left to wait at the train station the suspicious son of the hotelier followed him. There Annett grew more suspicious and he alerted a Quebec Provincial Police constable, Alfonse Duchesneau, who quickly boarded the train as it pulled away from the station and began searching for the stranger. Duchesneau located von Janowski, who said he was a radio salesman from Toronto. He stuck with this story until the policeman asked to search his bags; the stranger then confessed: \\"That will not be necessary. I am a German officer who serves his country as you do yourself.\\" Essex, James W. 2004. Victory in the St. Lawrence: the unknown u-boat war. Erin, Ontario: Boston Mills Press Inspection of von Janowski's personal effects upon his arrest revealed that he was carrying a powerful radio transmitter, among other things. Von Janowski spent the next year as a double agent, codenamed WATCHDOG by the Allies and Bobbi by the Abwehr, sending false messages to Germany under the joint control of the RCMP and MI5, with spymaster Cyril Mills having been seconded to Canada to assist in the double cross initiative.See The effectiveness and honesty of his \\"turn\\" is a matter of some dispute. For example, John Cecil Masterman wrote in The Double Cross System: \\"In November, WATCHDOG was landed from a U-boat in Canada together with a wireless set and an extensive questionnaire. This move on the part of the Germans threatened an extension of our activities to other parts of the world, but in fact the case did not develop very satisfactorily... WATCHDOG was closed down in the summer [of 1943].\\"Cecil Masterman, The Double Cross System, New Haven: Yale University Press, 1972, p. 121, 144 =German landings in Newfoundland=Weather Station Kurt, Martin Bay Accurate weather reporting was important to the sea war and on September 18, 1943, sailed from Kiel, via Bergen, Norway, with a meteorological team led by Professor Kurt Sommermeyer. They landed at Martin Bay, a remote location near the northern tip of Labrador on October 22, 1943, and successfully set up an automatic weather station (\\"Weather Station Kurt\\" or \\"Wetter-Funkger√§t Land-26\\"), despite the constant risk of Allied air patrols. The station was powered by batteries that were expected to last about three months. At the beginning of July 1944, left Bergen to replace the equipment, but was sunk en route. The weather station remained at the site until it was recovered in the 1980s and placed in the Canadian War Museum. =U-boat operations=Atlantic Ocean The Atlantic Ocean was a major strategic battle zone (the \\"Battle of the Atlantic\\") and when Germany declared war on the U.S., the East Coast of the United States offered easy pickings for German U-boats (referred to as the \\"Second Happy Time\\"). After a highly successful foray by five Type IX long- range U-boats, the offensive was maximized by the use of short-range Type VII U-boats, with increased fuel stores, replenished from supply U-boats called Milchk√ºhe (milk cows). From February to May 1942, 348 ships were sunk, for the loss of two U-boats during April and May. U.S. naval commanders were reluctant to introduce the convoy system that had protected trans-Atlantic shipping and, without coastal blackouts, shipping was silhouetted against the bright lights of American towns and cities such as Atlantic City until a dim-out was ordered in May. The cumulative effect of this campaign was severe; a quarter of all wartime sinkings ‚Äì 3.1 million tons. There were several reasons for this. The American naval commander, Admiral Ernest King, as an apparent anglophobe, was averse to taking British recommendations to introduce convoys, U.S. Coast Guard and Navy patrols were predictable and could be avoided by U-boats, inter-service co-operation was poor, and the U.S. Navy did not possess enough suitable escort vessels (British and Canadian warships were transferred to the U.S. east coast). U.S. East Coast Several ships were torpedoed within sight of East Coast cities such as New York and Boston. The only documented World War II sinking of a U-boat close to New England shores occurred on May 5, 1945, when the torpedoed and sank the collier off Newport, Rhode Island. When Black Point was hit, the U.S. Navy immediately chased down the sub and began dropping depth charges. In recent years, U-853 has become a popular dive site. Its intact hull, with open hatches, is located in of water off Block Island, Rhode Island. A wreck discovered in 1991 off the New Jersey coast was concluded in 1997 to be that of . Previously, U-869 had been thought to have been sunk off Rabat, Morocco.. U.S. Gulf of Mexico Once convoys and air cover were introduced in the Atlantic, sinking numbers were reduced and the U-boats shifted to attack shipping in the Gulf of Mexico. During 1942 and 1943, more than 20 U-boats operated in the Gulf of Mexico. They attacked tankers transporting oil from ports in Texas and Louisiana, successfully sinking 56 vessels. By the end of 1943, the U-boat attacks diminished as the merchant ships began to travel in armed convoys. In one instance, the tanker Virginia was torpedoed in the mouth of the Mississippi River by the on May 12, 1942, killing 26 crewmen. There were 14 survivors. Again, when defensive measures were introduced, ship sinkings decreased. was the only U-boat sunk in the Gulf of Mexico during the war. Once thought to have been sunk by a torpedo dropped from a U.S. Coast Guard Utility Amphibian J4F aircraft on August 1, 1942, U-166 is now believed to have been sunk two days earlier by depth charges from the passenger ship 's naval escort, the U.S. Navy sub-chaser, PC-566. It is thought that the J4F aircraft may have spotted and attacked another German submarine, , which was operating in the area at the same time. U-166 lies in of water within a mile (1,600 m) of her last victim, Robert E. Lee. Canada From the start of the war in 1939 until VE Day, several of Canada's Atlantic coast ports became important to the resupply effort for the United Kingdom and later for the Allied land offensive on the Western Front. Halifax and Sydney, Nova Scotia, became the primary convoy assembly ports, with Halifax being assigned the fast or priority convoys (largely troops and essential material) with the more modern merchant ships, while Sydney was given slow convoys which conveyed bulkier material on older and more vulnerable merchant ships. Both ports were heavily fortified with shore radar emplacements, searchlight batteries, and extensive coastal artillery stations all manned by RCN and Canadian Army regular and reserve personnel. Military intelligence agents enforced strict blackouts throughout the areas and anti- torpedo nets were in place at the harbor entrances, making a direct attack on those facilities unfeasible due to the impossibility for Germany to provide air support. Even though no landings of German personnel took place near these ports, there were frequent attacks by U-boats on convoys departing for Europe once these had reached the mouth of the St. Lawrence. Less extensively used, but no less important, was the port of Saint John which also saw mat√©riel funneled through the port, largely after the United States entered the war in December 1941. The port's location within the protected waters of the Bay of Fundy made it a difficult target for attack. The Canadian Pacific Railway mainline from central Canada (which crossed the state of Maine) could be used to transport in aid of the war effort. Although not crippling to the Canadian war effort, given the country's rail network to the east coast ports, but possibly more destructive to the morale of the Canadian public, was the Battle of the St. Lawrence, when U-boats began to venture upriver and attack domestic coastal shipping along Canada's east coast in the St. Lawrence River and Gulf of St. Lawrence from early 1942 through to the end of the shipping season in late 1944. From a German perspective this area contained most of the military assets in North America that could realistically be targeted for attack, and therefore the St. Lawrence was the only zone that saw consistent warfare‚Äîalbeit on a limited scale‚Äîin North America during World War II. Residents along the Gasp√© coast and the St. Lawrence River and Gulf of St. Lawrence were startled at the sight of maritime warfare off their shores, with ships on fire and explosions rattling their communities, while bodies and debris floated ashore. The number of military losses is not known, although loose estimates can be made based on the number of surface units and submarines sunk. Newfoundland Five significant attacks on Newfoundland took place in 1942. On 3 March 1942, launched three torpedoes at St. John's; one hit Fort Amherst and two more hit the cliffs of Signal Hill below Cabot Tower. In autumn German U-boats attacked four iron ore carriers serving the DOSCO iron mine at Wabana on Bell Island in Newfoundland's Conception Bay. The ships SS Saganaga and SS Lord Strathcona were sunk by on 5 September 1942, while SS Rosecastle and P.L.M 27 were sunk by on 2 November with the loss of 69 lives. After the sinkings the submarine fired a torpedo that missed its target, the 3,000-ton collier Anna T, and struck the DOSCO loading pier and exploded. On 14 October 1942, the Newfoundland Railway ferry was torpedoed by and sunk in the Cabot Strait south of Port aux Basques. Caribou was carrying 45 crew and 206 civilian and military passengers. 137 lost their lives, many of them Newfoundlanders. Half a dozen U-boat wrecks lie in waters around Newfoundland and Labrador, due to Canadian patrols. Caribbean A German submarine shelled the American Standard Oil refinery at the San Nicolas harbour and the \\"Arend\\"/\\"Eagle\\" Maatschappij (from the Dutch/British Shell Co.) near the Oranjestad harbour situated on the Island of Aruba (a Dutch colony) and some ships that were near the entrance to Lake Maracaibo on February 16, 1942. Three tankers, including the Venezuelan Monagas, were sunk. A Venezuelan gunboat, , assisted in rescuing the crews. A German submarine shelled the island of Mona, some from the main island of Puerto Rico, on March 2. Japanese operationsAleutian Islands Campaign= military propaganda poster from 1942/43 for Thirteenth Naval District, United States Navy, showing a rat dressed in stereotypical attire representing Imperial Japan, approaching a mousetrap labeled \\"Army ‚Äì Navy ‚Äì Civilian\\", on a background map of the Alaska Territory, referred to as future \\"Death-Trap For The Jap\\" On June 3‚Äì4, 1942, Japanese planes from two light carriers and struck the continental U.S. for the first time against the city of Unalaska, Alaska, at Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands. Originally, the Japanese planned to attack Dutch Harbor simultaneously with its attack on Midway but it occurred a day earlier due to one-day delay. The attack only did moderate damage on Dutch Harbor, but 43 Americans were killed and 50 others wounded in the attack. On June 6, two days after the bombing of Dutch Harbor, 500 Japanese marines landed on Kiska, one of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska. Upon landing, they killed two and captured eight United States Navy officers, then seized control of American soil for the first time. The next day, a total of 1,140 Japanese infantrymen landed on Attu via Holtz Bay, eventually reaching Massacre Bay and Chichagof Harbor. Attu's population at the time consisted of 45 Alaska Native Aleuts, and two white Americans ‚Äì Charles Foster Jones, a 60-year-old ham radio operator and weather observer, and his 62-year-old wife Etta, a teacher and nurse. The Japanese killed Charles Jones after interrogating him, while Etta Jones and the Aleut population were sent to Japan, where 19 of the Aleuts died and Etta survived the war. The Japanese landings were the only invasions of the United States during World War II and was the second time that American soil had been occupied by a foreign enemy, the first being the British during the War of 1812. A year after Japan's occupation of Kiska and Attu, U.S. troops invaded Attu on May 11, 1943 and successfully retook the island after three weeks of fighting, killing 2,351 Japanese combatants and taking only 28 as prisoners of war at the cost of 549 lives. Three months later on August 15, U.S. and Canadian forces landed on Kiska expecting the same resistance like Attu; they later found the entire island empty, as most of the Japanese forces secretly evacuated weeks before the landing. In spite of enemy absence on the island, over 313 Allied casualties were sustained nonetheless through car accidents, booby traps, landmines, and friendly fire, in which 28 Americans and four Canadians were killed in the exchange of fire between the two forces. =Submarine operations= Several ships were torpedoed within sight of West Coast Californian cities such as Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, San Diego, and Santa Monica. During 1941 and 1942, more than 10 Japanese submarines operated in the West Coast and Baja California. They attacked American, Canadian, and Mexican ships, successfully sinking over 10 vessels including the Soviet Navy submarine L-16 on October 11, 1942. Bombardment of Ellwood The United States continent was first shelled by the Axis on February 23, 1942, when the attacked the Ellwood Oil Field west of Goleta, near Santa Barbara, California. Although only a pumphouse and catwalk at one oil well were damaged, I-17 captain Nishino Kozo radioed Tokyo that he had left Santa Barbara in flames. No casualties were reported and the total cost of the damage was officially estimated at approximately $500‚Äì1,000. News of the shelling triggered an invasion scare along the West Coast.Young, Donald J. Phantom Japanese Raid on Los Angeles World War II Magazine, September 2003 Bombardment of Estevan Point Lighthouse More than five Japanese submarines operated in Western Canada during 1941 and 1942. On June 20, 1942, the , under the command of Yokota Minoru, fired 25‚Äì30 rounds of 5.5-inch shells at the Estevan Point lighthouse on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, but failed to hit its target. Though no casualties were reported, the subsequent decision to turn off the lights of outer stations caused difficulties for coastal shipping activity. Bombardment of Fort Stevens In what became the second attack on a continental American military installation during World War II, the , under the command of Tagami Meiji, surfaced near the mouth of the Columbia River in Oregon on the night of June 21 and June 22, 1942, and fired shells toward Fort Stevens. The only damage officially recorded was to a baseball field's backstop. Probably the most significant damage was a shell that damaged some large phone cables. The Fort Stevens gunners were refused permission to return fire for fear of revealing the guns' location and/or range limitations to the sub. American aircraft on training flights spotted the submarine, which was subsequently attacked by a US bomber, but escaped. Lookout Air Raids Nobuo Fujita standing by his E14Y The Lookout Air Raids occurred on September 9, 1942. The second location to be subject to aerial bombing in the continental United States by a foreign power occurred when an attempt to start a forest fire was made by a Japanese Yokosuka E14Y1 \\"Glen\\" seaplane dropping two incendiary bombs over Mount Emily, near Brookings, Oregon. The seaplane, piloted by Nobuo Fujita, had been launched from the Japanese submarine aircraft carrier I-25. No significant damage was officially reported following the attack, nor after a repeat attempt on September 29. =Fire balloon attacks= Mitchell MonumentBetween November 1944 and April 1945, the Japanese Navy launched over 9,000 fire balloons toward North America. Carried by the recently discovered Pacific jet stream, they were to sail over the Pacific Ocean and land in North America, where the Japanese hoped they would start forest fires and cause other damage. About three hundred were reported as reaching North America, but little damage was caused. Near Bly, Oregon, six people (five children and a woman) became the only deaths due to an enemy balloon bomb attack in the United States when a balloon bomb exploded. The site is marked by a stone monument at the Mitchell Recreation Area in the Fremont-Winema National Forest. A fire balloon is also considered to be a possible cause of the third fire in the Tillamook Burn in Oregon. One member of the 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion died while responding to a fire in the Umpqua National Forest near Roseburg, Oregon, on August 6, 1945; other casualties of the 555th were two fractures and 20 other injuries. Cancelled Axis operationsGermany= In 1940, the German Air Ministry secretly requested designs from the major German aircraft companies for its Amerikabomber program, in which a long-range strategic bomber would strike the continental United States from the Azores (more than away). Planning was complete in 1942 with the submittal of the program to Goering's RLM offices in March 1942, resulting in cogent piston-engined designs from Focke-Wulf, Heinkel, Junkers and Messerschmitt (who had built the ultra-long- range Messerschmitt Me 261 before WW II), but by mid-1944 the project had been abandoned as too expensive, with a serious increase in the need for defensive fighters, needing to come from Nazi Germany's by-then rapidly diminishing aviation production capacity. Hitler had ordered that biological warfare should be studied only for the purpose of defending against it. The head of the Science Division of the Wehrmacht, Erich Schumann, lobbied for Hitler to be persuaded otherwise: \\"America must be attacked simultaneously with various human and animal epidemic pathogens, as well as plant pests.\\" The plans were never adopted due to opposition by Hitler.Biologists Under Hitler Ute Deichmann, Thomas Dunlap Harvard University Press 1999, pages 279‚Äì282 =Italy= An Italian naval commander devised a plan to attack New York harbor with midget submarines; however, as the tides of war changed against Italy, the plan was postponed and later scrapped. =Japan= Just after the attack on Pearl Harbor, a force of seven Japanese submarines patrolled the United States West Coast. The Wolfpack made plans to bombard targets in California on Christmas Eve of 1941. However, the attack was postponed to December 27 and then canceled due to fears of American reprisal. The Japanese constructed a plan early in the Pacific War to attack the Panama Canal, a vital water passage in Panama, used during World War II primarily for the Allied supply effort. The Japanese attack was never launched due to crippling naval losses at the beginning of conflict with the United States and United Kingdom (See: Aichi M6A). The Imperial Japanese Army launched Project Z (also called the Z Bombers Project) in 1942, similar to the Nazi German Amerika Bomber project, to design an intercontinental bomber capable of reaching North America. The Project Z plane was to have six engines of 5,000 horsepower each; the Nakajima Aircraft Company quickly began developing engines for the plane, and proposed doubling HA-44 engines (the most powerful engine available in Japan) into a 36-cylinder engine. Designs were presented to the Imperial Japanese Army, including the Nakajima G10N, Kawasaki Ki-91, and Nakajima G5N. None developed beyond prototypes or wind tunnel models, save for the G5N. In 1945, the Z project and other heavy bomber projects were cancelled. During the final months of World War II, Japan had planned to use plague as a biological weapon against U.S. civilians in San Diego, California, during Operation Cherry Blossoms at Night. The plan was set to launch at night on September 22, 1945. However it was shelved due to the surrender of Japan on August 15, 1945. Other alarmsFalse alarms= These false alarms have generally been attributed to military and civilian inexperience with war and poor radars of the era. Critics have theorized they were a deliberate attempt by the Army to frighten the public in order to stimulate interest in war preparations.The Virtual Museum of The City of San Francisco THE ARMY AIR FORCES IN WORLD WAR II; DEFENSE OF THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE Alerts following Pearl Harbor On December 8, 1941, rumors of an enemy carrier off the coast led to the closing of schools in Oakland, California, a blackout enforced by local wardens and radio silence followed that evening. The reports reaching Washington of an attack on San Francisco were regarded as credible. The affair was described as a test but Lt. Gen. John L. DeWitt of the Western Defense Command said \\"Last night there were planes over this community. They were enemy planes! I mean Japanese planes! And they were tracked out to sea. You think it was a hoax? It is damned nonsense for sensible people to assume that the Army and Navy would practice such a hoax on San Francisco.\\" Rumors continued on the West Coast in the following days. An alert of a similar nature occurred in the Northeast on December 9. At noon advices were received that hostile planes were only two hours‚Äô distance away. Although there was no general hysteria, fighter aircraft from Mitchel Field on Long Island took the air to intercept the \\"raiders\\". Wall Street had its worst sell off since the Fall of France, school children in New York City were sent home and several radio stations left the air. In Boston police shifted heavy stores of guns and ammunition from storage vaults to stations throughout the city, and industrial establishments were advised to prepare for a raid. Battle of Los Angeles The Battle of Los Angeles, also known as \\"The Great Los Angeles Air Raid\\", is the name given by contemporary sources to the imaginary enemy attack and subsequent anti- aircraft artillery barrage which took place in 1942 from February 24 and early on February 25 over Los Angeles, California. Initially, the target of the aerial barrage was thought to be an attacking force from Japan, but Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox speaking at a press conference shortly afterward called the incident a \\"false alarm.\\" Newspapers of the time published a number of sensational reports and speculations of a cover-up. When documenting the incident in 1983, the U.S. Office of Air Force History attributed the event to a case of \\"war nerves\\" likely triggered by a lost weather balloon and exacerbated by stray flares and shell bursts from adjoining batteries. =Minor alerts=1942 In May and June the San Francisco Bay Area underwent a series of alerts: *May 12: A twenty-five-minute air-raid alert. *May 27: West Coast defenses put on alert after Army codebreakers learned that the Japanese intended a series of hit-and-run attacks in reprisal for the Doolittle Raid. *May 31: The battleships and USS Maryland set sail from the Golden Gate to form a line of defense against any Japanese attack mounted on San Francisco. *June 2: A nine-minute air-raid alert, including at 9:22 pm a radio silence order applied to all radio stations from Mexico to Canada.

The brothers were influential in the mid-19th century, in both scientific and political circles.  Biography  Chambers was born in Peebles and moved to Edinburgh in 1814 to work in the book-selling trade and soon branched out into printing. He opened his own bookshop in 1819 on Broughton Street, a historical street absorbed by Edinburgh's New Town. He founded the publishing firm of W. & R. Chambers Publishers with his brother, Robert in 1832. He was a keen advocate of popular education and his firm pioneered the use of industrial technologies of publishing to make print available cheaply.Fyfe, Aileen (2012) Steam-Powered Knowledge: William Chambers and the Business of Publishing, 1820-1860 Chicago: University of Chicago Press With his younger brother, Robert Chambers, he produced books and periodicals of Scottish interest, such as Gazetteer of Scotland. They also made money in promulgating the many new science discoveries as the modern world emerged from prior modes of thinking in such periodicals as the Edinburgh Journal. Their publishing business prospered, and in 1859 Chambers founded a museum and art gallery in Peebles. The brothers collaborated on the publication of Chambers Encyclopaedia between 1860 and 1868. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1860, his proposer was John Shank More.https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf His address was then given as 13 Chester Street, a large townhouse in Edinburgh's west end. As Lord Provost of Edinburgh from 1865 to 1869, Chambers was responsible for the restoration of St Giles Cathedral and other major town planning exercises, including the creation of Jeffrey Street, St Marys Street and Blackfriars Street. These streets were all created under the City Improvement Act of 1866, including one named in his memory: (Chambers Street) and here in its centre stands a statue to him, by local sculptor John Rhind with low-relief copper panels on the base by William Shirreffs. Chambers is buried in Peebles Cemetery.https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf His memorial is placed on the eastern flank of the central tower.  Greyfriars Bobby  In 1867 the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, Sir William Chambers, who was also a director of the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, paid for Bobby's licence and gave the dog a collar, now in the Museum of Edinburgh.Education Scotland website (11 February 2013).Edinburgh Museums and Galleries website (11 February 2013). Memorials A memorial stained glass window was erected in the centre of the north aisle of St Giles Cathedral in his memory. A smaller window to his brother Robert stands to its side.  W. & R. Chambers  In the beginning of 1832 William Chambers started a weekly publication under the title of Chambers's Edinburgh Journal, (known since 1854 as Chambers's Journal of Literature, Science and Arts), which speedily attained a large circulation (84,000), and to which his younger brother Robert Chambers was at first only a contributor. After fourteen issues had appeared, Robert became associated with his brother as joint editor, and his collaboration may have contributed more than anything else to the success of the Journal. From September 1832 the two brothers formed the book publishing firm of W. & R. Chambers Publishers. This was originally located at 19 Waterloo Place at the east end of Princes Street.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1835 In the mid-19th century they moved to a large premises at 339 High Street on the Royal Mile.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1855 It lay between Warriston Close and Roxburgh Close.1877 Ordnance Survey Their premises was acquired in the 1930s by the City Chambers to build an extension to the chambers.Edinburgh and District: Ward Lock Travel Guide 1940 The firm would eventually become part of Chambers Harrap Publishers in the late 20th century. Among the other numerous works of which Robert was in whole or in part the author, the Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen (4 vols., Glasgow, 1832‚Äì1835), the Cyclop√¶dia of English Literature (1844), the Life and Works of Robert Burns (4 vols., 1851), Ancient Sea Margins (1848), the Domestic Annals of Scotland (1859‚Äì1861) and the Book of Days (2 vols., 1862‚Äì1864) were the most important.

He was the nephew of General Teymur X√¢n √Çyromlu and a first cousin of Queen T√¢j ol-Moluk √Çyromlu. Only some members of the Ayrums family spelled their surname \\"√Çyromlu\\" with the added suffix \\"-lu\\". Biography Born in 1882 in Baku (then part of the Russian Empire) as a member of the Turkic Ayrom tribe, Ayrom soon joined the ranks of the Persian Cossack Brigade and became an associate to Reza Khan (later Reza Shah). Ayrom climbed up the ranks swiftly, becoming a colonel of Iran's Cossack Brigade as early as 1901. Prior to the Russian Revolution, Ayrom reportedly spent some years in the Imperial Russian ranks, serving as an officer in the Tsarist army. He returned to Iran in 1921. He became Chief of Iran's National Police (ShahrbƒÅni) in 1931. At the height of his career, he was viewed as more powerful than a Cabinet member and Reza Shah's right-hand man. His abuses of his position included graft, framing innocent people and smuggling and seeing what was happening to others he pretended to be ill and left Iran permanently. During World War II, Ayrom made active efforts in order to create a government in exile in Berlin, German-backed, under the name of ƒ™rƒÅn-e ƒÅzƒÅd. The aims were to perform activity against the allied occupation of Iran, and to take over Iran as well after the German victory in the war. During the Allied occupation of Iran, when it led to the arrests of all sympathizers with Germany, Ayrom was \\"arrested and confined to a village in Germany\\".

Much of the area at Breakfast Point was occupied by the Mortlake Gas Works of the Australian Gaslight Company (AGL). AGL began developing the site from 1883. The Mortlake Gasworks site offered river access for colliers‚Äîknown as 'sixty milers'‚Äîto bring coal and virtually unlimited space for expansion. The gas works remained in operation until the 1990s when in 1998 AGL, after a selected tender process, selected Rosecorp Pty. Ltd. to progressively acquire and develop the Mortlake site.

It is located in the regions of Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes and Bourgogne-Franche-Comt√© of eastern France. The geographical term Bresse has two meanings: Bresse bourguignonne (or louhannaise), which is situated in the east of the department of Sa√¥ne-et-Loire, and Bresse, which is located in the department of Ain. The corresponding adjective is bressan, and the inhabitants are Bressans. Bresse extends from the Dombes on the south to the Doubs River on the north, and from the Sa√¥ne eastwards to the Jura mountains, measuring some in the former, and in the latter direction. It is a plain varying from feet above the sea, with few eminences and a slight inclination westwards. Heaths and coppice alternate with pastures and arable land; pools and marshes are numerous, especially in the north. Its chief rivers are the Veyle, the Reyssouze and the Seille, all tributaries of the Sa√¥ne. The soil is a gravelly clay but moderately fertile, and cattle-raising is largely carried on. The region is, however, more especially celebrated for its table poultry. History The region's name derives from the Gallo-Roman name Bricius (Brice). During the Middle Ages Bresse belonged to the lords of B√¢g√©, from whom it passed to the House of Savoy in 1272. It was not until the first half of the 15th century that the province, with Bourg as its capital, was founded as such. In 1601 it was ceded to France by the Treaty of Lyon, after which it formed (together with the province of Bugey/Bug√™) first a separate government and later part of the government of Burgundy. Initially, B√¢g√© was the principal city of the province. But its location, close to the borders of France, encouraged the emergence of Bourg-en-Bresse, which became the capital. The province was coveted by the King of France, who wanted to increase his territory. The flat nature of Bresse was difficult to defend. Finally the sovereigns of Savoy (Savou√®) agreed to relocate to the Alpine part of the Duchy and to give up Bresse and Bugey in exchange for Ch√¢teau-Dauphin in Piedmont. Agriculture and economy Bresse is noted for the 1,200,000 chickens per year which are raised primarily outdoors by 330 stockbreeders, with a minimum of 10 square metres per bird. They are sold at an average of 10 euros per kilo. The chickens of Bresse, formerly ranging freely, were the first animals to have an Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e. Bresse chickens are noted as the best quality chicken for cooking. The Bleu de Bresse cheese originates here. DemographicsTowns in Bresse= *Bourg-en-Bresse *Louhans Bressan cultureSociological outline= A chiefly rural region, Bresse was historically organized around an agricultural economy. The countryside is bocage (woodlands), resulting in independent individuals within the community, organized around the parish and the commune. Social structures, then, are defined by a mixture of conservatism, attachment to ancestral values, and direct democratic participation in community life. =Bressan folklore= The traditional festival costumes of Bresse are preserved by historical societies. They include, for the women, a wide-brim hat, in the shape of plate, topped by a black cone. For men, they comprise a blue tunic, a long bonnet, long trousers and shoes. =Conscripts= The \\"conscripts' festival\\" (la f√™te des conscrits) is a ceremony for young people, 20 years of age. It has its roots in the period of \\"conscription\\" founded by General Jourdan in 1798, who required that every man between 20 and 25 years could be called to national service. The people organized festivals before their departure. The ceremonies survive to the present, and are appreciated by the population, seeing them as a way of maintaining social bonds. These festivals generally take place between January and March. The people gather in a large banquet during which traditional \\"rigodon\\" music is played by two musicians, on clarinet and drum. The banquet is entirely organized by 20-year-old people, who make it a point of honor to personally invite each guest to visit their home. They are then given rosettes, in distinctive designs corresponding to their age. The conscripts' festivals coincide with patron saints' days. Those are the occasions of the vogue, a weekend festival. =Dialect= Bressan, a dialect of the Franco-Proven√ßal language, was the principal language of informal communication in the Bressan countryside until the 1950s. It is still spoken, though more rarely. (See the article on Franco-Proven√ßal for several examples.)

History The text, sometimes referred to simply as The Two Entrances, was first used in 6th century CE by a group of wandering monks in Northern China specializing in meditation who looked to Bodhidharma as their spiritual forebearer. Though this text was originally attributed to Bodhidharma, a great deal of material was added to it, probably around the 8th century, by the monks or perhaps other anonymous groups. The work, along with T'an Lun's biography of Bodhidharma and other newly discovered manuscripts, was recompiled by a renowned Japanese Zen practitioner, Daisetsu Teitaro Suzuki, in 1935. Teachings The two entrances referred to in the title are the entrance of principle (ÁêÜÂÖ• l«êr√π) and the entrance of practice (Ë°åÂÖ• x√≠ngr√π). * \\"Entrance of principle\\" refers to seeing through the obscurations of our daily mind and manifesting our true nature, that is, Buddha nature; it is referred to in one short passage: * \\"Entrance of practice\\" deals with practicing a \\"detached perspective on the varying circumstances of one's own life,\\" through different daily practices. In the section on the latter, the four practices are listed as being at the core of Bodhidharma's teaching. These are: ** Practice of the retribution of enmity: to accept all suffering as the fruition of past transgressions, without enmity or complaint. **Practice of the acceptance of circumstances: to remain unmoved even by good fortune, recognizing it as evanescent. **Practice of the absence of craving: to be without craving, which is the source of all suffering. **Practice of accordance with the Dharma: to eradicate wrong thoughts and practice the six perfections, without having any ‚Äúpractice‚Äù According to John R. Mcrae, \\"the ‚Äúentrance of principle‚Äù refers to interior cultivation, mental practice undertaken deep within the individual's psyche, and the ‚Äúentrance of practice‚Äù refers to practice undertaken actively and in interaction with the world.\\" Yet, McRae also notes that it's not clear what exactly the \\"entrance of principle\\" entailed. The phrase \\"wall contemplation,\\" biguan, is not explicated. Later tradition graphically depicted it as practicing dhyana while facing a wall, but it may be a metaphor, referring to the four walls of a room which prevent the winds from entering the room. Structure The format of the text is that of a collection of the master's teaching as collected by his students. There are two entrances listed, one abstract and one concrete. In other words, the text list two different ways of achieving enlightenment, one based on inward reflection (the entrance of principle) and one based on outward action (the entrance of practice). The bimodal structure of this treatise was frequently copied and became typical in early Chan Buddhism.

The center was named after the late Pauline Antoinette Schmutzer, who donated her estate to the center. Dr Willie Smits of the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation designed the orangutan enclosure so that the orangutans have as natural an environment as possible. Thick dark glass allows visitors to see the orangutans while being invisible to them. Exhibits Beginning in February 2014, the zoo will be closed every Monday for maintenance and to provide a quiet day for the animals.

Awdry. This article lists and details episodes from the third series of the show, which was first broadcast in the United States in 1991 as part of Shining Time Station, and followed a year later in the United Kingdom. This series was narrated by Michael Angelis for the UK audiences, while George Carlin narrated the episodes for the US audiences. Some episodes in this series have 1 title: the original from the American titles are shown underneath. In the US, this season was aired from 18 November 1991 to 20 August 1993 on the PBS television network.

Production  Filming = Series 3 was produced in 1991 and 1992 by The Britt Allcroft Company in association with Japanese television station Fuji Television. It was divided into 2 parts, one part having 16 episodes and the other having 10. 16 episodes aired in the United States in 1991 as part of Shining Time Station, and the last 10 episodes aired on the same program in 1992. It was made at a cost of ¬£1,300,000. Before production of series 3, Clearwater Features closed down, with The Britt Allcroft Company becoming the sole producer. Producer Robert D. Cardona left before series 3, and Britt Allcroft took his place as co-producer alongside David Mitton. = Stories = The series was a combination of episodes derived from The Railway Series, stories in the Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends magazine (written by Andrew Brenner, the show's head writer from 2013‚Äì18), and a couple of original stories by Allcroft and Mitton. One of the primary reasons for diverging from the original books was that many of the stories not yet used featured large numbers of new characters, which would be expensive to produce. Another was that the producers wanted more stories about Thomas, the nominal main character. Awdry complained that the new stories would be unrealistic (see Henry the Green Engine for more details).

He then hosted the nighttime version of the popular quiz show Tic-Tac-Dough from its debut on September 12, 1957 through September 1958, yielding that job to Win Elliot for the remaining 13 weeks of the show's nighttime run (September 1957 ‚Äì December 1958). Jackson was featured on an episode of The Honeymooners in which Ralph Kramden appears on a fictitious television quiz show called The $99,000 Answer, hosted by Jackson. The episode first aired over CBS on January 28, 1956. When the quiz show scandals exploded in 1958, among the materials a federal grand jury investigated was a series of 1957 Tic-Tac-Dough episodes hosted by Jackson and preserved on kinescope, featuring U.S. Army captain Michael O'Rourke winning over $140,000 during his reign as champion. Jackson himself was never accused of any wrongdoing; it was noted that he left the show well before the investigations began in earnest. One episode in that series of shows is available through classic video sellers. After leaving Tic- Tac-Dough Jackson never hosted another quiz or game show, though he did narrate a series of Laurel and Hardy retrospectives during the 1960s.

Monument to Hachigor≈ç, Kanda My≈çjin. is a Japanese fictional character, the hero of a series of Japanese novels, films and TV programmes set in the Edo period (1603‚Äì1868) of Japanese history. He is a policeman (Â≤°„Å£Âºï„Åç, okappiki) who catches criminals by throwing coins, the zeni of the title, thus Zenigata Heiji. The hero was created by novelist Kod≈ç Nomura (ÈáéÊùëËÉ°Â†Ç, Nomura Kod≈ç) in 1931. Heiji's beat is My≈çjin-shita, \\"beneath the (Kanda) My≈çjin shrine\\". Situation The hero, Heiji, lives with his wife Oshizu. His sidekick is Hachigor≈ç (ÂÖ´‰∫îÈÉé), also known as Karappachi or just Hachi. He uses deduction, a jutte, and old-fashioned coins with a hole, called kan'eits≈´h≈ç (ÂØõÊ∞∏ÈÄöÂÆù), as weapons to catch criminals. Novels The original series of stories ran from 1937 to 1959. The first story was published in the Japanese magazine Bungei Shunj≈´ ≈åru Yomimono-han (all story edition). In all, 383 stories were produced. Many are still in print in Japan today. Historical accuracy Zenigata Heiji is a fictional story, and is not based on any real individual. It is not made clear in which part of the Edo period the stories are set. The description of the okappiki in Zenigata Heiji differs from reality on several points. Okappiki were unpaid, or received a very small amount of money. Zenigata Heiji is depicted as a full-time policeman with no other job. In reality, this would have been impossible. Further, the \\"jutte\\" that Heiji usually carries was only issued to okappiki when the severity of an incident called for it. In the TV series, Heiji carries his jutte in his belt; however, the jutte was actually carried in a pocket. The style of the jutte is also unrealistic.

Awdry. This article lists and details episodes from the 4th series of the show, which was broadcast in 1994 and 1995. This series was narrated by Michael Angelis for the United Kingdom audiences, with George Carlin narrating the episodes for the United States audiences on which was also his last series. This was also the final season where Thomas only appeared in the United States as a segment on Shining Time Station, after that it became a program on Mister Moose's Fun Time and Storytime With Thomas. Two of the episodes in this series have two titles: the original ones from the United Kingdom broadcasts are shown on top, while the American-adapted titles are shown underneath. It was produced by Britt Allcroft (Thomas) Limited. ProductionFilming= The 4th series saw the introduction of the smaller narrow-gauge engines. For ease of filming, series 5 would introduce larger-scale versions of the characters, and from series 6-7, these larger models were used almost exclusively. The working title for Thomas and the Special Letter was The Fat Controller's Engines. it aired on Nickelodeon UK from March 19, 1999 to March 23, 2001. =Stories= Half of the 3rd series consisted of stories written by the show's staff, but only one original story, \\"Rusty to the Rescue\\" (written by Allcroft and Mitton), was written for the 4th series. The episodes which used The Railway Series did take some liberties with the source material, in order to fill the runtime and make the stories more accessible. From series 5 onward, all stories would be staff-written, without using the Awdrys' books as a source. Stepney (a character based on a real-life engine and used to highlight the Preservation Movement in the books) was given an entirely different background when he was introduced. This decision carried on into later series, in which he was seen on either a fictionalized Bluebell Railway or as a member of The Fat Controller's railway. The show had come under fire for having too few female characters, and a conscious decision was made to rewrite Rusty, who was always a male character in the books, as gender- neutral.https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/26/magazine/sunday- february-26-1995-gender-watch-sex-of-a-new-machine.html?pagewanted=1 Thomas' new owners, initially defended the decision, citing Rusty's gender neutrality since Series 4, later releases of the same episode substituted male pronouns in reference to Rusty. =Talent= Initially, each episode was broadcast in installments of the children's television program Shining Time Station. 2 stories from Series 4 were aired in each of the hour-long \\"Family Specials\\" in 1995. The rest were broadcast in a 6-episode offshoot called Mr. Conductor's Thomas Tales. Later they would air in a new half-hour program called Storytime with Thomas, which also included a Series 5 episode narrated by Alec Baldwin and an episode of Britt Allcroft's Magic Adventures of Mumfie.

It is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. HistoryAboriginal culture= Prior to European settlement, what is now Cambridge Park was home to the Mulgoa people who spoke the Darug language. They lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle governed by traditional laws, which had their origins in the Dreamtime. Their homes were bark huts called \\"gunyahs\\". They hunted kangaroos and emus for meat, and gathered yams, berries and other native plants. Shortly after the arrival of the First Fleet in Australia in 1788, an outbreak of smallpox decimated the local indigenous communities. =European settlement= The first land grant in the area was made in 1831 to Phillip Parker King, son of the Governor Phillip Gidley King. He named it St Stephens although it later became part of the Werrington estate belonging to his sister Mary Lethbridge. It was run as a farm until the 1880s when the estate was subdivided into smaller farms, one of which became Cambridge Park. Development in the area began in the 1950s. Cambridge Park Post Office opened on 2 January 1953 and closed around 1995. Housing Developed mainly in the 1950s, the streets are at right angles to each other, unlike the curving street patterns of the newer suburbs to the north, and the houses are mostly fibro on quarter acre blocks.

Geography Bordighera is located at from France and it is possible to see the French coast with a naked eye from the town. Having the \\"Capo Sant‚ÄôAmpelio\\" which protrudes into the sea, it is the southernmost commune of the region. The cape is at around the same latitude of Pisa and features a little church built in the 11th century for Sant‚ÄôAmpelio, the patron saint of the city. Since Bordighera is built where the Maritime Alps plunge into the sea it benefits from the Foehn effect which creates a special microclimate that has warmer winters. History It seems that has been inhabited since the Palaeolithic era, as archaeologists have found signs of human activities in the caves on the Italian and French coast. The first humans to alter the territory and create a structured society arrived in the 6th century B.C.. They were the Ligures, from whom the name of the region, \\"Liguria\\" in Italian, is derived. The name of the city appears for the first time as \\"Burdigheta\\" in 1296, in a papal Bill of by Pope Boniface VIII. The area was particularly prosperous during Roman times because it was situated on the via Julia Augusta in the 1st century B.C.. After the fall of the Roman Empire the village was abandoned because of the frequent attacks by pirates and it is only in 1470 that some families of nearby villages such as the Borghetto San Nicol√≤ decided to return to Bordighera. The Moorish pirates became rarer and rarer even though some particularly cruel raids still occasionally happened such as the one by the pirate Hayreddin Barbarossa in 1543. With pirate attacks diminishing the strategic importance of the area became obvious to the Dukes of Savoy and the Republic of Genoa which fought for the territory in the 16th century. The small village was quickly transformed into a fortified town and gained importance until it became independent from the rival city \\"Ventimiglia\\" in 1683. On 20 April 1686, the representants of eight villages, Camporosso, Vallebona, Vallecrosia, San Biagio della Cima, Sasso, Soldano, Borghetto San Nicol√≤ and Bordighera had a meeting at the \\"St. Bartholomew Oratory (Bordighera)\\" to build what will be called \\"Magnifica comunit√† degli otto luoghi\\" (in English \\"The magnificent community of the eight locations\\"). The goal of this meeting was to unite and gain independence from the nearby rival city of Ventimiglia. In 1797 Bordighera lost its independence completely and became part of the \\"Palms Jurisdiction\\", a region including all the land from Ventimiglia to Arma di Taggia with Sanremo as its capital. On 23 July 1813, French shore batteries fired on when the seas pushed Armada into range. Armada landed her marines who captured the eastern battery and then entered the battery on the point of Borgidhero after the French had tried to blow it up. The landing party took fire from the nearby town so the frigates accompanying Armada fired on the town. The next change of power in the region came in 1815 when the whole of Liguria was annexed to the Kingdom of Sardinia after the Congress of Vienna. The Napoleonic influence, however, remained and continued to influence the area. A good example of this is the \\"La Corniche\\" road which Napoleon Bonaparte had wanted, and which reached Bordighera, facilitating the movement of people and goods and boosting the development of what was once called \\"Borgo Marina\\" and today constitutes Bordighera. The old town is simply called Old Bordighera or Upper Bordighera due to its position over the hill (in Italian \\"Bordighera Vecchia\\" or \\"Bordighera Alta\\"). The Golden Age of the city came in the 19th century when the lower city was built next to the \\"Corniche\\" road and the sea which attracted English tourists. Touristic interest in Bordighera seems to have been sparked by a novel from Giovanni Ruffini, Il Dottor Antonio which was published in 1855 in Edinburgh and featured the town. In 1860, five years after the famous novel Il Dottor Antonio was published, Bordighera's first hotel was opened, then called in French \\"Hotel d‚ÄôAngleterre\\", now known as Villa Eugenia, at Via Vittorio Emanuele 218. The hotel hosted its first famous resident in 1861, British Prime Minister Lord John Russell, 1st Earl Russell, grandfather of Bertrand Russell. In 1873, the railway station was opened, allowing travel from Paris to Bordighera in only 24 hours, which at the time was remarkably fast. With the opening of the Calais-Rome Express railway on 8 December 1883, travel times got even shorter and 24 hours would be enough to travel from London to Bordighera. In 1887, St√©phen Li√©gard, in his famous book \\"La Cote d‚ÄôAzur\\", dedicated several pages to Bordighera and gave it a name that stuck: \\"Queen of the Palm Trees\\". He also noted that the \\"Grand Hotel de Bordighera\\" hosted Empress Eugenie in the autumn of 1886. In the 1890s, the Irish naturalist and early modernist writer Emily Lawless visited Bordighera a number of times, studying the local flora. In 1894, she wrote the essay \\"Two Leaves from a Note-Book\\" about a trip to Bordighera, describing the stunning changes in the landscape during and after a drought.Emily Lawless, \\"Two Leaves from a Note-Book\\", Alexandra College Magazine, June , 1895, pp. 242‚Äì49. In 1918 the Bordighera War Cemetery was built to commemorate fallen British soldiers who died in the area during the First World War. It was designed by Sir Robert Lorimer.Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer On 12 February 1941, the prime minister of the time, Benito Mussolini met Francisco Franco in Bordighera in order to discuss Spain's entry into World War II on the side of the Axis powers. In July 1947, Evita Peron visited Bordighera and, in order to honour her visit the seaside promenade was named Lungomare Argentina. The road is 2,300m long, which makes it the longest promenade on the Riviera. Bordighera was the first town in Europe to grow date palms, and its citizens still have the exclusive right to provide the Vatican with palm fronds for Easter celebrations.

It is near Ardingly, West Sussex in the High Weald (grid reference TQ340315), and comprises a late 16th-century mansion and a mainly 20th-century garden, and Kew's Millennium Seed Bank, in a modern building. Visitors are able to see the gardens, the Mansion, and also visit the seed bank. The garden today covers some and includes walled and water gardens, woodland and wetland conservation areas. RBG Kew has leased the land from the National Trust since 1965 and much has been achieved in this time, from the Millennium Seed Bank project and the creation of the Loder Valley and Francis Rose Nature Reserves to the introduction of the visitor centre, the Seed caf√© and Stables restaurant along with the development of the gardens. Wakehurst is listed Grade I on the National Heritage List for England, and its gardens are listed Grade II* on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. The stables are listed Grade II* and the South Lodge and gateway is listed Grade II. History The mansion was built by Sir Edward Culpeper in 1590. It originally formed a complete courtyard prior to being altered various times, and currently has an E-shaped plan. Wakehurst was bought in 1694 by Dennis Lyddell, comptroller of the Royal Navy treasurer's accounts and briefly MP for Harwich. His son Richard Liddell, Chief Secretary for Ireland and MP for Bossiney, was obliged by financial pressure to pass the estate to his younger brother Charles. The house was illustrated in Joseph Nash's The Mansions of England in the Olden Time (1839‚Äì49). The gardens were largely created by Gerald Loder (later Lord Wakehurst) who purchased the estate in 1903 and spent 33 years developing the gardens. He was succeeded by Sir Henry Price, under whose care the Loder plantings matured. Sir Henry left Wakehurst to the nation in 1963 and the Royal Botanic Gardens took up a lease from the National Trust in 1965. In 1887, American architect Dudley Newton completed a replica of Wakehurst in Newport, Rhode Island, for sportsman and politician James J. Van Alen from plans designed by Charles Eamer Kempe. Salve Regina University purchased the mansion from the Van Alen family in 1972. National Collections Wakehurst is home to the National Collections of Betula (birches), Hypericum, Nothofagus (Southern Hemisphere beeches) and Skimmia. The Great Storm of 1987 decimated Loder's plantings, toppling 20,000 trees.Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, Souvenir Guide, 4th ed. 2009:81. Since then, Kew has redesigned the gardens to create a walk through the temperate woodlands of the world. Millennium Seed Bank The Wellcome Trust Millennium Building, which houses an international seed bank known as the Millennium Seed Bank (run by Kew, not the National Trust), was opened in 2000. The aim of the Millennium Seed Bank is to collect seeds from all of the UK's native flora and conserve seeds from 25% of the world's flora by 2020, in the hope that this will save species from extinction in the wild. Nearby, also cared for by Kew, are Loder Valley Nature Reserve of woodland, meadowland and wetland habitats, and the Francis Rose Reserve, the first devoted to cryptogams (mosses, lichens and ferns). Christmas tree Wakehurst is home to the largest growing Christmas tree in England, a giant redwood. The tree stands tall and is lit with around 1,800 lights from Advent until Twelfth Night. The lightbulbs on the tree were changed in 2006 to energy-saving lightbulbs, so the tree is not as bright as before but uses less energy. Popular culture Much of Kenneth Branagh's 2006 film As You Like It, adapted from Shakespeare's play, was filmed on location at Wakehurst.

It is to the immediate south of Camden, New South Wales and shares the same postcode 2570. History The area now known as Camden South was originally home to the Muringong, southernmost of the Darug people and the Gandangara people of the Southern Highlands. In 1805, wool pioneer John Macarthur was granted 5,000 acres (20 km¬≤) at Cowpastures (now Camden). After the land was cleared, it was used for farming for most of the next 200 years until Sydney's suburban sprawl reached the town of Camden and modern suburbs like Camden South were subdivided into housing blocks.  Heritage listings  Camden South has a number of heritage- listed sites, including: * Elizabeth Macarthur Avenue: Camden Park Estate and Belgenny Farm PeopleDemographics= According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 4,539 people in Camden South. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 2.3% of the population. * 85.3% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 5.1%. * 94.2% of people only spoke English at home. * The most common responses for religion Catholic 29.6%, Anglican 28.2% and No Religion 21.8%.

Tlachtga's name was attached to the Hill of Ward, which was the site of prominent festivals in her honour in the Middle Ages. History According to Irish tradition, Tlachtga was the red-haired daughter of the arch-druid Mug Ruith. She accompanied him on his world travels, learning his magical secrets and discovering sacred stones in Italy. She was raped by the three sons of sorcerer Simon Magus, her father's mentor, and returned to Ireland where she gave birth to triplets called Cumma, Doirb and Muach issued from three different fathers. They were born on the hill that would bear the name of their mother. The triple birth is a common theme in Celtic mythology, and her death from grief and the construction of a fortress at her grave echoes the story of Macha. Sacred hill The Hill of Tlachtga is associated with the Hill of Ward in County Meath, and its celebrations rivaled those at Tailtiu. The major ceremony held at Tlachtga was the lighting of the winter fires at Samhain (November 1). The ringfort built on the hill was associated not only with the kings of Mide, but also with Munster as well. The site was known in the popular culture of medieval Ireland as a place where Mug Ruith's flying machine roth r√°mach had been seen, and where the ard r√≠ Ruaidr√≠ Ua Conchobair had held a massive assemblage in 1168.

It began brownfields remediation in late 2015, and is ear- marked as a major centre for high density living.http://www.planning.nsw.gov.au/camellia Camellia is located west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the City of Parramatta. The suburb is bounded by the Parramatta River to the north, Clay Cliff Creek to the west, Duck River to the east, and Grand Avenue. Major roads dissecting the suburb are Grand Avenue (east-west) and James Ruse Drive (north-south). Camellia shares the postcode of 2142 with the separate suburbs of Granville, South Granville, Holroyd and Rosehill. History The first inhabitants and visitors = The Burramattagal clan were the indigenous people who originally inhabited this area, relying on the fish, shellfish, bird life reptiles and marsupials that were once abundant in the waterways and forests adjoining the Parramatta River and the freshwaters of Clay Cliff Creek. On 22 April 1788 Governor Arthur Phillip and his party of officers and marines journeyed inland by boat from Sydney Cove to find better farmlands for the new settlement. They landed at the head of a navigable river near what is now Clyde, which he called Duck River due to the abundance of ducks in the area. They left their boats to explore the area but could not penetrate the thick bush. The party moved to the banks of Clay Cliff Creek, where they decided to camp because of its fresh water. Romanticised painting of Elizabeth Farm viewed from the northern riverbank of Parramatta River by Joseph Lycett. The freshwater stream depicted in the middle as a tributary is Clay Cliff Creek. In his Journal, surgeon John White recorded: Clay Cliff Creek was the common boundary of the land grants to wool pioneer John Macarthur, who by the early 1800s extended his land grants and his Elizabeth Farm holdings to gain the complete river frontage between the township of Parramatta and Duck River. The railway station that opened here in 1885 was originally called Subiaco, but it caused confusion because this was the name of the Benedictine school on the opposite side of Parramatta River. In 1901, the station name was changed to Camellia, after the Camellia Grove Nursery nearby that specialised in growing Camellias. This land was leased by Silas Sheather since 1852 on what was originally part of the of Elizabeth Farm.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollen, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia  Heritage listings  Camellia has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Grand Avenue: Sewage Pumping Station 67 Commercial area Camellia is predominantly an industrial and commercial area. An office block close to the railway station contains an Aldi supermarket. This is the former site of the James Hardie asbestos plant where Bernie Banton worked. Transport Camellia railway station on the Carlingford Line was formerly part of the Sydney Trains network. The Sandown railway line served the industry in Camellia. Passenger service ceased in 1991. A conversion of the Carlingford to Camellia section of the Carlingford railway line as well as part of the Sandown line to light rail was announced in 2015 as part of the Parramatta Light Rail project. A second line, from Sydney Olympic Park, will join with the Carlingford line at either Camellia or Rydalmere before both lines proceed to Westmead. Grand Avenue is the main road in Camellia.

A continuous flow intersection (CFI), also called a crossover displaced left-turn (XDL or DLT), is an alternative design for an at-grade road junction. Vehicles attempting to turn across the opposing direction of traffic (left in right-hand drive jurisdictions; right in left-hand drive jurisdictions) cross before they enter the intersection. No left turn signal in the intersection is then necessary. Instead, vehicles traveling in both directions can proceed, including through vehicles and those turning right or left, when a generic traffic signal/stop sign permits. Its design also is promoted as part of the Federal Highway Administration's Every Day Counts initiative which started in 2011.

Operational details  Part of the delay at a typical high-volume right- hand drive intersection is to accommodate left-turns; through-traffic must wait for the traffic turning left because it crosses the path of the through traffic. The continuous flow intersection moves the left-turn conflict out of the intersection and synchronizes it with the signal cycle of the intersecting road. In the adjacent diagram, while the left/right traffic flows through the main intersection, the left-turn traffic crosses to the opposite side of the oncoming traffic a few hundred feet away. Doing this removes the crossing conflict. When the north/south through traffic is allowed through the main intersection, the north/south left-turn lanes are also allowed through the intersections as their paths are no longer crossing. All traffic flow is controlled by traffic signals as at a regular intersection. The Louisiana DOTD article on the Baton Rouge CFI includes a particularly informative diagram of that intersection. To reduce confusion regarding the left-turn lane, the left- turn lane and the straight-through lanes are usually separated by a concrete barrier or traffic island. This diagram shows the straight-through lanes offset by one lane through the intersection and are guided by lines painted through the intersection. But this is just a sample configuration; the lanes may be offset by more lanes or none at all. Nonetheless, due to the provision of traffic between two directions of opposing traffic, some motorists tend to maintain an ongoing criticism of the intersection. Additionally, as in the case of the half-CFI in Accokeek, the offset left-turn traffic reenters the main traffic stream via a half-signal, requiring motorists to merge from a stop condition onto the higher-speed mainline. Motorists sometimes cite discomfort due to the speed differential, a known cause of accidents, though conflicts could be reduced through the provision of an adequate acceleration lane and merge area. The Accokeek, MD CFI also has notable inequalities in traffic flow depending upon the direction of travel. This type of intersection can require a significant amount of right-of-way to implement (dependent upon the configuration), which is why the technique is not frequently used in urban areas. However, the amount of right-of-way necessary for construction and final operation is still typically less than that of an interchange. Additionally, as there is no grade separation involved, costs are considerably less than that of an interchange alternative.  Case studies  The redesign of the Redwood Road/6200 South intersection in Taylorsville, Utah cut emissions of carbon dioxide by 19 tons (17 tonnes) per year.FHWA: DLT Case Study ‚Äì Redwood Road at 6200 South in Taylorsville (Utah), published July 31, 2014 Compared to the previous design, the redesign of the Bangerter Highway/3500 South intersection saves minutes of travel time per vehicle and of fuel per year, and has 60% fewer accidents nearby; it also cost $20 million to $40 million less in construction costs than a grade-separated alternative.FHWA: DLT Case Study ‚Äì Bangerter Highway in Salt Lake County (Utah), published July 31, 2014  Parallel-flow intersection  A parallel- flow intersection (PFI) is a variant similar to the CFI, patented in 2006. It arranges the left-turning traffic in a different manner; it is not displaced, instead turning left closer to the intersection onto a parallel roadway, to the left of oncoming traffic.Federal Highway Administration: Alternative Intersections/Interchanges: Informational Report (AIIR), Publication Number: FHWA-HRT-09-060, April 2010 This was first used in New Jersey at the junction of New Jersey Route 168 and US Highway 130, between Haddon Township and Camden ().

He began his path toward Islamist thought by joining the Muslim Brotherhood in the 1960s. After being arrested for activities related to the group he became interested in the works of Sayyid Qutb and other radical thinkers. After being released in 1971, he gathered followers and withdrew from contemporary society. He was executed on March 19, 1978, after kidnapping and killing an Egyptian government minister and mainstream Muslim cleric, Muhammad al-Dhahabi. He was sentenced to death after a swiftly arranged military tribunal, alongside four other leaders. Early life Shukri was born on 1 June 1942 in Abu Khurus in Middle Egypt but moved with his mother at a young age to nearby Asyut. He attended an Islamic school and went on to study agriculture at Assiut University.Giles Kepel, Muslim extremism in Egypt: the Prophet and the Pharaoh, p. 74 It was here that he first came into contact with the Muslim Brotherhood, and he was arrested for distributing their pamphlets in 1965. Shukri spent six years in prison, initially in Tura and then, from 1967, in Abu Zabal. While imprisoned, he read the recently executed Qutb's declarations that Egypt was in jahiliyyah (a state of pre-Islamic ignorance). Shukri and some of his fellow prisoners built on these ideas; they believed that most Egyptians were no longer truly Muslims, but had become apostates by their failure to struggle against the state.Marc Sageman, Understanding terror networks, p. 14 Shukri's faction, known as Jama'at al- Muslimin (Society of Muslims), additionally believed that Qutb had also called for total separation from jahiliyyah society.The Prophet and the Pharaoh, p75 Jama'at al-Muslimin fell apart following the Muslim Brotherhood's official rejection of Qutb's theories. The group's first leader, Sheikh Ali Abduh Ismail, renounced Takfir in 1969. Shukri was soon the leader by default: he was the only remaining member.The Prophet and the Pharaoh, p. 76 He was released from prison in 1971 as part of the new president Anwar Sadat's rapprochement with the Muslim Brotherhood. Leadership of Jama'at al-Muslimin group On his release, Shukri returned to Asyut where he finished his studies and began recruiting followers in the surrounding villages. In 1973, following the arrest of some of his followers, he took the group to live in caves in the nearby mountains, fully implementing his belief in withdrawal.The Prophet and the Pharaoh, pp. 76-77 He felt that his group was currently too weak to take action and so adopted a policy of separation. He hoped that this would protect the community from outside influences and allow it to grow in strength. By 1976 Shukri's followers numbered two thousand, mostly living in poor neighbourhoods of Cairo. They were known to the authorities but not considered a serious threat.The Prophet and the Pharaoh, p. 77 The members were forced to cut off contact with their families, bringing about several lawsuits from family members of women who joined. They felt Shukri was in essence seducing their daughters, or in some cases wives, and thus negating Egyptian views of family.Sageman, p15 Beliefs Shukri took an extreme position. He regarded all previous scholarship as unnecessary and rejected even the four madh'habs (schools) of Islam. He insisted that each Muslim must engage in ijtihad (interpretation) based on the Qu'ran and the sunnah (practices of Muhammad and his followers).The Prophet and the Pharaoh, pp. 79-80 and Calvert, p282 Shukri rejected everything that he considered tainted by jahiliyyah society, including mosques‚Äîhe instructed his followers not to attend Friday prayer in them. He claimed that, while some unaffiliated mosques were acceptable, the most appropriate place to pray was at home.The Prophet and the Pharaoh, pp. 81-83 He was indifferent to Egypt's \\"Anti-Zionist\\" struggle. When asked what he would do if Israel invaded Egypt, he responded that his group would flee rather than fight back. He considered the Egyptian Army his enemy just as much as Israel.The Prophet and the Pharaoh, pp. 83-84 He also believed that learning to write was useless for most Egyptians, and opposed it.The Prophet and the Pharaoh, pp. 84-85 Unlike most similar groups, Jama'at al-Muslimin encouraged women to join. Shukri personally arranged marriages with male members and the group provided accommodation in shared lodgings. Often several couples would share a room, separated only by hanging curtains. If a married woman joined the group and her husband did not, then Shukri considered the \\"jahilliyah\\" marriage valueless and allowed her to wed again. This approach to marriage brought the group to public attention, with several media stories of family members claiming that their daughters had been stolen from them.The Prophet and the Pharaoh, pp. 86-89 According to authors Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon, based on the \\"testimony of those who knew him\\", and what Shuqri \\"intimated\\" during his trial, \\"it is clear Shuqri Mustafa thought he was the Mahdi\\", (the prophesied messiah of Islam who will return to Earth before the Day of Judgment and, (alongside Jesus), rid the world of wrongdoing, injustice and tyranny).The Age of Sacred Terror by Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon, pp. 90-1 According to Abdullah el-Faisal, Shukri Mustafa made takfir on those who drank water from the taps because they were controlled by the government and was one of the Khawarij. =Confronting the state= In 1976 a few members left for other groups. Shukri reacted angrily. He declared them apostate and, in November, led two raids to kill them. The police intervened, detaining fourteen of his followers and issuing a warrant for Shukri's own arrest.Marc Sageman, Understanding terror networks, p. 28.The Prophet and the Pharaoh, pp. 94-95. Surprised by the official response, Shukri demanded their release but he was ignored by the Egyptian government and ridiculed by the press. It was at this point that his group was given the label \\"Takfir wal-Hijra\\" (Excommunication and Exile). Shukri hated the term, but it was far more descriptive than the group's chosen name and became fixed in the popular consciousness. Death Shukri was frustrated by his inability to use his new media profile to promote his views and his leadership within the group was under question. His response was to kidnap a former Egyptian government minister and mainstream Muslim cleric, Muhammad al-Dhahabi, on July 3, 1977. Al-Dhahabi had previously produced an official pamphlet against the group, in which he linked them to Kharijism. Shukri demanded the release of his followers, apologies from the press and the printing of his literature. When these were ignored, the hostage was killed.Marc Sageman, Understanding terror networks, p. 29.The Prophet and the Pharaoh, pp. 96-99 The government's response was swift and decisive. Hundreds were arrested and dozens imprisoned. After a swiftly arranged military tribunal, Shukri and four other leaders were executed on March 19, 1978.The Prophet and the Pharaoh, pp. 78, 97 ReferencesSources *Kepel, Giles.

During the 1984 constitutional crisis, Beattie was nearly forced to dismiss the sitting prime minister, Robert Muldoon. Early life and family Born in Sydney, Australia, on 29 February 1924, Beattie was the son of Una Mary and Joseph Nesbitt Beattie. He was brought up by his mother in Takapuna, New Zealand, and educated at Dilworth School in Auckland. In 1941, at age 17, Beattie joined the army during the Second World War, and rose to the rank of sergeant before transferring to the Royal New Zealand Naval Volunteer Reserve as a sub-lieutenant. He played rugby union for New Zealand services teams in 1944 and 1945. In 1950, Beattie married Norma Margaret Sarah Macdonald, and the couple went on to have seven children. Legal career After the war, Beattie studied law at Auckland University College, and graduated with a Bachelor of Laws in 1949, before setting up in private practice as a barrister and solicitor. He was made a Queen's Counsel in 1964, and served as president of the Auckland District Law Society in 1965. In 1969, Beattie was appointed as a Supreme Court\\"Appointment of Members of Rules Committee\\" (17 April 1969) 23 New Zealand Gazette 735. judge (the old name for the High Court, not to be confused with the new final court of appeal, the Supreme Court of New Zealand), serving on the bench until 1980.\\"Resignation of Judges of the High Court\\" (16 October 1980) 122 New Zealand Gazette 3063. Beattie chaired the 1977‚Äì78 Royal Commission on the Courts. In 1977, he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal. Governor-general On 1 August 1980 Beattie was appointed as a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George and was granted the right to retain the title of The Honourable for life.\\"Honours and Awards\\" (31 July 1980) 90 New Zealand Gazette 2323. One of the roles of governor-general is to act as Grand Prior of New Zealand, and Beattie was appointed as a Knight of the Order of St John of Jerusalem just prior to assuming the office of Governor-General of New Zealand. He was appointed as governor-general by Queen Elizabeth II on the advice of her New Zealand Prime Minister Robert Muldoon, his term of office beginning on 6 November 1980\\"Commission Appointing the Honourable Sir David Stuart Beattie, G.C.M.G., Q.C., to be Governor- General and Commander-in-Chief of New Zealand\\" (6 November 1980) 130 New Zealand Gazette 3254.\\"Assumption of the Office of Governor-General and Commander-in- Chief of New Zealand by the Honourable Sir David Smart Beattie, G.C.M.G., Q.C.\\" (6 November 1980) 130 New Zealand Gazette 3253. and continuing until 10 November 1985.\\"Revocation of the Commission Appointing the Honourable Sir David Stuart Beattie, G.C.M.C, G.C.V.O., Q.S.O., Q.C, to be Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief of New Zealand\\" (8 November 1985) 207 New Zealand Gazette 4895 On leaving office, both Sir David and Lady Beattie were appointed as Companions of the Queen's Service Order: Sir David was recognised for his public services and Lady Beattie for community service.\\"Honours and Awards\\" (7 November 1985) 206 New Zealand Gazette 4893 In 1983, Beattie was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws by the University of Auckland. =Controversies= At the height of the Springbok tour of 1981, Beattie met a delegation from Halt All Racist Tours. Beattie promised to discuss their issues with the Prime Minister Rob Muldoon. Beattie was ridiculed by supporters of the tour, and as a result, the prime minister refused to speak to the governor-general about his meeting with HART. Beattie again caused controversy when he met with protesters trying to petition the Queen at the 1983 Waitangi Day celebrations, after the prime minister had blocked all petitions. As a result, Muldoon declared that Beattie's term would not be extended beyond the traditional five-year tenure. Beattie's final controversial move was to import two Mercedes-Benz cars at the end of his term in 1985. At the time the governor- general was exempt from paying taxes and thus exempt from paying import tariffs on cars as well. The tax benefit to Beattie was $85,000.00. =Constitutional crisis= Following the 1984 general election, a political crisis arose. Muldoon declined to follow the instructions of the incoming prime minister, David Lange, as he was constitutionally required to do.Cabinet Office Cabinet Manual 2008 at [6.12] At the time, many felt that Muldoon should accede to Lange's demands. It has been stated that Beattie suggested to senior members of the National Party that he could dismiss Muldoon and appoint his deputy, Jim McLay, as prime minister before swearing in David Lange as prime minister (McLay was to replace Muldoon as leader later that year). However, such action proved unnecessary as Muldoon's cabinet threatened to remove him as leader themselves if he did not accept Lange's instructions. The crisis led to an inquiry that recommended passing the Constitution Act 1986. Later life After leaving office as governor-general, Beattie continued his involvement in public life, carrying out a number of government enquiries, and serving on company boards and sporting organisations. He prepared the Report on Science and Technology in 1986‚Äì87, the Report on the Police Complaints Authority in 1988 and was commissioner on the Fijian Courts in 1993. His company directorships included the National Bank of New Zealand, Independent Newspapers Ltd and MFL Mutual Funds Ltd. He was heavily involved in sports administration, serving as New Zealand Olympic Committee president for 11 years. He was president of the Olympic and Commonwealth Games Association in 1989 and was president of the Sports Foundation twice. His work was recognised with the award of the Olympic Order. He was also patron of the New Zealand Rugby Union, the New Zealand Boxing Association, the New Zealand Squash Rackets Association, and the Legion of Frontiersmen (NZ) Command. He was a keen golfer, tennis player and fisherman. In 1990, Beattie was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. Beattie died in Upper Hutt on 4 February 2001.

At Athens the Apaturia took place on the 11th, 12th and 13th days of the month Pyanepsion (mid-October to mid-November), on which occasion the various phratries, or clans, of Attica met to discuss their affairs. The name is a slightly modified form of or ,Ultimately from Proto- Indo-European *sm-ph2tor-u- \\"of the same father\\" (see R. S. P. Beekes, Etymological Dictionary of Greek, Brill, 2009, p. 114). the festival of \\"common relationship\\". The ancient folk etymology associated it with (\\"deceit\\"),A word now held to be of Pre-Greek origin (see Beekes, Etymological Dictionary of Greek, Brill, 2009, p. 113). a legend claiming that the festival originated in 1100 BC as a commemoration of a single combat between a certain Melanthus, representing King Thymoetes of Attica, and King Xanthus of Boeotia, in which Melanthus successfully threw his adversary off his guard by crying that a man in a black goat skin (identified with Dionysus) was helping him.Scholiast on Aristophanes, Acharnians, 146. On the first day of the festival, called Dorpia or Dorpeia (ŒîŒøœÅœÄŒµŒØŒ±), banquets were held towards evening at the meeting-place of the phratries or in the private houses of members. On the second, Anarrhysis (from , \\"to draw back the victim's head\\"), a sacrifice of oxen was offered at the public cost to Zeus Phratrius and Athena. On the third day, Kure≈çtis (), children born since the last festival were presented by their fathers or guardians to the assembled phratores, and, after an oath had been taken as to their legitimacy and the sacrifice of a goat or a sheep, their names were inscribed in the register. The name is derived either from , \\"young man\\", i.e., the day of the young, or less probably from Œ∫ŒµŒØœÅœâ, \\"to shear\\", because on this occasion young people cut their hair and offered it to the gods.

Canley Vale is located 30 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Fairfield and is part of the South-western Sydney region. History Aboriginal people from the Cabrogal tribe, a sub-group of the Gandangara tribe, have lived in the Fairfield area for over 30 000 years. Canley Vale was once a woodland area and was originally part of the Male Orphan School Estate. In the 1800s, Sir Henry Parkes (1815‚Äì96) settled in the district in a mansion which he built near the railway line between Fairfield and Cabramatta. He named it Canley Grange after his birthplace in Warwickshire, England. He named the railway station Canley Moat House and had his own private landing beside the line. \\"Vale\\" means valley or dale. Cabramatta and Canley Vale were regarded as a single community and from the 1920s it was known as Cabravale. In 1899, the municipality of Cabramatta and Canley Vale, which had been established in 1892, was redivided, and the two separate wards were gazetted on 8 January 1900. In 1948, they became part of the Fairfield local government area.

History Canley Heights takes its name from its sister-suburb down the hill, Canley Vale. When Sir Henry Parkes settled there in the mid-19th century, he named his home Canley Grange, after his birthplace Canley Moat House in Stoneleigh, Warwickshire, England. In 1959, missionaries Carl and Lova Swart from the Church of God Reformation Movement in the United States established the first congregation of the denomination in Australia on St Johns Road in Canley Heights. The church closed shortly before the turn of the 20th century, and the building is now owned and used by another Christian church. Commercial area Canley Heights mostly consists of low-density residential and commercial developments. Its commercial area is centred on Canley Vale Road, the main street in the suburb, which features convenient stores, dollar stores, and as well as a variety of ethnic restaurants (generally Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai), which usually open up until late in the weekends and would offer a 'nightlife' for the residents and visitors alike ‚Äì As most restaurants and shops close by 5pm in Sydney and the rest of the country. There are also pubs, hotels (with a VIP lounge and bar), bistros, a Westpac, hookah lounges and Commonwealth Bank in the main street. Education Canley Heights Public School was established in 1955.

She was the first woman to hold either office. Early life Catherine Anne Maclean was born in Auckland on 4 April 1933 to Scottish immigrants, Neil and Helen Maclean, and grew up in Waharoa, near Matamata, Waikato. Neil was a factory worker at the local Waharoa dairy factory. She attended Matamata College, and she gained a University Bursary in her final year, 1948. In 1949 Catherine enrolled at Auckland University College in Zoology. Family While at university, Catherine met Bob Tizard, then president of the Auckland University Students Association. On their second date, Bob told Catherine he was \\"going into politics. And I'm going to marry you.\\" They married in 1951, and Bob unsuccessfully ran for the seat of Remuera later that year at the general election and again at the 1954 general election. He was finally successful at the 1957 election, winning in Tamaki, but was defeated three years later by Rob Muldoon. The couple moved to Avondale and started a family, with Catherine having four children in six years starting at the age of 21 with Anne, followed by Linda, Judith and Nigel. They moved in 1957 to Glendowie, in the Tamaki electorate. Bob ran for and won the Pakuranga seat at the general election in 1963.  Academe  In 1961 Catherine returned to university to complete her degree in zoology. She then taught and worked at Auckland University from 1962 to 1983, during which time she co-authored at least two papers with Patricia Bergquist on sponges, and provided technical assistance as preparator for a third. Auckland City Council Tizard was elected to the Auckland City Council in 1971 and was re-elected in 1974, 1977 and 1980. She was also elected to the Auckland Regional Authority in 1980, at the same time as running for Mayor of Auckland against incumbent Sir Dove-Myer Robinson and councillor Colin Kay. This three-way split gave the election to Kay by a margin of 2,000 votes. She opposed the 1981 Springbok tour, and an attempt to ban Hare Krishna from performing chants on Queen Street. In the short-lived government of Prime Minister Norman Kirk, Bob Tizard was appointed first Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Health and later under Prime Minister Bill Rowling, Minister of Finance and Minister of Defence. This put considerable strain on the family as Bob was often away overseas. Tizard and her family moved to Wellington, and she commuted to Auckland for council business. From 1976 to 1985, Tizard starred on the popular TVNZ chat show Beauty and the Beast, along with Selwyn Toogood and Shona McFarlane. She later attributed her success in politics to this show. Mayor of Auckland City Tizard decided to run for Mayor of Auckland City again at the 1983 local elections. She defeated incumbent Colin Kay. She was the first female to serve as Mayor of Auckland. In 1984 there was a major riot in Queen Street. In the 1985 New Year Honours, she was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for public and community service. During Tizard's term as mayor, the Aotea Centre next to Aotea Square was developed. She was also the patron of the 99th Police recruit wing in 1985 in which all 75 recruits after graduation were sent to Auckland to serve. She was re-elected in 1986, and once again in 1989 following a major amalgamation of local authorities. In 1990 Auckland hosted the Commonwealth Games, an event Tizard had worked to secure for Auckland. Governor-General Tizard delivering a speech at an official function, 1992 In 1989, Tizard was appointed by Elizabeth II, Queen of New Zealand, as the nation's first female governor-general on the advice of Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer. She took office on 13 December 1990, causing a by-election for the Mayoralty of Auckland. She accepted on the proviso that the Queen be informed before her Royal tour in February 1990, and that the leader of the opposition be informed. Then Deputy Prime Minister Helen Clark and Labour Party President Margaret Wilson pushed for a female governor- general, as the 100th anniversary of Women's suffrage in New Zealand would occur during the governor-general's term in 1993. Tizard had been informed of her impending appointment by her former husband Bob Tizard, who was a member of Cabinet at the time. She later commented that this was the only time Bob breached cabinet confidentiality. Tizard was the third female governor-general in the Commonwealth (after Dame Minita Gordon of Belize in 1981, and Jeanne Sauv√© in Canada in 1984). In 1993, on the 100th anniversary of women's suffrage, Tizard received the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal. During her tenure in office, Tizard ended the practice of bowing to the governor- general, declaring, \\"No New Zealander should have to bow to another\\". She also ended the practice of members of staff ceasing to clean whenever she entered the room. While governor-general, a particular piece of legislation did not appeal to Tizard at all. She asked the question of her responsible official and asked the question of herself and finally said (apparently): \\"All right, I will sign my assent, but I will do it in black ink!\\" A special bottle was obtained and used for the purpose!\\" =Controversies= Prior to the second referendum on electoral reform in New Zealand in June 1993, Tizard caused some outrage by making an unscripted suggestion in a lecture on the role of the governor-general that under mixed-member proportional representation the governor-general would have to use their reserve powers more often, which would create instability. The 1993 New Zealand general election ‚Äì the last under First Past the Post ‚Äì nearly resulted in a hung parliament, with the election night result having the two major parties tied. She asked Sir David Beattie to form a committee, along with three retired appeal court judges, to decide whom to appoint as prime minister. However, National won one more seat and was returned to power when Labour's Sir Peter Tapsell agreed to become Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives. In an interview with North & South in 1996, Tizard stated that she could not believe \\"...some of the idiocies of the health system\\", causing great consternation from the Minister of Health. Retirement On her retirement from office, Sir Geoffrey Palmer, who had nominated Tizard for the office, stated: \\"She has been a powerful, yes a presidential public presence. She has been a part of New Zealand's growing up.\\" In the 2002 Queen's Birthday and Golden Jubilee Honours, Tizard was appointed as an Additional Member of the Order of New Zealand. In 2004, Tizard stated that she supported a New Zealand republic \\"in principle\\" and when she was governor-general, had discussed the issue of republicanism with the Queen: \\"She is quite sanguine about these things. She has always said it is a decision for New Zealand to make, and 'whatever decision New Zealand makes, of course we would accept it'.\\" In December 2004, Tizard became a member of the NZ Flag.com Trust, supporting a referendum on whether the New Zealand flag should be changed. She said, \\"Our present flag served a young post-colonial country well, but the time has come to consider a change which more appropriately recognises our changed identity and confidence in ourselves. Let's find out what the country thinks of the idea of a change.\\" In 2007, Tizard supported former Mayor of Auckland, Dick Hubbard's campaign for re-election as mayor at the local body elections. On 9 October 2007 Tizard was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 3rd Auckland (Countess of Ranfurly's Own) and Northland Regiment, a largely ceremonial role. Changes to the rules in 2006 granted Tizard the use of the style The Honourable for life, as a consequence of having been governor-general. In 2010 Tizard published her memoirs, entitled Cat Amongst the Pigeons, a reference to her personal arms. In December 2012, Tizard starred in an online video campaign supporting gay marriage, alongside New Zealand singers Anika Moa, Boh Runga and Hollie Smith, as well as Olympian Danyon Loader.

Sir Roger also possessed in his own right the manors of Bletchington and Holton, Oxfordshire, Standon in Hertfordshire, Caythorpe in Lincolnshire, and Knaresborough and St. Briavels' Castles. He fought at the Battle of Bannockburn where he provided \\"good services\\", following which he was granted the manors of Sandal, Yorkshire and Vauxhall, Surrey, in 1317. He was summoned to parliament on 20 November 1317, and in the 11th (1318), 12th (1319), 13th (1320) and 14th (1321) years of the reign of King Edward II, whereby he is held to have become Lord d'Amory. He had been a favourite of King Edward II of England until he was displaced by Hugh the younger Despenser. D'Amory took an active part in the Despenser War in 1321-1322 and was one of the principals in this affair. He captured Gloucester, burnt Bridgnorth, was at the siege of Tickhill and the battle at Burton-on-Trent. As a result, his lands were confiscated and orders were issued for his arrest. Retreating before the King's forces, being either sick or wounded he was left behind at Tutbury Castle, Staffordshire, where he was captured on 11 March 1322 (1321/1322). He was quickly tried and condemned to death. It appears, however, that his illness beat the executioner as he died there \\"of illness\\" two days later, and was buried at St. Mary's, Ware, Hertfordshire.

They are solitary, living buried in soft sediments. Tube anemones live inside and can withdraw into tubes, which are composed of a fibrous material made from secreted mucus and threads of nematocyst-like organelles known as ptychocysts. Within the tubes of these ceriantharians, more than one polyp is present, which is an exceptional trait because species that create tube systems usually contain only one polyp per tube. Ceriantharians were formerly classified in the taxon Ceriantipatharia along with the black corals but have since been moved to their own class, Ceriantharia. Ceriantharians have a crown of tentacles that are composed of two whorls of distinctly different sized tentacles. The outer whorl consists of large tentacles that extend outwards. These tentacles taper to points and are mostly used in food capture and defence. The smaller inner tentacles are held more erect than the larger lateral tentacles and are used for food manipulation and ingestion.Brusca, R.C. & Brusca, G.J. 2002.

It was the successor to the T-34, offering improved ride and cross-country performance and much greater armor. Designed to be equipped with an 85 mm main gun, by the time it was fully tested the T-34 had also moved to this weapon. Both tanks offered similar performance, so introducing the T-44 was not considered as important as increasing T-34 production. Fewer than 2,000 T-44s were built, compared to about 58,000 T-34s. Although the T-44 was available by the end of the war, it was not used in combat. However if it were used in combat it would have been a significant upgrade to the T-34. Its armor could take a hit from the German 88mm gun found on the Tiger I and Tiger II from the hull front. Attempts were made to improve the T-44's armament with a new 122 mm gun, but the turret proved to be very cramped and the rate of fire was poor, on the order of three rounds per minute. Another attempt with a 100 mm gun seemed more promising although a number of additional changes were needed to make a truly effective design. Design work on a slightly enlarged version of the T-44 began during the war and a prototype was produced in 1945. This newer design entered production in 1947 as the T-54/55 series of medium tanks, the most-produced tank series of all time. Development historyGenesis= By the end of 1940, when production of the T-34 started,\\"KMDB T-34\\" \\"Czo≈Çgi ≈öwiata\\" (World's Tanks or Tanks Of The World) magazine issue 25 there were already plans to improve the vehicle's reliability and operational capabilities by adopting more modern technology.\\"KMDB T-34M\\" This design project was designated T-34M. It had enhanced armour protection, a three-man hexagonal turret, torsion bar suspension instead of Christie suspension, road wheels with internal shock absorption, increased fuel capacity, and more main gun ammunition (100 rounds instead of 77 in standard T-34).\\"Centrum Symulacji Taktyczno-Opearcyjnych\\" The bow machine gun and driver's hatch switched positions on the glacis plate. In addition to six smaller wheels, the suspension of the T-34M had four return rollers. The original model V-2 12-cylinder diesel engine developing 500 hp (373 kW) was replaced by a new 12-cylinder diesel engine which produced .\\"armor.kiev.ua\\" It had a new 8-speed transmission system. It was the first tank design to feature transverse engine placement, which made it smaller than a standard T-34 and gave the crew more space. The Zhdanov Metallurgical Factory manufactured five sets of armour plates for the hull of the T-34M and delivered them to Factory No. 183. However, early in 1941 work on the T-34M ceased as the production facilities were extremely busy with the mass production of the T-34. When the war with Nazi Germany broke out the only sensible solution was to gradually improve the existing design. T-34-85 During the battles on the Eastern Front it became apparent that the Red Army needed a new medium tank. They requested that it should have better protection at a minimal increase of weight. In 1942 the T-43 tank design project began. It featured a new turret and shorter suspension which reduced the clearance between the roadwheels. However, it concentrated on increasing armour at a time when maintaining production and increasing firepower were more important. The T-43 was cancelled, but its new turret design was adapted to carry a larger 85 mm D-5T and later ZiS-S-53 gun in a new variant called the T-34-85. It marked the end of T-34 improvements as fitting 100 mm guns in T-34-100 prototypes proved unfeasible. (See T-34 variants article for details).\\"The Russian Battlefield\\" =Prototypes=First generation In the autumn of 1943 the design bureau of the Stalin Ural Tank Factory No. 183, located in Nizhny Tagil (in the Ural Mountains, where most of the Soviet tank industry had been evacuated after Operation Barbarossa in 1941), started working on a vehicle that would have improvement opportunities in the future, under a direct order from Joseph Stalin.\\"Czo≈Çgiem\\" The intention was to retain the high mobility of the T-34 and provide it with heavier armour protection against modern tank guns. In November 1943, the chief designer, A. A. Morozov, presented the overall design of the vehicle and a model of the tank, which received the designation T-44 (Ob'yekt 136). The first prototype was completed by January 1944 and two more were completed in February. The first two prototypes were armed with 85 mm D-5T guns and received the designation T-44-85, while the third prototype was armed with the 122 mm D-25-44T tank gun and received the designation T-44-122. The D-25-44T tank gun was very similar to the basic D-25 field gun, but differed in some minor details including fixed single-piece ammunition to increase the rate of fire and a double-baffle muzzle brake.\\"JED The Military Equipment Directory\\" What allowed fitting such powerful armament in a medium tank weighing 30 tonnes was the construction of the hull with an innovative placement of the engine. Unlike most tanks, in the T-44 the engine was placed perpendicular to the axis of the tank. The hull was designed without sponsons. It was also much wider which made the crew compartment bigger and allowed the turret to be placed over the center part of the vehicle. This reduced the overall length of the vehicle. The thickness of the armour was 75 mm on the front of the hull and 90 mm on the front of the turret. The side armour was 45 mm thick and could be reinforced by 30 mm thick additional armour plate. All three prototypes were powered by the V-2IS diesel engine which developed 500 hp (373 kW). This first generation of prototypes featured a raised cast driver's hatch with an opening vision flap as well as mounting bolts in a ring around the base of the gun tube. Morozov's new medium tank design received a skeptical response.\\"Rem Ulanov's memories\\" It was believed that putting a high-speed 12-cylinder engine with a working displacement of almost 40 liters perpendicular to the direction of travel would cause problems, including breaking the connecting rods. It was believed that decreasing the displacement of the engine compartment for the purpose of enlarging the fighting compartment was unnecessary and that moving the turret rearwards would limit the elevation angle of the main gun. However, it turned out that even though rotating the engine complicated the transmission by introducing an additional reduction gear - gear-train and fan drive, it also solved many problems. The cover of the engine and transmission compartment turned along with the radiator; this allowed easier access to the engine, transmission and batteries. The significant decrease in the length of the engine compartment allowed the turret to be moved rearwards, which in turn moved its rotation axis and the center of mass\\"historycy.pl\\" to the center of the hull, increased the accuracy of the main gun and decreased a chance that the turret could get stuck after getting hit in the turret ring with a projectile that ricocheted. The thickness of the frontal armor protection more than doubled without disturbing the center of mass or drastically increasing the weight of the tank. At the beginning of World War II the thickness of T-34 armor was considered enough. Improvements made to the T-34 during World War II included increasing the caliber of the gun (from 76.2 mm to 85 mm) and thickening the armor of the turret. No significant improvements were made to the hull. Increasing the size of the fighting compartment allowed the removal of floor ammunition stowage. The height of the tank was decreased by 300 mm, even though the turret remained almost the same. Removal of the conical pair in the transmission permitted fitting a more compact gear box and improved the control of the brakes and the steering clutch. Visibility from the driver's position was improved. The driver was protected from being splashed by water while the vehicle was fording. The new torsion bar suspension allowed easier crossing of rough ground. Second generation T-44-122 prototype during comparative trials against captured German Panther Second of the two first generation T-44-85 prototypes and T-44-122 prototype during comparative trials The first trials of the T-44-122 prototype took place in February and March 1944, but were unsuccessful due to gun failure, and the gun was returned to the No. 9 factory for repair. In April and May 1944 the trials were resumed. Aside from standard trials, the T-44-122 was put in competitive trials against a captured German Panzerkampfwagen V Panther medium tank and the second of two first generation T-44-85 prototypes. The practical rate of fire was two to three rounds per minute due to the cramped turret and long, heavy ammunition. The vehicle had a very limited storage of only 24 rounds and this was considered insufficient for a medium tank. As a result, all further development of the T-44-122 prototype was cancelled. Like the T-44-122 prototype, one of the two first-generation T-44-85 prototypes went through competitive trials against a captured German Panzerkampfwagen V Panther medium tank. The second of the two first-generation T-44-85 prototypes was put in competitive trials against the T-44-122 prototype. The second prototype uncovered additional faults in the design. By May 1944 two second-generation prototypes were being built. These featured the driver's position moved rearwards so that his hatch was partially on the hull roof. The driver's vision flap was reduced to a plain square flap with rounded lower corners, in line with the glacis plate. These prototypes had prominent collars at the base of the gun tube, without the mounting bolts which were present in the first generation prototypes. The two prototypes also have differences between each other. One prototype had a splashboard on the glacis plate while the other had a smooth uncluttered glacis plate. One of these prototypes passed trials at the NIBT proving grounds near Kubinka in June and July 1944. This prototype weighed 31.3 tonnes and was armed with an 85 mm ZiS-S-53 gun. The turret front armour thickness was increased to 115 mm. Hulls side armour thickness was increased to 75 mm. =T-44A= The third generation prototype, which received the designation T-44A, was completed after the Morozov Design Bureau had moved back to Kharkiv in Ukraine. The hull upper front armour (glacis plate) thickness was increased to 90 mm and the turret front armour thickness was increased to 120 mm. Even though it was more heavily armoured, the weight went down to 30.7 tonnes. This vehicle had a new V-44 12-cylinder 4-stroke diesel engine of 520 hp (388 kW) at 1,800 rpm, which allowed the tank to travel at a speed of 60.5 km/h. This prototype had the splashboard on the glacis plate like one of the second generation T-44-85 prototypes. This prototype featured some other differences from the earlier prototypes, including the fact that drivers hatch was moved entirely to the roof of the hull and the vision flap was deleted from the design and replaced by a vision slot in the glacis plate. After trials conducted in August and September 1944 and after it received several upgrades (which increased the weight of the vehicle to 32 tonnes), the T-44A officially entered service with the Red Army on the 23 November 1944, but did not see combat during World War II. =T-44-100 and T-54= One of the two T-44-100 prototypes. Notice the 100 mm gun, 12.7 mm DShK anti-aircraft heavy machine gun mounted on the loader's hatch and 6 mm thick anti-HEAT sideskirts protecting the sides. This example does not have a splashboard on the glacis plate. Even with its innovative technology and better armor protection the T-44A still used the same 85 mm ZiS-S-53 tank gun as fitted on the T-34-85 medium tank. The army needed a new tank armed with a more powerful 100 mm gun. At the end of 1944 the designers had three types of 100 mm guns at their disposal - the D-10 (which had already proved itself in combat use in the SU-100 tank destroyer) as well as prototypes of the ZiS-100 and LB-1 (LB stands for Lavrenty Beria). The T-44 tank armed with the 100 mm tank gun originally received the designation T-44B. Two projects were started, both based on the T-44A. The development of the first one started in October 1944 at the design bureau of the Stalin Ural Tank Factory No. 183, located in Nizhny Tagil. The design stage was completed in December and the prototype was ready in February 1945. The trials conducted between March and April gave positive results and the vehicle eventually entered service with the Red Army as the T-54. The tank had almost the same hull and drive train as the T-44A. Differences included thickened front armour (120 mm on the upper section and 90 mm on the lower section) and a different hatch and vision slot for the driver. The turret had increased diameter to 1800 mm. There was thicker armour (180 mm on the front, between 90 mm and 150 mm on the sides and 30 mm on the roof). The armament included the 100 mm D-10TK tank gun as well as two 7.62 mm GWT machine guns. The tank was powered by a new V-54 12-cylinder 38.88 liter water-cooled diesel engine developing 520 hp (388 kW) at 2,000 rpm. The fuel capacity was increased (530 liters in the internal fuel tank and 165 liters in the external fuel tank). The external fuel tanks were connected to the fuel system. The rubber rollers on the roadwheels were widened. The weight was increased to 35.5 tonnes, which reduced the maximal road speed to 43.5 km/h. The maximal road operational range increased to 360 km. Because of positive results seen in trials, it was decided to modernize the tank before starting production (for more details about it see the T-54/55 article) as well as to put the new tank's turret onto two modified serial T-44A tanks. This was done in 1945 and the two prototype tanks received the designation T-44-100. One of the prototypes was armed with a D-10TK tank gun while the other one was armed with a LB-1 tank gun. Like the second generation T-44-85 prototypes, the two T-44-100 prototypes had differences between each other. One prototype had a splashboard on the glacis plate while the other did not. They both had the 12.7 mm DShK anti-aircraft heavy machine gun fitted to the loader's hatch, 6 mm thick anti-HEAT sideskirts protecting the sides and two cylindrical fuel tanks in the back which increased the fuel capacity to 1035 liters.\\"Modern Tanks\\" These cylindrical fuel tanks were later used on Soviet main battle tanks as additional fuel tanks. Further development of the T-44 was canceled and all the attention was directed towards the development of the new T-54 main battle tank. Description The T-44 had a typical tank layout: the driving compartment at the front, the fighting compartment in the middle and the engine compartment in the rear. The original intention was to retain the high mobility and speed of a T-34 and to provide the T-44 with heavier armour protection against large-caliber tank guns. This was accomplished by adding thicker armour but reducing the internal volume of the hull. The T-44 had a lower profile than the T-34, and was potentially simpler to manufacture. Although the T-44 used many components of the T-34, it had a new hull, and a modified model V-2 diesel engine, suspension and transmission. Reflecting trends in other designs in this period, the T-44 was designed without the hull radio operator/machine gunner position present in many older designs. This was done for a number of reasons. The extensive machine gun firing port in the glacis plate (which was present in the T-34 medium tank) was a weak spot in the armour. In the T-34, this firing port and the driver's hatch were exploited during World War II by the Germans fighting the T-34s. Shooting the machine gun was ineffective as it was inaccurate due to obscured vision. It was considered inefficient to transfer reports through an additional member of the crew and therefore these duties were transferred to the commander. The space saved was used for a fuel tank and to increase the ammunition load. The driver's hatch was on the left side of the hull roof. The tank had an improved hull design, longer and wider than the T-34 but slightly lower thanks to the relocation of the air filter, with thicker armour, and was simpler to construct. The hull had a sloped glacis plate, vertical sides, and a slightly beveled rear. Most tanks had a splashboard on the glacis plate although there are pictures of T-44A tanks without them. It protected the upper part of the vehicle from splashes of mud or water. There were three mounts for rectangular stowage bins on the fenders (two on the right fender and one on the left fender). There were four mountings for cylindrical fuel tanks on the fenders (two per side). This was changed in the T-44M which used rectangular fuel cells. During its service the tank proved to be not entirely adapted to winter conditions, due to an incomplete draining of the cooling system, caused by a water pump system that had been modified to reduce engine height. A small shaft would break after the impeller pump froze. The repair of the shaft, considering the field conditions, proved very impractical and required three people. Two people had to hold a third person by the legs and lower him into the engine bay, where he had to loosen the fastening and remove the broken shaft. Then, he was pulled out and lowered back down to install the new shaft. He was repeatedly lowered until the new part was secured. Another serious problem discovered during the winter conditions was that the crews of the T-44A suffered from frostbite because of the complete lack of a heating system. The driver was supposed to be protected from rain and snow by a removable Tarpaulin cover with a small glass window. However, this was not successful and its use was deemed impractical. Second generation T-44-85 prototype during trials. This unit has no splashboard, and the gap between the second and third roadwheels. Second generation T-44-85 prototype during trials at NIBT proving grounds near Kubinka, summer 1944. Notice driver's vision flap was reduced to a plain square flap with rounded lower corners, in line with the glacis plate, a prominent collar at the base of the gun tube and the splashboard on the glacis plate. The T-44 had a compact torsion-bar suspension instead of the T-34's Christie coil springs, although it retained the Christie method of engagement between the slotted drive wheel and track lugs. The suspension had five large spoked road wheels and 'dead' 500 mm wide track from the T-34. The hull and wheels were virtually identical to the early T-54 main battle tanks although the original T-44 had the T-34's 'spider' road wheels and a narrow, inset drive wheel at the rear. The T-44 was the last Soviet medium tank with paddle-type tracks. The mechanism for tensioning them was significantly better on the T-44 than it was on the T-34. On the T-34, the first two lug-nuts on the crank had to be loosened and then the crank pounded with a sledge hammer in order to separate it from the hull. After the track was tensioned, the crank had to be set back in place with a sledge hammer. The whole process required up to three people. On the T-44, the same task could be carried out by one person, without the help of a sledge-hammer. The roadwheels were spaced evenly from each other except for a prominent gap between two of the roadwheels. The T-44-85 and T-44-122 prototypes had a gap between the second and third roadwheels like in the T-34 but the T-44A had a gap between the first and second roadwheels. This arrangement of wheels was continued in the T-54 and T-55 main battle tanks. The roadwheels sometimes started to 'fall home' after 2,500 km. To increase the service life of the road wheel, a slight camber of the paired road wheels was tried. However, this resulted in greater stress on the outer rollers. When the tank crosses 20 km of rough ground it can pick up about a ton of dirt along the way. The new V-44 12-cylinder 4-stroke diesel engine, developing 520 hp (388 kW) at 1,800 rpm, was a more powerful version of the T-34's model V-2 with a new planetary manual 5-speed transmission system, filtration system, improved cooling system, horizontally placed water and oil pumps\\"mkmagazin\\" and an improved fuel system which increased its power output, although the tank retained the side clutches from the T-34. The new engine gave the T-44 a maximal road speed of 53 km/h and maximal cross country speed of 20 km/h to 25 km/h as well as maximal road range of 350 km. The engine could become worn out after the tank traveled 3,000 km. When that happened, the oil pressure would drop to 2-3 atmospheres and under heavy loads, the engine would start smoking, spewing out black smog out of the side of the tank. The engine deck had two transverse ventilation grilles at the rear. The exhaust port was on the rear left hand side of the hull. The tank could cross 1 m high vertical obstacles, 2.5 m wide trenches, 32¬∞Technika Wojskowa LWP. XXX lat rozwoju 1943 - 1973, page 57 side slopes and 60¬∞ gradients and ford 1.3 m deep water obstacles without preparation. Because driver's hatch was moved from the glacis plate and positioned so that he exited the vehicle perpendicularly instead of crawling out of the hatch, his seat received an elevating mechanism. While in a relatively safe area the driver could elevate his seat to look outside of the tank, providing greater visibility and easier access to the controls. While in combat the driver lowered his seat back into the tank and had to rely on the vision slot protected by triplex (three-layer glass). While in this position the pedals of the main clutch, the fuel supply, and incline brake were positioned much higher and the levers of the steering clutch and gear shifting became inconvenient to operate. Early examples had transmission problems. While the driver was switching gears, two gears could engage simultaneously, which caused a broken gear pinion. This and other gearbox related problems were solved in a 1961 T-44M modernization with the introduction of a gearbox from the T-54 main battle tank. T-44A was armed with an 85 mm ZiS-S-53 tank gun as well as two 7.62 mm DTM light machine guns. One of these machine guns was mounted to fire through a tiny hole in the center of the glacis plate. Because the tank's crew did not include a radio operator/machine gunner, the driver operated this light machine gun. The gun was mounted in a fixed position and could only be aimed by turning the tank. The main gun was placed in a centrally placed turret along with a coaxially mounted 7.62 mm DTM light machine gun. The ZiS-S-53 tank gun could penetrate around 100 mm of armour at range of 1000 m. The gun could be elevated or depressed between -5¬∞ and +25¬∞. It wasn't stabilized. Like in the T-34 and SU-76 SPG, hot cartridge-cases were rolling under the feet of the crew. The crew was also subjected to gases from the main gun every time after it was fired. The tank carried 58 rounds for the 85 mm ZiS-S-53 tank gun and 1890 rounds for 7.62 mm DTM light machine guns. The turret was cast, with a prominent horizontal casting seam, shaped like an elongated hexagon, with sloped sides and overhang all around. It resembled a longer, better armoured T-34-85 turret. It had a cast gun mantlet with a small but prominent ring/collar around the base of the tank gun tube. The turret roof had a raised commander's cupola on the left and loader's hatch on the right with a low dome-shaped ventilator behind it. The turret was moved with an electric motor. The front armour of the turret was 120 mm thick while the side armour was 75 mm thick. The hull was made of rolled welded steel. The glacis plate was 90 mm thick while the side armour was 75 mm and the bottom armour was 20 mm thick. T-44 tanks could be fitted with additional 30 mm thick armour plates on the sides of the hull and the turret. Additional spaced armour panels could be fitted to the sides of the hull. The T-44A could be fitted with the PT-3 mine clearing device. It had a radio in the back of the turret with an antenna at the center of the left side of the turret. The vehicle was equipped with a submachine gun. The vehicle lacked an NBC (nuclear, biological and chemical) protection system and a night vision device. Production history The T-44A officially entered service with the Red Army on 23 November 1944 but the production started in October. Production took place at the new Factory No. 75 (Zavod 75) in Kharkiv which used the buildings of the old KhPZ Factory No. 183 which were recaptured from Germans on 23 August 1943. To restore the factories to working order, engineers, workers, machines and tools were sent from Stalin Ural Tank Factory No. 183, located in Nizhny Tagil. The original plans were that the factory would produce 300 T-44As a month. However, only 25 were built by the end of 1944. In 1945, 940 were built, making a total of 965 (190 tanks built in 1944 and 1945 were completed by the end of the war). An additional 858 T-44As were made in 1946-1947. The T-34 continued to account for 85% of medium tank production through 1950,Zaloga & Johnson 2004:6 and development of a more advanced medium tank with a more powerful 100 mm gun proceeded. The relatively brief production run ended in 1947 with a total of 1,823 T-44A tanks built. The reasons for such a brief production run included mechanical teething problems, \\"Military Equipment Photo Gallery\\" the end of the war which reduced the Red Army's need for a new tank, and the design's inability to successfully fit a 100 mm tank gun. It was replaced on the production lines by the T-54-1 main battle tank, which was more mechanically reliable and could mount a 100 mm gun. The superior T-54-2 would replace T-34 production at the Omsk Factory No. 183 in 1950, and the T-54/55 main battle tank series would remain in production until 1981. Service history The T-44 was issued to three tank brigades mustered on 15 September 1944 for training purposes, but these formations (6th Guards, 33rd Guards, and 63rd Guards Tank BrigadesZaloga et al. 1997:61) were re-equipped with T-34-85 tanks prior to entering the Battle of Berlin and Prague Offensive. The T-44A was not used operationally during World War II in Europe for several reasons, including the fact that the Red Army was not ready to accept a new tank because of lack of sufficient spares and technical specialists who could repair and maintain the new tanks as well as the fact that many of the tank crews would have to be retrained. However, three tanks were sent to the 100th Special Tank Company which tested them on the Eastern Front. Many T-44As were immediately sent after they were produced in the Far East regions of the Soviet Union. The first tanks arrived there before the end of the war and were used operationally during the last three days of fighting. They continued to arrive after the war and eventually around 600 T-44As were stationed there.\\"Inne Oblicza Histori\\" Due to the Cold War, the USSR decided to keep the tank secret.\\"Czo≈Çgi Info\\" It was never shown publicly during military parades and pictures were never shown publicly until the secrecy was dropped. There is almost no photographic evidence of T-44s stationed in East Germany or while being used briefly in Poland for training Polish tank crews in 1952 nor during the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956, although it is factually known that T-44 tanks were sent to these various places (there are only a small number of known photographs of T-44A tanks in Hungary in existence). In 1961, a number of T-44As were modernized with parts from the T-54 main battle tank and other upgrades and received the designation T-44M. In 1963, some T-44Ms were converted into T-44MK command tanks. In 1965 some T-44Ms were converted into BTS-4A armoured recovery vehicles. In 1966, a number of T-44As and T-44Ms received the \\"Cyclone\\" gun stabilizer and the designations T-44S and T-44MS, respectively. According to most sources T-44S, T-44M and T-44MS tanks remained in service with the Soviet Army until the end of the 1970s, when their usefulness as tanks had ended. It is possible that they remained in storage until the beginning of the 1990s. Many T-44Ms were converted into artillery tractors, tank tractors and engineer tanks. A number of T-44A, T-44S, T-44M, T-44MK and T-44MS tanks were converted into fixed defensive positions; some of which are known to have been positioned on the border with the People's Republic of China. Unlike most Soviet made weapons the T-44 wasn't exported. After the cloak of secrecy was lifted in the 1960s, when the tank was already becoming obsolete, it was used in the war movies: Father of a Soldier, Liberation, Battle of Moscow, Red Cherry, The Star, and Downfall. In the first, it was used to portray a T-34. In Liberation, Red Cherry, The Star, and Downfall it was visually modified with additional plates to resemble the Tiger I heavy tank. Some T-44 and T-34 tanks were visually modified to represent German Panzerkampfwagen IVs. They were made for Soviet- era film studios and were used in a number of movies about battles on the Eastern Front. They were also used during a 2004 re-enactment of the Battle of Moscow.\\"Film Panzer\\" Some T-44As were given to military museums including one in Brest in today's Belarus, and one in the Museum of the Great Patriotic War, Moscow, Poklonnaya Hill Victory Park. One of two T-44-100 prototypes is in the Kubinka Tank Museum near Moscow. T-44 displayed in the Museum of the Great Patriotic War, Moscow, Poklonnaya Hill Victory Park. In conjunction with the video game company Gaijin Entertainment, creators of the World War II multiplayer combat game War Thunder, the tank was restored to full operating condition over the course of nearly six months, painted a parade camouflage in the style of the 29th Tank Corps of the 5th Guards Mechanized Army.

It had an increased ammunition stowage (from 58 rounds to 61 rounds), new R-113 and R-120 radio sets, a heater and infra-red night sight, TVN-2 night vision device for the driver as well as another fuel tank which increased the fuel capacity by 150 liters to 650 liters and 800 liters with additional fuel tanks. The maximal road operational range of the tank increased to 420 km - 440 km. The original fenders were replaced with T-54-style ones. The catwalk stowage was changed to the flat T-54 rectangular external fuel tanks with embossed circle and cross. Hence the T-44M had a different arrangement of additional fuel tanks and stowage boxes. There were four rectangular external fuel tanks as well as two smaller ones on the right fender and fastenings for four spare track chain links, one rectangular external fuel tank as well as two smaller ones and one stowage box. The tank received a mount for an antiaircraft machine gun.

Carramar is located 30 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Fairfield and is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. History Carramar's name comes from an aboriginal word meaning \\"shade of trees\\". The first land grant in the area was made by Governor King in 1803. One of Sydney's oldest trees, the Bland Oak was planted in the suburb in the 1830s by William Bland. When the railway station opened here in 1924 it was called South Fairfield. However, the area had been known as Carramar since at least the 1850s and the name of the station was changed to Carramar in 1926. A post office was opened the following year as the local population began to swell.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, p.146 , page 52 Demographics According to the 2016 census of population, there were 3,550 residents in Carramar. 37.6% of people were born in Australia. The most common other countries of birth were Vietnam 14.6%, China (excludes SARs and Taiwan) 3.6%, Iraq 3.1%, New Zealand 2.6% and Lebanon 2.3%. 26.5% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Vietnamese 18.2%, Arabic 11.2%, Cantonese 3.7%, Mandarin 3.3% and Spanish 3.1%. Most common religious groups were Catholic 22.3%, Buddhism 15.4%, Islam 15.2%, No Religion 14.4% and Not stated 9.7%. Christianity was the largest religious group reported overall (47.9%). Schools Carramar Public School features an infants and primary school, although the school technically falls within the suburb of Villawood. Commercial areas and transport Carramar has a small commercial shopping centre, and a small industrial area. Carramar railway station is on the Bankstown Line of the Sydney Trains network.

Carss Park is part of the St George area. Location Carss Park is a picturesque suburb around Carss Point, overlooking Kogarah Bay on the Georges River. The suburb is surrounded by the suburbs of Kogarah Bay, Allawah, South Hurstville and Blakehurst. Carss Park is a mostly residential area featuring some valuable real estate with water views and bushland surrounds. History The area was purchased from the Crown on 28 January 1853 by Jonathan Croft for A¬£123. It changed hands several times before being acquired in 1863 by William Carss, a cabinet-maker, who called his property Carss Bush. He built a stone cottage in the 1860s called Carss Park Cottage. After William Carss died, his family continued to live in the house, including daughter Mary Carss. William had left the estate to the trustees of the Sailor Home in Sydney. When Mary died this clause in her father‚Äôs will was honoured and the estate passed to the trustees in 1916. In 1921 the Blakehurst Progress Association made attempts to secure Carss Bush for a public park and Kogarah council was able to acquire the land for the people. Carss Bush Park was dedicated on 26 January 1924 and 150 lots were auctioned on the same day for development. Many of the streets on the new estate were named after Aboriginal tribes.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 53  Heritage listings  Carss Park has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 74 Carwar Avenue: Carss Cottage Commercial area A small shopping strip is located on the Carwar Avenue near the intersection with the Princes Highway, containing a bottleshop, chemist, hairdresser, newsagent, petrol station and supermarket.

He has been confused with Bulgarinus, another 15th-century jurist. He was the most celebrated of the famous Four Doctors of the law school of the University of Bologna, probably because his school promoted Roman emperors, such as Justinian I, as the highest authority. Bulgarus was regarded as the Chrysostom of the Glossators, being frequently designated by the title of the \\"Golden Mouth\\" (os aureum). He died in 1166 at a very advanced age. According to popular tradition, all four of the famous Four Doctors (Bulgarus, Martinus Gosia, Hugo de Porta Ravennate and Jacobus de Boragine) were pupils of Irnerius; however, while there is currently no insuperable difficulty in substantiating this claim with regard to Bulgarus, Friedrich Karl von Savigny considered the evidence to be insufficient to support this claim. Martinus Gosia and Bulgarus were the chiefs of two opposite schools at Bologna, corresponding in many respects to the Proculians and Sabinians of Imperial Rome, Martinus being at the head of a school that accommodated the law in a manner that his opponents referred to as the \\"equity of the purse\\" (aequitas bursalis), whilst Bulgarus adhered more closely to the letter of the law. Martinus's school was also generally more flexible in its interpretation of the law, whereas Bulgarus's school was much more orthodox and adhered more closely to the tradition of the \\"Corpus Iuris Civilis\\". Bulgarus' school ultimately prevailed. Joannes Bassianus, Azo and Accursius all numbered amongst its notable adherents, each of whom, in turn, went on to exercise a commanding influence over the course of legal studies in Bologna. Decretals with Glossa ordinariaAt the Diet of Roncaglia in 1158, Bulgarus assumed the leading role amongst the Four Doctors, and was one of the most trusted advisors to the emperor Frederick I. His most celebrated work is a notable commentary, De Regulis Juris, which was at one time printed amongst the writings of Placentinus. However, this commentary has since been properly credited to its true author, Cujacius, based on internal evidence contained in the additions annexed to it, which were undoubtedly penned by Placentinus himself. This commentary is the earliest extant work of its kind emanating from the school of the Glossators. According to Savigny, it is a model specimen of the excellence of the method introduced by Irnerius, and a striking example of the brilliant results obtained in a short period of time by virtue of a constant, exclusive study of the sources of law.

Traditionally there were four levels of courts: the Kirk Session (at congregational level), the Presbytery (at local area level), the Synod (at a regional level) and the General Assembly (the Church's highest court). However, the synods were abolished in the early 1990s. Scottish local government was reorganised in 1975, creating a new system of regions and districts to replace the long-standing counties and burghs. The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland also ordered a major reorganisation of presbyteries in the mid-1970s, redrawing presbytery boundaries to make them broadly contiguous with the then-new local government boundaries. An example was the union of the former Presbyteries of Cupar and St Andrews, creating a new Presbytery of St Andrews (which also included the Parishes of Newport-on-Tay, Wormit and Tayport, previously in the Presbytery of Dundee). This new Presbytery's boundaries mirrored the North East Fife District Council. Following further local government reorganisation in the 1990s (replacing regions and districts with a single-tier system of councils), it was proposed to further considerably reduce the number of Presbyteries (possibly to as few as seven). This proposal was rejected by the General Assembly. Since 2003 several presbyteries have voluntarily sought permission to merge, as described below. Despite these mergers the existing Presbytery numbering system is being retained, albeit now with some gaps. It is the presbyteries which have oversight of parishes and pastoral responsibility for parish ministers, and the Kirk Sessions of the individual parishes are subordinated to them. A parish minister is answerable to the Presbytery, not to the Kirk Session.

It is the largest unit in the Wisconsin National Guard.http://www.wisgov.state.wi.us/journal_media_detail.asp?locid=19&prid;=3116 History M-60A1/A3 Patton main battle tanks are lined up in the staging area at the Dundalk Marine Terminal, Port of Baltimore, after being offloaded from the vehicle cargo/rapid response ship USNS Antares (T-AKR-294). The tanks were used by the 32nd Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) (Separate), Wisconsin Army National Guard, during Exercise REFORGER '86. Formed in 1967 from the inactivated 32nd Infantry Division, the Red Arrow Brigade consisted of three battalions of light infantry as well as support and engineer units. The 32nd's shoulder patch, a line shot through with a red arrow, originated in the division's tenacity in piercing German lines during World War I that no other army could breach. It then became known as the Red Arrow Division. After 1967 the brigade was a separate brigade of the Wisconsin Army National Guard, not part of any larger infantry division. In April 1971, the brigade was converted to a mechanized brigade and became the 32nd \\"Red Arrow\\" Infantry Brigade (Separate) (Mechanized). In 1984‚Äì85 the brigade included 2‚Äì127 Infantry (Mech); 1‚Äì128 Infantry (Mech); 1st Battalion, 632nd Armor Regiment; 1‚Äì120 Field Artillery; Troop E, 105th Cavalry; and the 32nd Engineer Company.Isby and Kamps 1985, 384. In January 1986 the 32nd Brigade participated in REFORGER '86. The entire brigade deployed from Wisconsin, with all of its equipment, to Germany. In October 1996, the brigade lost its separate status and became a divisional brigade, assigned to the 34th \\"Red Bull\\" Infantry Division. The 34th Division had its headquarters in Minnesota.

Castlereagh is north-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Penrith and is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. History The suburb is one of the most historic sites in Australia's colonial history, being one of the five Macquarie towns officially proclaimed on 6 December 1810. Governor Lachlan Macquarie recorded the following in his journal \\"the Township for the Evan or Nepean District I have named Castlereagh in honor (sic) of Lord Viscount Castlereagh\\", Secretary of State for War and the Colonies 1805‚Äì1806. He, in turn, was named after Castlereagh in Northern Ireland. The official Government and General Order issued from Government House, Sydney was dated 15 December 1810. The earliest known European development was the building of Hadley Park, between what is now Castlereagh Road and the Nepean River. Charles Hadley was given a grant in 1803, and his house, Hadley Park, was built . It still stands, largely intact. It has been said that it is difficult to overestimate the significance of this building. It was one of the earliest buildings in the colony and is \\"probably unique in its condition and setting\\". The property is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register. Nepean Park, , is also situated on Castlereagh Road, was built by convict labour for John Single. A notable two-storey farmhouse in the Georgian style, it was acquired by the Dixon family in 1934. It is listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate and the NSW State Heritage Register. Castlereagh Post Office opened on 1 April 1857 and closed in 1967. After two hundred years, the rich river flats still provide for a thriving agricultural industry along the Nepean River. Many of Penrith district's pioneering families had originated from Castlereagh. The suburb's historical importance is reflected in its many surviving farmhouses, outbuildings, churches and cemeteries.  Heritage listings  Castlereagh has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Castlereagh Road: Upper Castlereagh Public School * 14-278 Old Castlereagh Road: Hadley Park Demographics According to the 2016 census, there were 1,171 residents in Castlereagh. 78.8% of people were born in Australia and 82.6% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were Catholic 39.4%, Anglican 21.3% and No Religion 13.7%. Transport Castlereagh Road is one of the important transport link in Sydney connecting the Hawkesbury and Penrith regions. Schools The area has historic public school buildings, the Upper Castlereagh Public School and residence. Situated on Castlereagh Road, superseding a Wesleyan schoolhouse on the opposite side of the road, this was designed by G. A. Mansfield and constructed by James Evans, 1878-1879. There is also a K-12 parent-controlled Christian school, The Lakes Christian College. There is also a K-6 Principal controlled Primary school, Lower Castlereagh Public School, now known as Castlereagh Public School.

Her parents divorced when she was just a year old as they believed that they were too young to be married. Subsequently, Zmijanac was raised by her maternal grandmother because her parents went abroad to work. Zmijanac was discovered by singer ≈†aban ≈†auliƒá as a teenager living with her mother in Vienna, Austria. She also cites Esma Red≈æepova and Safet Isoviƒá next to ≈†auliƒá as the biggest influences on her vocal performance. Zmijanac released her debut single in 1979, but rose to prominence in the early eighties by appearing in popular television movies and series as a singer. She then released her first album, Ljubi me, ljubi, lepoto moja (Kiss Me, Kiss Me, My Beauty), under PGP-RTS, which saw moderate success. Zmijanac scored her first hit in 1985 with \\"Nevera moja\\" (My Infidelity), written by her then husband Miroljub Aranƒëeloviƒá Kemi≈°. The following year she released her fifth record, Doƒëi ≈°to pre (Come As Soon As You Can), which sold over 600,000 copies. During this period she had her first national tour and was recognised as one of the biggest artists in the former Yugoslavia, only competing with Lepa Brena. Zmijanac saw success again with Jedan si ti (You're One of a kind) in 1987. Istina (The Truth) was then released in 1988, which knowably included a duet with then less known Bosnian singer-songwriter Dino Merlin, titled \\"Kad zamiri≈°u jorgovani\\" (When Lilacs Smell). The album marked her biggest success, overall selling record-breaking 1,1 million copies according to Zmijanac. On October 19 the following year, she gave birth to daughter Nikolija, while married to Vladimir Jovanoviƒá, who at the time worked as the marketing chief at PGP-RTS. In 1990, she had another best-selling album with Svatovi, but under new label Komuna. Zmijanac then embarked on her fourth tour when she sold out ten concerts in a row in Belgrade's Sava Centar. In 1994, Zmijanac released Idem preko zemlje Srbije (I'm Going Ove the Country of Serbia), followed by another regional tour. Malo po malo (Little by Little) was then released in 1995 under Diskos. In 1997, she released Posle svega, dobro sam (After Everything, I'm Fine), where she collaborated with rock musician Bajaga on Da budemo noƒáas zajedno (To Be Together Tonight). In 2000, she published her autobiography. Zmijanac subsequently released ≈†ta ostanu kad padnu haljine (What's Left When Dresses Have Fallen) under Grand Production in 2003. The album's title track was written by ≈Ωeljko Joksimoviƒá. In 2010, Zmijanac took part in the reality TV series Survivor Srbija VIP: Philippines broadcast on TV Prva alongside her daughter, where she was second contestant to be voted out. Zmijanac also appeared in the seventh season of Farma on RTV Pink in 2016. She eventually walked out from the show, after receiving news about Nikolija being pregnant.

It is in the local government areas of The Hills Shire and City of Hawkesbury.Gregory's Sydney Street Directory, Gregory's Publishing Company, 2007 Cattai's state electoral district is Hawkesbury, and its federal electoral divisions are Berowra and Macquarie. Cattai is bounded in the north-west by the Hawkesbury River and is traversed by Cattai Creek. It encompasses the heritage-listed Cattai Estate, located within Cattai National Park at the junction of the Creek and the River.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p. 2/12 The Georgian house was built between 1804 and 1821 by former Magistrate Thomas Arndell, with further additions being made in the 1860s. Cattai is also home to a historic rural public primary school that was founded in 1886. The suburb was originally home to the Darug Indigenous Australians before being settled in the early nineteenth century. History Indigenous Peoples = The locality of Cattai was the home of the Darug people who occupied a large expanse of Greater Western Sydney. The Darug people are thought to have occupied the locality of Cattai for more than 20,000 years. The name Cattai was originally thought to have derived from an Aboriginal word with an unknown meaning. However, it was more likely named by the First Fleet Assistant Surgeon and Magistrate Thomas Arndell who built a homestead called 'Caddie'. The homestead is now called Cattai Estate and resides in Cattai National Park. The suburb of Cattai has henceforth been considered a misnomer of 'Caddie'. = Settlement = Europeans settlers moved into the area in 1794 to sustain the food shortages of Sydney. Following protests by the Dharug people over the loss of their traditional hunting an fishing lands, soldiers were sent to the area in 1795. Cattai Post Office opened on 26 November 1906 and closed in 1994. Cattai Public School was established in 1886. Arndell Anglican College was independent secondary college that was established in Cattai in 1990, until it moved to its current site of Oakville in 1994.  Heritage listings  Cattai has a number of heritage-listed sites, the most notable being Cattai Estate on Wisemans Ferry Road. Demographics Population = At the 2016 Census, there were 790 people in Cattai. The median age was 41. =Culture and language= The majority of people from Cattai were born in Australia (85.0%).

Both are glossy black with a chestnut saddle. Its taxonomic family is also known as that of the (New Zealand) \\"wattlebirds\\" and includes the two subspecies of the k≈çkako (the extant North Island kokako monitored on island sanctuaries, and the extinct South Island kokako) as well as the extinct huia. All members of this family have coloured fleshy appendages on either side of the beak known as \\"wattles\\". In the case of the saddlebacks, they are a vivid red in colour. Taxonomy Its common name is derived from the demarcated brown plumage on its back which resembles a saddle. The Maori name comes from the particular sound of one of this species' common calls: ti- e-ke-ke-ke-ke. There are two species: * North Island saddleback ‚Äî Philesturnus rufusater * South Island saddleback ‚Äî Philesturnus carunculatus The saddlebacks appear to be a remnant of an early expansion of passerines in New Zealand and are two of five New Zealand wattlebirds of the family Callaeidae, the others being the extinct huia, the endangered North Island k≈çkako, and the probably extinct South Island k≈çkako. New Zealand wattlebirds have no close relatives apart from the stitchbird, and their taxonomic relationships to other birds remain to be determined.  Behaviour  Saddlebacks are larger than other arboreal insectivorous birds in New Zealand forests, measuring up to 25 cm (10 in) in length and weighing up to 75 grams (somewhat larger than a common blackbird). They will tear pieces of bark from tree trunks to find insects beneath, which are then dispatched and consumed with their short, robust, and unusually strong beak, but they will also feed on the ground in leaf litter. Their diet is not strictly insectivorous in nature and they have been observed eating fruit and drinking nectar. Poor fliers like their close relative the k≈çkakos, saddlebacks mostly bound from branch to branch but can fly noisily over short distances. Territorial birds, saddlebacks display antagonistic behaviour in this regard on three levels of intensity, singing out at dawn to mark their territory, making threat displays, which can include head bobbing, tail fanning, and warbling displays (at the same time the wattles become dilated), and finally, when a direct challenge is made to a bird's territory, fights can occur in which combatants attempt to grapple with the wattles of their foe. The birds are notoriously fearless and noisy, and would frequently enchant European naturalists in the 19th century with their behaviour. Saddlebacks will nest in epiphytes, tree fern crowns, or holes in tree trunks. They have a tendency to nest near the ground, and their fledglings will also leave the nest to hop around in a typically noisy fashion on the ground while they build up strength in their wings. Saddlebacks and peoplePlace in MƒÅori culture= Saddlebacks traditionally held a strong place in Maori superstitious belief; their cries were viewed as good omens when they came from the right, and bad omens when they came from the left. Their cheeky nature is reflected in the MƒÅori legend that tells of how the birds acquired its distinctive chestnut coloured saddle. Fresh from his battle to ensnare the sun, a thirsty Maui (a virtual demi-god in MƒÅori folklore) asked the to bring him some water. The bird rudely pretended not to hear his request, at which Maui, becoming angry, seized it with his still fiery hand, leaving a brown scorch mark across its back. = Decline, present day conservation and recovery = Their breeding behaviour (nesting near the ground and fledglings hopping noisily around on the ground) make them especially vulnerable to predation from introduced mammals, including mustelids, Norway and ship rats. This resulted in both species swiftly disappearing from the New Zealand mainland. By the beginning of the 20th century, both species were confined to a respective island in the far north: Hen Island off Northland, and in the far south, Big South Cape Island off Stewart Island/Rakiura. Rats arrived on Big South Cape Island in 1963, accidentally introduced as they escaped from the boats of visiting muttonbirders. Only a swift rescue operation by the New Zealand wildlife service (the present day Department of Conservation) saved both species from extinction by the skin of their teeth, while the rats' predation soon condemned to extinction the local populations of the South Island snipe, bush wren and greater short-tailed bat. Saddleback have since been relocated to island nature reserves around New Zealand, and also to mainland fenced sanctuaries. Since roughly 2015, sporadic sightings and evidence of breeding has been confirmed in Polhill Reserve, which neighbours the fenced Zealandia wildlife sanctuary. These have been the first sightings on New Zealand's un- fenced mainland since the bird was declared extinct on the mainland in 1910. The recovery of the saddleback is considered by many to be one of New Zealand's greatest conservation success stories.

(James Augustine Healy, ordained in 1854, and Patrick Francis Healy, ordained in 1864, were of mixed-race.) A former slave who was baptized and reared Catholic, Tolton studied formally in Rome. He was declared Venerable by Pope Francis in June 2019. He was ordained in Rome on Easter Sunday of 1886 at the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran. Assigned to the diocese of Alton (now the Diocese of Springfield), Tolton first ministered to his home parish in Quincy, Illinois. Later assigned to Chicago, Tolton led the development and construction of St. Monica's Catholic Church as a black \\"national parish church\\", completed in 1893 at 36th and Dearborn Streets on Chicago's South Side. BiographyEarly life= Augustus Tolton was born in Missouri to Peter Paul Tolton and his wife Martha Jane Chisley, who were enslaved. His mother, who was raised Catholic, named him after an uncle named Augustus. He was baptized Augustine in St. Peter's Catholic Church near Rensselaer, Missouri, a community in northeast Missouri. His master was Stephen Elliott. Savilla Elliot, his master's wife, stood as Tolton's godmother. =Freedom= How the members of the Tolton family gained their freedom remains a subject of debate. According to accounts Tolton told friends and parishioners, his father escaped first and joined the Union Army. Tolton's mother then ran away with her children Samuel, Charley, Augustine, and Anne. With the assistance of sympathetic Union soldiers and police, she crossed the Mississippi River and into the Free State of Illinois. According to descendants of the Elliott family, though, Stephen Elliott freed all his slaves at the outbreak of the American Civil War and allowed them to move North. Augustine's father died of dysentery before the war ended. =Vocation= After arriving in Quincy, Illinois, Martha, Augustus, and Charley began working at the Herris Tobacco Company where they made cigars. After Charley's death at a young age, Augustine met Peter McGirr, an Irish immigrant priest from Fintona, County Tyrone, who gave him the opportunity to attend St. Peter's parochial school during the winter months, when the factory was closed. The priest's decision was controversial in the parish. Although abolitionists were active in the town, many of McGirr's parishioners objected to a black student at their children's school. McGirr held fast and allowed Tolton to study there. Later, Tolton continued studies directly with some priests. Despite McGirr's support, Tolton was rejected by every American seminary to which he applied. Impressed by his personal qualities, McGirr continued to help him and enabled Tolton's study in Rome. Tolton graduated from St. Francis Solanus College (now Quincy University) and attended the Pontifical Urbaniana University, where he became fluent in Italian language as well as studying Latin and Greek. =Priesthood= Tolton in 1887Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. GM Rewell & Company, 1887. p439-446 Tolton was ordained to the priesthood in Rome in 1886 at age 31. His first public Mass was in St. Peter's Basilica on Easter Sunday in 1886. Expecting to serve in an African mission, he had been studying its regional cultures and languages. Instead, he was directed to return to the United States to serve the black community. Tolton celebrated his first Mass in the United States at St. Boniface church in Quincy. He attempted to organize a parish there, but over the years met with resistance from both white Catholics (many of whom were ethnic German) and Protestant blacks, who did not want him trying to attract people to another denomination. He organized St. Joseph Catholic Church and school in Quincy, but ran into opposition from the new dean of the parish, who wanted him to turn away white worshipers from his services. After reassignment to Chicago, Tolton led a mission society, St. Augustine's, which met in the basement of St. Mary's Church. He led the development and administration of the Negro \\"national parish\\" of St. Monica's Catholic Church, built at 36th and Dearborn Streets on the South Side, Chicago. The church nave seated 850 parishioners and was built with money from philanthropists Mrs. Anne O'Neill and Katharine Drexel. St. Monica's Parish grew from 30 parishioners to 600 with the construction of the new church building. Tolton's success at ministering to black Catholics quickly earned him national attention within the Catholic hierarchy. \\"Good Father Gus\\", as he was called by many, was known for his \\"eloquent sermons, his beautiful singing voice, and his talent for playing the accordion.\\" Several contemporaneous news articles describe his personal qualities and importance. An 1893 article in the Lewiston Daily Sun, written while he worked to establish St. Monica's for African American Catholics in Chicago, said, \\"Father Tolton ... is a fluent and graceful talker and has a singing voice of exceptional sweetness, which shows to good advantage in the chants of the high mass. It is no unusual thing for many white people to be seen among his congregation.\\" Among Chicago‚Äôs Catholics, Fr. Tolton found a warm welcome from the Jesuits of Holy Family Church and St. Ignatius College (now St. Ignatius College Prep, 1076 W. Roosevelt Road). They invited him to stay in the Jesuit residence in the 1869 school building and to preach at the High Mass at Holy Family on Jan. 29, 1893. Holy Family was then the largest English-speaking parish in Chicago, composed primarily of Irish immigrants and their children who were also struggling to establish a home in the sometimes unwelcoming city. Fr. Tolton appealed ‚Äúat all the masses‚Äù and collected $500 ($14,000 in 2020) for St. Monica Church, which was dedicated on Jan. 14, 1894. FOOTNOTES: ‚Äú150 Years of Faith and Education‚Äù and ‚ÄúClaver Society to be renamed Tolton Society,‚Äù Saint Ignatius Magazine 11 no. 2 (Summer 2019); ‚ÄúSecured a $500 Collection,‚Äù Chicago Tribune, Feb. 6, 1893; ‚ÄúSt. Monica‚Äôs is dedicated,‚Äù Chicago Record, Jan. 15, 1894. The True Witness and Catholic Chronicle in 1894 described him as \\"indefatigable\\" in his efforts to establish the new parish. Daniel Rudd, who organized the initial National Black Catholic Conference which was held in 1889, was quoted in the November 8, 1888, edition of The Irish Canadian as commenting about the Congress by saying, \\"For a long time the idea prevailed that the negro was not wanted beyond the altar rail, and for that reason, no doubt, hundreds of young colored men who would otherwise be officiating at the altar rail today have entered other walks. Now that this mistaken idea has been dispelled by the advent of one full-blooded negro priest, the Rev. Augustus Tolton, many more have entered the seminaries in this country and Europe\\". Another indication of the prominence given Tolton by parts of the American Catholic hierarchy was his participation, a few months later, on the altar at an international celebration of the centenary of the establishment of the first U.S. Catholic diocese in Baltimore. Writing about it in the New York Times edition of November 11, 1889, the correspondent noted that \\"As Cardinal Gibbons retired to his dais [on the altar at the Mass], the reporters in the improvised press gallery noticed for the first time, not six feet away from him in the sanctuary among the abbots and other special dignitaries, the black face of Father Tolton of Chicago, the first colored Catholic priest ordained in America.\\" =Death= Tolton's grave in Quincy, Illinois Tolton began to be plagued by \\"spells of illness\\" in 1893. Because of them, he was forced to take a temporary leave of absence from his duties at St. Monica's Parish in 1895. At the age of 43, on July 8, 1897, he collapsed and died the following day at Mercy Hospital as a result of the heat wave in Chicago in 1897. After a funeral which included 100 priests, Tolton was buried in the priests' lot in St. Peter's Cemetery in Quincy, which had been his expressed wish. After Tolton's death, St. Monica's was made a mission of St. Elizabeth's Church. In 1924 it was closed as a national parish, as black Catholics chose to attend parish churches in their own neighborhoods. Legacy and honors * Tolton is the subject of the 1973 biography From Slave to Priest by Sister Caroline Hemesath. The book was reissued by Ignatius Press in 2006. * In 1990, Sister Jamie T. Phelps, O.P., an Adrian Dominican Sister and then-faculty member of the Theology Department at Catholic Theological Union, initiated the Augustus Tolton Pastoral Ministry Program in consultation with Don Senior, President of CTU, the theology faculty, and representatives of the Archdiocese of Chicago, to prepare, educate, and form black Catholic laity for ministerial leadership in the Archdiocese of Chicago. * The Father Tolton Regional Catholic High School opened in Columbia, Missouri, in 2011. * Augustus Tolton Catholic Academy opened in the fall of 2015 in Chicago, Illinois. Tolton Academy is the first STREAM school in the Archdiocese of Chicago. A focus on science, technology, religion, engineering, arts, and math sets it apart as a premier elementary school in Chicago. Tolton Academy is located at St. Columbanus Church. Cause for canonization On March 2, 2010, Francis George of Chicago announced that he was beginning an official investigation into Tolton's life and virtues with a view to opening the cause for his canonization. This cause for sainthood is also being advanced by the Diocese of Springfield, Illinois, where Tolton first served as priest, as well as the Diocese of Jefferson City, Missouri, where his family was enslaved. On February 24, 2011, the Roman Catholic Church officially began the formal introduction of the cause for Tolton's sainthood, which must take place in a public session. He is now designated Servant of God Fr. Augustus Tolton. Also at this time there was the establishment of historical and theological commissions, which will investigate the life of Tolton, and the Father Tolton Guild, which is responsible for the promotion of his cause through spiritual and financial endeavors. George assigned Joseph Perry, Auxiliary Bishop of Chicago, to be the Diocesan Postulator for the cause of Tolton's canonization. On September 29, 2014, George formally closed the investigation into the life and virtues of Tolton. The dossier of research into Tolton's life went to the Vatican, where the documents collected to support his cause will be analyzed, bound into a book called a \\"positio\\" or official position paper, and evaluated by theologians, and then, supporters hope, passed on to the pope, who can declare Tolton \\"venerable\\" if he determines Tolton led a life of heroic virtue. On December 10, 2016, Tolton's remains were exhumed and verified as part of the canonization process. Following procedures laid out in canon law, a forensic pathologist verified that the remains (which included a skull, femurs, ribs, vertebrae, pelvis, and portions of arm bones) belong to Tolton. Also found were the corpus from a crucifix, part of a Roman collar, the corpus from Tolton's rosary, and glass shards indicating his coffin had a glass top. After verification, the remains were dressed in a new chasuble and reburied. On March 8, 2018, historians that consult the Congregation for the Causes of Saints unanimously issued their assent to Tolton's cause after having received and favourably reviewed the positio that was presented to them. On February 5, 2019, the nine-member theological commission unanimously voted to approve the cause. It must now go to the cardinal and bishop members of the Congregation for approval before it is passed to the pope for his final confirmation. On June 12, 2019, Pope Francis authorized the promulgation of a \\"Decree of Heroic Virtue\\", advancing the cause of Servant of God Augustine Tolton. With the promulgation of the decree of heroic virtue, Tolton was granted the title ‚ÄúVenerable‚Äù. If the case progresses, the next stage would be beatification, followed by canonization.

He signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers organization and worked his way up the organization based almost solely on his glove, speed on the bases and tenacity. In 1954, Hoak's patience was rewarded by a spot on the Dodgers' roster. During his two seasons with the Dodgers, Hoak shared third base duties with Jackie Robinson and Billy Cox. In 1955, the Dodgers defeated the New York Yankees in the World Series to win their only championship in Brooklyn. Hoak played third base in place of Robinson in the seventh and deciding game of that Series‚Äîthe only World Series game Robinson did not play in during his career when his team was in the World Series. After the season, Hoak was traded to the Chicago Cubs. In 1956, Hoak batted .215 with 5 home runs and 37 runs batted in, and also set a National League record by striking out six times in one game, against six different pitchers, in which 48 players were used in a 17-inning marathon on May 2, won by the visiting New York Giants 6-5. Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia After the 1956 season, the Cubs traded Hoak to the Cincinnati Redlegs in a five-player deal. In 1957 Hoak improved his batting average to .293, after leading the league well into May at over .400, and set career highs in home runs (19) and runs batted in (89), as well as leading the National League in doubles with 39. In a game against the Milwaukee Braves on April 21, Hoak was involved in a controversial play that would lead to a change in the rules. He was on second base and teammate Gus Bell was on first, when Wally Post hit a ground ball to short. Hoak broke up a potential double play by fielding the ball himself and flipping it to Milwaukee shortstop Johnny Logan. Hoak was called out for interference, but Post was given a single on the play. The day before, Johnny Temple let Bell's ground ball hit him with the same result, Temple being called out for interference and Bell being awarded a single. The two incidents prompted league presidents Warren Giles and Will Harridge to jointly announce a rule change that declared both the runner and batter out if the runner intentionally interferes with a batted ball, with no runners allowed to advance. (Without the new rule, it was sometimes advantageous for a runner to touch a batted ball, because doing so avoided a double play. In the plays already mentioned, Temple and Hoak were out according to a still-existing rule: a runner is out if a batted ball touches him in fair territory before it touches a fielder, with the batter getting a single and no runner advancing unless forced.) In 1957 Hoak made his only All-Star appearance, but it also would be mired in controversy‚Äîthough not of Hoak's doing. At the time, as they do currently, fans had the right to vote for the starters (minus the starting pitchers). As a result, a ballot stuffing campaign by Reds fans resulted in Hoak, Post, Temple, Bell, Ed Bailey, Roy McMillan, and Frank Robinson being voted into the starting lineup. First baseman George Crowe, the eventual team home run leader with 31, was the only Red not selected; the fans instead voted for Stan Musial. (Crowe would be selected to the All-Star team in 1958‚Äîthe only Red so honored.) Commissioner Ford Frick removed Bell and Post from the starting lineup and replaced them with Willie Mays and Hank Aaron; Bell remained on the team as a reserve, but Post was taken off altogether. Frick also stripped the fans of the right to vote for the starters, which they had held since 1947 and would not hold again until 1970 (ironically, the Reds‚Äô newly opened Riverfront Stadium would host the All-Star Game that year). In the third inning of that game, Hoak grounded out to shortstop Harvey Kuenn in his only plate appearance. He was replaced by Eddie Mathews. Hoak batted .261 for the Reds during the 1958 season before being traded, along with Harvey Haddix and Smoky Burgess, to the Pittsburgh Pirates for four players (one of whom was Frank Thomas) in January 1959.Thomas traded to Cincinnati in 7-player deal It was Hoak's throwing error that cost Haddix his perfect game against the Braves after the pitcher had retired 36 batters in a row on May 26, 1959. The Braves went on to win that game, 1-0. In 1960, Hoak batted .282 on a Pirates team that won the World Series; like the 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers, Pittsburgh defeated the Yankees in seven games. The Pirates won the 1960 Series on Bill Mazeroski's ninth-inning home run in Game Seven. During the Pirates‚Äô championship season, Hoak finished second in National League Most Valuable Player Award vote to teammate Dick Groat. Hoak batted a career-high .298 during the 1961 season, but slumped to .241 in 1962. After the 1962 season, the Pirates traded him to the Philadelphia Phillies for Pancho Herrera and Ted Savage.Pirates trade Don Hoak for Phil Outfielder Savage He batted .231 during the 1963 season, then was released in May 1964 after making only six plate appearances‚Äîall in pinch-hitting roles. Hoak retired forthwith, but returned to the Phillies as a scout for the final month of the season‚Äîduring which the Phillies lost the pennant to the St. Louis Cardinals by one game after leading the National League by 6 1/2 games with two weeks remaining. Don Hoak also played in the Dominican Republic during the 1956 season with the Escogido team. In those days the radio announcer called him \\"el loquito Hoak\\" (crazy Hoak) for his risky plays which contributed to his team winning several games and the season. In a final series, a game was won when he stole home after making the pitcher nervous several times, moving between third and home. Hoak and Jill Corey Hoak was married to singer/actress Jill Corey, whom he first met at Forbes Field during the Pirates' 1960 season. Hoak pursued Corey for a year afterward, even convincing her to break up with her boyfriend, a Brazilian diplomat. The two wed on December 27, 1961; the marriage bore a daughter, Clare. Post-playing career After retiring as an active player, Hoak worked as a Pirates' broadcaster in 1965 and 1966, a coach for the Phillies in 1967, and a manager in the Pirates' farm system from 1968 until 1969. In 1968, he managed the Salem Redbirds of the Carolina League to an 85-55 record.https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/team.cgi?id=8d54904f Hoak then moved up to the Pirates' Triple A club, the Columbus Jets of the International League, whom he managed to a 74-66 record in 1969.https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/team.cgi?id=e0a50456 Career statistics In 11 seasons covering 1263 games, Hoak compiled a .265 batting average (1144-for-4322) with 598 runs, 214 doubles, 44 triples, 89 home runs, 498 runs batted in, 64 stolen bases, 523 base on balls, 530 strikeouts, .345 on-base percentage and .396 slugging percentage. Defensively, he recorded a .959 fielding percentage. In the postseason, in 2 World Series (1955 and 1960) he batted .231 (6-for-26) with 3 runs and 3 runs batted in . Death During the 1969 season, the Pirates' managerial post was left vacant when Larry Shepard was fired with one week remaining, and Alex Grammas served as interim manager for the final five games. After two successful minor league seasons, Hoak believed himself a contender to manage the parent club‚Äîif not the new Pirates' manager. Instead, the team announced on October 9 that Danny Murtaugh, who managed the Pirates' 1960 World Championship team, was to return for what would be his third of four stints with the club. (Murtaugh had resigned after the 1967 season for medical reasons, and accepted a position in the Pirates' front office. He asked to reclaim the managerial position after the 1969 season, and was re-hired after receiving medical clearance.) Hoak never received word of Murtaugh's hiring from the Pirates officials; his wife delivered the news to him. Shortly thereafter, Hoak witnessed his brother-in- law's car being stolen from the driveway of the Hoak house. Hoak got into his own car and gave chase. He suffered a heart attack during the pursuit, but managed to stop his vehicle at Amberson Towers just before collapsing. He lay in his car for 20 minutes without anyone‚Äôs interceding. A doctor who claims he had been driving behind Hoak at the time eventually got out of his own car and performed cardiac massage before an ambulance transported Hoak to the hospital. However, despite efforts to save his life, Hoak died 10 minutes after arrival. Jill Corey would claim for decades that her husband had died of a broken heart because the Pirates had passed him over.

She was amongst the first in her field to identify and define the characteristics of children on the autistic spectrum and establish the genetic component of the condition. Her work focused principally on a group of socially withdrawn, eccentric and schizoid children which she followed for over 20 years. In 1996 she translated a landmark paper by Grunya Sukhareva which may be the earliest description of autistic symptoms in children. Early life She was born on 1 March 1924 in Berlin, Weimar Germany, to Friedel (n√©e Saloman) and Walther Wolff, a patent lawyer. She was brought up in Wetzlar. When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933 she moved with her family to Hampstead, England. She attended South Hampstead High School, going on to study medicine at the University of Oxford, graduating in 1947.  Career  In her early career she worked at John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, Royal Liverpool hospital and Whittington Hospital, London. She undertook post-graduate training in psychiatry at Maudsley Hospital under psychiatrist Sir Aubrey Lewis, developing an interest in the psychological problems of children. After Maudsley Hospital she practised in Cape Town where she was the country's first child psychiatrist. She then moved to New York to work as a research fellow before settling in Edinburgh in 1962. In 1966 she became a consultant psychiatrist at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children.

Frances Noel Stevens Hall (1874‚Äì1942), widow of victim Edward Wheeler Hall and a defendant in the 1926 murder trial. A calling card of Reverend Edward Wheeler Hall was found at the Hall-Mills murders crime scene in 1922. The Hall‚ÄìMills murder case involved Edward Wheeler Hall, an Episcopal priest, and Eleanor Mills, a member of his choir with whom he was having an affair, both of whom were murdered on September 14, 1922, in Somerset, New Jersey, United States. Hall's wife and her brothers were accused of committing the murders, but were acquitted in a 1926 trial. In the history of journalism, the case is largely remembered for the vast extent of newspaper coverage it received nationwide; it has been regarded as an example of a media circus. It would take the Lindbergh kidnapping trial in the 1930s to eclipse the high profile of the Hall-Mills murder. Discovery of the bodies On September 16, 1922, the bodies of a woman (Eleanor Mills) and a man (Edward Hall) were discovered in a field near a farm. Both bodies were on their backs, both shot in the head with a .32-caliber pistol, the man once and the woman three times. The bullet entered the man's head over his right ear and exited through the back of his neck. The woman was shot under the right eye, over the right temple and over the right ear. A police officer at the scene noticed that the woman's throat had been severed, and maggots were already in the wound, indicating the death occurred at least 24 hours earlier. The bodies appeared to have been positioned side by side after death. Both had their feet pointing toward a crab apple tree. The man had a hat covering his face, and his calling card was placed at his feet. Torn-up love letters were placed between the bodies. A jurisdictional issue complicated the initial investigation, as the crime scene was near the Middlesex County and Somerset County border. New Brunswick (Middlesex County) police arrived first, but the crime scene was actually in Franklin Township (Somerset County). While the authorities addressed the confusion, curiosity-seekers trampled the scene, took souvenirs, and passed Hall's calling card among the crowd. The physical evidence was thus severely compromised. The woman was identified as Eleanor Reinhardt Mills (born 1888), the wife of James E. Mills (1878‚Äì1965). She was wearing a blue dress with red polka dots, black silk stockings, and brown shoes. She had worn a blue velvet hat that was on the ground near her body, and her brown silk scarf was wrapped around her throat. Her arm had a bruise, and there was a tiny cut on her lip. Her left hand had been positioned, after death, to touch the man's right thigh. An autopsy four years later showed that her tongue had been cut out. The man was identified as Edward Wheeler Hall (born 1881), a New Brunswick Episcopal priest. He was found with his right arm positioned, after death, to touch the woman's neck. His hat covered his face, which concealed the gunshot wound to his head. He wore a pair of glasses. There was a small bruise on the tip of his ear, and abrasions were found on his left little finger and right index finger. A wound was found five inches (127 mm) below his kneecap, on the calf of his right leg. His watch was missing, and there were coins in his pocket. Investigation The suspects were Hall's wife, Frances Noel Stevens, her two brothers, Henry Hewgill Stevens and William \\"Willie\\" Carpender Stevens, and a cousin, Henry de la Bruyere Carpender. The original 1922 investigation by Joseph E. Stricker (1870‚Äì1926) yielded no indictments. Continued speculation in the New York Daily Mirror, fueled by comments made by a man associated with one of Mrs. Hall's housekeepers, led New Jersey governor A. Harry Moore to order a second investigation and a trial in 1926. Henry Carpender won a bid to be tried separately from the three others accused; ultimately, Carpender was never tried. Trial The trial began on November 3, 1926, in the Somerset County Courthouse in Somerville, New Jersey, with Charles W. Parker and Frank Cleary presiding as judges. It lasted about 30 days, and garnered huge national attention, largely because of the social status of the wealthy Stevens and Carpender families. The prosecuting attorney was Alexander Simpson. Defense attorneys were Robert H. McCarter (a former New Jersey Attorney General) and Timothy N. Pfeiffer. Joseph A. Faurot was the testifying fingerprint expert. Raymond C. Stryker was the foreman of the jury. The prosecution's key witness was Jane Gibson, a pig farmer on whose property the bodies were discovered. The defense portrayed her as uneducated and \\"crazy,\\" and attempted to ruin her credibility. Gibson's account varied, differing when told to the police, to newspapers, and at the trial (at which she testified from a hospital bed rolled into the court room). Frances Stevens Hall and her two brothers had the motive and the means for the murder, but there was not enough evidence to convict them. VictimsEleanor Reinhardt Mills= Eleanor Reinhardt was married to James E. Mills. They lived at 49 Carman Street in New Brunswick, New Jersey. James was acting sexton at St. John the Evangelist Episcopal Church in New Brunswick and full-time janitor at the Lord Stirling Elementary School in New Brunswick. Eleanor and James had two children, Charlotte E. Mills (1906‚Äì1952) and Daniel Mills (1910‚Äì1992). Eleanor, James, and their children were buried in Van Liew Cemetery, North Brunswick, New Jersey. =Edward Wheeler Hall= Edward Wheeler Hall married Frances Noel Stevens on July 20, 1911. He was raised in Brooklyn, New York, receiving his theological degree in Manhattan. After graduation, he moved from New York to Basking Ridge, New Jersey, and then to St. John the Evangelist Episcopal Church in New Brunswick. Edward was living at 23 Nichol Avenue in New Brunswick at the time of the murder. He was buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. The New York Times; December 4, 1926 SuspectsHenry de la Bruyere Carpender= Henry de la Bruyere Carpender (1882‚Äì1934) was born on May 15, 1882, to John Neilson Carpender and Anna Neilson Kemp. He lived with his wife Mary Nielson at the corner of Suydam Street and Nichol Avenue in New Brunswick. Henry was a cousin of Frances Stevens Hall and her brothers, whose mother was a Carpender. He worked as a Wall Street stockbroker. Although he was an initial suspect, he was never brought to trial. He died on May 26, 1934, and was buried in Elmwood Cemetery, North Brunswick. =Frances Noel Stevens Hall= Frances Noel Stevens was born on January 13, 1874, to Francis Kerby Stevens (1840‚Äì1874) and Mary Noel Carpender (1840‚Äì1919). Frances and Edward married on July 20, 1911. She was buried on December 21, 1942, in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York with her husband. In the prosecution's scenario, she instigated the murder of her cheating husband. Her home was later bought by Rutgers University and used as the residence of the Dean of Douglass Residential College. She was related to many of the wealthy families of New Brunswick, including the Carpenders, Nielsons, and possibly the Johnsons of Johnson & Johnson. =Henry Hewgill Stevens= Henry Hewgill Stevens (1869‚Äì1939) was born on November 10, 1869. He married Ethel Griffin on June 27, 1901. He was a retired exhibition marksman and lived in Lavallette, New Jersey. The prosecution contended that he fired the shots. Henry testified that he was fishing miles away from the murder on the night of the killing, and three witnesses corroborated his testimony. He died of a heart attack on December 3, 1939, in Lavallette, New Jersey. =William Carpender Stevens= William \\"Willie\\" Carpender Stevens (1872‚Äì1942) was born on March 13, 1872. He owned a .32-caliber pistol like the one used in the murder, although the firing mechanism was supposed to have been filed down so that he could not hurt himself with it. In the prosecution's scenario, he provided the weapon, and his fingerprint was found on a calling card left at the scene of the crime. Willie was a colorful character on the witness stand, delivering credible and not unsympathetic testimony. He was incapable of holding a job and spent most of his time hanging out at a local firehouse. Although the syndrome had not yet been clinically described during his lifetime, Willie Stevens's eccentric personality was consistent with Asperger syndrome, an autism spectrum disorder, although no conclusive diagnosis can be made. He died on December 30, 1942. WitnessJane Gibson, the pig woman= Jane Gibson (ca 1870‚Äì1930) and her son William lived in an old barn that had been converted into living space, just off of De Russey's Lane. She raised hogs, and the press called her the \\"pig woman\\". She told the investigators that her dog was barking loudly about 9:00 pm on the night of the murder. She went outside of her house and saw a man standing in her cornfield. She rode her mule toward Easton Avenue to approach the man. As she got closer she saw that there were four people standing near a crab apple tree. She heard gunshots and one of the figures fell to the ground, presumably dead. She testified that a woman screamed \\"Don't!\\" three times. She said she turned her mule in the opposite direction and headed back to her house, then heard more gunshots; when she looked back at the tree, she saw a second person fall down, presumably dead. She testified that she had heard a woman shout the name \\"Henry.\\" Case and trial in fact and fiction After the trial, Mrs. Hall brought a defamation suit against the New York Daily Mirror. The New York Times accounts were actually more voluminous, but less slanted; they reported on all aspects of the trial and dedicated more space to the Hall-Mills case than any previous trial in American history. (That record would soon be eclipsed by another New Jersey trial, the Lindbergh case.) The Hall-Mills murders have been much written about in both fact and fiction. Damon Runyon was one of the reporters of the trial, as was famed mystery novelist Mary Roberts Rinehart. Willie Stevens was later the subject of an essay by James Thurber. The trial inspired the novel The Crime by Stephen Longstreet as well as Frances Noyes Hart's novel The Bellamy Trial, a pioneering work that helped establish the genre of the courtroom mystery and was turned into a film in 1929. Even before the trial, the silent film The Goose Woman (1925), starring Louise Dresser and Jack Pickford, capitalized on Jane Gibson's story and statements; the film was remade as The Past of Mary Holmes in 1933. Attorney and liberal activist William Kunstler published a 1964 book titled The Minister and the Choir Singer, which he re-released with added editorial material in 1980 as The Hall-Mills Murders. In his book, Kunstler theorized that the Ku Klux Klan had been responsible for the couple's demise, based on the facts that the Klan was a very violent organization and was active in New Jersey in the 1920s. But he acknowledged that the Klan had not previously killed anyone in the state, and his reasons for thinking the group would target this particular couple were admittedly speculative. Gerald Tomlinson's Fatal Tryst: Who Killed the Minister and the Choir Singer? is the most detailed exploration of the case written to date and concludes that the Stevens siblings were the guilty parties. Additional images and a more detailed account of the local perspective and effect on the once-rural community of Franklin Township can be found in books written by William B. Brahms. In her book Careless People: Murder, Mayhem and the Invention of The Great Gatsby (2013), Sarah Churchwell speculates that parts of the ending of The Great Gatsby (1925), by F. Scott Fitzgerald, were based on the Hall-Mills Case. Based on her forensic search for clues, she asserts that the two victims in the Halls-Mills murder case inspired the characters who were murdered in The Great Gatsby.

His partner, Detective Sergeant Matthew Fox, immobilizes two of the assailants; Deke chases the third upstairs to a subway-station platform, taunts him and incapacitates him with a scarf. That day in London, terrorist Heymar Reinhardt (alias Wulfgar) bombs a department store. In New York City, DaSilva and Fox serve a high-risk warrant in the Bronx. They raid a drug-distribution spot, where they discover corrupt police officers among the dealers. After the arrests DaSilva meets his estranged wife, Irene, and tells her he loves her; although she initially rebuffs his advances, they eventually reconcile. Wulfgar meets a member of his network at a party to receive travel documents and money. Suspicious of the delivery man, Wulfgar kills him and three Metropolitan Police Service officers sent to arrest him. He escapes, and the police superintendent berates lead investigator Inspector Hartman. In Paris, Wulfgar meets his partner, Shakka, and learns that his handlers are ostracizing him because the bombing killed a number of children. Wulfgar undergoes facial surgery to alter his appearance and decides to move his terrorist campaign to New York City. Lt. Munafo transfers DaSilva and Fox to the newly-formed ATAC (Anti-Terrorist Action Command) squad, where they meet Hartman. Hartman and DaSilva clash, since Hartman believes that American police are not ruthless enough to deal with a terrorist such as Wulfgar. Although he hesitates to condone killing Wulfgar, DaSilva absorbs his new training and begins to understand the terrorist. In New York, Wulfgar moves in with a flight attendant and kills her when she discovers his arsenal. Acting on a tip, Munafo orders DaSilva and Fox to search every nightclub the flight attendant had visited. They find Wulfgar in a nightclub and, after a shootout and foot chase through the subway, Wulfgar first takes a woman hostage and uses her as a human shield, preventing DaSilva from shooting. Wulfgar then escapes by slashing Fox's face with a knife, enraging DaSilva, who vows to kill Wulfgar. At the hospital, Fox admonishes DaSilva for not shooting. The ATAC squad guards a United Nations function at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Shakka, infiltrating the party in disguise, corners Hartman on an escalator and kills him. After hijacking a tram car, Wulfgar executes the wife of the French ambassador while DaSilva watches from a hovering police helicopter. Wulfgar demands that DaSilva board the tramway to receive an infant that he wishes to be taken to safety. DaSilva is winched up to the aerial tram and confronts Wulfgar, demanding to know why Wulfgar killed the woman. Wulfgar says that he killed her because he wanted to; considering himself a speaker for people who cannot speak for themselves, he says that all people are victims. The police agree to Wulfgar's demands for a bus to escort him and the hostages to an airport, where a jet will be waiting. Wulfgar and Shakka hide among the hostages. As they board the bus, DaSilva plays a hidden recording of a Hartman lecture denouncing Shakka. Shakka, enraged, breaks away from the hostages and Fox shoots her with a sniper rifle. Wulfgar escapes by driving the bus off a ramp into the East River, but after searching the area, the police cannot find him. At Wulfgar's safe-house, ATAC finds detailed information on the individual team members and Irene. Wulfgar breaks into Irene's home, tracking her into the kitchen as she does dishes. As he sneaks up behind to kill her, \\"Irene\\" suddenly turns to face Wulfgar, revealing DaSilva in disguise. As DaSilva aims his revolver at Wulfgar, Wulfgar lunges at him; DaSilva fires twice at the terrorist, sending his body crashing into the street. DaSilva walks out of the house and sits beside Wulfgar's lifeless body on the front steps of Irene's house.  Cast  * Sylvester Stallone as Detective Sergeant Deke DaSilva * Billy Dee Williams as Detective Sergeant Matthew Fox * Lindsay Wagner as Irene DaSilva * Persis Khambatta as Shakka Holland/Shakka Kapoor * Nigel Davenport as Detective Inspector Peter Hartman * Rutger Hauer as Heymar \\"Wulfgar\\" Reinhardt/Eric * Hilary Thompson as Pam * Joe Spinell as Lieutenant Munafo * Walter Mathews as Commissioner ProductionDevelopment and writing= The story was originally planned as The French Connection III by screenwriter David Shaber at Twentieth Century Fox, with Gene Hackman's Popeye Doyle teamed up with a wisecracking cop (possibly played by Richard Pryor). When Hackman was reluctant to make a third film as Doyle, the idea was scrapped; Universal acquired the rights to the storyline, which Shaber reworked into Nighthawks. The film had two working titles: Attack and Hawks, and pre-production began in 1979. Principal photography began January 1980 (when the final draft of the script was completed), and production ended in April 1980. Because of problems with Stallone's and the studio's interference in post-production, the film was heavily re-edited and was released a year after it was finished. The original director was Gary Nelson‚Äîwho had directed the Disney films Freaky Friday (1976) and The Black Hole (1979)‚Äîbut he was dismissed from the project after a week of production and was not credited. His replacement, Bruce Malmuth, had only one previous film to his credit: a segment of the 1975 portmanteau comedy, Fore Play. Malmuth, en route from Los Angeles to New York City, was unable to make the first day of shooting after Nelson's removal and Stallone shot a scene for one day (the chase in the subway). According to the Directors Guild of America, \\"Anyone signed to work on a movie before the director was engaged cannot replace a fired director, except in an emergency\\"; arbitration resulted in a fine. In preparation for their roles as New York City police officers, Billy Dee Williams and Sylvester Stallone spent several weeks working at night with the New York Street Crimes Unit. =Pre-production= Nighthawks marked the American debut of Dutch actor Rutger Hauer. To accept the role of Wulfgar, Hauer turned down a better-paying role in Sphinx, a 1981 adventure film directed by Franklin J. Schaffner. His mother and his best friend died during the film's production, and he returned to the Netherlands for their funerals. The first scene which Hauer filmed was his death scene, in which he was injured twice. A squib meant to simulate a gunshot exploded on the wrong side, severely burning him; a cable which yanked him (simulating the force of being shot) was pulled too hard, straining his back. Hauer later learned that the cable was pulled forcefully according to Stallone's order, and their relationship was then marked by disagreements. Although stories about their on-set arguments are still told by fans of the film and the actors, Hauer has said in interviews that he did not take the disagreements personally and the greatest problem during filming was the film's difficulty. In a 1993 interview Stallone praised Hauer's performance. > It was a little bit ahead of its time in that I was dealing with urban > terrorism. Now, with the World Trade Center [the 1993 World Trade Center > bombing], it's happening. At the time, people couldn't relate to it, and the > studio [Universal] didn't believe in it. Rutger Hauer's performance held it > together ‚Äî he was an excellent villain. According to Hauer, Nighthawks was a missed opportunity and the issue of international terrorism could have been handled more accurately: \\"We had only to play tags ‚Äì the written story was much more dangerous\\". The subway train used in the chase sequence was retired IND equipment which was preserved as a museum train. Car number 1802 (the last prewar New York City Subway car built) is owned by Railway Preservation Corporation and remains in New York City, where it operates several times a year on museum fan trips with other preserved cars. Number 1802 has since been scrapped. The IND Hoyt-Schermerhorn station in Brooklyn was used as the 57th and 42nd Street stations; a Hoyt- Schermerhorn sign is briefly visible when Stallone tries to pry the doors open as the train pulls out of the station. The train ran on an unused outer track leading from the Court Street station, now the New York Transit Museum. The London department store blown up at the beginning of the film was Arding & Hobbs in Clapham Junction, which belonged to the Allders group at the time. The store is now owned by Debenhams, and during the 2011 England riots its windows were again smashed. =Stunts= Nighthawks stunt coordinator was Dar Robinson. Stallone insisted on performing his own stunts; according to actor Nigel Davenport in an interview for the BBC's Wogan, Stallone performed the scene in which he was winched up to the Roosevelt Island Tramway without a double. About the film's stunts, Stallone posted on the Ain't It Cool News website: > The stunts in the film were pretty extraordinary because they were invented > along the way. Running through the tunnels of an un-built subway station was > very dangerous, but exciting and we were only given one hour to do it. So > that made for an interesting evening. Hanging from the cable car was > probably one of the more dangerous stunts I was asked to perform because it > was untested and I was asked to hold a folding Gerber knife in my left hand > so if the cable were to snap, and I survived the 230 foot fall into the East > River with its ice cold 8 mile an hour current, I could cut myself free from > the harness because the cable when stretched out weighed more than 300 lbs. > I tell you this because it's so stupid to believe that I would survive > hitting the water so to go beyond that is absurd. So I actually thought the > smart move would be to commit hari-kari on the way down and let the cards > fold as they may. P.S. Several years later this cable did snap while testing > it on a 100lb bag of sand. In a 1980 interview with Roger Ebert, Stallone mentioned problems with stunts he wanted to perform himself in Nighthawks. In the scene where he jumps onto a moving train and kicks out the wire-reinforced window, the window broke easily and knocked him off balance. Stallone has had a lifelong fear of heights and said about the helicopter stunt, \\"I've never been so scared in my life\\". According to the actor, he spent 15 weeks in near-total seclusion in his hotel room between scenes and it was the most stressful time of his life. = Post- production = Before its theatrical release, Nighthawks was edited for violence by Universal Studios and the MPAA. Among the scenes cut was a longer disco shootout, and Wulfgar's death scene was heavily edited. Stallone also had a hand in re-editing the film. According to Frank Sanello's book, Stallone: A Rocky Life, two versions of Nighthawks were shown to test audiences: one emphasizing Stallone's character and the other emphasizing Hauer's. Although the version emphasizing Hauer was better received by audiences, Stallone removed some of Hauer's scenes from the film's final version. Stallone posted on the Ain't It Cool News website that Nighthawks \\"was a very difficult film to make namely because no one believed that urban terrorism would ever happen in New York, and thus felt that the story was far fetched. Nighthawks was an even better film before the studio lost faith in it and cut it to pieces. What was in the missing scenes was extraordinary acting by Rutger Hauer, Lindsay Wagner, and the finale was a blood fest that rivaled the finale of Taxi Driver. But it was a blood fest with a purpose\\". Lindsay Wagner said in an interview that Stallone took over the film because of production problems: > He was really incredible. That film ‚Äì I mean, history has shown that he's so > talented in so many different ways. He had made \\"Rocky\\" obviously before > that [directing Rocky II in 1979]. But, it was just incredible. They had > some difficulties. Whatever they were, I wasn't privy to the inside > information about it. We started with one director, and all of the sudden > there was some problems, and Sylvester ended up having to take over the film > and he ended up directing it. So just spontaneously, he just jumped into > that role, and after [that] directed [it]. And, it was incredible watching > him and his multi-talented self whip that film into shape. It was quite > educational in some ways. But, just kind of awe inspiring watching him work > on so many levels at one time. That's not easy. Not many actors can do that. ReceptionBox office= The film recovered its $5-million budget worldwide, grossing $14.9 million in North America and $5 million abroad. =Critical response= Variety called the film \\"an exciting cops and killers yarn\\". In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin praised Hauer's performance: \\"Mr. Hauer's terrorist, in particular, is a sharply drawn character who acts as a driving force within the movie's scheme. Sadism and bloodlessness are his only identifiable characteristics, and yet he behaves memorably wherever he goes\\". Time magazine's Richard Schickel sharply criticized the film: \\"Nighthawks is so moronically written and directed, so entirely without wit or novelty, that there is plenty of time to wonder about its many missing explanations\\". In The Globe and Mail, Jay Scott wrote that the film \\"has a dirty job to do and does it. That is not an endorsement. Thumbscrews and cattle prods are real good at what they do, too\\". According to Newsweek Jack Kroll, \\"This is one of those films that isn't a film but some repulsively complicated business deal\\". In The Washington Post, Gary Arnold described the film as \\"an aggressively shallow police thriller pitting New York undercover cops against international terrorists, suggests what The Day of the Jackal might have looked like if filmed by the producers of Baretta. In order to facilitate a grandstanding, harebrained heroic role assigned to Sylvester Stallone, the filmmakers brush off every opportunity for intelligent dramatization and authentic suspense that the plot would seem to possess\\". The film has a 70% approval rating on the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes based on 20 reviews. Reboot In July 2019, it was announced that a remake was in development from Balboa Productions.https://variety.com/2019/film/features/balboa-prods-sylvester- stallone-braden-aftergood-1203275756/ By May of 2020, Sylvester Stallone announced that a reboot television series is currently in development.

Chifley is 13 km south- east of the Sydney central business district and is part of the City of Randwick. The postcode is 2036. Chifley is surrounded by the suburbs of Matraville, Malabar, Little Bay and Phillip Bay. History The first house built in the Chifley area was Bunnerong House, which was built in 1825. Most land in that area was owned by the Crown; during the Depression of the 1930s, land was leased to people who built homes in the area gradually, over a drawn- out period of time. Chifley was named after Ben Chifley (1885‚Äì1951), Australia's Labor Prime Minister at the end of World War II. Randwick Council made the area, which had been part of southern Matraville, a separate suburb in 1964.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, p.60, A large public housing complex was established in the area the 1960s. It featured a number of four- and five-storey buildings, plus some smaller buildings containing bedsit-style accommodation, in which lounge- room and bedroom are combined in one room.Randwick Website:Retrieved 22 April 2009 Chifley today Chifley today is predominantly residential. Its low to medium-density housing has attracted a larger proportion of families with children than many other suburbs in the City of Randwick. In recent years, much of the original housing stock has been demolished and replaced by larger and taller family homes. There are also a number of townhouses which fill up the streets of Chifley. The suburb contains two schools, Chifley Public School and Matraville Sports High School, and a number of preschool centres. Recreational areas include the Women's Athletic Field and Dr Walters Park. The western edge of Chifley contains a small remnant of Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub, which was once the major flora habitat in this coastal region of Sydney. Efforts are being made to remediate and preserve this area. A number of notable local points of interest adjoin Chifley, including the Long Bay Correctional Centre, Eastern Suburbs Memorial Park and the Bunnerong Equestrian Park.

Herod the Great's kingdom was bequeathed to four heirs, of which Herod Antipas received both Perea and Galilee. He dedicated the city Livias in the north of the Dead Sea. In 39 CE, Perea and Galilee were transferred from disfavoured Antipas to Agrippa I by Caligula. and note 1164 With his death in 44 CE, Agrippa's merged territory was made a province again, including Judaea and for the first time, Perea. and notes 1370, 1376 From that timeTwo cities of Perea, Abela and Iulias (Livias), make an exception, having been kept by Agrippa II (Mason, S. ) to his death c. 100 CE. Perea was part of the shifting Roman provinces to its west: Judaea, and later Syria Palaestina, Palaestina and Palaestina Prima. Attested mostly in Josephus' books, the term was in rarer use in the late Roman period. It appears in Eusebius' Greek language geographical work, Onomasticon, but in the Latin translation by Jerome, Transjordan is used. Gadara or Gadora of Perea (identified as Tell Jadur near Al-Salt ) was the chief city or metropolis of Perea (not to be confused with Gadara of the Decapolis‚àía Hellenistic city). Following the Roman conquest of Judea led by Pompey in 63 BCE, Aulus Gabinius, proconsul of Syria, split the former Hasmonean Kingdom into five districts of legal and religious councils known as synedrion (in Jewish context better known as Sanhedrin) and based at Jerusalem, Jericho, Sepphoris (Galilee), Amathus (Perea) and Gadara (either Perea‚ÄîAl-Salt, Decapolis‚ÄîUmm Qais,: \\"And when he had ordained five councils (œÉœÖŒΩŒ≠Œ¥œÅŒπŒ±), he distributed the nation into the same number of parts.

It is proposed as a form of severe mental illness, whose clinical features resemble those of the common form of postpartum psychosis; since most cases are considered to belong to the bipolar disorder spectrum, it is not a \\"disease in its own right\\". The literature describes nearly 200 proposed cases as of 2020. Episodes of menstrual psychosis have a sudden onset in a previously asymptomatic person, and are usually of brief duration, with full recovery. In most patients, Brockington states that menstrual psychosis is a self-limiting disorder, affecting only a small proportion of the 400 menstrual cycles in a woman‚Äôs life.

It has become one of China's most popular military and civilian transport/cargo aircraft, with many variants produced and exported. Although the An-12 is no longer made in Ukraine, the Chinese Y-8 continues to be upgraded and produced. An estimated 169 Y-8 aircraft had been built by 2010. Design and development In the 1960s, China purchased several An-12 aircraft from the Soviet Union, along with license to assemble the aircraft locally. However, due to the Sino-Soviet split, the Soviet Union withdrew its technical assistance. The Xi'an Aircraft Company and Xi'an Aircraft Design Institute worked to reverse engineer the An-12 for local production. Design of the aircraft was completed by February 1972. Major features of the Y-8 included a glazed nose and tail turret derived from that of the H-6 bomber, a roller-type palletized-cargo-handling device instead of the overhead conveyor, and a gaseous oxygen system as opposed to a liquid oxygen system. The original Y-8 inherited the An-12's twin 23mm cannon tail turret, but this was removed on subsequent variants. The Y-8 equipped with four turboprop engines mounted under the leading edges of non-swept wings. The wings are attached high on the fuselage, and the tricycle landing gear is equipped with low pressure tires. The earliest versions used for the transportation of freight or troops had two side-hinged, inward-opening doors, while later variants used a rearward-facing ramp to facilitate loading and unloading of the payload. Some specialized versions omit the cargo ramp entirely. The Y-8 is capable of carrying troops, dropping supplies, parachute drops, and functioning as an air ambulance. It also can be used for commercial uses as a freighter. It is capable of hauling 20 tons of cargo, approximately 96 soldiers, or about 82 paratroopers in the cargo compartment which is 13.5 metres long, 3 metres wide and 2.4 metres high. It can also carry 60 severely wounded soldiers with their stretchers, 20 slightly injured soldiers and 3 medical attendants. Many variants for specialized roles have been built, but information on them can be vague or difficult to obtain due to the secretive nature of the Chinese military. The Y-8 transport aircraft was put into trial production in the Xi'an Aircraft Factory in June 1972. By December 1974, the first Chinese-assembled Y-8 conducted its maiden flight. Following trial production of the first Y-8s, operations were transferred to the Shaanxi Aircraft Factory. The Shaanxi-produced Y-8s conducted their test flights in December 1975. After a regime of 66 test flights the Y-8 was officially certified for use by the Chinese government. By 1981, the Y-8 entered serial production. Mr. Ouyang Shaoxiu (Ê¨ßÈò≥Áªç‰øÆ) would eventually become the general designer, designing many variants of Y-8, including KJ-200. In the early 1980s, Chinese officials saw US Army recruiting advertisements featuring parachute extraction of an Army jeep along with troops. The PLA was told to develop this kind of capability. But there were two design problems. One, Y-8 wings have very sharp leading edges, so one wing tends to stall before the other, causing the aircraft to roll inverted as it stalls. The second design flaw as that the cargo deck of the Y-8 had a 10 degree downward slope starting at the landing gear. When the PLA Air Force started to test parachute extraction, these two design flaws caused a near disaster. The aircraft was flying too fast, and when the parachute started to extract cargo from the hold, the cargo rolled on the deck until it got to the 10 degree downward slope, and there it became airborne while still inside the aircraft. The cargo hit the top of the cargo door on the way out, making it clear that the Y-8 could not do parachute cargo extraction. In 1986, two engineers from Beijing's Ministry of Aviation visited Lockheed. They could not speak very much English, and the Lockheed-Georgia sales person who met them could not speak Chinese. So for half a day, they did a point-and-grunt tour until they were lucky enough to find a Lockheed employee who could speak Chinese. The Chinese wanted to purchase Lockheed wind tunnel testing on the Y-8 in order to address the stall problem. As a result of these wind tunnel tests, conducted in 1986, Lockheed was given a contract to do a flight test series on the Y-8. Lockheed was told that flight test data was not provided by the Soviets when they helped China build the Y-8 factory. The flight test series was flown by Lockheed test pilot Hank Dees. Hank had flown the test flight series for the Lockheed L-1011 and later for China's Y-12 in Harbin. During this flight test series, Hank Dees flew the aircraft to stall speed and taught Chinese pilots how to anticipate a stall in order to prevent letting the aircraft go inverted. As a result of this test flight series, Chinese pilots started to use the 45 degree flap position. Lockheed's motive for doing flight tests was to demonstrate that China would be better off buying the C-130 rather than trying to improve the Y-8. China did buy C-130's, but the flight test series actually demonstrated that the Y-8 was a more capable aircraft than previously believed. In the late 1980s, Lockheed Martin, the American manufacturer of the C-130 Hercules, helped China to develop a pressurized cabin for the passenger version of Y-8, resulting in two versions: the first had half of the cabin pressurized and later, the second version in which the complete cabin was pressurized. In 2001 and 2002, new consulting arrangements between Antonov and Shaanxi resulted in modernized redesigns to the Y-8's wing and fuselage. As a consequence the redesign allows the Y-8's fuel capacity to be increased by 50 percent. Operational history Y-8's have been used by the PLAAF and PLANAF in a wide variety of roles and some have been supplied to civilian operators. Export aircraft have been supplied to the Myanmar Republic air force, Sudanese Air Force and the Sri Lankan Air Force. Some Y-8 aircraft were used by the Sri Lanka Air Force as makeshift bombers, dropping bombs from the rear doors, during the country's civil war, losing two units, one to Tamil Tiger anti- aircraft defences and the second to mechanical failure. Shaanxi Y-8 of PLA Air Force In Chinese National Day military parade 2009, the Air Force KJ-200 took the role as a lead plane. It had been exported to other countries around the world including Burma, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Tanzania, Venezuela, and possibly others.

Based on a story by Sloan Nibley, the film is about a railroad construction engineer whose plans to build a railroad line between Nevada's Carson City and Virginia City are met with hostility by the locals, who feel the trains will attract outlaws. Filmed on location at Iverson Ranch, Bell Ranch, and Bronson Canyon in Griffith Park, Carson City was Warner Bros.' first film shot in WarnerColor. Plot Mine owner William Sharon (Larry Keating) keeps having his gold shipments held up by a gang of bandits. Sharon hires banker Charles Crocker (Thurston Hall), who happens to have connections in the Central Pacific Railroad, to build a spur line from Virginia City to Carson City, so that the gold can be shipped by rail. Silent Jeff Kincaid (Randolph Scott) is the railroad engineer. However, there is opposition to the railroad, chiefly from another mine owner, Big Jack Davis (Raymond Massey). He doesn‚Äôt own a working mine; he finds it easier to rob from the other owners. Davis is the brains behind the gang holding up Sharon‚Äôs shipments. The technique is to hold up the stagecoach and then provide food and champagne for the passengers, who then don‚Äôt care that the gold is robbed. Kincaid vows to rid Carson City of the bandits, but they frame him on a murder charge. In the climax, Kincaid has to contend with a suspicious landslide which kills some of his workers, trapping others, and a gold bullion heist.

The park is located in San Rafael, California, on the shore of San Pablo Bay. It is known for its hiking and mountain biking trails, scenic views, and open spaces. The park was established in 1976. A district, including the shrimping village and a prehistoric shell midden, were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 for having state-level significance in archaeology, architecture, commerce, settlement, and social history. China Camp State Park, along with the Rush Ranch Open Space Preserve, is part of the San Francisco Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve. HistoryPre-Chinese settlement= Prior to the 1700s, the area now containing the park was inhabited by indigenous Coast Miwok people, who lived by hunting, harvesting acorns from the local oaks, and fishing and gathering seafood from the bay. After the 1775 arrival of the Spanish, who founded the nearby Mission San Rafael Arc√°ngel, the Miwok were largely wiped out within 100 years. In 1844, the Spanish granted much of the land that now comprises the park to Timothy Murphy, an Irish settler who became mayor (alcalde) of San Rafael. Following the United States takeover of California in 1846, Murphy lost most of his land and subsequently died, and the land came into the possession of John and George McNear, two Sonoma County businessmen who established a large dairy ranch and other businesses, such as a quarry and brickyard, on the site. These businesses employed a number of Chinese immigrants, who began to settle in the area. =Chinese settlement= The Chinese shrimp fishing village in 2010 By the 1880s, Chinese Americans had established a village at China Camp of approximately 500 people, many of whom were originally from Canton, China. They supported themselves by shrimp fishing in San Pablo Bay and/or working at local businesses. In its heyday, the village had three general stores, a marine supply store and a barber shop. China Camp was one of approximately 26 such shrimp-fishing villages established along the coast by Chinese Americans, many of whom had moved from San Francisco to escape racial prejudice and persecution. For a brief time following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire, China Camp's population increased to 10,000 as residents of San Francisco's Chinatown fled from the destruction. In the late 1800s, the Chinese American fishermen of China Camp would catch 3 million pounds of shrimp per year, much of which was exported to China and Hawaii. However, the economy of the village was severely harmed by the passage of laws in the early 1900s that outlawed the export of shrimp, closed the height of the shrimping season, and prohibited shrimping with bag nets which were the main method of catching shrimp. As a result, the population of China Camp greatly declined, leaving only one family ‚Äî the Quans ‚Äî carrying on shrimp fishing. In 1914, a new net, the trawl, was invented, which made it possible for the Quans to resume their commercial shrimp fishing enterprise and process 5,000 pounds of shrimp per day. They also operated other businesses such as a general store, a boat rental, and a cafe, which served both villagers and visitors who came to the area for outdoor recreation. =Establishment of state park= By the 1960s, most of the surrounding area including the future park lands was owned or controlled by developer Chinn Ho. The shrimp population of San Pablo Bay had also greatly declined due to water pollution and diversion, although Frank Quan, the grandson of the original Quan patriarch who came to China Camp and the last remaining Quan family member living there, continued to fish, selling most of his catch for bait. In the early 1970s, Gulf Oil expressed interest in large- scale development of the area, including high-rise condominiums and large commercial areas. Local residents and environmental and conservation groups protested the plan, and as a result, the land was sold for approximately $2.3 million in 1976 to the nonprofit California State Parks Foundation, who in turn sold it to the state of California to create China Camp State Park. Chinn Ho donated the 36-acre site of China Camp village for preservation as a memorial to Chinese American history. The general plan established for the park specifically provided that Frank Quan would be permitted to continue living in the village. =2011 proposed closure controversy= In 2011, China Camp State Park was one of 70 parks slated for closure by the state of California in connection with a $22 million state budget cut. Marin County residents voiced concern that if closed, the park could fall into disrepair, including the historic Chinese village which, according to Frank Quan ‚Äî then 85 years old and the last remaining resident of the village ‚Äî was the last of the 26 coastal Chinese fishing villages with enough original structures left to preserve. The California state parks department claimed that China Camp State Park was running at a deficit and that it lacked the money to keep it and other parks open. The nonprofits Marin State Parks Association and Friends of China Camp, along with various other residents and community groups, protested the closure and raised funds to save the park. After an investigation by the Sacramento Bee revealed that the state parks department had an undeclared budget surplus of $54 million, leading to the resignation of the state parks director and the firing of her assistant, an agreement was reached under which China Camp State Park would be jointly funded by the state parks department and the Marin State Park Association, which would also operate the park. Similar agreements were reached for two other Marin County state parks, Olompali State Historic Park and Tomales Bay State Park. A revised agreement in 2013 returned operation of Olompali and Tomales Bay parks to the state, while the nonprofit organization Friends of China Camp continues to operate China Camp State Park, with no funding from the state. Frank Quan died August 2016, at age 90, while still living at the park. Activities The park offers a variety of outdoor activities, including overnight camping, picnic facilities, hiking and biking trails, kayaking, paddleboarding, and sailing. China Camp also celebrates a Chinese-American Heritage Day each August, with lion dances, acrobatic and tai chi demonstrations, arts and crafts sales, activities for children, and a visit by the replica Chinese junk Grace Quan and other historic boats.

The park is also known for the 1975 barbecue murders, in which a local teenager, Marlene Olive, and her boyfriend, Chuck Riley, killed her parents, Jim and Naomi Olive, in the nearby suburban community of Terra Linda and then tried to dispose of the bodies by cremating them in a barbecue pit (firepit) at the park. In 2018, China Camp was used as a filming location for the popular Netflix drama, 13 Reasons Why.

He attended elementary school in Pyongyang, and then middle school at the Meiji Academy in Japan. In May 1919 he fled in exile to Shanghai where he was a reporter for the provisional government newspaper, The Independence (Dongnipsinmun). During this time he encountered An Changho and Lee Gwangsu. While in exile in Shanghai he entered Hujiang University to study Chemistry. He graduated from Hogang College in Shanghai in 1925. He was the editor of The Creation, famously the first literary magazine in Korea and was one of the leading figures of the New Poetry movement. In 1979, the South Korean government conferred on him posthumously honors of Rose of Sharon.\\"ÍπÄÎçïÎ†®, Î∞úÍµ¥/ Ï£ºÏöî ÏπúÏùºÎ™ÖÎã® 120Î™Ö Ï§ë 34Î™Ö Ìï¥Î∞©ÌõÑ Ìõà¬∑Ìè¨Ïû•¬∑ÌëúÏ∞Ω ÏÑúÌõà - ÍπÄÏÑ±ÏàòÎäî 2Îì±Í∏â, Ïú†Í¥ÄÏàúÏùÄ 3Îì±Í∏â\\" „ÄäOhmynews„Äã (2005.8.31) Additionally, several hymns are composed by him, which contributed development church music of Korea. Works Chu was considered a representative poet of the 1920 and 30's and his work can be roughly divided into those poems composed before his exile in Shanghai and those written afterward. His earlier poems, written during his years in Japan, reflect the influence of modern Western and Japanese poetry. The influence of the French symbolist poet Paul Fort is especially evident in pieces such as ‚ÄúPlaying with Fire‚Äù (Bullori): in a limpid, clear style he sensitively registers the minutest of impressions and manages to lend them a sensual immediacy. Yohan‚Äôs work as a whole more or less reflects a gradual turning away from styles and forms influenced by Western poetry toward traditional Korean poetry. Like Kim Eok, he was a major figure in Korean Literature who pioneered the move away from Western imitation to his literary roots. He articulates the reasons for this shift of inspiration in his critical piece, ‚ÄúTo the One Who Would Write a Song‚Äù (Noraereul jieusillyeoneun iege), in which he places the highest value on the creation of beauty and vitality in the Korean language and move on to develop a complete theory of poetry. After 1930, Yohan concentrated on writing sijo, a traditional Korean poetic form, but continued to produce other verse and edited, with others, the poetry anthology Poetry of Three People (Samin sigajip) and an anthology of sijo, Blind Flower (Bongsa kkot).

It is located 9 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the City of Canada Bay. Chiswick sits on the peninsula between Abbotsford Bay and Five Dock Bay, on the Parramatta River. It is surrounded by the suburbs of Abbotsford, Russell Lea and Drummoyne. History The area around Chiswick was first known by its Aboriginal name Bigi Bigi. The suburb was originally part of Five Dock Farm. In the 1850s a Dr Fortescue owned an estate in this area which he named Chiswick after the village on the Thames, west of London. Parramatta River had been known as the 'Thames of the Antipodes' and other nearby suburbs were also named after Thames localities of Greenwich, Woolwich, Henley and Putney.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 61 From 1884 until 1998, there was a wiremill on the waterfront at Chiswick. More recently it has been subjected to an increase in the building of many modern apartment blocks, which has seen the population rise to around 2400. Demographics According to the 2011 census, there were 2,470 residents in Chiswick. The most common responses for ancestry in Chiswick were English 19.5%, Australian 16.3%, Italian 12.5%, Irish 8.7% and Chinese 6.8%. The median weekly household income in Chiswick was $2,068, significantly higher than the national median of $1,234. Transport and commercial area The Chiswick ferry wharf is used by Parramatta River ferry services. State Transit operate a terminus nearby, with buses running to Circular Quay either via Drummoyne and Victoria Road, or via Leichhardt and Parramatta Road. The bus terminus also has a route running to Campsie station via Burwood station. Chiswick has a small group of shops in Blackwall Point Road, close to the ferry wharf.

They may be pets or draft animals trained to achieve certain tasks, such as guide dogs, assistance dogs, draft horses or logging elephants. Most working animals are either service animals or draft animals. They may also be used for milking or herding. Some, at the end of their working lives, may also be used for meat or other products such as leather. The history of working animals may predate agriculture, with dogs used by our hunter-gatherer ancestors. Around the world, millions of animals work in relationship with their owners. Domesticated species are often bred for different uses and conditions, especially horses and working dogs. Working animals are usually raised on farms, though some are still captured from the wild, such as dolphins and some Asian elephants. Traditional farming methods using oxen People have found uses for a wide variety of abilities in animals, and even industrialized societies use many animals for work. People use the strength of horses, elephants, and oxen to pull carts and move logs. Law enforcement uses the keen sense of smell of dogs to search for drugs and explosives, and others use dogs to find game or search for missing or trapped people. People use various animals‚Äîcamels, donkeys, horses, dogs, etc.‚Äîfor transport, either for riding or to pull wagons and sleds. Other animals, including dogs and monkeys, help blind or disabled people. On rare occasions, wild animals are not only tamed, but trained to perform work‚Äîthough often solely for novelty or entertainment, as such animals tend to lack the trustworthiness and mild temper of true domesticated working animals. Conversely, not all domesticated animals are working animals. For example, while cats may catch mice, it is an instinctive behavior, not one that can be trained by human intervention. Other domesticated animals, such as sheep or rabbits, may have agricultural uses for meat, hides and wool, but are not suitable for work. Finally, small domestic pets, such as most small birds (other than certain types of pigeon) are generally incapable of performing work other than providing companionship. Roles and specializationsTransportation= The horse-drawn winch of a former limestone quarry (France) Some animals are used due to sheer physical strength in tasks such as ploughing or logging. Such animals are grouped as a draught or draft animals. Others may be used as pack animals, for animal-powered transport, the movement of people and goods. Together, these are sometimes called beasts of burden. Some animals are ridden by people on their backs and are known as mounts; Alternatively, one or more animals in harness may be used to pull vehicles. Riding animals or mounts They mainly include equines such as horses, donkeys, and mules; bovines such as cattle, water buffalo, and yak. In some places, elephants, reindeers and camels are also used. Dromedary camels are in arid areas of Australia, North Africa and the Middle East; the less common Bactrian camel inhabits central and East Asia; both are used as working animals. On occasion, reindeer, though usually driven, may be ridden. Certain wild animals have been tamed and used for riding, usually for novelty purposes, including the zebra and the ostrich. Some mythical creatures are believed to act as divine mounts, such as garuda in Hinduism and the winged horse Pegasus in Greek mythology. Pack animals A pack llama Pack animals may be of the same species as mounts or harness animals, though animals such as horses, mules, donkeys, reindeer and both types of camel may have individual bloodlines or breeds that have been selectively bred for packing. Additional species are only used to carry loads, including llamas in the Andes. Domesticated cattle and yaks are also used as pack animals. Other species used to carry cargo include dogs and pack goats. Draft animals Donkey used to pull a wheeled vehicle in Morocco Camel pulling a coach in Rajasthan An intermediate use is as draft animals, harnessed singly or in teams, to pull sleds, wheeled vehicles or ploughs. *Oxen are slow but strong, and have been used in a yoke since ancient times: the earliest surviving vehicle, Puabi's Sumerian sledge, was ox-drawn; an acre was originally defined as the area a span of oxen could plow in a day. The water buffalo and carabao, domesticated water buffalo, pull wagons and ploughs in Southeast Asia and the Philippines. *Draught or draft horses are commonly used in harness for heavy work. Several breeds of medium-weight horses are used to pull lighter wheeled carts, carriages and buggies when a certain amount of speed or style is desirable. * Mules are considered tough and strong, with harness capacity dependent on the type of horse mare used to produce the mule foal. Because they are a hybrid animal and usually are infertile, separate breeding programs must also be maintained. *Ponies and donkeys are often used to pull carts and small wagons. Historically, ponies were commonly used in mining to pull ore carts. *Dogs are used for pulling light carts or, particularly, sleds (e.g. sled dogs such as huskies) for both recreation and working purposes. *Goats also can perform light harness work in front of carts *Reindeer are used in the Arctic and sub-Arctic Nordic countries and Siberia. During World War II, the Red Army deployed deer transportation battalions on the Eastern Front. In the twenty-first century, Russian soldiers continue to train with reindeer sleds in winter. In traditional festive legend, Santa Claus's reindeer pull a sleigh through the night sky to help Santa Claus deliver gifts to children on Christmas Eve. *Elephants are still used for logging in Southeast Asia. *Less often, camels and llamas have been trained to harness. According to Juan Ignacio Molina the Dutch captain Joris van Spilbergen observed the use of chiliquenes (a llama type) by native Mapuches of Mocha Island as plough animals in 1614.The Geographical, Natural and Civil History of Chili, Pages 15 and 16, Volume II Assorted wild animals have, on occasion, been tamed and trained to harness, including zebras and even moose. =Guard animals= As some domesticated animals display extremely protective or territorial behaviour, certain breeds and species can be utilised to guard property, including dogs, geese and llamas. =Powering fixed machinery= An ox-powered Copra press Working draught animals may power fixed machinery using a treadmill and have been used throughout history to power a winch to raise water from a well. Turnspit dogs were formerly used to power roasting jacks for roasting meat. =Treatment Animals= Working as a form of biological treatment for the environment. Animals such as Asian carps were imported to the U.S. in 1970s to control algae, weed, and parasite growth in aquatic farms, weeds in canal systems, and as one form of sewage treatment. =Searching and retrieving=Hunting A dog working as a retriever As predatory species are naturally equipped to catch prey, this is a further use for animals and birds. This can be done either for sustenance, sport, or to reduce the population of undesired animals that are considered harmful to crops, livestock or the environment. * Hounds and other dogs are used to kill and fetch prey. Certain breeds have been bred for this task such as pointers and setters. * Mousers (domestic cats used for hunting small rodents and birds) are one of the oldest working animals having protected food supplies from pests since the foundation of human agriculture. * Caracals are sometimes used as hunting animals in some parts of the Middle East, although they are normally kept as pets. * Cheetahs that have been tamed but not domesticated have been used by humans for chasing down prey. * Ferrets prey on creatures living in burrows, such as rabbits. * In falconry, birds of prey are used as hunters in the air. * Aquatic birds, such as cormorants in China, can be used to catch fish. Humans *Search and rescue dogs, with their highly developed sense of smell, are used to locate humans, such as escaped prisoners, a thief or people lost in remote areas. They are used also to find people who are trapped, such as in avalanches or collapsed buildings. * Dogs can also be used to look for dead people. *Searchers use horses in remote areas to cover large areas of rugged terrain. The horse's natural awareness of their surroundings often alerts human handlers to the presence of something unusual, including lost hikers or hunters. Like some dogs, some horses are trained to follow scent. The use of horses in search and rescue is known as Mounted search and rescue. Foods *Dogs and pigs, with a better sense of smell than humans, can assist with gathering by finding valuable products, such as truffles (a very expensive subterranean fungus). Frenchmen typically use truffle hogs, while Italians mainly use dogs. *Monkeys are trained to pick coconuts from palm trees, a job many human workers consider as too dangerous. Contraband *Detection dogs, commonly employed by law enforcement authorities, are trained to use their senses to detect illegal drugs, explosives, currency, and contraband electronics such as illicit mobile phones, among other things. The sense most used by detection dogs is smell, hence such dogs are also commonly known as 'sniffer dogs'. =Interfacing and organization=Assistance animals *The best-known example is the guide dog or seeing eye dog for blind people. See also service dog. Miniature horses are also occasionally used for this purpose as well. *Trained dogs and African, Asian, and American monkeys, such as capuchin monkeys have been taught to provide other functions for impaired people, such as opening mail and minor household tasks of the same like. Herding A Koolie dog working with sheep *A very close working relationship exists between a stockman or shepherd, a herding dog, and the herd (or mob) of sheep or cattle. Cattle and sheep herders in other parts of the world also use various dog breeds. *Certain breeds of horses also have an innate \\"cow sense\\" that allows them to effectively carry a rider to the right place at the right time to muster (gather or round up) livestock. See stock horse; cutting horse EmployersPolice and military= The defensive and offensive capabilities of animals (such as fangs and claws) can be used to protect or to attack humans. * The guard dog barks or attacks, to warn of an intruder * War elephants were trained for battle in ancient times and are still used for military transport today. *Military uses of horses have changed over the millennia but still continue, including for police work. * Dolphins and sea lions carry markers to attach to mines as well as patrolling harbors. * On land, dogs can be trained to find landmines. Rats, which are lighter and less of a risk to set the mines off, have recently been used more frequently.Bees, Giant African Rats Used to Sniff Landmines. In National Geographic, 10 February 2004.

Legal status In some jurisdictions, certain working animals are afforded greater legal rights than other animals. One such common example is police dogs, which are often afforded additional protections and the same memorial services as human officers. India law have provision for the in loco parentis for implementing animal welfare laws. Under the India law the non-human entities such as animals, deities, trusts, charitable organizations, corporate, managing bodies, etc. and several other non-human entitles have been given the status of the \\"legal person\\" with legal rights and duties, such as to sue and be sued, to own and transfer the property, to pay taxes, etc. In court cases regarding animals, the animals have the status of \\"legal person\\" and humans have the legal duty to act as \\"loco parentis\\" towards animals welfare like a parent has towards the minor children. In a case of cow- smuggling, the Punjab and Haryana High Court mandated that \\"entire animal kingdom including avian and aquatic\\" species has a \\"distinct legal persona with corresponding rights, duties, and liabilities of a living person\\" and humans are \\"loco parentis\\" while laying out the norms for animal welfare, veterinary treatment, fodder and shelter, e.g. animal drawn carriages must not have more than four humans, and load carrying animals must not be loaded beyond the specified limits and those limits must be halved when animals have to carry the load up a slope. A court while deciding the \\"Animal Welfare Board of India vs Nagaraja\\" case in 2014 mandated that animals are also entitled to the fundamental right to freedom enshrined in the Article 21 of Constitution of India i.e. right to life, personal liberty and the right to die with dignity (passive euthanasia). In another case, a court in Uttarakhand state mandated that animals have the same rights as humans.Birds to holy rivers: A list of everything India considers ‚Äúlegal persons‚Äù, Quartz (publication), September 2019.

Construction Floating bridge/pontoon bridge construction has a long history in military and civilian applications on every continent except Antarctica. According to the engineers who designed this bridge, it was designed using recent American technology for floating bridges, combined with Norwegian technology for offshore platforms. The bridge designers researched other bridges in the world and traveled to the state of Washington in the United States to visit the Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge and the Hood Canal Bridge--two floating bridges. The continuous floating concrete structure used in the Washington bridges was ultimately ruled out in favor of the discrete floating concrete pier design. This design afforded: 1) an elevated roadway that reduced traffic hazards in storms, 2) a reduction in corrosion of the bridge deck, and 3) improved passage of water beneath the bridge thereby supporting native species.

Early life Robert Hingley was born in Weymouth, Dorset in the United Kingdom in 1955. His family relocated regularly due to his father's career in the British Army and as such Hingley spent much of his early life abroad living in Germany, Cyprus, Kenya, Singapore and France. His roots are largely in Devonshire, hailing from a long line of Huxtables on his mother's side. His great grandfather, Charles, was one of the last of the great Appledore shipwrights. Charlie Huxtable's brother Richard was technical advisor to the clinker-built replicas of the Golden Hind (Sir Francis Drake) and the Mayflower. His great great uncle, Captain Oates, was a member of the ill-fated Scott 1912 expedition to the South Pole. Education Due to his father's military commitments Hingley attended Drake's Mead boarding school and Tavistock Comprehensive in the United Kingdom before entering the University of York in 1974. He graduated with an honours degree in Linguistics from the universities of York and Strasbourg (France) in 1978 speaking six languages Music career Hingley emigrated to the United States in the late 1970s to manage the Forbidden Planet comic shop in New York City before forming The Toasters in 1981. After failing to convince American labels on the viability of ska music in terms of a domestic record deal, he founded Moon Ska Records, an independent ska record label, in 1983. The label went on to become the benchmark of the genre for fifteen years before folding in 2000. The label pressed more than 1,500,000 copies of releases by many notable ska bands. In 2003 he founded Megalith Records. Hingley continues to tour and record with The Toasters, and is the only original member of the group. Aside from being active in The Toasters and Megalith Records, he also runs Cubo Consulting, a consulting business to the entertainment industry which specializes in tour production and resourcing. The business predominantly deals with American bands in Europe but also handles clients such as the John Lennon Foundation. Hingley lives in Valencia, Spain with his wife and daughters. Rob's son attended the University of Kent in the United Kingdom. Hingley uses a Fender Telecaster, a Reverend Eastsider T, and a Reverend Club King 290. In the early days of The Toasters, Hingley also used a Fender Stratocaster. Hingley uses a Fender Twin Reverb as his primary amp.

He founded the Socialist Party of Uruguay (PS) in 1910 and was its first general secretary, as well as its first representative in the Chamber of Deputies. LifeEarly activism= Born in Montevideo as one of the four children of Don Domingo Frugoni and Do√±a Josefina Queirolo, Emilio Frugoni joined Jos√© Batlle y Ord√≥√±ez's camp during the political fighting in 1904, and rose to the rank of Lieutenant. Upon the end of the conflict, he decided to, in his own words: :\\"never again get involved in the bloody rivalry [between the Colorado Party and the Blanco Party] (...) in order to open a new road for the political opinions of our people, to distance it from the archaic customs of blanco and colorado traditionalism (...).\\" In December 1904, Frugoni wrote his Profesi√≥n de fe socialista (\\"Socialist Testimonial\\") - which was partly published in the newspaper El D√≠a. This was the start of a process leading to the creation of the PS. A while after that, he commented in his El Socialismo no es la violencia, ni el despojo, ni el reparto (\\"Socialism Is Not Violence, Nor Plunder, Nor Redistribution\\"): :\\"The Socialist Party, which is revolutionary in its goals, is not insurrectional in its means, and does not aim to launch proletarians in a sterile struggle, nor does it seek to place all political power in the hands of the working class before it has worked within peaceful norms allowed by the development of its organisation and civic capacity, by the possibility to support itself in the conscious will of the nation (...) we will combat the bourgeois order, the social order, the economical and juridical ones that base themselves on the class inequalities and consecrate them, but we will not alter the \\"public order\\" by placing ourselves on the border of legality (...) we will not hold a subversive position in front of our constitutional order.\\" =Opposition to dictatorships= In 1920, he demanded a Party agreement on its position towards the October Revolution and Bolshevism. In the 1921 Congress, the PS voted to join the Comintern, and turned itself into the Communist Party of Uruguay (PCU); Frugoni refused to adhere to the party line, and refounded the PS as a non-communist group. In the 1928 elections, the PCU obtained 3,911 votes, and the PS 2,931. He became an opponent of authoritarian President Gabriel Terra in the 1930s, and was imprisoned, then exiled. Elected deputy in 1934, he had opposed the dictatorship enforced by the legislature, and, upon the swearing in of Terra, declared: :\\"The oath is worthless, as Dr. Terra has shown he does not carry out his promises.\\" He walked out of the Parliament to the PS headquarters as the former was stormed by police forces. In 1942, Frugoni was named Uruguay's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Soviet Union by President Juan Jos√© de Am√©zaga. He resigned his position in 1946 and returned to Montevideo, as he had become a harsh critic of Soviet policies. In La Esfinge Roja (1948), the book containing his experiences, he wrote: :\\"The fate of the Soviet citizen, and most of all his individual destiny, is suffering a suffocation through the criterion with which the nation is being driven and governed, in the canons of a narrow pseudo-collectivist fanaticism which places its focus only on masses and constantly dismisses the individual (...).\\" =Movimiento Socialista= In January 1963, he left the PS over internal disagreements, and created Movimiento Socialista, with which he ran in the elections of 1966. In 1966, he authored an Open Letter to the Socialists; among other things, it stated that \\"an electoral campaign is nowadays an economical adventure\\", and showed Frugoni's willingness to contribute his personal wealth. When the government of Jorge Pacheco Areco outlawed the PS and closed down El Sol and the PS headquarters (La Casa del Pueblo), Frugoni rejected the possibility that the patrimony could pass to the Movimiento Socialista. After his death, the Movimiento Socialista entered a tight alliance with the PS; nowadays, Frugoni's political thought is integrated in the party line of the PS.

Tapanim√§ki wrote his games for the Commodore 64 computer, and many have been ported to other computer systems. Tapanim√§ki was a reviewer for MikroBitti and \\"C\\" computer magazines; and a freelance writer of advanced-level computer programming articles. He also published a book called C-64 Pelintekij√§n Opas (or \\"C-64 Game Maker's Guide\\") in 1990. Career choice Tapanim√§ki was originally interested in a career as a graphic designer for advertisements. After failing the entrance exams to the University of Art and Design Helsinki twice, he instead started studying literature in 1984. In summer 1985, he purchased a Commodore 64 computer. Although he had no previous experience with computers, Tapanim√§ki decided to become a game programmer after a few months. He quit his studies and went on welfare to be able to concentrate on programming. Tapanim√§ki spent 1986 experimenting. One of his finished programs was named Aikaetsiv√§, a Finnish language text adventure in the style of Infocom, which the Tamperean retailer Triosoft bought publishing rights to but did not release. The first successfully operating game written by Tapanim√§ki was Monolith, announced in the June-July 1986 issue of MikroBITTI. It was followed by Minidium, a Uridium-style shoot 'em up published in the January 1987 issue of C Magazine. The development of Minidium was extensively covered in the magazine.Tapanim√§ki, Jukka: Minidium, overview, development details and full program listing. C-lehti 1/1987, pp. 52-56. Available online at . Early personal computer enthusiasts followed the development of Tapanim√§ki's career through his magazine articles. Commercial game successes Tapanim√§ki's first commercial game was Octapolis (1987, published by English Software). Octapolis is a mix of the platform and shoot-'em-up genres. Tapanim√§ki had created Octapolis completely by himself, except for the music. =Netherworld= The next year (1988) Tapanim√§ki had his game Netherworld published. The working title of the game was Abyss Zone. In it, the player has to pilot a spaceship through a series of caves while collecting diamonds. The game was published by Hewson, which used Tapanim√§ki's face as cover art (without first asking for his permission). The game's music was composed by Jori Olkkonen. =Zamzara= A screenshot of Zamzara That same year, Hewson published Zamzara on floppy disk for the Commodore 64. Zamzara is a single- player platform game where the player takes the role of an alien, whose mission is to escape a laboratory complex before a time bomb explodes. The bomb has a time limit of 15 minutes. Various enemies, both stationary and mobile, hinder the player's progress, requiring the player to shoot them in order to advance. The player character is armed with a gun and various additional weapons, which have a finite supply of ammunition. Many action game fans found Zamzara satisfying due to its various graphics styles. Some, however, complained about excessive difficulty. The music by Charles Deenen was generally praised. =Moonfall= In 1991, another game, Moonfall (inspired by Elite and Mercenary), using wireframe 3D graphics, was published. In the game the player steered a spaceship from the pilot's viewpoint. Because of agreements made with Hewson, the game could only be published two years after its completion, and was a commercial failure. The publisher was 21st Century Entertainment (Hewson's new name). Death Jukka Tapanim√§ki died 1 May 2000 due to heart failure caused by coronary heart disease.

The winner is the one closest to the average.  Equilibrium analysis  In this game there is no strictly dominant strategy. However, there is a unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium. This equilibrium can be found by iterated elimination of weakly dominated strategies. Guessing any number that lies above is weakly dominated for every player since it cannot possibly be of the average of any guess. These can be eliminated. Once these strategies are eliminated for every player, any guess above is weakly dominated for every player since no player will guess above , and of is . This process will continue until all numbers above 0 have been eliminated. All players selecting 0 also happens to be the Pareto optimal solution. This degeneration does not occur in quite the same way if choices are restricted to, for example, the integers between 0 and 100. In this case, all integers except 0 and 1 vanish; it becomes advantageous to select 0 if one expects that at least of all players will do so, and 1 otherwise. (In this way, it is a lopsided version of the so-called \\"consensus game\\", where one wins by being in the majority.)  Experimental results  This game is a common demonstration in game theory classes, where even economics graduate students fail to guess 0. When performed among ordinary people it is usually found that the winner's guess is much higher than 0: 21.6 was the winning value in a large online competition organized by the Danish newspaper Politiken. 19,196 people participated and the prize was 5000 Danish kroner. Includes a histogram of the guesses. Note that some of the players guessed close to 100. A large number of players guessed 33.3 (i.e. of 50), indicating an assumption that players would guess randomly. A smaller but significant number of players guessed 22.2 (i.e. of 33.3), indicating a second iteration of this theory based on an assumption that players would guess 33.3. The final number of 21.6 was slightly below this peak, implying that on average each player iterated their assumption 1.07 times.  Rationality versus common knowledge of rationality  This game illustrates the difference between perfect rationality of an actor and the common knowledge of rationality of all players. Even perfectly rational players playing in such a game should not guess 0 unless they know that the other players are rational as well and that all players' rationality is common knowledge. If a rational player reasonably believes that other players will not follow the chain of elimination described above, it would be rational for him/her to guess a number above 0. We can suppose that all the players are rational, but they do not have common knowledge of each other's rationality. Even in this case, it is not required that every player guess 0, since they may expect each other to behave irrationally.  History  Distribution of the 2898 answers to 1983 tie breaker Jeux et Strat√©gie contest. Alain Ledoux is the founding father of the guess of the average-game. In 1981, Ledoux used this game as a tie breaker in his French magazine Jeux et Strat√©gie. He asked about 4,000 readers, who reached the same number of points in previous puzzles, to state an integer between 1 and 1,000,000,000. The winner was the one who guessed closest to of the average guess. Rosemarie Nagel (1995) revealed the potential of guessing games of that kind: They are able to disclose participants' \\"depth of reasoning.\\" Due to the analogy to Keynes's comparison of newspaper beauty contests and stock market investments the guessing game is also known as the Keynesian beauty contest. Rosemarie Nagel's experimental beauty contest became a famous game in experimental economics. The forgotten inventor of this game was unearthed in 2009 during an online beauty contest experiment with chess players provided by the University of Kassel: Alain Ledoux, together with over 6,000 other chess players, participated in that experiment which looked familiar to him.

Webb has hundreds of film music credits to his name, mainly with RKO Pictures. He is best known for film noir and horror film scores, in particular for the films of Val Lewton. Biography Born in Manhattan, New York, Webb orchestrated and conducted for the Broadway stage, before moving to Hollywood in the late 1920s to work as music director for Radio Pictures, later RKO Pictures. He remained at RKO until 1955, then worked freelance for several years, including scoring several episodes of Wagon Train. Webb is credited as composer or arranger on more than 200 films, and received Academy Award nominations for Quality Street (1937), My Favorite Wife (1940), I Married a Witch (1942), Joan of Paris (1942), The Fallen Sparrow (1943), The Fighting Seabees (1944), and The Enchanted Cottage (1945). His piano concerto from The Enchanted Cottage was performed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Constantin Bakaleinikoff, in concert at the Hollywood Bowl in 1945. In 1961, a house fire destroyed Webb's manuscripts including film scores and unpublished concert music, after which Webb ceased composing. Webb died in 1982 from a heart attack at the age of 94. An alumnus of Columbia University, Webb wrote the fight song \\"Roar, Lion, Roar\\" for his alma mater in 1925. Several cues composed by Webb were used in the newsreel montage of Kane's life in Citizen Kane. Several cues composed by Webb replaced those by Bernard Herrmann in The Magnificent Ambersons after the film was re- edited.

According to Herodotus, however, the first king was Perdiccas I. Caranus is first reported by TheopompusTheopompus the Historian, Page 270 By Gordon Spencer Shrimpton and is the mythical founder of the Argead dynasty.Peter Green, Alexander of Macedon, 356‚Äì323 B.C.: A Historical Biography, University of California Press, 2013, p.103According to Pausanias (Description of Greece, 9.40, 8-9), Caranus set up a trophy after the Argive fashion for a victory against Cisseus: \\"The Macedonians say that Caranus, king of Macedonia, overcame a chieftain in a bordering country in the battle of Cisseus. For his victory Caranus set up a trophy after the Argive fashion, but it is said to have been upset by a lion from Olympus, which then vanished. Caranus realized that it was a mistaken policy to incur the undying hatred of the non-Greeks dwelling around, and so the rule was adopted that no king of Macedonia, neither Caranus himself nor any of his successors, should set up trophies, if they were ever to gain the good-will of their neighbors. This story is confirmed by the fact that Alexander set up no trophies, neither for his victory over Dareius nor for those he won in India.\\" Caranus' way is labeled by the blue colour  Myth  According to a Greek myth, Caranus was the son of Temenus, king of Argos, who in turn was a Heraclid, a descendant of Heracles. Plutarch agrees on the Heraclid lineage of Caranus and argues that Alexander the Great is a descendant of Heracles through Caranus.Plutarch, Alexander, 2.1 Temenus, along with Cresphontes and Aristodemus were the three Doric leaders who invaded the Mycenean Peloponnese region. Then they proceeded to divide the conquered territories between them. Cresphontes was given Messenia and Sparta; Aristodemus took Laconia; and finally Temenus was given Argos. Following the death of Temenus, the princes argued about who should be king. One of them, Pheidon, defeated his brothers in battle and took over the kingship. Caranus then decided to find another kingdom of his own, where he could be king. First, however he went to the Oracle of Delphi to ask Pythia's advice. \\"You should find your kingdom there, where you will find plenty of game and domestic animals, she advised.\\" Thus Caranus and his entourage moved to the North, in search of suitable land to establish his new kingdom. Finally, he discovered a green valley, with a lot of game and goats, whereupon he thought that the prophecy of Pythia had been fulfilled. Thus he built a city there, which he named Aigai (), present day Vergina, a site of substantial archaeological activity, as numerous important findings have been unearthed.

It can grow up to long, and feeds on insects. It is brown, grey and white. The species has five subspecies. Taxonomy The brown thornbill is a member of the order Passeriformes, the family Acanthizidae, and the genus Acanthiza. It also has five subspecies: Acanthiza pusilla pusilla, A. p. diemenensis, A. p. zietzi, A. p. archibaldi, and A. p. dawsonensis. The species was first described by George Shaw in 1790. The nominate subspecies A. p. pusilla was described by Shaw in 1790 and the subspecies A. p. diemenensis was first described by John Gould in 1838. A. p. zietzi was described by Alfred John North in 1904, A. p. dawsonensis was described by Archibald George Campbell in 1922, and A. p. archibaldi was described by Gregory Mathews in 1910. The generic name Acanthiza derives from Ancient Greek akanthe≈çn 'thorn-brake' and za≈ç 'to live, inhabit'. The specific epithet derives from Latin pusillus 'very small'. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the ancestor of the brown thornbill diverged from that of the mountain thornbill around 2 million years ago. Description The brown thornbill is warm brown to olive-brown above, with flanks of olive-buff to yellowish white. It has buff scallops on the forehead and large dark red eyes. There are blackish streaks on a grey throat and breast, a tawny rump and tail base, and a black subterminal band with paler tips on the tail.Pizzey, G. and F. Knight, The Field Guide to the Birds of Australia. 9 ed. 2012, Sydney: Harper Collins. 608 The brown thornbill ranges in size from , making it relatively small. It typically weighs . Distribution and habitat The brown thornbill can be found in the eastern and southeastern parts of Australia, including Tasmania. It is usually found within of the coast. It shares a substantial part of its range with the inland thornbill on the western slopes of the Great Dividing Range and the Mt Lofty Ranges. It is also common in the Blue Mountains. The subspecies A. p. pusilla and A. p. diemenensis have been observed near the Australian Capital Territory and on Tasmania, respectively. Brown thornbills live at elevations up to . They are found in dry forests with dense undergrowth, rainforests, shrublands, coastal dune thickets, and in rushes and bracken along rivers and creeks.Morcombe, Michael (2012) Field Guide to Australian Birds. Pascal Press, Glebe, NSW. Revised edition. They are sedentary and common, except in the drier parts of their range. Behaviour \\"Tiny birds cry wolf to scare predators\\" from the Australian National University =Vocalization= Brown thornbills are skilled mimics and also respond to humans imitating their calls. The calls have been described as \\"rich, musical warble\\". Their calls vary from a mellow baritone \\"pee-orr\\", high whistles with rapid cascading trills, to many squeaks and churrs. Adult brown thornbills are able to mimic the alarm calls of other birds such as the New Holland honeyeater that warn of a raptor approaching, which deters other predators such as pied currawongs from attacking their nests. =Feeding= The brown thornbill is mainly an insectivore, including spiders, beetles, lerp insects, ants and grasshoppers in its diet. However, it may sometimes eat seeds, fruit, or nectar.Gregory, P. (2020). \\"Brown Thornbill (Acanthiza pusilla), version 1.0.\\" In Birds of the World (J. del Hoyo, A. Elliott, J. Sargatal, D. A. Christie, and E. de Juana, Editors). Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA. It feeds restlessly close to the ground, in lower trees and shrubs of the understory. It often feeds in groups with other thornbills, except during the breeding season. It also forms mixed-species feeding flocks with the yellow-rumped thornbill (Acanthiza chrysorrhoa), the white-browed scrubwren (Sericornis frontalis), the speckled warbler (Pyrrholaemus sagittatus), and the eastern yellow robin (Eopsaltria australis). =Breeding= Brown thornbill couples tend to pair for a long time. Their nests are dome-shaped with a hooded side-entrance and built out of grasses, bark shreds, moss and feathers or plant down, lightly bound with spider webs, and usually set low in the undergrowth among ferns or tussocks. A clutch consists of two to four s, with three eggs being the most common. The eggs, measuring , are whitish with red-brown freckles towards the larger rounded end. They incubate for 19 days and have a nesting period of 16 days. Their breeding season extends from July to January. Conservation The brown thornbill is widespread with a stable population and classified as least concern on the IUCN Red List. The King Island brown thornbill (A. p. archibaldi) is considered to be critically endangered and most likely to go extinct, with very few sightings for many decades. However, recent surveys indicate that there may be between 20 and 50 individuals of the subspecies living on the island and consequently a recovery program was expected to be formulated in late 2019.

He was one of the first to take an interest in comparative anatomy, palaeontology, and the facial angle. He was among the first to mark out an \\"anthropology,\\" which he distinguished from natural history.Alan J. Barnard, Review Essay: \\"Anthropology, Race, and Englishness: Changing Notions of Complexion and Character,\\" Eighteenth Century Life 25 (2002): 94-102. He studied the orangutan, the javan rhinoceros, and the skull of a mosasaur, which he believed was a whale. Camper was a celebrity in Europe and became a member of the Royal Society (1750), the G√∂ttingen (1779), and Russian Academy of Sciences (1778), the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1783), the French (1786) and the Prussian Academy of Sciences (1788). He designed and constructed tools for his patients, and for surgeries. He was amateur-drawer, a sculptor, a patron of art and a conservative, royalist politician. Camper published some lectures containing an account of his craniometrical methods. These laid the foundation of all subsequent work.  Studies and teaching  The Academia van Vrieslant in Franeker Petrus Camper was the son of a well-to-do minister, who made his fortune Batavia, Dutch East Indies and returned with a (young?) pickled Bornean orangutan in a jar.http://repository.naturalis.nl/document/149431 A brilliant alumnus, he studied medicine and philosophy at the University of Leiden and obtained a degree in both sciences on the same day at the age of 24.His professors included Pieter van Musschenbroek and Willem Jacob 's Gravesande for physics and mathematics, Herman Boerhaave and Hieronymus David Gaubius for medicine, and Fran√ßois Hemsterhuis for philosophy. After both his parents died Camper travelled to England (where he met with William Smellie), to France (where he met with Georges de Buffon) and Geneva. In the meantime he was appointed as professor of philosophy, anatomy and surgery at the University of Franeker and Camper traveled to Friesland. In 1756, Camper married the widow Johanna Boerboom, daughter of the burgomaster of Leeuwarden, whom he met while treating her husband, the burgomaster from Harlingen.Frisian Society. Notes on Petrus Camper's period in Friesland, by P.C.J.A. Boeles Surgeon's Guild Waag and later in the Athenaeum Illustre of Amsterdam The Indian Elephants Hans and Parki Belonging to the menagerie of Stadholder Willem V In 1755 he had moved to Amsterdam, where he occupied a chair of anatomy and surgery at the Athenaeum Illustre, later completed by a medicine chair. He investigated inguinal hernia, patella and the best form of shoe. He withdrew five years later to dedicate himself to scientific research, living on his wife's estate \\"Klein Lankum\\" just outside Franeker. In his farewell speech, he mentioned that he had dissected more than 50 bodies in public, including a twelve-year- old Angolese black boy.'Petrus Camper On the Origin and Color of Blacks by Miriam Claude Meijer His experience led to the publication of Demonstrationum anatomico-pathologicarum (1760-1762). In 1762 he became politically active and promoted public health issues such as vaccination against smallpox.DBNL on Camper In 1763 he accepted the chair of anatomy, surgery and botany at the University of Groningen.Studying in Groningen Through the Ages: A History of the University of Groningen and the First English Department in the Netherlands. Groningen: Groningen University Press, 2014, p. 87-88. He made drawings to illustrate his eloquent lectures and the number of students grew. His main focus of attention was anatomy, zoology and his collection of minerals and fossils. Among his many works, he studied osteology of birds and discovered the presence of air in the inner cavities of birds' skeletons. He investigated the anatomy of eight young orangutans, establishing it as a different species to humans, as quadrupeds, against the theories of contemporary scientists.Het rusteloze bestaan van dokter Petrus Camper) (1722-1789) by Jan Klaas Korst, p. 168 \\"Camper cleared up a lot of confusion when he distinguished the orangutan from the chimpanzee.\\"Race and Aesthetics in the Anthropology of Petrus Camper (1722-1789) von Miriam Claude Meijer, p. 138 Petrus Camper published treatises on the hearing of fishes and the sound of frogs. He studied the diseases of rinderpest and rabies (1768-1770). Camper kept a surgical clinic. Before retiring in 1773, he introduced several new instruments and procedures for surgery and obstetrics. Back in Franeker, he dissected an elephant and a Javan rhinoceros, after they died in the menagerie, belonging to the stadtholder. In 1782 he published his latest research, a treatise in which he disagreed with Carl Linnaeus and De Buffon on the taxonomy of apes.Verkruyse, P. et al (2007), Aap, vis, boek. Linnaeus in de Artis Bibliotheek, p. 29. * In 1778 he was visited by Samuel Thomas von S√∂mmering, who later became a professor in G√∂ttingen. Camper was in contact with Johann Friedrich Blumenbach and Johann Heinrich Merck. * In 1780 he travelled in the company of his son to Wolfenb√ºttel and met with Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. In Potsdam, he was received by Frederick the Great, introduced by Henri de Catt. In Berlin he met with Moses Mendelsohn and Samuel Formey. * In 1781 he traveled to Hamburg and met with Prince Henry and Charlotte Sophie of Aldenburg; in 1782 Camper visited the Duke Louis Ernest of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. * In November 1783 he was a Foreign Founding Member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.Former Fellows of The Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783 ‚Äì 2002 * In 1783 he was appointed by the stadtholder as one of the burgomasters of Workum and in 1784 became one of the directors of the Admiralty of Friesland. Camper was an Orangist, opposing the patriots. * In 1785 he visited Edmund Burke. * In September 1787 he became the president of the state council of the Dutch Republic and warmly welcomed the return of the stadtholder William V of Orange and his wife Wilhelmine of Prussia in the Hague. *At the end of life he suffered from pleuritis; Camper had a Burgundian lifestyle, drank a good glass of champagne and died.  Comparative anatomy  Camper was interested in the classification of all sorts of fossil discoveries, such as the Mosasaurus in Maastricht, which he inspected and drew in the 1770s. His drawings were later published by Barth√©lemy Faujas de Saint- Fond One of the first to study comparative anatomy, Petrus Camper demonstrated the principle of correlation in all organisms by \\"metamorphosis\\". In his 1778 lecture, \\"On the Points of Similarity between the Human Species, Quadrupeds, Birds, and Fish; with Rules for Drawing, founded on this Similarity,\\" he metamorphosed a horse into a human being, thus showing the similarity between all vertebrates. √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire theorised this in 1795 as the \\"unity of organic composition,\\" the influence of which is perceptible in all his subsequent writings; nature, he observed, presents us with only one plan of construction, the same in principle, but varied in its accessory parts. Camper's metamorphoses which demonstrated this \\"unity of Plan\\" greatly impressed Diderot and Goethe. In 1923 and 1939 some Dutch authors suggested that Camper foreshadowed Goethe's famous idea of \\"type\\" ‚Äì a common structural pattern in some mannerSee Miriam Claude Meijer, \\"Petrus Camper's Protean Performances: The Metamorphoses\\" (with a drawing of Camper's animated metamorphose) ‚Äì URL. Retrieved 28 February 2007 \\"Facial angle\\"  Picture of a human male based on Petrus Camper measurements Petrus Camper is renowned for his theory of facial angle (Prognathism). He determined that humans had facial angles between 70¬∞ and 80¬∞, with African and Asian angles closer to 70¬∞, and European angles closer to 80. According to his new portraiture technique, an angle is formed by drawing two lines: one horizontally from the nostril to the ear, and the other perpendicularly from the advancing part of the upper jawbone to the most prominent part of the forehead. He claimed that antique Greco-Roman statues presented an angle of 100¬∞-95¬∞, Europeans of 80¬∞, 'Orientals' of 70¬∞, Black people of 70¬∞ and the orangutan of 42‚Äì58¬∞. He stated that, out of all races, Africans were most removed from the classical sense of ideal beauty. These results were later used as scientific racism, with research continued by √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and Paul Broca. Camper, however, agreed with Buffon in drawing a sharp line between human and animals (although he was misinterpreted by Diderot, who claimed that he was a supporter of the Great Chain of Being theory).Ann Thomson, Issues at stake in eighteenth-century racial classification , Cromohs, 8 (2003): 1‚Äì20Links between the discovery of primates and anatomical comparisons with humans, the chain of being, our place in nature, and racism by Rui Diogo Camper confirmed the categorizing species by Linn√©.http://www.zobodat.at/pdf/Spixiana_006_0301-0332.pdf Camper and the arts He was interested in architecture, mathematics, furniture making, drawing and illustrated his own lectures. Four times he gave lectures in Amsterdam to art students, e.g. on beauty and portraiture. He disagreed that artists painted the black Magus (in the nativity) with a Caucasian face. In 1780 he took lessons from √âtienne Maurice Falconet. In his ideas about art, Camper was influenced by Johann Joachim Winckelmann. He made drawings of the Dolmen near Noordlaren. He was in the selection committee for the prize contest for the design of the new townhall in Groningen that was awarded to his friend Jacob Otten Husly.

This species is resident in Australia where numbers are believed to be in decline. A subspecies, the Abrolhos painted buttonquail (Turnix varius scintillans), is endemic to the Houtman Abrolhos islands. Taxonomy The painted buttonquail was first described by the English ornithologist John Latham in 1801 under the binomial name Perdix varia. Description The painted buttonquail is about long. It is a ground-dwelling bird and is found in grassy forests and woodlands. It feeds on insects and seeds, and the males incubate the eggs for a fortnight and then care for the young. The female is the more brightly coloured of the sexes. Her eyes are red, and her crown, face and breast are flecked with white. Her shoulders are chestnut with thin white streaking above them. The male is slightly smaller and duller in colour. Distribution The painted buttonquail is native to Australia. Its range extends from Queensland southwards to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. A separate population is present in the southwestern part of Western Australia. The subspecies Turnix varius scintillans is endemic to the Houtman Abrolhos islands off the west coast of Australia. Another subspecies, Turnix varius novaecaledoniae was endemic to New Caledonia but is believed to be extinct as it has not been recorded since 1912. The painted buttonquail became established on Rottnest Island around 2002. Status The painted buttonquail has a wide range. An estimate of the population size has not been made but numbers are suspected to be in decline. It is said to be common in suitable habitat in some areas and uncommon in others. The IUCN has listed it as being of \\"Least Concern\\".

It is a creeping evergreen perennial with glossy green, kidney shaped leaves and solitary dull purple flowers hidden by the leaves. Though its roots have a ginger aroma, it is not closely related to the true culinary ginger Zingiber officinale, which originates in tropical Asian rainforests. It is sometimes harvested for use as a spice or a flavoring. In former days, it was used in snuff and also medicinally as an emetic and cathartic. Description The prostrate stems are long, each bearing two reniform leaves with long petioles. The leaves are about 10 cm wide. The upper surface of the leaves is shiny, and they have a pepper-like taste and smell. There are also 2 to 3 stipules present that occur in two rows opposite each other on the stem. The flowers are solitary, terminal and nodding. The flower tube is composed of fused tepals that ends with 3 petal- like projections that are brownish towards their ends and dark purple toward the centre. There are 12 stamens present. The flowers emerge in the late winter and spring. Distribution and habitat Asarum europaeum has a wide distribution in Europe. It ranges from southern Finland and northern Russia south to southern France, Italy, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia and Bulgaria. It is absent from the British Isles and Scandinavia, and also from northwestern Germany and the Netherlands. Within Europe, the plant is grown outside of its range in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands. It occurs mostly in deciduous woodland or coniferous forests, especially in calcareous (chalky) soils. Subspecies There are two recognised subspecies other than the type, including A. europaeum ssp. caucasicum, which is confined to the southwestern Alps, and A. europaeum ssp. italicum, which is found in central and northern Italy as well as in the Skopska Crna Gora mountains of North Macedonia and Kosovo. Cultivation A. europaeum is quite shade-tolerant and is often employed as groundcover where little else will grow. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit.

The end of the bill of the royal spoonbill is broader and works more like a pair of tongs than the narrower bill of the yellow-billed spoonbill, which acts like a forceps. Feeding The royal spoonbill is carnivorous, catching small animals by sweeping its bill through shallow water and swallowing prey once detected. When slow sweeping, the spoonbill walks slowly with the bill perpendicular to the water surface (i.e. vertical) with the bill tip open about , sweeping an arc of around 100 degrees in front of the bird. The bird walks slowly, kicking up debris and small animals from the bottom of the body of water, which it senses and catches with its bill. When an item is sensed, the spoonbill switches to intensive sweeping of a small area. Royal spoonbills also probe submerged plants directly for prey, and seize prey such as spiders above ground. They have also been observed dragging their bills through shallow water alongside them while walking. Prey items recorded at Lake Cowal include freshwater crustaceans such as the common yabby (Cherax destructor), shrimp of the genus Macrobrachium and family Atyidae, insects, particularly aquatic bugs of the families Notonectidae and Corixidae, fish such as mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) and goldfish (Carassius auratus), and occasionally freshwater snails and plant material such as medic burr (Medicago polymorpha). Breeding When they are breeding, long white plumes grow from the back of their heads and coloured patches appear on the face. The nest is an open platform of sticks in a tree in which the female lays two or three eggs. The chicks hatch after 21 days. The birds are highly sensitive to disturbance in the breeding season. In Australia, whole colonies have been known to desert their eggs after a minor upset.

It is sometimes also referred to as Brassica alba or B. hirta. Grown for its seeds, used to make the condiment mustard, as fodder crop, or as a green manure, it is now widespread worldwide, although it probably originated in the Mediterranean region. Description White mustard is an annual, growing to 70 cm high with stalkless pinnate leaves, similar to Sinapis arvensis.Webb, D.A., Parnell, J. and Doogue, D. 1996. An Irish Flora. Dundalgan Press Ltd., Dundalk. Distribution Most common in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, it can be found worldwide.

Cambridge University Press. Culinary uses The yellow flowers of the plant produce hairy seed pods, with each pod containing roughly a half dozen seeds. These seeds are harvested just prior to the pods becoming ripe and bursting. White mustard seeds are hard round seeds, usually around in diameter, with a color ranging from beige or yellow to light brown. They can be used whole for pickling or toasted for use in dishes. When ground and mixed with other ingredients, a paste or more standard condiment can be produced. Sinapis alba is used to make the commonplace yellow table mustard, with additional yellow coloring provided by turmeric in some formulations. The seeds contain sinalbin, which is a thioglycoside responsible for their pungent taste. White mustard has fewer volatile oils and the flavor is considered to be milder than that produced by black mustard seeds. In Greece, the plant's leaves can be eaten during the winter, before it blooms. Greeks call it vrouves (Œ≤œÅŒøœçŒ≤Œ±) or lapsana (ŒªŒ±œàŒ¨ŒΩŒ±). The blooming season of this plant (February‚ÄìMarch) is celebrated with the Mustard Festival, a series of festivities in the wine country of California (Napa and Sonoma Counties). Other uses White mustard is commonly used as a cover and green manure crop in Europe (between UK and Ukraine). A large number of varieties exist, e.g. in Germany, Netherlands, mainly differing in lateness of flowering and resistance against white beet- cyst nematode (Heterodera schachtii). Farmers prefer late-flowering varieties, which do not produce seeds, as they may become weeds in the subsequent year. Early vigour is important to cover the soil quickly to suppress weeds and protect the soil against erosion. In rotations with sugar beets, suppression of the white beet-cyst nematode is an important trait. Resistant white mustard varieties reduce nematode populations by 70-90%.

He previously played for Super League clubs Wigan Warriors and Wakefield Trinity Wildcats (twice) (Heritage No. 1308), and Salford Red Devils, and in Australia for the Parramatta Eels and the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks of the National Rugby Leaguen the NRL. Smith's usual position was in the halves. Playing career Smith in 2005 Smith started his NRL career with the Parramatta Eels and received much acclaim from Parramatta legend Peter Sterling, who \\"handed over\\" the Eels number 7 jersey in an episode of The NRL Footy Show in the middle of 2005. Smith played 26 games in the 2005 NRL season as Parramatta won the Minor Premiership. Along with St. George Illawarra, Parramatta were favorites to win the premiership in 2005 but were defeated 29-0 in the preliminary final by North Queensland at Telstra Stadium in an upset loss. After leading the competition in try assists he won the rookie of the year award at the 2005 Dally M Awards. With 40 try assists in his d√©but season Smith was named the 2005 Parramatta Eels season's rookie of the year. As of the 2019 NRL season, Smith's 40 try assists is still an NRL record. In December 2005, Smith was allegedly involved in a street scuffle with a man in the inner-Sydney suburb of the Rocks. He denied any such action and no charges were laid. In 2006, Smith was involved in an altercation with Australian cricketer Michael Clarke after Clarke confronted Smith at the Northies Hotel in Cronulla. It was alleged that Smith was talking to Clarke's ex-girlfriend which led to the altercation.https://www.smh.com.au/sport/nrl/what-on-earth-is-going-on-in-the- head-of-tim-smith-20060624-gdntoa.html In the 2007 NRL season, Smith played 27 games for Parramatta as the club made it to the preliminary final but fell short of a grand final appearance losing to Melbourne 26-10. In December 2007, further allegations of public drunken behaviour were made against Smith. Smith was suspended indefinitely by Parramatta. He remained on contract with the club, and Parramatta stated the most important issue was his health. Smith booked himself into full-time rehabilitation interstate. On 8 January 2008 the Parramatta Club reviewed his behaviour at the rehabilitation clinic and lifted his suspension but he was subject to a number of sanctions which included a fine and charity work. Early in the 2008 season, after just three games of football, Smith advised his club and teammates that he was suffering from bipolar disorder. He then gave a statement to the media saying he had been given an indefinite leave from football, saying he was having trouble coping with the constant criticism from the media. Smith returned to his family in the Gold Coast, with the aim to rest and recuperate with the aim of returning to professional rugby league in the future.  Move to England  Wigan announced in June 2008 that they had signed Smith for the remainder of the 2008 season and 2009. Smith linked up with his new teammates in July once his work-permit has been approved, after weeks of visa complications. He played his professional d√©but for the club in a home loss to Huddersfield, although the mental illness that had ended his season for the Parramatta Eels and lack of match fitness did produce some concern about his ability to play rugby league in Europe's top-flight competition, which was reflected in the terms of his contract to Wigan, despite his claims that his bipolar condition was now under control: Smith showed some excellent form in the first half of the 2009 season, putting together successive man of the match performances, but a shoulder injury ended his season early and he returned to Australia. Rumours continued to revolve around Smith, with Cronulla looking the most likely home for the young, gifted playmaker. The star halfback declared he was hopeful of a return to the Eels and would take a $250,000 pay cut to make it happen.  Return to the NRL (2010)  He signed with the Brisbane Broncos for the 2010 NRL season but did not make an appearance, which led to his move to the Sharks. In late 2009, Smith began training with the Brisbane Broncos in a bid to win a return to the NRL through their Queensland Cup feeder side Easts Tigers. Months later, he signed with the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks. In his first match back in the NRL, he played his former club the Parramatta Eels, and was influential in leading the Sharks to an 11‚Äì0 win, scoring a penalty goal and a field goal. However Smith's form subsequently dropped, which resulted in his axing to the NSW Cup. Wakefield Trinity Smith signed with Wakefield Trinity for the 2012 season and made his first public appearance at the Trinity kit launch on 8 December. Salford Red Devils Smith signed with Salford Red Devils towards the end of the 2013 season, with the Chairman of his former club releasing a statement confirming that Salford had paid 'a substantial fee' for the half back. On 10 June, Smith returned to Wakefield on loan until the end of the season. However, on the same day, Salford owner Marwan Koukash had to ditch players to fit Kevin Locke in the team. Locke had a high salary, and Tim and teammate Shannan McPherson had to leave in order for Locke to fit under the Salary Cap and avoid breach. Wakefield Trinity In October 2014, Smith rejoined Wakefield on a one-year deal. On 1 October 2015, Smith was terminated by Wakefield for gross misconduct and for bringing the club into disrepute. It was alleged at the time that Smith along with teammate Kevin Locke had crashed his car into another vehicle and into the wall of a house. Smith attended Beverley magistrates court and was banned from driving for 28 months and fined ¬£900 after admitting failing to provide a specimen following the car crash in September 2015. The 30-year-old was also handed a ¬£600 fine for careless driving. Smith had been suspended by the club pending an investigation into the car crash but failed to attend a hearing after submitting a sick note citing anxiety. Wakefield chairman Michael Carter said to the media \\"A letter was last night sent to Tim Smith and his lawyer saying we were dismissing him for gross misconduct and bringing the club into disrepute.

That depth lies below the axis of the main duct of sound speed minimum. It is the point at which sound speed equals the maximum found above the axis in the surface layer. See SOFAR channel. This concept is useful for understanding the initiation of phytoplankton blooms. History Critical depth as an aspect of biological oceanography was introduced in 1935 by Gran and Braarud. It became prominent in 1953 when Harald Sverdrup published the \\"Critical Depth Hypothesis\\" based on observations he had made in the North Atlantic on the Weather Ship 'M'. Sverdrup provides a simple formula based on several assumptions that relates the Critical Depth to plankton growth and loss rates and light levels. Under his hypothesis, net production in the mixed layer exceeds losses only if the mixed layer is shallower than the Critical Depth. Unfortunately, his hypothesis has often been misconstrued to suggest that spring phytoplankton blooms are triggered when the mixed layer depth shoals to become shallower than the critical depth in the spring. In fact, this is not what Sverdrup intended. Since 1953, further investigation and research has been conducted to better define the critical depth and its role in initiating spring phytoplankton blooms. Recent analysis of satellite data suggest that the theory does not explain all spring blooms, particularly the North Atlantic spring bloom. Several papers have appeared recently that suggest a different relationship between the mixed layer depth and spring bloom timing. Definition Sverdrup defines the critical depth at which integrated photosynthesis equals integrated respiration. This can also be described as the depth at which the integral of net growth rate over the water column becomes zero. The net growth rate equals the gross photosynthetic rate minus loss terms. Gross photosynthesis exponentially decays from a maximum near the surface to approach zero with depth. It is affected by the amount and angle of solar radiation and the clarity of the water. The loss rate is the sum of cellular respiration, grazing, sinking, advection, viral lysis, and mortality. In his hypothesis, Sverdrup made the approximation that the loss rate for a phytoplankton community is constant at all depths and times. The depth where the net growth rate is zero is referred to as the compensation depth (only 0.1-1% of solar radiation penetrates). Above this depth the population is growing, while below it the population shrinks. At a certain depth below it, the total population losses equal the total population gains. This is the critical depth. Critical Depth HypothesisAssumptions= Sverdrup‚Äôs Critical Depth Hypothesis and model is built on several strict assumptions: * Turbulence in the thoroughly mixed top layer is strong enough to distribute the phytoplankton evenly throughout the mixed layer * Phytoplankton loss rate is independent of depth and of growth rate. * Nutrients in the mixed layer are high enough that production is not nutrient limited * Daily photosynthetic production of the phytoplankton community at any depth is proportional to the mean daily light energy at that depth. In other words, light is assumed to be the only factor that limits the growth of phytoplankton during pre-bloom months and the light a phytoplankton community is subject to is determined by the incident irradiance and the coefficient of light extinction. =Mechanism= Sverdrup‚Äôs research results suggested that the shoaling of the mixed layer depth to a depth above the critical depth was the cause of spring blooms. When the mixed layer depth exceeds the critical depth, mixing of the water brings so much of the phytoplankton population below the compensation depth where photosynthesis is impossible that the overall population cannot increase in biomass. However, when the mixed layer becomes shallower than the critical depth, enough of the phytoplankton remain above the compensation depth to give the community a positive net growth rate. Sverdrup‚Äôs model is a cause and effect relationship between the depth of the mixed layer versus the critical depth and the bloom of phytoplankton. This trigger occurs in the spring due to seasonal changes in the critical depth and mixed layer depth. The critical depth deepens in the spring because of the increased amount of solar radiation and the decrease in the angle it hits the earth. During the winter, strong winds and storms vigorously mix the water, leaving a thick mixed layer to bring up nutrient-rich waters from depth. As the average winds decrease from the winter storms and the ocean is heated, the vertical water column becomes increasingly stratified and the mixed layer depth decreases. Sverdrup‚Äôs Critical Depth Hypothesis is limited to explaining what initiates a spring bloom. It does not predict its magnitude. Additionally, it does not address any population controls after the initial bloom, such as nutrient limitation or predator-prey interaction with zooplankton. =Regional Applicability= Since 1953, scientists have examined the applicability of Sverdrup's Critical Depth (SCD hereafter) theory in different regions around the world. Semina (1960) found that SCD hypothesis does not apply well in the Bering Sea near Kamchatka, where the bloom is more limited by stability, nutrients, and grazing than by light. Obata et al.(1996) concluded that SCD theory works well at middle and high latitudes of the western North Pacific and the North Atlantic, but it is not able to explain how the spring bloom occurs in the eastern North Pacific and the Southern Ocean. Siegel et al. (2002) deduced that eastern North Atlantic Basin south of 40¬∞N is likely limited by nutrients rather than light and hence is another region where SCD hypothesis would not be well applied. Behrenfeld (2010) also reported that SCD doesn‚Äôt apply well in Subarctic Atlantic regions. Most research used hydrographically defined mixed layer depth, which is not a good proxy for turbulence-driven movement of the phytoplankton and hence might not properly test the applicability of SCD hypothesis, as argued in Franks (2014). The variable regional applicability of SCD has motivated researchers to find alternate biological and physical mechanisms for spring boom initiation in addition to the mechanism proposed by Sverdrup. Criticisms The main criticisms of Sverdrup's hypothesis result from its assumptions. One of the greatest limitations to understanding the cycle of spring phytoplankton blooms is the assumption that loss rates of phytoplankton in the vertical water column are constant. As more becomes known about phytoplankton loss rate components (such as grazing, respiration, and vertical export of sinking particles), Sverdrup‚Äôs hypothesis has come under increasing criticism. Smetacek and Passow published a paper in 1990 that challenged the model on the basis that phytoplankton cellular respiration is not constant, but is a function of growth rate, depth, and other factors. They claimed that net growth depended on irradiation, species physiology, grazing, and parasitic pressures in addition to mixed layer depth. They also point out that Sverdrup‚Äôs model included respiration of the entire community (including zooplankton) rather than solely photosynthetic organisms. Sverdrup himself offered criticism of his model when he stated that \\"a phytoplankton population may increase independently of the thickness of the mixed layer if the turbulence is moderate.\\" He also said that advection rather than local growth could be responsible for the bloom he observed, and that the first increase in plankton biomass occurred before the shoaling of the mixed layer, hinting to more complex processes initiating the spring bloom. Although Sverdrup pointed out that there is a difference between a uniform-density mixed layer and a turbulent layer, his theory is criticized for the lack of emphasis placed on how the intensity of turbulence could affect blooms. In 1999, using a numerical model, Huisman et al. formulated a \\"critical turbulence\\" hypothesis, based on the idea that spring blooms can occur even in deep mixed layers as long as turbulence stays below a critical value so that phytoplankton have enough time in the euphotic zone to absorb light. This hypothesis points to the difference between a mixed layer and an actively turbulent layer that could play a more important role. Current Considerations Despite criticism of Sverdrup's Critical Depth Hypothesis, it is still regularly cited due to unresolved questions surrounding the initiation of spring blooms. Since its introduction, Sverdrup‚Äôs hypothesis has provided a framework for future research, facilitating a wide range of studies that address its assumptions. With the advancement of interdisciplinary knowledge and technological capabilities, it has become easier to expand on Sverdrup‚Äôs basic theory for critical depth using methods that were not available at the time of its original publication. Many studies seek to address the shortcomings of the theory by using modern observational and modeling approaches to explain how various biological and physical processes affect the initiation of spring blooms in addition to critical depth. This has led to several theories describing its initiation mechanisms that add complexity to the original theory. Theories involving the role of physiological characteristics, grazing, nutrient availability, and upper ocean physics are active areas of research on spring blooms. =Dilution Recoupling Hypothesis= Michael Behrenfeld proposes the \\"Dilution Recoupling Hypothesis\\" to describe the occurrence of annual spring blooms. He emphasized that phytoplankton growth is balanced by losses, and the balance is controlled by seasonally varying physical processes. He argued that the occurrence of optimum growth conditions allows for both the growth of predator and prey, which results in increased interactions between the two; it recouples predator-prey interactions. He describes this relationship as being diluted (fewer interactions) in the winter, when the mixed layer is deep and stratification of the water column is minimal. Similar observations were described by Landry and Hassett (1982). The most prominent evidence supporting Behrenfeld's hypothesis is that phytoplankton blooms occur before optimal growth conditions as predicted by mixed depth shoaling, when the phytoplankton concentrations are more diluted. As stratification is established and the biomass of zooplankton increases, grazing increases and the phytoplankton biomass declines over time. Behrenfeld‚Äôs research also modeled respiration as being inversely proportional to phytoplankton growth (as growth rate decreases, respiration rate increases). Behrenfeld‚Äôs model proposes the opposite relationship of phytoplankton growth rate to mixed layer depth than Sverdrup‚Äôs: that it is maximized when the layer is deepest and phytoplankton most diluted. =Critical Turbulence Hypothesis= Another shortcoming of Sverdrup's model was that he did not consider the role of active turbulence in the mixed layer. Upper ocean turbulence can result from many sources, including thermal convection, wind, waves, and Langmuir circulation. It mixes the upper layer by overturning fluid and particles, reducing the stratification in which spring blooms thrive. Huisman et al. (1999) proposed a critical turbulence mechanism in addition to critical depth that explains how spring blooms can be initiated even in the absence of surface-warming stratification. This mechanism relies on a critical turbulence level over which vertical mixing rate due to turbulence is higher than phytoplankton growth rate. When the atmospheric cooling becomes weak in the spring, turbulence subsides rapidly, but the mixed layer takes a longer time to react; restratification of the mixed layer occurs on timescales of weeks to months, while reduction of turbulence takes effect almost immediately after forcing stops (i.e. after atmospheric cooling shifts to warming). This could explain why the onset of the bloom can occur prior to the time when the mixed layer restratifies above the critical depth; reduced turbulence ceases overturning, allowing phytoplankton to have a longer residence time in the photic zone to bloom. This theory has been explored by Taylor & Ferrari (2011) using 3D Large eddy simulation (LES) turbulence modeling to study how the shutdown of thermal convection (i.e. convective overturning resulting from cooling of the ocean surface) can halt upper ocean turbulence and initiate a bloom before the mixed layer shoals to the critical depth. Unlike Huisman et al., they employed a vertically varying turbulent diffusivity in their model instead of a constant diffusivity, addressing whether the mixed layer is truly \\"thoroughly mixed\\" if temperature and density are vertically constant but turbulence intensity is not. Their findings were further supported in Ferrari et al. (2015) by remote sensing of chlorophyll using ocean color measurements from the NASA MODIS Aqua satellite and air-sea heat flux measurements from ECMWF re-analysis ERA-interim data to correlate high chlorophyll concentrations to changes in surface heat flux. Enriquez & Taylor (2015) took Taylor & Ferrari‚Äôs work a step further by using an LES model to compare the influence of thermal convective mixing to wind-induced mixing for spring bloom initiation. By assigning varying values for wind stress and surface heat flux, they were able to develop parameterizations for mixing depth and turbulent diffusivity using the LES model, and apply them to a phytoplankton model to monitor the response. They found that very little wind-induced turbulence is needed to prevent a bloom (consistent with Taylor & Ferrari) and that wind stress and heat flux interact such that the addition of surface heating (at the end of winter, for example) causes a sharp increase in the intensity of wind stress needed to prevent a bloom. This research has implications for the significance of different sources of turbulence in spring bloom inhibition. Brody & Lozier (2015) also support the idea that depth of active mixing in the mixed layer controls the timing of the spring bloom. Using Lagrangian floats and gliders, they were able to correlate reduced mixed layer turbulence to increased photosynthetic activity by comparing observational data of active mixing profiles to biomass depth profiles. =Onset of Stratification= Stephen Chiswell proposes the ‚ÄúOnset of Stratification Hypothesis‚Äù to describe both the annual cycle of primary production and the occurrence of annual spring blooms in temperate waters. Chiswell shows that the observations made by Behrenfeld can be interpreted in a way that adheres to the conventional idea that the spring bloom represents a change from a deep-mixed regime to a shallow light-driven regime. Chiswell shows that the Critical Depth Hypothesis is flawed because its basic assumption that phytoplankton are well mixed throughout the upper mixed layer is wrong. Instead, Chiswell suggests that plankton are well mixed throughout the upper mixed layer only in autumn and winter, but in spring shallow near- surface warm layers appear with the onset of stratification. These layers support the spring bloom. In his Stratification Onset Hypothesis, Chiswell discusses two hypothetical oceans. One ocean is similar to that discussed by Berenfeld, where total water column production can be positive in winter, but the second hypothetical ocean is one where net production in winter is negative. Chiswell thus suggests that the mechanisms of the Dilution Recoupling Hypothesis are incidental, rather than a cause of the spring bloom. = Physiological considerations = In addition to abiotic factors, recent studies have also examined the role of individual phytoplankton traits that may lead to the initiation of the spring bloom. Models have suggested that these variable, cell-specific parameters, previously fixed by Sverdrup, could play an important role in predicting the onset of a bloom. Some of these factors might include: * Production terms: Cell growth rate, cell division rate * Loss terms: Grazing resistance, viral infection rate * Fitness: photoadaptation to light conditions, respiration rates for a given environment, maintenance metabolism cost, nutrient uptake kinetics, life history, composition of photosynthetic pigments, cost of biosynthesis Given the high spatial and temporal variability of their physical environment, certain phytoplankton species might possess an optimal fitness profile for a given pre-bloom environment over competitors. This physiological profile might also influence its pre-bloom growth rate. For this reason, Lewandowska et al. propose that each phytoplankton has a specific critical depth. If none of the constituent pre-bloom species meet the environmental requirements, no bloom will occur. Direct evidence for the role of physiological factors in bloom initiation has been difficult to acquire. Using decades of satellite data, Behrenfeld and Boss argued that physiological adaptations to the environment were not significantly linked to bloom initiation (measured via cell division rate). However, recent results from Hunter-Cevera et al. using an automated submersible flow cytometer over 13 years show a positive correlation between temperature and cell division rate in Synechococcus. Warmer waters led to higher cell division rates and ‚Äúshifts in the timing of spring blooms reflect a direct physiological response to shifts in the onset of seasonal warming.‚Äù  Footnotes  References  Category:Biological oceanography ","title":"Critical depth"},{"id":"2729842","text":"Eric Raymond Grothe (born 15 March 1980) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s.

Grothe played in Parramatta's qualifying final victory over the Newcastle Knights, scoring a try in a 30-16 win. Grothe made 9 appearances the following season before departing Parramatta. Grothe sat out the entire 2001 NRL season. Grothe returned to rugby league in 2002 with the Sydney Roosters. Grothe only played eleven top grade games for the club over two seasons and did not play in the 2002 premiership winning team or the 2003 side which reached the grand final but lost to the Penrith Panthers. Grothe then rejoined Parramatta for the 2004 NRL season. Grothe starred that year and also in the following year when he became a City representative in 2005. At the end of the 2005 NRL season, Grothe finished as Parramatta's top try scorer as the club won the minor premiership. Parramatta were tipped to reach the 2005 NRL Grand Final but suffered a shock 29-0 loss to North Queensland in the preliminary final at Telstra Stadium with Grothe playing on the wing. At the 2005 Dally M Awards, Grothe was named winger of the year. At the end of the season Grothe played for the Kangaroos, becoming, along with his father, Eric, Snr., the 8th father-son combination to represent Australia.\\"Grothe follows father's footsteps into green and gold\\" By Jessica Halloran and AAP (2005-10-26) smh.com.au Grothe was selected to play for New South Wales on the wing in all three games of the 2006 State of Origin series, scoring two tries in Game 3. Grothe is possibly more famous for punching Justin Hodges in the face during an on-field scuffle between the former roommates. In the 2007 NRL season, Grothe made 23 appearances and scored 11 tries as Parramatta finished 5th and qualified for the finals. Grothe played in the club's 26-10 preliminary final loss against Melbourne in which Grothe scored a try. With the arrival of new coach Daniel Anderson in 2009, Grothe was at his powerful and explosive best. Anderson has something of a history with Grothe, having coached him as a 14-year-old in the Harold Matthews Cup back in 1995. Parramatta reached the 2009 NRL Grand Final against the Melbourne Storm. Grothe played on the wing, scoring a dominant try in the Eels' loss. Many believe that if the Eels had have won, Grothe may have received the Clive Churchill medal due to his solid grand final performance. On 13 December 2010, Grothe announced his retirement from football after failing to overcome an injury that kept him sidelined for most of the 2010 NRL season.\\"Eric Grothe Jr quits in stunning blow to Parramatta Eels\\" 13 December 2010 The Daily Telegraph (Sydney) On 25 October 2013, Eric Grothe announced his plans to return to rugby league after being out of the NRL for 3 years. On 5 November 2013, Eric Grothe signed a one-year contract with the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks for the 2014 NRL season. His NRL return was hampered by a devastating lower back injury that Grothe suffered early in the 2014 season. Outside of football Grothe continued to showcase his musical talents as a regular member of the cover band on Channel Nine's The NRL Footy Show. He also had an original band called Shinobi with his brother Daniel and mates Darren Stapleton and Wayne Langfield. Eric writes the music & lyrics for their songs. Shinobi is registered on Triple J Unearthed with track \\"Enemy\\" at Number 13.In November 2007, the band was snapped up by booking agent the Harbour Agency, but after Eric retired from football, he took his music to another level by writing and recording Shinobi‚Äôs debut album ‚ÄòAgainst The Brave‚Äô from which the title track & others received large doses of mainstream airplay on Triple M, Triple J, Channel V and RAGE as well as various other music stations and programs. Grothe Jr. was in a relationship with ex-bardot singer Sophie Monk for over two years before he broke up with her in November of 2016. Grothe Jr. now runs a podcast with his father titled UnderGrothe and also runs a successful health and fat loss business as well as a hilarious instagram account.https://www.zerotackle.com/round-7-guest-tipper- eric-grothe-jr-32625/ References External links  *Official Parramatta Eels Site *State of Origin Official website Rugby League Player Stats *Blog Site with all Parramatta Eels info for seasons 2006 and the upcoming 2007 season *Official 'shinobi' website *NRL profile Category:1980 births Category:Australian rugby league players Category:Australia national rugby league team players Category:Parramatta Eels players Category:Sydney Roosters players Category:New South Wales Rugby League State of Origin players Category:New South Wales City Origin rugby league team players Category:Wentworthville Magpies players Category:Rugby league wingers Category:Australian rock guitarists Category:Rugby league players from Sydney Category:Australian people of German descent Category:Living people Category:21st-century guitarists ","title":"Eric Grothe Jr."},{"id":"2729843","text":"Domeykite is a copper arsenide mineral, Cu3As.

Early career Powles started his music career at Nelson College, which he attended from 1973 to 1977.Nelson College Old Boys' Register, 1856‚Äì2006, 6th edition He subsequently moved to Wellington and then Auckland to join the band Flight X-7. In the 1970s he won a scholarship to join the New Zealand Youth Orchestra in a training camp in Cambridge. His interest in both classical and rock orchestrations and ambience has continued throughout his career, and was instrumental in his becoming the drummer with the Australian-formed band The Church, with whom he was inducted into the ARIA Hall Of FAME in October 2010, coinciding with the band's 30 year anniversary celebrations and touring. Powles eventually moved to Australia in 1981 where he first became known in 1980s' band The Venetians.

It is the terminus of the Cambrian Coast Railway.  History  In 1861 the Aberystwith and Welsh Coast Railway was given authorisation to build a line along Cardigan Bay between and Porthdinllaen on the Ll≈∑n Peninsula. However, the final five miles across the Ll≈∑n Peninsula were never built. By 1865 the company had merged to become part of Cambrian Railways. When the first Pwllheli station opened on Thursday 10 October 1867 the decision to not complete the final five miles to Nefyn had already been taken. The station, which was about a half a mile from the town, became the line's terminus. On 19 July 1909Transport Ticket Society Journal May 2017 page 182 a second station was opened near by the town centre following land reclamation that permitted the extension of the line. It had two tracks separated by an island platform with a small loading dock to the north. The layout remained unchanged until rationalisation began in September 1977. A goods yard was developed on the site of the first station. Its turntable is now in the possession of the West Somerset Railway. The Great Western Railway (GWR) doubled the track between Pwllheli station and the goods yard in order to increase capacity. But after the goods yard was closed and both the signal boxes and the signals were removed in 1977, the double-lined section is now used as a long run-round loop for visiting charter trains. By 1987 a supermarket had been developed on the former goods yard land. Prior to the closure of the Afon Wen to Caernarfon Line in 1964, there were two named daily express services during the summer between Pwllheli and London: *The Cambrian Coast Express ran via Machynlleth, Shrewsbury and Birmingham to London Paddington. *The Welshman ran via Caernarfon and Crewe to Euston. In 1977 one side of the island platform was abandoned and the track was lifted (the land is now a car park). The station canopy, which was constructed by the GWR, survived intact until some glass fell out in late 1979 , and it was shortened early in 1980. Today only the concourse and a short section of the platform remain covered. Pwllheli has one platform, a siding and a loop. One of the old signal boxes also remains and is used as a covered ground frame to operate the loop points. Facilities Former station building, now used as a cafe and coffee shop (April 2019) The station is now unstaffed and has no ticket machine, so all tickets must be purchased on the train or prior to travel. The main building still stands - part of it is used as a cafe and coffee shop whilst the remainder provides covered waiting accommodation. Train running information is offered by means of digital display screens, automated announcements, timetable poster boards and a customer help point. Step-free access is provided from the main entrance to the platform.Pwllheli station facilities National Rail Enquiries Services Services are operated by Transport for Wales and depart from Pwllheli for , or Birmingham International. Occasional charter services also terminate at the station. Trains run roughly every two hours on weekdays (Mon-Sat), with three departures on summer Sundays and just a single service in winter. In November 2013, services from the station were suspended due to structural problems with the 1867 Grade II-listed wooden viaduct at Pont Briwet near . Network Rail had intended to build the new bridge alongside the current one whilst keeping the latter open, but work to drive steel piles into the riverbed to support the new viaduct caused the old one to shift and made it unsafe.

As an Old Believer she holds two fingers, rather than three, raised in the old way of making the Sign of the cross. Feodosia Prokopiyevna Morozova () (21 May 1632 ‚Äì 1 December 1675) was one of the best- known partisans of the Old Believer movement. She was perceived as a martyr after she was arrested and died in prison. Life She was born on May 21, 1632 into a family of the okolnichy Prokopy Feodorovich Sokovnin. At the age of 17, she was married to the boyar Gleb Morozov, brother to the tsar's tutor Boris Morozov, one of the wealthiest men in Russia and brother-in-law of Tsar Alexis. Feodosia bore one child to Gleb, a son, Ivan. After her husband's early death in 1662, she retained a prominent position at the Russian court as a lady-in-waiting to Tsarina Maria. She also inherited vast wealth, which she administered on behalf of her son Ivan. During the Raskol, because Archpriest Avvakum was her confessor, Feodosia joined the Old Believers' movement and secretly took monastic vows with the name Theodora. She played an important role in convincing her sister, Princess Evdokia Urusova, to join the Old Believers. They were also joined by fellow noblewoman Maria Danilova. Following Avvakum, she rejected the reforms of Patriarch Nikon insisting he had no authority in the church to alter established practices, identifying such innovations with the corruption of the faith by the antichrist. After many misfortunes the two sisters and Danilova were arrested by order of Tsar Alexis of Russia in 1671. They were interrogated and tortured over a long period, but refused to recant. Attempts to reach a compromise led by Patriarch Pitirim were also rejected. While she was under arrest, her son Ivan died. Alexis contemplated having Morozova burned at the stake, but was dissuaded. Instead she and the others were incarcerated in an underground cellar of the St. Paphnutius Monastery at Borovsk, where they endured considerable deprivations. After the appointment of a new Patriarch, Ioakim, they were deprived of all support and were slowly starved. All three succumbed to starvation, in 1675, with Morozova dying on November 2. Reputation A chapel constructed on the supposed site of Morozova's death Avvakum wrote a \\"Lament for the three martyrs\\". A hagiography, Tale of Boiarynia Morozov, by an unknown author, gave an account of her life as a martyr. The story circulated widely and miracles were attributed to Morozova by Old Believers. Many Old Believer communities continue to venerate her as a martyr. Nevertheless, her reputation was limited until Morozova's role as a representative of Russian identity and tradition became important to nationalist writers in the 19th century. She became a household name after being discussed by important Russian writers and depicted by Vasily Surikov. She was also taken as a heroine by some radical groups, who saw her as a symbol of resistance to state power. The People's Will revolutionary movement promoted her, and her virtues were praised by writers of the Soviet era such as Anna Akhmatova, Varlam Shalamov and Fazil Iskander, who \\"symbolically enlisted her in their own causes of resistance\\". A chapel was constructed in 2002 on the site of the prison where Morozova died.

Its capital, Charax Spasinou (ŒßŒ¨œÅŒ±Œæ Œ£œÄŒ±œÉŒπŒΩŒøœç), was an important port for trade between Mesopotamia and India, and also provided port facilities for the city of Susa further up the Karun River. The kingdom was frequently a vassal of the Parthian Empire. Characene was mainly populated by Arabs, who spoke Aramaic as their cultural language. All rulers of the principality had Iranian names. Members of the Arsacid dynasty also ruled the state. History The capital of Characene, Alexandria, was originally founded by the Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great, with the intention of using the town as a leading commercial port for his eastern capital of Babylon. The region itself became the Satrapy of the Erythraean Sea.Daniel T. Potts (1988): Araby the Blest: Studies in Arabian Archaeology, Copenhagen, , p. 137 However, the city never lived up to its expectations, and was destroyed in the mid 3rd-century BC by floods. It was not until the reign of the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes () that the city was rebuilt and renamed Antiochia. After the city was fully restored in 166/5 BC, Antiochus IV appointed Hyspaosines as governor (eparch) of Antiochia and the Satrapy of the Erythraean Sea.Daniel T. Potts (1988): Araby the Blest: Studies in Arabian Archaeology, Copenhagen, , pp. 137-138 During this period Antiochia briefly flourished, until Antiochus IV's abrupt death in 163 BC, which weakened Seleucid authority throughout the empire. With the weakening of the Seleucids, many political entities within the empire declared independence, such as the neighbouring region of Characene, Elymais, which was situated in most of the present-day province of Khuzestan in southern Iran. Hyspaosines, although now a more or less independent ruler, remained a loyal subject of the Seleucids. Hyspaosines' keenness to remain as a Seleucid governor was possibly due to avoid interruption in the profitable trade between Antiochia and Seleucia. The Seleucids had suffered heavy defeats by the Iranian Parthian Empire; in 148/7 BC, the Parthian king Mithridates I () conquered Media and Atropatene, and by 141 BC, was in the possession of Babylonia.; ; ; The menace and proximity of the Parthians caused Hyspaosines to declare independence. In 124 BC, however, Hyspaosines accepted Parthian suzerainty, and continued to rule Characene as a vassal. Characene would generally remain a semi-autonomous kingdom under Parthian suzerainty till its fall. The realm of the kingdom included the islands Failaka and Bahrain.Pierre-Louis Gatier, Pierre Lombard, Khaled Al- Sindi (2002)Àê Greek Inscriptions from Bahrain. inÀê Arabian Archaeology and Epigraphy, Wiley, 2002, 13 (2), pp.225. The kings of Characene are known mainly by their coins, consisting mainly of silver tetradrachms with Greek and later Aramaic inscriptions. These coins are dated after the Seleucid era, providing a secure framework for chronological succession. In his Natural History, Pliny the Elder praises the port of Charax: :The embankments extend in length a distance of nearly 4¬Ω kilometers, in breadth a little less. It stood at first at a distance of 1¬æ km from the shore, and even had a harbor of its own. But according to Juba, it is 75 kilometer from the sea; and at the present day, the ambassadors from Arabia, and our own merchants who have visited the place, say that it stands at a distance of one 180 kilometers from the sea-shore. Indeed, in no part of the world have alluvial deposits been formed more rapidly by the rivers, and to a greater extent than here; and it is only a matter of surprise that the tides, which run to a considerable distance beyond this city, do not carry them back again.Pliny the Elder (AD 77). Natural History. Book VI. xxxi. 138-140. Translation by W. H. S. Jones, Loeb Classical Library, London/Cambridge, Massachusetts (1961). Trade continued to be important. A famous Characenian, a man named Isidore, was the author of a treatise on Parthian trade routes, the Mansiones Parthicae. The inhabitants of Palmyra had a permanent trading station in Characene. Many inscriptions mention caravan trade. Next to Charax, other important cities were Forat (at the Tigris), Apologos and Teredon. On his coins Meredates (ruled 131 to 150/151) calls himself king of the Omani. The latter are mentioned sporadically by ancient writers. According to Pliny (VI.145) they lived between Petra and Charax. They were according to some schola for a certain period part of the Charakene. So it seems that the kingdom extended to the South of the Persian Gulf. However, the reading and interpretation of the legends on the king's coins is problematic.Daniel T. Potts (1988): Araby the Blest: Studies in Arabian Archaeology, Copenhagen, , p. 148-149 In AD 115 the Roman emperor Trajan conquered Mesopotamia as main part of his Parthian campaign. He also reached Characene, where he saw ships bound for India. According to Cassius Dio,(LXVIII, 28, 3-29) Attambelos ruled there and was friendly to the emperor. Also the people of Charax Spasinu are described as friendly towards the emperor. The following two years, the Charakene remained most likely Roman, but emperor Hadrian decided to withdraw from Trajan's territorial gains. It remains uncertain whether the Charakene remained independent or whether it was placed under direct Parthian rule. The next Parthian king attested in ancient sources is Meredates, mentioned in an inscription at Palmyra datable to 131. In 221-222 AD, an ethnic Persian, Ardashir V, who was King of Persis, led a revolt against the Parthians, establishing the Sasanian Empire.

Two subspecies are recognised: the nominate Charadrius bicinctus bicinctus, which breeds throughout New Zealand, including the Chatham Islands, and Charadrius bicinctus exilis, which breeds in New Zealand's subantarctic Auckland Islands. Taxonomy A 2015 study found its closest relatives to be other plovers found in New Zealand, the New Zealand plover or New Zealand dotterel (Charadrius obscurus) and the wrybill (Anarhynchus frontalis), which the study found to be in the Charadrius clade. Description The double-banded plover is distinguished by a dark, grey-brown back with a distinctive white chest and a thin band of black situated just below the neck running across the chest along with a larger brown band underneath. During breeding season, these bands are more dominantly shown on the males compared to females. Younger birds have no bands, and are often speckled brown on top, with less white parts. These shorebirds have relatively long legs to allow them to easily wade around shallow waters and move efficiently around sandy beaches. Their long- pointed wings aid in traveling long distances as they allow the bird to be very agile. The double-banded plovers' head is prominent with their large, dark-brown eyes and sturdy black bills. Due to similar colors within the plovers ideal habitat, spotting these birds can be difficult to achieve however, the \\"chirp- chirp\\" call is easily heard and their habit of running quickly then pausing to feed on food can catch the eye of observers.  Distribution  Double-banded plover transitioning to breeding plumage = Range = This species is predominantly found in New Zealand as this country holds these birds‚Äô main nesting sites, however, they are partly migratory, with some dotterels‚Äô that nest in South Island riverbeds and outwash fans from the high country, generally migrate to winter in Australia, New Caledonia, Vanuatu, Fiji along with various other tropic countries. Other lowland and central southern birds move to different areas around New Zealand. Each bird will return to New Zealand to breed and for nesting season. Banded dotterels are spread throughout New Zealand however, they are more commonly located around northland coastal areas and around near off shore islands, as well as dense population located on Stewart Island. They are located sparsely on the west coast around Taharoa to the North Cape with a few isolated pairs found around Taranaki. Populations distributed throughout the Auckland and Chatham Islands have been observed to only travel locally throughout the year, whereas birds located on the mainland around high country outwash fans in the South Island generally commence migrations of hundreds of kilometres to Australia. Birds that don't migrate out of New Zealand tend to breed in the lower areas of the South Island along with central rivers and have been recorded to commonly move north to winter along coastal areas of the northern area in the North Island. Other dotterels that already breed on northern coastal lagoons and beaches sometimes only move a few kilometres away. = Habitat preferences = Northern populations of double-banded plover are commonly found to have inhabited sandy beaches and sandpits as well as few pairs accustoming to shell banks in harbours with few found on gravel beaches and nesting sites generally found clustered around stream-mouths. During the breeding periods, males create numerous nests constructed on open patches of slightly elevated sand or on shells and occasionally in cushion plants which are all mostly padded with various materials retrieved from close by. Birds found in the southern parts of New Zealand, such as Stewart Island, prefer to breed on unprotected sub- alpine and stony areas but become coastal during off-breeding months where they feed around the beach areas. Braided rivers are also an ideal habitat preferred by many dotterels around the Canterbury areas. BehaviourBreeding= Auckland Museum Auckland Museum Around the month of July in New Zealand, the banded dotterels enter the breeding season, more commonly in the South Island or southern areas of the North Island such as Hawke's Bay, Marlborough, Kaikoura Peninsula, Canterbury, Otago, Stewart Island etc. These birds form seasonal monogamous pairs where once a partner is found, they remain with that one bird for the rest of the breeding season to help raise the young. During this time, the male grows colored bands on his chest prior to the beginning of the breeding season and later females are attracted by the loud calls of the male where they are then presented with several nests which they can choose between while the male puts on a defensive display, protecting his territory, where it flies towards any possible intruder in a fast butterfly-like circular motion flight. This species usually constructs nests upon slightly elevated, open patches on the sand, shells or sometimes hollows in cushion plants or between rocks which are broadly padded with various materials such as tussock tillers, smaller stones and shells, grass, lichen, moss, twigs etc. There can be several hundred birds in one area during this season. From August to September, the dotterels lay two to four eggs and can relay up to three times if there is a failure or predation. Incubation of these eggs generally takes 28‚Äì30 days where the young fledging period extends to around six weeks. Banded dotterel chicks leave their nests upon the day of hatching where they accompany their parents in the hunt for food. At the slimmest indication of potential danger, watchful adult birds sound the alarm causing the chicks to run a few feet in a scattered motion then squat with their legs doubled over beneath them and their head stretched out firmly against the ground in front of them, camouflaging into the coastal terrain around them. They remain stationed without moving until the parents decide the surrounding environment is clear and safe to move again. Unlike the young of most bird species, these chicks will be reliant to feed themselves with parents guarding close by for five to six weeks until they fledge. The parents will then stay close by for several days until the chicks join flocks and become fully independent. Both of the parents continue to tend their young for another two weeks when birds have grown their contour feathers and the birds all part ways. Some of these birds migrate overseas to nearby countries such as southern Australia, Tasmania or other tropic countries. Other dotterels fled to the northern areas of New Zealand in groups alongside many other adult banded dotterels and newly fledged chicks. A high percentage of all off-spring return to the breeding grounds for mating within their first year, however the rest of the generation return in their second year. =Feeding= Double- banded plovers are predominantly opportunistic carnivores, feeding on aquatic invertebrates and other insects along the coast lines or rivers. They have also been known to consume berries off various nearby shrubs such as Coprosma and Muehlenbeckia. These birds forage both within the day time and at night using different techniques for both. During the day, plovers were seen spending greater amounts of time flying and more time standing alert and watchful. The birds were observed to walk, peck, run, forage, and groom both day and night, however during the day the amount of paces walked was much greater than movement at night as the birds would spot insect movement and move at a fast pace to the area to peck before moving off again. During the night, double-banded plovers were noted to have a repeated pecking techniques and spent a lot more time waiting in one area suggesting that the plovers were trying to use the nearby vicinity to catch prey in due to the fact that prey detection distances would have been significantly reduced in lack of light. This reduction of paces during the night causes prey to find it more difficult to detect the stilled birds which increases the ability of the plovers to be able to detect their prey and decreases the chance that prey could be unnoticed. Birds located on breeding grounds were commonly found to have a more varied diet containing insect larvae, spiders, beetles, aquatic insects such as caddisflies, stoneflies and mayflies along with terrestrial flies. The contents of various fecal samples from plovers included flies, adult beetles and bugs while results from New Zealand Dotterel birds tested on the Canterbury riverbeds showed large amounts of fruits of Coprosma petrei and Mueblenbeckia axillaris. Predators, parasites and diseases Being a ground- based nesting bird, many dangers arise through predation due to the introduction of mammalian predators that were introduced to New Zealand, human impacts that can cause habitat loss and various parasites that can target these birds. Hedgehogs are a common predator that pose a serious threat to the banded dotterels as they have ravenous appetites and are known to eat the eggs and chicks of these ground-nesting birds. These creatures can move up to two kilometers each night causing a number of these birds to be in danger from attacks in the area. Other mammals also pose a major threat to these incubating birds as uncontrolled dogs moving through nesting areas cause eggs to be crushed and disturbance among nesting birds can be detrimental. Cats and stoats also prey on these ground-based birds and fledglings. In one case, 41 nests were monitored in New Zealand where of the 16 nests that failed to hatch, eight of these were flooded. Feather mites (Brephosceles constrictus) can also pose a threat to the health of these birds as they feed predominantly on the blood of the bird along with feathers, skin or scales taking up to two hours. This can lead to increased levels of stress resulting in anemia, decreased egg production and in some cases, death.  Hunting and conservation  Prior to 1908, banded dotterels in New Zealand were shot in large numbers by market gunners upon the return of these migrating birds for breeding. However, in 1908, the banded dotterels were placed on the protected list, prohibiting any more shootings from occurring to the point where they are now moderately common. In 2013 local Maori in the Pencarrow Coast, Wellington region, placed a rahui on the area, to protect 20 pairs of banded dotterel from dogs and cars.Restrictions in place to protect rare bird. 3 News NZ. 3 October 2013. This species has the conservation status of \\"Regionally Vulnerable\\" in the Wellington region.

It is a member of the lute family. It is played with the index finger of the right hand. The range of the setar spans more than two and a half octaves. At some point in the 18th century, musicians added a fourth string, which most of the time is tuned to the same pitch as the bass string. The setar has 25‚Äì28 moveable frets. Frets are usually made of animal intestines (\\"gut\\"), although in the past strings were made of silk. Some modern commercial models feature frets made of nylon. The setar originated in Persia before the spread of Islam,The Stringed Instrument Database and is related to the tanbur. However, in recent centuries, the setar has evolved into something more closely resembling the tar, both in tuning and playing style. Etymology The Persian word ÿ≥Ÿá‚Äåÿ™ÿßÿ± ' is a combination of ÿ≥Ÿá '‚Äîmeaning \\"three\\"‚Äîand ÿ™ÿßÿ± '‚Äîmeaning \\"string\\", therefore the word gives the meaning of \\"three-stringed\\" or \\"tri-stringed\\".

December 2004. Retrieved 27 October 2009. He graduated from the Leningrad Theatrical Technicum in 1935 and worked in both state theatres and variety shows. In 1939, he founded his own theatre in Leningrad, where he used skits and impersonations to ridicule the inefficiency of Communist bureaucracy and the Soviet way of life. In the Stalinist police state this was prone to danger, as it was not uncommon to get purged not only for telling a casual joke, but even for not reporting it to the authorities. He also appeared in several comedies during and after the Great Patriotic War. Raikin created an array of popular satirical characters, some of which were featured in the TV serial People and Mannequins. He launched careers of several other prominent stand-up comedians, such as Mikhail Zhvanetsky and Roman Kartsev. Raikin is often compared with Charlie Chaplin. His fame in the Soviet Union, and throughout Central and Eastern Europe, was such that he was invited to participate in the opening night of BBC Two television in 1964, although the broadcast had to be postponed for one day due to a power failure. His trip to London for the BBC broadcast‚Äîduring which he was reunited with his British cousin, distinguished pianist Bruno Raikin‚Äîmarked the first of only two times when the Soviet government permitted him to perform in the West. Arkady Raikin also maintained good working relationships with Marcel Marceau and some other foreign actors. Three years before his death, Raikin finally moved to Moscow, where he opened the Satyricon Theatre, now run by his son Konstantin Raikin, also an acclaimed actor. His wife, Roma, played a major role in guiding his career, and his daughter, Ekaterina, also had a successful career as a Moscow actress. For a month during the summer of 1987, Raikin hosted his American cousin, Washington D.C. attorney Steven Raikin, as a guest in his Moscow flat.Elizabeth Kastor (5 September 1987) \\"Love & Glasnost; An East-West Romance With Comic Relief.\\" Washington Post. p.

It is a wading bird endemic to Australia and commonly found on its coastline. It prefers rocky coastlines, but will occasionally live in estuaries. All of its feathers are black. It has a red eye, eye ring and bill, and pink legs. Taxonomy John Gould described the sooty oystercatcher in 1845. Its species name is the Latin adjective fuliginosus, \\"sooty\\". Two subspecies are recognised, the nominate from the coastline of southern Australia and subspecies ophthalmicus from northern Australia. The southern subspecies is larger and heavier than the northern. The northern one, with a more yellowish eye ring, is found from the Kimberleys across the top of the country to Mackay in central Queensland. There is considerable overlap, as the southern subspecies has been found up to Cape York. Subspecies ophthalmicus has been thought distinctive enough to warrant species status and needs further investigation. Black redbill is a local name. Description Mooloolaba, Australia Sooty oystercatcher eggs in a nest on the south coast of New South Wales Measuring long with a bill length of , the sooty oystercatcher has all black plumage, with pink-red legs and scarlet or orange- red bill and eyes. The heaviest of all oystercatchers, the sooty oystercatcher weighs up to , averaging around , with females larger and heavier in both subspecies. Males have shorter, thicker bills and females have longer, thinner bills. The 19% average difference in length is the most marked of any oystercatcher species. Immature birds have grey-brown legs, a bill tipped with brown, a browner cast to their plumage, and brown eyes. The bill, eyes and legs become red by the second year. Distribution and habitat Preferring rocky shores, the sooty oystercatcher is endemic to Australia. There are an estimated 11,500 individuals, 4000 of the nominate race and 7500 of the northern race. It is common around the Tasmanian coastline and Bass Strait islands. However it is declared Rare in South Australia and Queensland, Near Threatened in Victoria and Endangered in New South Wales. Feeding The sooty oystercatcher almost always forages in the intertidal zone, for the two hours either side of low tide. A field study published in 2011 showed that prey items differed markedly between the sexes with only a 36% overlap. Females focussed on soft-bodied prey which they could swallow whole such as fish, crabs, bluebottle jellyfish and various worm-like creatures such as cunjevoi, while males preferred hard-shelled prey such as mussels (Mytilus planulatus), sea urchins, turban shells (Turbo undulatus and Turbo torquata), and black periwinkle (Nerita atramentosa). Breeding A clutch of two to three eggs is laid in a crevice in rocks or small hollow or flat on the ground, often on an island or high place where parent birds can keep watch. Tapered oval in shape, the eggs are buff to beige with dark brown and lavender dots and splotches and measure long by wide.* ReferencesExternal links * * sooty oystercatcher Category:Endemic birds of Australia sooty oystercatcher Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Sooty oystercatcher"},{"id":"2729934","text":"James John Kannis (born 5 November 1985) is a Greek-Australian singer who participated in the reality television talent show, Australian Idol.

Gidley represented New South Wales and Australia. He is also the former CEO of Football Operations at the Newcastle Knights. He played the majority of his career at Newcastle, winning a premiership in 2001, before playing four seasons for St Helens in the Super League. Background Gidley was born in Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia. Matt is the older brother of the former Newcastle Knights and Warrington Wolves halfback Kurt Gidley. Playing as a youngster in the Newcastle Rugby League for the Wests club, While attending Glendale High School, Gidley played for the Australian Schoolboys team in 1995. Playing careerNewcastle= Gidley had played all his junior football in the position, however with Matthew Johns taking up the position in the Knights line up, he slotted in to right . Gidley was selected for the Australian team to compete in the end of season 1999 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament. In the final against New Zealand he played at centre in the Kangaroos' 22-20 victory. Gidley played at centre for Newcastle in their 2001 NRL grand final victory against the Parramatta Eels. At the end of the 2001 NRL season, he went on the 2001 Kangaroo tour. Having won the 2001 NRL Premiership, the Knights traveled to England to play the 2002 World Club Challenge against Super League champions, the Bradford Bulls. Gidley played at centre and scored a try in Newcastle's loss. Gidley became famous for his wing/centre combination with former Knight Timana Tahu. A common play was for the ball to be sent out to the right side of the field where Gidley would run, draw one or two players in before doing the famous Gidley flick pass to Tahu or placing a grubber kick down the line. This play was used at both club and representative level. 2006 saw a rejuvenation of sorts for Gidley seeing him recapture some of his old magic flick pass play with Knights winger Brian Carney. In 2006 Gidley retired from representative football, aiming to focus on playing well at club level.

The company was established in 1997 by noted guitar and amplifier technician Joe Naylor, a graduate of the Roberto-Venn School of Luthiery. Reverend guitars are known for their combination of unorthodox construction methods, retro design, playability and affordable price.  History  The original Reverend models were known for their distinctive body shape as well as their use of non- traditional materials. Inspired by semi-hollow designs produced by Silvertone as well as the venerable Gibson ES-335, the original Reverend models were constructed using a core of solid mahogany surrounded by acoustic chambers. A strip of molded plastic provided the frame while the front and back of the guitar was constructed of phenolic laminate sheets in a variety of colors and finishes. All American-built Reverends were identical in body shape, with various models set apart by their pickup choices and tremolos. Because of its plastic-like texture and non-traditional appearance, the use of phenolic laminate would prove to be a polarizing design feature among players. Some guitarists were wildly enthusiastic about the distinctive style and lively tonal response, while others derided it as being too similar across the line and too plastic for their tastes. Although Reverend guitars were initially sold in large guitar stores around the country, Joe Naylor eventually made the decision to sell all of his guitars direct through an internet website for a short time. This move was one of many major changes instituted by Naylor over the years, as Naylor tried to adapt to the changing market. A short-lived line of bass-guitars, called the Rumblefish, received excellent reviews from critics but were eventually discontinued along with various amplifier models such as the Hellhound, Kingsnake, and Goblin. Naylor surprised many of the company's devoted customers when he announced that all USA Reverends were to be discontinued in favor of an imported line constructed in Korea. These guitars, known initially as the Stage King series and now known as Reverend Guitars, featured solid wood bodies and a variety of shapes. The new Reverend models have been highly regarded by players for their overall quality, affordable price, and distinctive appearance. In 2007, Naylor announced that guitars formerly made of mahogany would in the future be made of korina (Terminalia superba, also known as African limba) wood instead. Naylor cited more consistent guitar weight and excellent resonance as the reason for the change, which came into effect with guitars over serial number 07468. The company was bought by Ken and Penny Haas in 2010, and Joe Naylor retained his role as the designer and technical advisor. Under this arrangement, the Reverend Guitars line expanded to over 50 guitar models and more than 10 bass models. The company moved to Sylvania Township, OH in 2015. Reverend Guitars bought Joe Naylor's pickup company, Railhammer Pickups, in 2017 under the same arrangement as Reverend Guitars. Railhammer Pickups holds a patent for their design: US Patent No. D737891.https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/51e6f579701788104491/USD737891.pdf Reverend Guitars signature models have been created with several notable artists, including Billy Corgan, Reeves Gabrels, and Mike Watt.  Models  Reverend has over 30 models, including 10 Signature Models. The guitars are made at Mirr Music in South Korea. Every guitar is inspected and set up at the Toledo, Ohio headquarters. Reverend uses their own custom pickups on each model. All of the guitars feature Reverend's distinctive and highly lauded Bass Contour Control (BCC), a knob allowing the player to control tone more finely than conventional bass/treble knobs (which Reverend guitars also include). The BCC allows the player to add more bass for a fuller, richer sound, or to subtract it, allowing for twangier tones that approximate those of vintage single-coil pickups. Bolt-on neck series * The Buckshot, features a Telecaster-style single-coil pickup at the bridge and, for added versatility in tone, a Revtron mini-humbucker pickup at the neck.

Biography Wakayama was born on September 1, 1929, in Fukagawa, a district in Tokyo, Japan. His father was Minoru Okumura (Â••Êùë ÂÆü), a noted kabuki performer and nagauta singer who went by the stage name Katsut≈çji Kineya (ÊùµÂ±ã ÂãùÊù±Ê≤ª)Asiateca: Tomisaburo Wakayama (August 10, 2007). Retrieved on May 24, 2010., and the family as a whole were kabuki performers. He and his younger brother, Shintaro Katsu, followed their father in the theater. Wakayama tired of this; at the age of 13, he began to study judo, eventually achieving the rank of 4th dan black belt in the art. In 1952, as part of the Azuma Kabuki troupe, Wakayama toured the United States of America for nine months. He gave up theater performance completely after his two-year term with the troupe was over. Wakayama taught judo until Toho recruited him as a new martial arts star in their jidaigeki movies. He prepared for these movies by practicing other disciplines, including kenp≈ç, iaid≈ç, kendo, and b≈çjutsu. All this helped him for roles in the television series The Mute Samurai, the 1975 television series Shokin Kasegi (The Bounty Hunter), and his most famous role: Ogami Itt≈ç, the Lone Wolf. Wakayama went on to star in many films, performing in a variety of roles. It has been estimated that he appeared in between 250 and 500 films. His only roles in American movies were as a baseball coach in The Bad News Bears Go to Japan (1978) and as a yakuza boss, Sugai, in Ridley Scott's Black Rain (1989) that delivers a memorable English monologue that becomes a defining moment for the film, and the film's title. Wakayama died of acute heart failure on April 2, 1992, in a hospital in Kyoto. He was survived by a son, Kiichir≈ç Wakayama (Ëã•Â±± È®é‰∏ÄÈÉé) born in 1964, also an actor.Sankei Sports: Ëã•Â±±È®é‰∏ÄÈÉéÔºÜ‰ªÅÁæéÂáå„ÄÅÁÜ±ÊÑõÁô∫Ë¶öÔºÅ‰∫§ÈöõÔºïÂπ¥ (March 31, 2010).

History Lindale's most famous resident was John \\"Iron-Mad\\" Wilkinson, an ironworker and inventor who lived in the village from 1750, where he owned the Castle Head estate. He produced the iron for and helped design the world's first iron bridge (at Ironbridge and Broseley) and he made the world's first iron boat in 1787. A large iron obelisk stands in the village as memorial to him. Traditionally a farming village, Lindale's proximity to the A590 road has seen a growth in the number of commuters who live there.

It is located in the business and residential area Gr√∏nland, between the stations Jernbanetorget to the west and T√∏yen to the east. The station was opened on 22 May 1966 with the opening of the subway, and underwent refurbishments 1988‚Äì92. Peer Qvam was the original architect.Subway stations in the east (Oslo Sporveier) In terms of passenger volume, Gr√∏nland is one of the smaller stations in the Common Tunnel. Although the area surrounding the station is close to the city centre, it is largely residential. The station has a small shopping centre adjacent to the ticket hall underground, and there is a greater number of shops still on the surface level. There are no direct connections between the subway and other modes of public transportation at Gr√∏nland, but the central coach station and a tramway stop are located a few minutes walk from the station. The subway schedule recommends that passengers use Gr√∏nland as a transfer point between different lines because its platforms are less crowded than its neighbouring stations. The platform walls consist of white tiling, making it unequivocally the brightest subway station of the entire subway system, and its lower patronage makes it less crowded than other stations in the Common Tunnel.Rutebok for Oslo (Timetable for Oslo) History In 1987, the station underwent work to fix leaks. This was caused by cracks in the bedrock which allowed surface water to run down into the station, and was fixed by spraying a clogging chemical into the rocks. The station underwent a major renovation, starting on 1 February 1989, which included the entrance, passenger hallways and platform area. This involved replacing all fire hazards with flammable materials, including replacing vinyl sidings with tiles, making the area brighter and installing artwork made by Terje Roalkvam. The opening took place in November 1989 after investments of 11 million Norwegian kroner (NOK). The renovations were completed with only a single day of the station being closed to travelers. When the hotel Oslo Plaza opened, there was noise pollution from the metro to the hotel's reception. To elude this, the metro installed a rubber mat under the track and ballast between Gr√∏nland and Stortinget during February 1990. After having been closed for several years, the public toilet at Gr√∏nland reopened in May 1990, after the operation had been privatized, in an agreement where a private enterprise was allowed to sell flowers and collect money from users in exchange for covering the operation expenses. On 11 October 1998, a bridge was opened allowing direct access to Oslo Bus Terminal. The investment cost NOK 6 million. Service The station is located in the Common Tunnel, and therefore served by all six lines of the Oslo Metro. Each of the lines runs once or twice every 15 minutes, except at late evening and Saturday and Sunday morning, giving about 30 departures per hour in each direction during regular hours. Travel time to Stortinget is 2 minutes, while travel time to the eastern terminal stations is 10 minutes to Nydalen, 25 minutes to Vestli, 21 minutes to Bergkrystallen, 23 minutes to Mortensrud and 21 minutes to Ellingsrud√•sen.

It premiered at the Royal Court Theatre, London in 1973, with leading players Paul Scofield, Tom Conti and Michael Pennington, Production details http://www.michaelpennington.me.uk/page173.html and was published the following year by Faber and Faber. Hampton was inspired to write this play by the article \\"Genocide\\", written by journalist Norman Lewis and published in The Sunday Times Colour Magazine on 23 February 1969. Lewis described the systematic extermination in Brazil of its Indians, ranging from the 16th century to the present day under the military dictatorship. Background The play is based on an incident in the early 1960s, in which most of the Cintas Tribe was massacred on one of their traditional feast days, the Quarup. Sticks of dynamite were dropped from a plane, killing most of the members of the tribe in place. Hampton based his research about the Quarup and its legends on Mythology of all Ages and on Claude L√©vi-Strauss's works of anthropology: Le cru et le cuit and Du Miel aux Cendres. The political background was the actions of the military dictatorship in Brazil from 1964 to 1985. The regime, backed by the United States through the CIA, suppressed all political and civil opposition by widespread use of torture and intense police pressure. Four years after the military coup d'√©tat, a guerrilla movement developed under the leadership of Carlos Marighella of the A.L.N (A√ß√£o Libertadora Nacional). In 1969 and 1970, the ALN kidnapped various ambassadors and embassy officials from the USA, Japan, West Germany, and Switzerland in order to exchange them for the release of hundreds and thousands of political prisoners. Marighela was killed by the police in November 1969. By 1972, the guerilla movement was said to be crushed. Plot summary Alan West, British government official in Brazil, is kidnapped by the M.R.B. (Movimento Revolucionario Brasileiro) in order to be exchanged for political prisoners. His guard, Carlos Esquerdo, is a would-be philosopher, reciting quotes by Fanon and Camus, and interested in poetry and chess. He tries to make his hostage understand the ideas behind the revolutionary movement, reads their manifesto to him, and says that the corrupt government must be punished for \\"selling our country to the interests of US capitalism, which it has allowed to exploit our resources and steal our land, while our people starve and suffer all the miseries of poverty and unemployment\\". While Esquerdo focuses on the plight of the 90 million Brazilian workers and landless farmers, West is preoccupied with the extinction of the indigenous Indians. In flashbacks, the audience learns that West has long been interested in Indian culture, rituals, and legends, and that he is aware of the genocide under way in the country. He knows that if no measures are taken, there will be few Indians left to tell their tales and perform their cultural rites of the Quarup. They were being murdered by gifts of poisoned sugar, introduced infectious disease, and outright slaughter financed by greedy land owners and speculators, both foreign and domestic. Henchman Ataide Pereira tells an American investigator of the history of murder and mercilessness. The play also criticises missionaries; Reverend Elmer Penn is portrayed as treating \\"his flock\\" of converted Indians like domesticated animals not fit to think for themselves. An anthropologist sees the situation as clearly as West but has no power or means to change it for the better. Finally, Esquerdo shoots and kills West. The play ends with the historic bombing during the Quarup celebrations, which extinguished the Cintas Tribe. ReferencesFurther information * Hampton, Christopher: Introduction.

He was born in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, the son of a master watchmaker and jeweller. Early life He initially followed his father into the jewellery trade, but enjoyed such success with his innovative laughing songs at local concert parties that he was invited to join a theatrical tour at the age of 18. His theatrical career took off, and he appeared in music hall and the West End. One of his most successful performances was in Tonight's the Night at the Gaiety Theatre, London in 1914‚Äì15. Penrose married architect's daughter Harriet Lewcock in 1899. Performing career It was his second wife, songwriter Mabel Anderson, 26 years younger than he was, who became his most important collaborator. In 1922, Penrose made the first recording of his song \\"The Laughing Policeman\\" under the pseudonym 'Charles Jolly'. The composition of the song is officially credited to his wife Mabel under the pseudonym 'Billie Grey', but the music, melody, and laughing are taken from \\"The Laughing Song\\" by the American George W. Johnson which was recorded in 1898, 1901 and 1902. The Penroses wrote numerous other laughing songs including \\"The Laughing Major\\", \\"Curate\\", \\"Steeplechaser\\", \\"Typist\\", \\"Lover\\" and \\"Sneezing Man\\". The B-side of The Laughing Sneezing Man was a short comical sketch called \\"The Dog Vs The Cornet\\" where a little boy had to get his dog to out-sing a cornet player and make him stop playing. Radio Penrose was one of the first comedians to star on BBC Radio, his most popular role being Sgt. Bob Evergreen in the wartime radio series The Pig and Whistle.

Commonly growing in the Sydney basin of central New South Wales, Australia Grevillea longifolia is recognizable by its deep red \\"toothbrush\\" flowers which appear in spring, and narrow, sawtoothed leaves. It is fairly readily grown in gardens. Taxonomy The prolific botanist Robert Brown described Grevillea longifolia in 1830 in his Supplementum primum prodromi florae Novae Hollandiae, the specimen having been collected by George Caley somewhere in Port Jackson (Sydney) near the river. Karel Domin relegated it to a subspecies of Grevillea aspleniifolia, but the consensus is for it as a distinct species. Its name is derived from the Latin words longus \\"long\\" and folium \\"leaf\\", and refers to the long leaves. Description Grevillea longifolia grows as a shrub anywhere from high. It has long narrow leaves long and wide. The leaves have coarsely toothed margins. Appearing from July to January and peaking in September, the inflorescences are long and composed of scores of smaller individual flowers, arranged in a \\"toothbrush\\" pattern. Flowering is followed by hairy seedpods, which are prone to predation. Distribution and habitat Grevillea longifolia is restricted to the Sydney basin, particularly the southern areas and Woronora Plateau. It is found in the Heathcote and Royal National Parks, but has vanished from the Burwood and Carlton districts where it once grew. It grows on Hawkesbury Sandstone and yellow clay soils, often along riverbanks and streams. It grows in shaded or part-shaded situations in woodland or forest. It grows under such trees as blue leaved stringybark (Eucalyptus agglomerata), Sydney peppermint (E. piperita), stringybark (E. oblonga), smooth-barked apple (Angophora costata) and red bloodwood (Corymbia gummifera), and shrubs such as gymea lily (Doryanthes excelsa), and near creeks with such shrubs as Lomatia myricoides, watergum Tristania neriifolia, kanooka (Tristaniopsis laurina) and trees blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis) and coachwood (Ceratopetalum apetalum). Cultivation Grevillea longifolia adapts readily to cultivation, and can be propagated vegetatively by cutting as plants have a tendency to hybridise, making seed parentage unclear. It is grown commercially in the south of France for its foliage. It is sometimes sold mistakenly labelled as G. aspleniifolia.

The character was used in readers' prize competitions during the summer period. Anonymous employees visited seaside resorts and afterwards wrote down a detailed description of the town they visited, without giving away its name. They also described a person they happened to see that day and declared him to be the \\"Lobby Lud\\" of that issue. Readers were given a pass phrase and had to try and guess both the location and the person described by the reporters. Anyone carrying the newspaper could challenge Lobby Lud with the phrase and receive five pounds (about ¬£ in ). The competition was created because people on holiday were known to be less likely to buy a newspaper. Some towns and large factories had holiday fortnights (called \\"wakes weeks\\" in the north of England); the town or works would all decamp at the same time. Circulation could drop considerably in the summer and proprietors hoped prizes would increase it. The character's name was derived from the paper's telegraphic address, \\"Lobby, Ludgate\\". The British colloquial phrase \\"You are (name) and I claim my five pounds\\" is associated with Lobby Lud, despite being based on a similar idea thought up by a different paper. Other papers After demise of the Gazette in 1928 the competition continued in The Daily News, which became the News Chronicle from 1930,Chalkie White, 2005 article from The Guardian. in turn being absorbed into the Daily Mail in 1960.

The link is actually made up of two bridges: The main bridge crosses form Nordlandet to the islet of Rensvikholmen and then the smaller Rensviksundet bridge completes the crossing to Frei. Prior to the merger of Kristiansund and Frei municipalities on 1 January 2008, the bridges crossed the border between the two municipalities. The original bridge was in use from 1940 until 1981. The second bridge is currently in use, and a third bridge has been proposed. The bridges lies just south of the Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget. Old bridge A bridge crossing of Omsundet was initially proposed in 1875 by the town engineer in Kristiansund, colonel Christian Fredrik B√∏dtker, together with a bridge crossing of Nordsundet, but no bridges were built. The long original bridge is a steel through arch bridge. The Omsund Bridge was opened for traffic in April 1940, but with no opening ceremony because of World War II and the invasion of Norway. Local young men just tore down the barricades in the middle of the night. On 22 April 1940, German bombers tried to destroy the new bridge, but missed and managed only to kill the 15-year-old boy Ingolf Helge Vatten on a bicycle several hundred meters away on Frei, and set the forest on fire on Nordlandet. Remains of one of the bombs that caused the wildfire are on display next to the abutment. In May that year, the new bridge was crucial during the emergency evacuation caused by the burning of Kristiansund. This bridge to Frei made it possible to shorten the ferry between Kristiansund and Gjemnes on the mainland by , when a new road crossing Frei to Kvitnes on Flatset√∏ya was completed in 1951. The ferry was finally replaced with the undersea Freifjord Tunnel in 1992 as part of the Kristiansund Mainland Connection. The old bridge was replaced in 1981, but it finally opened officially in a ceremony on 24 April 2005, 65 years late, and 24 years after it was replaced. It was then made accessible again for pedestrians and cyclists, and protected as an important sample of Norwegian bridges built in the 1930s. Current bridge A new long concrete cantilever bridge, with two lanes and a fenced walkway for pedestrians and cyclists, was built right alongside of the old, narrow bridge in 1981. The bridge carries Norwegian National Road 70, in that area named Freikollveien. The main spans horizontal curvature was unusually tight, for a concrete cantilever bridge of the time. In the New Year's Day Storm of 1992, the bridge was hit by a large shrimp trawler, and concrete degradation repair was performed on the bridge in 2013.

Overview  MOF 4.0 was created to provide guidance across the entire IT life cycle. Completed in early 2008, MOF 4.0 integrates community-generated processes; governance, risk, and compliance activities; management reviews, and Microsoft Solutions Framework (MSF) best practices. The guidance in the Microsoft Operations Framework encompasses all of the activities and processes involved in managing an IT service: its conception, development, operation, maintenance, and‚Äîultimately‚Äîits retirement.  Structure of MOF 4.0  MOF 4.0 The Plan Phase focuses on ensuring that, from its inception, a requested IT service is reliable, policy- compliant, cost-effective, and adaptable to changing business needs. The Deliver Phase concerns the envisioning, planning, building, stabilization, and deployment of requested services. The Operate Phase deals with the efficient operation, monitoring, and support of deployed services in line with agreed-to service level agreement (SLA) targets. The Manage Layer helps users establish an integrated approach to IT service management activities through the use of risk management, change management, and controls. It also provides guidance relating to accountabilities and role types. Service Management Functions MOF organizes IT activities and processes into Service Management Functions (SMFs) which provide operational guidance for capabilities within the service management environment. Each SMF is anchored within a related lifecycle phase and contains a unique set of goals and outcomes supporting the objectives of that phase. Management Reviews An IT service‚Äôs readiness to move from one phase to the next is confirmed by management reviews, which ensure that goals are achieved in an appropriate fashion and that IT‚Äôs goals are aligned with the goals of the organization. Governance, Risk, and Compliance The interrelated disciplines of governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) represent a cornerstone of MOF 4.0. IT governance is a senior management‚Äìlevel activity that clarifies who holds the authority to make decisions, determines accountability for actions and responsibility for outcomes, and addresses how expected performance will be evaluated. Risk represents possible adverse impacts on reaching goals and can arise from actions taken or not taken. Compliance is a process that ensures individuals are aware of regulations, policies, and procedures that must be followed as a result of senior management‚Äôs decisions.

Housed in the Commissariat Building, Ottawa's oldest remaining stone building, the museum provides a comprehensive overview of the origins of Bytown and its development and growth into the present city of Ottawa. Founded in 1917 by the Women's Canadian Historical Society of Ottawa (WCHSO), the Bytown Museum was originally located in the former City Registry Office at 70 Nicholas across from the Carleton County Gaol. The Museum moved to its current location in 1951 and has operated from the Commissariat since, with the exception of a brief period from 1982-1985, when Parks Canada, the building's landlord, conducted renovations.  History  View from the Bytown Museum: Entrance Bay in Fall Museum's building in an 1839 painting The museum first opened as the 'Bytown Historical Museum' in 1917 in the former City Registry Office at 70 Nicholas Street, Ottawa. The Women's Canadian Historical Society of Ottawa (WCHSO), a group of some 30 women whose objective it was to advance the study of Canadian history and literature, had amassed a collection of artefacts and were in need of a more permanent home. Founded in 1898, the WCHSO had presented and prepared papers on the history of Ottawa and organized two exhibitions entitled Loan Exhibition. The first exhibit, held in 1899 at 116 Sparks Street, included a tint stone lithograph City of Ottawa, Canada West (c. 1859) by Stent and Laver Architects and three photo-based engravings (1862) by Elihu Spencer depicting the construction of the Parliament and the Departmental Buildings. The second exhibition, held in 1906 at the National Art Gallery (today the National Gallery of Canada) located on the second floor of the Victoria Hall on O'Connor Street, exhibited what was then believed to have been Samuel de Champlain's very own astrolabe (today in the collection of the Canadian Museum of History). Mayor Harold Fisher declared the building to be officially open at four o'clock on October 25, 1917. The building was used for meetings and as \\"a museum for relics and souvenirs.\\" Many Ottawa figures contributed to the refurbishing of the space for the WCHSO: Thomas Ahearn provided appliances, J.R. Booth redid the floors, and the governor of the gaol sent inmates across the street to paint and decorate the interior. The museum was housed in the Registry Building from 1917-1954. In 1951, the women secured the lease to the Commissariat and began the long process of preparing the building for the collection and the move itself. By 1954, the move was complete. When the Commissariat was closed from 1982-85 by Parks Canada for restoration work, the museum was temporarily relocated to Wellington St. The Historical Society of Ottawa (HSO) was responsible for the management of the museum until 2003, when a Board of Directors was established and the museum was registered as a not-for-profit charitable organization.  Permanent Exhibition  The museum's permanent exhibition, Where Ottawa Begins, is spread over the second and third floors of the Commissariat Building. The second floor of the museum explores the history of the National Capital Region from the origins of European settlement in the area to the incorporation of Ottawa in 1855. The third floor continues the narrative by examining the development of the city of Ottawa, the social and cultural life of Victorian times, the assassination of Thomas D'Arcy McGee and the burning of the Parliament Buildings, as well as Canada's involvement in international conflicts. The Temporary Gallery and Community Gallery are located on the second floor. The third floor houses 'A Day in My Life' -- the museum's children's area.

Awdry. This article lists and details episodes from the fifth series of the show, which was first broadcast in 1998. This series is narrated by Michael Angelis for the United Kingdom audiences, while Alec Baldwin narrated the episodes for the United States audiences. In the United States, this season was aired in 1999 on Fox Family. This is the first season of the series that was not aired on PBS. This is the first season which uses digital filming, and the last produced by Britt Alcroft Productions and Brittwood Productions. ProductionStories= The show's staff had decided since Series 3 that most of the best stories of The Railway Series had been adapted, the rest involving too many new characters or closely resembling previous stories.http://www.sodor-island.net/steveasquithinterview.html With Series 5, the decision was made to write a full series of original, staff-written stories. One reason for this was producer Britt Allcroft's desire to create a theatrical Thomas the Tank Engine movie, and requested that director David Mitton show off his modelling skills.http://www.sodor- island.net/interviews.html Series 5 aired in 1998, and the movie Thomas and the Magic Railroad was released 2 years later. Some inspiration for the stories came from a former LMR manager named David Maidment. In 1997, Maidment met with Steven Wright about the possibility of supporting the Railway Children charity, and while Wright told him the series' staff commonly received such requests, they would consider. During their meeting, Maidment relayed stories about his railway experiences working in South Wales and as the manager at station. Days later, Maidment received a call asking if he would allow some of his stories to be used as material ‚Äì the stories from The Railway Series were frequently based on true events, and Allcroft and Mitton preferred this. Maidment agreed, and was also asked to review each story to make sure that the railway in the show operated realistically. As a result, Maidment received writing credit alongside Allcroft and Mitton. 10,000 pounds ($14,406 in U.S. money) was donated to the Railway Children for his work. These stories are amongst those adapted: * \\"A Better View for Gordon\\" - the Granville-Paris Express ran through the buffer stop, across the station concourse, and crashed through the station wall; landing in the Place de Rennes below. * \\"Baa!\\" ‚Äì a ram invades a railway station and attacks some vandals; additionally, the idea of a \\"Best Kept Station\\" competition. * \\"James and the Trouble with Trees\\" ‚Äì rain erodes an embankment, causing a tree to slide down and stand upright on the tracks. * \\"Double Teething Troubles\\" ‚Äì a British Rail Class 17 diesel stalls while banking a train. * \\"A Surprise for Percy\\" - a runaway in the Garw Valley that occurred during David Maidment's time as Area Manager at Bridgend. * \\"Busy Going Backwards\\" - a couple of \\"hair-raising\\" runaway trains in the Tondu valleys that occurred during David Maidment's time as Area Manager in South Wales. * \\"Gordon and the Gremlin\\" ‚Äì bathwater in a luxury coach splashes around the compartment. The design for each new character would be chosen by David Eves, and given to David Mitton for approval. =Filming= Mitton shot 2,700 slates for Series 5, the most of any of the series he shot for Thomas. Stock Footage Theme Music From Season 3 and 4. =Broadcast= Previously Thomas had only appeared in the US as a segment on the TV show Shining Time Station, but Series 5 aired in the US as part of the half-hour Storytime with Thomas program.

A common use for it is in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect for binding of molecules to each other. It is commonly used as a substrate with hydrogen peroxide for a peroxidase enzyme (such as horseradish peroxidase) or alone with blue multicopper oxidase enzymes (such as laccase or bilirubin oxidase). Its use allows the reaction kinetics of peroxidases themselves to be followed. In this way it also can be used to indirectly follow the reaction kinetics of any hydrogen peroxide-producing enzyme, or to simply quantify the amount of hydrogen peroxide in a sample. The formal reduction potentials for ABTS are high enough for it to act as an electron donor for the reduction of oxo species such as molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, particularly at the less-extreme pH values encountered in biological catalysis. Under these conditions, the sulfonate groups are fully deprotonated and the mediator exists as a dianion. :ABTS-* \\\\+ e- -> ABTS2- E¬∞‚Ä≤ = 0.67 V vs SHE :ABTS + e- -> ABTS-* E¬∞‚Ä≤ = 1.08 V vs SHE This compound is chosen because the enzyme facilitates the reaction with hydrogen peroxide, turning it into a green and soluble end-product. Its new absorbance maximum of 420 nm light (Œµ = 3.6 √ó 104 M-1 cm-1) can easily be followed with a spectrophotometer, a common laboratory instrument. It is sometimes used as part of a glucose estimating reagent when finding glucose concentrations of solutions such as blood serum. ABTS is also frequently used by the food industry and agricultural researchers to measure the antioxidant capacities of foods. In this assay, ABTS is converted to its radical cation by addition of sodium persulfate. This radical cation is blue in color and absorbs light at 734 nm. The ABTS radical cation is reactive towards most antioxidants including phenolics, thiols and Vitamin C. During this reaction, the blue ABTS radical cation is converted back to its colorless neutral form. The reaction may be monitored spectrophotometrically. This assay is often referred to as the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assay. The reactivity of the various antioxidants tested are compared to that of Trolox, which is a water- soluble analog of vitamin E.  Applications for functional food analysis  Based on the special chemical properties of formed free radicals, ABTS assay has been used to determine the antioxidant capacity of food products. For example, polyphenol compounds, which widely exist in fruit, can quench free radicals inside human body, thus prevent oxidative damage by free radicals. The antioxidant potency of plant extract or food product has been measured by ABTS assay. One example with detailed method is the antioxidant activity analysis of Hibiscus products.

He served as governor of Kemerovo Oblast from 1997 to 2018 and became the chairman of the Council of People's Deputies of the Kemerovo oblast since April 2018. He ran for President of Russia in 1991, 1996 (withdrawing during the campaign) and 2000, coming fourth in both 1991 and 2000. Career in the Soviet Union Tuleyev was born to a Kazakh father and a half-Tatar half-Bashkir mother in Krasnovodsk, Turkmen SSR, USSR. Early at his career Tuleyev worked as a railway engineer. In 1964, he graduated from Tikhoretsky Railway Technical College with distinction. He then moved to Siberia, to be a railway clerk at the small railway settlement of Mundybash in the Kemerovo area, where he became stationmaster in 1969. In 1973, he graduated from the Novosibirsk Institute of Engineers as a railway engineer specialized in communication. From 1973 to 1978 he was railway station chief in the town of Mezhdurechensk. From 1978 to 1985 he worked at Novokuznetsk Railway Station, first as an assistant, and then as the chief of the Novokuznetsk branch of the Kemerovo Railway. In 1985, Tuleyev was appointed head of the Department of Transport and Communication in Kemerovo and in 1989 he became head of the Kemerovo Railway System. In 1990, he switched to politics and was elected to the Parliament of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic (RSFSR) from Kuzbas. In March 1990, Tuleyev was elected chairman of the Kemerovo Regional Soviet. Political career in Russia Through most of the 1990s, he was a prominent politician of the Communist Party of Russian Federation. In August 1991, he supported the GKChP coup attempt. In January 1992, Tuleyev offered his resignation from the post of chairman of the Kemerovo Oblast Regional Council in protest against the policies of Yegor Gaidar, but the deputies voted to refuse his resignation. In October 1993, Tuleyev took the side of the Parliament against Boris Yeltsin. After the events of that month, the Kemerovo regional Soviet of People's Deputies was disbanded, like many other regional branches of government in Siberia and elsewhere in Russia. Tuleyev however, decided to remain active in politics, and for this purpose, he created a new political movement in the Kuzbas, called \\"People's power. Tuleyev Block.\\" In 1993 Tuleyev got the majority of the votes in Kuzbas and was elected to the new Russian Parliament. A year later, he was voted Chairman of the Council of People's Deputies of Kemerovo. From August 1996 to June 1997 he was a Russian minister responsible for relations with the CIS in Viktor Chernomyrdin's Second Cabinet. In this capacity, he proposed plans for a union between Russia and Belarus. In July 1999, it was rumoured that he had accepted baptism in the Russian Orthodox Church. Although he denied being religious at all and claimed that an earlier visit to Mecca was not a pilgrimage, the Islamic Shura of Chechnya, under Sharia law, condemned him to death for apostasy. \\"Theologians from Chechnya and Dagestan, a neighbouring mainly Muslim region of Russia, called at an assembly in Grozny for Tuleyev's death, Interfax said. They urged all Muslims to carry out the sentence at the first possible opportunity.\\" In March 2000 as a candidate he took part in the Russian presidential elections. In 2000, he was expelled from the nationalist-communist umbrella organization called Popular-Patriotic Union. In 2000, Viktor Tikhonov, the brother of the former Olympic champion in biathlon, and former governor candidate of Moscow Oblast, Alexander Tikhonov, was charged with plotting Tuleyev's assassination and sentenced to 4 years in prison. The person who is claimed to have ordered the assassination, Mikhail Zhivilo (who has since received political asylum in France), had had a business dispute with a Tuleyev ally. In the same year, Tuleyev received his doctorate. In December 2003, he led the electoral list of United Russia in Kuzbass. In November 2005, he formally joined the United Russia, one of the last regional governors to do so. The same year, Vladimir Putin extended Tuleyev's term as governor to 2010. In 2015, Tuleyev was re- elected.

His running mate was Viktor Bocharov. At the time of his 1991 campaign, Tuleyev was regarded as a somewhat popular reformist. He was viewed as a left-wing populist. Tuleyev aimed to siphon voters away from Boris Yeltsin in Eastern Russia. He particularly hoped to garner votes from miners, a demographic which had developed significant qualms with some of Yeltsin's recent actions in granting concessions to Gorbachev over the issue of Russia's natural resources. Yeltsin's campaign attempted to combat Tuleyev's efforts to court miners by accusing him of being a candidate of the Communist Party's machine masquerading as a \\"favorite son\\" of miners. Tuleyev also appealed to non ethnically-Russian voters. As a candidate Tuleyev championed local autonomy, incremental economic reform and social defence. Tuleyev placed fourth in the election, receiving 5,417,464 votes (7% of the overall vote). He carried a 42% plurality of the Kemerovo Oblast's vote. However, his lead there was narrow enough that early returns had shown Yeltsin leading him there. 1996 presidential campaign Tuleyev ran for president again in the 1996 election. However, he ultimately dropped out before the day of the election. During his 1996 campaign, Tuleyev styled himself as a \\"muslim communist\\". However, despite being Muslim, Tuleyev failed to receive backing from major Muslim organizations. Islamic Cultural Center and the Union of Muslims of Russia backed Yeltsin and Yur backed Yavlinsky Considered to be charismatic, energetic, and well as well-liked by the Communist Party's base. He turned-in his signatures the day before the deadline. He was considered to be a fallback communist candidate, in case Gennady Zyuganov's candidacy faltered. Rather than campaigning to persuade voters to support himself, he instead was largely campaigning to dissuade voters from supporting Yeltsin and urged voters to support the so-called \\"popular patriotic bloc\\". Tuleyev's rhetoric straddled between hard-line communism and social-democracy. Generally a hard-liner, he had nonetheless occasionally taken moderate stances, such as seeking tax cuts. Tuleyev accused Yeltsin of making populist pledges that would lead to inflation. Tuleyev was opposed to renationalizing enterprises already sold to private owners, and argued the issue is \\"not how to divide the pie, but how to make the pie bigger.\\" Tuleyev's positions centered upon communism and adisciplined (uncorrupt) government. Tuleyev dropped out of the race on 8 June and endorsed Zyuganov. Despite the fact that Tuleyev dropped out of the race before the election, he had already been on the ballot during a portion of the early voting period. 2000 presidential campaign Tuleyev ran for president again in the 2000 election. In 2000 Tuleyev was opposed to his fellow- Communist Zyuganov (who was running again), and thus was not acting as a \\"backup candidate\\" like he had in the previous election. In fact, it was speculated that Putin's camp had convinced Tuleyev to run for the purpose of siphoning support away from Zyuganov. Tuleyev, in an appearance on NTV, essentially stopped short of endorsing Putin. Tuleyev served as an attack dog, directly criticizing Zyuganov and the Communist Party. His campaign platform focused on radically shifting the balance of power between the federal government and Russia's regional governments. This entailed a proposal to reduce the number of subjects from 89 to a mere 35, and for the chief executives of the subjects to be appointed rather than elected. His campaign ran ads touting his successes as governor of Kemerovo. His support was believed to be between one and two percent of the electorate. Tuleyev was seen as unlikely to (even optimistically) garner more than 5% of the vote. He ultimately placed fourth, receiving 2,217,361 votes (3% of the overall vote). He carried a plurality of the Kemerovo Oblast's vote. Private life His mother, Munira Fayzovna Vlasova (maiden name Nasyrova) died in 2001, while his father, Moldagazy Kaldybaevich Tuleyev, died in World War Two, before Aman was born. Young Aman was brought up by his ethnic Russian stepfather, Innokenty Ivanovich Vlasov. Tuleyev is married to Elvira Fedorovna Tuleyeva, an ethnic Russian. They have two sons: Dmitry, who lives in Novosibirsk, and currently works as a Manager of the Federal Highways, and Andrey (died in a car accident in 1998); grandchildren - Andrey (1999) and Stanislav, Tatiana (2005).

History Norwood Green is the modern name for the old hamlet called Norwood in the manor of Norwood; this name in turn derives from the Saxon settlement name recorded in contemporary orthography Northuuda which suggests a different final syllable, at least in some modes or among some speakers.The Place-names of Middlesex Apart from the City of London:By John Eric Bruce Gover, Allen Mawer, Frank Merry Stenton, Sidney Joseph Madge, English Place-Name Society. Published by The University press, 1942 The manor (and near-identical chapelry) of Norwood was for more than eight centuries in the parish of Hayes until 1859 when the large chapel of St Mary became on paper a church and was upgraded to have a surrounding parish. This new parish encompassed also the main clusters of cottages named after their manors of Southall and Northcotte.A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 4: (1971),Norwood, including Southall: Introduction, pp. 40-43. Date accessed: 9 October 2008.A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 4 (1971).'Norwood, including Southall: Manors', pp. 43-45. Date accessed: 9 October 2008. In 1894, under the Local Government Act 1894, Norwood Green formed part of the Southall Norwood Urban District of Middlesex. The urban district gained further status as a municipal borough in 1936 and was renamed Southall. When the municipal borough was abolished in 1965, under the London Government Act 1963, the area became part of the London Borough of Ealing. The New Zealand bass player Gary Thain of the band Uriah Heep died of a heroin overdose here on 8 December 1975. Geography Norwood Green's green (springtime, SW corner ) Norwood Green is bounded by the Grand Union Canal to the north and its continuation the canalised Brent,Parish Map, The Church of England, current ecclesiastical parish map - little changed from medieval times save for loss of Southall and Northcote east and North Hyde Lane and the line of a former brook south of that to the west. ;Current Amenities The village retains its green, church and two pubs: one by the canal, and one by Wolf Fields park.. There is a primary school in Norwood Green. The roadsides are lined with trees and there are several open spaces and wooded areas. Residential property consists of a mix of bungalows, large and small detached, semi-detached and terraced houses. ;Listed buildings ;Grade II* The parish church (in the Church of England) to St Mary The Virgin, has a bell-tower and is protected under UK law as a Grade II* listed building, which is the middle category. ;Grade II A public house, The Plough, is grade II, (i.e. in the initial category) its hand drawn beers have been mentioned in an annual CAMRA selection.CAMRA 'Good Beer Guide, year(s) needed, mentioning of The Plough under Fullers beers. Friars Lawn, a Georgian house, overlooks the Green, once a home of Gordon Selfridge of the retail family, and of the actress Hayley Mills. ;Former amenities Its own Metropolitan Police station and Post Office closed in 2008. Beside the Plough, a stables and bowling green were demolished in 2013. July village fair The second Saturday of July is when the Norwood Green Residents' Association hold Village Day on the green - a fair and activities day - and the church is decorated and opened to visitors. Transport Three Bridges (a transport intersection, designed and built by the Victorian engineer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel) in the north-east corner, is claimed as an icon of worldwide engineering heritage. Here north-south Windmill Lane goes over the Grand Union Canal (locally fed by the Welsh Harp Reservoir) on a gentle west-east reach towards the Thames at Brentford in turn above a single-track, freight, railway running from the main Great Western Main Line to just north of the major A4 road at Brentford. Two bridges exist at \\"Three Bridges\\" (the road over the canal bridge and the canal over the railway bridge) but they are stacked one above another with the road on top of the canal which is on top of the railway which is in a deep cutting at this point. The road bridge has weight and width restrictions. The nearest underground station is Osterley tube station on the Piccadilly line, which is 30-40 minutes walk from the central area; allowing 20-minute connection with Heathrow Airport; 40 minutes to Central London. Bus route 120 operates along Norwood Road with a stop at the Green itself. Buses run every 10‚Äì12 minutes during the day and every 20 minutes or so during the evening. Route H32 runs through the Western edge of Norwood Green ward (Hounslow Bus Garage to Southall Town Hall). Northwards it is just under a mile Southall railway station (Great Western Railway to Ealing Broadway (5 minutes) and London Paddington (15 minutes); Slough, Reading and Oxford plus TfL Rail trains serving Heathrow Airport and local stations to Paddington). The M4 motorway is accessed east for Central London the same distance west for Heathrow and western destinations. The A40 \\"Western Avenue\\" to the north and the A4 to the south are the nearest trunk roads and are east-west. Politics Norwood Green or as \\"Norwood\\" the place has long given its name to the local electoral ward (for local council elections) electing councillors to Ealing Council.

On 1 July 2015, the Frogman Corps transferred from the Royal Danish Navy to the newly established Special Operations Command. History The Frogman Corps was established on 17 June 1957 based on the model of the United Kingdom Royal Marines Special Boat Company, US Underwater Demolition Team, and Marinejegerkommandoen, in Norway. Initially it was under the Danish Navy's Diving School at Fl√•destation Holmen (Naval Station Holmen, Copenhagen), but in 1972 it was made an independent unit, operationally under the submarine squadron. Role The Frogman Corps' primary role is reconnaissance, but it is also tasked with assaulting enemy ships, sabotage of fixed installations, advanced force and maritime anti- terrorism tasks. It also performs special operations work on land, including anti-terrorism and anti-criminal work. The Corps supports the police with matters that demand highly specialised diving. Local authorities, etc. can also benefit from the frogmen's skills, for example when underwater installations must be inspected. Training The Frogman Corps trains at the Torpedo Station at Kongs√∏re and works through a long series of courses, e.g.: *Combat swimmer course for three weeks *Advanced scuba diving course *Rescue swimmer course *Survival course The basic Frogman Course is nine months. Each year 500‚Äì600 applicants start the course and less than a dozen complete all nine months. Since its creation in 1957, 311 have completed the training and become frogmen . Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark passed selection and completed continuation training to become a badged Frogman, in the course of which he earned the nickname \\"Pingo\\". In 2015, a DR-produced documentary detailing the life of Frogman cadets was released. Operations The Frogman Corps was involved in operations in Afghanistan such as Task Force K-Bar and in Iraq. From 2008 until the end of 2014, the Frogman Corps was involved in counter-piracy operations as part of Operation Ocean Shield. On 5 February 2010, ten Frogman Corps members aboard HDMS Absalon (L16) conducted a counter- piracy mission in the Gulf of Aden approaching the Antigua and Barbuda-flagged merchant vessel Ariella by rigid hull inflatable boat which had been hijacked by six armed Somali pirates. They scaled the side of the ship and freed the 25 crew, who had locked themselves in a secure room, and continued to search the vessel for the pirates who had however fled.

It is the most common of the white- toothed shrews. This species is found along the Mediterranean, Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland, Germany and Portugal; in addition, the Osorio shrew of the Canary island of Gran Canaria, originally described as a separate species (Crocidura osorio), was later discovered to be a population of introduced greater white-toothed shrew.Molina, O. et al. (2003) \\"The origin of the Osorian shrew (Crocidura osorio) from Gran Canaria resolved using mtDNA\\". Italian Journal of Zoology, Volume 70, Issue 2 Furthermore, a subspecies of the greater white-toothed shrew, Crocidura russula ibicensis, is found on the Mediterranean island of Ibiza. In April 2008, the greater white-toothed shrew was discovered in Ireland as well. Its preferred habitats are grassland and woodland. It is slightly larger than the lesser white-toothed shrew but otherwise very similar and can often be distinguished only by close inspection of its teeth which are unpigmented. Physical description C. russula The greater white-toothed shrew is distinguished by a careful examination of its unpigmented teeth. Like other white-toothed shrews, C. russula lacks the deposition of iron in their enamel at the tips of their teeth. This particular species has a greyish or reddish brown upper coat with a yellowish grey coat in the underside. The greater white-toothed shrews are part of the medium- sized shrews and weigh around 11 to 14 grams. The head and body length of C. russula is about 6 to 9 cm and the tail length averages to about 3 to 4.3 cm. Habitat C. russula are found in temperate regions with plentiful insects. They are generally found in habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, hedgegrows and prime agricultural areas. To prepare for colder seasons, these shrews can be found living near farms and gardens. The greater white-toothed shrews tend to build their nest under stones, logs and in abandoned burrows. Typically these shrews are found in elevations below 1000 meters. Diet The greater white toothed shrew is a carnivore, feeding mainly on invertebrates and occasionally small rodents, lizards and small amphibians. Predation The greater white-toothed shrew is preyed upon by several animals; owls (such as Tyto alba), snakes, and small carnivorous mammals such as weasels and genets are the main predators of C. russula. In order to avoid predation, the greater white-toothed shrews can be found under cover of vegetation or leaf litter when active. Cryptic coloration is also used as an effective method to avoid predation. Behavior The greater white-toothed shrews are classified as semi-social mammals. During winter, C. russula are found sharing nests and enter torpor. Mated pairs are found guarding their territories together. C. russula are highly monogamous and exhibit a female-biased dispersal, which is highly uncommon in mammals. This dispersal pattern can also occur due to infiltration and migration to empty breeding sites. Nonetheless, this dispersal pattern is a preventative measure for inbreeding. The greater white- toothed shrew can be very vocal. C. russula possess a primitive form of echolocation where they produce a high pitched twittering call to interpret their environment. The use of this laryngeal call and vibrissae allow the shrews to find their way around their environment. There have not been any concrete reports on the modes of communication used by this species, however, vocalization and tactile and chemical cues are likely to be used.  Reproduction  The greater white-toothed shrew typically experiences one breeding season in its entire lifetime, whereby fertilization occurs right after parturition. C. russula breed mainly from March to September, producing about four litters which can contain anywhere from 2 to 10 young. The sexual maturity in this species is fairly quick. The litters remain in their parental territory till the next breeding season.  Life span  C. russula has a lifespan of about 18 months in the wild, but can survive for 30 months in captivity under laboratory conditions.  Role in the ecosystem  C. russula serves as a prey species to many animals, however, an abundance in this species may lead to a decline in other small mammals such as pygmy shrews. In April 2008, the greater white-toothed shrew was discovered in Ireland and has since spread rapidly through the southern counties. While the introduction of the species will possibly sustain threatened birds of prey, such as the barn owl, the nonnative mammal could threaten some of the smaller native species, such as the Eurasian pygmy shrew.

They proclaim themselves to be \\"The World's Sexiest Rock Band\\". History Originating in Orlando, Florida, the band was founded by lead singer Gen while attending college. Originally called The Festering Genitorturers, the band consisted of Marisa (vocals), Yvonne (guitar), Gen (bass), Larry (guitar) and Mike (drums). Their first performance was at the Ocean Club in Cocoa Beach, Florida, in late 1986. Also on the bill was Declared Ungovernable, Belching Penguins, and The Rhythm Pigs. Shortening their name to The Genitorturers, the band underwent various personnel changes and progressed in the 1990s Florida \\"hardcore\\" music scene, with contemporary bands such as Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids, who would also become a success in later years. According to the band's official biography, \\"What emerged would be a band that would go beyond shaking up the house that 'Mickey' built and extend to paving the way and breaking ground for performance based music artists thereafter worldwide\\". In 1993, IRS Records owner Miles Copeland III sent his assistant Nick Turner (former drummer for The Lords of the New Church) to see the band perform. The quality of the performance, as well as their musical style containing fused elements of hardcore punk, metal and industrial electronics, led them to a record contract. Soon after that, they would record 120 Days of Genitorture. After recording this album, Morbid Angel bassist/vocalist David Vincent (Gen's husband) joined the Genitorturers on bass. He left Morbid Angel in 1995, after the album Domination, to join his wife's band. The band has extensively toured the United States, Japan, and Europe, and is internationally renowned for its exploits and erotic show content. By the time of their second album Sin City in 1998, Genitorturers had gained a notable reputation with their flamboyant BDSM-themed shows resulting in the band appearing in various television features in the USA; including VH1, Fox News, Hard Copy, HBO's Real Sex and Playboy TV's Sexcetera. The Flesh is the Law EP includes the track \\"Lecher Bitch\\", which was also included in the November 2004 video game Vampire: The Masquerade ‚Äì Bloodlines. Earlier releases included Machine Love, which contains a cover of Divinyls' hit \\"I Touch Myself\\", which was produced by Dave Ogilvie and Rob Zombie producer Scott Humphrey. In 2004, Genitorturers featured in a 12-page spread in the monthly pornographic publication Hustler, the magazine's only multi-page spread with a rock band. Hustler described Genitorturers as \\"the world's sexiest band\\". In 2006, they toured Australia with Dead Inside the Chrysalis. In the autumn of 2007, they released their live DVD Live in Sin, also selling autographed copies on eBay. The band's last album, Blackheart Revolution, was released in 2009. In 2014, Genitorturers celebrated over 20 years since the release of their debut album by going on tour, '20 Years of Depravity'.

The film generated minor controversy due to Jane Fonda's involvement, as she was one of the first major American actresses to do a nude scene in a foreign film. Synopsis In 1913, a sentimental Parisian prostitute offers herself freely to a handsome soldier because he resembles her true love. Seeking to take advantage of all opportunities for lovemaking, the soldier seduces a lonely housemaid and then goes off to make other conquests. Returning home, the despondent maid allows her employer's son to make love to her. Encouraged by the experience, the young gentleman consummates his desire for a married woman. Refreshed by the love session, the married woman makes bold overtures to her stuffy husband. Later, he takes a midinette for his mistress, but the ambitious young woman forsakes him for an author she hopes will write a play for her. Instead, he pursues an established actress with whom he had an affair years before. He has little success, however, for the actress finds satisfaction only with young men, and she has a brief affair with the Count, a young officer. Following their encounter, the Count embarks on a night of wild revelry. Morning finds him in the flat of the sentimental prostitute, who this time collects a fee for her services. The cycle of love is now complete.

At international level, Gravell earned 23 capsThe Rugby Clubs of Wales pp81, David Parry-Jones (1989) for Wales and was selected for the 1980 British Lions tour to South Africa. In his later career he became a respected broadcaster and occasional actor. Gravell was also a member of the Gorsedd of Bards, an honour bestowed on him for his contribution to the Welsh language. At the Eisteddfodau Gravell was known by his bardic name Ray o'r Mynydd and was given the ceremonial role of Grand Sword Bearer. Early life and education Born in Kidwelly, Carmarthenshire, the son of a collier, Gravell moved to Mynydd-y-Garreg at a young age with his family. Gravell was educated at Burry Port Secondary Modern School and Carmarthen Grammar School. Rugby career He first played for Llanelli RFC in 1970 and was a member of the team that beat a formidable touring All Blacks side in October 1972, eventually going on to captain the club for two seasons from 1980 to 1982. He made his first appearance for Wales against France in 1975Fields of Praise, The Official History of the Welsh Rugby Union 1881‚Äì1981 p. 442, David Smith, Gareth Williams (1980) and played in two Grand Slam winning sides, usually as a centre but sometimes as a winger. Gravell was selected to play for the British and Irish Lions in their 1980 tour of South Africa; he came on as a substitute in the first test and was in the starting line up for the next three tests. In the second test at Bloemfontein, Gravell scored his second international try, though the tourists lost 26‚Äì19 to the South Africans. Gravell also played 12 games for invitational touring team the Barbarians. First selected in 1975, Gravell faced an Australia XV at the start of 1976 before joining the Barbarian tour of Canada later that year where he played in six matches. In 1977 Gravell played his final match for the Barbarians in a star-studded team that faced the returning 1977 British Lions in a charity match to celebrate the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. Although Gravell ended on the losing team, he scored one of three tries for the Barbarians in a game seen as a classic encounter. Often epitomising the hard edge of rugby, Gravell was the classic crash ball centre, thriving on the physical contact of the sport. He is often cited as the source for the much repeated rugby phrase, \\"get your first tackle in early, even if it's late.\\" He announced his retirement from international rugby in 1982, and he played his last match for Llanelli in 1985 having played 485 times and scored 120 tries for the club. He was president of Llanelli RFC from 1998 and of the Llanelli Scarlets regional team from their formation in 2003 until his death. Broadcasting and acting career In 1985, he joined the BBC taking the leading role in Bonner, a BBC Cymru film for the Welsh Language broadcaster S4C. He appeared in the BBC TV movie Filipina Dreamgirls, and this led to a role in the 1992 Louis Malle film Damage as the chauffeur of the character played by Jeremy Irons. In the same year, 1992, Gravell appeared alongside Peter O'Toole in Rebecca's Daughters, a British comedy film directed by Karl Francis that was based on a story by Dylan Thomas. The film also starred Joely Richardson and Paul Rhys. He also played a gypsy in the 1996 Welsh cult horror film Darklands directed by Julian Richards and starring Craig Fairbrass and Jon Finch. He presented regular chat and entertainment shows for both BBC Radio Wales and BBC Radio Cymru. Up until his death, he was a member of the BBC's Welsh language rugby commentary team where he was an interviewer during Celtic League, Powergen Cup and Heineken Cup matches. He hosted a breakfast radio show on Radio Cymru in West Wales and co-hosted I'll Show You Mine with Frank Hennessy on Radio Wales. Ray Gravell was \\"rugby consultant\\" and appeared as \\"Referee No. 1\\" in the film Up 'n' Under. He appeared in the Wales episode of Floyd on Britain and Ireland (1988) where he joined Keith Floyd in the kitchen, commented on some career highlights, and translated ingredients into Welsh. Later life, diabetes and death In 2000 he was diagnosed with diabetes and ill-health plagued his later years. On 18 April 2007, it was announced that he had been readmitted to hospital following an operation to amputate two toes as a result of a diabetes-related infection, and his right leg was amputated below the knee. Because of the operation, Gravell was unable to continue his bardic duties as the Grand Sword Bearer. The ceremonial role was passed on to fellow international rugby union player Robin McBryde. In the following months, Gravell continued public duties, including appearances on television and at the Urdd Gobaith Cymru. Six months after the operation and 35 years to the day after Llanelli's famous win over the All Blacks, Gravell died of a heart attack, aged 56. He was taken ill on 31 October 2007 while on a family holiday in Spain, but did not recover and died late that night. After his death tributes were led by Welsh Rugby Union chief executive, Roger Lewis, who said \\"We are all in total shock because Ray was so full of life even through the difficult health problems he suffered recently. We will miss him as a rugby legend but more importantly, we will miss Ray as a great friend and a fine, family man.\\" A public funeral was held at Stradey Park on 15 November 2007, attended by up to ten thousand mourners from all over Wales. Gravell's flag- draped coffin was carried on to the field by six Llanelli players, from past and present, and placed on a red carpet as the ceremony was conducted. Tributes were given in both Welsh and English by First Minister for Wales Rhodri Morgan and by a number of friends and colleagues. During the ceremony, the scoreboard read \\"Llanelli 9 Seland Newydd 3\\", as it did at the end of that famous match in 1972. After the ceremony, the coffin was given a guard of honour by both the current Llanelli Scarlets squad and the remaining members of the 1972 Llanelli RFC team that beat the All Blacks. Following the public service, Gravell's family and close friends conducted a private ceremony at Llanelli Crematorium. At the time of his death, Gravell was mentoring ex-Welsh Guardsman and war hero Simon Weston in the BBC Wales 'reality' TV show The Big Welsh Challenge, in which a team of five celebrities were tasked with mastering the Welsh language in just 12 months. Weston made the decision to pull out of the show as he felt unable to continue without his friend of 20 years. Personal life Gravell and his wife Mari lived in Mynydd-y-garreg, Carmarthenshire, with their two daughters, Manon and Gwenan, on a street named after him, Heol Ray Gravell (Ray Gravell Road). His father had committed suicide when Gravell was a young man. Tribute At the Wales v France match at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on 15 March 2008, Gravell's daughters, Gwenan and Manon, led the Wales team on to the pitch carrying the Triple Crown plate. In the same match, Neil Jenkins, Wales' goal kicking coach, and other members of the coaching staff and players wore number 13 shirts bearing Gravell's name.

It opened in 2005 with one hundred names, and was a temporary installation to accompany a TV show to celebrate ITV's 50th birthday. The Avenue of Stars was a walkway through Covent Garden passing St Paul's Church, commonly known as the \\"Actors' Church\\". It honoured individuals or groups from the entertainment industry with notable achievements. As on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the individual or group was represented by a five-pointed star containing the name set into the walkway. To qualify for a star, the individual or group had to have been from the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, or a Commonwealth nation. The first inductee onto the Avenue of Stars was Jimmy Page, guitarist with Led Zeppelin. In 2006, all of the stars were removed, due to rapid deterioration and only the old flagstones are visible in the courtyard.

History William Sanderson was born in Leith, Scotland January 27, 1839. He started an apprenticeship with wine and spirituous liquors producer, Matthew Buchan at the age of 13. By 1863, he already owned his own business producing liqueurs and whisky blends. In 1880, his son William Mark joined the business and persuaded his father to bottle various blends of whisky. The iconic Vat 69 bottle with its bulbous neck was introduced to the market and was not changed for the next hundred years. In 1882, William Sanderson prepared one hundred casks of blended whisky and hired a panel of experts to taste them. The batch from the cask (or ‚Äúvat‚Äù) with number 69 was judged to be the best, and this provided the whisky's brand name. The whisky was at first bottled in port bottles. In 1884, Sanderson bought the Glen Garioch distillery which was situated in the middle of a barley field. The distillery was meant to ensure the delivery of grain whisky. Sanderson took care that there were always new products to be blended, because DCL, which was a strong society at that time, controlled such a large amount of the production that it had a huge influence on the supply of the competing company. For this reason Sanderson, together with Usher and Bell, founded a company to produce grain whisky, which still exists today as the North British Distillery. Sanderson sourced a few malt whiskies used to blend VAT 69 from a friend, John Begg, who owned the Royal Lochnagar distillery. When Begg died, Sanderson became director of Begg's distillery. In 1933, Sanderson's company merged with Booth's Distilleries, which merged again with the DCL group in 1935. In autumn 1980, \\"Vat 69 Reserve\\" from the House of Sanderson had its world premi√®re in England. Blend Vat 69 production in 1972. Despite its name, it is not a vatted malt, but a blend of about 40 malt and grain whiskies. Vat 69 Reserve carries no standard age statement. Since autumn 1980, Glenesk, which is a 12-year-old Highland Single Malt (40%), is available from Sanderson in Germany. Glenesk is stored for at least 12 years in sherry barrels. Since 1964, William Sanderson & Sons Ltd. has produced \\"Antiquary\\", which is a 12-year-old De-Luxe-Scotch- Whisky (40%). Products Whisky products available from Sanderson in Germany are: * VAT 69 Finest Scotch Whisky (40%) * VAT 69 Reserve de Luxe Scotch Whisky (40%) * Glenesk Single Malt Highland Scotch 12 Years Old (40%) * The Antiquary de Luxe Old Scotch Whisky 12 Years Old (40%). Whisky products available from Sanderson in Australia are: * 700 mL Vat 69 Fine Scotch Whisky (40%) Media appearances Captain Lewis Nixon, an American World War II army officer who is a major figure in the 1992 non-fiction book Band of Brothers by Stephen E. Ambrose and the award-winning 2001 HBO miniseries made from it, is portrayed as an enthusiastic drinker who went to great lengths to obtain supplies of Vat 69. At approximately 1:36:27, a bottle of Vat 69 can be seen on the wall of the bar called Martini's, in 1946's \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\". A Vat 69 dispenser and bottle can be seen behind the bar of Fawlty Towers in the 1975 British television comedy of the same name. A bottle of Vat 69 can be seen on the shelf behind Nelson, barman of the Railway Arms in episode 1, series 2 of \\"Life on Mars\\". Dan Turner, Hollywood Detective, a fictional character created by pulp magazine, radio, and TV writer Robert Leslie Bellem, kept a ready supply of Vat 69 in his apartment, and had remarkably good luck finding a handy bottle at most of the murder scenes he investigated. Penny Priddy, a character in \\"The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension\\", got drunk on Vat 69 in the scenes where Buckaroo was playing in a club. Orson Welles in \\"The Roots of Heaven\\" (1958) is seen drinking from a bottle of Vat 69 in his first appearance in the film. A bottle of Vat 69 can be seen being removed from the clenched hand of a dead man in the 1959 film \\"Our Man In Havana\\" starring Alec Guinness. Vat 69 is referenced by the protagonist of the BBC show Yes, Minister in the episode \\"English Customs\\", where a British delegation to a fictional Arab country is trying to sneak alcoholic beverages to a party held in their honour by their (presumably Muslim) hosts. Stanley Baker pours a glass of Vat 69 in a casino in Venice in the movie directed by Joseph Losey, Eva from 1962. Gregory Peck, as Brigadier General Frank Savage, pours an impressive half a tumbler glass for himself from a bottle of Vat 69 in the 1949 movie, \\"Twelve O'Clock High\\" while speaking with his commanding officer, Major General Pritchard, who is lying sick in bed. In a cartoon \\"Gustavus ( Gustav ) wants to marry\\" you can see the main character pouring VAT 69 into two glasses for him & his date.

Biography Philippe Ricord was born on 10 December 1800 in Baltimore. His father had escaped the French Revolution in 1790 from Marseille. He met French naturalist Charles Alexandre Lesueur, who took him back to Paris in 1820. He worked for Lesueur as curator of his specimens, and at hospitals such as Val-de-Gr√¢ce and H√¥tel-Dieu de Paris. He studied under Guillaume Dupuytren, but fell out with him when Ricord published an article pointing out a procedure Dupuytren claimed to have invented was already in use in America. He transferred to Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re Hospital to study under Jacques Lisfranc de St. Martin. He graduated in medicine in 1826. After practicing in the provinces he returned in 1828 to the capital, and worked there as a surgeon, specializing in venereal diseases. Doctor Ricord was surgeon in chief to the hospital for venereal diseases and to the H√¥pital du Midi. He won a worldwide reputation in his special field. For his suggestions on the cure of varicocele and on the operation of urethroplasty he received in 1842 one of the Montyon prizes. In 1838, he disproved John Hunter's self-experiment, thus showing that syphilis and gonorrhea are not the same disease. Ricord's chancre is the parchment-like initial lesion of syphilis. In 1862 Ricord was appointed physician in ordinary to Prince Napoleon. On 26 October 1869, he was named consulting surgeon to Napoleon III. For his services in the ambulance corps during the siege of Paris he was made Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor in 1871.New International Encyclopedia He was the brother of Jean Baptiste Ricord (1777‚Äì1837) who was a physician and naturalist in America. Jean Baptiste's son (Phillipe's nephew) took the name John Ricord, became a lawyer who practiced law in several notable cases while he traveled through the Republic of Texas, Oregon Territory, the Kingdom of Hawaii, and the California Gold Rush. John Ricord returned to live with Phillipe where he died in 1861. There seems to be a controversy as to whether Jean Alfred Fournier, student of Ricord, was actually his son-in-law Ricord's formula Ricord developed an innovative formula for the treatment of urethritis, largely used at least up to the late 1910s. It consists of a solution containing 1g zinc sulfate, 2g lead acetate, 4g Sydenham laudanum and catechu tincture in 200ml of distilled water. This formula was widely known and employed for the washing of tissue affected by simple urethritis thanks to its astringent and antiseptic properties..

Regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority, the course is designed as an intense programme covering roughly the same content as a Law degree LL.B (Hons) and the main goal is to allow people with a greater variety of educational backgrounds into the legal profession.http://www.sra.org.uk Most CPE courses award a diploma and are thus often titled Postgraduate Diploma in Law (PGDL). Common post-nominal abbreviations include LL.Dip (Lex. Legis Diploma), or Dip.Law (Diploma in Law). The CPE is one (full-time) or two (part-time) years long, and successful candidates may proceed to either the Legal Practice Course (LPC) for solicitors or the Barrister Training Course (BTC) for barristers.Chambers Student Guide 2012 It is regulated by the Law Society of England and Wales with admissions handled through the Central Applications Board. Some law students study for four years (rather than three years, although this is usually only the case for students taking a combined law degree with the LPC, or for those whose courses include study abroad), making it possible for both non-law and law graduates of the same starting year to finish at the same time, with the CPE providing the \\"foundations of legal knowledge\\".  UK course providers  In 1977, the former Inns of Court School of Law (now merged into City, University of London) launched their CPE/PGDL programme, which was the first of its kind in England and Wales. The PGDL tends to be offered through private institutions or universities. The largest course providers are BPP Law School, City Law School and The University of Law. The PGDL is also offered by several British universities including Cardiff University, the University of East Anglia, Keele University, the University of Sheffield, the University of Brighton, the University of Sussex, Swansea University, Birmingham City University, Manchester Metropolitan University, London Metropolitan University, the University of Westminster, University of the West of England, Middlesex University, De Montfort University and the University of East London as well as Oxford Brookes University. Hong Kong In Hong Kong a localised mutation of the CPE known as the Graduate Diploma in English and Hong Kong Law is also recognised for the purpose of admission to the Postgraduate Certificate in Laws (PCLL) course, which can be seen as the local equivalent to the LPC/BPTC and is a prerequisite to become a solicitor or barrister in Hong Kong. Since 2008, all graduates of overseas universities are required to demonstrate competence in three Top-up Subjects on Hong Kong law before they can enter the PCLL, usually by sitting conversion examinations in these three subjects. However graduates of the GDEHKL do not need to sit these three conversion examinations because the course is recognised by the Standing Committee on Legal Education and Training as demonstrating competence in the three Top-up Subjects on Hong Kong law. = Graduate Diploma in English and Hong Kong Law = The CPE/GDEHKL is offered by the University of Hong Kong's School of Professional and Continuing Education (HKU SPACE) in Hong Kong jointly with Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU).

This series was narrated by Michael Angelis for the United Kingdom audiences, while Michael Brandon narrated the episodes for the United States audiences. This is the first season produced by HIT Entertainment. Production Starting with this series, Thomas & Friends broadcast in the United States for the first time as a whole television program. It had first appeared as sequences from the American television show Shining Time Station from 1989 to 1995. For the eighth series, Steve Asquith (after 20 years as a crew member) took over as director from David Mitton (who had directed the show since its first series) and Simon Spencer became the producer. In addition, Robert Hartshorne and Ed Welch took over as composers and songwriters after Mike O'Donnell and Junior Campbell departed. Paul Larson and Abi Grant were the script editors for this series. This was the first series to introduce a new opening and closing credits, plus a brief description of the Island of Sodor before each episode began. Also starting with this series, the length of the episodes were increased to seven minutes from the original four-and-a-half minutes. The series was produced using digital Betacam Sp video cameras, which created a somewhat different look for the show. There was also a subtle shift towards the use of CGI elements, provided by HiT Entertainment's subsidiary HOT Animation,How Thomas the Tank Engine Works although filming remained at Shepperton Studios. For the United States broadcasts, other changes include the additions of CGI sequences in mini-segments between episodes, transition effects, and a book opening intro section.

It is located to the east of the Western Express Highway, which is part of the National Highway 8.  Urban development  As a part of rapid urban development in this locality, a significant number of residential complexes were constructed here since the early 1990s. The area is broadly divided into two distinct categories of housing complexes: the high-rises and the low-rises. The high-rises (20+ floors) include Viceroy Savana, TW Gardens, Evershine Crown, Gundecha Premiere, Gundecha Greens, Thakur Jewel, Gokul Gagan, Vishnu Shivam Tower, Gokul Concorde, Challengers, Oberoi Gardens, Oberoi Park View, Viceroy Park, Evershine Millenium Paradise Halley 47-49, and Raheja Reflections Phase 2, Sarova Alpine. There are also various new buildings in construction correctly, as of September 2020. The low-rises include Vasant Sagar and Vasant Utsav which are very famous for dozens of shops under it where people come to hangout, as these places have numerous eateries too. They also include Evershine Millennium Paradise except for Halley 47-49, Gundecha Valley of Flowers, Viceroy Court, Raheja Reflections Phase 1, NG Suncity, and Bhoomi Valley. These eight complexes put together cover most of the land area of Thakur Village, and house most of the middle- class population. Of these, Evershine Millennium Paradise is the largest, with 75 buildings having nearly 2,400 housing units. There are a handful of single low-rise buildings (not complexes). These lack basic society amenities like clubhouse, pool etc, but are also priced lower than their upscale neighbors. These include but aren‚Äôt limited to: Gundecha Sunflower, Gaurav Shikhar, Mahadev, ISM House, Mineral House, Shree Ganesh Aangan, Vasundhara, Bhoomi Hills, Hill View Park, Techno Park - I, Techno Park - II, Kelipada, Laxmi Sadan, Thakur Aspire, and Tirupathi the Windsor. Connectivity The area boasts excellent internal and external connectivity. It is located on the busy Western Express Highway, which becomes the NH8 (Mumbai-Ahmedabad) outside Mumbai city limits. There are two approaches from the highway: one at the Mahindra and Mahindra junction, and the other at Magathane Telephone Exchange. Both approaches have flyovers / underpass which makes entry and exit very easy. It is equidistant from Kandivali and Borivali railway stations which fall on the Western Railway's suburban section. Almost all outstation trains on the Western Railway stop at Borivali. The domestic and international airports can also be reached quickly due to the proximity to the highway. Mumbai-Pune Shivneri Volvo buses operated by MSRTC can also be boarded from the nearby Sukurwadi or Nancy Colony bus depots. The area is well serviced by the public transport buses operated by BEST. Route 287 connects the area to Kandivali station and routes 209, 629 and 703 to Borivali station. Route 223 is a fairly long-distance route that runs along the Link Road and connects to the business hub of Mindspace and the Bollywood hub of Andheri Lokhandwala. Air-conditioned buses operated by BEST and NMMT provide direct connectivity to the business districts like NKP (Nirlon Knowledge Park, Goregaon), SEEPZ, Hiranandani-Harsh Mulchandani (Powai), BKC (Bandra Kurla Complex), Worli, Cuffe Parade, Backbay, MBP (Millennium Business Park, Airoli) and CBD Belapur. Internally, a 120-foot wide cement-concrete (CC) road acts as the traffic backbone of the area. Besides this, the area is well serviced by a network of inter-connected roads, cross-roads and lanes. From 10 July 2013, MSRTC has started the Shivneri Corporate bus service from Thakur Village to BKC. The promotional fare is priced at Rs. 100. Citizen Activism Thakur Village Residents' Forum- an open and voluntary group of residents from Thakur Village, implemented a \\"Say no to plastic bags & Carry your own Cloth Bag\\" policy from 1 November 2017 whereby the local vegetable and other roadside- vendors were individually educated about the dangers of plastic bags and were requested to refrain from giving plastic bags to their customers. This is an ongoing initiative spearheaded by the volunteers of the Residents' Forum that also includes interacting with customers and informing them of this Initiative, distributing cloth-bags and keeping a close eye on the usage of plastic bags in the area on a regular basis. This purely voluntary but impactful initiative has received its fair share of media coverage through Mumbai Mirror, Zee Marathi etc. and has been hailed by all Mumbaikars with Citizens' Forums from some other parts of Mumbai getting in touch with Thakur Village Residents' Forum wanting to learn from their experience before starting a similar initiative in their respective areas. The slogan of this Initiative is \\" Soch Sayaani \\" which translates to \\"Clever Thought\\". A Hindi version of the Soch Sayani song has already been released and work on the Marathi and Kannada version is currently on. The Thakur Village Residents' Forum hopes to transform this initiative into a movement- a movement run by citizens for citizens with the help of citizens. Community newspaper Neighbourhood Times, Kandivali East's weekly community newspaper, was launched on 17 February 2011. It covers local issues, events and news.  Medical  Suburban Diagnostics, a large diagnostic center, is located opposite Thakur College with multiple facilities. Sarodev Orthopaedic Hospital and Rehabilitation centre is an orthopaedic hospital located in the nearby Thakur Complex. Ayurvedic Treatments like Panchkarma are available at clinics in the vicinity like Spandan Ayurved. Many Ayurvedic medicine stores are also in the area. Economy A number of banks have their branches and 24-hour ATMs in Thakur Village, which include HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Andhra Bank, Indian Bank, Karnataka Bank, Allahabad Bank, Bank of Baroda, Bank of Maharashtra, Central Bank of India, Canara Bank, Saraswat Bank, Pratap Co- operative Bank, Federal Bank, State Bank Of India, Oriental Bank of Commerce and Kotak Mahindra Bank (previously ING Vysya Bank).

For the film that was aired as Creature on SciFi UK, see Alien Lockdown Creature (also known as The Titan Find and Titan Find) is a 1985 American science fiction horror film directed by William Malone, starring Stan Ivar, Wendy Schaal, Lyman Ward, Robert Jaffe and Diane Salinger. It features early special effects work by Robert and Dennis Skotak, who would go on to design the special effects for Aliens.. Plot In the film's prologue, two geological researchers for the American multinational corporation NTI encounter an ancient alien laboratory on Titan, the largest moon of Saturn. In the lab is an egg-like container which is keeping an alien creature alive. The creature emerges and kills the researchers. Two months later, the geologists' spaceship crashes into the space station Concorde in orbit around Earth's Moon, its pilot having died in his seat. NTI dispatches a new ship, the Shenandoah, to Titan. Its crew, consisting of Captain Mike Davison (Stan Ivar), Susan Delambre (Marie Laurin), Jon Fennel (Robert Jaffe), Dr. Wendy H. Oliver (Annette McCarthy), David Perkins (Lyman Ward) and Beth Sladen (Wendy Schaal), is accompanied by the taciturn security officer Melanie Bryce (Diane Salinger). While in orbit, the crew locate a signal coming from the moon‚Äîthe distress call of a ship from the rival West German multinational Richter Dynamics. Their own landing turns disastrous when the ground collapses beneath their landing site, dropping the ship into a cavern and wrecking it. When radio communication fails, a search party is sent out to contact the Germans. In the West German ship, they find one of the containers from the prologue breached, as well as the dead bodies of the crew. The creature appears and kills Delambre when she lags behind the escaping group. Fennel enters a state of shock at the sight and Bryce sedates him. When they return to their own ship, the Americans find that one of the West Germans, Hans Rudy Hofner (Klaus Kinski), has snuck aboard. He tells them how his crew was slain by the creature, which was buried with other organisms as part of a galactic menagerie. He proposes returning to his ship to get explosives, but the crew are unwilling to risk it. It becomes apparent that the creature's undead victims are controlled by the creature through parasites. Unsupervised in the medbay, Fennel sees the undead Delambre through a porthole and follows her outside. She strips naked, and he stands transfixed while she removes his helmet. He asphyxiates, and then she attaches an alien parasite to his head. Now under alien control, Fennel sends a transmission to his crewmates, inviting them over to the German ship. Hofner and Bryce are sent to get some air tanks for the Shenandoah and stand guard over it, while the rest of the crew go over to the Richter ship. Hofner and Bryce stop over at the menagerie on their way, and are attacked by Delambre, who has had a parasite attached earlier. The rest of the crew go over to the Richter ship, and find Fennel with a bandage on his head to conceal his parasite. Davison insists that medical officer Oliver examine his head, so Fennel has her accompany him to the engineering quarters to feed her to the creature. Davison and Perkins notice Fennel doesn't sweat and go check on them. They are too late to rescue Oliver, who is decapitated by the creature, but Perkins blows up Fennel's head with his pistol. Soon afterwards, Sladen runs into an infected Hofner. She escapes the ship, and in her haste, only puts on her helmet after exiting. Perkins spots her outside and opens the airlock. Now unconscious, Sladen is carried in by Hofner to lure the others. They fight, and Davison manages to defeat Hofner by ripping off his parasite. The three survivors formulate a plan to electrocute the creature with the ship's fusion modules, which can only be accessed by going through the engineering quarters. Alarms suddenly sound as a creature makes its way through the ship, committing sabotage. Sladen and Davison go through engineering to construct an electrocution trap, while Perkins goes to the computer room to monitor the creature. Sladen finishes rigging the trap just in time for the creature's arrival, and they apparently electrocute it to death. However, when Davison leaves, it captures Sladen. Davison and Perkins follow her screaming and find her locked inside engineering. Studying the ship's blueprints, they find another entrance to engineering and sends Perkins to lure away the creature while Davison retrieves Sladen. On the way, Perkins locates one of the bombs Hofner had mentioned, just before the creature jumps him. Dying, Perkins manages to attach the bomb to the creature and set off the countdown so Davison can jettison it through the airlock. It climbs back aboard, however, so Davison tackles it, throwing himself out the airlock in the process. When the bomb fails to explode, Bryce appears and shoots it, which sets it off and kills the creature. She recovers Davison and reunites with Sladen, who dresses Davison's wounds. Finally, the trio leaves Titan aboard the West German ship.

The parish name takes account of local usage, and the location of the parish church; in fact the main population centre is to the north, and is called Hooe Common. History The name Hooe comes from the Saxon word meaning a ridge, since the village stood on a ridge of land between two arms of the sea. Those areas are now low-lying land, one being the Hooe Levels, across which flows the stream known as Waller's Haven. The River Ashbourne flows into the Haven, down which iron products, particularly cannon, used to be shipped from the Wealden iron works at Ashburnham. During the 18th century Hooe was connected with other local gangs in smuggling.There was a high demand in France for English wool with the local Romney(Kent)sheep producing fine wool and valuable meat which was traded or smuggled via small boats off Normans Bay - for brandy, wines[used by the church] and tobacco etc. The church, dedicated to St Oswald, is part of a combined ecclesiastical parish with that at Ninfield. Hooe church, both Saxon and Norman, was built in its location as meeting point of several of the surrounding hamlets, including Hooe Common. There were suggestions by a local historian that there was a village surrounding the church but this was burnt down during the plague and the village moved to Hooe Common but there is no archaeological evidence for this. There is an abandoned medieval village, Northeye, which is located on Hooe Levels. This may have been abandoned during the plague. Landmarks Hooe windmill was situated where the house the Retreat is now, next to the recreation ground. Henry the 8ths hunting lodge is located at Court lodge where he stayed with Katherine Howard before they were married! Pevensey Levels, a Site of Special Scientific Interest, lies partially in the parish. The site is of biological interest consisting of low-lying grazing meadows, hosting a wide variety of wetland flora and fauna The hardy docile all red\\\\ginger Sussex cattle which arrived in Viking days are very well suited to the Hooe Levels where they were once used as oxen to transport goods locally -they thrive on the mineral rich marshland where they are grass finished to produce some of the best beef in the world! Public Transport Renown Coaches operate two buses services Monday-Friday which consists of: Route 97: Currently Departs Hooe Lamb Inn at 09:03 and 12:03. There is a 15:03 on non school days which operates via Hooe Common 5 minutes later. (This is subject to change due to the national concessionary pass times changing.) These buses operate to Bexhill. There is also a School bus which departs Hooe Common at 08:08 to Claverham with a bus departing Claverham at 15:30. This is route 356.

Not prolific, and little remembered today, Jones was ground-breaking in science fiction. His first story, \\"The Death's Head Meteor\\", was published in Air Wonder Stories in 1930, possibly recording the first use of \\"astronaut\\" in fiction. He also pioneered cyborg and robotic characters, and is credited with inspiring the modern idea of cryonics. Most of his stories fit into a \\"future history\\" like that of Robert A. Heinlein or Cordwainer Smith, well before either of them used this convention in their fiction.  Professor Jameson stories  \\"The Planet of the Double Sun\\", the second entry in the \\"Professor Jameson\\" series, was the cover story in the February 1932 issue of Amazing Stories \\"Time's Mausoleum\\", the fifth \\"Professor Jameson\\" story, was cover-featured on the December 1933 issue of Amazing Stories \\"The Music-Monsters\\" was the last \\"Professor Jameson\\" story to be published in Amazing Stories, taking the cover of the April 1938 issue Rating not even a cover mention, the first installment of Jones' most popular creation, \\"The Jameson Satellite\\", appeared in the July 1931 issue of Amazing Stories. The hero was Professor Jameson, the last Earthman, who became immortal through the science of the Zoromes. Jameson was obsessed with the idea of perfectly preserving his body after death and succeeded by having it launched into space in a small capsule. Jameson's body survived for 40,000,000 years, where it was found orbiting a dead planet Earth by a passing Zorome exploration ship. The Zoromes, or machine men as they sometimes called themselves, were cyborgs. They came from a race of biological beings who had achieved immortality by transferring their brains to machine bodies. They occasionally assisted members of other races with this transition (e.g. the Tri-Peds and the Mumes), allowing others to become Zoromes and join them on their expeditions, which sometimes lasted hundreds of years. So, much like the Borg of the Star Trek series, a Zorome crew could be made up of assimilated members of many different biological species. The Zoromes discovered that Jameson's body had been so well preserved that they were able to repair his brain, incorporate it into a Zorome machine body and restart it. The professor joined their crew and, over the course of the series, participated in many adventures, even visiting Zor, the Zorome homeworld, where he met biological Zoromes. The professor eventually rose to command his own crew of machine men on a new Zorome exploration ship. \\"The Jameson Satellite\\" proved so popular with readers that later installments in Amazing Stories got not only cover mentions but the cover artwork. The series eventually became some of the most popular and well-known of the 1930s pulps. Being cryopreserved and revived is an idea that would recur in hundreds of science fiction novels, movies, and television shows. One young science fiction fan who read The Jameson Satellite and drew inspiration from the idea of cryonics was Robert Ettinger, who became known as the father of cryonics. An eleven and a half year old Isaac Asimov also read the story. Asimov noted that the Zorome's organic brains were a minor detail, \\"Jones treated them as mechanical men, making them objective without being unfeeling, benevolent without being busybodies.\\" He cites Jones' Zoromes as the \\"spiritual ancestors\\" of his positronic robot series and credits them as the origin of his attraction to the idea of benevolent robots. Masamune Shirow paid homage to Jones in his cyborg-populated Ghost in the Shell saga by including a no-frills brain-in-a-box design, even naming them Jameson-type cyborgs. Just as the Jameson stories inspired Asimov, Ettinger, and other young readers, Neil R. Jones has said he was inspired to invent the Zoromes by H. G. Wells' Martians from The War of the Worlds, whose weak bodies were augmented by giant war machines. He also drew inspiration from Sewell Peaslee Wright's stories of Commander Hanson and the space patrol which were running in Astounding Stories around the time Jones began writing the Jameson series. Jameson (or 21MM392, as he was known to his fellow metal beings) was the subject of twenty-one stories between 1931 and 1951, when Jones stopped writing, with nine stories still unpublished. In the late 1960s, Ace Books editor Donald A. Wollheim compiled five collections, comprising sixteen of these, including two previously unpublished. In all there were thirty Jameson stories written (twenty four eventually saw publication, six remain unpublished), and twenty-two unrelated pieces. R. D. Mullen, reviewing The Planet of the Double Sun, commented that while many readers have found the stories memorable despite their exceptionally crude writing, he found the characters and events \\"of such little interest that I feel no desire to follow them through the succeeding stories.\\" Everett F. Bleiler found the stories marked by \\"drearily innocuous similarities\\" as well as \\"weak writing and literary flatness.\\"Bleiler & Bleiler 1998, pp. 196-198. In contrast, Isaac Asimov wrote of his experience reading the Jameson Satellite as a pre-teen, \\"None of the flaws in language and construction were obvious\\" ... \\"What I responded to was the tantalizing glimpse of possible immortality and the vision of the world's sad death\\".

It was established on 3 February 1838 and named Jessore Zilla School after 1872. Though the school was established under a government order, it was founded with donations from local people. On 27 January 1845, the wife of the zamindar of Naldi Pargana made an annual grant of Tk 300 for running the school. The school received financial and other help from persons like Babu Ramratan, Nilkamal Pal Chowdhury, Raja Barodakanta Roy, Darakanath Thakur, Kunjalal Thakur, Moulavi Abdulllah, Mohammad Karim, Pranonath Chowdhury, Shukh Das Roy, Radhamohan Gosh Chowdhury and Kalikanta Poddar. ‡¶∂‡¶π‡¶ø‡¶¶ ‡¶Æ‡¶ø‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶∞ JZS School Campus from one side. History The school was launched with 132 students in the bungalow of Rani Kattayani of Naldi. Later, Jessore Zilla School acquired 7.8 acres of land in the Kharki-Jessore mouza and was shifted there after building new houses. Jessore Zilla School introduced teaching of Persian language in 1874 and of Urdu after 1947. Urdu was the medium of instruction for non-Bengali students of the school. The Pakistan government undertook the development of the school under a pilot project in 1963. That year a new stream of science group alongside the existing humanities group was introduced in the school. The commerce group was introduced in 1965 and in 1970, students got the opportunity to register in the fine arts group. The school has common rooms, a science laboratory and a library.

Student life The school and its students have a good record of performance in extracurricular activities including publication of a magazine titled Jagaran. The students take active part in the scouts, and red-crescent movement. They also participate in sport competitions and national debates including some on TV. The school runs in two shifts. In 2000, it had 1,453 students, of whom 752 were in the morning shift (7-12 am) and 701 in the day shift (12.20-5.35 pm). Now, the number is almost 2000. The number of teachers was 44, of whom 39 were men. The results of the students in public examinations are excellent. The library has a collection of about 5,000 books and many of these books are very rare. Jessore Zilla School has nine buildings including a two-storied students' hostel, an administrative building, and residential quarters for the employees. It also has a mosque, a big auditorium, a health complex, 2 bicycle garage, a playground, and two ponds. Notable alumni *M.

The course is designed to provide a bridge between academic study and training in a law firm. It is a one-year, full-time (or two-year, part-time) course, and tuition fees range from ¬£8,000-¬£16,200 a year. A small proportion of students may have their fees and some living expenses paid for by future employers under a training contract. The course is usually taken after a law degree, but a large minority take the course after studying a different subject at university and taking a conversion course called the Graduate Diploma in Law (GDL/CPE). The LPC is regulated through the Law Society of England and Wales and replaced the Law Society‚Äôs Final Examination (LSF) in 1993.The Independent Newspaper, 21 August 1992 Retrieved on 12 September 2015. Like the GDL/CPE, the LPC can be applied to through the Central Applications Board. The LPC is also offered to LLB graduates at some Australian universities, as an alternative to an articled clerkship. In Scotland, the equivalent is the Diploma in Professional Legal Practice.  Course content  The course content can be broadly classified into three phases of learning. These are (a) \\"Core\\" compulsory modules, (b) \\"Elective\\" modules and (c) practical skills. Skills comprise advocacy, interviewing and advising, writing, drafting and research, solicitors' accounts, wills and administration and taxation. Generally taught in the first (and longest) part of the course, the compulsory modules are generally Criminal Litigation, Business Law and Practice, Property Law and Practice, and Civil litigation. In the shorter second part of the course, students select their \\"Elective\\" modules from a list chosen by the providing institution. Topics vary from institution to institution, but those widely available include advanced courses in the compulsory modules, along with: personal injury, family law, employment law, housing law, immigration law, probate and private client, commercial law, welfare law and commercial property law. Some topics recur throughout the teaching of all course topics and can come up in all examinations. These include: professional conduct, restricted activities under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, business accounts and taxation.  Eligibility and length  Different institutions require different grades before accepting candidates onto their course. Institutions will often interview students with third class degrees before accepting them while only some will interview before accepting a candidate with a lower second. The course generally lasts nine months and has substantially less holiday than an undergraduate course. Emphasis is placed on class room teaching alongside independent study.  Prestige of different institutions  LPC providers are rigorously inspected by the Solicitors Regulation Authority, commonly referred to as the SRA with the intention of maintaining high standards throughout the sector. Some providers are notably more expensive than others and will often be able to spend more money on both staff and facilities.  Pass rates  In 2005, a total of 6,554 people passed the LPC, an overall rate of 84%, representing a 3% rise from the previous year. It is possible to sit all LPC exams three times before failing the course. It is necessary to pass all subjects. 9,337 students enrolled on the LPC in 2008/09. Quite a few deferred their exams or dropped out altogether, leaving 7,759 to take the exam; 5,824 of those passed the exams that year (75% of those who entered), just over the number of training contracts on offer (5,809).The Job Market: Solicitors  The Art of Law Training contracts with big firms tend to start recruitment 2 years in advance i.e. 2 years before completion of the LPC.  Funding  The Law Society has a bursary scheme, this is available for some candidates who have already taken the LPC. Upon securing and commencing a training contract the recipient individual gets their fees paid through Law Society funds. It is not uncommon for law firms to provide sponsorship to LPC studentsLPC Sponsorship Retrieved on 14 April 2013. as part of a job offer. Generally sponsorship is only offered by wealthy commercial practices, although a limited number of legal aid sponsorship packages (funded by the Law Society of England and Wales) do exist. Banks do offer preferential bank loans to post-graduate students in employment. This is an expensive option with loans of up to ¬£25,000 being available. Alternatively, information on professional career development loans run by the National Careers ServiceProfessional Career Development loan on gov.uk Retrieved on 14 April 2013. can be found on the National Careers Service website,Professional Career Development loan on National Career Development Loan Retrieved on 14 April 2013. or in Job Centres.  Negative criticism  * Relevancy: The LPC has been criticised by some professionals as being too broad. All students have to take the compulsory subjects detailed above; regardless of whether they want a 'high street' career, or a 'commercial' one. The broad basis of the course could be seen as bringing increased legal awareness to future professionals.http://www.spr-consilio.com/artlpc1.html * Redundant Components: Certain components, such as the Interviewing and Advising skill assessment, have been criticised as being redundant. The Interviewing and Advising skill assessment creates a highly artificial scenario in which a trainee solicitor interviews a client and then proceeds to render impromptu legal advice. This is highly unlikely to occur in practice, if at all, but remains a compulsory component of the course due to antiquated SRA requirements. * Length: The process of becoming a solicitor has been described as, 'lengthy, demanding and academically difficult. The LPC adds an extra year (or 7 months, if one is on an \\"Accelerated\\" course) onto the process of qualifying. * Commercial bias: A further controversy surrounds the fact that commercial legal practices are far more likely to be able to provide financial sponsorship for the LPC, this means that students from disadvantaged backgrounds have a strong financial incentive not to go into legal aid work such as crime, family and civil liberties - as legal aid firms cannot afford to sponsor the LPC. Commentators such as Clare Dyer (journalist at The Guardian) have spoken of a legal aid 'crisis' in regard to trainees.Oops, Looks like we found a bad link  Brennan Center for Justice * Elective element: The elective element of the LPC has been criticised as 'unnecessary' - as it lengthens the course and burdens students with extra costs. The elective element is the part of the course that allows students to specialise in line with their future career. * Number of places: There have been criticisms that the number of places offered each year by LPC Providers massively outstrips the number of vacancies for training contracts (According to the latest Law Society Annual Statistical report there were 5,411 new training contracts registered and just over 8,000 students sitting the LPC). Taking the LPC results for many students in massive debt and no return on investment whatsoever.Young Legal Aid Lawyers  List of course providers  * Anglia Ruskin UniversityAnglia Ruskin University * Birmingham City University * Bournemouth University * BPP Law School, with 8 branches in Birmingham, Bristol, Cambridge, Leeds, Liverpool, London (Holborn and Waterloo)BPP Law School and Manchester * Bristol Law SchoolBristol Law School at UWE * Cardiff Law School (formerly part of the University of Wales) * Central Law Training * City Law School, London * Derby, School of Law and Criminology, Derby * De Montfort University * Inns of Court School of Law * Leeds Beckett University * Liverpool John Moores University * London Metropolitan University * Manchester Metropolitan University * Northumbria University * Nottingham Law School * Southampton Solent UniversitySouthampton Solent University * Staffordshire University * Swansea University (formerly part of the University of Wales) * The University of Law, Birmingham * The University of Law, Bristol * The University of Law, Chester * The University of Law, Manchester * The University of Law, Guildford * The University of Law, London (Bloomsbury and Moorgate) * The University of Law, Leeds * University of Central Lancashire * University of Exeter (will run at the University of Plymouth from September 2006) * University of GlamorganUniversity of Glamorgan * University of Hertfordshire * University of Huddersfield * University of Plymouth * University of SheffieldUniversity of Sheffield * University of West London * University of Westminster * University of Wolverhampton Future of the Legal Practice Course In May 2017, the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) announced the establishment of a new ‚Äúsuper exam‚Äù called the Solicitors Qualifying Examination (SQE), which would gradually replace the LPC and the Graduate Diploma in Law.

It is situated in a deep canyon along the Araxes, on the Iranian side of the border between Iran and Nakhchivan. It was originally built in the ninth century, and was rebuilt during the Safavid era, after being damaged through wars and earthquakes. It is part of the Armenian Monastic Ensembles of Iran, which are inscribed on UNESCO's World Heritage List. thumb thumb History The Saint Stepanos Monastery. Saint Bartholomew the Apostle first founded a church at the site around AD 62, under the reign of the Parthian Empire.A. Bruke, V. Maxwell, I. Shearer, Iran, Lonely Planet, 2012 The first monastery was built in the seventh century, and was later expanded in the 10th century. The monastery was damaged during the wars between the Seljuks and the Byzantine Empire in the 11th and 12th centuries. Following the conquest of the region by the Mongols of Hulagu Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan, in the middle of the 13th century, a peace agreement was signed between the Armenian Church and the Ilkhanate, and the Christians maintained an equable situation. The monastery was restored in the second half of the 13th century, and was completely rebuilt under the leadership of Zachariah in 1330. By the 14th and 15th centuries, the Saint Stepanos Monastery was at the height of its cultural and intellectual influence, producing paintings and illuminated manuscripts in religion, history, and philosophy. In the early 15th century, the new Safavid dynasty protected the Armenians, but the region was at the center of the conflicts with the Ottomans, who invaded Western Armenia in 1513. The monastery gradually declined in the 16th century. Shah Abbas I expelled the inhabitants of the region in 1604, and the monastery was abandoned. After 1650, the Safavids reoccupied the region and the abandoned monastery was restored in the latter part of the 17th century. At the beginning of the 18th century, the region came under the expansion of the Russian Empire. Yerevan was conquered by the Russians in 1827, and per the Treaty of Turkmenchay, the border between Iran and Russia was subsequently established on the Araxes. Consequently, part of the population was forcefully displaced to Russian Armenia. The Qajar rulers continued to protect the Armenians, and encouraged the rebuilding of the Saint Stepanos Monastery between 1819 and 1825. The monastery underwent several restorations in the 20th century.

He is best known for his book Malaysian Spiders, published in 1896, in which he described several new species. Biography Thomas Workman was born at Ceara, Windsor Avenue, Belfast, Ireland on 14 August 1843 into a wealthy family involved in muslin, linen and commerce. He became a successful businessman, at first in the linen trade and then in shipbuilding. He was the elder brother of Frank Workman, born in 1856, who founded the Belfast shipyard of Workman Clark in 1879. Travel In the years 1869 and 1870 Workman travelled in North America spending his time mainly in the West, much with native tribes. His trip journals and accounts of the natural history of the American plains and Native Americans are now in the Public Records Office in Belfast. His collection of North American Indian artefacts is in the Ulster Museum. Each year, when business and family permitted, Workman spent lengthy periods in foreign lands, collecting insects, especially butterflies and spiders. His ethnographic collections are in the Ulster Museum in Belfast. His most significant trips were * 1881 - Brazil * 1883 - India, Burma, Singapore, China and the Philippines * 1888 - Singapore and Ceylon * 1890 - Singapore and Java * 1892 - Ceylon, Singapore and India Societies Workman was, as well as being actively involved in the civic administration of Belfast, the Honorary Librarian of the Belfast Natural History and Philosophical Society becoming president in 1898. He died in St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S.A in 1900, having caught a chill en route from Vancouver following a trip to the Rocky Mountains. Achievements Aside from his work on spiders, especially those of the Far East, Workman was a considerable lepidopterist collecting for Adalbert Seitz and Lionel Walter Rothschild among others. Some of his specimens are figured and noted without attribution in Seitz' monumental Macrolepidoptera of the World. A systematic description of the hitherto known Macrolepidoptera, edited in collaboration with well-known specialists published in Stuttgart by Alfred Kermen.

Historian Jacques Termeau, in La Fl√®che Book No. 9, p. 5-11, has documented several hypotheses which most likely are related to the ancient Latin name Fixa meaning \\"stuck\\", that is to say \\"rock stuck in the ground\\". In fact La Fl√®che was a city situated on the border of Maine and Anjou. An ancient megalith boundary would have given this the name Fixa that can be found in early manuscripts in full as Fixa andegavorum, often translated later as La Fl√®che in Anjou, but more precisely meaning the boundary of Anjou. In the Middle Ages, La Fl√®che was a parish of the Diocese of Angers and as such formed an integral part of the province of Anjou and more specifically the Upper Anjou, also called Maine Angevine. In 1343, salt became a state monopoly by order of King Philip VI of Valois, who established the Gabelle, the tax on salt. The Anjou was among the regions of \\"high salt tax\\" and contained sixteen special tribunals or \\"salt warehouses\\", including La Fleche. La Fl√®che was at the head of Angevine seneschalship under the Old Regime: the Seneschal of La Fl√®che was dependent on the principal Seneschal of Angers. In 1603, Guillaume Fouquet de la Varenne, lord of La Fl√®che and then Sainte-Suzanne (Mayenne) and Angers, and a friend of Henry IV of France, contributed to the enhancement and diversification of functions of the Angevine city. Henry IV founded a college in which management was entrusted to the Jesuits. They were expelled in 1762 and the college became a \\"cadet school\\" in 1764, a pre-military academy of Paris. Also in the seventeenth century, settlers from La Fl√®che, under the leadership of J√©r√¥me le Royer de la Dauversi√®re, founded Montreal, Quebec. In 1790, during the creation of the French departments, the entire northeastern part of the Anjou region, including La Fl√®che, Le Lude and Ch√¢teau-du-Loir, was attached to the new department of Sarthe. On December 8, 1793, during the War in the Vend√©e, the city was stormed by the Vend√©ens at the battle of La Fl√®che. In 1808, Napoleon built the military academy. In 1866, the town of Sainte-Colombe was integrated with La Fl√®che. On 1 January 1965, La Fl√®che absorbed the communes of Saint-Germain-du-Val and Verron.

Urban environment and green spaces Carmes' Park La Fl√®che and the Loire Valley have been certified Cities and Regions of Art and History since 2006. The Parc des Carmes in La Fl√®che has improved the quality of its flowers as part of the town's participation in French Villages and Towns in Bloom rankings, attaining a three flower rating since 1997. The quality of garbage collection in the communes of the La Fl√®che region has been recognized through the 2007 'Qualitri label, a label of the ADEME, which is a first in Sarthe. The city has also put into service municipal vehicles running natural gas. Since July 2008, La Fl√®che, in partnership with the town of Cr√©, has had a regional nature reserve, the first in the Sarthe. This preserves the alluvial marsh area and varied biodiversity present on the reserve that extends over 65 hectares. Parc des Carmes, situated at the foot of the town hall, next to the old gardens of the ch√¢teau of Fouquet de la Varenne, allows visitors to explore and discover a few animals as well as an aviary. This park has some remarkable trees, including Araucaria and a young Ginkgo biloba (\\"the thousand crowns tree\\"). There is also a path from the park to the lakes of Monnerie, along the Loir, under the shade of the trees. Economy The La Fl√®che economy is organized as follows: * 65% commercial, * 22% in industry, * 7% in construction, * 6% in agriculture. The print tradition is still alive in La Fl√®che with the factory Brodard and Taupin (group CPI), a leading European manufacturer of paperback books.

Monuments and historical buildings Civil Heritage=Prytan√©e National Militaire Prytan√©e National Militaire During the 16th century, Fran√ßoise, duchess of Alen√ßon, and grandmother to the future Henry IV established a castle in La Fl√®che, where Antoine de Bourbon, king of Navarre, and his wife Jeanne d'Albret, future parents of Henry IV, resided in 1552. The castle was given to the Jesuits by Henri IV in 1604 to found the \\"Coll√®ge Royal Henry-Le-Grand\\", in order \\"to select and train the best minds of the time\\". In 1764 following the expulsion of the Jesuits the school was transformed by Louis XV and Choiseul into a military institution designed to train young cadets for admission to the √âcole Militaire. The buildings now accommodate one of six military schools in France. The buildings are arranged around three courtyards which are dominated by the imposing stature of the Church of St. Louis (1607). The work followed a plan developed by Louis M√©tezeau with a row of courtyards roughly the same size. The architect was √âtienne Martellange. The work was completed in 1655 with the construction of the gate of honour with the pediment and the bust of Henri IV. Ch√¢teau des Carmelites The castle, now the City Hall, was originally the mid-eleventh-century fortress that defended the river crossing. Jean de Beaugency and his son H√©lie, the future Count of Maine, expanded and strengthened it towards the end of the eleventh century. It was a wooden fortress sitting on an island and spanning two neighboring islands, and was the subject of several sieges in the twelfth century to the fifteenth century. The castle was rebuilt in 1450, and the ruins of the keep of this period are still standing, with marks left by arrows on the drawbridge and battlements. In the seventeenth century, Louis XIII donated it to the Carmelites who had established and transformed the city. The main building and cloister date from this period. During the Revolution, it became private property of the family Bertron Auger who transformed it again. Having become mayor in 1909, he was the victim of a fire in 1919. It was rebuilt with a different style in the years that followed. The castle is now part of the wedding hall of the town of La Fl√®che, and has two temporary exhibition rooms. La Fl√®che Zoo Zoological Park of La Fl√®che Created in 1946 by Jacques Bouillault, a naturalist, it is the oldest private park in France. It includes 1,200 animals of 150 species on . This is the premiere tourist destination of the department of Sarthe, with over 300,000 entries per year. The zoo has participated in the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) since 1989. Many new exhibits are added every year. In 2008 the zoo showed the extremely rare white lions of Kruger, of which there are only 200 specimens in the world. The Pavilion Fouquet de la Varenne Pavillon Fouquet de La Varenne La Fl√®che Fouquet de la Varenne Pavilion is in downtown La Fl√®che. The Pavilion was built in the early seventeenth century. The exterior of the Pavilion may be seen throughout the year; however it is open to visitors only on certain occasions. This pavilion is the only building remaining of the ancient castle of La Fl√®che. The Bruere mill  Nestled in the hollow of the Loir, the mill of the Bruere allows visitors to discover how the force of the river powers a mechanism via a large wheel, producing flour, electricity and refreshing ice blocks. This is the last mill in France to produce ice. Lakes of La Monnerie These vast bodies of water of some fifty hectares are equipped with a bathing area that combines water recreation, fitness and nature discovery. The site of the Monnerie is a mosaic of lakes and meadows situated in a bend of the Loire with a rich biodiversity. Many animal and plant species coexist in these places: herons, reed warbler, coot, hare, ermine, green frog, frog, dragonfly, snail, reed, iris, water crowfoot, and water-plantain make this site a popular place for walkers and naturalists. The preservation of these wetlands helps maintain biodiversity. The lakes are the result of the operation of a gravel pit, and wet meadows. Each winter, over thirty migratory species (e.g. greylag goose, pochard, teal) find shelter here. The hall and the theater of the Halle au Bl√© (nicknamed \\"The Candy Box\\") In the Middle Ages there was already a wooden market hall, while the square held the grain market. The halls were rebuilt twice in the eighteenth century. In 1737, they were built of stone and then expanded in 1772 to establish the town hall. Closed to the public since 1947, it was restored to \\"authenticity\\" in 1998 and was recently renamed as the site of the Corn Exchange. This was rewarded in 2000 by the Rubans du Patrimoine. In 1839, a small Italian theater was added to the first floor. The architect who drew up the plans for the \\"little theater\\" was Pierre-F√©lix Delarue, who also designed many castles in the region in the second half of the nineteenth century. This is his best-known building of La Fl√®che in the sub-prefecture. The decoration of the room and its dome were planned by Adrien-Louis Lusson, an architect and designer, born in La Fleche on August 4, 1788. He entrusted the work to decorative painters for the Royal Academy of Music. This theater has retained much of its original decor, except for the paintings of the false dome, redesigned in 1923. Since March 1999, performances in the cultural season are scheduled by the Entertainment and Arts Carroi. This rare Italian-French structure is open to public tours during the Heritage Days and the summer season. For groups, the tourist office of the La Fl√®che Region organizes tours. The museum and chapel of Providence Discovery of the personal effects of Fran√ßoise Jamin, founder in the early nineteenth century of the Institute of the Daughters of Saint-C≈ìur de Marie, told the story of Providence. The chancel and chapel are a unique in the region, with murals of the nineteenth century. The manor of Blotti√®re Dates from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. It is a former hunting manor of William Fouquet de la Varenne. It can be visited only during the summer. Former Hotel Dieu in La Fl√®che In the Museum of the Hospitallers of H√¥tel-Dieu de Montreal, her namesake city, stands the ancient steps of the Hotel-Dieu in La Fl√®che. J√©r√¥me Le Royer, lord of La Dauversi√®re, installed the first sisters in the hospital \\"Maison Dieu\\" of La Fl√®che in 1636. In 1641, he entrusted the task to Jeanne Mance to build a hospital in New France, in Ville-Marie. In 1659, she returned to France with the first three sister carers for Ville-Marie. A century and a half later, during the French Revolution, the nuns were expelled from La Fl√®che. The place was then converted into police station, court and prison. The staircase of the Hotel Dieu was walled in and forgotten. Only during the demolition and restoration of the old prison in 1953 was the oak staircase rediscovered. The town of La Fl√®che offered it to Montreal as a symbol of the long alliance between the two cities. Over 300 years after the arrival of the sisters in Montreal, the staircase resides in the lobby of the museum of the Hospitallers of the H√¥tel- Dieu de Montreal. The Hotel-Dieu itself is no longer visible today, separated from the former police station, having been turned into housing, and the present court. The old prisons disappeared as they were subsumed into it. Former prisons The first prisons were located in La Fl√®che, in the March√©-au-Bl√©, next to the Pr√©sidial, created in 1595 by Henri IV. At the beginning of the nineteenth century they were moved to the bottom of the dead- end street, St. Thomas, on the premises that had been those of the priory of the same name. The unhealthy state of the prisons was denounced August 7, 1807 by Rocher Desperr√©s, a board member, who was concerned about the detention conditions of detainees. Half a century later, the prisoners were again entitled to complain as they were deprived of water because of the erection of the statue of Henri IV, in Pillory Square, which had involved the removal of water pipes. As no one passed the budget at the town hall, the prisoners remained in this state for several years. On May 30, 1933, a presidential decree abolished 14 prisons including that of La Fl√®che. On June 16 of that year, prisoners were transferred to Le Mans. Between 1937 and 1939, during the Spanish Civil War, the old prison was occupied at various times by Spanish refugees (men, women and children). World War II led to the reopening of the prison to hold political prisoners. The prison was finally abolished in 1953. The door of the priory, in the middle of the dead end street, Saint-Thomas, was removed in early 1958. Religious heritage La Fl√®che, Eglise St Louis (du coll√®ge j√©suite) La Fl√®che has six major religious buildings: * The Church of St. Thomas (early twelfth century and rebuilt in the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries), the main church of the city; * The Church of Sainte- Colombe, freely accessible; * The Church of St. Germain du Val (eleventh and twelfth centuries), freely accessible; * Church Verron, freely accessible; * Chapel of Our Lady of Virtues (no celebrations, but open to the public) is the oldest religious building in the city (Roman times); * The Church of St. Louis is located within the confines of the Prytan√©e National Militaire.

Daulatpur Muhsin High School is the first high school of Khulna District, it is located at Daulatpur, Khulna District, the oldest river port in southern Bengal. The school conducts classes from grade 6 to grade 10 in the science, arts and commerce sections. In 2000, the school had 973 students and 19 teachers, of whom 3 were women. The school has a total of three acres of land and five buildings, of which four are two-storied and other is one- storied. It has two playgrounds. It continues to maintain its tradition of performing well in public examinations.  History  The school was established with the support & great contribution of Hazi Mohammad Mohsin. The greater part of his zamindari estates were in this district. The management office of the Saidpur Trust Estate comprising Saidpur, Shovana and Charbhadra of the district was at Daulatpur. Manager of this estate, Babu Khetragopal Bandyopadhyay, planned the establishment of the school and sought help of the deputy collector, Babu Brahmanath Som, who was also the officer in charge of the estate. The school was established on 2 February 1867. Initially, it was a minor school and was named Daulatpur-Saidpur Trust Estate School. Later, the name was changed to Daulatpur Minor School. Babu Abhayakumar Sen was appointed its first headmaster. In 1870, 13 students from this school appeared in the Medium English Final Examinations and 12 passed. Students of the school continued to perform well in examinations and in recognition, the school was upgraded to a High English School in February 1875. On that time Muslim students were very few in number and management decided to open a Madrasa section. It was well appreciated and good number of Muslim students are attracted to the school. Environment & facilities Govt. Daulatpur Muhsin High School is on total of 3 acres of land. There are four two-storied and one one-storied building as class room, here also a small tin shed hostel for residential support of student. The school conducted classes 6-10 grade. Here Science, Arts and Commerce faculty are available. According to the last education board report the school had 973 students and 19 teachers including 3 were women.

It runs west from Dar es Salaam to Kigoma on Lake Tanganyika via Dodoma. A branch leads to Mwanza on Lake Victoria. In 2017, Tanzania began the Tanzania Standard Gauge Railway project, which will construct a standard gauge (1435 mm) line parallel to the meter-gauge (1000 mm) Central Line between Dar es Salaam and Mwanza, with a new route branching northwest at Isaka to Kigali in Rwanda. History Kidete railway station Kigoma railway station, viewed from the station yard in 2010 =German period= The Central Line was the second railway project coming into existence in the colony of then German East Africa after the Usambara Railway. For the Tanganjikabahn-project a company was founded, the Ostafrikanische Eisenbahngesellschaft (OAEG) (East African Railway Company) which started railway construction in 1905 with 21 million marks (‚Ñ≥) provided by Adolph von Hansemann's Disconto-Gesellschaft (Discounting Company) bank. The building started at the port and capital of that time, Dar es Salaam. From the start the engineers fought large difficulties, the tropical climate, periodic heavy rain and lack of appropriate building material. On the other hand, they could count on the experiences from the previous building of the Usambara Railway. The , meter- gauge, was chosen. The Central Line is the largest technical inheritance of the German colonial age in Tanzania. The route followed an old caravan route to Tabora, which gave large logistic advantages. German settlers soon followed with plantations, and Tabora developed into a large agricultural centre. Kilometer 200 was reached in 1907, in the vicinity of the town of Morogoro. In 1909 the railhead reached Kilosa. Kigoma at Lake Tanganyika at kilometer 1252 was reached in 1914 just prior to the First World War. The regular travel time over the total distance amounted to 58 hours. It was planned to develop the line further to Iringa and to reach Lake Malawi, a project which was stopped due to the war. The construction of the line opened up trade between Lake Tanganyika and the east coast and spurred the growth of the ports at its termini. =British Mandate= The British mandate added to the Central Line three branch lines. The most important one, of , ran from Tabora to Mwanza at the south bank of the Lake Victoria. Another ran from Kilosa to Mikumi. A third, established in 1931, ran from Manyoni to Kiniyangiri; this had been shut down by 1948. =After independence= After the independence of Tanzania, the Central Line and the Usambara Railway were connected between the stations of Mruazi and Ruvu. The Main Line The Central Line starts at the Tanzanian metropolis of Dar es Salaam at the Indian Ocean with today's capital of Tanzania, Dodoma, in the center of the country and proceeds further to Tanzania‚Äôs most important port at the shore of Lake Tanganyika, Kigoma. It crosses central Tanzania completely with a length of and overcomes the height of the east edge East African rift valley. The main stations on this line are: Dar es Salaam, Ruvu, Morogoro, Kilosa, Dodoma, Manyoni, Tabora and Kaliua. =Mwanza Line= Mwanza Train Station as seen from the main road in the centre of Mwanza town. The Mwanza Railway line connects with the main line at Tabora station and ends at Mwanza railway station. The distance covered by this railway line is 378 km. Its construction started at Tabora in 1923 and ended in Mwanza in 1928. A dry port was constructed at the town of Isaka, for freight transport to Rwanda and Burundi. The main stations along the Mwanza Railway line are: Tabora, Kakola, Isaka, Shinyanga and Mwanza. =Mikumi line= The Mikumi line, built between 1958 and 1963, branches southwards off the Central Line at Kilosa and crosses the Mkata Plain to Kidatu, where it meets the 1,067 mm gauge TAZARA Railway at a break-of-gauge. Traffic Passenger train in the main station of Dar es Salaam Today‚Äôs railservices are offered by the Tanzania Railways Corporation. The timetable offers three passenger services per week in each direction covering the whole length of the line. A trip from Dar es Salam to Kigoma takes approximately 40 hours today according to the timetable. The long time of travel is due to the poor state of the railway‚Äôs infrastructure, which originates to a large extent still from the German colonial times. Three classes are offered, whereby the second class also provides sleeping cars and the first class offers sleeping cars only. The standard of a sleeping car of second class corresponds rather to a couchette by European standards. Flooding in December 2009 caused serious disruption; operations resumed in June 2010.

It is commonly referred to as the Vank (; ), which means \\"monastery\\" or \\"convent\\" in the Armenian language. History The cathedral was established in 1606, built by the hundreds of thousands of Armenians that were forcibly resettled by Shah Abbas I in his new capital as part of his scorched-earth policy in Armenia during the Ottoman War of 1603-1618.David Blow. \\"Shah Abbas: The Ruthless King who Became an Iranian Legend\\" I.B. Tauris. (original from the University of Michigan) p 200 The varying fortunes and independence of this suburb across the Zayande River and its eclectic mix of European missionaries, mercenaries and travelers can be traced almost chronologically in the cathedral's combination of building styles and contrasts in its external and internal architectural treatment. Construction The construction is believed to have begun in 1606 by the first arrivals, and completed with major alterations to design between 1655 and 1664 under the supervision of Archbishop David. The cathedral consists of a domed sanctuary, much like an Iranian mosque, but with the significant addition of a semi-octagonal apse and raised chancel usually seen in western churches. The cathedral's exteriors are in relatively modern brickwork and are exceptionally plain compared to its elaborately decorated interior. Frescos The interior is covered with fine frescos and gilded carvings and includes a wainscot of rich tile work. The delicately blue and gold painted central dome depicts the Biblical story of the creation of the world and man's expulsion from Eden. Pendentives throughout the church are painted with a motif of a cherub's head surrounded by folded wings typical of Armenian art. The ceiling above the entrance is painted with delicate floral motifs in the style of Persian miniature. Two sections, or bands, of murals run around the interior walls: the top section depicts events from the life of Jesus, while the bottom section depicts tortures inflicted upon Armenian martyrs by the Ottoman Empire.

Nine people, all members of James Peterson's family, were shot in the head by a man who was later called \\"Canada's worst random mass murderer\\".‚ÄúCanada's 'worst random mass murderer' dies,‚Äù Regina Leader-Post, May 22, 2004. Events Victor Hoffman was 21 years old at the time and had been released from a mental hospital just three weeks before the murders. On the morning of August 15, he entered the Petersons' farm armed with a .22-calibre Browning pump- action repeater rifle. He then proceeded to shoot all but one of the members of the Peterson family, seven of them children, at close range around the four-room house. According to police, 28 shots were fired in total, of which 27 found their target. Mr. Peterson was shot in the kitchen, while his wife Evelyn and her one-year-old baby were found in the backyard. The other six children were shot while sleeping in their bedrooms. Their ages ranged from 2 to 17 years old. Phyllis Peterson, then 4 years old, was the lone survivor of the massacre. She was sleeping under the bedclothes between her two sisters and was not noticed by Hoffman. However, Hoffman later declared that he spared her because \\"she had the face of an angel.\\"‚Äú 'Shell Lake massacre' killer dies; The Toronto Star, May 22, 2004. The bodies were found by Wildrew Lang who was to help Mr. Peterson with farm duties later that morning. He had to travel 6 km (3.7 mi) to the next telephone post before he could report the incident to the police. The police immediately started an extensive manhunt on the surroundings of the house. Victims * James Peterson, age 47 * Evelyn Peterson, 42 * Jean Peterson, 17 * Mary Peterson, 13 * Dorothy Peterson, 11 * Pearl Peterson, 9 * William Peterson, 5 * Colin Peterson, 2 * Larry Peterson, 1 The Peterson's oldest daughter, Kathy Peterson Hill (then age 19 or 20) was married and living in British Columbia at the time of the murders. She moved back to the Peterson farm and took custody of her youngest sister. Aftermath On August 19, 1967, Hoffman was arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police without putting up resistance. He was found at his parents' home in Leask, about 65 km (40 mi) southwest of Shell Lake. After his arrest he told the police that he had fought the devil before the murders and described him as being \\"tall, black and having no genitals.\\" He was remanded to a mental hospital in North Battleford where he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Hoffman was found not guilty by reason of insanity on non- capital murder charges in February 1968. During the trial Crown prosecutor Serge Kujawa called Hoffman \\"the craziest man in Saskatchewan.\\" He was put under the custody of the provincial Health Ministry and sent to a mental institution. He remained most of the time in an Ontario-based institution until December 2001, when he was granted supervised access to the towns of Penetanguishene, Port McNicoll and Midland in Ontario. This decision was not without controversy since the hospital was only required to inform the local police of Hoffman's release. Canadian journalist Peter Tadman wrote a book about the murders in 1992 and had the chance to interview Hoffman several times. According to Tadman, Hoffman felt no guilt about the murders and reported that he still saw the devil that compelled him to commit them. Hoffman died of cancer under custody on May 21, 2004. In popular culture Manitoba country musician Irvin Freese took an interest in the event, writing and recording \\"The Shell Lake Disaster\\" which was released as a 45 on Winnipeg's Eagle Records label (ER-128) within a month of the event (September 1967). Lawyers threatened the label with a lawsuit, and the 45 was rapidly recalled. This rarity has recently been released on \\"The Best Of Eagle Records\\" on the Super Oldies label (2009).

Trace gas molecules are ionized by the production and flow of thermalized hydrated hydronium cluster ions in a plasma afterglow of helium or argon carrier gas along a flow tube following the introduction of a humid air sample. These ions react in multiple collisions with water molecules, their isotopic compositions reach equilibrium and the relative magnitudes of their isotopomers are measured by mass spectrometry. Brief History Over the years many variations of the instrument have been made. In the beginning during the 1960s there was the study of flowing afterglow plasma. This study was done by Eldon Ferguson, Art Schmeltekopf and Fred Fehsenfeld at National Bureau of Standards in Boulder, Colorado. Then in the 1970s it was flowing drift tube, flowing afterglow Langmuir probe (FALP), and variable temperature flowing afterglow Langmuir probe (VT-FLAP). With the addition of the drift tube the kinetics of a reaction could be studied in the gas phase. With the flowing afterglow Langmuir probe the electron density within the reaction region of the drift tube can be studied. With the VT-FLAP version of flowing afterglow the reactions temperature dependence could be studied. Now in the 2000s the ambient version of flowing afterglow mass spectrometry is flowing atmospheric pressure afterglow mass spectrometry (FAPA-MS).The FAPA allows for simple or no sample preparations but the humidity of the instrument's environment may have an effect on an sample fragmentation pattern. Since the cost of helium is steady rising some have started to use alternative methods with ambient flowing afterglow to conserve resources. Instead of using continuously flowing afterglow helium some use interrupted helium flow to conserve gas and Schlieren imaging to maximize the molecular ions produced and the instrument step-up.  Application(s) Trace gas analysis= One of the first papers reporting the use of the flowing afterglow studied ion-molecule reactions pertinent to the Martian atmosphere. This flowing afterglow technique replaced the then standard stationary afterglow when the movable Langmuir probe was introduced. The flowing afterglow has many attractive aspects: well-understood laminar behavior, viscous gas flow, a large density of carrier gas which allows the study of thermalized reactions, and the capability to make new reactant ions in situ. The ambipolar plasma is sampled using a nosecone and detected using conventional quadrupole or tandem mass spectrometry, depending on the application. One of the drawbacks of the flowing afterglow technique is the possibility of generating multiple reactant ions. This problem is circumvented by implementing the selected ion flow tube (SIFT). The flowing afterglow technique can be used to identify and quantify the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of a sample as long as the fundamental ion chemistry is known. The commonly used ions are H3O+, O2+*, and NO+. All ions have drawbacks and advantages. Strategies that have been employed to identify the VOCs include using gas chromatography coupled with flowing afterglow and using a complement of reagent ions. Also in addition to being able to detect volatile organic compounds, the flowing afterglow technique has also been used to study chronic kidney disease. Studies have been done to create a spectrum of deuterium water and its isotopes to measure total body water, which can be used to determine the water body overload of a patient. That measurement will then be used to determine the stage of renal failure for a patient. See also *Charles H. DePuy (chemist) *Robert R.

It is the principal practice of the Subud organization. Origin The origin of the practice is associated with Javanese \\"kebatinan\\" or \\"kejawen\\" tradition. The practice Latihan kejiwaan (or simply latihan) means \\"spiritual exercise\\" or \\"training of the spirit\\". This exercise is not thought about, learned or trained for; it is unique for each person and the ability to 'receive' it is passed on by being in the presence of another person who already practises it at the 'opening'. About twice a week, Subud members go to a local center to participate in a group latihan, men and women separately. The experience takes place in a room or a hall with open space. After a period of sitting quietly, the members are typically asked to stand and relax by a 'helper', who then announces the start of the exercise. Practitioners are advised to surrender to 'what arises from within', not expecting anything in advance. One is recommended not to focus on any image or recite any mantra, nor to mix the exercise with other activities like meditation or use of drugs, but simply to intend to surrender to the Divine or the will of God. (The term \\"God\\" is used here with a broad and inclusive intention. An individual is at liberty to substitute interpretations that they feel more in tune with.) One is not to pay attention to others in the room, each of whom is doing his or her own latihan. During the exercise, practitioners may find that, in terms of physical and emotional expression, they involuntarily move, make sounds, walk around, dance, jump, skip, laugh, cry or whatever. The experience varies greatly for different people, but the practitioner is always wholly conscious throughout and free to stop the exercise at any time. Outwardly the exercise often manifests as physical movement and vocal activity that vary greatly both over time and between individuals. It proceeds spontaneously, involving neither teacher nor method, being unstructured except for basic rules relating to group practice. The capacity to engage in latihan the first time, in what is called the \\"opening\\", is said to be transmitted by the presence of experienced practitioners. It usually entails an attitude of patience and trust, typically with some preparatory relaxation of thoughts and feelings, and involves the whole human being, not just body, emotions, mind or any other single facet. It is regarded by practitioners as being of spiritual or psychological benefit, depending on personal interpretation and individual experience though apparently it does not affect all practitioners and may affect some detrimentally. Many practitioners see latihan as a way of direct access to a mystical experience that is compatible with a busy modern lifestyle. The Tantra educator Laurie Handlers uses her own variety of Latihan in her workshops of sexual exploration. =Use in Subud= While the opinions of Subud's founder are often cited among its members, the organization officially endorses no doctrine regarding the latihan's nature or benefits. Practitioners tend to agree that the exercise is best experienced with minimal theorizing or mental imagery. Although latihan can be practiced alone, Subud arranges regular practice in group settings. Normally sessions are held two or three times a week and last thirty minutes, with the two sexes segregated. Subud offers formal pragmatic, preliminary advice in relation to commencing the practice. Non-members are not allowed to witness Subud latihan sessions as they are considered private. Subud's founder speculated that the spontaneous movements which characterise latihan are similar in character to early meetings of the Religious Society of Friends which gave rise to the name Quakers. Active meditation The method was later adopted by Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh), who made use of many spiritual methods. He viewed latihan as potentially beneficial, capable of cleansing the mind, yet incomplete and potentially dangerous to mental health since it involved surrender of self-control. He therefore incorporated it as a stage of longer \\"active meditations\\", advocating the maintenance of a \\"witnessing consciousness\\", following latihan with a period of complete rest and preceding it with one of several techniques intended to promote an autohypnotic trance, and further recommended that, when practising in groups, both sexes should practise together. Preliminary methods used include listening to quiet music,http://www.oshoteachings.com/osho- devavani-meditation-osho-devavani-active-meditation/ or else a breathing exercise intended to increase blood carbon dioxide levels followed by fifteen minutes looking at a strobe light while listening to music, both of these running at seven times the rate of the heart-beat in order to create an entrainment to alpha wave brain-state.

It has a size of 13,4 km¬≤ and preserves a peat bog that has remained partly untouched by peat cutting, which used to be extensive in the area. It is one of the most bird-rich areas in Western Europe, with resident black- necked grebes and sometimes migrating common cranes in October/November. The terrain is varied with inaccessible peat swamps, lakes, heath land and sand ridges. The present swamp and some of the lakes were created by the cutting of peat. There is a 3 km-long route guided by red poles with a tower that provides visitors with a view of the wasteland. Care must be taken if leaving the assigned route. The swamps can be treacherous. History of the park A lonesome birch tree in the heath next to a track. De Groote Peel National Park is one of the last, largely raised bogs that remains uncultivated. De Groote Peel offers a varied landscape of inaccessible peat swamp, lakes, open moorland areas, plains and sand ridges with purple moor. The current landscape of the Groote Peel was created by the excavation of peat. This excavation at some places created large lakes in the marshy landscape. Around the mid 20th century ridges of trees were planted. The damp and quiet nature make the area attractive to birds. De Groote Peel is one of the richest bird areas in Western Europe. The area has a special vegetation of many rare species. It has been made accessible to visitors through the construction of raised trackways over the extensive swamp areas.

Retrieved 2 June 2016. The College of Law had been incorporated by royal charter as a charity in 1975, but in 2012, prior to the granting of university status, its educational and training business was split off and incorporated as a private limited company. This became The College of Law Limited and later The University of Law Limited. The charitable branch, which remained incorporated by the 1975 royal charter, became the Legal Education Foundation. Shortly after the granting of university status and being renamed The University of Law in 2012, The College of Law Limited was bought by Montagu Private Equity. Three years later, Montagu sold the company to its present owner, the Netherlands-based company Global University Systems. The university has nine campuses in the UK in Birmingham, Bristol, Chester, Guildford, Leeds, London (Bloomsbury and Moorgate), Manchester, and Nottingham, and an international branch in Hong Kong. In 2019, the university received a Silver rating in the UK government's Teaching Excellence Framework. History20th century= The Law Society of England and Wales created The College of Law in 1962 by merging its own solicitors' training school with the tutorial firm Gibson and Weldon.Jackson, Richard Meredith and Spencer, J. R. (1989). Jackson's Machinery of Justice, p. 346. Cambridge University Press. The college was created in its legal form by Royal Charter on 5 December 1975. It was registered as a charity on 24 May 1976, with the aim \\"to promote the advancement of legal education and the study of law in all its branches\\". Until the transfer of its training business to The College of Law Limited in 2012, The College of Law was in the top 100 of UK charities ranked by expenditure. Coat of arms of the former College of Law Following the recommendations of the Ormrod Report on the reform of legal education in England and Wales, The Law Society submitted proposals in 1975 for a 36-week Final Examination course for aspiring solicitors and a Common Professional Examination (CPE) or law conversion course for non-law graduates to be taught at The College of Law. The first CPE was held in 1978. The number of institutions approved to deliver the CPE gradually increased until by 2006 the BPP Law School and 27 universities, most of them former polytechnics, were also running the course.Institute of Advanced Legal Studies Library.

In the 1980s, The Law Society asked the college to produce a scheme for additional tuition in accounts for articled clerks (now trainee solicitors), combining distance learning with one-day's attendance at lectures. Further distance learning courses were developed in a partnership with the Open University beginning in 1998. The Guildford campus of the college also established the Fresh Start distance learning course for solicitors returning to practice after a career break or those wishing to change their specialisation.(1996). Returning to Work: A Directory of Education and Training for Women, p. 17. Sage. The 1990s saw a change in the relationship between The Law Society and The College of Law. In 1994, Nigel Savage, then the dean of Nottingham Trent University's law school, called for a review of the link between the college and The Law Society which had eight of its council members on the college's board of governors. Savage suggested that this gave the college an unfair advantage in recruiting students to the Legal Practice Course which had been set up The Law Society in 1993 to replace the Final Examination course. The society also regulated the course and determined which institutions would receive a licence to deliver it. He proposed that the college should either \\"come clean\\" about the relationship and declare itself the official college of The Law Society or sever the link and become completely independent.Times Higher Education Supplement (27 January 1995). \\"Row over College of Law tie\\". The college subsequently severed the link, and The Law Society stopped appointing college governors. Savage went on to become the president and CEO of The College of Law in 1996 and served in that capacity for the next 18 years.Abel, Richard L. (2003).

The College of Law Limited was created as a private limited company to take on its educational and training business. The parent charity changed its name to the Legal Education Foundation.

The Law Society Gazette On 22 November 2012, it was announced that the college had been granted full university status and its name would be changed to \\"The University of Law\\". Shortly thereafter, Montague Private Equity completed the acquisition process. This raised questions about the legality of transferring the degree-awarding powers granted under royal charter to the original College of Law to the newly created company, and then selling that company, now with university status, to a for-profit provider. The UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills explained that while degree-awarding powers cannot be transferred, when a whole institute changes its legal status, the powers remain with it. This was considered to be the case with The University of Law because all of the original College of Law's education and training business had been transferred to the for-profit college, and the activities remaining with the chartered body were not related to the degree-awarding powers.

Platform 1 - Services heading towards Bristol Temple Meads from Bristol Parkway Platform 2 - Services heading towards Bristol Parkway from Bristol Temple Meads Platform 3 - Services heading towards Bristol Temple Meads from Cardiff Central Platform 4 - Services heading towards Cardiff Central from Bristol Temple Meads  History  There have been three different stations in the area of Filton Abbey Wood. The first, Filton, opened in 1863 just north the site of the current Filton Abbey Wood, and was closed in 1903. A second station was opened a few hundred yards to the north, and was known as Filton Junction. This station closed in 1996, replaced by Filton Abbey Wood.\\"Filton station closes\\" Rail issue 289 9 October 1996 page 6 = First station: Filton = The first station at Filton opened on 8 September 1863 when services began on the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway (BSWUR), which ran from to , north of Bristol on the banks of the River Severn. At New Passage, passengers were transferred to a ferry to cross the Severn to continue on into Wales. The line, engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was built as single track broad gauge, with a platform on the western side of the line. The station was situated in the county of Gloucestershire, from Bristol Temple Meads and immediately south of the modern bridge over the A4174 Avon Ring Road. The BSWUR was amalgamated with the Great Western Railway, who had from the beginning operated all BSWUR services, in 1868; and in 1873 the line was converted to standard gauge. Although the line made travel from Bristol to Wales easier, the change from train to ferry to train was inconvenient, and so a tunnel was built under the River Severn. To cope with the anticipated increase in demand, the line through Filton was doubled, with a new platform built on the eastern side of the new track, complete with waiting room. The new track was first used on 1 September 1886 when the Severn Tunnel opened. The station continued in use until 1 July 1903, when it was closed and replaced by a new station further north. There is no trace remaining of the original station. = Second station: Filton Junction = A train for Wales passes through Filton Junction in 1962.

Filton Junction railway station in 1992, after the demolition of the buildings. The station as it stands today, seen from a passing train. In 1900, almost all trains from London to Wales travelled via Bath and Bristol, with some still routed via . However, the final to Bristol were relatively slow and congested, so a new route was built further north, the GWR's Badminton Line, now part of the South Wales Main Line, running from Wootton Bassett Junction to . The new line opened in 1903, and allowed faster services to Wales. There was a new triangular junction between Patchway and Filton, with the new line coming in from the east. The new station, opened on 1 July 1903, was on an embankment at the southern apex of the junction, just north of the present A4174. It was north of the first station, from Bristol Temple Meads and from London Paddington via the new line. The new station had four platform faces - two outer platforms, and two inner platforms sharing an island between the southbound line from Patchway and the westbound line to London. The western platforms served trains between Bristol and Wales, while the eastern platforms served trains on the new line. The platforms were linked by a subway which led to the booking office, situated on ground level by the main entrance on the east side of the station. The approach road led south from the main entrance, towards the A4174. There were waiting rooms and large canopies on each of the platforms. There were goods facilities to the south of the road, on the west side of the line and covering the site of the first station. There was a goods shed with a loading platform on a passing loop, as well as a north-facing covered loading platform and a south-facing siding. An additional south-facing siding for coal traffic was added after the First World War. Opposite the goods yard was Filton Junction Signal Box, which controlled the junction and by 1948 had more than 70 levers. Following the opening of the Henbury Loop Line, which diverged from the line towards Wales to the north, the station was renamed Filton Junction on 1 May 1910. Trains on this line used the western platforms, and often operated loop services to and from Bristol Temple Meads via . From 1928, trains could also run loop services via Clifton Down, and . As well as being useful for passengers changing trains (due to its junction status), Filton Junction was also used by workers at the nearby Filton Aerodrome and the attendant aircraft works. When the railways were nationalised in 1948, Filton Junction came under the aegis of the Western Region of British Railways. Following the publication of the Beeching Report, the Henbury Line was closed to passengers in 1964, and service levels began to decline. The line between and Severn Beach was also closed, putting an end to loop services. The goods yard was closed in July 1965, and the station's name reverted to Filton from 6 May 1968. Much of the station buildings were demolished in 1976, as were the platforms serving Badminton Line trains, as no trains on this line called at Filton anymore. The remaining two platforms had small replacement shelters built on them. In 1974, when the Local Government Act 1972 came into effect, the southern part of Gloucestershire, including the district of Filton, became part of the new county of Avon. British Rail was split into business-led sectors in the 1980s, at which time operations at Filton passed to Regional Railways. In the 1990s, plans were made to build a new station in Filton and close the 1903 station. The last train called on 8 March 1996, with services moving to the new Filton Abbey Wood from 11 March, with two intervening days of no service due to a closure of the Severn Tunnel. The remains of Filton Junction can still be seen from passing trains, and the two western platforms are still present, albeit overgrown. The subway has been blocked off, and the access road is now a residential street called \\"The Sidings\\". = Third station: Filton Abbey Wood = Snowy conditions in 2010, showing the three platforms, with the newest platform on the right. Filton Abbey Wood was constructed for ease of access of workers at MoD Abbey Wood, which is next to the station. Platform 4 which was added in 2018 In the early 1990s, the Ministry of Defence procurement division was consolidated into a major office development in Filton, known as MoD Abbey Wood. As part of this development, a new station was built in Filton, primarily to serve the MoD workers. Construction began in 1995, and cost ¬£1,400,000. The station, named Filton Abbey Wood, was opened to the public on 11 March 1996 and officially opened on 19 March by Minister for Transport Steven Norris MP and the Chair of Avon County Council. Shortly after the station was opened, the county of Avon was disbanded, with the Filton region now governed by South Gloucestershire council. The new station was situated south of the first Filton station, and south of Filton Junction. There were two platforms, each long, separated by two running lines. A ramped footbridge connected the platforms at the north end, and each platform had ground-level access from the sides: the eastern, southbound platform from MoD Abbey Wood; the western, northbound platform via a footpath from the car park to the north. There were metal and glass shelters on each platform and a small, rarely used booking office on the southbound platform. Initial services at the station included local stopping services from Bristol to South Wales, and services between and . Services towards Bath were of particular importance to the MoD, as many of their staff had been based there prior to the construction of MoD Abbey Wood. South Gloucestershire council provided a subsidy for half-hourly services to Bath. The station proved popular with MoD workers, local residents commuting into central Bristol, and also students and staff at the University of the West of England. When the railway was privatised in 1997, local services were franchised to Wales & West, which was succeeded by Wessex Trains in 2001. The line through Filton closed for two weeks in June 2004 to enable the construction of a new platform and third running line on the west side of the station, separating trains towards Bristol Parkway from trains towards Wales before the station, and so allowing through-trains to pass stopping trains. The project cost ¬£16 million, and caused the complete suspension of Severn Beach Line services to allow longer-distance services to use it as a diversion. The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and responsibility passed to First Great Western which was subsequently rebranded as Great Western Railway in 2015. First introduced new services between and , and between and , each calling at Filton Abbey Wood. From December 2006, Virgin CrossCountry began operating a single daily service Newcastle to Cardiff Central via Bristol Temple Meads and Filton Abbey Wood. This service was taken over by Arriva CrossCountry when the CrossCountry franchise changed hands in 2007, and then replaced by a daily service each direction between Cardiff Central and . A three-week closure of the line and station in late October & early/mid November 2018 saw all trains replaced by buses between Bristol Parkway and Bristol Temple Meads and on the Severn Beach branch whilst the four track layout between Dr Day's Junction and Filton Junction was reinstated, also bringing a new fourth platform at Filton Abbey Wood into use and short extensions to the southern ends of the other three platforms to fully accommodate 5 carriage 23 metre vehicle trains.  Future  First Great Western declined a contractual option to continue the Greater Western franchise beyond 2013, citing a desire for a longer-term contract due to the impending upgrade to the Great Western Main Line. The franchise was put out to tender, but the process was halted and later scrapped due to the fallout from the collapse of the InterCity West Coast franchise competition. A two-year franchise extension until September 2015 was agreed in October 2013, and subsequently extended until March 2019. The CrossCountry franchise is also due to expire in 2019. The line through Filton Abbey Wood was due to have been electrified by 2017 as part of the Great Western Main Line electrification project, however this has been postponed indefinitely. The Cross Country Route, the Bristol to Exeter line and the Heart of Wessex Line were not set to be electrified, so services at Filton Abbey Wood would still have been provided by diesel trains; however many \\"Sprinter\\" units have been replaced by and \\"Turbo\\" units. The group Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways supports the electrification continuing beyond the main lines, as does MP for Weston-super- Mare John Penrose. The electrification scheme also included the four-tracking of the line through Filton to allow more services between and and to separate fast inter-city services from local stopping services, which was completed in November 2018. A fourth platform has been added in November 2018 as part of the project.\\"NR agrees ¬£33m contract for Bristol four-tracking\\" Rail issue 761 12 November 2014 page 24\\"Preparations continue for Bristol resignalling\\" Rail issue 848 14 March 2018 page 29 Filton Abbey Wood is on the / corridor, one of the main axes of the Greater Bristol Metro, a rail transport plan which aims to enhance transport capacity in the Bristol area.

Hadi (12 August 1899 ‚Äì 14 July 1971) was one of the most gifted pioneering athletes of India. He not only represented India in cricket and tennis, but was also proficient in field hockey, soccer, table tennis, chess, and polo. He was nicknamed \\"Rainbow Hadi\\" because of his expertise in these seven sports. Early years Hadi's father, Captain Syed Mohammed, was an officer in the Paigah army in Hyderabad State and died when Hadi was barely two years old. He was supported by the family of, Sir Asman Jah, the former Prime Minister of Hyderabad State, in the court of the Nizam of Hyderabad. He was raised alongside, Asman Jah's son Nawab Moin-Ud-Dowlah, who would become a leading patron of sports in Hyderabad. Hadi learned horse riding and polo as a youth and played soccer for Nizam College. Recognizing their ward's exceptional athletic abilities, Asman Jah's family helped arrange for his studies in England. Tennis career  As a tennis player Hadi burst on to the international scene while studying at Cambridge University where he studied at Peterhouse and worked hard to become a Cambridge Blue. He helped the Cambridge team score a series of victories against Oxford University and visiting American teams. He also earned university colours in field hockey, soccer, and table tennis. Denied the captaincy of the Cambridge team because he was an Indian, he vindicated his claim by representing India at the Davis Cup in 1924 and 1925. He also represented India at Wimbledon for five years and in 1926 reached the quarterfinals in doubles. He was one of the first Indians to compete as a tennis player at the Olympics (1924 Summer Olympics).S M Hadi at Sports Reference  Cricketer  As a cricketer he played several first-class cricket matches for Hyderabad. When the Ranji Trophy was instituted in 1934, Hadi became the first batsman to score a century. He was also on the Indian team in 1936 when they played an \\"unofficial Test match\\" against the Australians led by Jack Ryder. He continued to play for the Hyderabad XI in the Ranji Trophy till 1941. Many of his siblings were also accomplished sportsmen. His brothers Hussein Mohammad and Ashgar Ali were first class cricketers. Sports and public service  In 1939-40 Hadi along with his brother Col. Ali Raza, Nawab Mahmood Yar Jung, S.A. Rahim and Ahmed Mohiuddin was one of the founding members of the Hyderabad Football Association and the Hyderabad Cricket Association. After retiring from athletics, Hadi continued his involvement in sports as an educator. He had an MA from Cambridge and a Masters from the University of Pennsylvania. Hadi was the Director of Physical Education in Hyderabad and ultimately became Joint Secretary of Education in the Indian Government. Another brother Syed Ali Akbar was also a prominent educator of Hyderabad. Hadi was an avid supporter of the Scout Movement and received the Wood Badge. He was the National Commissioner of the Boy Scouts of India. When the All-India Council of Sports was formed in 1959 he became its first secretary.  Legacy  Hadi died in his native Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, of lung cancer at the age of 72. In an obituary published on 3 September 1971 the Indian Express wrote - \\"It is but given to a few and seldom to shine in so many sports.\\" The man who adopted him, Nawab Moin-Ud-Dowlah, was also a great patron of cricket in India.

KIIS 1065 is one of the flagship stations on the Australian Radio Network's KIIS Network. The station's headline show is The Kyle and Jackie O Show. History2UW= July 1938: Children who entered an adventure story competition on 2UW receive Malvern Star bicycles from champion cyclist Hubert Opperman (extreme right) The station, now known as KIIS, began life as 2UW, commencing transmission on 13 February 1925 on 1125 kHz on the AM band. On 1 September 1935, the frequency changed to 1110 kHz and in 1978 changed again to 1107 kHz. 2UW was the home of many live radio plays and had studios for live programmes at Market Street in Sydney, near the intersection with George Street. The management of 2UW moved the station to 365 Kent Street Sydney although for a time they retained the Market Street live audience theatre that had been used for live plays. One of its early breakfast presenters, Russ Walkington, had a character known as Gerald the Grasshopper who pre-dated Sammy Sparrow who appeared on 2UE with Gary O'Callaghan. In 1935 it became the first radio station outside the United States (and thus the first in both the British Empire and the Southern Hemisphere) to broadcast 24 hours a day.Carty, Bruce On the Air: Australian Radio History, privately published Gosford N.S.W., 2013 During the 1940s and 1950s the format spread throughout the country and by the end of the 1960s, almost all commercial radio stations in Australia were broadcasting day-round. From the early 1960s, 2UW moved away from its older audience and actively pursued the youth market through the introduction of a Top 40 format in response to the music coming from the United States and Great Britain and to provide a vehicle for the up-and-coming Australian local rock scene. 2UW was one of the most innovative AM radio stations in Australia during the mid-1960s through to the early 1970s thanks to the programming of Ray Bean. Ray introduced the NEW2UW (spoken as \\"new U-W\\") '1110' men comprising announcers John Melouney (breakfast), John Thompson (morning), Tony McLaren (afternoon), Ward \\"Pally\\" Austin (drive time), Rod Christopher (early evening), and Jeff Hall (late nights and Dial A Hit on Saturday nights). They were later joined by 'Baby' John Burgess, Donnie Sutherland, Phil Hunter, Gary Stewart, Graham Sawyer and a range of others who took Top 40 radio to a new level as part of the NEW2UW format being broadcast from the Kent Street studios in Sydney. The '1110 men' also took their music to the streets with promotions in such places as beaches, parks and shopping centres. One of the most successful promotions was the NEW2UW studio at the Sydney Royal Easter Show at the old RAS showgrounds at Moore Park. This provided a unique opportunity for the radio stations stars to mingle with their listeners. In 1969 the NEW2UW managed to lure announcer John Laws from his drive time slot at 2UE and gave Laws his first morning programme in Sydney radio which was an immediate success, but also brought much confusion to the audience as the radio station went through a series of breakfast announcers and format changes which sought to capitalise on the success of the John Laws programme, while trying to hang on its huge audience - many of whom were not ready for the introduction of talk-back radio by their beloved NEW2UW. The NEW2UW had a close association with the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph and operated a news service from its own Kent Street studios and a news studio in the Daily Telegraph Building in Park Street Sydney when the Telegraph papers were owned by Sir Frank Packer. The NEW2UW newsroom was operated by Don Rodgers a newspaper journalist who served Prime Ministers Chifley and Curtin during the Second World War as their press secretary. Don's style was very much in the mould of newspaper reporting, but he instilled in his staff the fundamentals of accuracy and clarity in their reporting. =Mix 106.5= 2UW was one of two Sydney AM radio stations to be successful in bidding for the right to convert to FM, and on 30 April 1994 commenced transmission on 106.5 MHz on the FM band. The familiar 2UW call sign was now broadcasting as Mix 106.5, adopting its name and logo from WWMX in the United States. The official callsign became 2WFM, though this was not used on- air. The 1107 kHz frequency is now assigned to SBS Radio. The new station was positioned as \\"Sydney's Best Mix from the '70s, '80s and '90s\\" with an adult contemporary music format. In 2000 the station dropped 70's music from its playlist. The only announcer to remain at the station through 2UW's relaunches, and the subsequent FM conversion, was Trevor Sinclair. Sinclair departed the station in 2001. A further relaunch of the station took place in 2004, with parent company Australian Radio Network consolidating branding across its Mix Network of stations. In conjunction with new programming and aiming to attract a younger demographic, the station adopted the positioner \\"Sydney. Feel Good\\". In 2010, Mix 106.5 went with a revamp of the station in conjunction with new shows and music demographic. Among those changes was the new slogan \\"Sydney's Fresh Mix\\". Having limited success in 2010, by 20 December the station had revived its position to \\"Sydney's Best Mix of the '80s, '90s and Now\\", with the return of Love Songs during the day. On 30 January 2013, the station again revamped with a new programming line-up. Breakfast was presented by Sami Lukis and Yumi Stynes, with Tim 'Rosso' Ross presenting a drive show networked to Mix 101.1 Melbourne. In November 2013, The Kyle & Jackie O Show departed the breakfast timeslot at rival station 2Day FM. Australian Radio Network (ARN) quickly announced that show would be moving to \\"a whole new radio station\\" on 106.5FM in 2014. With the announcement came speculation that the station would be rebranded as KIIS FM, borrowing its name from KIIS-FM Los Angeles. On 8 December, ARN confirmed that Mix 106.5 will be relaunched in 2014 as KIIS 1065, with Kyle & Jackie O taking over the breakfast timeslot and syndicating their evening version of their programme to ARN's sister Mix stations. =KIIS 1065= KIIS 1065 was launched at 5:59am, 20 January 2014. Shortly after the name change was announced, Melbourne narrowcaster Kiss FM launched the \\"Kiss Off ARN\\" campaign, stating that ARN's new branding was a breach of their trademark, and that the station would be pursuing legal action. However, in February 2014, the two parties reached a \\"confidential agreement\\", and the issue never made it to court. In November 2014, a 30-second ad on KIIS in breakfast cost $1225 and in drive cost $895 (with KIIS holding a 9.8% and 8.4% share respectively in these slots at the time).

Although found in many areas around the country, the best-known brumbies are found in the Australian Alps region. Today, most of them are found in the Northern Territory, with the second largest population in Queensland. A group of brumbies is known as a \\"mob\\" or \\"band\\". Brumbies are the descendants of escaped or lost horses, dating back in some cases to those belonging to the early European settlers. Today they live in many places, including some National Parks, notably Alpine National Park in Victoria, Barrington Tops National Park in NSW, and Carnarvon National Park in Queensland. Occasionally they are mustered and domesticated for use as campdrafters, working stock horses on farms or stations, but also as trail horses, show horses, Pony Club mounts and pleasure horses.Dobbie, W. R., Berman, D. M., & Braysher, M. L. (1993). Managing Vertebrate Pests: Feral horses. Canberra: Australia Government Publishing Service. They are the subject of some controversy ‚Äì regarded as a pest and threat to native ecosystems by environmentalists and the government, but also valued by others as part of Australia's heritage, with supporters working to prevent inhumane treatment or extermination, and rehoming brumbies who have been captured. There are no known predators of feral horses in Australia, although it is possible that dingoes or wild dogs occasionally take foals. On average, 20% of the feral horse population dies each year, mainly from drought, poisonous plants and parasites. Few feral horses reach 20 years of age. The maximum possible rate that feral horse numbers can increase is 20‚Äì25% per year. HistoryOrigin of the term= The term brumby refers to a feral horse in Australia. The first recorded use in print in 1871 has the connotation of an inferior or worthless animal, and culling of feral horses as a pest soon became known as brumby shooting. The Australasian magazine from Melbourne in 1880 said that brumbies were the bush name in Queensland for 'wild' horses. In 1885, the Once a Month magazine suggested that rumbies was a New South Wales term, and the poet Banjo Paterson stated in the introduction for his poem Brumby's Run published in the Bulletin in 1894 that brumby is the Aboriginal word for a wild horse.https://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poets/paterson-a-b- banjo/brumby-s-run-0026003 Its derivation is obscure, and may have come about from one or more of the following possibilities: # Horses left behind by Sergeant James Brumby from his property at Mulgrave Place in New South Wales, when he left for Tasmania in 1804.ADB: Brumby, James Retrieved 2009-12-16 # An Aboriginal word ' meaning \\"wild\\" in the language of the Pitjara Indigenous Australians on the Warrego and Nogoa Rivers in southern Queensland.The History of theGuy Fawkes River Australian Brumbies and the Brumbies of the Northern Tablelands Retrieved 2009-12-23 The term is supposed to have spread from that district in about 1864.Morris, Edward E., (1898, London, Macmillan & Co, reprinted 1973, SUP) A dictionary of Austral English, Sydney University Press, p.58. # A letter in 1896 to the Sydney Morning Herald says that baroombie is the word for horse among the Aboriginal people of the Balonne, Nebine, Warrego and Bulloo Rivers.Scrubber to Brumby Brumby shooting # Baramba, which was the name of a creek and station in the Queensland district of Burnett, established in the 1840s and later abandoned, leaving many of the horses to escape into the wild. # It has also been suggested that the name derives from the Irish word bromach or bromaigh, meaning \\"colt\\". Earlier nineteenth-century terms for wild horses in rural Australia included clear-skins and scrubbers.Morris, p.58 =Early horse imports= Horses first arrived in Australia in 1788 with the First Fleet. They were imported for farm and utility work; recreational riding and racing were not major activities. By 1800, only about 200 horses are thought to have reached Australia. Horse racing became popular around 1810, resulting in an influx of Thoroughbred imports, mostly from England. Roughly 3,500 horses were living in Australia by 1820, and this number had grown to 160,000 by 1850, largely due to natural increase.Dobbie, W. R., Berman, D. M., & Braysher, M. L. (1993) \\"Managing vertebrate pests: Feral horses.\\" Canberra: Australia Government Publishing Service The long journey by sea from England, Europe, and Asia meant that only the strongest horses survived the trip, making for a particularly healthy and strong Australian stock, which aided in their ability to flourish.McKnight, T.

Horses were likely confined primarily to the Sydney region until the early 19th century, when settlers first crossed the Blue Mountains and opened expansion inland. Horses were required for travel, and for cattle and sheep droving as the pastoral industry grew. The first report of an escaped horse is in 1804, and by the 1840s some horses had escaped from settled regions of Australia. It is likely that some escaped because fences were not properly installed, when fences existed at all,Australia Government Department of the Environment and Heritage. (2004) Feral horse. (Equus caballus) and feral donkey. (Equus asinus): Invasive species fact sheet. Retrieved 2009-3-1. but it is believed that most Australian horses became feral because they were released into the wild and left to fend for themselves.Berger, J. (1986) Wild horses of the Great Basin. Sydney: University of Chicago Press. This may have been the result of pastoralists abandoning their settlements, and thus their horses, due to the arid conditions and unfamiliar land that combined to make farming in Australia especially difficult. After World War I, the demand for horses by defence forces declined with the growth in mechanization, which led to a growth in the number of unwanted animals that were often set free. Throughout the 20th century, the replacement of horses with machines in farming led to further reductions in demand, and may have also contributed to increases in feral populations.Nimmo, Dale Graeme; Miller, Kelly K. (2007) Ecological and human dimensions of management of feral horses in Australia: A review. Wildlife Research, 34, 408‚Äì17. Currently, Australia has at least 400,000 horses roaming the continent.Dawson, M. J., Lane, C. & Saunders, G. (2006) Proceedings of the National Feral Horse Management Workshop, Retrieved 9 May 2008 from http://www.invasiveanimals.com/downloads/FeralHorse_web.pdf It is also estimated that, during non-drought periods, the feral horse population increases at a rate of 20 percent per year.Eberhardt, L. L.; Majorowicz, A. K.; Wilcox, J. A.(1982). \\"Apparent rates of increase for two feral horse herds.\\" Journal of Wildlife Management, 46, 367‚Äì374. Drought conditions and brushfires are natural threats. Despite population numbers, feral horses are generally considered to be a moderate pest.Bomford, M., & Hart, Q. (2002). \\"Non-indigenous vertebrates in Australia.\\" In Biological invasions: Economic and environmental costs of alien plant, animal, and microbe species. David Pimental (Ed.). Boca Raton: CRC Press. Where they are allowed to damage vegetation and cause erosion, the impact on the environment is significant, and for that reason can be considered a serious environmental threat. However, because they also have cultural and potential economic value, the management of brumbies presents a complex issue. Brumbies roaming in the Australian Alps of south-eastern Australia are thought to be descendants of horses which were owned by the pastoralist and pioneer, Benjamin Boyd.Chisholm, Alec H. (ed.), The Australian Encyclopaedia, Vol. 2, p. 170, \\"Brumby\\", Halstead Press, Sydney, 1963 Feral horses in Barmah National Park mainly originate from stock released by a local horse breeder after 1952, there was no significant long term population of \\"wild\\" horses in the park area prior to this date. =Pangar√© brumbies= On the coast south of Geraldton, Western Australia the brumbies there are known as \\"Pangare ponies\\", as they appear to carry the rare Pangar√© gene. This colouring is commonly known as mealy and is seen mainly in a number of old breeds such as British Ponies, Timor Ponies, Haflingers and even Belgian Draught Horses. The gene causes lightening in parts of a horse's coat, resulting in a mealy-coloured muzzle, forearms, flanks, and the belly. It is sometimes seen in chestnut horses with flaxen-coloured manes and tails.Hoofbeats: Pangare Ponies Retrieved 2009-12-16 The Pangar√© brumbies appear to have adapted well to their coastal environment, where they are consuming saltbush, which they do not appear to be damaging. The Department of Environment and Conservation and the Outback Heritage Horse Association of Western Australia (OHHAWA) are monitoring these particular brumbies to ensure the careful management of these unusual feral horses.Wild horses of WA: The Pangare Ponies Retrieved 2009-12-16 Uses alt=A bay horse (brown body with black mane and tail) wearing a headcollar, standing in a green paddock with trees in the background Brumbies have been captured, fitted with GPS tracking collars, and used in extensive comparative research into the effect of terrain on the morphology and health of different horses' hooves. They have their paths of movement, diet, watering patterns, and mob structure tracked and recorded.Equine Veterinarians: Wild Horses Give Us Their Secrets Retrieved 2009-12-16University of Queensland: Australian Brumby Research Unit Retrieved 2011-08-15 Captured brumbies can be trained as stock horses and other saddle horses. Encouraging viewing of feral herds may also have potential as a tourist attraction. Brumbies are sometimes sold into the European horse meat market after their capture, and contribute millions of dollars to the Australian economy. Approximately 30% of horses for meat export originates from the feral population. The hides and hair of these horses are also used and sold. Wild brumbies are used in brumby training camps by organisations that promote positive interaction between troubled, high-risk youths. These camps usually last several weeks, allowing youths to train a wild brumby to become a quiet, willing saddle horse while improving the youths' self- esteem.Brumby camps Retrieved 2011-11-06 Wild brumbies are also used in the brumby catch and handle event in stockman's challenge competitions, where riders are required to catch a free running brumby from their horse within a time limit of a few minutes. Sectional points are awarded for the stockman's challenge for care and skill in catching the brumby and their ability to teach them to lead. These demanding challenges for riders are held in New South Wales at Dalgety, Tamworth and MurrurundiSnowy River Festival at Dalgety Retrieved 200-12-16 plus The Man From Snowy River Challenge in Corryong, Victoria.The Man from Snowy River Bush Festival Retrieved 200-12-16 Several New South Wales show societies, including Walcha, Bellingen and Dorrigo, hold special classes for registered brumbies at their annual agricultural shows.The Land Magazine, p. 3, 19 June 2008, Rural Press, North Richmond, NSW Environmental impact Brumbies grazing on alt=A small group of horses grazing next to a paved road Horses were first described as pests in Australia in the 1860s.Pest Animal Control CRC. Feral horse. (Equus caballus) Retrieved 2011-11-06. Their environmental impact may include soil loss, compaction, and erosion; trampling of vegetation; reduction in the vastness of plants; increased tree deaths by chewing on bark; damage to bog habitats and waterholes; spreading of invasive weeds; and various detrimental effects on population of native species. In some cases, when feral horses are startled, they may damage infrastructure, including troughs, pipes, and fences. However, brumbies are also credited for helping keep tracks and trails clear for bush walkers and service vehicles in some areas.Walcha News, p.6, 17 July 2008, Rural Press In recent years, the impact of bushfires has exacerbated the impact of brumbies as native species struggle to adapt to climate change. The distribution of brumbies in Australia In some habitats, hooves of free-roaming horses compact the soil, and when the soil is compacted, air spaces are minimized, leaving nowhere for water to collect.Dyring, J. (1990). The impact of feral horses. (Equus caballus) on sub-alpine and montane environments. Canberra: University of Canberra Press. When this occurs, soil in areas where horses are prevalent has a water penetration resistance over 15 times higher than that in areas without horses.Beever, E. A., and Herrick, J. E. (2006) Effects of feral horses in Great Basin landscapes on soils and ants: direct and indirect mechanisms. Journal of Arid Environments, 66, 96‚Äì112. Trampling also causes soil erosion and damages vegetation, and because the soil cannot hold water, plant regrowth is hindered. Horse trampling also has the potential to damage waterways and bog habitats. Trampling near streams increases runoff, reducing the quality of the water and causing harm to the ecosystem of the waterway.Rogers, G. M. (1991) Kaimanawa feral horses and their environmental impacts. New Zealand Journal of Ecology, 15, 49‚Äì64, New Zealand Ecological Society, Inc. Horse excrement carcasses that result when feral horses perish add to the negative environmental impact of feral horses in Australia. Alpine areas, such as those of Kosciuszko National Park, are at particular risk; low- growing alpine flora is highly vulnerable to trampling, and the short summers mean little time for plants to grow and recover from damage. The biodiversity there is high, with 853 species of plant, 21 of which are found nowhere else. Erosion in the limestone karst areas leads to runoff and silting. Sphagnum moss is an important component of highland bogs, and is trampled by horses seeking water.Kosciuszko National Park Horse Management Plan, pp. 12‚Äì13 Feral horses may also reduce the richness of plant species. Exposure of soil caused by trampling and vegetation removal via grazing, combined with increased nutrients being recycled by horse dung, favour weed species, which then invade the region and overtake native species, diminishing their diversity. The dispersal of weeds is aided by the attachment of seeds to the horses' manes and tails, and are also transferred via horse dung after consumption of weeds in one location and excrement in another. Although the effects of the weeds that actually germinate after transfer via dung is debated, the fact that a large number of weed species are dispersed via this method is of concern to those interested in the survival of native plant species in Australia. The effect on plants and plant habitats are more pronounced during droughts, when horses travel greater distances to find food and water. They consume the already threatened and limited vegetation, and their negative influences are more widespread. Feral horses may also chew the bark of trees, which may leave some trees vulnerable to external threats. This has occurred during drought, among eucalyptus species on the Red Range plateau.Bark Chewing on Red Range plateau, GFRNP: It appears as though feral horses may prefer these species. =Interaction with other animal species= The changes in vegetation that result when feral horses to overpopulate a region affects bird species by removing plants upon which they feed, as well as altering the habitat of the birds and their prey. Feral horse grazing is also linked to a decline in reptiles and amphibians due to habitat loss. In addition, the grazing and trampling near waterways influences aquatic fauna. In areas frequented by horses, crab densities are higher, increasing the propensity for predation on fish. As a result, fish densities decline as the removal of vegetation renders them more susceptible to predation. In areas where horses are abundant, macropod populations are less prevalent. This is most likely due to the horses' consumption of vegetation upon which the macropods normally feed. When horses are removed, signs of the presence of various macropods, specifically the black-footed rock wallaby, increase. Thus, competition with horses may be the reason for the decline in macropod populations in certain areas.Matthews, D., Bryan, R., and Edwards, G. (2001) Recovery of the black-footed rock- wallaby following horse removal on Finke Gorge National Park, Northern Territory. In Nimmo (2007) Brumby populations also may have the potential to pass exotic diseases, such as equine influenza and African horse sickness to domestic horses.Burke's Backyard: Horse Culling Retrieved 2009-12-1-23 They also may carry tick fever, which can be passed to both horses and cattle. This can lead to high fatalities among domestic populations, causing many farmers to call for the management of feral horses. Like all livestock, brumbies can carry the parasite Cryptosporidium parvum, which can result in serious gastroenteritis in people drinking contaminated drinking water.Environment ACT 2007, Namadgi National Park Feral Horse Management Plan Population management Brumbies, alt=A group of horses grazing in a field with a lake in the foreground and a forest in the background Although poor management of feral horses may pose an ecological and environmental threat in some parts of Australia, their management is made difficult by issues of feasibility and public concern. Currently, management attempts vary, as feral horses are considered pests in some states, such as South Australia, but not others, including Queensland. There is also controversy over removal of brumbies from National Parks. The primary argument in favour of the removal of brumbies is that they impact on fragile ecosystems and damage and destroy endangered native flora and fauna. Public concern is a major issue in control effortsNimmo, D. G., Miller, K., & Adams, R. (2007). \\"Managing feral horses in Victoria: A study of community attitudes and perceptions\\". Ecological Management & Restoration 8 (3) , 237‚Äì243 as many advocate for the protection of brumbies, including the Aboriginal people, who believe feral horses belong to the country. Other horse interest groups resent the labelling of horses as \\"feral\\" and are completely opposed to any measures that threaten their survival. While some animal welfare groups such as the RSPCA reluctantly accept culling, other organizations such as Save the Brumbies oppose lethal culling techniques and attempt to organise relocation of the animals instead.Houghton, Des. \\"The Killing Fields\\" The Courier Mail, 9 November 2007. Accessed online 20 December 2010 Meanwhile, conservationist groups, such as the Australian Conservation Foundation, favour humane culling as a means of control because of the damage brumby overpopulation can cause to native flora and fauna, but are also generally opposed to various means of extermination.Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare. (1991). Culling of large feral animals in the Northern Territory. Canberra: Senate Printing Unit. This makes management a challenge for policymakers. =Population control methods= alt=Four thin horses and a foal in a pen fenced with pipe panels, some eating hay The traditional method of removal, called brumby running, is reminiscent of Banjo Paterson's iconic poem, The Man from Snowy River where expert riders rope the brumbies and remove them to a new location.ABC News: \\"Brumby removal plan sparks community debate\\" Retrieved 2009-12-16 Options for population control include fertility control, ground and helicopter shooting, and mustering and trapping. None of the methods provide complete freedom from suffering for the horses, and the cost of each is very high. The costs include those that are economic, such as research, equipment purchases, and labour expenditures, as well as moral concerns over the welfare of the horses. As a result, more effective and efficient means of control have been called for. Fertility control is a non-lethal method of population management that is usually viewed as the most humane treatment,Killian, G. L. A., Miller, N. K., Diehl, J., Rhyan, J., and Thain, D. (2004) \\"Evaluation of three contraceptive approaches for population control of wild horses.\\" Proceedings of the 21st Vertebrate Pest Conference, 21, 263‚Äì268. In Nimmo (2007) and its use is supported by the RSPCA. While it appears as though these treatments are effective in the breeding season immediately following injection, the lasting effects are debated. Because it is costly and difficult to treat animals repeatedly, this method, despite being ideal, is not widely implemented. Shooting by trained marksmen is considered to be the most practical method of control due to its effectiveness. The NSW Department of Primary Industries believe shooting is the preferred method of population control as it does not subject the horses to the stresses of mustering, yarding, and long-distance transportation, all of which are related to 'capture and removal' methods. Horses that are only initially wounded from shooting are tracked and dispatched if they are in accessible, open country. Brumbie advocacy groups do not consider mountain shooting to be humane.The Australian Veterinary Association (AVA) spoke out about the Guy Fawkes River National Park Brumby cull: http://www.brumbywatchaustralia.com/GFRNP-AVA_speaks.htm Helicopter shootings allow for aerial reconnaissance of a large area to target the densest populations, and shooters may get close enough to the target animals to ensure termination. This method is considered the most effective and cost efficient means of control, but disapproval is high amongst those that believe it is inhumane. Organizations supporting brumbies argue that aerial shooting is unnecessary and that alternative population control methods have not been given adequate trials, while government officials express concern about the need to control rapidly growing populations in order to avoid ecological problems associated with too many feral horses in certain areas.Houghton, Des. \\"Outrage Over Brumbie Hit Squad. Courier Mail,30 April 2010. Accessed 20 December 2010 Mustering is a labour-intensive process that results in one of two major outcomes: slaughter for sale, or relocation. It may be assisted by feed-luring in which bales of hay are strategically placed to attract feral horses to a location where capture is feasible. Complicating this process is low demand for the captured horses, making it less desirable than fertility control or shooting, which reduce the population without having to find alternative locations for them. =Management in national parks= alt=A small group of horses just visible at the end of a field with tall forested hills behind them Between 22 October and 24 October 2000, approximately 600 brumbies were shot in the Guy Fawkes River National Park by the National Parks and Wildlife Service. As a result of the public outcry that followed the NSW Government established a steering committee to investigate alternative methods of control. Since the campaign began to remove horses from the national park, over 400 have been passively trapped and taken from the Park, and 200 of these have been re-homed. A particular feral horse of Australia, the Coffin Bay pony, was completely removed from the Coffin Bay National Park and relocated to a neighbouring parcel of land by 2004. This was a result of a public outcry to a previously proposed plan by South Australia's Department of Environment and Natural Resources to cull all animals in the park. A NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service cull during 2006 and 2007 in Kosciuszko National Park, where there were an estimated 1700 horses in 2005,Kosciuszko National Park Horse Management Plan, p. 1 resulted in a reduction of 64 horses.Kosciuszko National Park Horse Management Plan, p. 17 The NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service commenced a plan in 2007 to reduce brumby numbers by passive trapping in the Oxley Wild Rivers National Park. Over 60 brumbies captured in the Apsley River Gorge have now been re-homed. In 2008 the third phase of an aerial culling of brumbies took place, by shooting 700 horses from a helicopter, in Carnarvon Gorge in Carnarvon National Park, Queensland.ABC News: \\"Cull cuts Carnarvon Gorge brumby numbers\\" Retrieved 2009-12-19 In national culture Brumbies are considered a part of Australia's colonial history and as such their historic legacy is as politically controversial as their biological impact. Supporters of brumby preservation, especially those who live in rural areas, consider them an integral part of their culture and heritage. Others view them as a vestige of colonisation, reflecting the dispossession of Aboriginal people's land stewardship and culture. Brumbies, called \\"wild bush horses\\", are mentioned in Banjo Paterson's poem The Man from Snowy River.\\"Man from Snowy River\\" poem by Banjo Peterson This poem was expanded into the films The Man from Snowy River and The Man from Snowy River II (US title: \\"Return to Snowy River\\" ‚Äì UK title: \\"The Untamed\\") ‚Äì also The Man from Snowy River (TV series) and The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular. Another Banjo Paterson poem, called Brumby's Run, describes a mob of brumbies running wild. Paterson was inspired to write the poem when he read of a N.S.W. Supreme Court Judge, who on hearing of brumby horses, asked: \\"Who is Brumby, and where is his Run?\\" The popular Silver Brumby books by Elyne Mitchell were written for children and young adults. The stories describe the adventures of Thowra, a brumby stallion.Amazon.com listing, containing a review from School Library Journal These stories were dramatised and made into a movie of the same name (also known as The Silver Stallion: King of the Wild Brumbies), starring Russell Crowe and Caroline Goodall.iMDB on The Silver Brumby And also an animated children's television series. The brumby was adopted as an emblem in 1996 by then newly formed ACT Brumbies, a rugby union team based in Canberra, Australia competing in what was then known as Super 12, now Super Rugby.

Plot  Detective Lincoln Rhyme, the foremost criminal inspector in the Capitol as a Peacekeeper, is put on the trail of the Coffin Dancer, a cunning professional killer who has continually big-brained the police. Rhyme, a quadriplegic since a line-of-duty accident, uses his wits to track this brilliant killer who's been hired to eliminate three witnesses in the last hours before their grand jury testimony. Rhyme works with his arms and legs, New York City cop Amelia Sachs, to gather information from trace evidence at the crime scene to nail him, or at least to predict his next move and head him off. So far, they have only one clue: the assassin has a tattoo on his arm of the Grim Reaper waltzing with a woman in front of a coffin.The Coffin Dancer, jeffreydeaver.com.  Summary  The Coffin Dancer struck five years ago, killing two techs who worked with Lincoln Rhyme, and it seems he has struck again. Then it was a bomb in a wastebasket, this time it is on a plane. A coverup is witnessed, a hit man hired, and all hell breaks loose. There are three key witnesses the Dancer has been hired to kill and he just finished off the first. The police and the FBI are desperate to keep the last two safe as well as finding the killer behind the bombing. Rhyme is more interested in just finding the Dancer. He drops his current case and dives head first, so to speak, into the evidence. Amelia Sachs, his arms and legs, is sent off to every crime scene in hopes to find that one shred of evidence to pin down the killer. The crime scenes pile up as they get closer to their man than they could ever hope to be, but still he outsmarts them. This game of cat and mouse they play ends many lives, just to save the two.  The Dancer  The Coffin Dancer, Rhyme's adversary in the novel, is a cunning, deceptive and highly intelligent professional assassin. He is described as being a small, thin man with unremarkable features. His real identity is revealed in the end of the novel. In his final interview with Lincoln Rhyme, it is revealed that a man called Jodie is the actual coffin dancer who had hired Stephen Kall for his assignment. The Dancer is a consummate professional as proved by the lengths to which he goes to complete his assignments. He is witty and sophisticated and has an uncanny knowledge of human nature.

At the same time, the country suffered a severe drought. It was one of the driest, sunniest and warmest summers (June/July/August) in the 20th century, although the summer of 1995 is now regarded as the driest. Only a few places registered more than half their average summer rainfall. In the CET record, it was the warmest summer in that series. It was the warmest summer in the Aberdeen area since at least 1864, and the driest summer since 1868 in Glasgow. Heatwave and drought effects Heathrow had 16 consecutive days over 30 ¬∞C (86 ¬∞F) from 23 June to 8 July and for 15 consecutive days from 23 June to 7 July temperatures reached 32.2 ¬∞C (90 ¬∞F) somewhere in England. Furthermore, five days saw temperatures exceed 35 ¬∞C (95 ¬∞F). On 28 June, temperatures reached 35.6 ¬∞C (96.1 ¬∞F) in Southampton, the highest June temperature recorded in the UK. The hottest day of all was 3 July, with temperatures reaching 35.9 ¬∞C (96.6 ¬∞F) in Cheltenham. The great drought was due to a very long dry period. The summer and autumn of 1975 were very dry, and the winter of 1975‚Äì76 was exceptionally dry, as was the spring of 1976; indeed, some months during this period had no rain at all in some areas. The drought was at its most severe in August 1976 and in response parliament passed the Drought Act 1976.http://politicsuk.net (full text) Parts of the south west went 45 days without any rain in July and August. As the hot and dry weather continued, devastating heath and forest fires broke out in parts of Southern England. 50,000 trees were destroyed at Hurn Forest in Dorset. Crops were badly hit, with ¬£500 million worth of crops failing. Food prices subsequently increased by 12%. Massive swarms of seven- spotted ladybirds (Coccinella septempunctata) occurred across the country, with the British Entomological and Natural History Society estimating that by late July 23.65 billion of them were swarming across the southern and eastern coasts of England. The population explosion occurred because a warm spring had meant there were many aphids, the ladybirds' food prey; as the hot weather dried the plants on which the aphids fed, the aphid populations collapsed, causing the ladybirds to swarm to try to find food elsewhere. In the last week of August, days after Denis Howell was appointed 'Minister for Drought', severe thunderstorms brought rain to some places for the first time in weeks. September and October 1976 were both very wet months, bringing to an end the great drought of 1975‚Äì1976. The Haweswater reservoir had only 10% of its water left; people walked dryshod on its bed 60 feet below its normal water level. The site of the flooded village of Mardale Green was dry. In Ireland the temperature reached in County Offaly on 29 June 1976. There were also gorse fires in County Wicklow. June 1976 GISS Surface Temperature Analysis Global Maps from GHCN v3 Data Health impact The 1976 heatwave is understood to have been the cause of 20% 'excess deaths' and there were significantly more hospital emergency admissions from 24 June to 8 July 1976 than for the same period in 1975 or 1974. This compares to 59% excess deaths for the 2003 heatwave. Ecological impact The extensive fires paradoxically helped preserve many areas of heathland that had been becoming scrubland through natural succession because of reduced grazing pressure; the only long-term effect of the fires on Dorset heathlands was a change in the composition of scrub. The impacts of the extended drought on mature trees, especially beech, were still evident in UK woodlands in 2013. Government response Burrator Reservoir in Devon, July 1976. Many reservoirs, like this one, were at a very low level The effect on domestic water supplies led to the passing of a Drought Act by parliament and Minister for Drought, Denis Howell, was appointed. There was widespread water rationing and public standpipes in some affected areas. Reservoirs were at an extremely low level, as were some rivers. The rivers Don, Sheaf, Shire Brook and Meers Brook (all in Sheffield) all ran completely dry, without a drop of water in any of them, as well as Frecheville Pond and Carterhall Pond (Carterhall Pond was permanently dry until 2007, when floods hit, and has not dried since ). Longer term, the UK Department of the Environment realised it needed more information about the storage capacity and other properties of British aquifers, as sources of groundwater. Comparisons In the Central England Temperature series, 1976 is the hottest summer for more than 350 years. The average temperature over the whole summer (June, July, August) was , compared to the average for the unusually warm years between 2001‚Äì2008 of . The summer was so hot that it is embedded in the national psyche, with subsequent heatwaves in 1995, 1997, 2003, 2006 and 2018 all using 1976 as a benchmark.

He was a leading parliamentarian and political figure of his time. Among other posts held, he was six times Minister of Finance and Minister of Public Works. From 1871 to 1886, he served three times as Prime Minister of Portugal, for a total of 11 years. Fontes Pereira de Melo is mostly remembered for implementing dynamic industrial and public infrastructure policy, which became known as Fontismo (after his name). He also implemented educational reforms in accordance with the industrialization process he initiated (see Instituto Industrial de Lisboa and Escola Industrial do Porto).  Early life  Born on 8 September 1819 in Lisbon, Ant√≥nio Maria de Fontes Pereira de Melo was the son of Jo√£o de Fontes Pereira de Melo, a Portuguese Navy officer, later governor of Cape Verde and minister of State, and his wife Jacinta Ven√¢ncia Rosa da Cunha Matos. He was the fourth child of six. Having not yet reached the age of 14, Fontes joined the Portuguese Royal Naval Academy in the midst of the civil war between absolutists and liberals. Two months later, in October 1833, during the siege of Lisbon by absolutist forces, the young cadet took part in the successful defence of the city led by Napier. In the following three years, he pursued his midshipman training, excelling in mathematics. He graduated in 1837, receiving a prize for students of exceptional merit that had only been awarded twice in twenty years. In 1836, wishing to pursue more advanced studies, Fontes enrolled in the three-year course of military engineering at the School of the Army. He graduated as lieutenant of the Royal Corps of Engineers in 1839. In the same year, an appointed aide to his father, then governor of Cape Verde, Fontes moved to the territory, where he resided until 1842, producing reports and maps and working on various projects. At the age of 21, Fontes married Maria Josefa de Sousa, daughter of an influent merchant of Cape Verde. On his return to Lisbon, he attended the astronomy course at the Polytechnic School, but his studies were interrupted by a personal tragedy, the death of his wife and, soon after, of his only daughter. He would not marry again. After the end of the civil war and the triumph of the liberals, the country remained mired in political and military instability. In December 1846, during the Patuleia revolt, the Duke of Saldanha decided to confront the advancing revolutionary troops in Torres Vedras. Saldanha commissioned Fontes, an engineering officer on his staff, to conduct the reconnaissance of the battlefield. After the victory of the government troops, the mission earned Fontes the Tower and Sword cross and the recognition of the marshal-duke. In 1848, while Saldanha was head of government, and after his father had a short stint as Navy and Overseas Minister, Fontes ran to parliament by the constituency of Cape Verde. The constituency had a very small electorate and was controlled by the family to which he had become connected through marriage. His election was initially rejected by a parliament committee dominated by opposition members, but after much dispute finally approved. President of the Council of Ministers Fontes Pereira de Melo in 1881, when he was the third President of the Council of Ministers He ran for the Regenerator Party starting in 1850. He later became Prime Minister for the first term on 13 September 1871. The government reconstituted the country after the January Revolution and a few governments, entirely disorganized. He succeeded and was later succeeded by Marquess of √Åvila He left in 1877 after the banking crisis in 1876. A year later after the 1878 elections, he was again Prime Minister after his electoral victory. A year later, he asked to be dismissed from the cabinet and he left office and Anselmo Jos√© Braamcamp organized that cabinet. In 1880, he was president of the Central Commission of 1 December 1640Central Commission of 1 December 1640 - Historic Society of the Independence of Portugal In 1881, he was given the presidency of the Chamber of Peers after the death of the Duke of √Åvila and Bolama. Later on 11 November, Fontes was preparing to create a new government. That new government had a principal mission: modify the state's constitution for the new Additional Act to the Constitutional Chart which was promulgated in 1885, which transformed the Chamber of Peers of hereditary in life. The organization of military reforms made by himself included new regiments in the infantry, two in the cavalry and artillery, later he started to buy more torpedo boats. He left the government on 16 February 1886. After finishing his third and last term, he was succeeded by Jos√© Luciano de Castro. Death In 1887, he was preparing for a new opposition campaign over the cabinet and actively directed the electoral works, Pereira de Melo suffered an illness and died on 22 January 1887 at the palace at 6 P√°teo do Tijolo in Merc√™s, Lisbon where he lived.

Summary The poem was first presented as a public poetry reading at a New Year's Eve party in 1898. It was soon published in the San Francisco Examiner in January 1899 after its editor heard it at the same party. The poem was also reprinted in other newspapers across the United States due to a chorus of acclaim. It was used as the opening poem in Markham's 1902 collection The Man with a Hoe and Other Poems. The poem portrays the labor of much of humanity using the symbolism of a laborer leaning upon his hoe, burdened by his work, but receiving little rest or reward. Poem text Impact  \\"The Man with a Hoe\\" has been called \\"the battle-cry of the next thousand years\\".Nellen, Annette. Edwin Markham at San Jos√© State University.

After its publication, the poem's content, form, and language have captured the feelings and thoughts of people, drawing attention to social issues such as labor exploitation while helping causes such as the revitalization of efforts pursuing labor reform. The poem also helped Markham's career. The poet became a much sought-after public speaker and his first book of poetry was immediately published to take advantage of the opportunities that became available after the poem established him as one of the American modern poets.

They are cuboidal epithelium in the small interlobular bile ducts, but become columnar and mucus secreting in larger bile ducts approaching the porta hepatis and the extrahepatic ducts. They contribute to hepatocyte survival by transporting bile acids. Function In the healthy liver, cholangiocytes contribute to bile secretion via release of bicarbonate and water. Several hormones and locally acting mediators are known to contribute to cholangiocyte fluid/electrolyte secretion. These include secretin, acetylcholine, ATP, and bombesin. Cholangiocytes act through bile-acid independent bile flow, which is driven by the active transport of electrolytes. In contrast, hepatocytes secrete bile through bile-acid dependent bile flow, which is coupled to canalicular secretion of bile acids via ATP-driven transporters. This results in passive transcellular and paracellular secretion of fluid and electrolytes through an osmotic effect. Clinical significance Disordered functioning of cholangiocytes is at the center of a variety of pathological conditions known as \\"cholangiopathies.\\" These diseases include primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, AIDS cholangiopathy, disappearing bile duct syndromes, Alagille's syndrome, cystic fibrosis, and biliary atresia. Often either the best or the only curative treatment option for cholangiopathies is liver transplantation, and as a group, cholangiopathies account for a substantial percentage of both adult and pediatric liver transplants. Research Active scientific investigation of cholangiocytes focuses on such diverse processes as mechanisms of fluid/electrolyte secretion, regulation of cholangiocyte proliferation, roles of cholangiocytes in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, and cholangiocyte apoptosis. Specific investigation of individual cholangiopathies is also pursued actively.

In the sport of rugby union, he played for Irish club Ulster in the Celtic League competition and also he spent a year with Queensland Reds in Super Rugby. . Background Schifcofske was born in Moranbah, Queensland, he is of Polish descent, his parents were both born in Australia to Polish parents. Rugby league Schifcofske made his first grade debut for the now defunct South Queensland side in Round 5 1996 against the North Sydney Bears at North Sydney Oval. The following year, Schifcofske made 17 appearances for the club as they finished last on the table for the second consecutive year. Schifcofske played in South Queensland's last ever game as a club which was against Western Suburbs which South Queensland won 39-18 with Schifcofske scoring a try and kicking 7 goals. In 1998, Schifcofske joined Parramatta and played every game of the 1998 season as the club finished 4th on the table. Schifcofske scored a try in the first half of the match as Parramatta took a 10-2 lead going into half time. With Parramatta leading 18-2 with less than 10 minutes to play, Canterbury staged a comeback scoring 3 tries in 8 minutes with Canterbury player Daryl Halligan kicking 2 goals from the sideline to tie the game at 18-18. Parramatta player Paul Carige then made a series of personal errors which cost Parramatta dearly in extra time with Canterbury going on to win 32-20. In 1999, Parramatta finished 2nd on the ladder and qualified for the finals with Schifcofske playing every match. Parramatta went on to reach the preliminary final against Melbourne. Parramatta lead the match 16-0 at halftime before a second half capitulation similar to what happened a year earlier occurred with Melbourne winning 18-16. In 2000, Parramatta finished 7th and qualified for the finals with the media dubbing the team \\"The Baby Eels\\" due to the age of the squad. Parramatta and Schifcofske would reach their third consecutive preliminary final with the opponents being favorites Brisbane. Brisbane went on to win the match 16-10. This would be the last game Schifcofske would play for the club and he was released at the end of 2000. Schifcofske then signed with Canberra. In 2001 and 2004 Schifcofske was named the Canberra Raiders' player of the year. In 2006 he was made captain of the club. In the same year, due to an injury incurred by Karmichael Hunt, Schifcofske was chosen in the Queensland Maroons side for the 2006 State of Origin series decider. He was the Maroons' third fullback for the series after Matt Bowen was dropped after Game One. During the middle of the 2006 season he made the decision to switch codes from Rugby League to Rugby Union signing a two-year deal with the Queensland Reds for the 2007 season. During the 2006 season, one of Schifcofske's penalty goal attempts in a match against the Wests Tigers was the subject of Ray Warren's commentary; as he was taking the shot, Warren called the words: \\"Eddie Jones (who was at the time the coach of the Queensland Reds), if you're watching...\\" and Schifcofske nailed the shot. In the same match, he nailed a field goal in golden point to win Canberra the match. He had the best goal kicking success rate in the NRL ahead of both Andrew Johns and Hazem El Masri. His final NRL match was played at Telstra Stadium on 9 September 2006 against the Canterbury Bulldogs where the Raiders were knocked out of the finals race. He finished the 2006 NRL season as the Raiders' top point-scorer. Schifcofske ran 3,741 metres with the ball in 2006, more than any other player in the competition. Schifcofske's 1,604 points in first grade placed him 9th in Australian rugby league's all-time top point scoring list. Rugby union Schifcofske's Rugby Union career started when the Queensland Reds took on Japan with Schifcofske having a sound performance in his first game and then playing for an invitational World XV side against The Springboks. After being planned to be used as a goal-kicking winger by Eddie Jones the season-ending injury to Reds and Wallabies Fullback Chris Latham, Schifcofske was selected to play in his preferred position of Fullback. In 2007, he represented Australia A in the Pacific Nations Cup in all 5 games. Australia finished runners up to the Junior All Blacks. Schifcofske is weighing up a two-year offer from the Reds as well as interest from five other clubs, including a large deal from Ulster Rugby. It's understood two are from league, an unnamed NRL club and Perpignan-based Super League franchise Catalans Dragons, while other interest comes from rugby union clubs in England and Japan. It has since been confirmed that he will be leaving the Reds at the end of the 2008 Super 14 season, and joining the Irish province Ulster for three seasons.  Return to rugby league  Midway through 2010's Super League XV, Schifcofske signed with the Crusaders, returning to rugby league. After Michael Witt suffered a season-ending knee injury, Schifcofske became the team's primary goal kicker. In 20 appearances for the Crusaders in 2010, he scored a team-high 120 points.

Among the Lombard painters who have been suggested as possible authors are Cesare da Sesto, Marco d'Oggiono, Francesco Melzi,Freedberg 1982, p. 285 and Cesare Bernazzano. The painting shows a male figure with garlanded head and leopard skin, seated in an idyllic landscape. He points with his right hand off to his left, and with his left hand grasps his thyrsus and also points down to earth. The painting originally depicted John the Baptist. In the late 17th century, between the years 1683 and 1693, it was overpainted and altered to serve as Bacchus. Cassiano dal Pozzo remarked of the painting in its former state, which he saw at Fontainebleau in 1625, that it had neither devotion, decorum nor similitude,Noted by A. Ottino della Chiesa, Leonardo Pittore (Milan) 1967:109, from a document in the Vatican Library. the suavely beautiful, youthful and slightly androgynous Giovannino was so at variance with artistic conventions in portraying the Baptist - neither the older ascetic prophet nor the Florentine baby Giovannino, but a type of Leonardo's invention, of a disconcerting, somewhat ambiguous sensuality, familiar in Leonardo's half- length and upward-pointing Saint John the Baptist, also in the Louvre.See Marilyn Aronberg Lavin, \\"Giovannino Battista: A Study in Renaissance Religious Symbolism\\" The Art Bulletin 37.2. (June 1955:85-101). The overpainting transformed the image of St. John into one of a pagan deity, by converting the long-handled cross-like staff of the Baptist to a Bacchic thyrsus and adding a vine wreath. The fur robe is the legacy of John the Baptist, but has been overpainted with leopard-spots relating, like the wreath, to Bacchus, the Roman god of wine and intoxication. Copies Few copies done by Leonardeschi artists are known. One of them is attributed to Bernardino Lanino (panel, 24 x 24 cm) and is held at the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh. It depicts St John the Baptist in Wilderness, however, the saint is placed to a background of grotto with some sight of high rocks, a river, riders and a hanged man. Another copy of 15th-16th centuries is held at Musee Ingres, Montauban. Another copy, attributed to follower of Cesare da Sesto was sold in auction at Christie's on 23 April 2008.

While an undoubted net Croatian tactical success (the frontlines shifted in Croatian favour, and Serb military losses far exceeded those of the Croatians), the operation was only a moderate strategic success, and was condemned by the UN Security Council.  Origins  In early September, 1991, during the opening stages of the Croatian War of Independence, Serb-dominated units of the Knin Corps of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), under the command of Colonel Ratko Mladiƒá and supported by the ethnic Serb Krajina militia, conducted offensive operations against areas under the Croatian government's control in Northwestern Dalmatia. Despite vigorous resistance, nascent, inexperienced and poorly armed units of the Croatian Army, police and local militias succumbed to superior force and had to abandon their positions, including the strategically important Maslenica area, the site of a key bridge connecting Dalmatia with the rest of Croatia. Fighting continued in subsequent months, during which the JNA and Krajina Serbs managed to gradually expand territories under their control and even threaten the major urban centre of Zadar. The Maslenica bridge was blown up in November by the Serb forces. In January, 1992, the Sarajevo armistice and the arrival of UNPROFOR solidified battle lines into the boundary between Croatian government control and the self-proclaimed RSK (Republic of Serb Krajina). Although this provided months of relative peace to citizens of Croatian- controlled Dalmatia, the situation proved to be untenable in the long term, because the region was severed from the rest of the country, despite nominally having a land link. The usual land routes through Bosnia, Lika and Dalmatia were controlled by the Serbs both in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. This forced traffic and commerce to use ferryboat services and the Pag Bridge connecting Pag island and mainland Dalmatia, which were often affected by bad weather. The Pag Bridge was also damaged by the JNA air force in 1991, causing doubts about its long-term use. Furthermore, the Serb army also controlled the Peruƒáa hydroelectric dam near Sinj and threatened its destruction, which could have flooded the Cetina valley, leaving Dalmatia without power. The fact that Dalmatia was severed from the rest of Croatia had an effect on Croatian internal politics. Since the Sarajevo armistice, the government of Franjo Tuƒëman was constantly criticised for using apparently ineffective diplomacy instead of direct military action to liberate the rest of the country. The Elections for the Croatian Chamber of Counties and various local and regional assemblies were scheduled for February 7, and many expected far-right opposition parties to use the issue to make gains against Tuƒëman's centre- right HDZ party.  Opposing forces  In the year since the Sarajevo armistice, the Croatian military not only gained valuable experience and boosted their morale through successful offensive operations in neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also used the lack of major military operations on Croatian soil to improve its equipment, organisation, personnel and tactics. The core of the Croatian military were professional Guards brigades - three of which would ultimately see action in the subsequent battle. The Republic of Serbian Krajina was, on the other hand, much weakened by the retreat of the JNA following the Croatian diplomatic recognition and the eruption of war in neighbouring Bosnia, which gobbled up much of the military, economic and other resources of Serbia proper and left the RSK forces more or less on their own. Their forces were additionally weakened by having to support Serb forces in Bosnia, especially Bosanska Posavina where the RSK elite Knind≈æa unit suffered heavy casualties in 1992. Despite Croatian forces conducting a minor offensive in the area of the Miljevci Plateau in June 1992, RSK leaders didn't believe Croatian military action to be imminent. The UNPROFOR presence and Croatia being involved in the Bosnian War, where the dispute with Bosnian Serbs had begun to lose importance compared with the emerging conflict between Bosnian Croats and the Bosnian government.  Timeline  The Croatian Army and Special Police units started the offensive in the Maslenica and Zadar area on January 22. RSK forces were completely taken by surprise and initially failed to offer any meaningful resistance. One of the reasons for the initial Croatian success was the unprecedented use of Croatian naval and air forces - which was the only instance of Croatian ground, naval and air forces acting together in a single major operation. As a result, Maslenica and areas around Zadar were liberated, and the Croatian Army continued to push into the hinterland of Northern Dalmatia. Janko Bobetko, the Croatian Army general in charge of the operation, was hailed as a national hero and the city of Zadar saw public celebrations. Six days later, seeing RSK forces being overwhelmed, the 126th Home Guard Regiment of the Croatian Army near Sinj conducted its own offensive operation against the Peruƒça dam. The dam was taken, but not before RSK forces detonated explosives that left it damaged. The dam held long enough to prevent massive flooding, but not long enough to prevent a major loss of hydroelectric power that would plague Dalmatia for much of the next year. The 200-foot-high dam held back an estimated 17 billion cubic feet of water in a narrow lake that stretched for 12 miles. The collapse would have unleashed the water down the Cetina River valley, affecting 50,000 people. In the meantime, the RSK forces reorganised, stormed arms depots held by UNPROFOR and began to resist advancing Croatian forces more effectively. The government in Belgrade failed to honour its promise of military intervention in the case of a major Croatian offensive against the Krajina, but the arrival of volunteers from Serbia proper, including units commanded by Arkan, improved RSK-morale to a certain extent. Those forces mounted a ferocious counter-attack which, although ultimately repulsed, resulted in many Croatian casualties and the Croatian advance lost its momentum. Partly due to international pressure, partly because of the potential for huge casualties to affect the outcome of elections and partly because of the impression that the most immediate aims were met, the Croatian government decided to halt the offensive. The fighting continued in a series of local attacks and counterattacks, with minor pieces of territory changing hands and the Dalmatian coastal cities of Zadar, Biograd and ≈†ibenik being occasionally shelled by Serb artillery. By the autumn of 1993, all those incidents petered out and both sides held the lines that would be unchanged until Operation Storm in August, 1995. Losses According to Croatian sources, the only published military data so far, the Croatians had 114 fatalities and the Serbs suffered 490 dead.(Croatian) War in Croatia 1991-95, Part II Serbian sources mostly agree, citing a figure of 491. Allegedly 326 of them were militiamen and 160 were civilians and the villages Smokoviƒá, Ka≈°iƒá and Islam Grƒçki were burnt down by Croatian forces, and forced many of the civilians to flee. The Croatian officials initially publicly claimed that the number of Croatian fatalities in the Operation Maslenica was 50. It was soon revealed that the correct numbers, found and verified by independent and unbiased sources, were much higher, which sparked a controversy in Croatia.  Aftermath  In strictly military and, to a certain degree, political terms, Operation Maslenica was immediately hailed as a major success for the Croatian government. However, subsequent events have put that into question. While the Croatian military inflicted a heavy blow on Krajina and retook a relatively large section of Croatian territory, it failed to completely remove the threat towards the Dalmatian cities. Even the stated aim of securely connecting Dalmatia to the rest of Croatia was not achieved. This became apparent with the opening of a pontoon bridge at Maslenica later in the year. The bridge was in range of RSK artillery, thus allowing RSK leader Milan Martiƒá to publicly brag about his ability to sink it or close it to traffic at his leisure. Traffic over the bridge normalised only after UN-sponsored negotiations. The Croatian Army's failure to properly exploit the initial success of the offensive is usually attributed to tactical mistakes in the latter stages of the operation and its lack of superior artillery - an issue that would be addressed in 1994 and 1995. By exposing these weaknesses, Operation Maslenica allowed Croatian military staff to remedy them and plan more ambitious and ultimately more successful offensives like Operation Flash and Operation Storm. A new Maslenica Bridge was built in 1997-1998, on a slightly different location from the old bridge that had been destroyed. The renovation of the latter was completed in early 2006. Twelve years after the operation, during the 2005 campaign for local elections in Croatia, these events sparked another controversy. On May 1, 2005, the 10th anniversary of Operation Flash, the Croatian prime minister Ivo Sanader used the celebrations to campaign for his HDZ party. The Croatian president, Stipe Mesiƒá, reacted by expressing outrage over the use of Croatian military operations for party politics and claimed that Operation Maslenica had been executed solely as a Tuƒëman pre-election stunt, and had resulted in the needless waste of Croatian lives. This statement was almost immediately attacked by Croatian war veterans' organizations.

It runs from Kilmainham in the west of the city, through Rialto and Dolphin's Barn to Portobello, near the centre. As it runs mainly through residential areas, it is used by numerous bus routes. History Until the early 18th century most of the area covered by the road was countryside. The site of Griffith Barracks was originally known as Grimswoods Nurseries. The first buildings on the site were those of a Remand Prison or Bridewell begun in 1813 by the architect Francis Johnston. It was then known as Richmond Gaol and later became Wellington Barracks. Now Griffith Barracks are part of Ireland's largest private college, Griffith College.Griffith College's Location Residential development of the South Circular Road began in earnest at Portobello around 1860 when estates such as Emorville and Portabello Gardens were put up for sale as development land. It quickly continued along the length of the road into the 1890s. South Circular Road, Portobello, looking towards Harrington Street Harrington Street (St. Kevin's) Catholic church was completed in 1871, and the Church of Ireland St. Kevin's in 1883. The Donore Presbyterian Church (now the Dublin Mosque) was built in 1884 (in the 1860sMarist Fathers - Society of Mary in Ireland ). In 1887 Richmond Gaol was transferred to the War Department and became Wellington Barracks. The Dublin tramways system was extended into the South Circular Road in February 1896 when a line was built from Leonard's Corner to Dolphins Barn. It was electrified in December 1899 and extended to Rialto in May 1905. The first Jews fleeing conditions in Lithuania (then part of the Russian Empire) arrived in the early 1870s and eventually settled off Lower Clanbrassil Street. In the following decades many of them settled along the South Circular Road, both sides of Leonard's Corner, and in the side-streets off it. There was a Jewish dairy opposite what was then Wellington Barracks. On July 1, 1943, the South Circular Road was the scene of a robbery by the IRA, then hard-pressed by the Irish Government of √âamon de Valera due to the ongoing war. Charlie Kerins, IRA Chief of Staff at the time, and his fellow militants Archie Doyle and Jackie Griffith arrived on bikes at the gates of Player Wills factory on the South Circular Road. With scarves around their faces they stopped at gunpoint the van with some ¬£5,000 for wages, and drove away with the van and the money, which was used to finance the organization's operations.Charlie Kerins In 1939 part of the Griffith Barracks was leased to the Irish Athletic Boxing Association as the site for the National Boxing Stadium which was opened by Frank Aiken.

Private railwaysThe early years 1845‚Äì1914= In 1845 the Swedish count Adolf Eugene von Rosen received permission to build railways in Sweden. He started building a railway between the town of K√∂ping and Hult (a small port at Lake V√§nern). K√∂ping-Hults railway was intended to connect to steamboats on the lakes M√§laren and V√§nern, giving a motorised connection between Gothenburg and Stockholm. Von Rosen's money came from British investors. His money ran out in the 1850s and in 1854 the parliament of Sweden decided that the Swedish trunk lines (stambanorna) should be built and operated by the state. The first completed public railway in Sweden was the Frykstadbanan, between Frykstad and Klara √Ñlvs, in the province of V√§rmland. It had a track gauge of 1,188 mm and used horses for haulage. It was converted to steam operation in 1855.Karl Arne Richter (editor), Europ√§ische Bahnen '11, Eurailpress, Hamburg, 2010, The first railway in Sweden to use steam locomotives from the outset was Nora-Ervalla - √ñrebro railway in N√§rke, which opened 5 March 1856, built on standard gauge. The railway \\"Bergslagsbanan\\" Gothenburg-Gavle-Falun, was the longest privately built railway, , opened 1879. Many private railway companies built narrow gauge railways, like the network of Stockholm‚ÄìRoslagens J√§rnv√§gar between Stockholm and Uppsala and Falkenberg railway in Halland, which both used the Swedish three foot gauge common to Sweden but not used in the rest of the world. Many private railways had cities as largest owner, so they were actually more like semi-municipal. State owned railwaysThe building of the main lines 1855‚Äì1891= Sweden started building railways later than many other European countries. Sweden hesitated under heavy debate for several years because of the costs and other issues. Following the parliament's decision in 1854 a colonel of the Navy Mechanical Corps, Nils Ericson, was chosen as the leader for the project of building the main lines (stambanorna). His proposal was that the line between Gothenburg and Stockholm (V√§stra Stambanan) should run south of Lake M√§laren to avoid competition with shipping. This was completed in 1862. He also proposed that the line between Malm√∂ and Stockholm (S√∂dra stamabanan) should go to N√§ssj√∂ and then on to Falk√∂ping, where it would meet up with V√§stra stambanan. There was a decision that, for military reasons, the railways should avoid the coasts as much as possible. The railway to Falk√∂ping was a temporary solution until √ñstra stambanan between N√§ssj√∂ and Katrineholm, which lay further up along V√§stra stambanan, could be built. Nils Ericson's proposal also included the railway between Stockholm and √Önge (Norra stambanan) and Stambanan genom √∂vre Norrland (\\"the main line through Upper Norrland\\") which runs between Br√§cke and Boden. A railway between Oslo and Lax√• (Nordv√§stra stambanan) was also planned. Lax√• lies on V√§stra stambanan. The first parts of V√§stra and S√∂dra stambanan were opened in 1856. In 1862 the whole of V√§stra stambanan was opened and in 1864 S√∂dra stambanan was opened in its entirety. Nordv√§stra stambanan was opened in 1871 and √ñstra stambanan in 1874. The Norra stambanan opened in 1881 and Stambanan genom √∂vre Norrland opened in 1894. A railway called Norrl√§ndska tv√§rbanan between Trondheim and √Önge opened in 1885. When Ericson resigned in 1862 his authority was divided between two agencies - Byggnadsbyr√•n (The Building Bureau) and Trafikbyr√•n (The Traffic Bureau). In 1888 the agencies were combined again as Kungliga J√§rnv√§gsstyrelsen (The Royal Railway Committee). =Further expansion 1891‚Äì1937= The railway building continued in 1891 when the construction of Malmbanan, an iron ore railway between Lule√• and Narvik in Norway, was begun. It was finished in 1902. In 1896 the state bought all railways on the west coast and began constructing Bohusbanan (the Bohusl√§n railway, Bohus Line) between Gothenburg and Str√∂mstad. It was intended to continue to Oslo but the dissolution of the Swedish-Norwegian Union stopped the construction of the line and Str√∂mstad became the end of the line. In 1907 the first part of the Inland Line (\\"Inlandsbanan\\") was started. In 1909 the train ferry line between Trelleborg and Sassnitz was opened, making it possible to travel directly between Berlin and Stockholm. In 1914 the railway between Norrk√∂ping (at √ñstra stambanan) and J√§rna (at V√§stra stambanan) opened, making the trip between Malm√∂ and Stockholm shorter. In 1917 a railway between Boden and Haparanda was finished, and two years later a bridge was built over the river Torne to connect Haparanda with the Finnish town of Tornio. In 1927, the East Coast Line was completed. In 1937, The Inland Railway was completed. Electrification Starting in 1895 the narrow gauge 891 mm Roslagbanan suburban railway Stockholm - Karsta was progressively electrified at 1,500 V d.c., and this was followed by the standard gauge Malmbanan, electrified at 15 kV 16.7 Hz. Malmbanan's electrification began in 1915, when it was usable between Narvik-Kiruna, and 1922 to Lule√•. V√§stra Stambanan was electrified all the way in 1926, and S√∂dra Stambanan 1933, and Norra Stambanan all the way to Boden in 1942. V√§stra Stambanan and S√∂dra Stambanan (to Katrineholm) was also upgraded to double track, finished 1964. New high speed lines from 1985 Between 1937 and 1985 no new railway was built in Sweden, except for short industry tracks and similar. Instead many lines with little traffic were closed down. Their traffic was decreasing because the car and truck traffic increased. It was decided to build double track along V√§stkustbanan, and with high speed standard, and in 1985 a new railway designed for was opened around Halmstad. In the following years several new railways were built, mostly prepared for , mostly around Stockholm and along V√§stkustbanan. The signalling system and the trains do not allow more than , and a higher speed will not be introduced before 2020. The old railways V√§stra Stambanan and S√∂dra Stambanan have also been upgraded to allow , where possible without changing the alignment, done mostly during 1985‚Äì2005. Liberalisation Sweden is the first country in Europe where it was tested strategy of separation of infrastructure and services. The reform was approached in 1988. The reform divided Statens J√§rnv√§ger State Railways (SJ) and created a new company Banverket (BV), which became the owner of the infrastructure. SJ runs trains and does so on a commercial basis without public subsidies. A decision was made in March 2009 to cancel the monopoly for SJ. Already in the autumn 2009 free competition will be allowed on Saturdays and Sundays when there is more room on the tracks, and to a full extent all days in the autumn 2010. While most current railway lines of Sweden were decided and built by the state, and receive their technical upkeep from the public as well, SJ no longer holds a monopoly on operating and owning passenger trains where such can be run profitably on a commercial basis. Large parts of the rail network serve parts of the country which don't generate enough passenger or cargo traffic to make a profit, and on some of these stretches SJ has held a de facto monopoly until very recently (2010, see below in this section) Average speed is an important factor regarding profitability (more distance per hour means more income per hour).

Subud is treated as a religious organisation in some countries, such as the UK, where it is registered as religious charity, but in other places, such as Indonesia, it is viewed by the government as an education organisation, since the government officially endorse only six religions, and religious conflicts between majority and minority are rife. It appears that Subud (along with numerous other groups with similar reservations) is forced because of conditions in some countries to register as a religion as there are no alternative categories offered for registration. Advice and Teachings Subud is sometimes said to not be a religion on the grounds it does not propound a specific teaching, nor does it insist that members adhere to any given set of beliefs. Rather, Subud practitioners may individually feel that they receive regular contact with God or some divine reality, from whom or which a kind of inner wisdom may be received directly. This formulation is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that (a) some \\"religions\\" may be described similarly, and/or (b) that many Subud members in fact propound certain beliefs as 'Subud' beliefs. In a paper published in the academic journal 'Group Dynamics: Theory, Research and Practice', Stephen C. Urlich of Lincoln University concludes: \\"In this article, I have shown that despite Subud's claims to the contrary, it does have a complex theology.\\" Stephen C. Urlich, \\"Evaluating the Charismatic Group Subud\\", Group Dynamics: Theory, Research and Practice, 2005, Vol. 9, No. 3 Universalist pluralism Another reason often given is that Subud is universalist and pluralist, welcoming members from all religions (including atheists). There do, however, exist religions which allow followers to belong to other religions as well, most notably Buddhism and Unitarian Universalism. A practical reason for this explanation arises from the fact that some religions, such as Christianity, Bah√° º√≠ Faith and Islam, do see participation in Subud as contravening their stance forbidding multiple identification. Subud practitioners have naturally sought to avoid a situation in which followers of those religions would face religious restrictions against joining Subud. Subud sometimes finds itself on the other end of this dynamic‚Äîfor example, when it recommends practitioners against \\"mixing\\" Subud with other practices such as yoga or meditation. Since yoga and meditation are major elements of Hinduism and Buddhism, some Subud members complain that this conflicts with the encouragement to practice the religion of their choice. However, the restriction is actually upon doing yoga or other meditation during the Latihan itself; i.e. mixing spiritual practices during the same half-hour. Hindu and Buddhist members are not required to give up any aspect of their religion outside of the Latihan hall. Subud is sometimes described as \\"non-denominational,\\" a curious term which usually refers to religious denominations within Christianity. \\"Non-sectarian\\" would probably be most accurate, as within Subud the mixing of religious groups goes hand in hand with the mingling of different ethnic groups from around the world.

This ruler became known through a tragic legend handed down by the historian Manetho, who reported that a calamity of some sort occurred during Semerkhet's reign. The archaeological records seem to support the view that Semerkhet had a difficult time as king and some early archaeologists even questioned the legitimacy of Semerkhet's succession to the Egyptian throne. Length of reign Manetho named Semerkhet Sem√™mps√©s and credited him with a reign of 18 years,William Gillian Waddell: Manetho (The Loeb Classical Library, Volume 350). Harvard University Press, Cambridge (Mass.) 2004 (Reprint), , page 33‚Äì37. whilst the Royal Canon of Turin credited him with an implausibly long reign of 72 years.Alan H. Gardiner: The royal Canon of Turin. Griffith Institute of Oxford, Oxford (UK) 1997, ; page 15 & Table I. Egyptologists and historians now consider both statements as exaggerations and credit Semerkhet with a reign of 8¬Ω years. This evaluation is based on the Cairo Stone inscription, where the complete reign of Semerkhet has been recorded. Additionally, they point to the archaeological records, which strengthen the view that Semerkhet had a relatively short reign.Wolfgang Helck: Untersuchungen zur Thinitenzeit. (√Ñgyptologische Abhandlungen, Volume 45), Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1987, , page 124, 160 - 162 & 212 - 214. Name sources Abydos king list Semerkhet is well attested in archaeological records. His name appears in inscriptions on vessels made of schist, alabaster, breccia, and marble. His name is also preserved on ivory tags and earthen jar seals. Objects bearing Semerkhet's name and titles come from Abydos and Sakkara.Toby A. H. Wilkinson: Early Dynastic Egypt. Routledge, London 1999, , page 78, 79 & 275. Semerkhet's serekh name is commonly translated as \\"companion of the divine community\\" or \\"thoughtful friend\\". The latter translation is questioned by many scholars, since the hieroglyph khet (Gardiner-sign F32) normally was the symbol for \\"body\\" or \\"divine community\\". Petrie Museum, UC 36756 Semerkhet's birth name is more problematic. Any artefact showing his birth name curiously lacks any artistic detail of the used hieroglyphic sign: a walking man with waving cloak or skirt, a nemes head dress, and a long, plain stick in his hands. The reading and meaning of this special sign is disputed, since it doesn't appear in this form before association with king Semerkhet. Indeed, the hieroglyph of the cloaked man is extremely rare. It appears only twice in relief inscriptions depicting ceremonial processions of priests and standard bearers. Egyptologists such as Toby Wilkinson, Bernhard Grdseloff, and Jochem Kahl read Iry-Netjer, meaning \\"divine guardian\\". During the Old Kingdom period, this word is written with uniliteral signs of a netjer flag (Gardiner-sign R8) and a human eye (Gardiner-sign D4) nearby the ideogram of the man. Some contemporary ivory tags show the Nebty name written with the single eye symbol only. Thus, the scholars also read Semerkhet's throne name as Iry (meaning \\"guardian\\") and the Nebty name as Iry-Nebty (meaning \\"guardian of the Two Ladies\\"). This reconstruction is strengthened by the observation that Semerkhet was the first king using the Nebty title in its ultimate form. For unknown reason Semerkhet did not use the Nebuy title of his predecessor. It seems that he felt connected with the 'Two Ladies', a title referring to the goddesses Nekhbet and Wadjet, the patron deities of the Ancient Egyptians who were worshiped by all after the unification of its two parts, Lower Egypt, and Upper Egypt. The Nebty title in turn was thought to function as an addition to the Nisut-Bity title. His prenomen is Nisut-Bity-Nebty-Iry, nsw.t-bty-nb.ty-irymeaning, King of Upper and Lower Egypt, he of the two ladies, and he who belongs to them or He whom the two ladies guard.Nicolas Grimal, Ian Shaw (translator): A History of Ancient Egypt, 1992, Oxford: Blackwell publishing, , p. 54 M23:t-L2:t-G16-A21A Scribes and priests of the Ramesside era were also confused, because the archaic ideogram that was used during Semerkhet's lifetime was very similar to the sign of an old man with a walking stick (Gardiner sign A19). This had been read as Semsu or Sem and means \\"the eldest\\". It was used as a title identifying someone as the head of the house. Due to this uncertainty, it seems that the compiler of the Abydos king list simply tried to imitate the original figure, whilst the author of the Royal Canon of Turin seems to have been convinced about reading it as the Gardiner- sign A19 and he wrote Semsem with uniliteral signs. The Royal Table of Sakkara omits Semerkhet's throne name. The reason for that is unknown, but all kings from Narmer up to king Den also are missing their throne names.Jochem Kahl, Markus Bretschneider, Barbara Kneissler: Fr√ºh√§gyptisches W√∂rterbuch, Band 1.

His parents are unknown, but it is thought that one of his predecessors, king Den, might have been his father. Possibly, Semerkhet was born to queen Betrest. On the Cairo Stone she is described as his mother, but definite evidence for that view has not yet been found. It would be expected that Semerkhet had sons and daughters, but their names have not been preserved in the historical record. A candidate as a possible member of his family line is his immediate successor, king Qa'a.Iorwerth Eiddon Stephen Edwards: Early History of the Middle East (The Cambridge Ancient History; Vol. 1, Pt. 2). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 2006, , page 27‚Äì31. Reign An old theory, supported by Egyptologists and historians such as Jean-Philippe Lauer, Walter Bryan Emery, Wolfgang Helck, and Michael Rice once held that Semerkhet was a usurper and not the rightful heir to the throne. Their assumption was based on the observation that a number of stone vessels with Semerkhet's name on them, originally were inscribed with king Adjib's name. Semerkhet simply erased Adjib's name and replaced it with his own. Furthermore, they point out that no high official and priest associated with Semerkhet was found at Sakkara. All other kings, such as Den and Adjib, are attested in local mastabas.Michael Rice: Egypt's Making: the Origins of Ancient Egypt, 5000-2000 BC. Taylor & Francis, London/New York 1990, , page 127. Today this theory has little support. Egyptologists such as Toby Wilkinson, I. E. S. Edwards, and Winifred Needler deny the 'usurping theory', because Semerkhet's name is mentioned on stone vessel inscriptions along with those of Den, Adjib, and Qa'a. The objects were found in the underground galleries beneath the Pyramid of Djoser at Saqqara. The inscriptions show that king Qa'a, immediate successor of Semerkhet and sponsor of the vessels, accepted Semerkhet as a rightful ancestor and heir to the throne. Furthermore, the Egyptologists point out that nearly every king of First Dynasty had the habit of taking special vessels (so-called 'anniversary vessels') from their predecessor's tomb and then replacing their predecessor's name with their own. Semerkhet not only confiscated Adjib's vessels, in his tomb several artefacts from the necropolis of queen Meritneith and king Den also were found. The lack of any high official's tomb at Saqqara might be explained by the rather short reign of Semerkhet. It seems that the only known official of Semerkhet, Henu-Ka, had survived his king: His name appears on ivory tags from Semerkhet's and Qaa's tomb. Seal impressions from Semerkhet's burial site show the new royal domain, Hor wep-khet, (meaning \\"Horus, the judge of the divine community\\") and the new private household Hut-Ipty (meaning \\"house of the harem\\"), which was headed by Semerkhet's wives. Two ivory tags show the yearly 'Escort of Horus', a feast connected to the regular tax collections. Other tags report the cult celebration for the deity of the ancestors, Wer-Wadyt (\\"the Great White\\"). And further tags show the celebration of a first (and only) Sokar feast.Eva-Maria Engel: The Domain of Semerkhet.

While the Cairo Stone reports the whole of Semerkhet's reign, unfortunately, the surface of the stone slab is badly worn and most of the events are now illegible. The following chart follows the reconstructions by Toby A. H. Wilkinson, John D. Degreef, and Hermann Alexander Schl√∂gl: Cairo Stone, main fragment: * Year of coronation: Appearance of the king of Lower- and Upper Egypt; unifying the two realms; circumambulation of the White Wall of Memphis * first year: Escort of Horus; destruction of Egypt * second year: Appearance of the king; creation of a statue for Seshat and Sed * third year: Escort of...

Nicholson: The Dictionary of Ancient Egypt. Harry N. Abrams, New York 2003, , page 202. Egyptologists and historians pay special attention to the entrance \\"Destruction of Egypt\\" in the second window of Semerkhet's year records. The inscription gives no further information about that event, but it has a resemblance to the Manetho's report. The Eusebian version says: \\"His son, Sem√©mps√™s, who reigned for 18 years; in his reign a very great calamity befell Egypt.\\" The Armenian version sounds similar: \\"Mempsis, 18 years. Under him many portents happened and a great pestilence occurred.\\" None of the documents from after Semerkhet's reign provide any details about this \\"calamity\\". Tomb Map of Semerkhet's tomb in the Umm el- Qa'ab Dieter Arnold: Lexikon der √§gyptischen Baukunst, Patmos Verlag, 2000, S. 11 Semerkhet's burial site was excavated in 1899 by archaeologist and Egyptologist Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie at Abydos and is known as \\"Tomb U\\". While excavating, Petrie found no stairways as he did at the necropolis of Den and Adjib. He found a ramp, four metres wide and leading straight into the main chamber. The ramp starts approximately ten metres east outside the tomb and has a base slope of 12¬∞. Inside the tomb the ramp shows irregular graduations. Petrie was also confused by the small number of clay seals. Only 17 seals were found. For archaeologists and Egyptologists, the complete arrangement of the burial site suggests that the builders were pressed for time. When Petrie freed the ramp from sand, he found that the complete ramp was thickly covered in aromatic oil, which still gave off a scent. Beside the ramp several wooden and hand-made baskets and earthen jars were found. These were dated to the Ramesside era. Scholars now think that Semerkhet's tomb was re-opened and restored when Ramesside priests and kings saw the tomb of king Djer as the ritual burial of Osiris's head. The findings inside the main chamber included precious objects such as inlays and fragments of furniture (especially pedestals), copper-made armatures, and jewelry made of ebony, amethyst, and turquoise. Some vessels originating from the Levant also were found. They once contained Bescha oil, which was of great value to the Egyptians. Outside the tomb, close to the entrance, a damaged tomb stela made of black granite displaying Semerkhet's serekh name was excavated.G. Dreyer, A. Effland, U. Effland, E.M. Engel, H. Hartmann, R. Hartung, Lacher, M√ºller, Pokorny: Excavations in the Tomb of Semerkhet. In: Mitteilungen des Deutschen Arch√§ologischen Institut Kairo, vol. 62. von Zabern, Mainz 2006, page 95-97. The burial chamber measures 29.2 √ó 20.8 metres and is of simple construction. Petrie found that the king's mastaba once covered the whole of the subsidiary tombs. Now the royal burial formed a unit with the 67 subsidiary tombs. Egyptologists such as Walter Bryan Emery and Toby Wilkinson see this architectural development as proof that the royal family and household were killed willingly when their royal family head had died. Wilkinson goes further and thinks that Semerkhet, as the godlike king, tried to demonstrate his power over the death and life of his servants and family members even in their afterlife. The tradition of burying the family and court of the king when he died was abandoned at the time of king Qaa, one of the last rulers of the First Dynasty. The tombs of Second Dynasty founder, Hotepsekhemwy, onward have no subsidiary tombs.Walter Bryan Emery: √Ñgypten, Geschichte und Kultur der Fr√ºhzeit, 3200-2800 v. Chr.

Through love and telepathic communication, Lilith teaches him human language and customs. Later, both retire from the Teen Titans to live together, apparently as a couple.

The readers never found out what Gnarrk's final fate was, Pre-Crisis. =Post- Crisis= Gnarrk's story began thousands of years ago. Gnarrk was a nineteen- year-old Cro-Magnon who was fascinated by the lights in the skies. One night, a comet crashed before him, embedding a chunk of crystal into his chest. Somehow, this caused a transformation in him ‚Äî it expanded his mind and his understanding. Soon, a volcanic disturbance threatened Gnarrk. The jewel in his chest protected him by encasing him in ice. Centuries passed, and Gnarrk remained in his ice tomb. During that time, his mind still worked, and Gnarrk dreamed of a better world. He used his abilities to cure disease and control the forces of nature to benefit mankind. Based on psychic flashes from Lilith, the Teen Titans traveled to Southeast Asia, where they eventually found Gnarrk still encased in ice. He sensed Lilith's presence and called out to her. Lilith used her powers to establish a mental rapport with Gnarrk. He told her his name, and she found out his true origins and his noble intentions. Although Lilith was dating Don Hall (Dove) at the time, she nonetheless found herself attracted to the gentle soul. The Titans brought Gnarrk back to S.T.A.R. Labs. It was established that he was dying. The S.T.A.R. scientists wanted to dissect him, but the Titans prevented them from doing so. Gnarrk remained on life support for almost a year with Lilith by his side. Gnarrk's light in his chest eventually faded, and he died. When S.T.A.R. scientists performed an autopsy, they found the stone no longer had any special abilities.

He lives in the Arctic Circle with his best friend, Kole, in a vast series of caverns that are inhabited by prehistoric creatures. All Gnarrk could say was \\"gnarrk\\", yet Kole could understand him and communicate with him quite well; he also seems to have a crush on her. Stemming from bad experiences with the modern world, Gnarrk suffers from a major technophobia. He and Kole first appear where they save the Teen Titans from a pack of Velociraptors. Gnarrk helped the Titans stop Dr. Light when he attempted to kidnap Kole. Cyborg was never able to pronounce his name right (but did in \\"Calling all Titans\\"), and always had to be corrected by Kole or his teammates.

Its name means \\"middle,\\" denoting its location in the middle of the island. At its greatest extent, it included all of County Meath (which takes its name from the kingdom), all of Westmeath, and parts of Cavan, Dublin, Kildare, Longford, Louth and Offaly. History Mide originally referred to the area around the Hill of Uisneach in County Westmeath, where the festival of Beltaine was celebrated. The larger province of Meath, between the Irish Sea and the Shannon, is traditionally said to have been created by T√∫athal Techtmar, an exemplar king, in the first century from parts of the other four provinces. In the fourth and fifth centuries its territories were taken over by the U√≠ N√©ill from Connacht and they pushed out Laigin tribes. The U√≠ N√©ill assumed the ancient titles of Kings of Uisnech in Mide and Kings of Tara in Brega and claimed a cattle-tribute, the B√≥roma Laigen, on the Laigin. The U√≠ Failge, under Failge Berraide, were finally expelled from the plain of Mide with the battle of Druim Derg in 514. The U√≠ Enechglaiss were an early paramount dynasty of the Laigin. An ogham stone found south of Slane suggests they controlled the Brega area in County Meath together with Carbury Hill and the plains of Kildare. During the early 6th century, they were expelled across the Wicklow Mountains. The U√≠ Failge and U√≠ Bairrche belonged to the Laigin but may also be associated with the Iverni. In medieval Ireland, the Kings of Mide were of the Clann Cholm√°in, a branch of the U√≠ N√©ill. They came to dominate their Southern U√≠ N√©ill kindreds, including the S√≠l n√Åedo Sl√°ine in County Meath, the U√≠ Failghe and U√≠ Faelain tribes of the Laigin and the Kingdom of Dublin. Several were High Kings of Ireland. The position alternated with their kindred the Northern U√≠ N√©ill for many centuries. The kingdom came under pressure in the 11th and 12th century from other provincial kings seeking the position of High King of Ireland and the Kingdom of Breifne under Tigern√°n Ua Ruairc. Mide was frequently overrun and partitioned and began to collapse as a coherent kingdom. Following the Norman invasion of Ireland, in 1172, the kingdom was awarded to Hugh de Lacy as the Lordship of Meath by Henry II of England in his capacity as Lord of Ireland. De Lacy took possession of the kingdom and the dynasty of the Ua Mael Sechlainn or O Melaghlins were forced west and settled on the east bank of the River Shannon in the barony of Clonlonan. Bearers of the name were noted as among the Gaelic nobility as late as the 1690s, though they had lost power long before. Melaugh is the more commonly associated name in Ireland today, though it is more often rendered McLoughlin. Province and diocese Meath is also considered to have been one of five Provinces ( meaning \\"fifths\\") of Ireland, along with the four current provinces of Connacht, Leinster, Munster and Ulster. The Diocese of Meath established by the Synod of R√°th Breasail in 1111 had boundaries similar to those of the kingdom.

The relationship between tree and ant may persist for more than 800 years. A devil's garden is considered an example of mutualism, a type of symbiotic relationship between species.  Background  Devil's gardens got their name because locals believed that an evil forest spirit Chullachaki (meaning \\"uneven foot, single foot\\" in Kichwa) or Chuyathaqi lived in them.Pablo Amaringo: Ayahuasca Visions - \\"a vision of the Supay-chacra or garden of the Chullachaki.\\"BBC News: Devilish ants control the garden. 21 September 2005.

In southeastern Peru, devil's gardens are dominated by Cordia nodosa (Boraginaceae) and occasionally mixed with Tococa occidentalis (Melastomataceae). At higher elevations, the tree species Tapirira guianensis (Anacardiaceae) can be found dominating gardens. In southeastern Ecuador and northeastern Peru the most common tree species found in devil's gardens are Duroia hirsuta (Rubiaceae).  Symbiosis  domatia of Cordia nodosa (Boraginaceae). The mutualistic symbiosis between the ant Myrmelachista schumanni and the tree Duroia hirsuta begins when an ant queen colonizes an isolated tree. The ants make nesting sites in the hollow stems and leaves of the tree, called domatia. The ants eliminate competition for the tree by poisoning all plants, except the host tree, with formic acid. Because other plants are killed off, D. hirsuta saplings are able to grow and the ant colony is able to expand. The tree provides shelter (hollow stems and domatia) and food (leaves) for the ants, and the ants provide a suitable environment for the trees to grow by eliminating competing plants. Although the ants fend off herbivores, the size of the garden is restricted by leaf destruction increasing as it expands, as the ants are unable to defend the trees beyond a certain point.

He was an adviser to Cao Cao, the warlord who became the de facto head of the Han central government during that period. He died in December 220 ‚Äì a few months after Cao Cao's son, Cao Pi, usurped the throne from Emperor Xian (the last Han emperor) and established the state of Cao Wei, an event marking the start of the Three Kingdoms period in China. Cheng Yu was described as a tall man (approximately 1.91 metres) with a beautiful long beard.(Èï∑ÂÖ´Â∞∫‰∏âÂØ∏ÔºåÁæéÈ†àÈ´Ø„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 14. He was from Dong'e County in present-day Shandong. He was best known in his time for his abnormal approach to cope with a shortage of grain: instead of sending hostages to Cao Cao's rival, Yuan Shao, in exchange for food supplies, he advised Cao Cao to feed his army with human flesh.(‰∏ñËØ≠Êõ∞ÔºöÂàùÔºåÂ§™Á•ñ‰πèÈ£üÔºåÊò±Áï•ÂÖ∂Êú¨ÂéøÔºå‰æõ‰∏âÊó•Á≤ÆÔºåÈ¢áÊùÇ‰ª•‰∫∫ËÑØÔºåÁî±ÊòØÂ§±ÊúùÊúõÔºåÊïÖ‰Ωç‰∏çËá≥ÂÖ¨„ÄÇ) Wei Jin Shiyu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 14. He was also noted for his expertise in military tactics, which helped Cao Cao defeat Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu in 200 and consolidate control over northern China. It is widely agreed that his numerous contributions laid the foundation of the Cao Wei state; the reason he was not promoted to the rank of a duke was only because of his aforementioned strategy to cope with the food shortage in Yan Province. After Cheng Yu's death, Cao Pi honoured him with the posthumous title \\"Marquis Su\\", meaning \\"solemn marquis\\".(ÂâõÂæ∑ÂÖãÂ∞±Êõ∞ËÇÖ„ÄÇÂü∑ÂøÉÊ±∫Êñ∑Êõ∞ËÇÖ) Hardhearted or determined person might receive the posthumous title of \\"Su\\". Cheng Yu qualified for both criteria. See the Lost Book of Zhou for the rules on assigning a posthumous name in ancient China. Incidents in hometown Cheng Yu's original given name was \\"Li\\" () but he changed it to \\"Yu\\" (Êò±; literally \\"lifting the sun\\") after he had a dream about the sun on top of Mount Tai. He was from Dong'e County, which is in present- day Shandong. There is nothing recorded in history about his early life; he was known for his courage in the areas around his hometown when he was in his early 40s. When the Yellow Turban Rebellion broke out in the 180s, a county magistrate, Wang Du, burnt down the food stored in the warehouse and instigated his subordinates to seize the city. The county prefect escaped the city and went into hiding, while the town residents took their families eastward and camped beside a mountain. After receiving intelligence from his spies that Wang Du had moved out and camped 1.3 to 1.6 miles away from the city, Cheng Yu reported to and told a local parvenu, Xue Fang, that Wang Du must not have the ability to control the situation, so they should retrieve the prefect and reoccupy the city. Xue Fang agreed to Cheng Yu's plan, yet the commoners refused to comply, wherein Cheng Yu angrily said: \\"Stupid commoners lack the ability to plan.\\" He then plotted with Xue Fang, and secretly sent several cavalry holding streamers to the hilltop, where they rode down toward the civilians. Xue Fang and his men then screamed upon seeing the riders, making the commoners mistake them for Yellow Turban rebels.(ÂØÜÈÅ£Êï∏È®éËàâÂπ°ÊñºÊù±Â±±‰∏äÔºå‰ª§ÊàøÁ≠âÊúõË¶ãÔºåÂ§ßÂëºË®Ä„ÄåË≥äÂ∑≤Ëá≥„ÄçÔºå‰æø‰∏ãÂ±±Ë∂£ÂüéÔºåÂêèÊ∞ëÂ•îËµ∞Èö®‰πã) Sanguozhi vol. 14. Led by Xue Fang, the mass kept running until back into the city, where they realised that the rebels were not so terrifying and started to defend the city with the prefect, whom Cheng Yu found later. Seeing the inhabitants had come back, Wang Du launched an attack, but was foiled by Cheng Yu's defences. After some time, Wang Du could no longer hold on and intended to move elsewhere. Cheng Yu then led a sudden attack when Wang Du was packing, dealing him a major blow which enabled the survival of Dong'e County. In 192, Liu Dai, the Inspector of Yan Province, invited Cheng Yu to join his administration but Cheng Yu refused. At the beginning, Liu Dai had very good relationship with the warlords Yuan Shao and Gongsun Zan, wherein Yuan Shao sent his family to reside with Liu Dai while Gongsun Zan sent a detachment of elite cavalry to help Liu Dai fight the Yellow Turbans in the area; however, Yuan Shao and Gongsun Zan became bitter enemies later, and were way more powerful than Liu Dai, who was forced to pick a side. Liu Dai then sought advice from Cheng Yu, who told the former that asking for help from Gongsun Zan was like requesting someone to save a drowning child from afar.(„ÄåËã•Ê£ÑÁ¥πËøëÊè¥ËÄåÊ±ÇÁìöÈÅ†Âä©ÔºåÊ≠§ÂÅá‰∫∫ÊñºË∂ä‰ª•ÊïëÊ∫∫Â≠ê‰πãË™™‰πü„ÄÇ„Äç) Sanguozhi vol. 14. He further analysed that Gongsun Zan, who had recently gained a minor military victory over Yuan Shao, would eventually lose to the latter. Therefore, it was not wise to enjoy a short-term benefit without a careful long-term plan. Liu Dai agreed with Cheng Yu's speech and severed ties with Gongsun Zan, who ordered his cavalry in Yan Province to return to his base in You Province. Just as Cheng Yu had predicted, Gongsun Zan soon suffered a heavy defeat by Yuan Shao before his cavalry could even join the battle. Liu Dai then asked Cheng Yu to become his officer, and offered him the position of a Cavalry Commandant, but Cheng Yu again refused employment. Coming to serve Cao Cao However, without the assistance from Gongsun Zan's elite cavalry, Liu Dai was soon killed by the Yellow Turbans, and Cao Cao came forth to take over the province. Upon his arrival, Cao Cao sent Cheng Yu a letter concerning his presence in the government. Cheng Yu replied to Cao Cao that he accepted the offer right away, so the commoners asked Cheng Yu: \\"How can you change your attitude so snobbishly?\\" Cheng Yu laughed at them without comment. When Cheng Yu joined Cao Cao, he was only assigned as a prefect, a position far lower than the ones Liu Dai offered him in the past. Still, Cheng Yu was determined to follow Cao Cao, as evidenced by his defences against the warlord L√º Bu, who attacked Cao Cao's base while the latter was away on a campaign in Xu Province. Performance in L√º Bu's invasion When L√º Bu claimed his rule over Yan Province, many people gave up resistance and joined him; only Juancheng, Dong'e and Fan counties did not yield. At the time, Cheng Yu was guarding Juancheng with Cao Cao's chief strategist, Xun Yu, who analysed that the defences could only be successful if the officials guarding the three counties worked together. Xun Yu then asked Cheng Yu to oversee the defence of Dong'e County because he could probably convince his hometown to fight with him. Thus, Xun Yu stayed behind to watch over the fortress, and Cheng Yu went to Dong'e County. On his way, Cheng Yu passed by Fan County, where Si Yi (), an official under L√º Bu, was trying to persuade the prefect of Fan County to switch allegiance to his lord. Cheng Yu sought a meeting with the prefect and managed to persuade him to reject and kill Si Yi. When he arrived at Dong'e County, Xue Ti () and Zao Zhi () had already set up defences around the area, so Cheng Yu split his cavalry force out to take control of Cangting ford to block the advances of L√º Bu's strategist, Chen Gong. Xue Ti then formulated a strategy with Cheng Yu, which enabled the defences of the three counties until Cao Cao returned from Xu Province.(ÂÖóÂ∑ûÂæû‰∫ãËñõÊÇåËàáÊò±ÂçîË¨ÄÔºåÂçíÂÆå‰∏âÂüéÔºå‰ª•ÂæÖÂ§™Á•ñ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 14. The year 194 was a hard time for Cao Cao, because in addition to losing several battles to L√º Bu around Puyang, a widespread famine also broke out in Yan Province (but this also forced L√º Bu to retreat). For once, Cao Cao thought about relinquishing his position in Yan Province, and prepared to surrender to Yuan Shao. Nevertheless, Cheng Yu rebuked Cao Cao by saying that he had a calibre greater than just being a subject under Yuan Shao, and it was shameful for a genius to submit to a man who only enjoyed an overvalued fame. Cheng Yu said to Cao Cao: \\"Even a mere warrior like Tian Heng knew about shame, how could you act so shamefully to surrender to Yuan Shao?\\" However, Cheng Yu's heroic speech was way easier to say than to do, because Cao Cao's army had already been running out of food. Nevertheless, not wanting to be disgraced, Cao Cao appeared to listen to Cheng Yu, but asked him to prepare three days' worth of supplies. Unprepared to be asked to deal with this problem, Cheng Yu insanely devised a very vicious strategy: he personally led an armed force to pillage his hometown and abducted his townsfolk, who would then be slaughtered like pigs for Cao Cao's army to feed on. Liu Bei's betrayal After L√º Bu was forced to abandon Yan Province, Cheng Yu and Xun Yu advised Cao Cao to escort Emperor Xian, who was in dire straits, into territory under Cao Cao's control. After Emperor Xian made it to Xuchang (Cao Cao's base) from Luoyang, Cheng Yu was appointed as a Master of Writing in the Han central government but was soon promoted to be East General of the Household and appointed as the Administrator of Jiyin Commandery. In 198, L√º Bu took Xu Province from Liu Bei, who surrendered to Cao Cao for protection. Cheng Yu told Cao Cao that Liu Bei was an ambitious man with many admirers and that he would not be a subject for long, so he should be taken care of as soon as possible. Cao Cao refused under the rationale that he did not want the death of one individual to affect the decision of others who might yield to the Han central government.(ÂëÇÂ∏ÉË•≤ÂäâÂÇôÔºåÂèñ‰∏ãÈÇ≥„ÄÇÂÇô‰æÜÂ•î„ÄÇÁ®ãÊò±Ë™™ÂÖ¨Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåËßÄÂäâÂÇôÊúâÈõÑÊâçËÄåÁîöÂæóË°ÜÂøÉÔºåÁµÇ‰∏çÁÇ∫‰∫∫‰∏ãÔºå‰∏çÂ¶ÇÊó©Âúñ‰πã„ÄÇ„ÄçÂÖ¨Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊñπ‰ªäÊî∂Ëã±ÈõÑÊôÇ‰πüÔºåÊÆ∫‰∏Ä‰∫∫ËÄåÂ§±Â§©‰∏ã‰πãÂøÉÔºå‰∏çÂèØ„ÄÇ„Äç) Sanguozhi vol. 1. The following year, Cao Cao, Sun Ce and others defeated the warlord Yuan Shu, who then attempted to head north to join his half-brother, Yuan Shao. Liu Bei volunteered to intercept Yuan Shu and was granted a sizable army to do his job. When Cheng Yu heard the news, he rushed to Cao Cao and protested: \\"It's arguable you turned down our suggestion to kill Liu Bei earlier, but it's a certainty that he will betray you if lent a force.\\"(ÂÖ¨ÂâçÊó•‰∏çÂõæÂ§áÔºåÊò±Á≠âËØö‰∏çÂèä‰πü„ÄÇ‰ªäÂÄü‰πã‰ª•ÂÖµÔºåÂøÖÊúâÂºÇÂøÉ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 14. Thus, Cao Cao regretted upon his decision and sent an envoy to call the troops back, but it was already too late. Liu Bei led his army east to Xu Province, killed Che Zhou (ËªäËÉÑ; the provincial governor appointed by Cao Cao) and seized control of the province. Cao Cao's northern campaign When Yuan Shao defeated Gongsun Zan and congregated the four provinces north of the Yellow River, he assembled an army of over 100,000 to declare war against Cao Cao. Cheng Yu was made a general and was stationed in Juancheng with 700 soldiers. Cao Cao then sent a letter to Cheng Yu and asserted to Cheng Yu that he would send 2,000 men as reinforcements. However, Cheng Yu replied: \\"Yuan Shao has 100,000 men and considers himself invincible. If he sees I only have such a small army, he will not attack easily. On the contrary, if my position is strong (enough to threaten his movement), then he will not be able to pass me by without attacking; if he attacks, he'll surely win, so it will be a mere waste to send in reinforcement. I hope you could understand my rationale and don't doubt on that.\\"(Ë¢ÅÁªçÊã•ÂçÅ‰∏á‰ºóÔºåËá™‰ª•ÊâÄÂêëÊó†Ââç„ÄÇ‰ªäËßÅÊò±ÂÖµÂ∞ëÔºåÂøÖËΩªÊòì‰∏çÊù•Êîª„ÄÇËã•ÁõäÊò±ÂÖµÔºåËøáÂàô‰∏çÂèØ‰∏çÊîªÔºåÊîª‰πãÂøÖÂÖãÔºåÂæí‰∏§ÊçüÂÖ∂Âäø„ÄÇÂéüÂÖ¨Êó†ÁñëÔºÅ) Sanguozhi vol. 14. Cao Cao was happy that he did not need to send additional troops to Cheng Yu, and was able to defeat Liu Bei in Xu Province within a short time. Three years after Cao Cao defeated Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu, Cheng Yu recruited and enlisted several thousand robbers and inhabitants of deep hills around Yan Province, and led them to rendezvous with Cao Cao in Liyang, where Cao Cao had set up a front line military operation base against Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang. Along with Li Dian, Cheng Yu transported grain to Cao Cao by ships. Once, the supply line was blocked by Gao Fan, the Administrator of Wei Commandery, who capitalised on the geographic advantage. Cao Cao then ordered Cheng Yu to abandon the waterway and transport through other routes. However, Li Dian reasoned with Cheng Yu that Gao Fan could be defeated because he was lightly guarded with a small army. Therefore, they violated Cao Cao's order, and landed the northern bank and defeated Gao Fan, resulting in the smooth delivery of military necessities. Battle of Red Cliffs In 208, Cao Cao accepted the surrender of Liu Cong, the governor of Jing Province, and sent a letter to the eastern warlord, Sun Quan, to inform the latter that he had assembled an 800,000 strong force in Jiangling, and was eager to meet Sun Quan in person. The majority believed that Sun Quan would surely kill Liu Bei and submit to Cao Cao, but Cheng Yu correctly analysed that Sun Quan would support Liu Bei to fight a desperate war.(ÊõπÂÖ¨Êó†ÊïåÊñºÂ§©‰∏ãÔºåÂàù‰∏æËçÜÂ∑ûÔºåÂ®ÅÈúáÊ±üË°®ÔºåÊùÉËôΩÊúâË∞ãÔºå‰∏çËÉΩÁã¨ÂΩì‰πü„ÄÇÂàòÂ§áÊúâËã±Âêç ... ÊùÉÂøÖËµÑ‰πã‰ª•Âæ°Êàë„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 14. However, due to the fact that Cao Cao enjoyed an absolute advantage both in terms of military and economy; therefore he did not take Cheng Yu's counsel seriously, and Cao Cao held lavish banquets on his warships from time to time. Out of negligence, none of Cao Cao's officers knew that the wind direction would change a few days per year along the Yangtze River, and so they thought that the direction of the wind gave Cao Cao's side the advantage. While Cao Cao was certain that the allied forces could not make use of a fire attack, nevertheless the enemy commander, Zhou Yu, had Cao Cao's grand fleet reduced to ashes overnight. Advice to Cao Pi When Cao Cao went west to fight against Ma Chao and Han Sui, Cheng Yu was assigned as a strategist to Cao Cao's son Cao Pi, who was in charge of the capital. During the time that Cao Cao went west, some local gentries in Hejian Commandery rebelled. When Cao Pi sent a general to subdue the revolt, several thousand rebels offered to surrender after being besieged. A meeting was held within the court to decide whether the surrender of the rebels should be accepted or not. Many participants of the discussion proposed to reject the surrender, because Cao Cao once issued a fiat that those who surrendered after being besieged should be executed. Cheng Yu opposed and said, \\"The reason why Cao Cao set such an expedient rule was that he was fighting against numerous enemies in a chaotic time. To execute those who surrender after being besieged could intimidate other potential enemies, and encouraged early submissions; subsequently, we did not need to lay siege every time. However, the territory under our control is now stabilised, and this battle happens within our own domain; so therefore these kinds of enemies will surely surrender, and killing them will not threaten other enemies. Thus, to kill the rebels now is not the primary focus of Cao Cao's rule. I suggest that their surrender be accepted; if you must execute them, then please inform master Cao first.\\"(ËØõÈôçËÄÖÔºåË∞ìÂú®Êâ∞Êîò‰πãÊó∂ÔºåÂ§©‰∏ã‰∫ëËµ∑ÔºåÊïÖÂõ¥ËÄåÂêéÈôçËÄÖ‰∏çËµ¶Ôºå ‰ª•Á§∫Â®ÅÂ§©‰∏ãÔºåÂºÄÂÖ∂Âà©Ë∑ØÔºå‰Ωø‰∏çËá≥ÊñºÂõ¥‰πü„ÄÇ‰ªäÂ§©‰∏ãÁï•ÂÆöÔºå‰∏îÂú®ÈÇ¶Âüü‰πã‰∏≠ÔºåÊ≠§ÂøÖÈôç‰πãË¥ºÔºåÊùÄ‰πãÊó†ÊâÄÂ®ÅÊÉßÔºåÈùûÂâçÊó•ËØõÈôç‰πãÊÑè„ÄÇËá£‰ª•‰∏∫‰∏çÂèØËØõ‰πüÔºõÁ∫µËØõ‰πãÔºåÂÆúÂÖàÂêØÈóª„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 14. The feckless audience simply ignored Cheng Yu's rationale, and vindicated their choice by claiming that they had the autonomy over military issues and that it was not necessary to report every single provision. Cheng Yu remained in silence and the officers left the meeting. After the exodus, Cao Pi specifically consulted Cheng Yu to see if he held any thought back in the discussion, wherein Cheng Yu replied, \\"The reason why Commandants and Commanders were given autonomic power is because frontline military issues are so imminent that decisions must be made immediately. But the surrendered rebels are enfettered by your general, and have no way to mutiny. That is why I don't want to see you use (abuse) your authority. Feeling delighted by Cheng Yu's support, Cao Pi changed his mind and reported the issue to Cao Cao, who ordered the surrendered rebels to be spared. As Cheng Yu expected, the bond between Cao Pi and his father, Cao Cao was strengthened as a result of their correspondence. After Cao Cao returned from his expedition, he particularly expressed his gratitude to Cheng Yu by claiming Cheng Yu to be an intelligent man who not only excelled in tactics but also knew how to manage the relationship between father and son.(ÂêõÈùûÂæíÊòéÊñºÂÜõËÆ°ÔºåÂèàÂñÑÂ§Ñ‰∫∫Áà∂Â≠ê‰πãÈó¥„ÄÇ) Weilue annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 14. Later life and death Cheng Yu went into semi-retirement after losing to his political rival, Xing Zhen (ÈÇ¢Ë≤û).(Ëàá‰∏≠Â∞âÈÇ¢Ë≤ûÁà≠Â®ÅÂÑÄÔºåÂÖç„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 14. What was worse for him was that much invectives were done to Cheng Yu after his downfall, and someone even accused him of harbouring the intention of rebelling, but Cao Cao did not further investigate his once trusted aide; in contrast, he gave Cheng Yu more monetary rewards. Cheng Yu remained as a commoner and seldom left his home until Cao Pi usurped the throne from Emperor Xian in 220. Cheng Yu was re- instituted as the Minister of the Guards and earned a tax revenue from a marquisate composed of 800 taxable households. Since Cao Pi intended to make Cheng Yu a duke, a discussion was made in regard to the issue, but Cheng Yu died before the decision would be settled. He was given the posthumous title \\"Marquis Su\\" for his inviolable reverence (See Xing Zhen's case in the following section). Both his young son Cheng Yan and grandson Cheng Xiao were made Marquis, and Cheng Yu was succeeded by his eldest son, Cheng Wu () after death. His grandson Cheng Xiao became a well-known scholar later. Appraisal Despite being famous for his paradoxes, Cheng Yu tended to belittle others in his speeches. For once, he inveighed Cao Cao as inferior to the likes of Tian Heng (), who was a mere warrior, when he tried to dissuade Cao Cao from surrendering to Yuan Shao. He also used to call his townsfolk \\"stupid commoners\\". Cheng Yu was a recalcitrant old man, and his hidebound characteristic compelled him to quarrel with others on a frequent basis. There is a quaint incident about how he entered a predicament when he offended Xing Zhen. When Cao Cao was first enfeoffed as a vassal by Emperor Xian, he appointed Cheng Yu as the Minister of the Guards () in his vassal state, while Xing Zhen was appointed as the Commandant of the Capital (). However, Cheng Yu had a rabid quirk in pontificating his dominance, and he purposely flaunted in front of Xing Zhen, who reported his invidious behaviour to Cao Cao. As punishment, Cheng Yu was stripped of his position. Although ingeniously intelligent, Cheng Yu was of a perverse and hardhearted nature.(Êò±ÊÄßÂâõÊàæ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 14. Once, he ransacked his hometown, Dong'e County, and kidnapped his own townfolk to feed Cao Cao's army in an act of cannibalism. It was recorded that Cheng Yu would have the abducted cut into pieces to mix with rice, so the soldiers would enjoy their prized meals. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms In the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Cheng Yu offered a ruse in order to get Xu Shu to serve Cao Cao. At the time Xu Shu was serving as rival Liu Bei's key strategist and managed to score a major victory against Cao Cao's officers L√º Kuang (), L√º Xiang () and Cao Ren. Exploiting the fact that Xu Shu was an extremely filial son, Cheng Yu suggested to Cao Cao that Cao Cao hold Xu Shu's mother hostage and force Xu Shu to leave Liu Bei and serve Cao Cao. Cheng Yu wrote a fake letter to Xu Shu and successfully tricked Xu Shu to come to Xuchang. Ironically, Xu Shu's mother committed suicide after seeing her son fall for such a ruse and leaving a righteous person like Liu Bei to serve under the ruthless Cao Cao. Prior to the Battle of Red Cliffs, Cheng Yu had predicted that Sun Quan's forces would use fire to attack Cao Cao's naval fleet. However, Cao Cao did not heed his advice seriously as the winds were to their advantage then. After Cao Cao's major defeat, Cheng Yu was one of the few advisers who stood by Cao Cao all the way during their escape.

A close friend of Thomas Jefferson, Mazzei acted as an agent to purchase arms for Virginia during the American Revolutionary War. Biography Mazzei was born Filippo Mazzei in Poggio a Caiano (Prato) in Tuscany as a son of Domenico and Elisabetta. He studied medicine in Florence and practiced in Italy and the Middle East for several years before moving to London in 1755 to take up a mercantile career as an importer. In London he worked as a teacher of Italian language. While in London he met the Americans Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson of Virginia. While doing work for Franklin, Mazzei shared his idea of importing Tuscan products, wine and olive trees, to the New World. They convinced him to undertake his next venture. On September 2, 1773 Mazzei boarded a ship from Livorno to Virginia bringing with him plants, seeds, silkworms, and 10 farmers from Lucca. While visiting Jefferson at his estate, the two became good friends and Jefferson gave Mazzei a large allotment of land for an experimental plantation. Mazzei and Jefferson started what became the first commercial vineyard in the Commonwealth of Virginia. They shared an interest in politics and liberal values, and maintained an active correspondence for the rest of Mazzei's life. In 1779 Mazzei returned to Italy as a secret agent for Virginia. He purchased and shipped arms to them until 1783. After briefly visiting the United States again in 1785, Mazzei travelled throughout Europe promoting republican ideals. He wrote a political history of the American Revolution, Recherches historiques et politiques sur les Etats- Unis de l'Amerique septentrionale, and published it in Paris in 1788. After its publication Mazzei became an unofficial roving ambassador in Europe for American ideas and institutions. While in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth he became attached as a Privy Councilor at the court of King Stanislaus II. There he became acquainted with Polish liberal and constitutional thought, like the works of Wawrzyniec Grzyma≈Ça Go≈õlicki and ideas of Golden Freedoms and Great Sejm. King Stanislaus appointed Mazzei to be Poland's representative in Paris, where he again met Jefferson. After Poland was partitioned between Russia and Prussia in 1795, Mazzei, along with the rest of the Polish court, was given a pension by the Russian crown. He later spent more time in France, becoming active in the politics of the French Revolution under the Directorate. When Napoleon overthrew that government Mazzei returned to Pisa, Italy. He died there in 1816. After his death the remainder of his family returned to the United States at the urging of Jefferson. They settled in Massachusetts and Virginia; Mazzei's daughter married a nephew of John Adams. He was buried at the Pisa Suburbano Cemetery in Pisa. Mazzei letter Many biographers believe Jefferson and George Washington had a falling out over a letter Jefferson sent to Mazzei in Italy, which called the Washington Administration \\"Anglican, monarchical, and aristocratical,\\" and claimed that Washington had appointed as military officers \\"all timid men that prefer the calm of despotism to the boisterous sea of liberty ... [I]t would give you a fever were I to name to you the apostates who have gone over to these heresies, men who were Samsons in the field and Solomons in the council, but who have had their heads shorn by the harlot England.\\" The letter was eventually published overseas and then re-translated back into English by Noah Webster and published in the United States.\\"Jefferson's Letter to Philip Mazzei\\", The Papers of Thomas Jefferson, princeton.edu; accessed October 21, 2014. Acknowledgment The contribution of Philip Mazzei to the Declaration of Independence was acknowledged by John F. Kennedy in his book A Nation of Immigrants, in which he states that:Kennedy, John F. A Nation of Immigrants, pp. 15‚Äì16 Legacy A 40-cent United States airmail stamp was issued in 1980 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Mazzei's birth.

A New South Wales State of Origin and Australian international representative second-row-forward, he played his club football in Australia with the Sydney Roosters and the South Sydney Rabbitohs, before a stint in England with Wigan. He is also known to have the biggest head man has ever seen. Sydney Roosters Fletcher's junior club was the Paddington Colts in the Eastern Suburbs District Junior Rugby League. He started his top-level career at the Sydney Roosters in the second row in the 1997 ARL season. Despite only 24 National Rugby League appearances, Fletcher was selected for the Australian team to compete in the end of season 1999 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament. In the final against New Zealand he played at second-row forward in the Kangaroos' 22-20 victory. Over the years Fletcher would gain 13 caps for the Australian national side and also play 14 games for New South Wales in the State of Origin matches. One of the highlights of Fletcher's Sydney Roosters career was his appearance at second-row forward in the 2000 NRL Grand Final, their first in 20 years. He also helped Australia inflict a humiliating defeat on the New Zealand national team 52‚Äì0 as well as a 3‚Äì0 whitewash of Queensland in the State of Origin series. Fletcher is perhaps best known in Origin circles for his hand grenade try celebration which he performed in 2000 series where NSW thumped QLD 56-16. It is believed that the try celebration forced Queensland to change their whole strategy towards Origin and it created a pathway for Queensland to win eleven of fourteen series since 2006 (and a record eight straight between 2006 and 2013). Former Queensland player Wendell Sailor said ‚ÄúAs a Queenslander, you never forget that\\". Queensland Origin great Gorden Tallis had previously spoken about how that try celebration eventually led to a shift in the State of Origin balance of power which saw Queensland win back the Shield in 2001. Former player Matthew Johns claims that the try celebration started a Queensland dynasty. Former Queensland coach Chris Close spoke about Fletcher's try celebration in 2016 \\"I thought it was disgraceful act and a disgraceful show of disrespect, You would certainly never, ever see that from any Queensland team, It still burns. F---ing oath it does\\".https://www.news.com.au/sport/nrl/origin-greats-come-clean-over-famous- insult/news- story/0a9398a515462e7ae65d9884b1f4ef66http://www.espn.co.uk/nrl/story/_/id/16348734/origin- grenade-disgraceful-show-disrespect-says-close Fletcher achieved even more success in the 2002 season. He played for the Roosters from the interchange bench in their 30-8 win over the New Zealand Warriors in the 2002 NRL Grand Final in front of 80,130 fans at the Telstra Stadium. It was Fletcher's final appearance for the club (making a total of 125 appearances for the red, white and blue) before moving to rivals the South Sydney Rabbitohs. South Sydney Rabbitohs Fletcher left the Roosters and moved to perennial strugglers the South Sydney Rabbitohs in 2003. Fletcher was soon installed as the club's captain after signing due to his playing pedigree. In 2003 he won the George Piggins Medal as the club's best and fairest player of the season. The Rabbitohs' captaincy was stripped from him after an altercation on the pitch with Parramatta Eels player Dean Widders in which Fletcher made a racially based comment towards Widders. It turned out to be the turning point in the Rabbitohs' season, with Ashley Harrison taking the captaincy from him and the Rabbitohs winning most of their matches under him in a late season surge which saw them avoid a third consecutive wooden spoon. He later apologised for the event, saying: \\"I apologise unreservedly for comments that I made to Dean Widders in yesterday's game. The comments were totally unacceptable and for that I am sorry. \\"My actions have set a very poor example for kids who follow Rugby League and these types of comments cannot be tolerated in our game.\\" Wigan Warriors Before the scandal that led to Fletcher being stripped of his captaincy, banned for 1 game and fined A$10,000 he had agreed to a move to England to play for Super League club; Wigan Warriors after three years at Souths. Fletcher joined the Wigan club in 2006 in time for the pre season training but was sidelined for the opening four rounds of Super League after needing emergency Bowel Surgery in early January. Fletcher's d√©but came against Warrington Wolves on 10 March 2006 at the JJB Stadium in Wigan, and made an instant impact as a substitute scoring his first try three minutes into his first appearance. He was one of the stalwarts that helped Wigan through one of the most tumultuous times in the club's history on and off the field in 2006 with the dismissal of coach Ian Millward, the low morale within the team and seeing the once feared Wigan club sitting at the bottom of the table. Thanks to Fletcher's impact in the and the positions Wigan managed the seemingly impossible and survived relegation from the Super League, finishing 7th and just missing a playoff place to local rivals Warrington. Playing statistics At the end of the 2007 Super League season, Bryan Fletcher retired from competitive rugby league. He had played in 125 games for the Sydney Roosters, 45 for Souths, and a further 55 for Wigan. He also played 2 games for City Origin, 14 State of Origin games for NSW and 13 Test and World Cup matches for Australia. Personal life He got married in 2003, to Britt Fletcher. Together they had 3 daughters, Scarlett, Maya, and Lucca. When he retired from playing in 2007, Fletcher and his business partner Craig Markham began a cleaning company called Cleanfit. The company cleans a number of pubs, clubs and office blocks in Sydney. It also allows Fletcher, who is a qualified plumber, to utilise his trade in order to help with the business. In 2013, Bryan Fletcher was a regular presenter on Channel 9's weekly football season program \\"The Footy Show\\". Fletcher presented the \\"Kick for Cash\\" segment. In 2014, Bryan Fletcher joined Fox Sports \\"Monday Night with Matty Johns' forming a duo with fellow former NRL player Nathan Hindmarsh. Fletcher and Hindmarsh participate in many challenges set by the producers.

The Uber driver reportedly filmed Fletcher in a snapchat video saying \\"Look who I'm selling bags to ‚Ä¶\\". Fletcher responded with \\"Don't say that, I don't know who this driver is, we're just hanging out it's Saturday night, I'm just in an Uber\\". Fletcher's manager Steve Gillis told the media \\"The driver asked him for a quick Snapchat video he's been set up. \\"Fletcher told me that he's never met the bloke, he just jumped in the back of his cab and driver pulled this stunt he's clearly been set up\\".https://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/footy-star-bryan-fletcher-says- snapchat-drug-video/3480824/ In 2019, Bryan was chosen to be part of the core host ensemble for the Unibet Australia weekly television format program \\"At Odds\\".

Location The station is located on Ormskirk Road, with the southbound platform accessible from Ormskirk Road and the northbound platform under the railway bridge on Copy Lane (which is actually in Netherton). Interchange with local bus services is available on both Ormskirk Road, Copy Lane and from the station's new bus terminus. Old Roan is a more convenient station for much of Aintree Village compared with Aintree. History The station was opened on 17 February 1936 by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. The line was originally part of the Liverpool, Ormskirk and Preston Railway, until the railway was later absorbed by the Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway. Services ran from Ormskirk to Liverpool Exchange - the latter station closed in 1977 & now services run underground to Moorfields & continue on to Liverpool Central. Housing development on what had previously been farmland encouraged the London Midland And Scottish Railway, successor to the Lancashire and Yorkshire, to build a station at Old Roan in 1935, it being named after an adjacent public house. Although the lines on which Old Roan is situated ran parallel to those of the Cheshire Lines Committee's North Liverpool Extension Line, (running from Liverpool Central High Level to Southport Lord Street), there were no platforms on the CLC line, although a junction between the two routes did exist south of the station. Facilities The station is staffed, 15 minutes before the first train and 15 minutes after the last train. There is a booking office, payphone, toilet and live departure and arrival screens for passenger information. The station has a secure storage for 20 cycles. The station is fully accessible for wheelchair users with lift access to the platforms and step free access to the car park and booking office. Services Old Roan is served by electric trains between Liverpool Central and Ormskirk. There are trains every 15 minutes during Monday to Saturday daytime, and every 30 minutes during the evening and on Sundays.

The can was unearthed in an old lady's cellar. Michel Moine (8 March 1920 in Airvault - 15 January 2005 in Buxerolles) was a French journalist and parapsychologist. He was the director of the news division of RTL from 1958 to 1967, and then of RMC from 1967 to 1982. He was also well known for his books on radiesthesia, and the series of TV documentaries La cam√©ra de l'√©trange, created with his friend and fellow journalist Jean-Louis Degaudenzi. The early years Michel Moine was born on 8 March 1920 in Airvault (France). After a schooling at the Jesuit coll√®ge of Le Mans (he tells some stories from that period in the Guide of radiesthesia), then at lyc√©e in Poitiers, he obtains his baccalaur√©at (French equivalent of A levels or High School graduation) and moves to Paris. There he obtains a diploma from the √âcole du Louvre, and another diploma from the Sorbonne. The parapsychologist and the journalist : two careers in parallel Hypnosis correspondence course found in his grandparents' attic. According to biographical elements in the Guide of radiesthesia, his career as occultist began the day before his first communion, when he found a 1902 brochure from a New York City correspondence course in hypnosis in his grandparents' attic. Following the instructions in the course, he succeeds in his attempt to put to sleep Fernand, the fifteen- year-old gardener helper of the family, but then he could not wake him up. At first he considered writing to the New York Institute of Science for help, but the answer would have taken way too long. So he skimmed feverishly through the rest of the course in the hope to find and answer, and it was finally lesson XVII, \\"How to wake up hypnotised subjects\\" that saved young Fernand from sleep therapy. He voluntarily enlisted in the French army in 1939 (at the age of 19) and was taken prisoner, but finally managed to escape after several attempts. During one of his attempts he was shot in the leg. At the end of World War II, he became a member of the special services of the provisional government. He was decorated with the Ordre National du M√©rite, the M√©daille des √âvad√©s, and the Croix du combattant volontaire 1939-1945. He also became secretary for writer and Goncourt academician Jean Ajalbert, and began his career as a journalist by reporting for the daily newspaper La Presse. In 1948, he founded a small publishing house called Les √âditions de l'Ermite, and published La Th√©osophie au XX si√®cle, by Marcel Bohrer, as well as his two first books on radiesthesia. This same year his son Jean-Louis was born. In 1954, he founded the periodical Radiesth√©sie Magazine. In 1958, he became director of information for RTL Radio, and had to set aside his occult interests for the sake of his reputation. He ceased involvement with Radiesth√©sie Magazine, which continued without him until the mid-1970s. On 5 July 1959, after the failure of his first marriage, he met the journalist Fran√ßoise Eschmann, daughter of Paul Eschmann, architect from the city of Nancy. In 1967, he left RTL for RMC where he did the same thing as director of information until 1982. In 1973, he published his Guide de la Radiesth√©sie, now considered a classic. In the early 1980s, he directed a series of documentaries on parapsychology, in collaboration with his fellow journalist and friend Jean-Louis Degaudenzi: La cam√©ra de l'√©trange, for RTL Television. In 1987, he founded a small radio station, Radio Val d'Or (R.V.O.), in his birthplace of Airvault. En 1990, he was appointed by the CSA as Conseiller du comit√© technique radiophonique de la r√©gion Centre. Michel Moine died on 15 January 2005 in Buxerolles.

Harrison's elevation to the Souths captaincy in 2005 proved to be a turning point in both the club's 2005 season and his career, as the team won six of their final eight matches under his captaincy to avoid the wooden spoon (the only losses in that period were against the eventual Grand Finalists, Wests Tigers and North Queensland). =Sydney Roosters= Harrison moved to South Sydney's arch rivals the Sydney Roosters for the 2006 NRL season. He managed 41 out of a possible 48 matches at the Roosters. Harrison playing for the Gold Coast Titans in 2008 =Gold Coast Titans= Harrison returned to Queensland to play for the Gold Coast Titans from 2008. At the Titans, he started at lock and performed well covering five- eighth also while Matthew Rogers was out on suspension. As a result, he was named 18th man for the 2008 State of Origin series for Queensland. He started in both the second and third State of Origin games. Harrison was picked ahead of his club captain Scott Prince (who was only drafted into the squad after a knee injury sustained by Darren Lockyer) to play in the second State of Origin on 11 June 2008. In April 2009, he was named in the preliminary 25-man squad to represent Queensland in the opening State of Origin match for 2009. In the 2009 NRL season, Harrison was part of the first Gold Coast team to reach the finals. Harrison played in both finals matches against the Brisbane Broncos and Parramatta. The following year, Harrison was a member of the Gold Coast side which enjoyed their best season on the field as they eventually reached the preliminary final before being defeated by Harrison's old club the Sydney Roosters. In the 2011 NRL season, Harrison was limited to only 13 games as the Gold Coast finished last on the table and claimed the wooden spoon. Harrison was only selected for Game I of the 2013 State of Origin series in which Queensland extended their record for consecutive series victories to eight. On 27 June 2014, he confirmed his retirement earlier than he wanted due to a neck injury.http://www.triplem.com.au/sydney/sport/nrl/news/2014/4/ashley-harrison- of-gold-coast-titans-announces-retirement/ Footnotes External links  *NRL profile Category:1981 births Category:Australian rugby league players Category:Gold Coast Titans players Category:Sydney Roosters players Category:South Sydney Rabbitohs players Category:South Sydney Rabbitohs captains Category:Brisbane Broncos players Category:Queensland Rugby League State of Origin players Category:NRL All Stars players Category:Prime Minister's XIII players Category:Rugby league locks Category:Rugby league five-eighths Category:Sportsmen from Queensland Category:Living people Category:Rugby league players from Brisbane ","title":"Ashley Harrison"},{"id":"2730649","text":"Hillsborough is a village in Albert County in the Canadian province of New Brunswick. The village is situated on a hill overlooking the Petitcodiac River near the intersection of Route 910 and Route 114. Hillsborough is the largest settlement in Hillsborough Parish. History Originally established around 1700 as \\"Blanchard's Village\\" by Acadian farmers, they lived here for sixty years, building dykes that are still in use. Before the Great Expulsion of the Acadians in 1755, the area was almost 100% French. Now, few Acadians live there, though there are several Acadian settlements on the opposite bank of the Petitcodiac River, such as Pre d'en Haut, New Brunswick. On September 4, 1755, the Battle of Petitcodiac was fought near Hillsborough. After the capture of Fort Beausejour during the Seven Years' War, in an attempt to gain control over the region, the British sent a punitive expedition consisting of two companies of British colonial troops into the Petitcodiac River Valley to destroy the Acadian settlements located there. While the main body finished their operation on the eastern bank, a detachment was dispatched to the western bank. When the detachment under Major Joseph Frye approached Blanchard's Village, located near where Hillsborough now stands, it encountered French forces under the command of Captain Charles Deschamps de Boish√©bert and was driven off with heavy losses. The site is marked by a National Historic Sites and Monument plaque. In 1766, a group of settlers arrived in the area led by Matthias Somers, Michael Lutz, Jacob Trietz (Trites), Charles Jones, and Heinrich Stieff (Steeves).Online book excerpt Heinrich Steeves had seven sons and the name Steeves is still common among residents.

A Liberal, she was appointed to the Senate 28 July 1955 on the recommendation of Louis St-Laurent, and represented the senatorial division of Murray Harbour, Prince Edward Island until her death. She was the first female Senator from Prince Edward Island.  Early life  left Florence Elise Inman was born in West River, Prince Edward Island in Queen's County to Alexander Macdonald and his wife, Florence (n√©e White). At an early age, she lived with her grandfather on his farm and later moved to the city of Charlottetown. In the later years, Inman owned an inn known as the Poole House Inn in Montague located in the eastern end of the island, populated at 1,200 people. She was also the Vice President of the Inn's Association, the only women to hold that position at the time. Inman was married at eighteen to Charlottetown lawyer George Strong Inman. He had many political aspirations that inspired her to follow in his direction of politics and she was a great aid to him in his campaigns. The two were married from 1910 and had four sons and eight grandchildren. Her four sons consisted of: Commander William Robert (W.R.) Inman located in Ottawa; Dr. George Strong Inman who practices medicine at Montague and on occasion, his children would help his mother at the Poole House Inn; Lt. Commander Wilfred Nelson (W.N.) Inman stationed at St. John's, Newfoundland; and Major Roland Victor (R.V.) Inman, who is on the joint staff in Washington. Elise was also interested Imperial Order Daughters of the Empire (IODE) and wanted to offer her aid in the Red Cross Movement. She is responsible for the Blood Donor Clinic set up in Summerside.  Politics  Inman was very inspired by her husband's political achievements. She was an advocate for women's rights to vote and urged women across Prince Edward Island to do so. She also went before the Island Government, accompanied by Mrs. Cecil Stewart, to ask that all women be given the opportunity to vote. After her husband's death in 1937, she remained active in her political work. When the Canada Act 1982 was before the Senate, Inman was among 23 members of the upper house to oppose the patriation of the Constitution of Canada.

Such a product chain exists out of an extraction phase, a production phase, a use phase and a waste phase. The ultimate goal of ICM is a reduction of environmental load over the whole chain. Integrated Chain Management is one of the approaches that can be used to come to sustainable development. Other approaches in this line are the Ecological Footprint and the DTO approach. Within the ICM approach all phases within the chain must be considered. Therefore, it can be seen as a \\"cradle to grave\\" approach. Several inputs and outputs can be taken into account when applying the ICM approach. Such as: Energy flows, mass flows, materials, waste flows and emissions. Within ICM material cycles should be closed where possible and the remainder flows of emissions and waste should be brought within acceptable boundaries. Also the use of resources should be kept to a minimum. Integrated chain management should not be mixed up with Supply Chain Management or Integrated Supply Chain Management. These concepts do not have the reduction of environmental load as their main goal. An important aspect of ICM is that shifting to other phases in the product chain is avoided. For instance, a producer of chairs can choose to leave off an environment unfriendly material in a new product. The producer can even see this as an extra selling point for the customer, but as a consequence the supplier of raw materials has to use much more energy to produce a material with the same qualities. The result of this is that there may no longer be a net environmental reduction across the whole chain. Within the integrated chain management approach this is avoided. The chain can be managed by developing new policies and economical or political incentives. Therefore, one must have insight into the inputs and outputs of the production chain. Before these policies can be developed one must engage in several actions. *Analyse the processes into a preferred level of detail *Determine the boundaries of the chain. Should links outside the companies be involved as well? *Determine whether there should be a focus on just one or on several environmental problems *Determine on which material flows or energy flows there should be a focus. Effective supply chain management can impact virtually all business and production processes Example An example of applying the ICM approach would be to develop policies in a particular product area. The responsibility of problems caused by the waste stage can be assigned to the producers of these products. This leads to improved product design and new insight in how to put these products in the market. For instance the product can be sold with a disposal contribution. On the price tag of a radio nowadays can be printed: \\"this radio costs 25 $ not including the 3 $ disposal contribution\\" The effects can be seen within the whole chain. The producer will try to choose non-polluting materials, as they increase the costs of the waste-stage. The producer of raw materials will try to improve its production process in order to meet the increased demand for 'clean' primary products. And the consumer will be aware that some products give more pressure on the environment than others when its economical lifespan has run out.

He is often referred to as the \\"Father of Irish Botany\\". He was the father of naturalist, artist and entomologist Robert Templeton. Biography Templeton was born at Orange Grove, Belfast in 1766 (some 68 years after it was so named from William of Orange having tethered his horse to a Spanish Chestnut tree beside the house on his way south from Carrickfergus to face the armies of James II at the River Boyne). He married Katherine Johnson of Seymour Hill, on the outskirts of Belfast, the daughter of a Belfast merchant on 21 December 1799. The couple had five children: Ellen, born on 30 September 1800, Robert, born on 12 December 1802, Catherine, born on 19 July 1806, Mary, born on 9 December 1809 and Matilda on 2 November 1813. The union between the two already prosperous merchant families provided more than ample means enabling Templeton to devote himself passionately to the study of natural history. Influenced by the French Revolution, which many saw as lighting a beacon of enlightenment before the counter-revolutionary Civil War and the ensuing \\"Terror\\", Templeton was an early member of the United Irishmen. At once a fervent advocate of Irish independence from the United Kingdom he changed the name of the family home to 'Cranmore' (Irish: crann m√≥r; 'big tree'). Disillusionment came with the murders of a number of Protestants at Wexford bridge and the rise of sectarian Irish nationalism, though he remained a strenuous and enlightened advocate of civil and religious liberty. Never of strong constitution, he was not expected to survive,Deane, C.D. 1983. The Ulster Countryside. Century Books. he was in failing health from 1815 and died in 1825 aged only 60, \\"leaving a sorrowing wife, youthful family and many friends and townsmen who greatly mourned his death\\". The Australian leguminous genus Templetonia is named for him. His son Robert became a famous entomologist. Botany Plants in the tropical house in the Botanic Gardens, Belfast John Templeton's interest in botany began with an experimental garden laid out according to a suggestion in Rousseau's 'Nouvelle Heloise' and following Rousseau's 'Letters on the Elements of Botany'. Here he cultivated many tender exotics out of doors and began botanical studies which lasted throughout his life and corresponded with the most eminent botanists in England Sir William Hooker, William Turner, James Sowerby and, especially Sir Joseph Banks, who had travelled on Captain James Cook's voyages, and in charge of Kew Gardens. Banks tried (unsuccessfully) to tempt him to New Holland (Australia) as a botanist on the Flinders's Expedition with the offer of a large tract of land and a substantial salary. An associate of the Linnean Society, Templeton visited London and saw the botanical work being achieved there. This led to his promotion of the Belfast Botanic Gardens as early as 1809, and to work on a Catalogue of Native Irish Plants, in manuscript form and now in the Royal Irish Academy, which was used as an accurate foundation for later work by succeeding Irish botanists. He also assembled text and executed many beautiful watercolour drawings for a Flora Hibernica, sadly never finished, and kept a detailed Journal during the years 1806‚Äì1825 (both now in the Ulster Museum, Belfast). Of the 12000 algal specimens in the Ulster Museum Herbarium about 148 are in the Templeton collection and were mostly collected by him, some were collected by others and passed to Templeton. The specimens in the Templeton collection in the Ulster Museum (BEL) have been catalogued.

Templeton was the first finder of Rosa hibernica (1795) and in Ireland of Sisymbrium Ligusticum seoticum (1793), Adoxa moschatellina (1820), Orobanche rubra and many other plants. Natural History of Ireland Naturalist's Report in Belfast Monthly Magazine 1811 John Templeton had wide-ranging scientific interests including chemistry as it applied to agriculture and horticulture, meteorology and phenology following Robert Marsham. He published very little aside from monthly reports on natural history and meteorology in the 'Belfast Magazine' commenced in 1808. John Templeton studied birds extensively, collected shells, marine organisms (especially zoophytes and insects, notably garden pest species. He planned an 'Hibernian Fauna' to accompany 'Hibernian Flora'.

He was brother of Jatayu. He has the form of a vulture. According to Brahma Puran, Sampati is said to have a son named Babhru, who was swift and very well known. Sampati lost his wings when he was a child.  Sampati loses his wings  Sampathi and Jatayu, when young, used to compete as to who could fly higher in nilmatha. On one such instance Jatayu flew so high that he was about to get seared by the sun's flames. Sampati saved his brother by spreading his own wings and thus shielding Jatayu from the hot flames. In the process, Sampati himself got injured and lost his wings. As a result, Sampati lived wingless for the rest of his life.  Sampati in Ramayana  Sampati proved instrumental in Sita's search later on in the Ramayana. His role comes when the search party sent to the south, led by Hanuman with Angada, Jambavan, Nala and Nila exhausted, thirsty and depressed, reach the southern end of the land. They have the endless sea before them, and still no clue of Sita. Disappointed, everybody collapses on the sand, unable and unwilling to move or act any further. At this point, Sampati appears, openly talking about his fortune in so much easy meat arriving at his doorstep. At that moment, Jambavan laments out loud, comparing the morals of a vulture who would prey on the helpless with the vulture Jatayu, who defended Sita from Ravana. The vulture froze as soon as he heard the word \\"Jatayu\\", and he asked to be told the story. After hearing of Jatayu's fate, a weeping Sampati reveals that he is Jatayu's brother, and that he hadn't contacted his brother in a long time. In gratitude for sharing the story, Sampati tells the party that Sita had been taken south to Sri Lanka. The Griddhraj Parvat, situated in Satna district in Madhya Pradesh, is believed to be the birthplace of Sampati.Skanda Purana References Category:Characters in the Ramayana Category:Legendary birds ","title":"Sampati"},{"id":"2730682","text":"Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune pruritic skin disease preferentially in older people, aged over 60, that may involve the formation of blisters (bullae) in the space between the epidermal and dermal skin layers. The disorder is a type of pemphigoid. It is classified as a type II hypersensitivity reaction, with the formation of anti-hemidesmosome antibodies. Signs and symptoms Clinically, the earliest lesions may appear as a hives-like red raised rash, but could also appear dermatitic, targetoid, lichenoid, nodular, or even without a rash (essential pruritus). Tense bullae eventually erupt, most commonly at the inner thighs and upper arms, but the trunk and extremities are frequently both involved. Any part of the skin surface can be involved. Oral lesions are present in a minority of cases. The disease may be acute, but can last from months to years with periods of exacerbation and remission. Several other skin diseases may have similar symptoms. However, milia are more common with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, because of the deeper antigenic targets. A more ring-like configuration with a central depression or centrally collapsed bullae may indicate linear IgA disease. Nikolsky's sign is negative, unlike pemphigus vulgaris, where it is positive.  Causes  In most cases of bullous pemphigoid, no clear precipitating factors are identified. Potential precipitating events that have been reported include exposure to ultraviolet light and radiation therapy. Onset of pemphigoid has also been associated with certain drugs, including furosemide, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, DPP-4 inhibitors, captopril, penicillamine, and antibiotics. Pathophysiology The bullae are formed by an immune reaction, initiated by the formation of IgG autoantibodies targeting dystonin, also called bullous pemphigoid antigen 1, and/or type XVII collagen, also called bullous pemphigoid antigen 2, which is a component of hemidesmosomes. A different form of dystonin is associated with neuropathy. Following antibody targeting, a cascade of immunomodulators results in a variable surge of immune cells, including neutrophils, lymphocytes and eosinophils coming to the affected area. Unclear events subsequently result in a separation along the dermoepidermal junction and eventually stretch bullae. Diagnosis Micrograph of bullous pemphigoid. Subepidermal blistering [solid arrows in (A,B)] and influx of inflammatory cells including eosinophils and neutrophils in thedermis [solid arrow (C)] and blister cavity [dashed arrows (C)]. In (C) also deposition of fibrin is noted (asterisks). Diagnosis consist of at least 2 positive results out of 3 criteria (2-out-of-3 rule): (1) pruritus and/or predominant cutaneous blisters, (2) linear IgG and/or C3c deposits (in an n- serrated pattern) by direct immunofluorescence microscopy (DIF) on a skin biopsy specimen, and (3) positive epidermal side staining by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy on human salt-split skin (IIF SSS) on a serum sample. Routine H&E; staining or ELISA tests do not add value to initial diagnosis. Treatment Treatments include topical steroids such as clobetasol, and halobetasol which in some studies have proven to be equally effective as systemic, or pill, therapy and somewhat safer. However, in difficult-to-manage or widespread cases, systemic prednisone and powerful steroid-free immunosuppressant medications, such as methotrexate, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil, may be appropriate. Some of these medications have the potential for severe adverse effects such as kidney and liver damage, increased susceptibility to infections, and bone marrow suppression. Antibiotics such as tetracycline or erythromycin may also control the disease, particularly in patients who cannot use corticosteroids. The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab has been found to be effective in treating some otherwise refractory cases of pemphigoid. A 2010 meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials showed that oral steroids and potent topical steroids are effective treatments, although their use may be limited by side- effects, while lower doses of topical steroids are safe and effective for treatment of moderate bullous pemphigoid. IgA-mediated pemphigoid can often be difficult to treat even with usually effective medications such as rituximab. Prognosis Bullous pemphigoid may be self-resolving in a period ranging from several months to many years even without treatment. Poor general health related to old age is associated with a poorer prognosis. Epidemiology Very rarely seen in children, bullous and non-bullous pemphigoid most commonly occurs in people 70 years of age and older. Its estimated frequency is seven to 14 cases per million per year, but has been reported to be as high as 472 cases per million per year in Scottish men older than 85. At least one study indicates the incidence might be increasing in the United Kingdom. Some sources report it affects men twice as frequently as women, while others report no difference between the sexes. Many mammals can be afflicted, including dogs, cats, pigs, and horses, as well as humans. It is very rare in dogs; on average, three cases are diagnosed around the world each year. Research Animal models of bullous pemphigoid have been developed using transgenic techniques to produce mice lacking the genes for the two known autoantigens, dystonin and collagen XVII.

A New South Wales State of Origin and Australian international representative and , he could also play and spent the majority of his career at the Newcastle Knights, with whom he won the 1997 and 2001 Premierships. He has also played for the Sydney Roosters and South Sydney Rabbitohs. His brothers, Luke MacDougall, Ben MacDougall and Scott MacDougall have also played in the NRL. His father, Gil MacDougall, played for the Balmain Tigers and Western Suburbs Magpies NSWRFL.List of family relations in rugby league#MacDougall brothers In retirement, MacDougall founded a nutrition company that produces the popular meal replacement product, The MAN Shake. Background MacDougall was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Sydney Roosters MacDougall made his first-grade debut for the Sydney City Roosters in the 1995 ARL season. Newcastle Knights MacDougall is third on the club's all time try scorers list and sixth on the club's all time point- scorers list. In MacDougall's first season with Newcastle he scored five tries in eleven games that culminated in the club's victory in the 1997 ARL Grand Final where he famously, but accidentally stood on the head of Manly-Warringah captain Geoff Toovey after being tackled by the Manly halfback. In 1998, MacDougall made his representative debut for New South Wales rugby league team after a stellar start to the season. On 8 July 1998, MacDougall tested positive to stimulants ephedrine and amfepramone. MacDougall's A and B samples both also recorded an epitestosterone to testosterone level greater than the allowable 6:1 ratio ‚Äì indicating the possible use of steroids. On 28 August he pleaded guilty to using one banned stimulant and was found to have inadvertently used another and received an 11-match ban along with teammates Robbie O'Davis and Wayne Richards who each received 22-week bans. It was revealed during his appeal that MacDougall had suffered a severe head injury in 1993 that damaged his pituitary gland and it was essential that he take prescribed medication, called Sustanon 250, which included a banned steroid. This medication restored normal hormone levels in his body and without it, he would suffer potentially serious side effects and not be able to lead a normal life, let alone play football.The Herald Performance drug use report shocks After just two games back for the Knights in 1999, MacDougall was recalled to the New South Wales rugby league team. Arguably MacDougall's best seasons came in 2000 and 2001, where he scored 30 tries in 41 games and starred in NSW comprehensive 3‚Äì0 series win against Queensland in 2000. He also played in Australia's victory in the 2000 World Cup Final. In round 20 2001, MacDougall equalled Darren Albert's club record of four tries in a match during Newcastle's 37‚Äì30 victory over the New Zealand Warriors at Ericsson Stadium. MacDougall won a second premiership with the Knights, playing on the wing in their 2001 NRL Grand Final victory over the Parramatta Eels. After that he went on the 2001 Kangaroo tour. South Sydney Rabbitohs MacDougall switched to the South Sydney Rabbitohs for the 2004 NRL season. Return to the Knights MacDougall re-commenced playing for the Knights in the 2007 NRL season. He had already enjoyed a long and successful career with the Knights, having played with them from 1996 to 2003. In Round 26 of the 2011 NRL season, MacDougall was farewelled in his last home game for the Knights. He played his last game the following week against the Melbourne Storm at AAMI Park in the first week of the finals series.  Career highlights  *Junior Club: Harbord Diggers, De La Salle-Caringbah *Career Stats: 195 career games with 92 tries  Representative games  *State of Origin: Played 11 games in total for New South Wales *International: Played 11 tests for Australia including the 2000 World Cup  The MAN Shake  In retirement, MacDougall, who has master's degrees in Business Administration and Business Coaching as well as a Bachelor of Economics, started a nutrition company called Cranky Health. Its flagship product is The MAN Shake, a meal replacement made specifically for men. The company also produces protein bars and meal replacement shakes for women called The Lady Shake. In 2015, MacDougall released his first book with publisher Penguin Books called The Man Plan. The books promotes a healthy lifestyle for men, focusing on simple 10-minute workouts and easy to follow recipes. He also launched The Man Challenge, an online health and fitness program specifically created for the needs of men. The Man Challenge is built on the premise of exercising for just 10 minutes a day and giving men a simple to follow meal plan that still allows them to enjoy a beer and a burger. Also involved is AFL Premiership winning Coach Paul Roos who acts as a motivator for users of the program, while another feature includes taking on celebrity athletes such as Sonny Bill Williams to exercise challenges.

They gave their name to the province of Leinster, which in the medieval era was known in Irish as C√≥iced Laigen, meaning \\"province of the Leinstermen\\" (Modern Irish C√∫ige Laighean). Their territory, located in south- east Ireland, is thought to have once extended from the River Shannon to the River Boyne. Etymology Laigin is a plural noun, indicating an ethnonym rather than a geographic term, but the Irish system of naming territories meant that an area tended to be named after an apical ancestor-figure even when the ruling dynasty had no links to that figure. The origin of their name is uncertain; however, it is traditionally assumed to derive from the Irish word ', meaning 'a spear'. Early texts use names Laigen and Gaileoin interchangeably.John T. Koch, Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia. Vols 1-4, p. 1079. Origins The Laigin are claimed as being descended from Labraid Loingsech. Modern historians suggest, on the basis of Irish traditions and related place names, that the Laigin were a group of invaders from Gaul or Britain, who arrived no later than the 6th century BC, and were later incorporated into the medieval genealogical scheme which made all the ruling groups of early Ireland descend from M√≠l Esp√°ine. Placenames also suggest they once had a presence in north Munster and in Connacht.Byrne 2001, pp. 130-164 Related peoples and dynasties Archaic poems found in medieval genealogical texts distinguish three groups making up the Laigin: the Laigin proper, the Gaile√≥in, and the Fir Domnann. The latter are suggested to be related to the British Dumnonii.D√°ibh√≠ √ì Cr√≥in√≠n, \\"Ireland, 400-800\\", in D√°ibh√≠ √ì Cr√≥in√≠n (ed.), A New History of Ireland Vol 1, 2005, pp. 182-234 Amongst others, some of the dynasties that claimed to belong to the Laigin include: U√≠ Failge, U√≠ Biarrche, U√≠ D√∫nlainge, U√≠ Ceinnselaig, U√≠ Garrchon, and the U√≠ M√°il. In medieval literature In the legendary tales of the Ulster Cycle, the king of the Connachta, Ailill mac M√°ta, is said to belong to the Laigin. This is thought by Byrne (2001) to be related to a possible early domination of the province of Connacht by peoples related to the Laigin, the Fir Domnann and the Gamanrad.

He wrote the daily bridge column for The New York Times for 41 years, from 1964 to 2005, and served as Executive Editor for the first six editions of The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge from 1964 to 2002. Alan and Dorothy Truscott (1998)  Britain  Truscott was born in Brixton, south London, and showed early prowess at chess. He attended Whitgift School in Croydon and served in the Royal Navy for three years around the end of World War II. From 1947 he studied at the University of Oxford, which he represented at both chess and bridge. With Oxford partner Robert d'Unienville, he was on the British team (along with Terence Reese and Boris Schapiro) that won a bronze medal at the 1951 European Bridge League championships, age only 26. He represented Britain in the same event twice more, finishing second with partner Maurice Harrison-Gray in 1958 (again along with Reese‚ÄìSchapiro) and first with partner Tony Priday in 1961. He was in charge of organising the 1961 rendition hosted by Torquay in Devonshire, England. As European champions that British team finished third in the 1962 Bermuda Bowl held in New York City. The 1961 European Teams was his only international championship outside the British Isles.  America  According to Maureen Hiron, bridge columnist for The Independent of London, in New York City \\"he fell in love with one of the scorers, in particular, and America in general, and decided to cross the Atlantic.\\" Richard L. Frey, the American Contract Bridge League publications director, recruited Truscott to help edit the ACBL's membership magazine and its Official Encyclopedia of Bridge, whose first edition was underway. Truscott moved to New York City, then the ACBL headquarters, and succeeded Albert Morehead as bridge editor of The New York Times 1 January 1964. Truscott wrote a bridge column for the New York Times daily until March 1994, and then three times a week until April 2005, when he retired due to poor health, for a total of some 12,750 columns. Frey, Truscott, and the editorial board led by Morehead completed the first edition of The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge in 1964. Truscott would be the executive editor of the encyclopedia until his death. Alan Truscott had three children, Frances, Fraser and Philip, with his first wife, Gloria Gilling. That marriage was dissolved 1971Hiron and in 1972 he married the American bridge expert and internationalist Dorothy Hayden, born Johnson, a former math teacher and actuary, who had four children from two previous marriages.Alder Alan Truscott wrote thirteen bridge books, including two with his wife, Dorothy, and one with Phillip Alder. He died of cancer at their vacation home in New Russia, New York, near Lake Champlain. His widow died the following year. Buenos Aires affair As New York Times correspondent, Truscott covered the 1965 contract bridge world championship Bermuda Bowl in Buenos Aires and became a chief witness in a cheating scandal where Terence Reese and Boris Schapiro, representing Europe, were accused of using their fingers to pass information about their cards. The initial accusers were the American partnership of B. Jay Becker and Dorothy Hayden; the two confided their suspicions to Truscott, a close friend of Hayden's (and later her husband), and to John Gerber, then captain of the USA team. After an investigation, Reese and Schapiro were judged guilty by the World Bridge Federation authorities at the tournament in Buenos Aires. The British Bridge League (BBL) convened its own inquiry, and next year judged them not guilty by the \\"reasonable doubt\\" standard.

Chevert was born in Verdun, Meuse. He entered service in 1706, became major in Beauce's regiment in Toul in 1728, later in 1739 lieutenant-colonel. He distinguished himself in Flanders, Piemont and Germany and was rewarded by a more important command, as lieutenant-colonel of a grenadier regiment. As part of the French force, he led the siege of Prague in the War of the Austrian Succession with his grenadiers in 1741 and helped defend the city against the Austrian troops. Named brigadier, he took part in the operations in the Dauphin√© and Italy, most famously Casteldelfino, and became mar√©chal-de-camp in 1744. During the campaign in the Provence, he seized the isles of Sainte- Marguerite, after which coup he was named lieutenant-general in 1748. With this title, he commanded the French flanking force at the victory of Hastenbeck. In the following year he also commanded the flanking force in the French victory at Lutterburg. During this illustrious career in the course of which he passed through all important ranks of the hierarchy, Chevert seems to have known nothing but success, save for one small defeat at the battle of Meer (or Mehr) in 1758, where a large component of his corps consisted of green troops and militia. A simple major of a regiment, he was awarded the order of Chevalier de Saint-Louis in 1742, became commander in 1754, was decorated with the Grand Croix in 1758 and made knight of the Aigle Blanc de Pologne in the same year.

The nature of this role, and the actual performance of those who fill it, are subjects of some controversy within Subud. Most Subud groups have helpers, who are responsible for assisting other members in various ways, as well as simply timing the latihan. Helpers exist at the local, regional, national, and international levels within the Subud organization. Ideally, a helper should have at least seven years of practicing the latihan and be generally 'loved and respected' by their fellow members. One becomes a helper by asking the helpers to \\"test\\", or receive, whether the person has the capacity to fulfill the helper job at that point in time. That is, the helpers make a decision based on what they receive in their testing, and with as little mental thought and personal opinion as is humanly possible. A focus of criticism is the role some helpers adopt as spiritual and personal counselors. Their ability and understanding apparently vary considerably. Reviewing the internet one can see a whole variety of balanced and not so balanced opinions of helpers. Helpers are as imperfect as the next person, and as is natural in any position of 'authority' interpersonal clashes involving helpers and other helpers and helpers and members do occur. There is no official training program nor set of predetermined skills necessary to become a Helper. Thus most Helpers, unless they have obtained training and licensure outside of the Subud organization in psychology, or behavioral health, or psychiatry, or other related career field, are thus untrained and unskilled. According to the Subud USA National By-Laws (posted at www.subudusa.org), helpers serve six main functions. Note that these are the functions mentioned in the By-Laws, and that other functions are specified in other places, such as Bapak's \\"Advice and Guidance for Helpers\\" (see link below)): #Verify that members are active in the national (not-for-profit) organization, thereby giving membership status (Article 3, Section 1); #Removing membership status (Article 3, Section 2); #Reinstating membership status (Article 3, Section 3); #Supervising the national census (Article 5, Section 2); #Serving as members in standing national committees (Article 6, Section 6); and #Consulting with the National Board of Directors in certain situations regarding filling vacancies of the Officers of the Corporation (Article 7, Section 3). Relationships between the Helpers (but not the duties and responsibilities of the Helpers) are dealt with in Article 11 of the By-Laws. Officially, helpers are there to help Bapak, the founder of Subud, by supporting the Subud association in his absence. They have the responsibility to explain what Subud is to any interested person, to facilitate a person's first receiving (opening), and to serve members in deepening their receiving and applying it in their lives.Bapak has said frequently that being a helper is absolutely not a sign of spiritual superiority and that it is possible that some non-helpers are spiritually superior to the helpers. Similarly, there is no spiritual hierarchy of helpers: international helpers, national helpers and local helpers are simply designated as such for practical purposes.

He was a member of the Afro Celt Sound System and is a member of the Irish-American supergroup The Gloaming. He has recorded several solo albums for Real World Records. He appeared in the 2015 film Brooklyn singing an a cappella version of the Irish song \\"Casadh an tSugain\\". Early life √ì Lion√°ird was born and raised in C√∫il Aodha in the West Cork Gaeltacht, a primarily Irish-speaking region. His father was a teacher and his mother and grandmother were singers in the traditional sean-n√≥s style. Elizabeth Cronin, whose singing was recorded by Alan Lomax, was √ì Lion√°ird's great-aunt. √ì Lion√°ird was one of twelve children in his family. √ì Lion√°ird first sang publicly at the age of five, and made his first radio broadcast at seven. At the age of twelve he recorded the traditional song \\"Aisling Gheal\\" for Gael Linn Records. He joined Se√°n √ì Riada's male voice choir C√≥r Ch√∫il Aodha as a child and sang in the choir, directed after Sean √ì Riada's death by his son Peadar, until he was in his early twenties. √ì Lion√°ird earned a Bachelor of Education degree at Carysfort College in Dublin and was employed as a primary school teacher for seven years before making a career as a singer. Musical career √ì Lion√°ird collaborated with Tony MacMahon and Noel Hill on Aisling√≠ Ceoil ‚Äì Music of Dreams, a live album of traditional Irish music recorded in Dublin in 1993 and released in 1994 by Gael Linn. √ì Lion√°ird performed three songs in sean-n√≥s style with piano accompaniment. Seeking a way to combine his role as a \\"culture-bearing\\" traditional singer with musical creativity in order to \\"make new music\\", √ì Lion√°ird was drawn to ambient music for its \\"capacity to accept ornate styles of music as part of its matrix\\". He has said that hearing Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan singing on Peter Gabriel's album Passion was a \\"light bulb moment\\" which made him think that sean-n√≥s could also \\"inhabit this ambient soundscape\\". √ì Lion√°ird wrote to Peter Gabriel asking for a chance to record on Gabriel's Real World Records. Gabriel invited him to a \\"recording week\\" at his studio, which led to his membership in the Afro Celt Sound System. √ì Lion√°ird joined the session in July 1995 at which Volume 1: Sound Magic was recorded. He appeared on the group's five subsequent studio recordings. He also sings on the Peter Gabriel album OVO. √ì Lion√°ird has released three solo albums on the Real World Records label. The Seven Steps to Mercy (1997) was produced by Michael Brook. The production incorporated sampled nature sounds √ì Lion√°ird had recorded himself. The album includes a recording of the fourteen-year old √ì Lion√°ird singing \\"Aisling Gheal\\" in 1978. It was followed in 2005 by Invisible Fields, which √ì Lion√°ird produced himself, and in 2011 by Foxlight, which was produced by Leo Abrahams. His 2000 album I Could Read the Sky, also on Real World Records, is the soundtrack to the 1999 film of the same name. He sings on √Åilleacht, a 2005 album by P√°draig√≠n N√≠ Uallach√°in. Several composers, including Gavin Bryars and Donnacha Dennehy, have written works for √ì Lion√°ird. Bryars first wrote a song arrangement for voice and viols that appeared on the 2005 album Invisible Fields. He went on to write a major work, An√°il D√© (The Breath of God) for √ì Lion√°ird and members of the Crash Ensemble. √ì Lion√°ird suggested the title and the texts for the piece, which is based on a collection of Irish prayers and poems. It was performed for the first time in Dublin in November 2008. √ì Lion√°ird collaborated with Donnacha Dennehy during Dennehy's research for and composition of Gr√° agus B√°s, a work that \\"incorporates traditional sean nos singing within a contemporary music idiom\\". Commissioned by Trinity College, Dublin, the work was first performed in Dublin in February 2007 by √ì Lion√°ird and the Crash Ensemble with Alan Pierson conducting. It had its United States premiere at the Merkin Concert Hall in New York City in March 2007, in what the New York Times called a \\"powerful account\\" of a \\"magnificently energetic, wildly cacophonous vocal work\\". √ì Lion√°ird sang the piece at Carnegie Hall in May 2013 in a concert of Dennehy's music with the Crash Ensemble and Dawn Upshaw. Nonesuch Records released a CD recording entitled Gr√° Agus B√°s containing this and other works by Dennehy in May 2011. Along with fiddlers Martin Hayes and Caoimh√≠n √ì Raghallaigh, guitarist Dennis Cahill, and pianist Doveman, √ì Lion√°ird is a member of The Gloaming, an Irish-American supergroup whose self-titled first album was released in 2014, winning the Meteor Choice Music Prize for Irish album of the year. From September 2016 √ì Lion√°ird appeared in The Hunger, an opera by Donnacha Dennehy about the Great Famine. Other work In 2013 University College Cork appointed √ì Lion√°ird the School of Music and Theatre's first Traditional Artist in Residence. In that capacity he gave lectures and taught sean-n√≥s singing, as well as performing. √ì Lion√°ird appears in the 2015 film Brooklyn. He has said that he was reluctant to take the role \\"because I'm not an actor\\" but that he decided to accept when he learned that Colm T√≥ib√≠n, the author of the novel on which the film was based, had asked the film's director to ask him. √ì Lion√°ird plays Frankie Doran, a poor workingman who sings the traditional song \\"Casadh an tS√∫g√°in\\" (Twisting the Rope) during Christmas dinner at a soup kitchen. In May 2015 √ì Lion√°ird hosted a five-part radio documentary series about singing entitled Vocal Chords, which drew on \\"personal experience, academic contributions and a global cast of vocalists\\" including Sin√©ad O'Connor and Christy Moore. Personal life √ì Lion√°ird earned a Master of Arts degree in ethnomusicology from the University of Limerick in 2003. He lives in Inistioge in County Kilkenny with his wife Eimear and their three children.

NJA's slogan was \\"a Jewish voice among progressives and a progressive voice among Jews.\\" New Jewish Agenda demonstrated commitment to participatory (grassroots) democracy and civil rights for all people, especially those marginalized within the mainstream Jewish community. NJA was most controversial for its stances on the rights of Palestinians and Lesbian and Gay Jews. History Over 1,200 people attended NJA's founding conference on December 25, 1980, representing members of Orthodox, Conservative, Reconstructionist, and Reform, synagogues.Mark, Jonathan. \\"Toward a New Jewish Agenda: The Left's Last Chance,\\" New Jewish Times, 23-26. The date was purposely chosen to coincide with Christmas.Perlstein, Donny with Gerry Serotta. \\"Jewish Renewal: The birth of an organization whose time has come,\\" Genesis 2, Sept/Oct 1980 / Tishri 5741 At the founding conference, a 25-member Executive Committee (EC) was elected. The EC agreed that the straw-poll resolutions should function as guides and not mandates of NJA policy, and proposed establishing taskforces for each proposal area.Nepon, Emily. \\"New Jewish Agenda: The History of an Organization, 1980-1992.\\" BA Thesis, Goddard College, 2006 Many of the original members were Jewish organizers active in movements for peace and de-militarization, civil-liberties, civil rights, women's liberation, and those critical of Israeli policies. New Jewish Agenda used specifically Jewish cultural symbols and gatherings in their organizing, a common strategy in our current political era.Solomonow, Allan. \\"A New Agenda for American Jews\\" WIN Feb 15 1981 For example, NJA wrote and revised Jewish prayers and High Holy Day services to reflect Feminist, Secular, and other non-traditional Jewish communities. They also used Jewish ritual in protest ‚Äì for example, the Disarmament taskforce built a sukkah across the street from the White House. Though NJA members identified their activism as explicitly Jewish, they were met with mixed and often critical response from the larger Jewish community. At a November 28, 1982 Delegates Conference in NYC, 65 elected representatives of NJA chapters and at-large members from across US, consented on a National Platform. The Platform included a general Statement of Purpose and specific statements on 18 issue areas. =Topic headings of each issue area= *Jewish Communal Life in the United States *New Jewish Agenda's Feminist Commitment *Women in the Work Force, Family, and Reproductive Rights *Gay and Lesbian Jews *Jews with Disabilities *Anti-Semitism *Racism *Affirmative Action *Civil Liberties *Energy and Environment *Economic Justice *The Labor Movement *Relations between Israel and North American Jewry *Internal Social Life in Israel *Israel, the Palestinians, and Arab Neighbors *Israel and the International Community *World Jewry and Threatened Jewish Communities (Soviet, Ethiopian, Argentine Jews) *Militarism and the Nuclear Arms Race NJA campaigns New Jewish Agenda maintained five primary campaigns through National Taskforces on Middle East Peace, Worldwide Nuclear Disarmament, Economic and Social Justice, Peace in Central America, and Jewish Feminism. Each taskforce coordinated work at the local and national level using organizing methods including national speaking tours, publications, newsletters, national taskforce gatherings, and conferences. Within many of the taskforces, and occasionally outside of the taskforces' wide subject areas, NJA members often established more focused Working Groups. =Economic and Social Justice Taskforce= New Jewish Agenda chapters around the country were active in coalitions to combat racism, anti-Semitism and apartheid.\\"Jewish Groups Protest at Embassy: Prayers, Menorahs part of Anti- Apartheid Vigil\\". Washington Post NJA sponsored vigils outside South African consulates in five U.S. cities which \\"received press from Seattle to Wash, DC and from Paris to Cape Town,\\" according to a 1986 report-back. NJA also organized a six-week tour featuring one of South Africa's most prominent rabbis active in the anti-apartheid movement, Ben Isaacson, and a leading Black South African minister, Rev. Zachariah Mokgebo.\\"March Called a Success.\\" Jewish Week of Maryland, Virginia and Washington DC, 1983 A conference on Anti-Semitism and Racism called \\"Carrying It On: Organizing Against Anti- Semitism and Racism for Jewish Activist and College Students\\" was held in Philadelphia in November 1991. Over 500 Jewish activists and allies from other communities gathered for workshops aiming to learn about and mobilize against institutionalized racism in the U.S. and to analyze the relationship between anti-Semitism and racism.Milner, Jenney and Donna Spiegelman. \\"Carrying It On: a report from the NJA Convergence on Organizing Against Racism and Anti- Semitism.\\" Bridges Journal. 3:1 (Spring/Summer 1992): 138-147. Julian Bond, African-American SNCC founder, Georgia senator, and future chairman of the NAACP (1998-2010), offered a Keynote speech detailing the history of black- Jewish relations over the past 250 years in the U.S. NJA organized the Jewish contingent for the 1983 20th Anniversary March on Washington for Jobs, Peace, and Freedom and a Friday night event (Shabbat service and celebration), which brought together over 500 people. The images of hundreds of Jews marching with a 24-foot banner that read \\"Justice, Justice Thou Shall Pursue\\" created an opportunity to build bridges and demonstrate commitment to the weekend's themes. The Friday night gathering included speeches by Martin Luther King III and Susannah Heschel (whose father, Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, had been a close comrade of Dr. King). =Feminist Taskforce= Jewish Feminist leadership was part of NJA's culture from its earliest days, and the 1985 Conference passed a resolution to begin a Feminist Taskforce (FTF). The national FTF encouraged local chapters to form their own feminist taskforces and work on recruiting women to NJA who would be interested in that work. New Jewish Agenda's feminist taskforce was heavily influenced by the work of many non-Jewish feminists of color who had been challenging the white-dominated culture of the larger feminist movement, and making space for complicated conversations about overlapping identities.Kinberg,Clare. \\"The Challenge of Difference at Bridges.\\" In The Narrow Bridge: Jewish Views on Multiculturalism, edited by Marla Brettschneider. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers Univ Press, 1996. (27-41) One of the FTF's projects was Gesher (Bridge), a newsletter that included reports from each chapter's FTF, and raised feminist issues within NJA. Gesher later became the Jewish Feminist journal Bridges, which continued to be published until June, 2011.Rogow, Faith. \\"Why is this Decade Different from all Other Decades?: A Look at the rise of Jewish Lesbian Feminism.\\" Bridges: A Journal for Jewish Feminists and our Friends. 1.1 (Spring 1990): 67-77. NJA sent a delegation to the UN Decade for Women Forum in 1985 in Nairobi. The delegation organized a successful feminist Jewish, African-American and Arab dialogue at the 1985 Forum. Also, at the Forum an Israeli-Jew and a Palestinian-Arab from the Gaza Strip spoke to a crowd of over 400. This was an especially meaningful achievement because the two previous UN Women's Forums had been divided over a \\"Zionism equals Racism\\" resolution. NJA was able to coordinate meetings at the Forum that led to the initiation of a Palestinian/Israeli women's organization.Thompson, Becky. A Promise and a Way of Life: White Antiracist Activism. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press 2001. (\\"Seeking a Critical Mass, Ample Work to Be Done.\\" 177-207) After the 1985 Forum, NJA attendees spoke around the country about the process and outcomes of organizing for it. In 1985, NJA published and widely distributed a pamphlet called \\"Coming Out/Coming Home\\" about homophobia and gay rights within the Jewish community. They also spearheaded anti- homophobia work which included the development of workshops mobilizing the Jewish community to take part in many gay rights events. In April 1986, the Brooklyn and Manhattan chapters of NJA sponsored the first New York community- wide conference on Lesbian and Gay Jews. In 1987, NJA organized a Jewish contingent and Havdallah service at the October 12 March on Washington for gay rights. The day after that historic march, many took part in a civil disobedience action at the Supreme Court of the United States regarding the Hardwick decision (which ruled no legal privacy for gay sex) and for civil rights for people with AIDS.Pogrebin, Letty Cottin. Deborah, Golda, and Me: Being Female and Jewish in America. New York: Crown Publishers, 1991. At the National Taskforce meeting in September 1987, the FTF committed to talking about issues of \\"Family\\" as a 2-year campaign, and went about the work of creating dialogue about both traditional and non-traditional families within the Jewish community. On Mother's Day 1988, the FTF convened a conference in Philadelphia on Women and Poverty. A panel discussion led by Adrienne Rich addressed the reality of high poverty rates among all women and discussed how stereotypes of Jewish wealth work to hide the poverty many Jewish women struggle with. A few days later, on May 19, 1988, the FTF put on a program in New York City called \\"No More Family Secrets: Now We're Talking,\\" co-sponsored with the National Council of Jewish Women. The event started with a presentation talking about battered Jewish women and Jewish incest survivors. The work of the Feminist Taskforce covered ground that overlapped with many of the other campaigns, and the FTF housed both the Gay/Lesbian Working Group and the AIDS Working Group. AIDS was always on the NJA agenda, especially as an issue to promote within Jewish communities.Kramer, Larry. Reports from the Holocaust: The Making of an AIDS activist. New York, St. Martin's Press: 1989. The AIDS Working Group was founded in July 1986 as a program of the FTF, and soon NJA Chapters reported AIDS activism at the local level. At the 1987 National Convention at UCLA, the AIDS Working Group presented a workshop on \\"AIDS in the Jewish community.\\" =Middle East Peace Taskforce= Despite the New Jewish Agenda's emphasis on multi-issue organizing, The Middle East Task Force (METF) was central to NJA's work. NJA joined a field that was still deeply controversial and heated within the Jewish community. NJA was the only American Jewish organization that clearly opposed the 1982 Lebanon War from its onset. In June 1982, shortly after Agenda's founding, NJA took out a full- page New York Times ad criticizing and denouncing the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Local chapters were able to mobilize first, including a public statement by NJA's Washington DC chapter two days after the June 6th Israeli invasion of Lebanon, a statement and protest vigil by the Massachusetts chapter, and a City Hall protest by Philadelphia NJA. NJA also organized town meetings featuring foreign policy expert Noam Chomsky.\\"New Jewish Agenda Convention Urges Recognition of PLO\\" MERIP OCT-DEC 1985 In 1983, NJA circulated a petition for a \\"Freeze on Settlements in the West Bank.\\" It was signed by 5,000 American Jews and enabled a public education campaign about the effects of settlement policies on the Middle East peace process. NJA then brought the Settlement Freeze petition to the General Assembly of the Council of Jewish Federations. New Jewish Agenda also led two intensive political study missions to Israel and the occupied territories in the summers of 1983 and 1984, meeting with academics, journalists and leading political figures. A later tour led to the creation of the 1991 video \\"This is the Moment: Israelis and Palestinians Talk.\\"Rosenblit, Avi Daniel. \\"The New Jewish Agenda and the Lebanon War: Negotiating a discourse in pro-Israel American Jewish identity, 1980-1983\\" American Studies Undergraduate Honors Thesis, Northwestern University (5. 9.2003). NJA protested Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin when he spoke in Los Angeles in 1982. In November 1983, NJA protested Ariel Sharon at a Hebrew Academy banquet in San Francisco and over 2,000 demonstrators turned out. In 1985, NJA joined protests against violent anti- Arab activities in Los Angeles. In early 1988, NJA supported Israeli peace groups' mobilization of progressive representatives at the 31st World Zionist Congress (WZC). In the year before the WZC, NJA collected 650 new members for \\"Americans for Peace in Israel\\", the US affiliate of Mapam. New Jewish Agenda and American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) co-sponsored a national speaking tour (in 1984) of Peace Now leader Mordechai Bar-on (a former IDF officer and member of Israeli Knesset) and Mohammed Milhem (deposed West Bank Palestinian Mayor), resulting in a PBS television special, \\"The Arab and the Israeli\\". These speaking tour dialogues were followed by local discussions between American Jewish and Arab communities. NJA also sponsored a tour of a founding member of the Committee Against the War in Lebanon and a member of the Israeli Committee in Solidarity with Bir Zeit University. =Worldwide Nuclear Disarmament Taskforce= NJA successfully lobbied a resolution to the 1982 General Assembly of the Council of Jewish Federations (CJF), for the passage of a multi-lateral nuclear arms freeze. The CJF resolution had powerful effects in the larger Jewish community, prompting other major Jewish organizations, including the American Jewish Congress and B'nai Brith, to issue similar statements. Arthur Waskow formed another Jewish organization, The Shalom Center, in 1983 to focus on peace and anti-nuclear activism from a Jewish perspective.Waskow, Rabbi Arthur. Seasons of our Joy . Boston: Beacon Press, 1982 In 1981, observance of Tisha B'Av coincided with the anniversary of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki by the U.S. during World War II. The occasion was marked by NJA with traditional observance of Tisha B'Av near the White House and the Soviet Embassy. These were buildings symbolic of the nuclear super-powers, thus marking the shared symbolism of the potential danger of world-destruction. In 1984, NJA chapters sponsored scores of Sukkat Shalom (Shelter of Peace) and Rainbow Sign celebrations, linking traditional Jewish observances with the call for nuclear disarmament. NJA built a sukkah in Lafayette Park across from the White House in order to draw attention to their anti-nuclear organizing.Sukkat Shalom: Jews Seek to End Nuclear Arms Race. Jewish Exponent, 1984 500 NJA members marched in the June 12, 1982 Disarmament Rally in New York, which was at that time the largest Disarmament Rally in American history.Jews Join Thousands in Rally for Peace. Jewish Exponent, 1982 In 1985, NJA brought a large delegation to the Mobilization for Justice and Peace in Washington, DC. In 1986, NJA co-sponsored the Boston University conference \\"Judaism, War and the Nuclear Arms Race.\\" Following a 1986 Shalom Center Training Institute for disarmament activists, taskforce members became increasingly interested in making connections between disarmament and human rights issues, especially as applied to solidarity with Soviet Jewry, including participation in a demonstration on the Mall in Washington in December 1987, on the eve of a Ronald Reagan-Mikhail Gorbachev summit. At the time, Soviet Jews were facing anti-Semitism and political repression while struggling to emigrate in large numbers to the U.S. and Israel. =Central American Solidarity Taskforce= NJA sponsored a 1984 delegation of national Jewish leaders to Nicaragua to examine human rights conditions and investigate U.S. Government allegations of anti-Semitic policies pursued by the Sandinista government. The delegation came back with a report that the Sandinistas were not engaging in anti-Semitic behavior or policies and in fact that Nicaragua was willing to resume diplomatic talks with Israel and to oppose any forms of anti-Semitism.\\"Jewish Group Finds No Anti-Semitism by Sandinista Regime\\" Washington Post Through widespread publicity, the 1984 delegation was able to make great strides in discrediting the Reagan administration's attempts to mobilize the American Jewish community support for the Contras. NJA sent down many more delegations to Central America, joined with other peace groups for lobbying and speaking out against U.S. aid to the Contras, and represented the Jewish community in both the Pledge of Resistance coalition and the Inter-Religious Task Force on Central America. NJA took special notice of the Sanctuary movement, which had formerly been a movement of progressive churches, inspired by the Liberation Theology movement. In less than a year, over twenty synagogues were active in the sanctuary movement. This was accomplished in part by distributing educational packets on the issues to over 2,000 rabbis and synagogues and by publishing articles and letters to the editor. NJA also distributed two brochures about the concerns that had kept progressive Jews from responding to Central American crisis and the scriptural commandments that obligate Jews to harbor the persecuted and protect them from harm.\\"Jewish Activists Urge Synagogues to Shelter Latin American Refugees\\" LA Times In 1986, NJA sponsored national speaking tours by three rabbis whose congregations have offered sanctuary to Central American refugees. Agenda's \\"Jewish Witness for Peace\\" delegation created a 30-minute video called \\"Crossing Borders\\" which was distributed within the Jewish community as an educational tool. Post-Agenda New Jewish Agenda was a leadership incubator which contributed to the formation of many more focused and single-issue organizations before it shut down in 1992. There is no conclusive agreement as to the reasons behind NJA's official disbanding, but it is thought to have been in large part due to long-term debt, at one point reaching $60,000 and possibly higher.\\"New Jewish Agenda Folds its Tent.\\" Bridges Journal.4:1 (Winter/Spring 1994) NJA was also isolated because the mainstream Jewish community did not agree with its positions regarding Israel/Palestine and the status of Lesbian and Gay Jews. NJA helped with the development of other left wing Jewish organizations, including Americans for Peace Now,The New Israel Fund, Jewish Fund for Justice, The Shalom Center, The Shefa Fund, Bridges Journal, American Friends of Neve Shalom, Brit Tzedek v'Shalom, Bat Shalom, and The Abraham Fund. It also built liaisons with older organizations such as the Jewish Peace Fellowship.

Construction of the Grand Palais began in 1897 following the demolition of the Palais de l'Industrie (Palace of Industry) as part of the preparation works for the Universal Exposition of 1900, which also included the creation of the adjacent Petit Palais and Pont Alexandre III. It has been listed since 2000 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture. Grand Palais The structure was built in the style of Beaux-Arts architecture as taught by the √âcole des Beaux-Arts of Paris. The building reflects the movement's taste for ornate decoration through its stone facades, the formality of its floor planning and the use of techniques that were innovative at the time, such as its glass vault, its structure made of iron and light steel framing, and its use of reinforced concrete.  History  One of its pediments calls it a \\"monument dedicated by the Republic to the glory of French art\\", reflecting its original purpose, that of housing the great artistic events of the city of Paris. The competition to choose the architect was fierce and controversial, and ultimately resulted in the contract being awarded to a group of four architects, Henri Deglane, Albert Louvet, Albert Thomas and Charles Girault, each with a separate area of responsibility. The main space, almost 240 metres long, was constructed with an iron, steel and glass barrel-vaulted roof, making it the last of the large transparent structures inspired by London‚Äôs Crystal Palace that were necessary for large gatherings of people before the age of electricity. The main space was originally connected to the other parts of the palace along an east-west axis by a grand staircase in a style combining Classical and Art Nouveau, but the interior layout has since been somewhat modified. The exterior of this massive palace combines an imposing Classical stone fa√ßade with a riot of Art Nouveau ironwork, and a number of allegorical statue groups including work by sculptors Paul Gasq, Camille Lef√®vre, Alfred Boucher, Alphonse-Am√©d√©e Cordonnier and Raoul Verlet. A monumental bronze quadriga by Georges R√©cipon tops each wing of the main fa√ßade. The one on the Champs-√âlys√©es side depicts Immortality prevailing over Time, the one on the Seine side Harmony triumphing over Discord. The grand inauguration took place 1 May 1900, and from the very beginning the palace was the site of different kinds of shows in addition to the intended art exhibitions. These included a riding competition that took place annually from 1901 to 1957, but were mainly dedicated to innovation and modernity: the automobile, aviation, household appliances, and so on. The golden age of the art exhibitions as such lasted for some thirty years, while the last took place in 1947. The first major Henri Matisse retrospective after his death was held at the Grand Palais. The structure had problems that started even before it was completed, mainly as a result of subsidence caused by a drop in the water table. The builders attempted to compensate for this subsidence, and for a tendency of the ground to shift, by sinking supporting posts down to firmer soil, since construction could not be delayed. These measures were only partially successful. Further damage occurred once the building was in use. Excessive force applied to structural members during the installation of certain exhibitions such as the Exposition Internationale de la Locomotion A√©rienne caused damage, as did acid runoff from the horse shows. Additional problems due to the construction of the building itself revealed themselves over the course of time. Differential rates of expansion and contraction between cast iron and steel members, for example, allowed for water to enter, leading to corrosion and further weakening. When finally one of the glass ceiling panels fell in 1993, the main space had to be closed for restoration work, and was not fully reopened to the public until 2007.  Wartime and the Palais  Grand Palais during World War I, 1916 The Palais served as a military hospital during World War I, employing local artists who had not been deployed to the front to decorate hospital rooms or to make moulds for prosthetic limbs. The Nazis put the Palais to use during the Occupation of France in World War II. First used as a truck depot, the Palais then housed two Nazi propaganda exhibitions. The Parisian resistance used the Grand Palais as a headquarters during the Liberation of Paris. On 23 August 1944 an advancing German column was fired upon from a window on the Avenue de S√®lves, and the Germans responded with a tank attack upon the Palais.

During his career Mason was involved in a number of controversial off-field incidents which have received media publicity due to his high profile in the NRL. Early life Mason was born in Auckland, New Zealand to an Australian father and a Tongan mother, Mason moved to Australia at a young age and grew up in Toronto, New South Wales playing his junior football for the Toronto Macquarie Scorpions and the Lakes United Seagulls.

In Round 13 of the 2000 NRL season he made his NRL d√©but for the Bulldogs against the Penrith Panthers after first- grader Darren Britt suffered an injury. He became a regular first-grader for the rest of the season. After the 2000 season, Mason made his international d√©but for Tonga, his mother's country of origin, in the 2000 Rugby League World Cup played in Great Britain and Ireland. In 2002, Mason was reported to have run from a taxi to avoid paying the fare. After the 2002 NRL season, Mason was selected to make his d√©but for Australia against Great Britain. He scored a try on debut. During 2003, Mason earned a call-up to make his d√©but for New South Wales in Game 3 of the 2003 State of Origin series. After the 2003 NRL season, he went on the 2003 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France, helping Australia to victory over Great Britain in what would be the last time the two nations contested an Ashes series. In 2003, he tested positive to an illicit social drug, reported to be an amphetamine, and was fined $25,000 by his club. Mason has never commented on the issue publicly.

The next season the Dogs reached the 2004 NRL Grand Final and triumphed 16‚Äì13 over the Sydney Roosters. Mason was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal for Man of the Match. He was selected in the Australian team to go and compete in the end of season 2004 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament. In the final against Great Britain Mason played from the interchange bench and scored a try in the Kangaroos' 44‚Äì4 victory. Also at the end of 2004, Mason played in Australia's win over the United States in an international rugby league friendly match at Philadelphia's Franklin Field but suffered a fractured ankle. Mason was out of action during the first half of the 2005 NRL season and did not play in the NRL until Round 18 where the Bulldogs. He played in the 2005 Tri-nations tournament. In June 2006, news speculation surfaced that Mason was considering joining the United States' National Football League (NFL), a childhood dream. He was said to be courted by several teams, including the Oakland Raiders and San Francisco 49ers. In July it was confirmed the New York Giants had offered him the opportunity to trial with them after the Rugby League Tri-Nations series finished in November. However, the Canterbury club had dismissed the deal, and Mason remained with the club beyond 2006. In 2006, Willie returned to become a regular member of the Bulldogs team where he managed to play 20 club matches, all three Origin games for NSW ‚Äì in which he was named Man of the Match in the opening game and three Tests for Australia in the 2006 Tri-Nations series. He was a firm figure in the clubs return to finals football as the Bulldogs finished second on the ladder, the Dogs were beaten by eventual Premiers the Brisbane Broncos one game shy of the Grand Final. Mason was televised appearing to swear during the New Zealand haka, before game 1 of the 2006 Gillette Tri-nations Series. Later in the match Mason suffered a swollen black eye and suspected broken eye socket from a shoulder charge by David Kidwell. Mason explained that his swearing was in response to the traditional MƒÅori dance being performed by Brent Webb, an Indigenous Australian of Torres Strait Islander origin who became a New Zealand citizen. Mason was banned for one game and fined $5,000 following an altercation with Stuart Fielden during Great Britain's victory over Australia in November 2006. In December 2006 Mason took part in a trial with the New York Jets, but still maintained he would fulfil his contract with the Bulldogs until the end of the 2009 season. Mason said \\"I'm probably at the time in my career now where maybe it is time for a change. New York City is the capital of the world. I'm pretty sure I could settle in there if given the opportunity...\\" However a Jets representative stated that Mason even being offered a contract was very unlikely, \\"I don't think they were even football drills, it was more of a visit. We just had a look at him and that is where we left it.\\" The Jets coach Eric Mangini was impressed with Mason, saying \\"Willie is a guy that came to our attention, he is a pretty good rugby player, and it was just one of those opportunities we had, where we have to take a look at him. What we're doing is taking a look at him, seeing what potential there is for him. He seems to have been a pretty dynamic guy in that league for a long time. He seemed relatively feisty when I spoke to him.\\" The Bulldogs never anticipated any move, saying \\"Willie has given us his guarantee he will be with us.\\" Mason was selected to play for the Australian national team at second-row forward the 2007 ANZAC Test match victory against New Zealand. A few weeks later he was involved in a nightclub altercation with the out-spoken Richie Williams, who Mason claimed shows no respect to the older players in the NRL and is a cocky kid who has yet to prove himself in the NRL. Mason was voted the most hated player by a fans poll in 2007. At Sydney Airport in 2007, Mason verbally challenged a female reporter from radio station 2GB, resulting in a complaint from 2GB to the Bulldogs club and the ARL Mason later admitted to the outburst, which was captured on audio recordings, and apologised to 2GB journalist Michelle Keighran. Mason is sponsored by sportswear manufacturer, Champion, which almost severed its contract with the controversial footballer as a result of the incident. In 2007, Mason was selected for all three Origin games for NSW and represented Australia in the ANZAC Test match. At the conclusion of the 2007 NRL season, the media began reporting that Mason was unhappy at the Bulldogs. On 31 October 2007 The Daily Telegraph reported that Mason wanted to leave the Bulldogs after an altercation with the club's CEO, Malcolm Noad. A day later it was reported that Mason was to be released from the final two years of his contract after the club rejected his chance to fight in a professional boxing match worth up to 100,000 and because the club claimed to be fining Mason $50,000 for failure to attend an end of season function, although this was denied by the Bulldogs. Speculation that Mason was to be released from his contract led to a number of English and Australian clubs confirming they were seeking to sign Mason to a contract for the 2008 season. After the Roosters were able to release back-rower Ashley Harrison to the Gold Coast Titans and considered releasing other players, the club was able to make an offer for Mason. On 15 November 2007 it was confirmed that Mason had signed a three-year deal with the Sydney Roosters. =Sydney Roosters= Mason while playing for the Roosters in 2008 In February 2008, Mason and his new Roosters teammate Anthony Tupou were charged with urinating in a public place during a visit to Port Macquarie. In August 2008, Mason was named in both the preliminary 46-man Kangaroos squad for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup and the Tonga training squad. However, in the final regular game of the season Mason ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in his knee and took no part in the Roosters Finals Campaign. Mason missed the Roosters first game of the 2009 season after they were trashed by South Sydney Rabbitohs 52‚Äì12. Mason returned in Round 2, against the Canberra Raiders they were victors 30‚Äì4. In May 2009 Mason was fined $2,000 by Sydney Roosters after being photographed urinating in a public place. He was also dropped to the Newtown Jets. The Roosters finished the year in last spot. When Brian Smith took over the coaching role at the Roosters he told Mason he was not in his future plans at the Roosters and his services were no long needed there. Interest in Mason was said to be high with a number of high-profile rugby union and rugby league clubs chasing Mason's signature, Japanese Rugby Union teams, French Super League team Catalans Dragons and the Queensland Reds were just some of the clubs after Mason. He was given extended leave from the Roosters to find a new club. There were also some rumours he was going to join the Newcastle Knights late in the year, but the Knights denied any relation to him. The North Queensland Cowboys made a late play for Willie Mason and held talks with him on 2 February 2010 If the Cowboys had rejected Mason the Newcastle Knights were poised to make a deal with him as they had lost prop Danny Wicks =North Queensland Cowboys= On 5 February 2010, Mason agreed to a one-year contract with the North Queensland Cowboys. On the same day that Lote Tuqiri announced that he would be returning to the NRL it was announced that Willie Mason had signed a one- year deal with the North Queensland Cowboys. He made his Cowboys d√©but off the bench in a 30‚Äì24 loss to the Broncos in Round 1, 2010. =Super League= In September 2011, Mason signed a three-year contract with Hull Kingston Rovers, pending a successful working visa application. Six months into his contract, Hull KR were forced to release Mason as he was unable to obtain a Tongan passport that would have enabled him to come off their overseas quota. =Newcastle Knights= On 18 April 2012, it was confirmed Mason had signed with the Wayne Bennett coached Newcastle Knights for the remainder of the 2012 NRL season. He made his Newcastle d√©but at Hunter Stadium in their Round 8 victory over the Penrith Panthers. Mason's younger brother Rodney was also playing rugby league with the Newcastle Knights at the time. On 15 November 2012, Mason re-signed with the Knights for two years. On 10 March 2014, Mason was disqualified from driving for six months and fined $900 for drink driving. The offence was in relation to Australia Day of that year where after a marathon drinking session, Mason drove to training, was pulled over by police and blew a blood alcohol reading of 0.09.https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/10/willie-mason-drink-driving- fine-ban-newcastle-knights =Manly Warringah Sea Eagles= On 28 October 2014, after a three-year stint with the Knights, Mason signed a one-year contract with the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles starting in 2015. On May 13, 2015, Mason was in the spotlight again, this time for being grabbed by Newcastle player Korbin Sims on the genitals in Manly's 30-10 loss to Newcastle at Brookvale Oval. Sims tried to laugh off the incident by saying \\"I apologise to the fans, the NRL and people involved with the game and the club, if anyone found it inappropriate,‚Äù Sims told Fairfax Media. \\"It was merely meant to be a harmless gesture between two friends.\\"https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/nrl- video-2015-korbin-sims-says-willie-mason-genital-grab-was-harmless- gesture/news-story/8e06fbdb5bd2b25716e9bc264930b680 In 2018, Mason spoke to the media about his time at Manly in relation to the ongoing saga with the board infighting and coach Trent Barrett claiming the facilities at the club were not up to date. Mason said \\"I spent my last year there in 2015 so I understand where a lot of the backlash is coming from, back then we were getting changed out of our cars, out of our boots. It was pretty unprofessional. Only three years ago you're getting changed out of your f****n boot. It's ridiculous and they've only got their shit together now because Trent Barrett kicked up a stink. We had to share weights with the Australian touch team and union, there was about four or five clubs in there. I'd hate to be a part of the club at the moment... it's a very proud club but it's in shambles at the moment. I feel sorry for all the players\\".https://www.sportingnews.com/au/league/news/manly-sea-eagles- resources-trent-barrett-willie-mason/4o389q46suis19rtbkc6qgypu =Catalans Dragons= On 16 February 2016, Mason returned to the Super League with Catalans Dragons, signing a one-year contract starting effective immediately. Rugby union After being released by Hull KR, Mason signed with Top 14 rugby union side, Toulon in April 2011. He was seen by Toulon as a possible successor to former Bulldogs teammate and past Toulon centre Sonny Bill Williams. In June Mason was selected to play for Barbarian F.C. from the interchange bench in their victory against Wales. In December Toulon agreed to release Mason as he was reportedly unhappy in rugby union. Mason was described by Toulon fans as \\"the biggest flop\\" in the club's history. Post playing In 2017, Mason was scheduled to appear as a celebrity contestant on Seven Network's Australian version of Hell's Kitchen. In July 2017, Mason branded former professional rugby league footballer Tommy Raudonikis an idiot after Raudonikis said that Jarryd Hayne had failed in the NFL and accused him of not trying while playing for the Gold Coast Titans. Mason rushed to Hayne's defense saying ‚ÄúHe had a contract, he sold the most jerseys in the NFL ... I just don‚Äôt like it when you get uneducated people on there who hammer people about absolute rubbish, Tommy should just shut his mouth, I hate how everybody is coming out and bagging him about his money. He‚Äôs earning $1.2 million, who cares?, you get these idiots from the 70s and 80s bashing him\\".https://www.news.com.au/sport/nrl/willie-mason-slams-tommy-raudonikiss- jarryd-hayne-commentary/news-story/ee9a4d1faecdf5ece90133fa7e4934ab In June 2018, Mason claimed that when he was at Manly that nobody wanted to play alongside teammate Daly Cherry-Evans and that he was the reason there was such a divide at the club. Mason went on to say ‚ÄúI was there in 2015, I‚Äôve never seen, never been involved in a team, that I could just see such a divide in a club, It was because of Cherry-Evans. All this shit that‚Äôs been happening around him, like, something‚Äôs wrong, ‚ÄúHe then signed with the Gold Coast Titans for like 10 years,‚Äù Mason said. ‚ÄúAnd then there was a big f‚Ä¶.. meeting, Cherry-Evans has got something to say. ‚ÄúI just signed a deal with the Titans boys, blah blah blah\\". ‚ÄúI‚Äôm like, who gives a f‚Ä¶, you don‚Äôt hold a meeting about that. No one cared\\" Mason's comments came in the wake of former Manly player Anthony Watmough commenting on a podcast calling Cherry-Evans a \\"Fuckwit\\" and that he was the reason other players needed to depart the club.https://www.sportingnews.com/au/league/news/willie-mason-daly-cherry- evans-anthony-watmough-manly-sea-eagles/zmuxq88br1zd1lr9x0grw7srx ReferencesExternal links *Catalans Dragons profile *2008 interview from Ralph magazine *Sydney Roosters profile *Willie Mason NRL Player Profile *State of Origin Official website Rugby League Player Stats *Article at smh.com.au *Mason cleared of wrist surgery Category:1980 births Category:New Zealand people of Australian descent Category:New Zealand people of Tongan descent Category:Tongan emigrants to Australia Category:Rugby league players from Auckland Category:People from New South Wales Category:Australian rugby league players Category:Macquarie Scorpions players Category:Lakes United Seagulls players Category:Valentine-Eleebana Red Devils players Category:Rugby league second-rows Category:Rugby league props Category:Australia national rugby league team players Category:Tonga national rugby league team players Category:Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs players Category:Sydney Roosters players Category:North Queensland Cowboys players Category:Hull Kingston Rovers players Category:Manly Warringah Sea Eagles players Category:Newtown Jets NSW Cup players Category:Newcastle Knights players Category:Country New South Wales Origin rugby league team players Category:New South Wales Rugby League State of Origin players Category:NRL All Stars players Category:Clive Churchill Medal winners Category:Barbarian F.C. players Category:Living people ","title":"Willie Mason"},{"id":"2730739","title":"Travel to Romantis"},{"id":"2730746","text":"Port Kirwan is a small incorporated fishing community located on the southern shore of the Avalon Peninsula, Newfoundland, Canada.

After a short period of pre-production at Dirk Riegner's studio, which then was located right beside the grounds of the Zeche Bochum, the band entered Principal Studio in M√ºnster in 2003. Within one week, the instrumental parts were recorded, and for the vocal recordings the band again went to Bochum to the small studio of the producer. Afterwards, the album was mixed on the grounds of the Horus Sound Studios (also Guano Apes etc.) in Hannover at a small studio of mixing engineer Modo Bierkamp. Three months later, the result‚Äîprovided with an artwork by Kai Hoffmann (also Secret Discovery)‚Äî hit the stores on May 5, 2003, and at once met with as much approval as to enter the German charts: On number 98 it only just hit them, but this was quite remarkable for a German band whose sound mainly was and still is influenced by gothic metal.

The B&O; cut back the line to Southwood in the early 1940s and to Hockessin in the late 1950s. Historic Red Clay Valley, Inc. began operating steam tourist trains on weekends in 1966, reusing the old W&W; name, and in August 1982 the W&W; bought the branch from the Chessie System for $25,000, which included Ex-B&O; SW1 #8408 as a part of the purchase. and Under the Historic Red Clay Valley Inc. the operations are managed by a Board of Directors, paid staff and a large number of volunteers. In 1999, the rains of Hurricane Floyd caused considerable damage to the railroad. Two trestles were entirely destroyed by the flooding of Red Clay Creek, which also caused track washouts and damaged several other trestles. The two destroyed bridges were replaced by steel trestles, but the other timber trestles were simply repaired. In 2003, Tropical Storm Henri struck the valley and produced an even more catastrophic flood. While the two steel bridges (and an iron trestle at Ashland) survived the flood, the remaining bridges were swept away or irreparably damaged. Despite the damage caused by these storms, the Wilmington and Western continued to operate on the remaining track, and replaced all of the destroyed bridges with steel trestles. The line officially reopened into Hockessin on June 30, 2007. The railroad celebrated its 50th anniversary operating as a tourist railroad in 2016. Excursions Several different excursions are offered by the Wilmington and Western Railroad, running through the Red Clay Creek valley. Trains operate out of the Greenbank station near the southern end of the railroad. The railroad offers two regular excursions which run on weekends during the operating season. The Hockessin Flyer runs round-trip from Greenbank to the northern end of the line in Hockessin for a 2.5-hour trip with a 30-minute layover in Hockessin. The Mt. Cuba Meteor runs round-trip from Greenbank to the Mount Cuba Picnic Grove for a 1.5-hour trip with a 30-minute layover for a picnic at the Mount Cuba Picnic Grove. The Wilmington and Western Railroad also offers several special themed excursions. Some of the themed excursions include the Easter Bunny Express, the Fireworks Express on Independence Day, a dinner train called the Royal Blue Dinner Train, the Brews on Board train serving craft brews, the Civil War Skirmish Weekend, the Princess Express, the Superhero Express, the Autumn Leaf Special offering views of fall foliage, the Halloween Express, the Holiday Lights Express offering views of Christmas lights, and the Santa Claus Express around Christmas.

The engine was renumbered to 919 in the 1920s and operated under that number until the mid 1950s when it and the rest of the E-10-a class were renumbered from 81-96, where it gained the number 92. 92 and most of the E-10-a class worked branch lines across the system. The engine was taken out of service in the late 1950s during the railroad's transition period to dieselization and was listed as surplus. In 1960 the locomotive was purchased by Thomas C. Marshall Jr. in 1960 for it to run on the Historic Red Clay Valley Inc.'s future railroad. It was moved down to Yorklyn, Delaware where it was rebuilt. It was the first steam locomotive to operate for the railroad when it became a tourist line. The engine operated from Spring of 1966 to Fall of 1972, when the engine was taken out of service due to mechanical issues. The engine is stored in Marshallton, awaiting restoration to operation. *0-4-0F #1 was built for Delaware Power & Light by H.K. Porter in 1950. The Engine is a fireless locomotive, meaning it is a locomotive without a firebox. The locomotive was donated by Delmarva Power in 1981. The engine is currently stored in Marshallton. It will likely never operate at the W&W; due to it being overall too small to operate their large trains. *0-6-0 Switcher #60 was built for the Pennsylvania Railroad in December 1913 classified as a B-6sa. The engine ran until the 1950s when it was taken out of service and purchased by the Cemline Corporation. The engine was purchased by a private owner was moved to Marshallton in the 1970s for storage. The engine was moved to Hockessin and has been sitting on one of the W&W;'s sidings. The locomotive was donated to HRCV in late 2019/early 2020, and now rests on a siding near Mt. Cuba. =Diesel locomotives= W&W; #114 waits for passengers at Brandywine Springs Park *SW-1 #114 was built in 1940 by the Electro-Motive Corporation (EMC) of General Motors for the Lehigh Valley Railroad. The engine operated for the Lehigh Valley Railroad for many years, eventually to be sold to the Maryland Port Authority as a switch engine in Pocomoke City, Maryland. In 1974, it was purchased for excursion service on the Ocean City Western Railroad in Ocean City, Maryland until that railroad shut down in the late 1970s, when the locomotive would go into storage in Snow Hill, Maryland. The engine would be purchased by the HRCV in 1992 in trade for ALCo S-2 #3. The engine has been in excursion and occasional freight service since 1993. This engine is currently stored serviceable. *SW-1 #8408 was built in 1940 by EMC of General Motors for the B&O; and was originally numbered #208 before being renumbered to #8408 in February 1957. The locomotive served the B&O; in freight service on the Landenberg Branch until 1982. It operated on the Tourist Line from 1982 until 2008, when it was taken out of service for a restoration of the locomotive. In 2011, it was shipped to McHugh Locomotive & Equipment in Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania for restoration. The Engine came back to the Wilmington and Western in February 2016, being officially pressed into service on May 28, 2016. The engine is now the main motive power on diesel-powered excursions. =Self-propelled rail car= *Doodlebug #4662 (aka \\"The Paul Revere\\"); built by Pullman Standard for the Pennsylvania Railroad; in 1929. The engine ran for the Pennsylvania Railroad, mostly on Branchlines. The \\"Doodlebug\\" was retired in 1959, being sold to the National Capital Trolley Museum. The engine was purchased by the HRCV in 1967 and has operated since 1979. The engine is one of two Pennsylvania Railroad Doodlebugs still in existence. In early 2017, the \\"Doodlebug\\" was taken out of service to undergo a major rebuild of the front truck. The \\"Doodlebug\\" has returned to service and is operating on select Fridays during July and August 2018. =Passenger cars= *Four DL&W; Boonton passenger cars operate along the railroad. Combine #410, Coach #571, Coach #581, and Coach #603 were built in 1914-15 by the Pullman Company for the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad for commuter service as part of an order for 77 cars. The cars were in commuter service until the late 1950s, when newer passenger cars were pressed into service. The four Boonton passenger cars were purchased by HRCV in the early 1960s for passenger service. The passenger cars have been in service since May 1966. *Open-Air Coach #442 Kiamensi Springs was originally a locomotive-hauled PRR MP54 passenger car built by the Pennsylvania Railroad's Altoona Works in 1912. The car was converted to a MP54E6 EMU between 1950 and 1951 by adding electric traction motors. This coach car was used in commuter service for the Pennsylvania Railroad until being retired by 1978. Coach #442 arrived at the Wilmington and Western Railroad in 1988 and was converted into an open-air car in the late 1990s, entering service on May 23, 1999. *Parlor Car #6795 was built in 1930 by the Pullman Company for the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad as an EMU commuter coach numbered #2548. When the Delaware, Lackawannana & Western Railroad merged with the Erie Railroad to become the Erie Lackawanna Railway in 1960, #2548 was renumbered to #3548. The car was eventually purchased by Philadelphia radio personality Tom Moran, who placed it into storage in Woodstown, New Jersey. Moran painted the car into a Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines scheme and renumbered it to #6795. The Wilmington and Western Railroad purchased #6795 on January 14, 1991 and kept the car in storage until early 2006, when it was restored and converted into a parlor car. =Cabooses= *Caboose #C149 was built by the Erie Railroad at its Dunmore Shops in July 1941. The caboose saw service on the Erie Railroad and later the Erie Lackawanna Railway. In 1976, the Erie Lackawanna Railway became part of Conrail and #C149 was renumbered to #46195. The caboose eventually came to the Wilmington and Western Railroad as #C149 and was used on work trains. The caboose was refurbished in 2000 to be used for passengers and for birthday parties, entering revenue service on April 13, 2001. In 2016, the caboose was taken out of service for a major interior restoration. *Caboose #C2013 was built by the B&O; at its Washington, Indiana shops in 1926 as a class I-5 caboose. It became a class I-5D when steel frame trucks were added. After coming to the Wilmington and Western Railroad, the caboose was restored to its original window placement and a back-up horn and lights were added. In summer 2005, the caboose had new roller-bearing trucks added and the wood siding replaced. In 2006, #C2013 underwent a restoration that reconstructed the interior and repainted the caboose into an authentic B&O; scheme. *Caboose #C2042 was built by the B&O; at its Washington, Indiana shops in August 1926 as a class I-5 caboose. It became a class I-5D when cast frame trucks were added. After coming to the Wilmington and Western Railroad, a back-up horn and lights were added. The caboose underwent an exterior restoration in 2013 that gave it a fresh coat of point, and underwent an interior restoration in 2016.

Codename Icarus is a five-part British children's television drama serial written by Richard Cooper, which was produced by the BBC in 1981. The serial combined elements of teenage drama and conspiracy thriller, and involved child prodigies being manipulated as the basis for a complex scheme involving nuclear missiles and the mysterious Icarus Foundation's plot to take over the world. It starred Barry Angel as child prodigy Martin Smith and Philip Locke as John Doll. Cooper also novelised the serial, which was published by the BBC and Knight Books in 1981. The serial was released on VHS in compilation form by BBC Video in 1985 in the UK, and in 2006 it was made available in its original, unedited episodic format on Region 1 DVD by Home Vision Entertainment in the United States. The location for the scenes when the children were at school was the Redrice, just outside Andover, Hampshire, UK. This school has since been renamed as the Farleigh School. All the child extras came from the Harrow Way Community School in Andover. The credits for all five episodes of the serial bore the captions 'Scientific Advice ‚Äî Professor John Taylor' and 'BBC wishes to thank: Imperial War Museum, Duxford'. Episode 3 'Harlequin' was nominated for 'Best Drama/Light Entertainment' at the 1982 BAFTA Awards. The serial was broadcast twice-weekly, on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, with the original transmission dates being as follows: * Part One ‚Äî 8 December 1981 * Part Two ‚Äî 9 December 1981 * Part Three ‚Äî 15 December 1981 * Part Four ‚Äî 16 December 1981 * Part Five ‚Äî 22 December 1981 In other mediaNovelisation= :Publisher: BBC/Knight Books :Year: 1981 :Author: Richard Cooper :Original Price: ¬£1.25 :ISBN ‚Ññ: 0-340-27535-9 :Availability: Out of print The novelisation was published to tie-in with the broadcast of the serial.

He was most recently the offensive coordinator for the Los Angeles Wildcats of the XFL. He was the head football coach at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, a position he held from December 2011 until November 2015 and previously held the offensive coordinator position for the Utah Utes, UCLA Bruins, the NFL's Tennessee Titans, USC Trojans, NC State Wolfpack, and BYU Cougars.Chris Foster, UCLA hires Norm Chow as offensive coordinator, Los Angeles Times, January 21, 2008. Chow won the 2002 Broyles Award as the nation's top collegiate assistant coach. He also was named the 2002 NCAA Division I-A Offensive Coordinator of the Year by American Football Monthly and was named the National Assistant Coach of the Year in 1999 by the American Football Foundation. He is well known for developing quarterbacks. During his time as an assistant football coach, Chow has helped coach 8 of the top 14 career passing-efficiency leaders and 13 quarterbacks who rank among the top 30 in NCAA history for single-season passing yardage. The list of players he coached includes Jim McMahon, Steve Young, and Philip Rivers, as well as Heisman Trophy winners Ty Detmer, Carson Palmer, and Matt Leinart.

Education and playing career Chow played college football at the University of Utah, and was a two-year starter and a three-year letterman offensive guard for the Utes. In his senior season, Chow was named to the All- WAC first team and gained All-America honorable mention honors. He then played briefly in the Canadian Football League, for the Saskatchewan Roughriders, before an injury ended his professional athletic career. He was selected to Utah's All-Century Team. He graduated from the University of Utah in 1968 with his bachelor's degree in physical education. He received his master's degree in special education from Utah in 1970 and his doctorate in educational psychology, Ed.D., from Brigham Young University in 1978. Coaching careerHigh school= Chow began his coaching career in Hawaii, where he was born, at Waialua High and Intermediate School. He was the head coach there from 1970 to 1972 and posted a 5‚Äì25 record in three seasons. =BYU= In 1973, Chow left for BYU to be a graduate assistant under LaVell Edwards, who was installing an innovative pass-oriented offense. He was promoted to receivers coach in 1976, a post he would hold until 1982 (apart from a one-year stint as running backs coach). In 1979, BYU led the country in passing offense, total offense, and scoring offense during the regular season, and quarterback Jim McMahon finished fifth in the Heisman vote. In 1982, head coach LaVell Edwards named Chow as principal offensive play-caller. Chow continued to call all the offensive plays for the rest of his 17 years at BYU. In 1983, the offense, led by quarterback Steve Young, set NCAA single-season records for pass completion percentage (71.3%) and total yards per game (584.2). Young finished second in the Heisman vote. In 1984, the unbeaten BYU team won the consensus national championship. Quarterback Robbie Bosco finished second in the nation in total passing and third in the Heisman vote. Chow became quarterbacks and receivers coach in 1986. In 1990, the Cougars upset defending national champion and top- ranked Miami, FL., 28-21, with nearly 500 yards of offense and Ty Detmer went on to win the Heisman. In 1996, Chow was officially given the title of assistant head coach / offensive coordinator / quarterback / receivers coach. That season, the Cougars with Steve Sarkisian as quarterback, won the WAC and earned its first ever New Year's Day Bowl. BYU came from behind to beat Kansas State in the Cotton Bowl, and finished with No. 5 ranking and a 14‚Äì1 record, setting an NCAA record for most wins in a season by Division I football team.Loren Jorgensen, \\"1996 Cotton Bowl: BYU 19, Kansas State 15 -- Cougars cotton to historic 14th win\\" Deseret News 1997-01-02 Sarkisian finished the season with a quarterback rating of 162.0, the third highest in the country. During his 27 years with BYU, the Cougars had a record of 244‚Äì91‚Äì3. When LaVell Edwards retired, Chow was passed over as successor and left BYU for NC State. =NC State= In 2000, Chow became the offensive coordinator and quarterback coach at NC State under new head coach Chuck Amato.\\"Amato Names Chow Offensive Coordinator/Quarterback Coach\\" 2000-01-31 Under Chow's tutelage, quarterback Philip Rivers broke seven school passing records and was named ACC Freshman of the Year.

When Lane Kiffin took over as head coach of the USC Trojans in early 2010, he attempted to hire Chow away from UCLA, but Chow elected to stay after being assured he would receive a contract extension. However, the Bruins' 2010 season proved to be an offensive disappointment: UCLA finished ranked 116th out of 120 teams nationally in passing yardage and 118th in passing efficiency, as they tried to install a pistol offense; in his three seasons, the team had a 15‚Äì22 record. On January 22, 2011, Chow departed UCLA after negotiating a buyout to the contract extension that would have paid him $1 million over the next two seasons rather than remain at UCLA and be demoted to a lesser coaching position.Chris Foster, UCLA fires Norm Chow, hires Mike Johnson, Los Angeles Times, January 22, 2011, Accessed January 23, 2011. While Chow made his reputation by developing quarterbacks, Ramona Shelburne of ESPNLosAngeles.com said he never really had one to develop at UCLA due to injuries to their quarterbacks. =Utah= Chow was immediately hired as the offensive coordinator of the Utah Utes, a team that was getting ready to enter its first season in the Pac-12. \\"Rick [Neuheisel] did a nice job with [facilitating his exit at UCLA]. And [Utah] is a good football situation,\\" said Chow. \\"I went to school there, you know? I have two degrees from there. I met my wife there, my kids were born in Salt Lake. Not many people can say they get to go full circle like that.\\" =Hawaii= On December 21, 2011 Chow was named head coach of the University of Hawaii. Chow began his first season as head coach of Hawaii in 2012 and posted a 3‚Äì9 record. In his second year, Hawaii finished 1‚Äì11, losing five games by a touchdown or less including two in overtime. In response to speculation about his job security, Hawaii's administration expressed confidence in Chow.http://www.staradvertiser.com/sportspremium/20131130__0for_cryin_out_loud.html?id=233903251&c;=n Through two seasons, Chow is one of only two Hawaii coaches (along with Fred von Appen) to begin his tenure with losing seasons since the school attained Division 1 status.

Elyne Mitchell was a keen skier and horsewoman - in 1938 she won the Canadian downhill skiing championship, and according to Tom Wright, in 1941 she became the first woman to descend on skis the entire western face of the Snowy Mountains. During World War II Thomas enlisted in the 2nd A.I.F. and was posted to the 8th Division in Singapore where he was captured by the Japanese. Elyne ran the property by herself until her husband's return at the end of the war. Writing Her novels describe eastern Australian terrain and wildlife in considerable detail. She was part of a wave of nationalist Australian writing that gathered strength in the late 1930s and 1940s and her work is generally described as having a landscape aesthetic. Although the horses and other animals in her books speak to each other, they are not anthropomorphic and particularly in the first two Silver Brumby books, otherwise behave naturally. According to an interview with Tom Wright, the \\"Silver Brumby\\" series arose from Mrs Mitchell's difficulties in finding suitable reading material for her daughter Indi, then 10 and being raised in some isolation on the Mitchell family property Towong Hill, a remote cattle station in the Snowy Mountains. Set in the Snowy Mountains area of the Australian Alps around Mount Kosciuszko in southern New South Wales and northern Victoria, the Snowy Brumby books recount the life of the pale palomino brumby stallion Thowra from his birth in The Silver Brumby (first published 1958) to Silver Brumby Whirlwind. The Silver Brumby was the basis of a film of the same name in 1993 starring Caroline Goodall as Mitchell and Russell Crowe as The Man. This film was also released under the title The Silver Stallion: King of the Wild Brumbies. There is also a children's cartoon TV series of the same name, which uses some character names, but at best is only a very loose adaptation of the books. Elyne Mitchell's other works of fiction are also set in the Snowy Mountains around Thredbo and the Cascade Hut and are populated by brumbies and other animals, native and feral. The brumby stories generally intersect geographically or thematically with the Silver Brumby books and various characters from the Silver Brumby books may appear in the others. She often illustrated her work with her own photographs. Awards and Honours Elyne Mitchell was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for services to literature in 1990. In 1993, Charles Sturt University awarded her an Honorary Doctorate of Letters. She also won Children's Book Council awards: The Silver Brumby was highly commended in the 1959 Book of the Year, Silver Brumby's Daughter was commended in 1961 and Winged Skis was highly commended in 1965. Mitchell used several typewriters, including a 1936 Corona which can be seen at the National Museum of Australia in Canberra.Elyne Mitchell's typewriter, National Museum of Australia The Corryong Library in North East Victoria was renamed in Elyne Mitchell's honour in 2001 and a rural women's literary award (with prizes totalling $2000) has been named after her.Elyne Mitchell Rural Women's Writing Award BibliographyFiction= *Flow River, Blow Wind (1953) *Black Cockatoos Mean Snow (1956) *The Silver Brumby (1958) *Silver Brumby's Daughter (1960) *Kingfisher Feather (1962) *Winged Skis (1964) *Silver Brumbies of the South (1965) *Silver Brumby Kingdom (1966) *Moon Filly (1968) *Jinki: Dingo of the Snows (1970) *Light Horse to Damascus (1971) *Silver Brumby Whirlwind (1973) *The Colt at Taparoo (1973) *Son of the Whirlwind (1979) *The Colt from Snowy River (1980) *Snowy River Brumby (1980) *Brumby Racer (1981) *The Man from Snowy River (1982) (novelization of the screenplay of the film, based on the poem by Banjo Paterson) *The Lighthorsemen (1987) (novelization of the screenplay of the film) *Silver Brumby, Silver Dingo (1993) *Dancing Brumby (1995) *Brumby Stories (1995) *Brumbies of the Night (1996) *Dancing Brumby's Rainbow (1998) *The Thousandth Brumby (1999) *Wild Echoes Ringing (2003) =Nonfiction= *Australia's Alps (1942) *Speak to the Earth (1945) *Soil and Civilization (1946) *Images in Water (1947) *Australian Treescapes: A photographic study (1960) (photographs by Harold Cazneaux et al.) *Light Horse: The Story of Australia's Mounted Troops (1978) *Chauvel Country - The story of a great Australian pioneering family (1983) * Discoverers of the Snowy Mountains (1985) *Vision of the Snowy Mountains (1988) *Towong Hill: Fifty Years on an Upper Murray Cattle Station (1989) External links *A fansite *Elyne Mitchell's typewriter, National Museum of Australia * * The Woman from Snowy River http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/the-woman-from-snowy- river-20121213-2bas0.html References Category:1913 births Category:2002 deaths Category:Australian children's writers Category:Recipients of the Medal of the Order of Australia Category:People from Melbourne Category:Australian women children's writers ","title":"Elyne Mitchell"},{"id":"2730806","text":"SnowCastle in 2006 Snow Restaurant The SnowCastle of Kemi is the biggest snow fort in the world.

Launch and beginnings Sky3 logo used from 2008‚Äì11 The channel was originally launched in 2005 as Sky Three. It was essentially a barker channel for Sky's main entertainment channel Sky One and its other subscription services, which served to \\"offer digital terrestrial viewers the opportunity to enjoy a wide variety of popular programmes from Sky\\".Plunkett, John. \\"Sky Three to launch on Freeview\\", MediaGuardian, 22 September 2005. Retrieved 31 March 2010. From its launch on 1 November 2005 until 24 June 2010, the channel carried Sky Travel's commercial presentations selling holiday deals for a number of providers. Early highlights from the channel's schedule included Futurama, Cold Case, Tru Calling, Relic Hunter, Road Wars, the Inside strand of documentaries, Brainiac: Science Abuse, Airline, and 35mm from Sky Movies (which looks at upcoming films in the cinema and on Sky's premium movies service Sky Movies) and Dream Team. The channel has also shown the free-to-air premieres of some of Sky One's more prestigious shows such as series 3 and 4 of 24, Rescue Me, The 10th Kingdom, Hex and the latest remake of Battlestar Galactica. The channel also showed seasons 3 and 4 of Prison Break in 2010. In recent years, the number of well known Sky One shows being shown on Pick TV has declined. The channel is well known for airing repeats of Road Wars and Airline whilst other shows such as Coach Trip and It's Me or the Dog are also shown regularly, the closure of Sky Real Lives responsible for the increase in lifestyle programming. The number of American shows airing on the channel has declined rapidly, with Prison Break the last major US Sky One drama to be shown on the channel in 2010. Since its rebrand to Pick TV in February 2011, recent Sky One shows such as UK Border Force, Pineapple Dance Studios and documentary series hosted by Ross Kemp such as On Gangs and In Search of Pirates. In recent years, Sky has spent more on the channel, with an increased focus on airing Sky One and Sky Living programmes 12‚Äì18 months after their original broadcasts, and content tailored towards Pick. Such programmes included Z Nation and Monkey Life. On 1 February 2011, Sky Atlantic launched on Sky channel 108, which had originally been occupied by Sky 3. Sky rebranded Sky 3 as Pick TV on 28 February 2011. On Monday 7 October 2013, Pick TV became Pick introducing a new look and logo for the channel. On 28 June 2016, another new logo was announced which also included a brand new look. In May 2012, Pick TV started broadcasting some older Sky One and Sky Living shows, and the former Channel One and Bravo shows. Freeview and rebrands Sky Three was the first free-to-air general entertainment channel from Sky. It launched on 1 November 2005, replacing the Sky Travel's EPG slot on Freeview in a bid to attract more subscribers to Sky's satellite service. Due to its wider availability on Freeview channel 11, the channel constantly had higher ratings than Sky Two where Sky Three was achieving on average a 1% share compared to Sky Two's 0.1‚Äì3% share. Instead of Sky selling on the terrestrial free-to-air rights for their programmes to another broadcaster, these rights are usually retained to remain exclusive to Sky. In 2008, Sky's entertainment channels changed the wording in the logos to numbers, hence Sky Three became Sky 3. On 23 August 2010, Sky Sports News became a pay-TV channel, which was replaced on Freeview by a one-hour timeshift version of Sky 3. Sky 3 +1 also launched on Sky channel 223 on the same day. A final rebrand took place in early 2011 and saw Sky 1, 2 and 3 gain similar rectangular logos to Sky News and Sky Sports. The channel was rebranded as Pick TV (and Pick TV +1) on 28 February 2011. Only the name was changed, as the channel retained the look of the most recent rebrand which occurred a few weeks earlier. Sky's acquisition of Challenge saw quiz and gameshow type programming move off Pick TV. On 20 September 2011 at 14:00, Pick TV +1 was removed from Freeview.This was so that all of the channels owned by BSkyB could be on multiplex C and Challenge could broadcast for 24 hours a day in Wales on the platform, in-line with the rest of the UK. On 1 March 2018, Pick +1 was added back on Freeview as a FreeviewHD service. A while later the channel moved from channel 97 to 92 on Freeview. On 7 October 2013, Pick TV was rebranded as Pick on all platforms. On 23 June 2016, Pick and Challenge were rebranded with entirely new looks. Since its rebrand to Pick, it is fairly common for Pick and Challenge to cross-promote its programmes to viewers. These include regular trailers inbetween shows, and when a certain show finishes, the continuity announcer will usually tell viewers what is coming up next on both channels. On 18 June 2020, Pick +1 was removed from Freeview channel 92. On 17 September 2020, Pick moved from channel 11 on Freeview to channel 34 to make way for Sky Arts which moved to Freeview. This caused Merit to closedown after 50 days. Special programmingSky Thursdays= Pick TV showcased some of Sky's premium entertainment content once a week from 24 January 2013 for 12 weeks. 'Sky Thursdays' was a branded segment that offered selected episodes of some of Sky's most popular programmes, usually only available on its pay TV channels. Sky Thursdays kicked off on 24 January 2013 with the first episode of comedy series Modern Family at 7pm. Sky's recent documentary on cyclist Bradley Wiggins was shown at 7:30pm. Elementary followed at 9pm and the evening ended with the first episode of Sky Atlantic's Game of Thrones at 10pm. During subsequent weeks, selected episodes of shows like Boardwalk Empire, An Idiot Abroad, Michael Parkinson's Masterclass and Mad Dogs were shown. Excluding An Idiot Abroad and Elementary, there is no indication that the full set of episodes for any of these programmes will air on Pick TV. =Sky News on Pick= A 60-second bespoke news bulletin from Sky News was introduced on 26 November 2012 and is broadcast nightly at 21:00. =Premier League= Between June and July 2020, Pick broadcast 25 of the remaining 92 Premier League games, simulcast on Sky Sports, which were played behind closed doors as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. To coincide with this, a temporary high- definition simulcast of Pick launched on Sky, Virgin Media and Freesat in the United Kingdom on 16 June 2020. The HD simulcast ceased broadcasting on 4 August 2020.

He commenced a movement to reintroduce monasticism into the Church of England. Early life Lyne was born in Trinity Square, in the parish of All Hallows-by-the- Tower, London, on 23 November 1837. He was the second son of seven children of Francis Lyne, merchant of the City of London, by his wife Louisa Genevieve (d. 1877), daughter of George Hanmer Leycester, of White Place, near Maidenhead, Berkshire, who came of the well-known Cheshire family, the Leycesters of Tabley. In October 1847 Lyne entered St Paul's School, London, under Herbert Kynaston. In 1852 he suffered corporal punishment for a breach of discipline. His biographer, Baroness Beatrice de Bertouch, four years before his death, described it as the event, \\"which not only endangered his life\\" but also \\"was the cause of a distressing condition of nerve collapse, the effects of which he feels to this day\\". Bertouch saw it as \\"the culminating link in a heavy chain of influences, and one which was destined to throw a strange psychological glamour over the entire atmosphere of this devotional and emotional career.\\" He was removed, and his education was completed at private schools in Spalding and Worcester. He early developed advanced views of sacramental doctrine. Ignatius of Llanthony Ministry Portrait of Father Ignatius c.1865 An acquaintance with Bishop Robert Eden procured Lyne's admission to Trinity College, Glenalmond. There he studied theology under William Bright, and impressed the warden, John Hannah, by his earnest piety. After a year's lay work as catechist in Inverness, where his eccentricity and impatience of discipline brought him into collision with Bishop Eden, Lyne was ordained into the diaconate in 1860, on the express condition that he should remain a deacon and abstain from preaching for three years. He became curate to George Rundle Prynne, vicar of St Peter's, Plymouth, and soon started a guild for men and boys, called the Society of the Love of Jesus, with himself as superior. Prynne, to Lyne's mother, wrote: \\"He was animated by a very true spirit of devotion in carrying out such work as was assigned to him; and his earnest and loving character largely won the affections of those among whom he ministered.\\" In Plymouth, Lyne formed two friendships which were very important in his future career; these two friends were Edward Bouverie Pusey and Priscilla Lydia Sellon. According to Bertouch, these two were \\"the ghostly foster-parents of the monk's vocation, or at any rate of its consummation\\". Almost up to his death, Pusey was the chosen administrator of the Sacrament of Penance to Ignatius. Pusey was his \\"friend, his confidant, his arbitrator in all situations difficult.\\" This Society grew to about forty members. Lyne went to Pusey and Sellon for advice about it. Sellon, with Pusey's encouragement, loaned him a house to begin his community life on a monastic pattern. He was encouraged by Sellon, and largely influenced by Pusey, who presented him with his first monastic habit. With two Brothers, he took possession of this house, but the existence of the community was cut short by Lyne's serious illness. In Bruges, Belgium, where he went to convalesce, he studied the Rule of Saint Benedict. On his return in 1861 he replaced Alexander Heriot Mackonochie as curate of St George in the East, London, and took charge of St. Saviour's mission church. Now convinced of his monastic vocation, he assumed the Benedictine religious habit. The innovation was challenged by Charles Lowder, founder of the Society of the Holy Cross, his ritualist vicar, and after nine months Lyne resigned rather than abandon his monastic dress. In 1862 Lyne, who henceforth called himself Father Ignatius, issued a pamphlet in favour of the revival of monasticism in the Church of England. This publication excited vehement controversy. Together with one or two kindred spirits Lyne formed in Claydon, Suffolk, a community, which was frequently menaced by Protestant violence. His reasons were strong and clear. > Souls are perishing by thousands close to our doors. The Church of England, > as she is at present, is wholly unable to grapple with the task. . . . > Communities of men‚Äîcall them colleges, monasteries, or whatever you > please‚Äîappear to be the most suitable for the object in view. These men > should be unmarried and altogether unshackled by earthly cares and domestic > ties. Such establishments must be governed by rule. The rule of St. Benedict > has received universal sanction, and the veneration of thirteen centuries. > It is suitable in almost every way for all ages and times, and is consistent > with the most faithful loyalty to the English Church. The specific objectives of this order were: #The restoration of the ascetic life and continual prayer in the Church of England; #home mission work, by preaching, visiting the poor, and teaching the young; #to afford a temporary religious retreat for the secular clergy; #to raise the tone of devotion in the English Church to a higher standard by showing the real exemplification of the evangelical counsels; #to aid in bringing about the union of Christendom. There were three orders within the Community. The First Order, to whom the above objects apply, observed the Rule of St. Benedict in its integrity. The novitiate lasted, first for six months, then for four, then for two, then for the year, until the novice was considered really called by God to take the life vows. The Second Order consisted of men and women living in the world, and yet leading in their own homes a strictly religious life, using a prescribed dress, reciting the canonical day hours according to the Benedictine Use, and also observing the five rules of the Third Order. This Third Order consisted of men, women and children bound by solemn promise to obey five definite rules regulating: #Their attendance at the holy mysteries of the Church; #Self-examination; #The use of a prayer on behalf of the Society; #The giving of alms; and #Obedience to the Superior. The Bishop of Norwich, John Pelham, refused him a licence to preach and subsequently inhibited him. In 1863 Lyne acquired premises on Elm Hill, Norwich, in face of local opposition. Special masses were celebrated for the community by the sympathetic vicar in St Laurence's Church, Norwich, at Lyne's instigation, produced further conflicts between him and the bishop. Lyne's appeal for support to Bishop Samuel Wilberforce only elicited a recommendation of submission. Forcing himself upon public notice by addressing the Bristol Church Congress of 1863, he could only secure a hearing through the interposition of Bishop Charles Ellicott. His life in Norwich was varied by a mission to London and by quarrels within the community. In 1866, owing to a flaw in the title-deeds, Lyne found himself dispossessed of his Elm Hill property, and he moved to a house in Chale, Isle of Wight, lent him by Pusey. In 1867 he moved to Laleham and in Feltham nearby he started anonther Anglican religious order, a Benedictine enclosed convent for women, who subsequently entered into full communion with the Roman Catholic Church. From 1866 to 1868 he preached regularly at St Bartholomew's Moor Lane Church and other London churches. His conduct was so extravagant, however, that he was suspended, from officiating or preaching in the Diocese of London, by Bishop Archibald Tait; \\"owing in part to the action taken by in respect to a lady whom he proposed to 'solemnly excommunicate from our Holy Congregation'.\\" In 1869 Lyne purchased land near Capel-y-ffin in the Black Mountains, Wales, and built Llanthony Abbey, four miles further up the valley from Llanthony Priory. The cost of the building, which remained incomplete, was defrayed by friends and the pecuniary returns of Lyne's mission preaching. Accounts of miracles and supernatural visitations enhanced the local prestige of the monastery, of which Ignatius constituted himself abbot. But the life of the community never ran smoothly. Few joined the order; in many cases those who joined soon fell away. In 1873 Lyne was summoned before Vice-chancellor Sir Richard Malins for detaining Richard Alfred J Todd, a ward in chancery, as a novice at Llanthony, and was ordered to release the young man. His difficulties were increased by family quarrels. His father, who had persistently opposed his son's extreme Anglican practices, repudiated him altogether after his mother's death in 1877, and publicly denounced his conduct and doctrines. Ignatius combined the profession of a cloistered monk with the activities of a wandering friar. When the churches were closed to him, he appeared in lecture halls and theatres, and impressed the public everywhere by his eloquence. On 12 December 1872 he appeared as the champion of Christianity in an interesting public encounter with Charles Bradlaugh, founder of the National Secular Society, in the Hall of Science in Old Street, London. From 1890 to 1891, he made a missionary tour through Canada and the United States where he was cordially invited to preach in the churches of many denominations; but his zeal for heresy-hunting was not appreciated by the Episcopal Church of America. On his return he initiated a petition to the archbishops and convocation for measures against historical criticism of the scriptures; and at the Birmingham Church Congress of 1893 he denounced future Bishop of Oxford Charles Gore for his 1890 essay \\"The Holy Spirit and inspiration\\" in Lux Mundi. On 27 July 1898, Lyne, an ordained deacon in the Church of England but \\"unable to receive orders in his own church\\" for over three decades, was ordained priest by Joseph Ren√© Vilatte. Rene Kollar wrote, in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, that \\"for a time\\" Lyne \\"dreamed of establishing a British Old Catholic church.\\" Years earlier, in 1890‚Äì1891, while Lyne was on his tour of North America raising funds for his work in England, The Cambrian wrote that his order \\"is not a Catholic Order, nor a Church of England exactly, but an offshoot of the High Church movement associated with the idea of a revival of the [a]ncient British Church\\"‚Äîwhich Joanne Pearson in Wicca and the Christian Heritage, calls a \\"literary fantasm\\" ‚Äîand his abbey church conducts some services in Welsh. The Cambrian noted that had Lyne addressed the 1889 National Eisteddfod of Wales, in Brecon, on behalf of the Welsh language and of the Ancient British Church and also admitted a Druid, taking the bardic name Dewi Honddu, by the Archdruid Clwydfardd; and had spoken for the rights of the Ancient Welsh Church at the English Church Congress held at Cardiff, by the permission of the Bishop of Llandaff. Pearson argues that \\"concern with ancient, indigenous religions emerging and operating independently of the Church of Rome characterises the heterodox Christian churches of the in England, Wales and France\\" and \\"was a theme that was to influence the development of Druidry and Wicca.\\" She believes, based on accounts published during his tour of him being the \\"Druid of the Welsh Church\\" and \\"belonging to an Ancient British Church, older than any except Antioch and Jerusalem\\", Lyne may have been part of another , Richard Williams Morgan, recreated Ancient British Church, given its overtones of Welsh nationalism and links to neo-druidism.It was, according to Desmond Morse-Boycott, in Lead, Kindly Light, his accepting ordination \\"at the hands of a wandering (Old Catholic) bishop, who was an adventurer\\" that discredited him with the Church of England which \\"denied him the priesthood\\". De Bertouch wrote that Vilatte also consecrated Ignatius as a mitred Abbot, but whether this is so is not clear. In Catholic practice the conferring of abbatial status is closely analogous to the consecration of a bishop ‚Äì in that both procedures involve conferring a mitre and crozier on the cleric concerned ‚Äì and therefore the term \\"consecration\\" does not imply anything other than a kind of formal induction to an abbatial post. Suggestions that Vilatte went even further and consecrated Ignatius a bishop have been discounted by Peter Anson a leading authority on episcopi vagantes, who says that Vilatte did nothing other than ordain Ignatius to the priesthood, making it clear that Ignatius refused to consider being raised to the episcopate, even though it is equally certain that Vilatte did offer to consecrate him.Anson, P.F, 1964. Bishops at Large, London, Faber and Faber Anson, who was at one time a monk under Aelred Carlyle at Caldey, wrote extensively on the Llanthony and Caldey Anglican monastic experiments, and describes the Baroness de Bertouch's hagiographic book (for which Ignatius himself furnished much information) as being one that \\"reads like fiction\\").Anson, P.F, 1973. Building Up the Waste Places ‚Äì The revival of monastic life in the Church of England, London, Faith Press. According to Kollar, Ignatius eventually also became a Zionist, British Israelite, and a believer in the flat earth theory. Contemporary description Lyne was heavily ridiculed by many of his contemporaries, though the Anglican diarist Francis Kilvert described him in his 2 September 1870 diary entry about Kilvert's visit to the Chapel House farm: But Kilvert also described in his 15 July 1870 diary entry that Lyne's' brother, Clavering Lyne, told him about \\"some of the extraordinary visions which had appeared to Ignatius, particularly about the ghosts which come crowding round him and which will never answer though he often speaks to them. Also about the fire in the monastery chapel at Norwich, that strange unearthly fire which Father Ignatius put out by throwing himself into it and making the sign of the cross.\\" Controversies David Hilliard wrote in Victorian Studies that an \\"Anglo-Catholic underworld\\" produced groups \\"whose members delighted in religious ceremonial and the picturesque neo-Gothic externals of monastic life.\\" Hilliard wrote that those groups did not enforce strict criteria for entry and \\"it is likely that they were especially attractive to homosexually inclined young men who felt themselves drawn to the male environment of a monastic community and the dramatic side of religion.\\" An example cited by Hilliard was an incident, published on 17 September 1864 in the Norfolk News, that occurred at Elm Hill Priory in which a monk, Brother Augustine, wrote a love letter to a boy, an apprentice printer, who sang in the choir. The allegations horrified Norwich. The newspaper included the following passage in an editorial about the situation published a week later: A year later the community at Elm Hill Priory was almost destroyed when James Barrett Hughes, known as Brother Stanislaus, rebelled against Lyne's authority, then fled with a boy, Francis George Nobbs, who eventually became known as ex-monk Widdows, from the Guild of St William. In 1868 Hughes became a popular guest speaker at Protestant platforms in London and other places, where he scandalised his audiences with revelations of the \\"semi-Popish and improper practices\\" of Ignatius and other ritualists. The Saturday Review published an account of one such meeting that was held in London, noted inconsistencies in his story, called Hughes a novice \\"in the art of reasoning\\", and congratulated \\"the devotees of Exeter Hall on having found an orator so entirely worthy of them as the converted novice, Mr James Barrett Hughes; and Father Ignatius on having got rid of a monk and created an enemy, who seems to be even madder than himself.\\" At a different meeting in London, two Norwich youths \\"made frightful charges, utterly unfit for publication, against a monk\\" which Hilliard wrote were a reference to Brother Augustine. Another case was revealed on 18 February 1869, in the Marylebone Police Court, while both men were summoned, on charges of drunkenness and disorder in the public street, the magistrate gathered that both lived some six years back at the Elm Hill Priory and had a sexual relationship. Hughes was in charge of St. William's Guild, of which Nobbs was a member. Bertouch wrote that Nobbs \\"was reported to have affirmed that not only had the Superior been aware of their degeneracy, but that he had condoned and encouraged it, by performing on their behalf, and in his own church, a ceremony which in itself was blasphemy and sacrilege of the most revolting kind.\\" Bertouch also wrote: \\"This was the digest of the accusation, and it needed no more to set the Protestant world ablaze with joy and expectation.\\" Death, and the fate of the Abbey Joseph Leycester Lyne died in Camberley on 16 October 1908, and was buried in Llanthony Abbey. The abbey was left to the few remaining monks, subject to the right of an adopted son, William Leycester Lyne; in 1911 it passed into the hands of the Anglican Benedictine community of Caldey Island. At one point, an Anglican priest, one Father Richard Courtier-Forster was appointed to succeed Ignatius as Abbot, but following the ordination of Ignatius' designated Prior Asaph Harris by Vilatte, the Abbot-designate resigned and all real hope of regularising the Llanthony Benedictines as an Anglican foundation ended.Calder-Marshall, A, 2000, The Enthusiast: An Enquiry into the Life Beliefs and Character of the Rev.

The monastery has a later religious association in that it was, for two years or so, the home of the controversial Carmelite friar and writer Father Brocard Sewell, who withdrew there after he had written to The Times questioning Catholic teaching on birth control and criticising the encyclical Humanae Vitae; as things turned out, no sanction was ever imposed on Fr Sewell either by the Prior Provincial of his Order or the local bishop. Sewell considered his stance a matter of conscience and subsequently published a book \\"The Vatican Oracle\\" (1970) detailing his views.Sewell, B, 1987, Frances Horovitz, a Symposium, Aylesford, Aylesford Press ‚Äì includes an account of Fr Sewell's time at Capel- y-ffin. Fr Ignatius's abbey church, which was never completed, fell into disrepair before the Gill family arrivedGill, E. 1941, Autobiography, London, Cape. and the roof was removed during the 1930s. In 1967 responsibility for its upkeep was transferred to a new ecumenical body, the Father Ignatius Memorial Trust, of which Fr Brocard Sewell was a founder member. Extensive restoration work was subsequently carried out on both the surviving abbey walls and Ignatius's grave within. As the structure was fundamentally unsound, this work has been only partially successful, and at the time of writing (April 2018) public access is denied. The Father Ignatius Memorial Trust also cares for the statue of the Blessed Virgin commemorating her alleged apparitions at the monastery in August and September 1880, as well as the memorial Calvary opposite the site of the related ‚Äòholy bush‚Äô. A considerable collection of archives and artefacts has been assembled under the auspices of the Trust, most of which is housed at the Abergavenny Museum; the tabernacle which formerly stood on the high altar of the abbey church and various pictures are cared for by the present owners of the monastery but are not normally on view. Ignatius's effort to revive monasticism in England bore little fruit. His persuasive oratory and his courage in the face of persecution were combined with extravagance of conduct and an impatience of authority which rendered him unable to work even with sympathisers. The Order of St. Benedict founded by Ignatius was not a revival of the Rule of Saint Benedict; Ignatius was independent and erratic, his rules were eclectic.

The River Wye, the A470 and the A44 trunk roads pass through Llangurig, as do the National Cycle Route 8 and the Wye Valley Walk. The 15th century parish church located in the village is dedicated to Saint Curig, its reputed founder, and is a grade II* listed building. There are also two small chapels.

'The Railway that never was' During the Victorian era, Llangurig nearly had a railway service. The Llangurig branch is noted as being the shortest lived working branch line in the UK, receiving only one train. Wales' rail network was built piecemeal by many small companies, and Parliament mistakenly granted acts for two lines through the same piece of terrain, linking Llanidloes to Aberystwyth: one for the Manchester and Milford Railway; the other for the Mid-Wales Railway. The M&MR; intended to connect the two settlements with a route across Wales, to enable the industrialised Northwest to access the deep-water port in Milford Haven, West Wales. The MWR was authorized to build its line by act of parliament in 1859.Holden, J.S.The Manchester & Milford Railway. The Oakwood Press, Second Edition, 2007, Ch 1-4. The M&M; was likewise authorized in 1860. The line was to head west from Llanidloes by way of Llangurig to Pant Mawr, through a tunnel, turning southwards for Ysbyty Ystwyth and Tregaron, finally connecting with the Carmarthen & Cardigan Railway at Pencader. After resolving difficulties of accessing Llanidloes through the creation of the joint Llanidloes and Newtown Railway, it would extend of double track southwards to Penpontbren, where the MWR and M&MR; would diverge. The M&MR; and MWR were to pay 5% per annum on construction costs and maintenance. Also the three companies were to pay equal shares of interest and running costs for the new station at Llanidloes. These charges were eventually to prove crippling for the M&MR.; The Llangurig branch line as built The Llangurig branch was fully built, and a single goods train ran along its length, at which point the L&NR; invoiced the M&MR; for the cost of the joint station at Llanidloes. The branch service was immediately terminated, being wholly unprofitable without through traffic. The M&MR; continued to pay for the cost of the joint station they could not reach. By 1864 the M&MR; had changed its plans for crossing the Pumlumon range, and hence stopped all work west of Llangurig. 1866 was a difficult year, including the collapse of the London Bank Overend, Gurney and Company, causing many industrial projects to encounter financial hardship. By 1876 MWR had still failed to build the new route, with an act of parliament permitting abandonment of the scheme. In 1882 the M&MHR; started to dismantle the Llangurig branch, lifting of the essentially unused track for maintenance purposes elsewhere. A large part of the route east of Llangurig is marked on current OS maps as 'dismantled railway', much of the course close to the A470 road through Nant Gwynwydd being clearly visible.

Set in northeastern England shortly after the Battle of Britain (February 1941), it features children who find a crashed German aircraft with a machine gun and ammunition; they build a fortress and capture and imprison a German gunner. The author also wrote a play based on the book, and others have adapted it for television and radio. A sequel, Fathom Five, set two years later, was published in 1979. Westall won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's outstanding children's book by a British subject, and Machine Gunners was named one of the top ten Medal-winning works for the 70th anniversary celebration in 2007, selected by a panel to compose the ballot for a public election of the all-time favourite. Plot summary Set during the Second World War the story follows six children living in the fictional town of Garmouth which regularly suffers bombing raids by the German Luftwaffe. When Chas McGill finds a crashed German Heinkel 111 bomber he removes a fully operational machine gun and over 2000 rounds of ammunition. With the help of his friends, Cem, Clogger, Carrot Juice, Audrey and Nicky they set up their own den called \\"Fortress Caporetto\\", named after a World War I battle in which Chas's grandfather fought. Later a bomb lands on Nicky's house and he is presumed dead but actually survives and hides in the fortress, where he is found by the gang. After this, only his friends know he is alive and Clogger leaves his home and joins him. During an attack by a Bf 110 fighter, the children fire their gun at the plane. They miss but the plane is shot down. The pilot is killed but the rear gunner, Rudi Gerlath, bails out. He discovers the children's hidden fortress and is promptly detained by the children, who take his pistol, even though their machine gun is damaged and inoperable. The children do not hand the German over to the authorities, but keep him prisoner at their fort. The children bribe the German with the offer of a boat if he will repair their machine gun. He agrees and mends it before being taken to the dock where he rows off. The same night the church bells ring signalling a German invasion. The children hurry to the fortress but do not see anything; it was a false alarm. Out at sea, Rudi finds he does not have the strength to row to German-occupied Norway and is forced back to England and rejoins the children at the fortress. The next day it is realised that the children are missing, and some Polish soldiers are drafted in to look for them. The children, on hearing troops speak in a foreign language, open fire on them with the gun, believing they are a German invasion force. The children are soon overpowered, however, and forced to surrender. In the chaos, Clogger shoots and wounds Rudi with his own Luger pistol. The very well-made fortress is surrendered to the Home Guard, then Clogger and Nicky are taken to a children's home while the other children are handed over to their parents.

Agents that are represented graphically with a body, for example a human or a cartoon animal, are also called embodied agents, although they have only virtual, not physical, embodiment. A branch of artificial intelligence focuses on empowering such agents to interact autonomously with human beings and the environment. Mobile robots are one example of physically embodied agents; Ananova and Microsoft Agent are examples of graphically embodied agents. Embodied conversational agents are embodied agents (usually with a graphical front-end as opposed to a robotic body) that are capable of engaging in conversation with one another and with humans employing the same verbal and nonverbal means that humans do (such as gesture, facial expression, and so forth). Embodied conversational agents A 2011 image of an automated online assistant providing customer service on a web page - an example of an embodied conversational agent. Embodied conversational agents are a form of intelligent user interface. Graphically embodied agents aim to unite gesture, facial expression and speech to enable face-to-face communication with users, providing a powerful means of human-computer interaction. Advantages Face- to-face communication allows communication protocols that give a much richer communication channel than other means of communicating. It enables pragmatic communication acts such as conversational turn-taking, facial expression of emotions, information structure and emphasis, visualisation and iconic gestures, and orientation in a three-dimensional environment. This communication takes place through both verbal and non-verbal channels such as gaze, gesture, spoken intonation and body posture. Research has found that users prefer a non-verbal visual indication of an embodied system's internal state to a verbal indication, demonstrating the value of additional non-verbal communication channels. As well as this, the face-to-face communication involved in interacting with an embodied agent can be conducted alongside another task without distracting the human participants, instead improving the enjoyment of such an interaction. Furthermore, the use of an embodied presentation agent results in improved recall of the presented information. Embodied agents also provide a social dimension to the interaction. Humans willingly ascribe social awareness to computers, and thus interaction with embodied agents follows social conventions, similar to human to human interactions. This social interaction both raises the believability and perceived trustworthiness of agents, and increases the user's engagement with the system. Rickenberg and Reeves found that the presence of an embodied agent on a website increased the level of user trust in that website, but also increased users' anxiety and affected their performance, as if they were being watched by a real human. Another effect of the social aspect of agents is that presentations given by an embodied agent are perceived as being more entertaining and less difficult than similar presentations given without an agent. Research shows that perceived enjoyment, followed by perceived usefulness and ease of use, is the major factor influencing user adoption of embodied agents. A study in January 2004 by Byron Reeves at Stanford demonstrated how digital characters could \\"enhance online experiences\\" through explaining how virtual characters essentially add a sense of relatability to the user experience and make it more approachable. This increase in likability in turn helps make the products better, which benefits both the end users and those creating the product. =Applications= Sgt. Star, the U.S. Army's online assistant. The rich style of communication that characterises human conversation makes conversational interaction with embodied conversational agents ideal for many non-traditional interaction tasks. A familiar application of graphically embodied agents is computer games; embodied agents are ideal for this setting because the richer communication style makes interacting with the agent enjoyable. Embodied conversational agents have also been used in virtual training environments, portable personal navigation guides, interactive fiction and storytelling systems, interactive online characters and automated presenters and commentators. Major virtual assistants like Siri and Google Assistant do not come with any visual embodied representation, which is believed to limit the sense of human presence by users.

It is headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands, with a branch office in Dubai, UAE.Contact Information. RIPE NCC. Retrieved on 10 February 2009. A RIR oversees the allocation and registration of Internet number resources (IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses and autonomous system numbers) in a specific region. The RIPE NCC supports the technical and administrative coordination of the infrastructure of the Internet. It is a not-for-profit membership organisation with over 10,000 (as of March 2014) members located in over 76 countries in its service region.http://www.ripe.net/membership/maps/index.html Any individual or organisation can become a member of the RIPE NCC. The membership consists mainly of Internet service providers (ISPs), telecommunication organisations, educational institutions, governments, regulatory agencies, and large corporations. The RIPE NCC also provides technical and administrative support to R√©seaux IP Europ√©ens (RIPE), a forum open to all parties with an interest in the technical development of the Internet. History The RIPE NCC began its operations in April 1992 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Initial funding was provided by the academic networks R√©seaux Associ√©s pour la Recherche Europ√©enne (RARE) members, EARN, and EUnet. The RIPE NCC was formally established when the Dutch version of the Articles of Association was deposited with the Amsterdam Chamber of Commerce on 12 November 1997. The first RIPE NCC Activity Planftp://ftp.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ripe-035.txt was published in May 1991. On 25 November 2019, RIPE NCC announcedThe RIPE NCC has run out of IPv4 Addresses, RIPE NCC, 2019-11-25 that it had made its ‚Äúfinal /22 IPv4 allocation from the last remaining addresses in our available pool. We have now run out of IPv4 addresses.‚Äù RIPE NCC will continue to allocate IPv4 addresses, but only ‚Äúfrom organisations that have gone out of business or are closed, or from networks that return addresses they no longer need. These addresses will be allocated to our members (LIRs) according to their position on a new waiting list ‚Ä¶.‚Äù The announcement also called for support for the implementation of the IPv6 roll-out. Activities The RIPE NCC supports the development of the Internet through technical coordination of the Internet infrastructure in its service region and beyond. It undertakes many activities in this area, including: * Allocation and registration of Internet number resources (IP addresses and autonomous system numbers) :The allocation of IP addresses is important for several reasons. Public addresses need to be unique; if duplicate internet addresses existed on a network, network traffic could be delivered to the wrong host. The RIRs make sure that public addresses are given to one organisation. The RIPE NCC does this for its own service region. Worldwide, IANA assigns blocks of addresses to the RIRs and they distribute these to end users via the LIRs (normally ISPs). Beside making sure that IP addresses and AS Numbers are only allocated to one user, the shortage of IPv4 addresses makes it important that the remaining addresses are allocated in an organised manner. For many years, the RIPE NCC has followed strict guidelines on how to assign IPv4 addresses according to policy developed by the RIPE Community, as outlined in the RIPE Document ripe-498. As the last /8 block has been assigned from IANA to all the RIRs, the RIPE NCC will only have new IPv4 addresses available for allocation for a certain amount of time.https://www.ripe.net/internet- coordination/ipv4-exhaustion/ipv4-available-pool-graph * Development, operation and maintenance of the RIPE Database. * Development, operation and maintenance of the RIPE Routing Registry.http://www.ripe.net/data- tools/db/the-ripe-routing-registry * Operation of K-root, one of the world's root name servers. * Coordination support for ENUM delegations . * Collection and publication of neutral statistics on Internet development and performance, notable via the RIPE Atlas global measurement network and RIPEstat, a web- based interface providing information about IP address space, autonomous system numbers, and related information for hostnames and countries.

Members are responsible for nominating and electing candidates to the RIPE NCC executive board and for accepting the RIPE NCC charging scheme and approving the RIPE NCC financial report each year. Members also give input to, and feedback on, the activities carried out and the services provided by the RIPE NCC. ; Executive board : RIPE NCC members nominate and elect the executive board. The board consists of between three and seven members and is responsible for appointing the RIPE NCC's managing director, for the overall financial situation of the RIPE NCC and for keeping records that allow the financial situation of the organisation to be evaluated at any time. ; RIPE NCC staff : Staff members perform the activities of the RIPE NCC, provide services to its members and provide administrative support to RIPE. The RIPE NCC and RIPE R√©seaux IP Europ√©ens is a forum open to all parties with an interest in the technical development of the Internet. Although similar in name, RIPE and the RIPE NCC are separate entities. However, they are highly interdependent. The RIPE NCC provides administrative support to RIPE, such as the facilitation of RIPE Meetings and giving administrative support to RIPE Working Groups.http://www.ripe.net/ripe/wg/index.html Fees Internet number resources do not have any monetary value. The RIPE NCC charges members an annual membership fee. Since 2012 this fee has been equal for all members and is unrelated to resource holdings. However a separate charge is made for each Provider Independent number resource associated with customers of members. DatabasesThe RIPE Database= The RIPE Database is a public database containing registration details of the IP addresses and AS numbers originally allocated to members by the RIPE NCC. It shows which organisations or individuals currently hold which Internet number resources, when the allocations were made and contact details. The organisations or individuals that hold these resources are responsible for updating information in the database. As of March 2008, the database contents are available for near real- time mirroring (NRTM).RIPE DATABASE Near Real Time Mirroring (NRTM) =RIPE Routing Registry= The RIPE Routing Registry (RR) is a sub-set of the RIPE Database and holds routing information in RPSL.

The plant was built on a of reclaimed land along Gin Drinkers Bay, Kwai Chung, near Pillar Island and the Rambler Channel. The plant was opened in 1978 to process solid waste from Hong Kong to reduce the need to put waste into landfills. History The incinerator was built due to the shortage of land available for conventional landfills in Hong Kong. A contract to build the facility, contested by seven international companies, was awarded to Clarke Chapman-John Thompson of Gateshead, England, and signed on 29 November 1973. An official opening ceremony for the plant was held on 17 October 1978. Unlike older incinerators in Hong Kong, the Kwai Chung plant was fitted with an electrostatic precipitator to reduce the pollution emitted. In addition, the 150-metre-tall chimney at Kwai Chung was taller than those at the Kennedy Town and Lai Chi Kok incinerators, so that pollutants would be dispersed at a higher altitude. Cessation of operation In 1989, the Hong Kong Government issued a white paper, Pollution in Hong Kong - A Time to Act. After considering the effects of air pollution on the environment and public health, it was decided to cease using incineration to dispose of solid waste. This decision was later suspended and, as of 2008, the Hong Kong Government is considering constructing new incinerators.Incinerator The Best Option For Hong Kong Rubbish - Blog entry by Clear the Air, January 2008 In May 1997, the Kwai Chung Incineration Plant ceased to operate, the last of Hong Kong's four plants to do so:FAQ on incineration from the webpage of The Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department * Lai Chi Kok Incineration Plant - commissioned 1969 and decommissioned 1991; now part of the expanded container port area * Kennedy Town Incineration Plant - commissioned 1967 and located next to Island West Transfer Station; decommissioned 1993 and now berthing facility * Mui Wo Incineration Plant - commissioned 1987 and decommissioned 1994; now site of Silvermine Bay Outdoor Recreation Camp Demolition Although the plant ceased operation in 1997, it was not completely demolished.

The film is about Jeremy \\"Powder\\" Reed, who has an incredible intellect, as well as telepathy and paranormal powers. It questions the limits of the human mind and body while also displaying society's capacity for cruelty, and raises hope that humanity will advance to a state of better understanding. Its filming locations were around suburbs of Houston, San Antonio, and Austin, Texas. The film was a financial success, but critical reviews were mixed and the film's release dogged with controversy due to Salva's prior conviction for child sex abuse. Plot Jeremy \\"Powder\\" Reed (Sean Patrick Flanery) is a young albino man who has incredible intellect and is able to sense the thoughts of the people around him. Jeremy's brain possesses a powerful electromagnetic charge, which causes electrical objects to function abnormally when he is around them, particularly when he becomes emotional. The electromagnetic charge also prevents hair from growing on his body. Jeremy's mother was struck by lightning while pregnant with him; she died shortly after the strike, but Jeremy survived. His father disowned him shortly after his premature birth, and he was raised by his grandparents. Jeremy lived in the basement and worked on their farm, never leaving their property and learning everything he knew from books. He is taken from his home when his grandfather is found dead of natural causes. Jessie Caldwell (Mary Steenburgen), a child services psychologist, takes him to a boys' home because he is now effectively a ward of the state. Jessie enrolls him in high school, where Jeremy meets physics teacher Donald Ripley (Jeff Goldblum). Donald finds out that Jeremy has supernatural powers as well as the highest IQ in history. While his abilities mark him as special, they also make him an outcast. On a hunting trip with his schoolmates, Jeremy is threatened with a gun by John Box (Bradford Tatum), an aggressive student who views him as a freak. Before John can fire, a gun goes off in the distance, and everyone rushes to see that Harley Duncan, a Sheriff's deputy, has shot a doe. Anguished by the animal's death, Jeremy touches both the deer and Harley at the same time, inducing in Harley what the students assume is a seizure. Harley later admits that Jeremy had actually caused him to feel the pain and fear of the dying deer. Because of the experience, Harley removes all of his guns from his house, although Sheriff Doug Barnum (Lance Henriksen) allows him to remain as a sheriff's deputy without a sidearm. Doug enlists Jeremy to help speak to his dying wife through telepathy. Through Jeremy, the sheriff learns that his wife clings onto life because she didn't want to die while not wearing her wedding ring and without him reconciling with his estranged son, Steven. She tells him that Steven found the ring and that it has been sitting in a silver box on her nightstand the entire time. Doug then places the ring on his wife's finger and reconciles with Steven, letting his wife die peacefully. Jeremy meets Lindsey Kelloway, a romantic interest, but their relationship is broken by Lindsey's father. Before the interruption, he tells Lindsey that he can see the truth about people: that they are scared and feel disconnected from the rest of the world but in truth are all connected to everything that exists. Jeremy goes back to the juvenile facility and packs away his belongings, planning to run away to his farm. He pauses in the gym to stare at a male student washing, noticing the latter's luxurious head of hair as well as body hair which he himself lacks, and is caught at it by John Box, who accuses him of homosexuality. John steals Jeremy's hat and taunts him, but Jeremy reveals that John's words mimic what his stepfather said before beating him when he was 12, infuriating him. John and the other boys humiliate Jeremy, stripping him naked and taunting him. His powers begin to manifest by pulling at their metal buttons and any piercings. Eventually, a large spherical electromagnetic pulse erupts throwing Jeremy into a mud puddle and everyone else to the ground. John is found still, with his heart stopped. Jeremy uses an electric shock to revive him. Jeremy returns to the farm where he grew up, now in probate with the bank, and finds that all of his possessions have been removed. He is joined by Jessie, Donald, and Doug, who persuade Jeremy to come with them to find a place where he will not be feared and misunderstood. Instead, he runs into a field where a lightning bolt strikes him, and he disappears in a blinding flash of light. The electrical jolt hits Jessie, Donald, Doug, and Harley. CastMusic The film's score was written by Jerry Goldsmith. Salva personally wanted Goldsmith to score the music of the film because he had been \\"an enormous fan\\" of the composer's work. Reception Powder received generally mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes it has a rating of 50% based on 20 reviews, with an average rating of 5.2/10.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/powder/ Caryn James of The New York Times described the film as \\"lethally dull\\" with Goldblum's dry humor offering the only tolerable moments in the film. \\"This intensely self-important film has no idea how absurd and unconvincing it is.\\" Leonard Maltin wrote in his Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide: \\"Earnest, but doesn't add up to much.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film 2 stars out of a possible 4. He criticized numerous plot holes as well as Flanery's makeup, which resembled a mime more than an albino. He wrote: \\"'Powder' has all of the elements of a successful fantasy, and none of the insights. It's a movie where intriguing ideas lie there on the screen, jumbled and unrealized. It leads up to bathos, not pathos, because not enough attention was paid to the underlying truth of the characters. They're all just pawns for the plot gimmicks.\\" Controversy The film's production by Disney resulted in a controversy over the choice of writer-director Victor Salva, who had been convicted of molesting a 12-year-old child actor during the production of his previous film, Clownhouse (1988). He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment and released after 15 months. Disney officials reported that they learned of Salva's crime only after production of Powder had begun, and stressed that there were no minors on the set for the film. When Powder was released, the victim, Nathan Forrest Winters, came forward again in an attempt to get others to boycott the film in protest at Disney's hiring Salva. In a 2015 appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, comedian Barry Crimmins criticized the plot of Powder for implying that a child has power over an adult as representing a veiled or allegorical defense of Salva's history as a sex offender.Infamy that has no end, Chicago Tribune, October 29, 1995Victim speaks out against molester, TimesDaily, October 25, 1995Joe Rogan interviews Barry Crimmins & Bobcat Goldthwait, Joe Rogan, August 6, 2015 ReferencesExternal links  * * Category:1995 films Category:Hollywood Pictures films Category:Caravan Pictures films Category:1995 drama films Category:American fantasy films Category:American films Category:Films set in Houston Category:Films shot in Houston Category:Albinism in popular culture Category:Films directed by Victor Salva Category:Films scored by Jerry Goldsmith Category:Films produced by Roger Birnbaum ","title":"Powder (film)"},{"id":"2731005","text":"Biscoe Islands is a series of islands, of which the principal ones are Renaud, Lavoisier (named Serrano by Chile and Mitre by Argentina), Watkins, Krogh, Pickwick and Rabot, lying parallel to the west coast of Graham Land and extending between Southwind Passage on the northeast and Matha Strait on the southwest.

Da Capo began as a series of prelude short scenarios in the Suika fandisc Archimedes no Wasuremono, and since the initial release, there have been numerous different versions released for Windows and PlayStation 2 over the years with updated scenarios and characters. The gameplay in Da Capo follows a plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the seven female main characters.

A sequel set 53 years after the end of Da Capo, Da Capo II, was released on May 26, 2006 and features a new cast of characters living two generations after the original. Da Capo is set on a fictional island in modern Japan, , where the sakura trees are always in full blossom. Da capo is an Italian musical term meaning \\"from the beginning\\", and the game was such named with parts of the storyline looping before approaching the true end. There have been numerous adaptations into other media. Two manga series were serialized between 2003 and 2006 in Kadokawa Shoten's Comptiq magazine illustrated by different manga artists.

Two radio shows, five novel adaptations, four drama CD adaptations, and an original video animation series have also been produced. Gameplay Da Capo's gameplay requires little interaction from the player, as it is a classic visual novel: most of the duration of the game is spent simply reading the text that appears on the screen which represents either dialogue between the various characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. Every so often, the player will come to a point where he or she is given the chance to choose from multiple options. The time between these points is variable and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer. Gameplay pauses at these points and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are seven main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. To view all seven plot lines, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and make different decisions to progress the plot in an alternate direction. Throughout gameplay, the player enables the viewing of sex scenes depicting the protagonist, Jun'ichi, and one of the seven heroines having sex. Plot Da Capo centers around Jun'ichi Asakura, who lives with his adopted sister Nemu on Hatsune, a fictional crescent-shaped island where cherry blossoms bloom all year long, where they attend high school. On this island, people have mysterious powers and attributes, sourced by the unwilting magical cherry tree. Jun'ichi can see other people's dreams. One of his friends, Kotori Shirakawa, is an idol at the school who can \\"read minds\\". One day, to Jun'ichi's surprise, his cousin Sakura Yoshino comes back from America all of a sudden, who looks exactly the same girl that moved away six years ago, and has not aged one bit. She returned to remind Jun'ichi of their childhood promise. Development Da Capo was Circus's sixth game, but was the fourth game developed by the development group Circus Northern who had also produced their second title Suika. The game's production was headed by Tororo, president of Circus, who also worked on the game's music, and was directed by Mikage and Hotaru Koizumi. The scenario in the game was divided between four people who worked on the different stories for the heroines. Mikage wrote Nemu's and Sakura's scenarios; Kure (short for Soratobuenban ni Kure ga Notta yo) wrote Kotori's and Yoriko's scenarios; Yoko Yoko wrote Moe's and Mako's scenarios; and Mari wrote Miharu's scenario. Character design and art direction was divided between three people. Naru Nanao designed Nemu, Sakura, and Kotori; Igul designed Miharu, Moe, Mako, and others; and Kanon Ikutata designed the chibi characters, and others.

They were called \\"Coal Tanks\\" because they were a side tank version of Webb's standard 17 in Coal Engine, an 0-6-0 tender engine for slow freight trains. Design The design was introduced in 1881 by F.W. Webb and had the same cheaply produced cast iron wheels and H-section spokes as the tender engines. A trailing radial axle supporting the bunker was added also with two similarly cast iron wheels. Three hundred were built between 1881 and 1897.

They were renumbered from the LNWR's random allocation based on vacant numbers, to a solid block sequence 7550‚Äì7841, and given the power classification 1F. Many locomotives still in service in 1934 were renumbered by the addition of 20,000 to their number.

The film features Spencer Tracy, Pat O'Brien, and James Arness.. Plot James Curtayne (Tracy) has retired from criminal law, but when Johnny O'Hara (Arness), a boy from the neighborhood, is accused of a murder, Curtayne takes the case. The boy's parents plead for Curtayne's help, even though they are too poor to pay him a fee. A man Johnny knew was shot and killed during the night by two people in a passing car. The only witness, from a distance, was a man coming out of a diner. Johnny flees when the cops come to question him. Once the boy is in custody, Detective Ricks (O'Brien) and District Attorney Barra (John Hodiak) explain that a gun owned by Johnny appears to be the murder weapon. A young punk, Pete Korvac (William Campbell), is claiming that he was Johnny's accomplice in the crime and is willing to testify that Johnny pulled the trigger. Johnny insists he was working all night, but no one can verify that. What he refuses to tell the authorities, or even his own lawyer, is that he was with Katrina Lanzetta (Yvette Duguay), the young wife of a local gangster known as Knuckles (Eduardo Ciannelli). She has fallen in love with Johnny, but he is determined to protect her honor and her safety. Curtayne's daughter Ginny (Diana Lynn) didn't want her widower dad to take on such a stressful case because he is a recovering alcoholic. Ginny lives with him, putting her own future with boyfriend Jeff (Richard Anderson) on hold. Curtayne expresses confidence he can handle the strain. He goes to see the Korvac family, trying to learn why young Pete, who has a criminal past, would double-cross Johnny this way. He also visits Knuckles, who knew the victim and is volunteering to help Curtayne, but the lawyer neither trusts nor believes Knuckles and declines his offer. The case begins to go badly for the defense. Johnny's alibi about being at work proves to be a lie. Pete's chatty testimony is convincing and Curtayne has been unable to rattle him. Curtayne confides in Ricks, his friend, that he is becoming forgetful at inopportune times in court. Desperate, knowing that Johnny's life is on the line, Curtayne not only resumes drinking, he bribes the eyewitness with $500 after learning the man, Sven Norson (Jay C. Flippen), is willing to change his story for a price. D.A. Barra discovers the bribe. He wins the case, convicting Johnny of murder, then must decide what to do about Curtayne's behavior, possibly seeking to have him disbarred. Curtayne, however, is tipped off by Ricks about the boy's relationship with gangster Knuckles' wife, who is willing to come forward and accept the consequences now that Johnny's been found guilty. Curtayne tries to set up Knuckles, certain that he is the one behind the murder. He wears a wire for the police, looking for a confession. Instead, it turns out one of Pete Korvac's brothers is the man who did the fatal shooting, and Curtayne ends up at gunpoint. By the time Ricks, Barra and others tailing him can get there to make an arrest, Curtayne ends up fatally shot. Cast * Spencer Tracy as James Curtayne * Pat O'Brien as Det.

Mandate Members of the CCGA are usually recreational boaters and commercial fishermen who use their vessels to assist the Canadian Coast Guard with search and rescue (SAR) as well as boating safety education. CCGA members who assist in SAR operations have their vessel insurance covered by CCG, as well as any fuel and operating costs associated with a particular tasking. The CCGA enables the CCG to provide maritime SAR coverage in many isolated areas of Canada's coastlines without having to maintain an active base and/or vessels in those areas. The auxiliary is dedicated to providing a permanent day and night search and rescue service to cover marine requirements in Canada and prevent the loss of life and injury. * Save lives at risk * Reduce the number and severity of SAR incidents * Promote marine safety * Support the Canadian Coast Guard * Provide a humanitarian service * Maintain the highest professional standards * Promote dedication and pride of membership History Coastal lifesaving stations manned by volunteers pre-dates Canadian Confederation (1867), with some coastal services in what is now Atlantic Canada dating to the early 1800s. The country's first motorized lifeboat was established in 1907 by volunteers at Bamfield, British Columbia. Formal responsibility for organizing and overseeing search and rescue in Canada was given to the Minister of National Defence in 1951. This responsibility mostly fell to the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) which, in coordination with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), delineated search and rescue regions (SRRs) to be overseen by rescue coordination centres (RCCs) that would manage SAR response activities. Changes to the Canada Shipping Act in 1961 and the formation of the Canadian Coast Guard in 1962 saw the Department of Transport, which had responsibility for the CCG from 1962-1995, given responsibility for maritime search and rescue in support of the Minister of National Defence's mandate. As a result, the Minister of Transport designated \\"marine rescue controllers\\" who were CCG personnel that would work within the RCAF's rescue co-ordination centres. The RCCs were renamed joint rescue coordination centres (JRCCs) to denote the dual role of air and maritime search and rescue as well as their joint operation by RCAF and CCG personnel. CCG search and rescue officials first formally recognized volunteer rescuers in 1963. Volunteer \\"search masters\\" were individuals with access to seaworthy boats equipped with radios and volunteer \\"rescue agents\\" were individuals who served as local points of communication with CCG maritime rescue controllers operating in JRCCs. A special metal sign was provided to identify an individual who volunteered with maritime search and rescue. A distinctive pennant based on the design of the CCG jack was also issued: white hoist, blue fly, single red maple leaf with the letters S and R on either side of the leaf. By the mid 1970s, it became clear that a formal organization for training volunteer search and rescuers was necessary in order to improve the CCG's response to maritime search and rescue incidents, particularly in remote locations. This was confirmed in a 1975 study commissioned by CCG and led to the Canadian Marine Rescue Auxiliary or CMRA being formed in late 1978 as a non-profit organization in an effort to enhance search and rescue coverage and capability, and to better coordinate volunteer efforts. The CMRA was renamed the Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary or CCGA in 1997. Current operations Similar to its predecessor, the CMRA, the CCGA is a non-profit organization of volunteers who provide maritime search and rescue services for the federal government upon request from one of Canada's three Joint Rescue Coordination Centres (JRCCs) and two MRSC's. CCGA units may respond on their own or may be asked to respond with regular CCG search and rescue vessels or Royal Canadian Air Force aircraft, as determined by the JRCC in charge of coordinating the response. Some CCGA units on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts as well as the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River actually have dedicated rescue vessels such as rigid hull inflatable boats similar to the Zodiac Hurricane 733 or Titan 249 XL. These vessels are owned and equipped by non-profit organizations located in the communities where the vessels are home ported but are still crewed by volunteers. The organizations, their volunteers and their vessels are part of the CCGA. In some cases the coxswains of these vessels receive fast rescue craft (FRC) training from CCG; CCG Station Bamfield in British Columbia and CCG Station Sambro in Nova Scotia. =Regions= The CCGA operations are divided into five regions which reflect the way that the Canadian Coast Guard is also organized. Each region is separately incorporated and is a registered charity under the Canada Revenue Agency with the ability to issue charitable donation receipts. ;Newfoundland and Labrador CCGA operations in Newfoundland and Labrador are grouped under Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary (Newfoundland and Labrador) Incorporated. (see: http://ccga-nl.ca) ;Maritimes CCGA operations in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island are grouped under Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary (Maritimes) Incorporated.

RCMSAR has its origins from the CCGA-Pacific and re-branded itself in 2012 as RCMSAR to reflect the service's distinct geographic identity and support to multiple jurisdictions. The change assisted the public in British Columbia to better understand the community-based nature of the service and the importance of local support in maintaining rescue vessels, recruiting and training volunteers, and equipping them with the tools they need to save lives on the water. The title \\"Royal\\" was granted by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in February 2012 in recognition of the organization's long-standing service, broad geographic coverage, and philanthropic mandate. In 2017, RCMSAR signed a memorandum of understanding with the Province of British Columbia to allow local authorities and provincial agencies to request assistance from RCMSAR directly in times of emergency specifically related to their jurisdictions. Marine search and rescue in federal waters remains RCMSAR's core operation and primary support function. In 2017, RCMSAR also signed a memorandum of understanding establishing a relationship with the 4th Canadian Ranger Patrol Group for the purpose of training and operational collaboration. Uniforms Although the majority of CCGA volunteers across Canada respond to incidents upon being tasked by a JRCC in civilian clothes, the service does have a uniform that can be worn on formal occasions and occasionally on operations. These CCGA uniforms are based on Canadian Coast Guard uniforms, however, they differ by having unique CCGA badges and insignia that are silver in colour whereas regular CCG fleet personnel have gold insignia. RCMSAR retains a distinct operational uniform that is worn as part of their crew's personal protective equipment on dedicated response vessels.
