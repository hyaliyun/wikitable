Not that the world's premier female superhero makes any direct appearances in the world premiere that opened Tuesday at Marin Theatre Company, but aspects of her infuse the generations of feminists who inspired and were inspired by her in an idea-packed and brilliantly cartoon-enhanced play. *Behind the Eye from City Beat Cincinnati: According to Carson Kreitzer's new script, Behind the Eye, premiering at the Cincinnati Playhouse, Lee Miller 'reflects light so well it seems that she herself is the source.' Miller, you see, is a forgotten but real historical figure, a photographer's model in Vogue in the 1920s, a photographer herself in the 1930s and a fearless photojournalist across Europe during World War II. By any standards she was promiscuous and willful, a free spirit for whom happiness was just beyond her grasp. She is the fascinating focal point for Kreitzer's compelling new play [...], perhaps the best piece of theater at the Playhouse this season. *1:23 from Atlanta's Creative Loafing: Playwright Carson Kreitzer's drama draws on elements of police procedurals like Law & Order in its investigation of the crimes of Susan Smith and two other notorious mothers who killed their children. In 1:23, we know whodunit, so the more pressing question becomes, 'Why did they do it?' Kreitzer's script finds clues in official records, urban legends and Latin-American folklore, placing the killings in complex, almost baffling cultural and psychological contexts. [...] Few themes prove as big or challenging as the ones raised in 1:23. If anything, the play's ambition nearly overleaps itself in its attempt to address too many ideas in too limited a time. 1:23 serves as a harrowing thematic symphony that can be overly pretentious and opaque, yet also builds to some genuine revelations. *Valerie Shoots Andy from The New York Times: Ms. Kreitzer offers an assessment of how Solanas's play (Up Your Ass) and a diatribe she wrote shortly before the shooting called the SCUM manifesto evolved into gunshots. It is a bleak but fascinating piece that plays with Warhol's notions of repetition, returning to the shooting and its immediate aftermath again and again as it fleshes out the portrait of Solanas, who died in 1988.

The album was recorded in October 2005 in Switzerland and released in October 2006 by ECM. Produced by Manfred Eicher, it was Favre's first album for ECM in eleven years and marked the return of the ensemble since their 1984 debut Singing Drums, presenting a new line-up that departed from the previous incarnation's all-percussion sound. The new line-up included seven musicians and new instrumentation, including harp, double clarinet, double bass, tuba, guitar, bass guitar, soprano saxophone, and serpent. The latter instrument is rarely used in jazz. The music has a deep bottom end due to the low-end instruments, but Favre keeps a light texture, partly due to the low instruments being played in their highest registers and arrangements which highlight different instruments. The album was influenced by Renaissance music and baroque music. Favre maintains a melodic sound which doesn't dominate over other instruments. Music critics praised Fleuve. Background and recording As a drummer, Favre built a career as one of jazz's most respected percussionists. His work has become defined by a lack of boundaries, working in styles such as free jazz, world music, and contemporary classical music. For ECM he has contributed to many albums, including John Surman's Such Winters of Memory (1983), Dino Saluzzi's Once Upon a Time - Far Away in the South (1986) and Paul Giger's Alpstein (1991). Volkshaus, Basel, Switzerland, where Fleuve was recorded Favre's first album as leader for ECM was Singing Drums (1984), an all-percussion recording and the first album by the Pierre Favre Ensemble, at the time consisting of Favre, Paul Motian, Fredy Studer, and Nana Vasconcelos. Singing Drums established his \\"fertile relationship\\" with ECM. Although the album inspired Favre's Singing Drums ensemble, which recorded the album Souffles (1998) for Swiss label Intakt Records, he did not record another album with the ensemble until Fleuve. Fleuve is Favre's first album for ECM in over a decade, his final up until that point being Window Steps (1995). It is a return for the Pierre Favre Ensemble, now containing a new line-up of Favre on percussion and drums, Wolfgang Zwiauer on bass guitar, Michel Godard on tuba and serpent, Frank Kroll on bass clarinet and soprano saxophone, Philipp Schaufelberger on guitar, H√©l√®ne Breschand on harp, and B√§nz Oester on double-bass. This line-up was considered unconventional, with one writer noting that the inclusion of the serpent, a military horn, was particularly unusual for a jazz album. The album was recorded in October 2005 at Volkshaus, Basel, Switzerland, with ECM owner Manfred Eicher producing the recording and with engineering by Daniel Dettweiler. The space in Eicher's production were said by Thom Jurek of AllMusic to provide \\"an unhurried sense of time's stasis,\\" thus making the album \\"all the more appealing\\" in that it slowly brings listeners through the recording. Eicher mixed the album with Favre at Idee Und Klang Studio, Switzerland. Music Pierre Favre in October 2005, the month Fleuve was recorded Throughout Fleuve, the ensemble has a naturally deep bottom end, due to Favre's drums, O√´ster's double bass, Zwiauer's bass guitar and Godard's tuba and serpent playing, with the middle- to high-end instrumentation courtesy of Schaufelberger's guitar, Kroll's soprano saxophone and bass clarinet and Breschand's harp. Despite featuring very bottom-heavy instrumentation, the music has been noted by critics for its light, airy, ethereal sound. The light texture to the music is largely provided by several characteristics, namely numerous instruments playing concurrently, low instruments often being played in their highest registers, arrangements with shifting instrument focuses at any given time, and the \\"touch used by the bassists.\\" Budd Kopman of All About Jazz writes of the overall sound: Elements of Renaissance and baroque music are evident throughout the album's blended musical textures. Barry Witherden of BBC Music Magazine feel it is the bass, drums, guitar and harp which combine to \\"carry the pulse\\" against the strong rhythmic backdrop on all seven compositions. Although Favre is the bandleader, he generally keeps to a melodic sound that generally places his drums equal to other instruments in the mix, although he does not forgo the larger rhythmic aspect of the drums, as is evidenced by \\"Reflet Sud,\\" which \\"moves inexorably and insistently forward.\\" Regardless, Steve Futterman of Jazz Times writes that Favre's \\"selfless adherence to big-picture equilibrium\\" means that he rarely feels like the band leader. =Structure= French tuba and serpent player Michel Godard Opening track \\"Mort d'Eurydice\\" alludes to Renaissance music and starts with a harp and percussion-based free section. The piece's central section features a bass-set rhythm resembling a heartbeat. \\"Panama\\" is the most melodic track, with figures from the harp and double bass accompanied by hand percussion, before giving way to a flash of cymbals announcing a more ethereal section where the guitar approximates a melody. The track contains three solos and ends with a brief, non-sequitur coda. \\"Reflet Sud\\" displays the anchoring tuba and serpent balancing the basses, before the guitar work moves the instruments into a middle-range improvisation. \\"Fire Red-Gas Blue- Ghost Green\\" is said to be the most ethereal track, which opens with bass guitar and double bass and transforms into a jazz tune containing Middle Eastern modalities. Writer Andy Kelman writes that the track's \\"Middle-to-Far Eastern flavor\\" is countered by its \\"more expansive landscape\\" with Schaufelberger's guitar solo and Kroll's bass clarinet solo. A steady bass drum largely supports the other instrumentation throughout \\"Nile\\", which features low-end serpent working against the \\"pinging\\" harp. Favre's percussion is most emphasised on \\"Decors,\\" which contains the album's only genuine drum solo. Futterman felt Favre's \\"evocative hand-drumming\\" on the track \\"[breaks] past a stately theme.\\" Witherden detected the influence of Tudor music on the piece, while Kopman more broadly wrote that the song creates tension via its constant shift \\"between Renaissance dance and African polyrhythms.\\" Release and reception Fleuve was released on 10 October 2006 by ECM Records. It features a photograph by Jean-Guy Lathuili√®re on the album cover and further photographs in the liner notes by Ueli N√ºesch. The album received positive reviews from music critics. Thom Jurek of AllMusic called the album \\"beautiful\\" and stated: \\"Fleuve is an album of gorgeous, flowing textures and sound colors that seduce the listener toward them, bringing them slowly along through the recording\\".Jurek, T., Allmusic Review accessed May 19, 2014 Steve Futterman of Jazz Times was largely favourable, saying that \\"Favre rigorously transforms Fleuve into a kaleidoscope of surprising musical colors.\\" Though expressing a \\"niggling complaint\\" in that Kroll's piping soprano saxophone \\"can land the quirky group sound back in overly familiar ECM territory,\\" he nonetheless felt the combinations of the other instruments were imaginative and help distinguish the project from other jazz albums. He also felt that Favre's \\"lean toward scrupulous craft\\" was perhaps emblematic of his Swiss background. Barry Witherden of BBC Music Magazine called Fleuve one of Favre's \\"most captivating albums\\" and wrote that \\"it is the agreeable melodies and the ingenious, fresh and attractive voicings that distinguish the session.\\" All About Jazz correspondent Budd Kopman felt that Fleuve highlights that Favre not only masters his own instrument but also \\"has complete command in the fields of composition and arrangement.\\" He felt that the album was \\"timeless\\" despite its allusions to Renaissance music on \\"Mort d'Eurydice\\" and \\"Decors,\\" with each track boasting an individual charm, and concluded that \\"Favre has created music of many layers that exists totally outside of any specific genre. By turns profound, exciting and overtly beautiful, Fleuve is art of the highest degree\\".Kopman, B., All About Jazz Review, July 30, 2007 Also writing for Just About Jazz, John Kelman said: \\"There are those who believe that percussionists don't make compelling composers and/or bandleaders. Favre's small but significant body of work for ECM lays waste to any such claims, with Fleuve the best argument yet\\".Kelman, J., All About Jazz Review, April 18, 2007 Les Inrockuptibles called Fleuve a \\"majestic\\" album.

Security footage reveals √Ångel fleeing from his job at the morgue before being struck by a car. Pe√±a is informed that the body of a woman, Mayka Villaverde, has disappeared from the morgue. Mayka, a middle-aged, wealthy businesswoman, was married to a younger man and suffered a heart attack following a business trip. Her widower, √Ålex Ulloa, hears the shocking news while with his young mistress, Carla Miller. √Ålex assures Carla that Mayka is dead. At the morgue, √Ålex tells the coroner about Mayka's medical history. Pe√±a is convinced someone stole the body to avoid an autopsy and is suspicious of √Ålex, who Pe√±a feels too easily speaks of his wife in the past tense. Pe√±a notes his wife, Ruth, died 10 years ago in a car accident, and he finds he still speaks of her in the present tense. √Ålex hears a loud noise and discovers a busted locker. Inside, he finds a small bottle labeled TH‚Äì16, and thinks back earlier in the day when he puts drops from the same bottle into Mayka's wine. Pe√±a finds him and informs him that Mayka's cell phone is missing. He finds the bottle on √Ålex, who admits it is a toxin manufactured by Mayka's pharmaceutical company, but he claims he found it on the floor and doesn't know what it does. More and more events occur at the morgue that seems to be taunting √Ålex and Carla, convincing √Ålex that Mayka is still alive and seeking revenge for his affair and murder plot. √Ålex discovers Mayka hired a private investigator, as she suspected his affair, and had also heard him plotting to kill her. √Ålex confesses everything to Pe√±a, first telling him he did love Mayka, having met her by chance in Avalon, California. He also met Carla by chance but fell in love with her, and confided in her his darkest secrets. He said that he thinks Mayka only pretended to drink the wine laced with TH‚Äì16, which causes a heart attack after eight hours and leaves no trace in the blood, but that she instead took a tranquilizer that made her appear dead. The police discover incriminating evidence at √Ålex and Mayka's house, including a map of the morgue. √Ångel wakes up from his coma and reveals that after hearing a noise, he saw Mayka's body in the elevator before a figure in a balaclava fired a gun at him, sending him running into the street. √Ålex insists Mayka is alive and has the means to disappear and that Carla is in danger. Pe√±a informs him they have no evidence Carla Miller exists and that the address he gave for Carla's apartment has been empty for years. While transporting √Ålex, the police discover a body in the woods. √Ålex fears it's Carla, but it's Mayka. √Ålex tries to escape and Pe√±a runs after him. √Ålex collapses and claims he needs an ambulance. Pe√±a tells him about the car accident that killed his wife and that she was murdered, as her life could have been saved if the other driver had called for help instead of fleeing the scene; Pe√±a and his 10-year-old daughter, Eva, watched helplessly as Ruth died an hour later. He then tells √Ålex that only recently Eva had remembered the logo on a keychain hanging from the other car's rearview mirror: Avalon, California. It was √Ålex and Mayka who had fled the scene and left Ruth to die. Pe√±a then shows √Ålex a photo of his daughter Eva: Carla Miller. It was Pe√±a and Eva who had taken Mayka's body and conspired to frame him. Eva initially wasn't convinced of their guilt until √Ålex revealed his darkest secrets to her, including the hit-and-run. √Ålex, now gasping to breathe, learns that eight hours earlier, Eva had dosed him with TH‚Äì16, and his death will be explained as a heart attack brought on by stress.

Gutierrez graduated cum laude from Yale University with a bachelor's degree in psychology in 2010. As a Yale Journalism scholar, Gutierrez worked with various publications, was a reporter for the undergraduate-run monthly television newsmagazine YTV News,http://www.yale.edu/ytv/ytvnews/team.html and was co-editor-in-chief of the Yale Journal of Human Rights.  Career  = Rappler = After graduation, Gutierrez first took up a job with a digital marketing firm in New York City and then moved to Dallas to work for a public relations firm. A trip back to the Philippines put her in contact with journalist Maria Ressa, who invited her to become a reporter for Rappler, where she regularly anchored the daily Rappler Newscast. Stories in which Gutierrez' coverage have played a significant role include the 2013 Serendra explosion, in which her coverage raised questions about whether the gas responsible for the explosion had been odorless and may thus have made residents unable to detect the leak; and the Priority Development Assistance Fund scam. In August 2013, the latter coverage resulted in Janet Lim-Napoles filing a libel case against Gutierrez, a number of other journalists, and a blogger who had posted pictures allegedly of Napoles' daughter, depicting a supposedly lavish lifestyle.

In the 1950s and '60s, he spearheaded along with other artists such as Jorge Oteiza, Remigio Mendiburu, or Eduardo Chillida, an avant-garde artistic movement concerned with the crisis of Basque identity, and formally a special focus on large volumes and the concept of emptiness. Career In the 1952 Basterretxea was commissioned along with other Basque artists the reconstruction of the Franciscan Sanctuary of Arantzazu. He was assigned the works to design the paintings covering the crypt. After a year-long period and halfway to completion, the paintings were held to be controversial by Church officials and works were suspended sine die. Despite their completion in 1984, the paintings were publicly unveiled and put on show only in September 2009, after an agreement was finally reached with the veteran artist. The Arantzazu reconstruction project paved the way to the establishment of the influential artistic group Gaur ('today') in the 1960s. In 1973, he presented in Bilbao's Museo de Bellas Artes (Bilbao Fine Arts Museum) his work Serie Cosmogonica Vasca (Basque Cosmogonic Series), which included some 19 works made in wood depicting Basque Mythology motifs. In 2008, Nestor donated this series to the Bilbao Fine Arts Museum. In the 1980s Basterretxea became Culture Councillor for the Basque Government for two years. In 1982, he created the seven branched tree that heads the Basque Parliament. Towards the end of that decade, he created two of his best known works: La Paloma de Paz (Peace Dove), initially installed at the Zurriola seafront, Donostia (San Sebastian), later on moved to a roundabout outside the Anoeta Stadium of the same city, and back to the same location somewhat later. In 1989, the Memorial to the Basque Shepherd was installed in Reno, Nevada. When Basterretxea entered his seventh decade of life, he started to reflect the Basque conflict in his work. Basterretxea also engaged in film making, with short films such as Operaci√≥n H (1963), Pelotari (1964), as well as Alqu√©zar, retablo de pasi√≥n (1965), as well as several other documentaries. In 1968, he came back onto the spotlight with the full feature documentary Ama Lur - Tierra Madre ('mother earth'), co- directed with Fernando Larruquert. Despite the documentary's countless difficulties with Franco's regime's censorship, it ultimately made it through to the San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival, to public and critical acclaim. Basterretxea died at his home in Hondarribia in the morning of 12 July 2014, at the age of 90.

Plot summary After the death of her doctor husband Neil, Mrs. Ferris sells her home and the Ashborough medical practice to Dr. Michael Cayle. At his wife Christine's insistence, Michael moves Christine and their young daughter Jessica from New York to the small town of Ashborough, New Hampshire for a quieter life. New neighbor Phil Dreighton introduces the Cayles to his grandson Tyler and invites the family to his house for lunch. While using the Dreightons‚Äô bathroom, Michael meets Phil's wife Rosy, who has a severely scarred face. Later, Michael and Christine agree that the timing is right to have another child. A package is delivered for the deceased Dr. Ferris. Michael opens it and discovers virus samples ranging from Ebola to the bubonic plague. Michael begins meeting various townspeople as his new patients. Lauren Hunter is strangely flirtatious. Phil goes hiking with Michael and shows him a stone altar in the forest covered with blood. Phil explains that centuries ago, a breed of wild men known as Isolates populated the area. People make sacrifices to the Isolates to keep their families safe from their savagery. Phil tells Michael that he is expected to make a blood sacrifice on the altar and that it was Phil's duty to explain the tradition to Michael just as it was explained to Phil by Lady Zellis when the Dreightons first moved to Ashborough. Michael assumes the idea is crazy. Michael takes Christine and Jessica to a church service to meet the rest of the townspeople. Rosy Dreighton pretends she is meeting Michael for the first time. After the service, Michael observes as his wife is suspiciously spirited away by Lady Zellis. Tyler starts to warn Michael about Lady Zellis before being stopped by Sheriff Andy Godbout's son AJ. Michael looks for Christine inside the church and Lauren Hunter tries seducing him again. When he spurns her, Lauren cryptically infers that Michael is the only one who can protect her, although she does not specify from what. Christine tells Michael that she is pregnant, but that in lieu of an OB/GYN, she wants to see the town's midwife Lady Zellis. Christine begins acting as if she is hiding something from Michael. Michael starts to see signs of an intruder throughout the house and begins having nightmares. Michael hears noises outside and kills a goat that startles him. However, when he goes back to clean up the carcass, the goat is gone. While Michael is home alone, Lauren shows up covered in blood with her stomach torn open. Michael futilely tries calling for an ambulance only to discover Lauren's body missing when he returns outside. Sheriff Godbout does not take Michael's claim of Lauren's murder seriously. Michael tries driving out of town, but his car will not start. Lauren is then found on the road, her death made to look like an accident. Michael finds more signs of someone or something stalking his family inside their home. Lady Zellis pays Michael a visit. She cryptically tells him that ‚Äúthey‚Äù will be coming for him so that he may deliver a child and if he were not needed, he would already be dead because he did not complete the sacrifice. Michael's home office is then invaded by feral Isolates, who drag him to their caverns where he is forced to deliver the child of a pregnant savage. Michael visits Phil for answers. Phil says they cannot talk because the Isolates can hear them and that no one will help because fear of the tribe runs so deep. Phil also reveals that the Isolates took his wife Rosy, and left her eyeballs on his nightstand. Michael begs his wife to tell him what she knows. Christine says she cannot reveal anything for their own safety and infers that Michael should sacrifice their family dog on the woodland altar. Michael attempts to do so, but Jessica interrupts him. The next day, Michael boards up the windows on his house, although Tyler warns Michael that it won't keep the Isolates out if they want to find a way in. Later, the Isolates abduct Michael again and force him to kill Phil in the caves. Tyler confronts Michael about his father's death and asks for help killing the Isolates. Michael tells Tyler to seek help elsewhere. Tyler tells him that Lady Zellis runs the town and keeps the residents in line with the tea that everyone is forced to drink. Knowing that the Isolates listen to their words, Michael passes Tyler a note about arranging an escape plan. Michael packs the family's bags and flees in his minivan with Christine and Jessica. Sheriff Godbout tries stopping them, but Christine runs him over. The Cayles are drawn back to town by Tyler's screams. Michael finds Lady Zellis cutting Tyler's chest while he is tied to a chair and Michael threatens her with a blade to escape with Tyler. Everyone flees in the minivan, but Christine crashes into a fallen tree, forcing everyone to retreat to the Cayle home. The Isolates attack and kill Tyler. While Michael attends to Christine's injuries, Jessica is abducted. Michael arms himself with a syringe of bubonic plague that he uses to infect the Isolates on his next trip underground. The Isolates die and Michael rescues Jessica. When Michael returns home, he finds Lady Zellis delivering Christine's baby while surrounded by a handful of townspeople. Christine apologizes to Michael for deceiving him as she gives birth to an Isolate. Later, Michael finds an old photograph of Christine as a child and realizes that she is standing in front of a mailbox labeled ‚ÄúZellis.‚Äù Film adaptation Chiller officially announced plans to film an adaptation of Deep in the Darkness in mid 2013 and also announced that the movie would have a limited theatrical release before it went to VOD. The film starred Sean Patrick Thomas as Dr. Michael Cayle and Dean Stockwell as Phil Deighton, and featured a score by Matthew Llewellyn. The film officially released on April 29, 2014. Shock Till You Drop gave the movie a score of five out of ten, stating that while it had some effective jump scares and a good cast, they felt that the film was mostly unmemorable. The New York Times panned the film, expressing disappointment that the film did not live up to its full potential. Shout Factory released the film on April 21, 2015 on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in the United States.

Description The initial design of Novena started in 2012. It was developed by Sutajio Ko-usagi Pte. Ltd. and funded by a crowdfunding campaign which began on April 15, 2014. The first offering was a 1.2 GHz Freescale Semiconductor quad-core ARM architecture (i.MX6) computer closely coupled with a Xilinx FPGA. It was offered in \\"desktop\\", \\"laptop\\", or \\"heirloom laptop\\" form, or as a standalone motherboard. The open-source hardware laptop motherboard, Novena, by Andrew \\"bunnie\\" Huang and Sean \\"Xobs\\" Cross. On May 19, 2014, the crowdfunding campaign concluded having raised just over 280% of its target. The extra funding allowed the project to achieve 4 \\"stretch goals\\": the development of free and open source graphics drivers for the on-board video accelerator (etnaviv); the inclusion of a general-purpose breakout board providing 16 FPGA outputs and 8 FPGA inputs (3.3V or 5V gang-selectable via software), six 10-bit analog inputs (up to 200ksps sample rate) and two 10bit analog outputs (~100ksps max rate); the inclusion of a \\"ROMulator\\" breakout board capable of emulating TSOP NAND flash devices; and inclusion of a MyriadRF software defined radio at all hardware-purchasing backing levels. The three hardware stretch goals shipped in the form of add-on boards that use the Novena's special high-speed I/O expansion header, as seen in the upper-left of the Novena board.

He is one of Canada's youngest convicted serial killers, and his trial drew national attention. A 15-year-old girl, Loren Donn Leslie, has been included in the list of missing women and girls suspected as victims in the Highway of Tears murders. Background Cody Legebokoff is a Canadian citizen who was born on 21 January 1990 and raised in Fort St. James, a district municipality in rural British Columbia. He has been described by friends and family members as a popular young man who competed in ice hockey and showed no propensity for violence. Though Legebokoff had a minor criminal record, he was not \\"on the radar\\" of local police. After graduating Fort St. James Secondary School, Legebokoff lived briefly in Lethbridge, Alberta, before moving to Prince George, British Columbia. There, he shared an apartment with three close female friends and worked at a Ford dealership. In his spare time, Legebokoff frequented the Canadian social-networking site Nexopia, using the handle \\"1CountryBoy.\\"  2010 arrest  On November 27, 2010, at approximately 9:45 p.m., rookie Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officer, Constable Aaron Kehler, observed Legebokoff pull his truck onto British Columbia Highway 27 from a remote logging road. According to a case report written by Kehler, Legebokoff's 2004 GMC pick-up truck was speeding erratically and, on a hunch, the officer decided to pull over the vehicle for a routine traffic stop. He believed that it was odd and even suspicious that someone would be on that road, that late, in frigid November. Kehler suspected the driver of poaching in the backwoods and signaled for him to pull over. Kehler was joined by a second RCMP officer. Both officers said that upon searching Legebokoff's pickup truck, they discovered a multi-tool and wrench covered in blood, as well as a monkey backpack and a wallet containing a children's hospital card bearing the name Loren Leslie. When questioned about the blood on him, Legebokoff purportedly said that he was poaching and had clubbed a deer to death because: \\"I'm a redneck, that's what we do for fun.\\" The truck did not contain a deer carcass. The officers arrested Legebokoff under the Canada Wildlife Act and called for a conservation officer with animal tracking skills. The warden traced the tire tracks of Legebokoff's vehicle up the road and in the freshly fallen snow, found footprints leading to the remains of Loren Donn Leslie. After Legebokoff's arrest in connection with Leslie's death, he was linked by DNA analysis to the deaths of Jill Stacey Stuchenko, Cynthia Frances Maas, and Natasha Lynn Montgomery.  Victims  * Jill Stacey Stuchenko, 35-year-old mother of six, last seen on October 9, 2009. She was found dead four days later in a gravel pit on the outskirts of Prince George. * Natasha Lynn Montgomery, 23 year old mother of two, last seen August 31 or early September 1, 2010. Her body has never been found, but her DNA was later found in samples taken in Legebokoff's apartment. * Cynthia Frances Maas, 35, last seen September 10, 2010. Her body was found in a Prince George park the following month. Maas died of blunt-force trauma to the head and penetrating wounds. She had a hole in her shoulder blade, a broken jaw and cheekbone, and injuries to her neck consistent with someone's stomping on it. The Crown has said Stuchenko, Montgomery and Maas had worked in the sex trade. Legebokoff was addicted to cocaine and used sex workers to get him the drug. * Loren Donn Leslie, 15, murdered on November 27, 2010. Leslie was far younger than the other victims and allegedly met Legebokoff online at the website Nexopia. She was legally blind, having one completely blind eye and 50% vision in the other. Leslie is included in the list of murder victims found along the \\"Highway of Tears\\" in northern British Columbia.  Trial proceedings  Legebokoff's trial on four counts of first- degree murder was originally scheduled to begin in September 2013, but was delayed a month until October, and then again until June 2014. He pleaded not guilty to all four counts. The judge and twelve jurors heard testimony from 93 Crown witnesses and the defendant. Legebokoff testified during the trial that he was \\"involved\\" in three of the deaths but claimed that he did not commit the killings. He alleged that a drug dealer and two accomplices, whom he would only name as \\"X, Y and Z\\", were the actual murderers. Prosecutors did not accept this attempt to plead guilty to the lesser charge of second-degree murder.  Aftermath  Legebokoff was convicted on four counts of first- degree murder on September 11, 2014. On September 16, Legebokoff was sentenced to life in prison with no parole for 25 years. Additionally, British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Glen Parrett added him to the national sex offender registry, given the sexual assaults committed as part of the murders and Legebokoff's apparent degradation of the victims' bodies. \\"He lacks any shred of empathy or remorse,\\" Parrett said of the killer. \\"He should never be allowed to walk among us again.\\" In February 2015, Legebokoff filed an appeal due to decisions against change of venue and defendant's legal representation. In September 2016, all three judges in the BC Court of Appeal case endorsed the original judge's decision. Legebokoff was originally imprisoned at the Kent Institution but was transferred in March 2019 to the Warkworth Institution. Legacy The Legebokoff case is covered in the 2015 documentary Highway of Tears. Floridian writer J.T. Hunter profiled Legebokoff in the book The Country Boy Killer: The True Story of Cody Legebokoff, Canada's Teenage Serial Killer, published in 2015.  References   External links  * 2014 BCSC 1746.

The three former Kite executives subsequently hired into Allogene a number of people who left Kite after its sale. The notion behind Allogene was to create a 'next generation CAR-T' which was not tailored to a single individual, as YESCARTA was, but rather could be used in multiple patients, an allogeneic CAR-T. Pfizer received a 25% stake in Allogene and two seats on the company's board, while Allogene received rights to sixteen pre- clinical CAR-T assets and one Phase 1 allogeneic CAR-T clinical asset.

Life Born at St Austell, Cornwall, on 15 June 1831, he was son of Thomas Tallack (1801‚Äì65) and his wife Hannah (1800‚Äì76), daughter of Samuel Bowden, members of the Society of Friends. He was educated at Sidcot School (1842‚Äì5), and the Founders' College, Yorkshire (1852‚Äì4). He spent time teaching (1845‚Äì52 and 1855‚Äì8), but a friendship with the Quaker philanthropist Peter Bedford (1780‚Äì1864) determined his later career. In 1863 Tallack became secretary to the Society for the Abolition of Capital Punishment, exchanging this in 1866 for the same post in the Howard Association, which he held till 31 December 1901. As an activist for penal reform, he visited not only the continent of Europe, but Egypt, Australia, Tasmania, Canada, and the United States. He advocated in particular for more prison visitors, and lecturers. Tallack was one of the many critics of the prison administrator Edmund Frederick Du Cane, who included the Home Secretary H. H. Asquith and the prison chaplain William Douglas Morrison, but also found some emollient words for him, in 1894. His successor at the Howard Association at the end of 1901 was Edward Grubb. Around 1868, Tallack also started to work for the Peace Society. There he assisted Henry Richard, its secretary, and helped publish the Herald of Peace. He came onto the executive, where he encountered Leone Levi. In fact Leone and Tallack were soon to disagree, in 1871, on the issue of \\"reserve armies\\" that could enforce international arbitration, which Leone would not countenance. Tallack died at 61 Clapton Common on 25 September 1908, and was buried in the Friends' cemetery, Winchmore Hill, Middlesex. Works Tallack's religious writings and correspondence present a liberal type of evangelical religion, with broad sympathies. The Times, to which he contributed, in an obituary notice spoke of his style as \\"discursive and somewhat confused\\". His Penological and Preventive Principles (1888, 2nd edit. 1896) was considered a standard work. It argued for prisons that would prevent crime, and give offenders better treatment. Tallack found the state lacking in support for the concept of moral agency. Tallack's other books included: * Malta under the Phenicians, Knights and English, 1861. * Friendly Sketches in America, 1861 (noticed in John Paget's Paradoxes and Puzzles, 1874, 405-7). * Peter Bedford, the Spitalfields Philanthropist, 1865; 2nd edit. 1892. * A Common Sense Course for Diminishing the Evils of War, 1867. * Thomas Shillitoe, the Quaker Missionary and Temperance Pioneer, 1867. * George Fox, the Friends and the Early Baptists, 1868. * Humanity and Humanitarianism ...

A fairly complete bibliography of Tallack's writings to 1882 (including magazine articles) was in Bibliotheca Cornubiensis (1874‚Äì82). His advocacy found expression in tracts, addresses, flyleaves, and articles in periodicals. Family He married on 18 July 1867, at Stoke Newington, Augusta Mary (born 28 December 1844, died 21 January 1904), daughter of John Hallam Catlin. They had several children.

It is important to assess this condition because individuals with latent iron deficiency may develop iron-deficiency anemia. Additionally, there is some evidence of a decrease in vitality and an increase in fatigue among individuals with LID.  Diagnosis  = Diagnostic tests for latent iron deficiency LID = * complete blood count * hemoglobin * serum iron * total iron binding capacity * serum ferritin * bone marrow examination (rarely) Note: Iron therapy must be suspended 48 hours beforehand to ensure valid test results. The normal range for hemoglobin is 13.8 to 17.2 grams per deciliter (g/dL) for men and 12.1 to 15.1 g/dL for women. Low hemoglobin indicates anemia but will be normal for LID. Normal serum iron is between 60 and 170 micrograms per deciliter (Œºg/dL). Normal total iron-binding capacity for both sexes is 240 to 450 Œºg/dL. Total iron-binding capacity increases when iron deficiency exists. Serum ferritin levels reflect the iron stores available in the body. The normal range is 20 to 200 ng/mL for men and 15 to 150 ng/ml for women. Low levels (< 12 ng/mL) are specific for iron deficiency. However, inflammatory and neoplastic disorders can cause ferritin levels to increase - this may be seen in cases of hepatitis, leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and GI tract tumors. The most sensitive and specific criterion for iron- deficient erythropoiesis is depleted iron stores in the bone marrow. However, in practice, a bone marrow examination is rarely needed. = Interpretation of diagnostic test results in terms of stage of iron deficiency = LID is present in stage 1 and 2, before anemia occurs in stage 3. These first two stages can be interpreted as depletion of iron stores and reduction of effective iron transport. Stage 1 is characterized by loss of bone marrow iron stores while hemoglobin and serum iron levels remain normal. Serum ferritin falls to less than 20 ng/mL. Increased iron absorption, a compensatory change, results in an increased amount transferrin and consequent increased iron- binding capacity. Stage 2 - Erythropoiesis is impaired. In spite of an increased level of transferrin, serum iron level is decreased along with transferrin saturation. Erythropoiesis impairment begins when the serum iron level falls to less than 50 Œºg/dL and transferrin saturation is less than 16%. In stage 3, anemia (reduced hemoglobin levels) is present but red blood cell appearance remains normal. Changes in the appearance of red blood cells are the hallmark of stage 4; first microcytosis and then hypochromia develop. Iron deficiency begins to affect tissues in stage 5, manifesting as symptoms and signs.  Treatment  There is no consensus on how to treat LID but one of the options is to treat it as an iron-deficiency anemia with ferrous sulfate (Iron(II) sulfate) at a dose of 100 mg x day in two doses (one at breakfast and the other at dinner) or 3 mg x Kg x day in children (also in two doses) during two or three months. The ideal would be to increase the deposits of body iron, measured as levels of ferritin in serum, trying to achieve a ferritin value between 30 and 100 ng/mL. Another clinical study has shown an increase of ferritin levels in those taking iron compared with others receiving a placebo from persons with LID. With ferritin levels higher than 100 ng/mL an increase in infections, etc. has been reported. Another way to treat LID is with an iron rich diet and in addition ascorbic acid or Vitamin C, contained in many types of fruits as oranges, kiwifruits, etc. that will increase 2 to 5-fold iron absorption.  Epidemiology  There are many studies about LID and the frequency varies according to country of origin, diet, pregnancy status age, gender, etc. Depending on these previous conditions, the frequency can change from 11% in male athletes (Poland) to 44.7% in children less than 1 year old (China): Frequency of LID in different countries and populations: * Poland: 14 of LID (11%) in 131 male athletes and 31 of ID (26%) in 121 female athletes * India: 27.5% of LID amongst student nurses * Spain: 14.7% of LID in 211 women of child-bearing age in Barcelona * China: In 3591 pregnant women and 3721 premenopausal from 15 provinces. It was found: LID 42.6% in pregnant women (urban first-trimester 41.9%) (rural 36.1%) while 34.4% of LID in premenopausal non-pregnant women (urban 35.6%)(rural 32.4%). Pediatric samples: In 9118 children from 31 provinces aged 7 months to 7 years, the global incidence of LID in children was 32.5%.

The One Million Plan (;Tochnit hamillion) was a strategic plan for the immigration and absorption of one million Jews from Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa into Mandatory Palestine, within a timeframe of 18 months, in order to establish a state in that territory. After being voted on by the Jewish Agency for Israel Executive in 1944, it became the official policy of the Zionist leadership. Implementation of a significant part of the One Million Plan took place following the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948. When the extent of the decimation of Jews in the Holocaust became known in 1944, the Biltmore Conference ambition of two million immigrants was revised downwards, and the plan was revised to include, for the first time, Jews from the Middle East and North Africa as a single category within the target of an immigration plan.: \\"The principal significance of this plan lies in the fact, noted by Yehuda Shenhav, that this was the first time in Zionist history that Jews from Middle Eastern and North African countries were all packaged together in one category as the target of an immigration plan. There were earlier plans to bring specific groups, such as the Yemenites, but the \\"one million plan\\" was, as Shenhav says, \\"the zero point,\\" the moment when the category of mizrahi Jews in the current sense of this term, as an ethnic group distinct from European-born Jews, was invented.\\" In 1944‚Äì45, Ben-Gurion described the plan to foreign officials as being the \\"primary goal and top priority of the Zionist movement.\\": \\"In meetings with foreign officials at the end of 1944 and during 1945, Ben-Gurion cited the plan to enable one million refugees to enter Palestine immediately as the primary goal and top priority of the Zionist movement.\\" The ongoing immigration restrictions of the British White Paper of 1939 meant that such a plan was not able to be put into immediate effect. Upon the establishment of Israel, Ben Gurion's government presented the Knesset with a new plan - to double the population of 600,000 within 4 years. Israeli historian Devorah Hacohen describes the opposition against this immigration policy within the new Israeli government, such as those who argued that there was \\"no justification for organizing large-scale emigration among Jews whose lives were not in danger, particularly when the desire and motivation were not their own\\" as well as those who argued that the absorption process caused \\"undue hardship\\".: \\"Both the immigrants' dependence and the circumstances of their arrival shaped the attitude of the host society. The great wave of immigration in 1948 did not occur spontaneously: it was the result of a clear-cut foreign policy decision that taxed the country financially and necessitated a major organizational effort. Many absorption activists, Jewish Agency executives, and government officials opposed unlimited, nonselective immigration; they favored a gradual process geared to the country's absorptive capacity. Throughout this period, two charges resurfaced at every public debate: one, that the absorption process caused undue hardship; two, that Israel's immigration policy was misguided.\\" However, the force of Ben-Gurion's influence and insistence ensured that unrestricted immigration continued.: \\"On several occasions, resolutions were passed to limit immigration from European and Arab countries alike. However, these limits were never put into practice, mainly due to the opposition of Ben- Gurion. As a driving force in the emergency of the state, Ben-Gurion‚Äîboth prime minister and minister of defense‚Äîcarried enormous weight with his veto. His insistence on the right of every Jew to immigrate proved victorious. He would not allow himself to be swayed by financial or other considerations. It was he who orchestrated the large-scale action that enabled the Jews to leave Eastern Europe and Islamic countries, and it was he who effectively forged Israel's foreign policy. Through a series of clandestine activities carried out overseas by the Foreign Office, the Jewish Agency, the Mossad le-Aliyah, and the Joint Distribution Committee, the road was paved for mass immigration.\\" The plan has been described as \\"a pivotal event in ‚Äòimagining‚Äô the Jewish state\\" and \\"the moment when the category of Mizrahi Jews in the current sense of this term, as an ethnic group distinct from European-born Jews, was invented.\\" The large scale immigration in the first few years after Israel's declaration was the product of this policy change in favour of mass immigration focused on Jews from Arab and Muslim countries. Background At the 1942 Biltmore Conference, Ben-Gurion promoted the idea of two million Jews emigrating to Palestine in order to build the Jewish majority required to create the Jewish Commonwealth called for at the conference. It was assumed at the time that most of the immigrants would be Ashkenazi Jews. Ben-Gurion described his intentions to a meeting of experts and Jewish leaders: The Planning Committee Ben-Gurion had requested an initial analysis on the absorptive potential on the country in early 1941, and in late 1942 commissioned a \\"master plan\\" for the proposed immigration. He appointed a committee of experts, a Planning Committee, to explore how the economy of Mandatory Palestine could support a million new Jewish Immigrants. The Planning Committee (\\"◊ï◊¢◊ì◊™ ◊î◊™◊ô◊õ◊ï◊ü\\", also known as \\"The Committee of the Four\\"), was established in order to develop a blueprint and decide its guiding principles, and to create sub-committees of experts for various sectors, and supervise their work. Ben-Gurion believed that by choosing the members of the committee, he would be able to garner support both for the planning arrangements and their political aspects. Ben-Gurion was chairman of the committee, which also included Eliezer Kaplan, treasurer of the Jewish Agency, Eliezer Hoofien, Chairman of the Anglo-Palestine Bank, Emil Shmorek, head of the department of trade and industry at the Jewish Agency, and a three-person secretariat consisting of economists. The committee convened for the first time on October 11, 1943 at Kaplan's home, where the decision was taken to convene weekly at the Jewish Agency building in Jerusalem. Ben-Gurion participated regularly and examined the sub-committee reports in detail. The committee established sub-committees consisting of experts to examine the planning issues regarding development of land, water, settlement, industry, transportation, habitation, finance and more. The Planning Committee submitted reports throughout 1944 and the beginning of 1945. Among the first things discussed by the committee was the definition of its goals. Ben-Gurion declared two goals: 1. The settlement of two million Jews within 18 months, and the elaboration of a plan to facilitate such settlement, and 2. Scientific investigation of the facts related to such settlement, such as the quantity of water required, the nature of the soil, climate, and so on. The other members of the committee found the first goal unrealistic. Eventually Ben-Gurion relented and agreed to two plans. The \\"big\\" plan - rapid settlement of a million Jews and the creation of a Jewish majority and Jewish rule, and the \\"small\\" plan, the settlement of another million Jews within a few years. The plan The plan, envisioning the arrival of a million Jews over 18 months, was completed in summer 1944, providing details of transportation, refugee camps and the financing required. The plan was first presented to the Jewish Agency Executive on 24 June 1944, not as an operative plan since the British immigration restrictions were still in place at the time, but as a political plan to formulate the requirements of the Zionist Organization at the end of World War II. From 1944 onwards, the plan became the official policy of the Zionist leadership, and the immigration of Jews from Arab and Muslim countries became \\"explicit or implicit in all the declarations, testimonies, memoranda and demands issued by the Jewish Agency from World War ll until the establishment of the state\\". Ben-Gurion saw immigration as the top priority of the Zionist project, but was aware of the challenges of such a large-scale project, stating following the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War: > The main thing is absorption of immigrants. This embodies all the historical > needs of the state. We might have captured the West Bank, the Golan, the > entire Galilee, but those conquests would not have reinforced our territory > as much as immigration. Doubling and tripling the number of immigrants gives > us more and more strength....This is the most important thing above all > else. Settlement ‚Äì that is the real conquest.Segev, 1949, p97 The first organizational measure of the Plan was the late 1943 general plan of action entitled 'The Uniform Pioneer to the Eastern Lands', which would offer a course for emissaries from the Jewish Agency Immigration Department to later be sent Islamic countries.: Section \\"THE ONE MILLION PLAN AND THE OPERATIVE POLICY OF ZIONISM\\": \\"Making mass immigration from Islamic countries a political objective required preparations to ensure that the immigrants would actually come. In the course of Zionist activity during World War II, the Yishuv leaders had discovered that the Jews in these countries were not clamouring to emigrate, that there was no comprehensive Zionist activity there and that the Zionist cadre active there was extremely limited in scope and in its ability to have an impact... The first organizational measure was the Jewish Agency's decision to offer a course for emissaries who would then be posted to Islamic countries. In the second half of 1943, a general plan of action was drawn up. Entitled 'The Uniform Pioneer to the Eastern Lands', the plan proclaimed the concept of an ingathering of exiles and the revival of the Jewish people in Palestine as its central theme... To ensure implementation of the plan, it was decided that the emissaries would be sent out by the Jewish Agency Immigration Department and that it, not the Histadrut‚Äîas had been the case until then‚Äîwould be responsible for the enterprise... The Uniform Pioneer Plan set a precedent for the Zionist movement's patronizing attitude toward its adherents in the Islamic countries and later in Israel. These activities in Islamic countries lost their urgency and attraction after WWII, and the boost in resources they received dwindled. The number of activists in these countries was minuscule compared to Europe, and there were not even enough of them to maintain what was already established. Immigration candidates Investigating sources of immigrants and their scope figured prominently in the deliberations of the Planning Commission. They were presented with much data - the distribution and number of Jews in each country, including population changes during World War II, and analysis of the economic and occupational opportunities in these communities. Using this data, the composition the million immigrants that would come to the country was arrived at. Three main groups were initially considered as candidates for immediate immigration: Jewish Holocaust survivors in Axis countries--about 535,000 people; WWII refugees in neutral and Allied countries, of which an estimated 30% would want to immigrate--247,000; An estimated 20% of the Jewish population of Islamic countries--150,000. The possibility of a smaller number of people from the first groups was taken into consideration, in which case there would be more immigrants from the third group. In mid-1944, as the extent of the Holocaust became known, focusing of attention on potential immigration from Muslim countries began. The main focus of the plan was Jews from Iraq, Syria, Turkey, Iran, and Yemen.: \\"The plan also entailed bringing Jews from Europe, but its main focus (roughly three-quarters of the potential immigrants) was on Jews from Iraq, Syria, Turkey, Iran, and Yemen. For the first time, the Jews in Islamic countries were introduced into the political discussion of the Jewish institutions as a single category (called \\"Sephardim,\\" \\"Edot Ha'Mizrah,\\" or \\"Mizrahim\\", depending on time and context).\\": \\"Jews residing in Arab countries were increasingly marked as candidates for mass immigration and thus became the focus of discourse about the absorption of immigrants... Ben-Gurion formulated an ambitious plan to bring one million Jews to Palestine after the war, and he zeroed in on the Jews from Middle Eastern and North African countries as the most promising candidates for immigration.\\" As the scale of the Holocaust became clearer, the share of Jews from Arab and Muslim countries in the plan was increased. In July 1943, Eliyahu Dobkin, the head of the Jewish Agency's immigration department, presented a map of the estimated 750,000 Jews in Islamic countries, and noted that: > ‚Ä¶many of the Jews in Europe will perish in the Holocaust and the Jews of > Russia are locked in. Therefore, the quantitative value of these three- > quarters of a million Jews has risen to the level of a highly valuable > political factor within the framework of world Jewry. The primary task we > face is to rescue this Jewry, [and] the time has come to mount an assault on > this Jewry for a Zionist conquest. Similarly, Ben-Gurion stated at a meeting of the Jewish Agency Executive on 28 September 1944 that \\"My minimum used to be two million: now that we have been annihilated l say one million\\". On 30 July 1945, Ben-Gurion stated in his diary: One of the issues that came up during discussions of the One Million Plan was the security of Jewish communities in Islamic countries. In a 1943 Mapai central committee speech, Eliyahu Dobkin stated his view that the creation of Israel in Arab Palestine will create danger for Jews living in other Arab countries. and Ben-Gurion wrote at a similar time of \\"the catastrophe that the Jews in eastern lands are expected to face as a result of Zionism\\", although these gloomy forecasts proved false. Policies were put in place to enhance Zionist activity in the target countries to ensure the immigrants would come. Esther Meir-Glitzenstein notes that \\"Interestingly, Ben-Gurion cites political and rational reasons for bringing Jewish displaced persons from Europe, whereas in discussing the immigration of the Jews from Islamic countries he mentions not only a political and rational reason, but also a cultural-orientalist explanation, since the 'degeneration' of the East was one of the basic elements of this perception.\\" Following establishment of Israel Implementation of a significant part of the One Million Plan's plans and recommendations took place in the newly-established State of Israel, following its creation of in 1948. This included mass Aliyah, the setting up of Immigrant camps and Ma'abarot, the Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany, the National Water Carrier of Israel and the National Outline Plan. As a result of the withdrawal of British forces and the declaration of the State of Israel in May 1948, the immigration restrictions to the country were removed, making it possible to implement the policy changes relating to large-scale Aliyah focused on Jews from Arab and Muslim countries. Ben Gurion's government subsequently presented the Knesset with a plan to double the population of 600,000 within four years. This immigration policy had some opposition within the new Israeli government, such as those who argued that there was \\"no justification for organizing large-scale emigration among Jews whose lives were not in danger, particularly when the desire and motivation were not their own\\" as well as those who argued that the absorption process caused \\"undue hardship\\". However, the force of Ben-Gurion's influence and insistence ensured that unrestricted immigration continued. According to Dr Irit Katz, the ma'abarot camps were the product of the One Million Plan.: \\"These camps did not merely appear due to a state of emergency of the increasing stream of immigrants; instead, they were a product of an existing detailed plan, the One Million Plan, consolidated between 1942 and 1945 in order to absorb one million Jewish immigrants a few years before Israel's establishment‚Ä¶ Camps were an integral part of the One Million Plan‚Ä¶ However, three years after its completion, the One Million Plan approached realisation following the Israeli declaration of independence in May 1948 and the decision to open the state‚Äôs gates to Jewish immigration. As planned and anticipated, the camp had gradually become a central instrument in the absorption process. Several small immigrant camps operated before statehood in the centre of the country, and in accordance with the One Million Plan, about 30 additional camps opened in former British military facilities.\\" Dr Roy Kozlovsky notes that the prior existence of the One Million Plan suggests that \\"the concept of the ma'abara was in fact the precondition for, not the effect of, mass immigration\\".: \\"To contain the risks of mass immigration, Ben Gurion commissioned a group of experts to prepare the \\"Million Plan,\\" which included a complete design for a system of camps to house the influx of refugees until they could be settled and employed. The plan was elaborated with great detail, even calculating the caloric value of the meals that were to be prepared in the camps' kitchens.\\" The existence of the \\"Million Plan\\" requires us to reevaluate the way in which the story of the ma'abaras has been told, since it now appears that the concept of the ma'abara was in fact the precondition for, not the effect of, mass immigration.\\" Dr Piera Rossetto described the debate around the conditions of the Ma'abarot, stating her opinion that \\"the most controversial issue in this respect is not the outcome (e.g. the ma‚Äôabarot) of the choice, rather the choice in itself to bring to Israel so many thousands of immigrants, following the idea of the ‚ÄúOne Million Plan‚Äù unveiled by Ben Gurion in 1944\\".: \\"It could be argued that the State of Israel, before and immediately after its declaration, was going through such hardships that there were no many other options to ‚Äúabsorb‚Äù so many thousands of immigrants arriving to the Country than by placing them in these precarious hosting facilities. Nonetheless, I am of the opinion that the most controversial issue in this respect is not the outcome (e.g. the ma‚Äôabarot) of the choice, rather the choice in itself to bring to Israel so many thousands of immigrants, following the idea of the ‚ÄúOne Million Plan‚Äù unveiled by Ben Gurion in 1944.\\" References Bibliography      * In Hebrew: Category:1944 in Mandatory Palestine Category:June 1944 events Category:20th- century Judaism Category:Action plans Category:Aliyah Category:History of the Jews in the Middle East Category:Immigration to Israel Category:Jewish Agency for Israel Category:Mandatory Palestine in World War II ","title":"One Million Plan"},{"id":"42800454","title":"Deepan Sivaraman"},{"id":"42800456","text":"Kemal Aydƒ±n (19 January 1934 - 8 January 2019) was a former Turkish football player.

Chen joined the Anhui clique after Yuan's death in June 1916. In 1917 he was opposed by Hu Jingyi, a former supporter, for his opposition to the Constitutional Protection Movement. Chen made peace with Hu after Hu tried to seek assistance from Yu Youren, who was acting on behalf of the southern government opposed to Beiyang.

History A Poland-Ukraine border first formed, briefly, in the aftermath of the Polish‚ÄìUkrainian War in 1919. The Treaty of Warsaw of 1920 divided the disputed territories in Poland's favor along the Zbruch River. Next year, however, Ukraine lost its independence to the Soviet Union, and its remaining territories were split between Poland and the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in the Peace of Riga. Following the signing of Ribbentrop-Molotov agreement and invasion of Poland by the Soviet Union, vast territories in eastern Poland were annexed to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. The new border was short-lived as Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union. In 1945 following the end of the war and the establishment of the Polish People's Republic a new border was formed between the Ukrainian SSR and Poland with Poland losing vast territories in Ukraine's favor, including the city of Lviv. During the negotiations on the Polish‚ÄìSoviet border agreement of August 1945, alongside the Polish-Ukrainian section of the border the Polish side proposal was categorically rejected. Due to this, the Polish side proposed a more modest changes, namely to transfer the railway junction in Khyriv (Polish: Chyr√≥w) to Poland, in which two parallel main lines of national importance were connected. At the same time, Rava-Ruska was requested. In this town, located near the Curzon Line, three Polish railway lines and one Ukrainian converged. Polish requests were completely rejected, only managed to slightly shift the border to the east near Przemy≈õl, Korczowa and Horyniec-Zdr√≥j. The Soviets also agreed to let Medyka to be on the Polish side. The Bieszczady County was also obtained, thanks to the efforts of Stanis≈Çaw Leszczycki during the negotiations, covering about 300 square km with Halicz and Tarnica peaks.Mateusz Podkul.

It was released on 2 June 2014 through frontman Justin Broadrick's own record label, Avalanche Recordings. The EP is the second release by Godflesh since Hymns (2001), following the 2013 single \\"F.O.D. (Fuck of Death)\\". It precedes the group's seventh studio album, A World Lit Only by Fire (2014), and the two were recorded in the same sessions. The track \\"Ringer\\" was released for streaming in May 2014 on the band's SoundCloud account. Background and composition When mixing began for Godflesh's return studio album, A World Lit Only by Fire, Broadrick found that there was more material than he wanted to include on a single release. To keep the album under an hour, he cut the more \\"colorful\\" and \\"dynamic\\" outlying tracks and combined them to create Decline & Fall. In a 2014 interview with the French publication La Grosse Radio, Broadrick spoke about the value of the EP format, explaining that it allows for more experimentation because the general public doesn't consider it as important as a studio album release. Decline & Fall and the following album feature extensive use of an eight-string guitar. The guitar, a signature model, was provided to Broadrick by Blakhart. On the use of this instrument, Broadrick stated: Musically, Decline & Fall is a heavy industrial metal release with extremely distorted, low and repetitive guitar work layered over similarly distorted bass from G. C. Green and Godflesh's signature drum machine beats. The EP marked a return to the group's mechanical percussion after 2001's Hymns, which featured live drumming by Ted Parsons. Decline & Fall is intentionally dissonant and rough; Zoe Camp of Pitchfork wrote that the production of the EP could be heard as a response to the sanitation of industrial music, saying that \\"Godflesh remain fiercely loyal to lo-fi, treating songs as caustic exercises in overstimulation.\\" Critical reception Decline and Fall was met with positive reviews. Zoe Camp of Pitchfork gave the EP a positive review, writing, \\"Avant and yet strangely accessible, industrially-minded but all-embracing, Decline & Fall confirms that a decade-plus-long absence has dulled neither Godflesh‚Äôs industrial spirit, nor their devotion to experimentation.\\" Gregory Heany of AllMusic described the EP as \\"sludgy, grime-covered industrial metal that feels like a promising preview for their first post-breakup full-length, A World Lit Only by Fire.\\" Maya Kalev of Resident Advisor wrote, \\"Even when it seems like Godflesh are re-treading old ground, the effect is never less than thrilling.\\" Decline & Fall drew favorable comparisons to early Godflesh releases, like their 1988 self-titled EP and their debut album, Streetcleaner (1989).

As a bishop of Iconium, modern Konya, in central Anatolia, he was involved with the issue of the creation of the Turkish Orthodox Church. He died in Turkish prison in 1923. He is commemorated by the Greek Orthodox Church as Hieromartyr () and his feast day is celebrated on the Sunday before the Exaltation of the Holy Cross each year (September 7‚Äì13). Life Prokopios Lazaridis was born in Tyana, in Konya Province in 1859. He attended the Halki Seminary in Constantinople (Istanbul) at 1875. In 1899 he became Metropolitan of Dyrrachium (modern Durr√´s in central Albania), where he developed significant activity among the local Orthodox communities. In 1906 he was installed in the Anatolian city of Philadelpha (Ala≈üehir, Asia Minor), as the head of the local bishopric. In 1911 he became metropolitan bishop of Iconium, in central Anatolia. During the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922), the nationalist Turkish authorities in an attempt to Turkify and take the Orthodox church under their full control, founded the Turkish Orthodox Church in Kayseri and installed Papa Eftim as its head. Prokopios was against these developments and tried to reach a solution concerning the administration of the Orthodox Church in Anatolia. In September 20, 1920, as a result of his intervention, Prokopios, as well as the local Armenian bishop of Konya, were imprisoned by the nationalist authorities of Mustafa Kemal. Prokopios then was transferred to the prison of Erzurum, and stayed there from October 1920 to May 1922. Soon after his release, he visited Ankara, where he met Mustafa Kemal in an attempt to ask him to abstain from the ecclesiastical dispute concerning the creation of the Turkish Orthodox Patriarchate, due to severe health problems he suffered. Nevertheless, his proposal was rejected. Prokopios presided in the following ecclesiastical council at January 1923, where he was obliged to proclaim the Turkish Orthodox Church. However, Turkish interests subsided, due to the Greek defeat in Anatolia and the subsequent deportation of the Greek Orthodox communities from Anatolia. Prokopios was again imprisoned and died in detention in April 1923 in Kayseri prison.

Set over 15 acres, since opening as a visitor's centre in 1992, the old distillery has received approximately 100,000 guests per year, receiving 125,000 in 2015. The Old Midleton Distillery in which the Jameson Experience is located began life as a woollen mill, before being converted to a military barracks and subsequently a distillery in 1825. The distillery operated until 1975, when a new distillery was constructed alongside it to house the consolidated operations of three former whiskey-making rivals, John Jameson & Son, John Powers & Son, and Cork Distilleries Company (owners of the Midlelton Distillery), who had come together to form Irish Distillers in 1966. It now houses a visitor centre, a restaurant, and a gift shop. As of January 2017, adult tickets cost ‚Ç¨18 and include a Jameson Signature Drink. Tours take approximately 75 minutes and are scheduled according to the season.  History  A 31,618 gallon pot still, the largest ever built, once operated at the distillery. No longer in use, it can still be seen inside the old still room. A smaller pot still sits outside the visitor centre. On 20 May 1796, Marcus Lynch leased land from Viscount Midleton, and having obtained rights to use the waters of the Dungourney River, Lynch in partnership with two London merchants, erected a large woollen mill. Lynch later became the sole owner of the premises following the bankruptcy of his partners. In 1803, during the Napoleonic Wars, this mill was purchased by the Government for ¬£20,000 and converted for uses as a barracks and stables, though part of the premises was leased back to Lynch. Eighteen years later, with both Lynch and the barracks gone, the Government sold the building to Lord Midleton's brother, the Archbishop of Cashel, for ¬£1,750, a steep discount on what they had paid for it. When the Archbishop died in 1824, Lord Midleton bought the property for the same price. On 20 December 1825, Lord Midleton sold the property for ¬£4,000 to three brothers, James, Daniel and Jeremiah Murphy, who hoped to convert it for use as a distillery, the 1823 Excise Act having made distillation far more financially attractive. The Murphys invested a considerable sum in establishing a large distilling operation at the site, which was to become known as James Murphy and Company. A large undershot timber water wheel was installed to help power the distillery (which was replaced in 1852, by an iron water wheel which survives on-site to this day). In addition, a mammoth 31,618 gallon pot still was constructed at the distillery which remains the largest ever built. The pot still was so large, that it needed to be assembled on-site with the distillery built around it. The ambition of the Murphys (and the effect of the 1823 excise reforms) is underlined by the fact that just two years earlier, the largest pot still in Ireland had a capacity of just 750 gallons. In 1827, Murphy's distillery is reported to have produced over 188,000 proof gallons of spirit, and by the 1830s, distillery output had risen further, to 400,000 proof gallons per annum, with the distillery having a payroll of nearly 200. An iron waterwheel, installed in 1852, was used to drive malt grinding stones at the distillery. In the mid-1800s, the Irish whiskey industry underwent a period of turmoil, with temperance movement of the 1830s, and the Great Famine of the 1840s reducing domestic demand for whiskey. At the time, Cork was home to several distilleries, therefore, in the 1860s, James Murphy (head of the company, and son of the founder), suggested amalgamating the operations of several local distilleries. The other distilleries agreed, so in 1867, Cork Distilleries Company (CDC) was formed, with Murphy at the helm. In 1867, CDC took control of four Cork distilleries: North Mall, The Green, Watercourse and Daly's, and a year later Midleton Distillery joined the fold. The Midleton Distillery, as it looked when Alfred Barnard visited in 1886. In 1886, Alfred Barnard, a British historian visited the distillery, describing its location close to both rail and water carriage, amidst large corn-growing country as a desirable location to establish a distillery. In addition to the 31,618 gallon wash still, Barnard stated that the distillery boasted two 10,000 gallon spirits stills, and unusually for an Irish distillery at the time, a Coffey Still. The distillery, which was lit by gas, was reported to have an output in excess of 1,000,000 gallons per annum, and to produce a whiskey known as \\"The Cork Whisky Make\\". In later years, whiskey from the distillery was known as Cork Distilleries Company Old Irish Whisky, before becoming known as simply \\"Paddy\\". In the years that followed Barnard's visit, the Irish whiskey industry entered a period of decline, with Irish whiskey losing significant market share due to a variety of events. These included, the rise of blended Scotch whisky, Prohibition in the United States, the Anglo-Irish trade war (which locked Irish exports out of the British Empire). When Alfred Barnard visited Ireland, there were 28 distilleries in operation, however, by the 1960s, only a handful of these remained in operation. In 1966 three of these (John Jameson & Son, John Powers & Son and Cork Distilleries Company) chose to amalgamate their operations under the name of Irish Distillers and to close their existing facilities, and concentrate their operations in a new purpose- built facility to be constructed alongside the existing distillery in Midleton. In July 1975, operations ceased at the Old Midleton Distillery and began anew the next day at the New Midleton Distillery, with the Jameson Bow Street Distillery and Powers John's Lane Distillery shutting a year later. As a result, the new distillery, is now home to many Irish whiskeys such as Jameson, Powers, Paddy, Redbreast, Green Spot, previously produced in separate distilleries. In 1992, the Old Midleton Distillery reopened as a visitor's centre, known as the Jameson Experience. = Connection with Murphy's Stout = Murphy's Brewery, known for producing Murphy's Irish Stout, was established by two younger members of the Murphy family who left the distillery business to strike out on their own in brewing in the 1850s. Visitor attractions The Jameson Experience, Midleton tour explains the history of Jameson Whiskey and the distillery that operated before it was produced there. Tours include a film, and walking tour, in which guests are guided through the old distillery, where they can admire the old kilns, mills, maltings, water wheel, still house, distiller's cottage, cooperage and warehouses. Small numbers of visitors can also volunteer to participate in a taste test, comparing Jameson Whiskey, Scotch whisky, and American whiskey, to become a \\"Qualified Irish Whiskey Taster\\".

In 1913 he co-directed the biopic ' (1913).Abel p.260 In 1915 he directed The Tunnel the first adaptation of Bernhard Kellermann's science fiction novel Der Tunnel. His birthplace is now the Wauer Museum. Life He was born in Oberwiesenthal on 26 October 1866 the son of a Lutheran minister, Canon Johann Carl Ernst Wauer and his wife Katharine Knobloch. He went to school in Dresden and Halle then attended the Academy of Art first in Dresden then in Berlin and Munich. He then travelled to America where he studied in San Francisco and New York for two years. He then returned to Germany to study Philosophy and Art History at the University of Leipzig. From 1888 he worked as an art critic for the magazine \\"XX Jahrhundert\\" (20th Century). When radio came to Germany he began working in this field and began film-making in 1911. His work was part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1928 Summer Olympics. The Nazis declared both his film and his sculpture as \\"degenerate art\\" putting an immediate end to both activities. Although he was allowed to continue these pursuits from 1945, the post-war spirit and economy did not embrace this, and the long break and huge changes in the new post-war world meant he did not resume his art to any meaningful degree. He did one portrait in this later period, an oil painting of Karl Hofer in 1947. In 1949 he saw the creation of West Berlin as a western enclave within an otherwise communist regime, and in 1961 he was one of the many Berliners encircled by the Berlin Wall. He died in West Berlin on 10 March 1962 and is buried in the Forest Cemetery in the Dahlem district. The grave is identified as a \\"grave of honour of the City of Berlin\\" exempting it from the German practice of erasing graves if relatives fail to maintain payments for upkeep.

He was elected in three successive periods from 1908 to 1918. In 1921 he was among the notables of the Greek community of the Pontus region who were hanged by the Turkish nationalists of Mustafa Kemal. Early life and political career Kofidis was born in the √áorum Province, today in modern Turkey.Karachristos, 2002 He moved to Trebizond, northeastern Turkey, where he became a member of the local tobacco monopoly. Kofidis was elected as a member of the Ottoman parliament for the Trebizond Vilayet in three successive election periods: 1908-1912, 1912-1914, and 1914-1918\\\\. Initially, he participated in the Young Turk movement. Kofidis, along with a number of Christian Orthodox citizens of the Ottoman Empire, hoped that this movement would favor the various local ethnoreligious groups. However, they soon realized that the ultimate goal of the Young Turks was the imposition of various policies of ethnic cleansing and genocide, which they launched during the following years. Kofidis represented a district that was severely affected by the ethnic cleansing policies. He became one of the Greek representatives in the Ottoman parliament who vigorously protested and demanded strict measures to stop the ongoing genocide. Under these circumstances, Kofidis tried to handle the situation carefully and negotiated with the Ottoman authorities whenever possible.Photiades, 1985: 285-286 In 1917 Kofidis replaced for a short period the Orthodox bishop of Trebizond, Chrysanthus, in his non-religious duties. In 1920, he refused to lead an armed guerrilla struggle in Pontus, in fear that this would cause the destruction of Trebizond by the Turkish national movement.Clark, 2006: 112 Execution In mid-1921 a large part of the local Orthodox Christian male population was deported and sent to labour battalions in Erzerum. Kofidis' son was killed during his deportation. During this time, an \\"Ad Hoc Court of Turkish Independence\\" in Amasya, which was controlled by the Turkish nationalists of Mustafa Kemal (later Atat√ºrk), sentenced Kofidis to death by hanging. Kofidis was hanged in Amasya. The same court sentenced to death several notable figures of the local Greek community, especially politicians, businessmen, and religious personalities.Vergeti, 1993: 77 All were accused of participating in the establishment of the Republic of Pontus.

Origins and early career  Coin of Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad. Husain was a native of Gurziwan in Guzgan, and was the son of Kharmil, a military officer of the Ghurids who played an important role during Ala al-Din Husayn's war against the Ghaznavid ruler Bahram-Shah. Husain is first mentioned in sources as one of the leaders of the Ghurid incursions into India. In 1185/6, Sultan Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad appointed Husain as the governor of Sialkot, a city in northern Punjab. Later in 1194, Husain, along with another Ghurid general named Qutb-ud-din Aibak, were the leaders of a raid in the eastern part of the Indus-Gangetic Plain. During the raid, they decisively defeated the Narayan ruler. In ca. 1198, Husain, along with the Ghurid prince Nasir al-Din Muhammad Kharnak, ambushed a Kara-Khitan army, which had previously plundered the northern part of the Ghurid Empire. In 1202, Mu'izz's brother and co-ruler, the Ghurid supreme leader Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad, died of illness, and was succeeded by his Mu'izz as the leader of the Ghurid dynasty. Shortly after Ghiyath's death, however, the Khwarazmian-shah Muhammad II invaded the Ghurid Empire, and besieged Herat. Mu'izz, along with Husain, quickly managed to Muhammad from Herat and then pursued him to Khwarezm, where the Ghurid army besieged the Khwarazmian capital of Gurganj. However, Muhammad out of despair requested aid from the Kara-Khitan Khanate, who sent an army to aid Muhammad. Mu'izz, because of harassment from the Kara-Khitans, was forced to relieve the siege and retreat his army back to Ghur, his homeland. However, the Ghurid army was later ambushed by the Khwarazmians, and was defeated at Andkhud in 1204. Although many of the Ghurid troops were killed during the battle, Mu'izz managed to escape, and Husain, along with his 5,000 private soldiers, also managed to escape. Husain was later appointed as the governor of Herat and Talaqan.  Establishment of authority and death  After the death of Mu'izz in 1206, the Ghurid Empire rapidly declined. During the same period, Husain declared independence from the Ghurids, and began strengthening the defenses of Herat. However, in 1208, Muhammad re-invaded the Ghurid Empire, and forced Husain to acknowledge Khwarazmian suzerainty. However, while Muhammad was penetrating deeper into Ghurid territory, he was defeated and captured by the Kara-Khitans, which gave Husain the opportunity to secretly negotiate with the Ghurid ruler Ghiyath al-Din Mahmud. However, the negotiation turned fruitless, and Ghiyath sent an army against Husain, which, was, however, defeated. Meanwhile, Muhammad, who distrusted Husain, sent Izz al-Din Jaldik to supervise Herat, but secretly ordered Jaldik to have Husain executed; Jaldik shortly had Husain arrested, but Husain's vizier Khwaja al-Sahib quickly raised a resistance against the Khwarazmians, and changed his allegiance to the Ghurids. Jaldik then threatened Khwaja al-Sahib by killing Husain if he did not stop the resistance. Khwaja, however, kept resisting Jaldik, who shortly had Husain killed.

The Breit‚ÄìWheeler process or Breit‚ÄìWheeler pair production is a physical process in which a positron‚Äìelectron pair is created from the collision of two photons. It is the simplest mechanism by which pure light can be potentially transformed into matter. The process can take the form Œ≥ Œ≥‚Ä≤ ‚Üí e+ e‚àí where Œ≥ and Œ≥‚Ä≤ are two light quanta. The multiphoton Breit‚ÄìWheeler process, also referred to as nonlinear Breit‚ÄìWheeler or strong field Breit‚ÄìWheeler in the literature, is the extension of the pure photon‚Äìphoton Breit‚ÄìWheeler process when a high-energy probe photon decays into pairs propagating through an electromagnetic field (for example, a laser pulse). In contrast with the previous process, this one can take the form of Œ≥ + n œâ ‚Üí e+ e‚àí, where œâ represents the coherent photons of the laser field. The inverse process, e+ e‚àí ‚Üí Œ≥ Œ≥‚Ä≤, in which an electron and a positron collide and annihilate to generate a pair of gamma photons, is known as electron‚Äìpositron annihilation or the Dirac process for the name of the physicist who first described it theoretically and anticipated the Breit‚ÄìWheeler process. This mechanism is theoretically characterized by a very weak probability, so producing a significant number of pairs requires two extremely bright, collimated sources of photons having photon energy close or above the electron and positron rest mass energy. Manufacturing such a source, a gamma-ray laser, is still a technological challenge. In many experimental configurations, pure Breit‚ÄìWheeler is dominated by other more efficient pair creation processes that screen pairs produced via this mechanism. The Dirac process (pair annihilation) has nonetheless been by far verified experimentally. This is also the case for the multiphoton Breit‚ÄìWheeler, which was observed at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in 1997 by colliding a high-energy electrons with a counter-propagating terawatt laser pulse. Although this mechanism is still one of the most difficult to be observed experimentally on Earth, it is of considerable importance for the absorption of high-energy photons travelling cosmic distances. The photon‚Äìphoton and the multiphoton Breit‚ÄìWheeler processes are described theoretically by the theory of quantum electrodynamics. History The photon‚Äìphoton Breit‚ÄìWheeler process was described theoretically by Gregory Breit and John A. Wheeler in 1934 in Physical Review. It followed previous theoretical work of Paul Dirac on antimatter and pair annihilation. In 1928, Paul Dirac's work proposed that electrons could have positive and negative energy states following the framework of relativistic quantum theory but did not explicitly predict the existence of a new particle. Experimental observations =Photon‚Äìphoton Breit‚ÄìWheeler possible experimental configurations= Although the process is one of the manifestations of the mass‚Äìenergy equivalence, as of 2017, the pure Breit‚ÄìWheeler has never been observed in practice because of the difficulty in preparing colliding gamma ray beams and the very weak probability of this mechanism. Recently, different teams have proposed novel theoretical studies on possible experimental configurations to finally observe it on Earth. In 2014, physicists at Imperial College London proposed a relatively simple way to physically demonstrate the Breit‚ÄìWheeler process. The collider experiment that the physicists proposed involves two key steps. First, they would use an extremely powerful high-intensity laser to accelerate electrons to nearly the speed of light. They would then fire these electrons into a slab of gold to create a beam of photons a billion times more energetic than those of visible light. The next stage of the experiment involves a tiny gold can called a hohlraum (German for 'empty room'). Scientists would fire a high-energy laser at the inner surface of this hohlraum to create a thermal radiation field. They would then direct the photon beam from the first stage of the experiment through the centre of the hohlraum, causing the photons from the two sources to collide and form electrons and positrons. It would then be possible to detect the formation of the electrons and positrons when they exited the can. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that this technique is capable of producing of the order of 105 Breit‚ÄìWheeler pairs in a single shot. In 2016, a second novel experimental setup has been proposed and studied theoretically in to demonstrate and study the Breit‚ÄìWheeler process. They propose to collide two high-energy photon sources (composed of non-coherent hard x-ray and gamma-ray photons) generated from the interaction of two extremely-intense lasers on solid thin foils or gas jets. With the forthcoming generations of short-pulse extremely intense lasers, laser interaction with solid target will be the place of strong radiative effects driven by the nonlinear inverse quantum scattering. This effect, negligible so far, will become a dominant cooling mechanism for the extremely relativistic electrons accelerated above the 100-MeV level at the laser-solid interface via different mechanisms. =Multiphoton Breit‚ÄìWheeler experiments= The multiphoton Breit‚ÄìWheeler has already been observed and studied experimentally. One of the most efficient configurations to maximize the multiphoton Breit‚ÄìWheeler pair production consists on colliding head-on a bunch of gamma photon with a counter- propagating (or with a slight collision angle, the co-propagating configuration being the less efficient configuration) ultra-high intensity laser pulse. To first create the photons and then have the pair production in an all-in-one setup, the similar configuration can be used by colliding giga- electronvolt (GeV) electrons. Depending on the laser intensity, these electrons will first radiate gamma photons via the so-called nonlinear inverse Compton scattering mechanism when interacting with the laser pulse. Still interacting with the laser, the photons then turn into multiphoton Breit‚ÄìWheeler electron-positron pairs. This method has been considered In 1997 at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Researchers were able to conduct the multiphoton Breit‚ÄìWheeler process using electrons to first create high- energy photons, which then underwent multiple collisions to produce electrons and positrons, all within same chamber. Electrons were accelerated in the linear accelerator to an energy of 46.6 GeV before being sent head-on to a Neodymium (Nd:glass) lineary polarized laser of intensity 1018 W/cm2 (maximal electric field amplitude of around 6√ó109 V/m), of wavelength 527 nanometers and duration 1.6 picoseconds. In this configurations, it has been estimated that photons of energy up to 29 GeV were generated. This led to the yield of 106 ¬±14 positrons with a broad energy spectrum in the GeV level (peak around 13 GeV). The latter experiment may be reproduced in the future at SLAC with more powerful present laser technologies. The use of higher laser intensities (1020 W/cm2 is now easily achievable with turnkey short-pulse titanium- sapphire laser solutions) would significantly enhance process efficiencies (inverse nonlinear Compton and nonlinear Breit‚ÄìWheeler pair creation) leading to higher antimatter production at several orders of magnitude. It could enable to perform high-resolution measurements as well as to characterize additional mass-shift, nonlinear and spin effects. The extreme intensities expected to be available on the upcoming multi-petawatt laser systems will allow all-optical, laser-electron collision schemes. In an all-optical configuration, the electron beam is generated from the laser interaction with a gas jet in the so-called laser wakefield acceleration regime. The electron bunch is made to interact with a second high-power laser in order to study QED processes. The feasibility of an all-optical multiphoton Breit‚ÄìWheeler pair production scheme has been first demonstrated theoretically in. This scheme is therefore restricted to multi-beam short-pulse extreme-intensity laser facilities, as will be the case of the CILEX-Apollon and ELI systems (CPA titanium sapphire technology at 0.8 micrometer, duration of 15-30 femtoseconds). The generation of electron beams of few GeV and few nano- Coulomb is possible with a first laser of 1 petawatt combined with the use of tuned and optimized gas-jet density profiles such as two-step profiles. Strong pair generation can be achieved by colliding head-on this electron beam with a second laser of intensity above 1022 W/cm2. In this configuration at this level of intensity, theoretical studies predict that several hundreds of pico- Coulombs of antimatter could be produced. This experimental setup could even be one of the most prolific positron yield factory. This all-optical scenario may be preliminary tested with lower laser intensities of the order of 1021 W/cm2.

He is now is a businessman running a cable television service in a rural area. He is married to Seetha (Navya Nair) and they have two daughters, Sindhu (Swaroopini Narayan), a Plus Two student, and Shreya (Unnathi), a student of class sixth. His only interest apart from his family is watching films. He spends most of his time in front of the TV in his small office. During a nature camp, Sindhu gets photographed in the bathroom by a hidden cell phone. The culprit, Tarun (Rohith B.), is the son of Inspector General of Police Roopa Chandrashekar (Asha Sarath). Tarun is accidentally killed by Seetha and her daughter when he comes to blackmail them using the clip either any one of them should sleep with him or he will surely publish the clip through Internet. They hide his body in a compost pit, which is witnessed by Shreya. Seetha tells Rajendra about the incident and he devises a way to save his family from the law. He removes the broken cell phone and disposes of Tarun's car, which is seen by a police constable, Suryaprakash (Achyuth Kumar), who has a grudge against Rajendra. Rajendra takes his family on a trip to attend a religious meeting, watch a movie and eat at a restaurant. Roopa, realising that her son has gone missing starts an investigation. After a preliminary investigation, Roopa calls Rajendra and family for questioning. Rajendra had predicted that this would happen and taught his family how to change their alibi at the time of murder. When questioned individually, they reply the same thing and they had also shown the bill of the restaurant, the movie tickets and the bus journeys' tickets as proof of their alibi. Roopa questions the owners of the establishments they have been to and their statements prove Rajendra's alibi. Roopa realises that on the day of the incident, Rajendra had taken the tickets and the bill, made acquaintance with the owners and had gone for the trip with his family the next day, thus proving his alibi and making the owners unwittingly tell the lie. Roopa arrests Rajendra and family and Suryaprakash uses brute force to beat the truth out of them. Eventually, Shreya gives in and reveals the place where the body is buried. After digging the compost pit, they find the carcass of a calf, indicating that Rajendra had moved the body. Shreya reports to the media and complains against Suryaprakash. The constable is suspended and Roopa resigns from her post. Roopa and her husband meet Rajendra to ask forgiveness for their rude and violent behavior. Rajendra suspects there might be foul play involved and still does not reveal directly that his family has committed a crime. Rajendra, now in remand, signs a register at the newly constructed local police station. As he leaves, a flashback shows him leaving the incomplete police station with a shovel in hand, indicating that he has hidden Tarun's body in the foundations of the very police station that dealt with the said investigation.

The property captures the adaptive alteration of early farmsteads and industrial properties to more recreational purpose. The house was built by Hezekiah Hamblet, and acquired in 1808 by Eliphalet Putnam, who operated what is now called Frye's Measure Mill, located just east of this property, as well as the millworks on this land.

He was a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist revolutionary leader. On 30 March 1972, he was killed in an ambush by Turkish Military Forces with nine of the other members of THKP-C and THKO in Kƒ±zƒ±ldere village. Biography √áayan studied in Haydarpa≈üa high school and at the school of political sciences of Ankara University. He then became a member of Workers Party of Turkey and a leader of youth movement. He initially supported the idea of National Democratic Revolution but later changed this view. He admired Guevarist guerilla groups in Latin America (Tupamaros), and he created a strategy which was called people's revolution and democratic revolution. He and 10 friends abducted three NATO technicians from the √únye radar base, and demanded that Deniz Gezmi≈ü and his colleagues should not be executed. They were hiding in a country house in Kƒ±zƒ±ldere when they were discovered and surrounded by pursuing soldiers, and all including the hostages, except for Ertuƒürul K√ºrk√ß√º, were killed in the ensuing firefight. Mahir √áayan was a Vanguardist and a revolution theorist. He developed the theory of artificial balance which occurs between the oligarchy and the nation during the last crisis of imperialism.  Theory of Artificial Balance  The theory of artificial balance (Turkish: Suni Denge) was developed by Mahir √áayan a Turkish Marxist‚ÄìLeninist revolutionary leader. According to √áayan, there is an artificial balance between the dissatisfaction of the nation and the oligarchy. This contradiction between the oligarchy and the nation is the main one (German:Hauptwiderspruch) in a backward country. The main cause of this contradiction is Yankee Imperialism. Yankee Imperialism has developed a Neo- Colonialism Method after 1946. The main subject/goal of this method (resp. politics) is to minimize the problems of ‚Äúhigher-level‚Äù imperialism more satisfactorily. A method that provides having bigger market share with less expenses, more systematic/organized, and does not cause new national wars. The variance in consolidation of the capital outflow and the transfer is the main order. A new ratio/correlation is created among five or six elements of the capital. Namely, before the II. World War, the cash capital outflow had more allotment in comparison with the name and the patent rights of capital, the spare parts, the technical knowledge, the technical staff as etc. in total elements. After the war, especially after 1960, the process became reversed and the other elements, except for the cash capital outflow, had more allotment. Today in the backward countries, the allotment of the foreign cash capital is quite less than the national/domestic cash capital but there are many industrial enterprises certain foreign-dependent. On the one hand, Neo- Colonialism Method leads to the ‚Äúpermanent settlement‚Äù of imperialism in a country. On the other hand, in comparison with the previous periods (pre- colonialism period, feudalism was effective) this method raises the social production and the relative welfare to certain degrees in parallel with expanding market in the backward countries. As a consequence, the contradictions (as against in feudal period) seem to be ‚Äúsmoothed‚Äù/relaxed in the backward country; so that there is an ‚Äúartificial balance‚Äù occurs between the anti- order/system reactions of the masses and the oligarchy. - = The Current Situation = (Written by Mahir √áayan after the declaration of the martial law end of April 1971.) \\" The Campaign/Operation in 1950 was a counterrevolution in Turkey, because the usurers and the merchants with the representatives of finance capital came to power. That was the Anatolian Commercial Bourgeoisie which came to power. The ‚Äúsmall town compradors‚Äù came to power. This parasitical coterie made an alliance with another parasitical coterie like itself and came to power. That was the Dominant Alliance. The Campaign/Operation on May 27, 1960 was a revolution. The Reformist Bourgeoisie brought another Dominant Alliance to power through overthrow of the feudal residues and the hegemony of usurers and merchants. Why do The Monopoly Bourgeoisie and Imperialism embrace the usurers, the merchants, and the feudal squirearchy without to expel the Reformist Bourgeoisie from the Dominant Alliance? Why do they at least tolerate the taking on the guidance role of the usurers, the merchants, and the feudal squirearchy ‚Äúteam‚Äù by the Reformist Bourgeoisie in 1960? and Why do they make an alliance with all these ‚Äúresidues‚Äù through to subordinate the Reformist Bourgeoisie? The situation is too clear. The state in Turkey has never been fallen under the certain hegemony of any coterie of the Bourgeoisie till 1970. The Campaign/Operation in 1919-23 was the campaign of the Reformist Bourgeoisie. The Republic was the state of the Reformist Bourgeoisie, the radicals, the usurers, the merchants, and the wealthy people. The Dominant Alliance made up of all fractions of the Bourgeoisie and the feudal squirearchy. The guidance ‚Äúpower‚Äù was the National Bourgeoisie (resp. the Reformist Bourgeoisie). As years passed, the Reformist Bourgeoisie has lost its influence on the economic life under the circumstances of the Monopoly Capitalism and the foreign-dependent elements were taking over. Imperialism has infiltrated widely and based on/referred to the feudal squirearchy, the usurers, and the merchants. The Monopoly Bourgeoisie was getting power step by step. The Campaign/Operation in 1950 was done. Imperialism has provided full management. The assistance of the Monopoly Bourgeoisie was not the essential ‚Äúpower‚Äù at that moment. The ‚Äúpower‚Äù was the ‚Äúteam‚Äù of the usurers, the merchants, and the feudal squirearchy. The situation of the Monopoly Bourgeoisie was not enough to be a mainstay. The years went by, and it was essential for the interests of Imperialism and Capitalism to ‚Äúrefine‚Äù this ally. The Imperialist Relations of Production was consolidating the Monopoly Bourgeoisie. At last, the Campaign/Operation in 1960 was done. Because of the situation of the Monopoly Bourgeoisie, which was not enough to be a main ‚Äúpower‚Äù, USA supported the Reformist Bourgeoisie during the revolution. All economic, administrative and social measures of the Reformist Bourgeoisie was going to strengthen the Monopoly Bourgeoisie in the world of 60's anyway. And it was so. Then shortly after, The Reformist Bourgeoisie replaced with the Monopoly Bourgeoisie in 1963. Because of its inability, the Monopoly Bourgeoisie enfranchised and did not refine the Reformist Bourgeoisie. Moreover, the Monopoly Bourgeoisie privileged (but not like before) the team of the usurers and the merchants; so that a strange ‚Äúadministrative balance‚Äù was established in the country. We are able to call this phase as the ‚ÄúComparative Balance Phase‚Äù (Turkish: Nispi Denge D√∂nemi). This ‚ÄúComparative Balance‚Äù is bilateral: 1- Between the Dominant Alliances and the Reformist Bourgeoisie (The Reflection is the Constitution of 1961 and the decisive way/‚Äùpower‚Äù is the Dominant Alliance). 2- Intra-Alliance, between the Monopoly Bourgeoisie and the usurers and the merchants, the decisive way/‚Äùpower‚Äù is the Monopoly Bourgeoisie. So that, Turkish Republic has been an exception among the semi-colonial countries, because no other country has had the same limited democratic rights. Like France, like a ‚Äúlower level‚Äù copy of France. The fifth phase is the Campaign/Operation on March 12, 1971 . That is the end of the Comparative Balance Phase. The Monopoly Bourgeoisie had had full control over the Dominant Alliance. .. \\"  √áayan's Critique of Trotskyist Permanent Revolution Theory  \\"The revolutionary perspective of Marx and Engels in the phase from 1848 until Autumn 1850 is the permanent revolution. This strategical vision is the result of the misjudgment of the related phase. Based on the great crises ( the global commercial and industrial crises and the agricultural crisis) in 1847, Marx and Engels assumed that ‚Äúthe final hours‚Äù of capitalism has come, and the great fight and the age of the socialist revolutions have begun finally. So that means, Marx and Engels thought that the ‚Äúboomed‚Äù global economical crisis of Capitalism in 1847 is the permanent and the last crisis of the system. This theory of Permanent Revolution is the product of the theory of Permanent Crisis. In the phase of 1847-50, Marx and Engels thought that the proletarian revolution in France and in Europe gonna be in immediate future, therefore they were standing for the leadership of proletariat to do the overdue bourgeois revolution in Germany. In this period, Marx and Engels focused most of their practical and theoretical works on Germany: ‚ÄúThe Communists turn their attention chiefly to Germany, because that country is on the eve of a bourgeois revolution that is bound to be carried out under more advanced conditions of European civilisation and with a much more developed proletariat than that of England was in the seventeenth, and France in the eighteenth century, and because the bourgeois revolution in Germany will be but the prelude to an immediately following proletarian revolution‚Äù. (Manifesto of the Communist Party by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels February 1848) Obviously, the Permanent Revolution was the revolution considered for Germany by Marx and Engels. And this Permanent Revolution was not a ‚Äústageless‚Äù but a ‚ÄúStagewise‚Äù Revolution Theory. Now, this is extremely significant. This is the fundamental property of this theory, which was applied to life in the imperialist epoch by Lenin, that distinguishes itself from the theory of Trotskyist Permanent Revolution. Not only Marx and Engels but also Gottschalk and his supporters have considered the Permanent Revolution for Germany in 1849. But the Permanent Revolution of Gottschalk and his supporters is a ‚ÄúStageless‚Äù or a ‚ÄúOne-Stage‚Äù Revolution. (Underestimating of the revolutionary potential of the peasants and refusal to make an alliance with proletariat, these are the essences of this theory). The essence of Trotsky's Permanent Revolution Theory, that he tried to base on Marx, belongs to the vulgar communists Gottschalk and Weitling. That means, the Trotskyist Permanent Revolution Theory is NOT a Marxist Theory.\\" In culture =Music= * Grup Yorum - Kƒ±zƒ±ldere * Grup Yorum - Sen Olacaƒüƒ±z * Grup Kƒ±zƒ±lƒ±rmak - Kƒ±zƒ±ldere * Grup Adalƒ±lar - Mahir'i g√∂rd√ºm * Grup Adalƒ±lar - Ankara'dan Bir Haber Var * Emek√ßi - Kƒ±zƒ±ldere =Films= * Hatƒ±rla Sevgili =Books= * Ali H.

Other salient points in this plan included the recognition that in addition to undercapitalisation in some areas, the industry also suffered in places from being sub-scale and thus inefficient, posing a threat to the industry's international competitiveness, particularly as competition may increase following the relaxation of trade and commerce restrictions among members of ASEAN, commencing in 2015. The Plan recommended in addition to consolidation that the industry seek the more active involvement of multinational insurance groups able to provide the necessary capital as well as expertise to ensure the Thai insurance industry remains internationally benchmarked.Office of the Insurance Commission Insurance Development Plan volume II 2010-2014 References External links * Office of Insurance Commission Category:Independent administrative organizations of Thailand Category:Economy of Thailand Category:Insurance regulation Category:Regulation in Thailand ","title":"Office of Insurance Commission"},{"id":"42801387","text":"Play for Change is an international charity (also commonly known as Play for Change Foundation) which focuses on helping children secure a better future through providing funding for primary care, education and access to sports.

It extends the length of Hancock's Main Street, from Pine Ridge Cemetery and the common to the west, and the junction of Bennington, Norway Hill, and Forest roads to the east. It then extends a short way up Bennington Road. The common was laid out in 1785, and the village developed nearby over the next 100+ years. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history Hancock Village is located near the geographic center of the rural hill town. The town was settled in the 1770s and was incorporated in 1780, but without provision for any public spaces. Because the exact geographic center of the town was located in a large marshy area, the residents were unable to agree on an alternative, and a state commission was appointed to choose the site of the common in 1785. The common and its immediate surrounding were dedicated to civic buildings and sites, including the town's first cemetery and animal pound, as well as the meeting house and an early school. An armory built on the common in the late 19th century was converted into a Grange hall. The common also has structures related to its conversion in the early 20th century to a public park, including a bandstand, fountain, and war memorial. The Main Street area east of the common developed in the 19th century as a commercial and residential area for the town, with much of its development taking place in the first half of the 19th century. Almost all of the houses are vernacular Greek Revival or Federal in their styling. There are commercial buildings lining a portion of Main Street which are also predominantly vernacular mid-to-late 19th century in their construction.

It has a central four-story main block, finished mainly in red brick. There are eight store fronts, articulated by brick piers rising the full height of the building. The central entrance, originally for the opera house, projects slightly, and there are secondary entrances between the first and second bays at each end. The storefronts are topped by pressed metal panels, and have recessed entrances flanked by display windows.

In parallel, Marie M√∂√∂r began to work in drawing and painting with the encouragement of Barney Wilen who used these images in several opportunities to illustrate album cover on which he played jazz music : in 1991, Sanctuary, in 1992, Dream Time and also Essential Ballads. In 1987, Marie M√∂√∂r signed a record contract with Polydor Records. The French newspaper Lib√©ration published this info with a photo in a front-page news. A strong media exposure which frighten the record company and preferring no longer support the artist. However, a single has been released on the major label : Prends-moi, Prends-moi, in a calypso-style music. The song has been signed by Michel Moers of the music band Telex and Barney Wilen. = 1990s = In 1993, Marie M√∂√∂r released the debut album Aigre-Douce with Alfa records. She covers song of Damia and several French standards. The album also features her personal songs : Angelo and a new version of Beau Masque. The album was released in Japan and distributed in France. She also sang two songs, Tu ne sais pas aimer (Damia) and J'ai le cafard (Fr√©hel) on the Barney Wilen's album Starbust forever. In 1998, the French singer-songwriter Jean-Louis Murat composed an album entitled Svoboda and based on texts by Marie M√∂√∂r. Unfortunately, an unpublished musical recording despite the continual support of Bruno Bayon : \\"Svoboda with Je vais mourir sauf accident worthy of Jacques Dutronc or Se voir se rendre worthy of Fran√ßoise Hardy, album which has remained at the draft stage for contractual and economic reasons.\\" = 2000s = In 2001, Christophe, one of the masters of French pop and best known for his 1965 hit single Aline, took two texts of Marie M√∂√∂r : La Man and J‚Äôaime l‚Äôennui for his album Comme si la terre penchait. A new artistic collaboration with Christophe in 2008 for the album Aimer ce que nous sommes. Marie M√∂√∂r wrote the French lyrics of Wow wow wow (originally called Parc Rimbaud) interpreted by the French film actress Isabelle Adjani and Odore di femina. In 2012, the French singer Bertrand Burgalat took the texts of Marie M√∂√∂r : Sous les colombes de granit. The song was included on Burgalat's new album, Toutes directions, released in the spring of that year.  Rose et noire and The Other Colors  In 2001, she met the contemporary artist Laurent Chambert with whom she formed the project Rose Et Noire.

It runs from Hamburg-Eidelstedt via Hamburg-Rothenburgsort to Hamburg-Harburg and connects the long-distance railways approaching Hamburg, bypassing the link line and the railway junctions on the approaches to Hamburg-Altona station and Hamburg Hauptbahnhof. The line is mainly used for rail freight.  History  The first part of the freight bypass was opened in 1902 by the L√ºbeck-B√ºchen Railway Company (L√ºbeck-B√ºchener Eisenbahn) as a link connecting Wandsbek station on the L√ºbeck‚ÄìHamburg railway and Rothenburgsort station on the Berlin‚ÄìHamburg railway. On 21 February 1903, the bypass was connected to Hamburg Hauptbahnhof via the main freight yard (Hauptg√ºterbahnhof) at the former Hannoverscher Bahnhof (the original terminal station on the line to Hanover). An extension to Ohlsdorf was completed from the link line before the First World War, along with the connection between Hamburg-Eidelstedt and Hamburg-Lokstedt. During World War II, railway traffic was repeatedly interrupted through the Hamburg city centre by bombing and trains were diverted over the freight bypass. The embankment along the Kellinghusenstra√üe‚ÄìOhlsdorf branch of the U-Bahn had already been built during its construction, but lacked the bridges needed over the Alster and the Tarpenbek. The ability to run directly between Rothenburgsort and the Elbe bridges (which previously required reversing in the main freight yard) was made possible by the building of new tracks to Harburg next to the existing line and a new bridge over the upper harbour and the closure of the former main freight yard. The new line was put in operation on 13 August 1996, so that the Maschen Marshalling Yard is now connected by the freight bypass track to Schleswig-Holstein. In 1997 the Great Belt Fixed Link was opened in Denmark, opening a ferry-free rail connection between Copenhagen and Hamburg, and that meant that all freight trains Denmark‚ÄìGermany used the Hamburg freight rail bypass. In 2009 work began on fitting the line between Gro√ü Borstel and Alsterdorf with noise barriers for the relief of the local residents.  Route  =Northern freight train bypass = Route of the northern freight bypass The northern freight bypass branches off between a former marshalling yard, now an Intercity-Express repair shop (Bahnbetriebswerk Hamburg-Eidelstedt), and Hamburg-Eidelstedt station and runs to the east of the line to Elmshorn. There was formerly a small freight yard in Hamburg-Lokstedt. A siding formerly connected to several major car dealers in Nedderfeld. The line was planned from the beginning as a double-track line, but it was built only as a \\"temporary\\" single track, which is laid alternately on either side or in the middle of the reservation. It continues to the former Barmbek freight yard in the heights near R√ºbenkamp (City Nord) and Alte W√∂hr S-Bahn stations. At R√ºbenkamp station a short branch line branches off to Hamburg-Ohlsdorf, connecting both to the Hamburg S-Bahn and the Hamburg U-Bahn. From Ohlsdorf a line ran on the east side of U-Bahn line U1 via Langenhorn to the former Ochsenzoll (Langenhorner Bahn) freight yard. The freight bypass line continues to the south-southeast from Ohlsdorf as a single track to Hamburg-Horn junction, where it is joined by a connecting curve from Hamburg-Wandsbek station on the line to L√ºbeck. The northern part of the freight bypass ends at the former Hamburg-Rothenburgsort marshalling yard on the line to Berlin. Only a few tracks are used at all these stations and yards. Following the upgrade of the Hamburg‚ÄìL√ºbeck line, duplication of the 3.3 km long section between Horn and Rothenburgsort was completed at the end of 2007, including the widening of eight bridges. Between Horn and Eidelstedt the existing track is to be redeveloped, which will allow higher speeds, but requires no planning approval process. Noise emissions on this section are to be improved as part of a federal noise abatement program. = Ohlsdorf siding = In Ohlsdorf there was also a small freight yard, the site of which is used by Hamburger Hochbahn to hold stock. South of it there is a track connection to the Hamburg S-Bahn. Since the Alster Valley Railway had no separate freight track, the freight formerly operated on it ran over the S-Bahn tracks. In addition, the Hamburg-Ohlsdorf S-Bahn depot is connected to the railway network. North of Ohlsdorf U-Bahn and S-Bahn station the freight track ran beside the Langenhorn line (Langenhorner Bahn) of the U-Bahn to the original terminus at Ochsenzoll. Today, the only tracks north of Ohlsdorf station is the U-Bahn line. The long-disused track to Ochsenzoll was completely dismantled by 2008. Part of the route was used for building the Hamburg Airport S-Bahn line. The track between Barmbek freight yard and the main U-Bahn workshop was dismantled in 2005. During World War II, this track was extended to the premises of the important wartime lathe manufacturer Heidenreich & Harbeck.

This link was reported in 1985 in the federal transport infrastructure plans as a line connecting Hamburg-Harburg and Hamburg-Rothenburgsort, but without a specific route. After it was determined that a new route through the environmentally sensitive Vierlande (four lands) and Marschlande (marsh lands) could not be built, the current line was built between 1987 and 1996. The essential elements (from south to north) of this rail line are: *the construction of a new double-track freight line with a grade-separated crossing of the Hamburg‚ÄìHanover line between the northern end of the Maschen marshalling yard and Hamburg-Harburg, *the reconstruction of the Hamburg-Harburg station to allow the at-grade crossing of Hamburg‚ÄìBremen and Hanover‚ÄìHamburg passenger trains, *increasing operating speeds in the following routes: Hamburg‚ÄìHanover to 120 km/h, Hamburg‚ÄìBremen to 100 km/h,  Maschen‚ÄìHamburg Unterelbe to 60 km/h and Maschen‚ÄìHamburg -Wilhelmsburg to 80 km/h *the construction between Hamburg- Harburg and Veddel junction of another double-track line with a new double- track bridge over the S√ºderelbe (southern Elbe) to connect to the marshalling yards of Hamburg-Hohe Schaar and Hamburg S√ºd, *the rearrangement of the tracks between Hamburg-Harburg and the former Hamburg main freight yard (Hamburg Hgbf): old: *two passenger tracks to the east, *two freight tracks to the west, new: * two freight tracks to the east, * two central passenger tracks, * two port freight tracks to the west, *the abandonment of the freight train turning system in Hamburg main freight yard and the rearrangement and simplification of the track layout, *the construction of a double-track link between the north Elbe bridge and Hamburg-Rothenburgsort station with a bridge over the upper harbour canal, *the dismantling of the existing double track line connecting the former main freight yard and Hamburg-Rothenburgsort, *the rebuilding of platform track 8 in Hamburg Hauptbahnhof to connect towards L√ºbeck and the (new) Hamburg-Harburg line, including an extension of the platform between tracks 7 and 8, *the extension of the S√ºderelbe junction interlocking zone, which is now remotely controlled from the modernised signal box in Hamburg-Harburg (and the dismantling of Sf signal box). Veddel Vf, Hob and Wr IV (in the former Hamburg main freight yard) signal boxes are now also controlled from Hamburg-Harburg and Hob and Wr IV signal boxes have been dismantled. After German reunification a new single track was built next to the old line between the former Hamburg main freight yard and Hamburg-Rothenburgsort so that trains running between Hamburg and Berlin could use all platforms in Hamburg Hbf (tracks 5‚Äì8 and 11‚Äì14).  Traffic  It is part of the main freight route between Scandinavia and Germany. When the Fehmarn Fixed Link opens in 2028 the main freight route will be using that link, and the Hamburg freight rail bypass will be used only for a short part. The Fehmarn Fixed Link is delayed multiple years by people who worry about noise along its connecting line, especially leisure home near Timmendorf Beach, without mentioning the noise along the Hamburg freight rail bypass and further northwest. In addition to freight trains, Intercity trains run regularly on the line between the Hamburg-Eidelstedt workshop (Bahnbetriebswerk) and Hamburg Hauptbahnhof, but as empty trains without passengers. Long-distance trains run between Rothenburgsort and Hamburg-Horn on the freight bypass from and to L√ºbeck, if they are using platform tracks 11‚Äì14 in the western part of Hamburg station. In addition, it is used by passenger services during occasional disruptions on other lines.

Previously, he had served as minister for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes welfare in Nitish Kumar's cabinet. He has been a minister in several Bihar state governments, under multiple chief ministers like Chandrashekhar Singh, Bindeshwari Dubey, Satyendra Narayan Sinha, Jagannath Mishra, Lalu Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi. Manjhi has been a member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly since 1980. He was affiliated with several political parties, Indian National Congress (1980‚Äì1990), Janata Dal (1990‚Äì1996), Rashtriya Janata Dal (1996‚Äì2005) and JD(U) (2005‚Äì2015). He was expelled from JD(U) following the February 2015 political crisis and subsequently Jitan Ram Manjhi emerged as a major Dalit face in Bihar. In May 2015, he announced the new political party, Hindustani Awam Morcha. In July 2015, Jitan Ram Manjhi was accorded \\"Z\\"-plus security cover by the Union Home Ministry.http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jitan-ram-manjhi-gets-zplus- security/article7444740.ece Early life Manjhi was born on 6 October 1944 in Mahakar village were under Khijarsarai area in Gaya district of Bihar. His father Ramjit Ram Manjhi and mother Sukri Devi were farm labourers from the Musahar community, known in the West as rat-eaters. He was tutored by a teacher after getting the reluctanct permission of his upper-caste landlord until 7th class. After completing his graduation from Magadh University, he worked at the Gaya telephone exchange for 13 years until his younger brother became a policeman. He is married to Shanti Devi since he was 11 and has two sons and five daughters. Indian National Congress Jitan Ram Manjhi entered politics in 1980. On the ticket of the Indian National Congress party, he contested and won the assembly elections from the Fatehpur segment in Gaya district. He became a minister for the first time in the Chandrashekhar Singh- led government in Bihar. He won from the same constituency in the 1985 election, but lost in 1990. Between 1980 and 1990, he served as a minister of state in successive cabinets headed by Congress chief ministers Bindeshwari Dubey, Satyendra Narayan Sinha and Jagannath Mishra.  Rashtriya Janata Dal  Immediately after losing the 1990 election, Manjhi switched to the Janata Dal. But when the Janata Dal split in 1996 and Laloo Prasad Yadav formed his own Rashtriya Janata Dal, Manjhi moved to the RJD under Yadav and won the Barachatti seat in the 1996 by-election (the previous incumbent Bhagwati Devi had left this seat to become a Member of Parliament from Gaya constituency). In the following election in 2000, he again won the same seat on an RJD ticket. Throughout 1996 to 2005, Manjhi was a minister in the RJD state government in Bihar, first under the chief ministership of Yadav himself, and then under Rabri Devi, Yadav's wife who took the chair of CM after Yadav himself was convicted and jailed for the Fodder Scam.  Janata Dal (United)  When Yadav's RJD lost the October 2005 elections to the Bharatiya Janata Party-Janata Dal (United) NDA coalition, Manjhi switched loyalties to the JDU. He won the election from Barachatti putting behind Samta Deva of his previous party RJD. However, Manjhi was asked to resign immediately on the next day when his involvement in a corruption scam surfaced. Manjhi was involved in a fake B.Ed. degree racket in Bihar as the state education minister in the RJD government during the 1990s. As a junior minister in the Rabri Devi government, he was alleged to have given illegal permissions to institutes to run fake degree courses. He was later re-inducted in the state government cabinet by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in 2008 after having absolved of the charges. During the 2008 food crisis in Bihar, Manjhi promoted eating rats as they caused damage to food grains and as rats and chickens had \\"equal food values, not only in terms of protein, but in all areas of nutrition\\". Rat catching is common with people of the socioeconomically backward Musahar caste, to which Manjhi belongs. In the 2010 Bihar elections, he was elected to state legislative assembly from Makhdumpur in Jehanabad district.http://myneta.info/bih2010/candidate.php?candidate_id=1917 After Kumar split his party Janata Dal (United) from the NDA to oppose coalition leader Bharatiya Janata Party's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, Manjhi contested from Gaya but lost heavily and came a poor third behind winner Hari Manjhi (BJP) and Ramji Manjhi (RJD).  As Chief Minister  Manjhi once considered as a close confidant of Bihar present CM and JDU supremo Nitish Kumar, but is not known for his administrative skills. Following the JDU's poor showing in the 2014 general election, Kumar accepted responsibility for the defeat and resigned. Manjhi, minister for SC and ST welfare in Nitish's cabinet, replaced him as the 23rd Chief Minister of Bihar. Manjhi's promotion, despite his loss in the general elections to the Lok Sabha and a miserable third-place finish in Gaya, has been criticized in the media for being a cynical political ploy of Kumar deliberately choosing a puppet whom he could control as well as to rouse casteist emotions. Opposition leader Sushil Kumar Modi of the Bharatiya Janata Party called Manjhi a \\"dummy chief minister\\", to which Manjhi responded by saying he was \\"not a rubber stamp.\\" But after taking oath on 20 May 2014, Manjhi stated that he would \\"continue to seek guidance from Nitish Kumar.\\" Due to the breakup of the JDU from the BJP- led NDA and the desertion of some JDU MLAs, CM Manjhi's government faced instability and appeared unlikely to pass the trust vote in the state legislative assembly. However, Lalu Prasad Yadav's RJD and Sonia Gandhi's Congress party provided outside support to Manjhi because he belongs to a backward caste. After ten months, the party asked him to resign to make way for Nitish Kumar to return as the Chief Minister. He refused and was expelled from the party for refusing on 9 February 2015, resulting in a political crisis in the state. The governor asked Manjhi to seek a vote of confidence on 20 February 2015, the first day of budget session of assembly. BJP announced it would support Manjhi but Manjhi was short of numbers he needed to prove the majority. On 20 February 2015, Manjhi resigned from the post of chief minister in morning before vote. He told that the legislators who supported him were threatened with death and the speaker of assembly did not allow a secret ballot so he chose to resign. He said that people of the state is watching these politicians and will show them the power of democracy. Controversies During a speech in a meeting of Bihar State Foodgrain Businessmen's Association, Manjhi commented that his government is ready to forgive allegations against small-scale traders that indulge in black marketing and hoarding of food grains.http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bihar-cm-jitan-ram- manjhi-hoarding-black-marketing-small-traders-not-crime/1/380654.html He defended their action by adding that small-scale hoarding by these traders were a means to provide sustenance to their families and education to their children, both of which, in his view, were \\"noble causes.\\" Widely criticised by the Indian media as \\"shocking,\\" the comment came at a time when soaring prices of essential commodities was exacerbating India's food inflation, which the credit rating agency Moody's attributed to \\"structural problems that have widened the gap between demand and supply of food.\\".https://online.wsj.com/articles/moodys-persistent-inflation- constraining-indias-rating-1409217444 References External links * Official website * * Category:Chief Ministers of Bihar Category:Janata Dal (United) politicians Category:State cabinet ministers of Bihar Category:Bihar MLAs 2015‚Äì Category:Bihar MLAs 2010‚Äì2015 Category:Bihar MLAs 2005‚Äì2010 Category:Indian National Congress politicians from Bihar Category:Rashtriya Janata Dal politicians Category:Hindustani Awam Morcha politicians Category:Janata Dal politicians Category:People from Gaya district Category:Living people Category:1944 births Category:Candidates in the 2014 Indian general election Category:Bihari politicians Category:Members of the Bihar Legislative Assembly ","title":"Jitan Ram Manjhi"},{"id":"42801715","text":"Clethra canescens var. clementis is a tree in the family Clethraceae.

He served for some time as President and as General Secretary of the Asiatic Society and in 1992 was President of the Indian History Congress at its meeting in Aligarh.  Early life  Prof. De was the son of a lawyer, born at Madaripur, Faridpur district, Bengal British India (now in Bangladesh) in 1929. From the age of 16 he was educated in Calcutta, ultimately studying at post-graduate level at the University of Calcutta. He taught at Uluberia College and Murlidhar College before joining the faculty at Jadavpur University.  Career  De was appalled that his country had been divided on religious lines. He was a Marxist historian and a humanist, promoting the ideals of a society without communal divisions. He supported closer ties between India and China, and was general-secretary of the West Bengal branch of the Indo-China Friendship Society. A Hindu, he married Nasima Banu, a Muslim and the granddaughter of A. K. Fazlul Huq, after completing his post-graduate studies. The inter-religious nature of the marriage made it difficult for them to obtain accommodation at that time. De served for some time as President and as Secretary of the Asiatic Society and in 1992 was President of the Indian History Congress at its meeting in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh. Awarded a D. Litt. by Javavpur University, De was involved with Calcutta University National Integration Centre, the Dara Sikoh- Ram-mohan Society, and other organisations through which he voiced his desire for communal harmony. He was also involved with the state heritage commission, the road renaming committee and some other bodies. His work led to the discovery in Sodepur of the grave of Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain, a pioneering Indian rationalist thinker and human rights activist. A festschrift in honour of De was published in 2009, titled Reflections in History: Essays in Honour of Professor Amalendu De. He died on 16 May 2014; his wife died a few weeks later, on 3 June. His remains were donated to R. G. Kar Medical College.  Works  De wrote the first book documenting the 1938 visit of an Indian medical team to China. Among his other writings were books about the Anushilan Samiti, the origins of separatism in 19th-century Bengal, and a history of the Khaksar movement titled History of the Khaksar Movement in India, 1931‚Äì1947 (2009). Aside from his books, De contributed to scholarly journals. His 1994 monograph on the subject of the growth of Islamic fundamentalism in India, titled Prasanga Anuprabesh (Essays on Infiltration), was subject to much criticism from supporters of Communism and other left-wing ideologies, as well as from Islamic radicals. He argued that the rise of small pockets of jihadists around the border with Bangladesh might eventually lead to major security problems and he was in particular critical of the rise of unregistered madrassas. He had to settle for publication by a small publisher and was accused by his opponents of facilitating the Hindutva agenda of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal. He continued to speak on the topic.

The line branched off from the Sagene Line at Bentsebrugata and ran along Bergensgata to Lisa Kristoffersens plass in Korsvoll, Oslo. The line opened on 1 May 1924 and was operated by Oslo Sporveier. From 1927 it became part of Line 10, which it remained part of until its closing on 17 January 1949. The reason for closing the line was that it was amongst the least trafficked lines of the tramway and Oslo Sporveier wanted to convert it to a trolleybus line. Route Balloon loop at Lisa Kristoffersen plass The Korsvoll Line branched off from the Sagene Line at Bentsebrugata. It continued along Advokat Dehlis plass and Bergensgata to Lisa Kristoffersens plass. Services on the line continued from Bentsebrugata to Torshov, from where they followed the Gr√ºnerl√∏kka‚ÄìTorshov Line to the city center.Fristad: 138 History Kristiania Sporveisselskab started the construction of the Korsvoll Line in 1923.Fristad: 67 However, by the time the line was opened on 1 May 1924 the company had merged and been municipalized to create Oslo Sporveier. Thus it was the first line opened by Oslo Sporveier.Fristad: 68 On 29 May 1927 Oslo Sporveier rearranged its routing, allocating line 10 to the Korsvoll Line. Korsvoll was connected to the city center at Stortorvet and continued along the Vestbanen Line to Skillebekk. On weekends it was extended to Sk√∏yen. The route was run every fifteen minutes. From 18 February 1940 the western connection was changed and it ran along the Ullev√•l Hageby Line instead. Most of the services were provided with Class H trams with two trailers. Class SS tram in Bentsebrugata Because of fuel shortage during the Second World War, the trolleybus network was expanded in 1943 with line 21 from Skillebekk to Carl Berners plass converted. As part of this work a trolley line was built from Torshov to Bj√∏lsen Depot to allow buses access to the depot.Aspenberg: 69 Oslo Sporveier decided at the end of the war that some of the tram lines with the least traffic should be closed. At the time trams had both a motorman and a conductor while buses only had a driver, and Oslo Sporveier could cut operating costs through this.Fristad: 104 Oslo Sporveier therefore decided to electrify another three lines. One of these was line 23, which ran from Bj√∏lsen and Linnaaes gate downtown.Aspenberg: 70 The tramway services to Korsvoll were terminated from 17 February 1949, the same day the Rodel√∏kka Line was closed.

She is best known for her research on asthma in low income communities. Dr. Luz Claudio balances a research focus on preventive medicine with leadership in community outreach, education, and training of students and postdoctoral fellows for successful careers in research.  Early life  She was born in Puerto Rico where she studied biology at the University of Puerto Rico. Upon finishing her studies, Claudio moved to New York City where she earned a Doctorate of Philosophy in neuropathology from Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. She then obtained a fellowship from the American Association for the Advancement of Science to create neurotoxicity testing protocols at the Environmental Protection Agency. In 1991 Claudio joined Mount Sinai School of Medicine as Director of Community Outreach and Education in the Preventive Medicine department. Awards and recognition Claudio has received numerous honors and awards for her work, including the Robert C. Barnard Award from the Environmental Protection Agency in 1990, an Environmental Science and Engineering Fellowship from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the Outstanding Research in Health and Safety Award from New York Laborer‚Äôs Research Foundation. She was also awarded the National Environmental Education Achievement Award, the Outstanding Woman Scientist Award, and Mentor Award of the Year from the National Environmental Education and Training Foundation, the New York Academy of Sciences, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Work with asthma in New York City Claudio‚Äôs work in mapping and documenting asthma hospitalization rates in New York City has had a significant role in bringing attention to disadvantaged communities that have been most heavily impacted by the disease. The investigation showed that asthma hospitalization rates were 21 times higher in low-income neighborhoods with high concentrations of minorities as compared to more affluent neighborhoods. This information provided communities with evidence to support implementation of preventive strategies focused on the neighborhoods that need them most. Claudio worked as a liaison between community leaders, academics and industry to address the health effects of environmental pollution, bridging the gap between scientific experts and community leaders. Training and education Claudio devotes a significant portion of her time to training students and postdoctoral fellows to succeed in science and medicine. She has mentored over 120 students and post-doctoral fellows. In 2003 she was highlighted in the book, ‚ÄúScience in the Private Interest‚Äù by Sheldon Krimsky as an example of scientists working in the public interest.

He was considered one of the funniest performers in this genre. Early career Callender's Colored Minstrels plantation scene Tom McIntosh was born in Lexington, Kentucky in 1840. He became an exhibition drummer, singer and comedian, singer. He teamed with the female impersonator Willis Ganze. McIntosh performed on some of the main entertainment circuits in America, notably with Charles Callender's Georgia Minstrels. He played with Charles Hicks and Billy Kersands in the Original Georgia Minstrels in the 1870s and 1880s. In 1881 McIntosh took his comic drumming act to England with Haverly's Genuine Colored Minstrels. The proprietor of this troupe was J. H. Haverly, who had combined Callender's Minstrels with his United Mastodon Minstrels. The resulting 100-person show was often called the Black One Hundred. It was formed in Chicago, toured most of the large cities in the US, and in 1881‚Äì82 made a successful tour of Europe. The Callender company was then taken over by Charles Frohman, who built it into a huge company that toured in the US from 1882 to 1884 under names such as Callender's Colossal Consolidated Colored Minstrels. The company again toured Europe with Haverly's Minstrels in 1884. McIntosh became part owner of McIntosh and Sawyer's Colored Callender Minstrels, and one of the leading black showmen in America. His wife, Hattie McIntosh (c. 1860 ‚Äì 1919) first performed with the Colored Callender Minstrels in 1884. 1890s McIntosh was the star of Cleveland's Colored Minstrels in 1890‚Äì91, which made a successful tour of the Pacific coast in 1890 and performed at the Bush Street Theatre in San Francisco. In the early 1890s Tom and Hattie McIntosh put together Mr. and Mrs. McIntosh in the King of Bavaria, a vaudeville act. Sam T. Jack's The Creole Show was an innovative cross between a minstrel show and vaudeville. It opened in Haverhill, Massachusetts, on 4 August 1890, and traveled to Boston, Brooklyn and Manhattan. The show opened in Chicago in 1891 in Jack's Opera House, and toured on Jack's circuit. Tom and Hattie McIntosh joined the show for the 1893‚Äì94 season. Tom and Hattie McIntosh were both in the original Octoroons show, produced by John William Isham in 1895. Sissieretta Jones, the \\"Black Patti\\" The Black Patti Troubabours opened on 7 September 1896 in Boston, Massachusetts. The show included a mix of comedy and other traditional minstrel show material with selections of opera music sung by Madame Sissieretta Jones. It played to mixed white and black audiences. Tom McIntosh was the leading comedian for the first season tour. The McIntoshes then again joined Isham's Octoroons Company on tour. An article in the 3 July 1897 Indianapolis Freeman said of this show \\"... The Blackville Derby, an amused traversty upon the race track, serves to introduce a number of comedians, chief among the fun makers being Tom McIntosh, who is genuinely funny.\\" In 1899 McIntosh was the star of A Hot Old Time in Dixie. The cast included Gussie Davis and Sherman H. Dudley. That year Tom and Hattie McIntosh toured England and Canada with Graham's Southern Speciality Company. Last years McIntosh toured in 1900 with Rusco & Holland's Big Minstrel Festival. He opened in 1902 as head of Johnson's Operatic Cake Walker and Museum Co. in Springfield, Illinois. In 1903 he played with Tom Brown's Troubadours before joining the Smart Set Company. The Smart Set Company, managed by Gus Hill, staged vaudeville-style shows with comedy sketches, songs, dances and specialty acts. McIntosh succeeded Ernest Hogan as leading man of the Smart Set, and would be succeeded by Sherman H. Dudley. The Smart Set Company also starred Billy McClain. McIntosh played Mr. Bullion in the Smart Set's Southern Enchantment. He received a poor review for his performance on 21 September 1903 in Hartford, Connecticut. The show moved south and played in Birmingham, Alabama, around the end of October 1903 to a mainly colored audience. Here his reception was better. A reviewer said, \\"Tom McIntosh, that well-known colored comedian... is easily one of the best comedians on the stage, and regular critics say that he is a regular fun- maker, in other words, does not entirely depend on \\"horse play,\\" etc. He made a good impression here, and the large audience of colored people expressed pleasure with his efforts.\\" A review of the Smart Set performance in March 1904 in the Park Theatre, Indianapolis, was even more positive: Tom McIntosh died of a stroke in 1904 while traveling with the Smart Set Company.

Wasserman was raised in Little Village, Illinois. She entered the world of environmental activism in 1998 after her three-month-old son suffered an asthma attack despite having no family history of asthma. After researching the connection between asthma and air pollution, she turned her attention to the coal-fired plants in her neighborhood and became involved with LVEJO. LVEJO is an organization that advocates for environmental justice in Little Village and throughout Chicago. Wasserman started as a community organizer for LVEJO for seven years and has been an executive director since 2005. In 2002, LVEJO first mobilized politically against the emissions coming from the two plants. They organized the collection of signatures to get a referendum on the 2003 City Hall ballot requiring the two plants to either drastically reduce pollution or shut down. While they weren't able to get the immediate support from their aldermen, after a ten-year battle to sway their opinion, they were ultimately successful. On February 28, 2012, it was announced that the Fisk and Crawford plants would be permanently shut down.

After the breaking up of the band he created the group \\"Pereza\\" with Leiva (Jose Miguel Conejo). Biography Ruben Pozo was born in Barcelona and grew up in the neighbourhood of Alameda de Osuna, Madrid. He started playing the guitar when he was a teenager interpreting the groups he liked, such as \\"Extremoduro, Barricada, Kiko Veneno, Pepe Risi, Santiago Auseron or Sabino M√©ndez\\". He also was influenced by the English Rock With groups like The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Marc Bolan and The New York Dolls. He had not finished high school yet when he formed the band Buenas Noches Rose, being the guitarist and the compositor of the group. A part from their own songs, the group also made their own version of songs from Le√±o and Led Zeppelin. The group recorded three Cds: ‚ÄúBuenas noches Rose (1992), La danza de ara√±a(1997) and La estaci√≥n seca(1999)‚Äù. After the group broke up, he started a new group with Jos√© Miguel Conejo Torres and the drummer Tuli called Pereza. In their first disc, Pereza(2001), Ruben was the main singer, in the next Cds, Leiva is it instead of Rub√©n. In just a few years Pereza started to be really popular and it reached a lot of success. With collaborations from other artists such as Alejo Estivel, Miguel Rios, Andr√©s Calamaro or Ariel Rot, Ruben has also collaborated with Joaqu√≠n Sabina, for who he wrote the song \\"Embustera\\" which was included in the CD \\"Vinagre y rosa y Poncho K\\"(‚Äúel ultimo sol\\") and \\"Ivan Ferreiro\\"(SPNB).

It is Gram-positive, non-motile and coccoid-shaped. Its type strain is AA-692. Individual Deinococcus frigens range in size from 0.9-2.0 Œºm and colonies appear orange or pink in color. Liquid-grown cells viewed using phase-contrast light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy on agar-coated slides show that isolated D. frigens appear to produce buds. Comparison of the genomes of Deiococcus radiodurans and D. frigens have predicted that no flagellar assembly exists in D. frigens. Discovery Dry Valleys, Antarctica Deinococcus frigens was discovered in 2004 by Peter Hirsch, a researcher at the Institute for General Microbiology of the Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, in soil samples gathered from the ice-free McMurdo Dry Valleys of Continental Antarctica. Whether D. frigens can be found in other areas of the Antarctic is currently unknown. The soil sample containing D. frigens was collected from the top 0‚Äì4 cm of soil at pH 6.3. To enrich for certain bacteria, the soil sample was added to PYGV medium and incubated at 9 ¬∞C and pH 8.0. PYGV is a media containing peptone, yeast, and glucose at low concentrations, first used to culture freshwater bacteria that could survive oligotrophic conditions, or low amounts of nutrients. To isolate and cultivate these bacteria, enrichment samples taken at various time intervals were streaked on PYGV plates, where individual colonies could be subcultured onto PYGV slants. Taxonomy Deinococcus frigens is an extremophilic, gram-positive cocci bacterium. The genus Deinococcus is generally known for its resistance to very large doses of radiation, and the species D. frigens is no exception. The species designation ‚Äúfrigens‚Äù refers to the harsh, cold climate of Antarctica where this microbe is found. DNA sequences from six isolates found in the McMurdo Valley were determined by extraction of the genomic DNA, PCR amplification of the 16S rDNA, and analysis of the PCR product sequences. High molecular DNA was obtained and purified by using Marmur's technique of lysing the cells, centrifuging the cell debris off, denaturing proteins, removing RNA with RNase, and precipitating the DNA with isopropanol. The 16S rDNA sequences amplified from PCR were then aligned with the sequences of previously identified bacterial lines of descent.Rainey, F; Nobre, M (1997). \\"Phylogenetic Diversity of the Deinococci as Determined by 16S Ribosomal DNA Sequence Comparison\\" (PDF). International Journal of Systematic Using sequence databases, these six isolates were shown to all be related to the Deinococcus lineage; however, they form three coherent clusters, separate from other Deinococcus species. DNA-DNA similarity data, obtained using the DNA hybridization technique, shows that these three clusters represented three new species of Deinococcus, and were given the names D. frigens, Deinococcus saxicola and Deinococcus marmoris. Using 16s rRNA sequencing as a basis of comparison, D. frigens has been found to have a 97.3% similarity with D. saxicola and a 96.6% similarity to D. marmoris. The closest relative to these three more recently discovered species is Deinococcus radiopugnans, which has a genome with a 96.1% similarity. The full scientific classification of this species is Kingdom Bacteria, Phylum Deinococcus-Thermus, Class Deinococci, Order Deinococcales, Family Deinococcaceae, Genus Deinococcus, Species D. frigens. = Genome = The full genome of D. frigens was sequenced by the DOE Joint Genome institute using the sequencing technology Illumina HiSeq 2000.\\"Genome Assembly Report for Deinococcus frigens\\". NCBI JGI. November 11, 2014. The genome was then annotated using the standard procedures of the DOE- JGI Microbial Genome Annotation Pipeline by quality control pre-processing, structural annotation, and functional annotation. The assembly method was vpAllpaths v.r46652, and the gene calling method used was Prodigal 2.5.\\"JGI GOLD  Analysis Project\\". gold.jgi.doe.gov. Retrieved 2018-05-02. This information was collected and entered into the Joint Genome Institute's database by Dr. Nikos Kyrpides and Dr. Tanja Woyke. The genome of D. frigens is made up of 2,015,889 base pairs of DNA with a GC-content of 65.5%. Of the 4057 genes found in D. frigens, 3987 are protein-coding. The JGI IMG database shows genes which are found within D. frigens and associated with metabolic pathways found in the KEGG database. For carbohydrate metabolism, the genome of D. frigens contains genes necessary for metabolism of fructose to glucose, galactose to glucose, the entirety of the glycolysis pathway, pyruvate metabolism, TCA cycle, gluconeogenesis, the pentose phosphate pathway. Additionally, the genome includes genes necessary for extracellular nitrate and nitrite transport, assimilatory reduction of nitrite to ammonia, assimilatory reduction of nitrate to nitrite, and sulfite reduction. The electron transport chain of D. frigens is made up of five complexes: NADH dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, cytochrome bc1 complex, cytochrome c oxidase, and ATP synthase. Unlike its close relative, Deinococcus radiodurans, D. frigens has no flagellar assembly for movement. Growth Conditions Deinococcus species such as these are well known for being some of the most resilient bacteria discovered on Earth. Deinococcus frigens is in many ways similar to other microbes of the genus Deinococcus, but with several adaptations that allow it to live in the extreme environment of the Antarctic- an area characterized by heavy, incessant winds, droughts, and severely cold winters. D. frigens is aerobic to facultatively anaerobic allowing it to survive in topsoil, and it is able to hydrolyze glucose, acetate, and casein for use as carbon sources. Additionally, this species grows at low temperatures, ranging from 1-21 ¬∞C, which was determined by placing test tubes containing isolates into an aluminum block that produced a range of temperatures from 0-40 ¬∞C. D. frigens can tolerate growth in up to 10% NaCl and can grow in pH ranging from 3.8-8.7. To determine ideal NaCl concentration and pH levels for growth, isolated samples were placed into several PYGV plates where various amounts of NaCl, ranging from 1-20% weight by volume, and 0.05 g*1‚àí1 phosphate buffer were added respectively. D. frigens is also resistant to UV radiation. By placing samples of D. frigens at various distances, 8‚Äì12 cm, from a 254 nm UV lamp, the bacterial growth under UV conditions could then be measured over 4-20 minute time periods. Relevance These extremo-tolerant characteristics make D. frigens a candidate for further study in areas as diverse as cancer, aging, and microbiology in space. Because of their hardy nature and extreme characteristics, Deinococcus species are often used as model organisms for oncological and aging studies. Their ability to combat oxidative stress and the formation of carcinogenic reactive oxygen species may be the vital key in future endeavors for anti aging research and anticancer treatments. The psychrophilic, or thriving in cold temperatures, nature of D. frigens is also of interest to humanity. Psychrophiles‚Äô ability to survive in extremely cold environments may potentially be studied by astrophysicists trying to unlock the key to exploring frozen environments within our solar system. Indeed, the field of \\"astrobiology‚Äù seeks to explore life within the upper atmosphere of Earth. Psychrophiles in the atmosphere have been found living at the very interface between water and ice, and new species, such as Colwellia psychrerythraea have been discovered as a result of this research. Psychrophilic bacteria have also been shown to contain unique lipids and membrane structures which help add stability to the membrane of the cells. In general, microorganisms from the Antarctic are used as model organisms for studying methods and tools of adaptation to extremely cold temperatures.

As a species of the genus Deinococcus, the bacterium is UV-tolerant and able to withstand low temperatures. Isolation Deinococcus marmoris type strain AA-63T (DSM 12784T) was isolated from a marble sample in Antarctica by Peter Hirsch and colleagues in 2004, and the specific strain PAMC 26562 was isolated in the King George Island in Antarctica from a sample of lichen species called Ursnea. The isolates from antarctic marble were isolated in PGYV broth, a mineral salt solution containing peptone, glucose, yeast, and vitamin solution, at neutral pH and incubated at a range of 9 to 18 degrees Celsius. Taxonomy Deinococcus marmoris is a part of the domain Bacteria, phylum Deinococcus-Thermus, class Deinococci, order Deinococcales, family Deinococcaceae, and genus Deinococcus. This bacterium was isolated along with six other related species, among which are its closest relatives, D. frigens and D. saxicola. The bacterium is in close phylogenetic proximity to Deinococcus radiodurans, which has become well understood in terms of its metabolic functions and radiation tolerance. D. marmoris is also related to thermophiles from the genera Thermus and Meiothermus. The phylogenetic relationships were determined using 16S ribosomal RNA analyses. Ecology With respect to the ecology of the genus Deinococcus most of the species are able to live under increased levels of radiation and desiccation. Deinococcus have also shown the ability to precipitate heavy metals and toxins from nuclear waste in order to make removal easier. Most of the species are able to live under increased levels of radiation and desiccation. Deinococcus have also shown the ability to precipitate heavy metals and toxins from nuclear waste in order to make removal easier. It is known that the growth optimum of Deinococcus marmoris is psychrophilic at 15 degrees Celsius, and it is also known that the organism was isolated from a marble slab. Currently, the only known location of Dienococcus marmoris is in Antarctica where it was originally sampled. Genomics The complete genome of Deinococcus marmoris [DSM 12784T] has been sequenced using Illumina Hiseq 2000 and Illumina Hiseq 2500, which are techniques that fragment the DNA of interest and record fluorescence with each individual base of the fragment. This type of sequencing technique gathers small fragments of overlapping DNA sequences called contigs. The contigs gathered from Illumina were then delivered to the DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI), where the whole genome sequence was recorded and published. Nikos Kyrpides added the genome assembly on March 1, 2012 using an assembly method through JGI Gold Analysis Project, though it was modified on August 5, 2014. The Deinococcus marmoris genome was found to contain 4,800,021 base pairs and a G+C content of 64.4 percent. Of the total sequence, 4,145,112 of the base pairs code for DNA. There are 4,688 total genes and 4,620 protein coding genes. In addition, the genome contains 68 RNA genes and 252 scaffolds. The genome includes genes for restriction endonuclease activity as well as a plasmid. Among the 1,046 protein-coding genes associated with KEGG pathways, Deinococcus marmoris contains genes involved in the citric acid cycle such as pyruvate dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, pyruvate kinase, and citrate synthase. The D. marmoris genome also contains genes necessary for the glycolysisand gluconeogenesis pathways, including glucokinase, phosphoglucomutase, phosphofructokinase, and enolase. D. marmoris is able to utilize the pentose phosphate pathway with genes that encode enzymes such as ribokinase, phosphopentomutase, and ribose-5-phosphate isomerase. In its oxidative phosphorylation pathway, the organism uses a multi-subunit NADH-quinone oxidoreductase, genes encoding succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase subunits, genes encoding cytochrome c oxidase subunits, and a V/A-type H+ ATPase enzyme. It has been found that the organism is auxotrophic for synthesis of amino acids such as L-lysine, L-phenylalanine, L-tyrosine, L-tryptophan, L-histidine, L-cysteine, L-leucine, L-isoleucine, L-valine, and L-serine. The organism is able to synthesize (and thus is prototrophic for the synthesis of) the following amino acids: L-alanine, L-glutamate, L-asparagine, L-glycine, and L-glutamine. Physiological Characterization D. marmoris is a Gram-positive, non-motile bacterium that is UV-tolerant and grows in aerobic conditions. The bacterium is coccus, or circle shaped, and its colony color ranges from pink to orange. It grows best in oligotrophic conditions, with high oxygen concentration and few nutrients from plant inhabitants. =Growth media= Researchers have found that D. marmoris grows best with little salt concentration and at low temperatures; it was cultured using a PYGV agar, which is composed of 20 mL of mineral salt solution along with yeast extract, peptone, and distilled water. Due to the organism's psychrophilicity, researchers used a temperature of 15‚Å∞ C for optimal growth conditions, and the optimal pH for growth of D. marmoris is neutral at 7.5. =Metabolism= The metabolism of Deinococcus marmoris has not been researched extensively therefore must be inferred from known relatives in the same genus. The main carbon source for Deinococcus radiodurans is fructose which undergoes several catabolic reactions to eventually the TCA cycle and produces the molecules NADH and FADH for its electron transport chain and the eventual production of ATP. A byproduct of the production of ATP is O‚ÇÇ which can be either endogenously or exogenously induced to create a reactive oxidative species (ROS). The induction of O‚ÇÇ into a ROS is by gamma irradiation which can be reduced with an abundance of Mn(II) inside the cell as the reduced form of Mn(IV). Mn(II) is able to reduce the amount of ROS in Deinococcus radiodurans because it acts as an antioxidant and assists other enzymatic reactions that reduce the total amount of ROS allowing the organism to survive in environments of high exposure to radiation. The metabolism of Deinococcus marmoris at this point in time is limited to the research that has been completed; however, what is currently known is that as part of the Deinococcus taxa the species must be radioactively resistant with similar mechanisms to reduce the amount of ROS inside the cell. Scientific Importance The genus Deinococcus is renowned for being the most radioactive resistant bacteria. They have the ability to absorb ionizing and UV radiation and withstand damage from a range of sources, which can include desiccation and oxidative stress. These characteristics and the ability to resist harsh environments has proved to be useful to researchers. Deinococcus has been applied to the task of cleaning and removing nuclear waste. They have shown the ability to precipitate heavy metals and toxins from nuclear waste in order to make removal easier. According to an experiment from Appukuttan et al. published in 2006, a Deinococcus species was introduced to a 0.8 mM uranyl nitrate solution. After 6 hours, 90% of the uranium was bioprecipitated out of the solution. According to this study, this will provide an efficient and eco- friendly solution to nuclear cleanup and waste removal. Due to continued research and genomic sequencing of Deinococcus, its ability to be used as a model organism instead of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This allows for researchers to have another diverse organism to experiment with. =Genomic Relevance= When measuring the G+C content Junghee Kim and colleagues concluded that it was 64.1% which is high for an organism. This begs the question though as to why if Deinococcus marmoris has a high G+C content that its growth optima is at 15 degrees Celsius? This could be useful for studying the other purposes of the G+C content or what factors could be leading to Deinococcus marmoris not being able to survive higher temperatures as its growth optima as its G+C content would suggest. Other reasons why we should pay particular attention to Deinococcus marmoris is because it has a similar sequence size to Escherichia coli. This can be particularly useful because it opens the opportunity of Deinococcus marmoris to becoming a model organism for environmental conditions that call for low temperatures and high radiation. The sole reason that it could be considered for use as a model organism is based on the fact of its small genome size like that of E. coli, however, more research must be done on its sequence to fully understand the organism before manipulating its genome.

It saw a great deal of action as an infantry regiment in World War I. During World War II it served in the air defence role, first as a searchlight regiment in the United Kingdom, and later as an anti-aircraft artillery regiment in North West Europe. Origins The 2nd City of London Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVC), founded on 16 May 1860, was one of many RVCs raised as a result of an invasion scare the previous year. Based in Little New Street and recruiting in the Fleet Street and Farringdon Road area of the City of London, it was known as the 'Printers‚Äô Battalion', drawing volunteers mainly from the nearby printing works of Eyre & Spottiswoode; later two companies were provided by Harmsworth's Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail.Beckett, p. 70 and Appendix VII.Frederick, pp. 243‚Äì4.6th Londons at Regiments.orgWestlake, p. 161.Godfrey, p. 2. Among the first officers to be commissioned were George A. Spottiswoode and William Spottiswoode. In 1872 the 2nd City of London absorbed the 48th Middlesex RVC, known as 'Havelock's Temperance Volunteers'. This unit had been founded by the cartoonist and Temperance campaigner George Cruikshank and named after Major-General Sir Henry Havelock, a hero of the Indian Mutiny and pioneer of Temperance Clubs in the army.Westlake, p. 179.Falling off the Wagon at Fusiliers Museum Like the Printers', this unit was recruited mainly from London artisans, but had suffered financial difficulties. When Cruikshank was forced to retire due to his great age, he was replaced as commanding officer by Lt-Col Cuthbert Vickers, a wealthy shipowner.Beckett, pp. 61, 95 and Appendix VII.Godfrey, pp1‚Äì3.Cuthbert Vickers probate, London Gazette 3 October 1922. Vickers went on to command the combined unit, whose headquarters was established at Cooks Court, Carey Street (just behind the Royal Courts of Justice on Fleet Street). It adopted the Rifle green uniform with red facings of the 48th Middlesex (similar to the Regular King's Royal Rifle Corps), but replaced the shako and cocks' feathers plume with the Rifle busby.Money Barnes, Appendix III.Maude, Appendix F. From 1 July 1881, as part of the extension of the Cardwell Reforms, the 2nd London RVC was designated the 10th Volunteer Battalion of the King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC), but continued to use its previous title, and apparently added the unofficial subtitle 'City of London Rifles'.Martin, pp. 4‚Äì5. The battalion built a new drill hall at 57a Farringdon Road in 1887‚Äì8. The City of London Livery companies contributed to the building costs, and the battalion raised much of the rest by holding an assault-at-arms display at the Royal Aquarium.Godfrey, p. 3. In 1905 the City of London School Cadet Corps was affiliated to the battalion. Boer War After Black Week in December 1899, 36 NCOs and other ranks were selected from volunteers of the 2nd London RVC to serve with the City Imperial Volunteers in South Africa. A further 25 were selected for No 1 Special Service Company of the KRRC, while others volunteered for the Regulars, for the Imperial Yeomanry, or the South African Police.Godfrey, pp. 6‚Äì9 As a result, the Battalion was awarded its first battle honour: South Africa 1900‚Äì1902. Territorial Force When the Territorial Force (TF) was organised in 1908 as a result of the Haldane Reforms, the 2nd London RVC became the 6th (City of London) Battalion, the London Regiment and formally adopted the title of City of London Rifles. Individual companies continued to be associated with particular employers, for example Gamages (C Coy), The South Metropolitan Gas Co (D Coy), Harmsworth (E Coy), Associated Newspapers (F Coy) and Eyre & Spottiswoode (G Coy).Frederick, pp. 149‚Äì50.Godfrey, pp. 10-11.Martin, pp. 6‚Äì7. The battalion formed part of 2nd London Brigade in the TF's 1st London Division.London Regt at Regimental Warpath London Regt at Long, Long TrailBecke, Pt 2a, pp. 141‚Äì7. World War I =Mobilisation= The battalion had just arrived in camp at Cowgate, Eastbourne, for annual training on Sunday 2 August 1914 when news reached them of the mobilisation of the Continental Powers. The battalion immediately entrained for London and the men returned to their homes, whence they were summoned the following day (3 August) to Farringdon Road in anticipation of the official mobilisation orders, which were issued on 4 August. Within a day or so the battalion was at full strength, having been joined by about 200 recruits from the KRRC Cadets. Like the other London TF units, a sufficiently high proportion of the CLR volunteered for foreign service to make the battalion eligible to be sent overseas.Godfrey, pp. 12‚Äì14 The men who did not so volunteer, or were unfit, were constituted as a second battalion to which the flood of new recruits were directed. This was named the 2/6th Londons, the service battalion becoming the 1/6th Londons. Later a reserve battalion, named 3/6th Londons, was organised to train and supply drafts to the other battalions serving overseas.Godfrey, pp. 32‚Äì3. =1/6th Battalion= In mid-August the battalion went into camp at Bisley, Surrey and a month later moved to Crowborough, Sussex, where it was trained in field operations. By 5 November, a number of individual London TF battalions had already been sent overseas and the 1/6th was transferred to the 4th London Brigade in 2nd London Division to bring it up to full strength in order to proceed to France as a formation. The battalion moved to Watford to join its new brigade, and field training continued until 16 March 1915, when it entrained for Southampton to embark for the Western FrontBecke, Pt 2a, pp. 69‚Äì75.Godfrey, pp. 14‚Äì7.Maude, Appendix C. During the night of 17/18 March the 1/6th Londons sailed to Le Havre aboard the SS La Marguerite.Godfrey, p. 18. The 2nd London Division, soon afterwards numbered 47th (1/2nd London) Division, went into the line near B√©thune to be instructed in trench warfare by the Regular 2nd Division. The 1/6th Londons were teamed with the 1st Bn KRRC and 2nd Bn South Staffordshire Regiment. During April the battalion began to take responsibility for holding its own section of the line, and suffered its first casualties.Godfrey, pp. 21‚Äì3.Maude, pp. 12‚Äì7. The 1/6th Bn was not involved in 47th Division's first attack, at the Battle of Festubert (15‚Äì25 May), but was heavily shelled for several days while holding the line adjacent to the attacks.Godfrey, pp. 28‚Äì31.Maude, pp. 19‚Äì20. Loos The Battle of Loos 1915 British infantry advancing through as gas cloud at Loos 25 September 1915 The first full-scale attack carried out by the CLR was at the Battle of Loos on 25 September 1915. This was a carefully rehearsed attack following four days of bombardment and the release of a gas cloud. The 1/6th Bn's objective was the German trench system running from a mining spoil tip known as the Double Crassier to the Lens‚ÄìB√©thune Road. The battalion reached the German front line with few casualties, but the wire in front of the second line was a more serious obstacle, there was no natural cover, and the battalion suffered many casualties here. However, the objectives were taken by 08.00, after which the battalion consolidated its position and beat off counter-attacks.Godfrey, pp. 42‚Äì4.Maude, pp. 26‚Äì31. Vimy 1/6th Battalion was withdrawn from the Loos sector on 30 September, and after a period of line-holding, it was sent in mid-November for rest and training with new equipment such as Lewis guns and rifle grenades. It returned to the line in mid-December, and carried out regular tours of duty around Hulluch and then from March 1916 on the Vimy Ridge. On 30 April the 1/6th Bn suffered over 80 casualties when the Germans exploded a mine under their line. However, the CLR successfully occupied and fortified the resulting crater, which was named 'Mildren Crater' after their commanding officer.Godfrey, pp. 51‚Äì70.Maude, pp. 36‚Äì51. On the night of 20/21 May, 140 Bde relieved another formation for a further tour of duty on Vimy Ridge, but the following day (while the supporting artillery were being changed over and could not offer support) the front line was heavily bombarded, as was the support line in 'Zouave Valley' in which 1/6th Bn was stationed. The Germans began their attack at 19.45, taking most of the front line, and at 22.00 the 1/6th was ordered to make a counter-attack to restore the position. The battalion made some progress, but its flanks were 'in the air'. At 02.00 on 22 May it attacked again, but once again the flanking units were held up. However, the Germans had achieved their object (to destroy the British mine shafts under the ridge) and withdrew on the flanks, so that the positions recaptured by the 1/6th became the new British front line for months to come.Godfrey, pp. 70‚Äì3.Maude, pp. 53‚Äì6. High Wood The 47th Division's attack at High Wood, 15 September 1916 In late July 1916 the 1/6th marched south to begin training to enter the ongoing Somme offensive. The battalion practised on positions marked out by flags, and adopted identification stripes on their arms: A Company blue, B Co green, C Co red and D Co yellow.Godfrey, pp. 84‚Äì5.Maude, p. 61. On 15 September, 47th Division attacked High Wood to cover the left flank of the tank-led attack of the adjacent divisions on Flers. The first objective for 140 Bde was a line clear of High Wood (the Switch Line), the second was the Starfish Line on the forward slope, after which 1/6th Londons would pass through to take the Flers Line. The leading waves were engaged in heavy fighting and the brigade got to the Starfish Line, after which 1/6th pressed on. The battalion suffered badly from enfilade machine-gun fire from the direction of High Wood (which had still not been cleared), when 'whole waves of men were mown down in line'. Although a few men reached the Flers Line it could not be held, and the remaining two officers and 100 men (including 50 who came up from the transport lines) consolidated a position known as the Cough Drop, a group of German trenches in a valley west of Flers, though their position was unknown to headquarters. The following day a follow-up attack linked up with the 1/6th holding out in the Cough Drop, and at dawn on 18 September the battalion contributed to a mixed force that succeeded in occupying the Flers Line. The 1/6th was relieved in the Cough Drop on the morning of 20 September. The regiment received the battle honour Flers- Courcelette for this action.Godfrey, pp. 87-94.Maude, pp. 63‚Äì6. After eight days' rest the depleted 1/6th returned to the front line on 4 October, opposite a mound known as the Butte de Warlencourt. Next day the battalion seized the old mill west of Eaucourt l'Abbaye. From here the battalion observed the enemy digging a new trench on the Butte, and 140 Bde was ordered to attack it and go on to take the mound. Because of its losses, 1/6th was not involved in the unsuccessful attacks over the next two days, but it suffered badly from retaliatory shellfire. It was relieved on the night of 9/10 October. This action won the regiment the battle honour Le TransloyGodfrey, pp. 96‚Äì8.Maude, 71‚Äì3. Ypres The 47th Division transferred to the Ypres Salient, and the 1/6th Bn absorbed a large draft of reinforcements. Training continued between spells spent holding the line. On 20 February 1917 the 1/6th carried out a large-scale trench raid involving all four rifle companies with attached sappers from 520 Company Royal Engineers and 2nd Australian Tunnelling Company, a total of 20 officers and 640 other ranks. Dummy raids, mines and bombardments on neighbouring sections of the line were used to deceive the enemy. A Stokes mortar barrage on the German front line cut the wire in front of the attack and kept the defenders in their dugouts, while field guns laid a box barrage to seal off the area attacked. The attack went in at 17.00, led by the second-in-command of 1/6th sounding a hunting horn, and met almost no hostile fire. A record number of prisoners were taken, dugouts, emplacements and a mine shaft were destroyed, and considerable intelligence gained. After about an hour, the raiders retired to their own lines as dusk fell.Godfrey, pp. 102‚Äì6.Maude, pp. 89‚Äì92. Messines The 47th Division at Messines, 7 June 1917 The 1/6th took part in the Battle of Messines on 7 June. 140 Brigade attacked south of the Ypres‚ÄìComines Canal with the White Chateau and adjacent outbuildings and trenches as its objective. 1/6th left its trenches at 05.30, two hours after Zero Hour, to pass through and complete the assault on the final objectives. Finding that the White Chateau was still uncaptured, the supporting tanks bogged, and the surroundings being covered by enemy fire, the battalion had to improvise. Company Sergeant-Major C. Bitten of B Company climbed onto the chateau ruins and threw grenades and bricks at the enemy machine-gun teams, who scattered, allowing the battalion to occupy the position. While battalion HQ was set up in the chateau ruins, the battalion advanced behind a barrage to take the outbuildings and German reserve line. Two officers and 30 other ranks were killed in the attack, and 81 all ranks wounded ‚Äì a comparatively low number for the period.Godfrey, pp. 125‚Äì8.Maude, pp. 95‚Äì100. The 1/6th Bn spent the summer of 1917 holding the line in the Ypres Salient, taking part in the usual small actions and trench raids, and during the autumn it was in the Oppy sector.Godfrey, pp. 130‚Äì7. Bourlon Wood On 29 November 1917 the 47th Division took over defence of Bourlon Ridge, captured during the recent Battle of Cambrai. The defences were rudimentary, and the Germans attacked the following day. At first the attacks fell on the neighbouring battalions on both flanks, but the 1/6th's fire on these attacks attracted a frontal attack, which penetrated between the 1/6th and the 1/15th Londons to the right. The position on the ridge was now enfiladed and casualties mounted under repeated attacks, including ground attack aircraft. The position was restored by a counter-attack led by the commanding officer and including all available men at Battalion HQ. The battalion's casualties on this day were heavy, amounting to 13 officers and 369 other ranks, many of whom were captured as their positions were rolled up.Godfrey, pp. 169‚Äì73.Maude, pp. 123‚Äì8. On 2 January 1918, Lt-Col W.F. Mildren, who had been commanding officer of the 1/6th since August 1915, was promoted to command 141 Bde in 47th Division, and he was not replaced.Godfrey, pp. 177, 232. In February 1918 a number of British infantry battalions were disbanded because of a manpower crisis. 1/6th Londons was among those selected for disbandment: eight officers and 198 other ranks were sent to the 2/6th Battalion in the 58th Division (see below). Other drafts were sent to the 1/15th and 1/18th Londons in 47th Division. The remaining men of the 1/6th were sent to join remnants of nine other battalions to form 6th Entrenching Battalion.Godfrey, pp.179‚Äì82.Maude, p 145.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 9‚Äì15.'Entrenching Battalions', The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 95/5494/1. =2/6th Battalion= The 2/6th Battalion formed at Farringdon Road on 21 August 1914 after the 1/6th Bn marched away. The regimental staff were overwhelmed with recruits, 1100 being attested immediately. In October 1914 the London TF Association rented a large country house, Mount Felix at Walton- on-Thames, to accommodate the battalion and provide training facilities. The 2/6th Bn was assigned to the 2/2nd London Brigade (later 174th (2/2nd London) Brigade) in the 2/1st London Division, which was numbered 58th (2/1st London) Division in August 1915. The Brigade concentrated in Sussex in November 1914, first at Burgess Hill, later at Crowborough. In May and June 1915 the whole division concentrated in East Anglia.Godfrey, pp. 32‚Äì4. Initially, 2/6th Bn's role was to provide reinforcements for 1/6th Bn, and it sent large drafts to the senior battalion in February (just before 1/6th went overseas), August and September 1915 (after the Battle of Loos). After that, the practice stopped as the 58th Division was itself prepared for overseas service, and the duty of providing reinforcements fell on the 3/6th Bn.Godfrey, pp 32‚Äì8, 47. In July 1916, 58th Division left its coastal defence role and concentrated at Sutton Veny for final training on Salisbury Plain before embarkation for the Western Front. The battalion disembarked at Le Havre on 25 January 1917 and went into quiet sections of the line near Arras to familiarise it with trench warfare. In March it advanced to follow the German retirement to the Hindenburg Line.Godfrey, pp. 50, 109‚Äì15. Bullecourt The battalion's first offensive operation was on 20 May 1917, when it joined in the Battle of Bullecourt. For six weeks the village had been attacked by British, Australian and New Zealand troops, and it was fully in their hands by 17 May. The 2/6th Londons entered the ruined village the following day and their task was to capture Bovis Trench beyond the village. A and B Companies made the attack behind a barrage, the other two companies protecting the flanks. But the attackers could not recognise the shelled-out trench that was their objective, so they went 200 yards beyond it and then tried to dig in. Having lost direction, a gap had opened between them and C Company on the left flank, into which enemy parties infiltrated. The attackers had already suffered badly from the German defensive barrage, and now the battalion was reduced to small parties, which were forced back by a German counter-attack. This failure cost the newly arrived battalion roughly half its strength in officers and men. It was unable to make a major effort for several months, although it did support an attack on the Hindenburg Line north of Bullecourt by 173 Brigade of 58th Division on 15 June. 58th Division was then withdrawn into a quiet area.Godfrey, pp. 118‚Äì22. Menin Road On 20 September 1917 the 2/6th Bn (codenamed 'UNBOLT') took part in 58th Division's successful attack at St Julien during the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge. Its task was to leap-frog through the 2/8th and 2/5th Bns making the initial attacks, and then turn right to attack the German lines in flank with the support of tanks. All the objectives were quickly taken, together with numerous prisoners, and with relatively few casualties mainly from the German defensive barrage. As the battalion consolidated its gains, messages sent by dog and carrier-pigeon brought down supporting artillery fire on any German troops seen attempting to form up for counter-attacks.Godfrey, pp. 142‚Äì51. On 30 October, as the Canadian Corps captured Passchendaele village, A Company of 2/6th made a diversionary attack in conjunction with 2/8th Londons. Although the company took its objective, 2/8th was stopped by impassable mud. The battalion spent the rest of the year providing labour for the Royal Engineers consolidating the positions won during the Ypres offensive. It finally left the Salient in January 1918.Godfrey, pp. 155‚Äì7. When 1/6th Bn was disbanded in February 1918 (see above), 2/6th Bn absorbed many of its officers and men, and henceforth was simply designated the 6th Bn (the 3/6th having been redesignated 6th Reserve Bn in 1916).Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 9‚Äì15. Villers-Bretonneux During February and March the battalion occupied positions in Coucy Forest where both sides occupied no more than a line of outposts. When the German Spring Offensive opened on 25 March the battalion was south of the River Oise and was not attacked, but most of 58th Division north of the river was driven back. The battalion fell back on 26 March, leaving a fighting patrol in the forest, and set up posts to guard the crossings over the Oise and St Quentin Canal until the bridges could be blown. Separated from the rest of British Fifth Army, 58th Division came under French command. Since the Germans did not cross the river, 6th Battalion reoccupied the Coucy Forest until it was relieved by French troops on 1 April. It was then moved to Villers-Bretonneux, through which 5th Army was retreating. The battalion was resting in the town when the German bombardment fell early on 4 April and moved out later in the day to support Australian troops attempting to hold a gap in the line. Advancing by section rushes, the 6th Londons and 36th Australians turned back the enemy advance, and dug in overnight in front of the town. It was the high-water mark of the German Operation Michael offensive.Godfrey, pp. 192‚Äì202. John Singer Sargent's painting Gassed, now in the IMperial War Museum After being relieved from the line, the battalion was sleeping in the open on the night of 16/17 April when it was subjected to gas shelling. A large number of casualties were caused by Mustard gas, most of them temporarily blinded, who had to be led away in single file to the dressing stations. The reduced battalion was not directly engaged when the reassembled 58th Division helped to beat off the next phase of the German Spring Offensive on 24‚Äì26 April (the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux).Godfrey, pp. 202‚Äì5. After rest and reorganisation, the 6th Bn spent the next few months in reserve or holding the line. During July it introduced the US 132nd Infantry Regiment to these duties.Godfrey, pp. 212‚Äì6. Amiens The 58th Division took part in the Battle of Amiens on 8 August 1918, the 6th Bn having the objective of taking Malard Wood and its adjacent quarry. Rather than attack frontally, the plan was to envelop the wood, but the morning mist made direction-keeping difficult and the wood was taken by a mix of different battalions, including the supports. The following day the battalion was ordered the continue the attack on Chipilly Ridge with three tanks in support. Again there was confusion, but the 6th Londons collected some disorientated US troops and together they took the objective. The battle was a resounding success, but the battalion suffered casualties of 12 officers and 308 other ranks over the two days. Despite the losses, the 6th Bn attacked again on 27 and 28 August at Maricourt, after which it took part in what was becoming a war of movement against German rearguards. When the battalion was taken out of the line, total casualties between 8 August and 11 September amounted to 28 officers and 638 other ranks.Godfrey, pp. 219‚Äì40. When the unit returned to action in October, it was pursuing at about 10 miles a day, skirmishing with rearguards and raiding parties, and suffering occasional gas attacks. On 27 October the battalion reached Rongy, where it began to practise in the moat of the chateau for an assault crossing of the River Escaut. In the event, the German infantry retreated before the crossing on 8 November, and the battalion crossed by a plank bridge with no opposition except steady shellfire that caused few casualties. When the Armistice came into effect on 11 November, the battalion was route marching in pursuit and meeting no opposition.Godfrey, pp. 241‚Äì9. The 6th Londons settled into winter quarters in the Belgian town of P√©ruwelz. In April 1919 it joined the British Army of the Rhine occupying the Rhineland. By August, most of the men had been demobilised, and the cadre returned to England.Godfrey, pp. 250‚Äì6. =3/6th Battalion= The CLR and other badges preserved at Fovant The 3/6th Battalion formed at Farringdon Rd in March 1915 some 1300 strong. Its early training was held in Regent's Park and Victoria Park, moving in August 1915 to Hurst Park Racecourse where the stands, outbuildings and stables were used as billets and the Royal Box became the Sergeants' Mess. As winter approached, the 3/6th moved to billets in Surbiton, training on Esher Commons. Then in January 1916 the battalion moved to Fovant on Salisbury Plain, where there was a large purpose-built training centre.Godfrey, pp. 47‚Äì9. While quartered on Salisbury Plain, the men of the 3/6th cut their regimental badge into the turf of Fovant Down to reveal the white chalk beneath, making it visible from a long distance. The Maltese Cross badge and initials 'CLR' have been preserved, as have a number of badges subsequently cut by other regiments in the camp.6th City of London Regiment Badge at Fovant Badges Society The 3/6th Bn was redesignated 6th Reserve Bn London Regiment on 8 April 1916, and was assigned to the 1st London Reserve Group (later Brigade).TF Training Bdes at Warpath.org It left Fovant at the end of 1916 and moved to nearby Hurdcott Camp, to Newton Abbot, and finally to Blackdown in April 1917, where it remained for the rest of the war training replacements and convalescents for service on the Western Front. The only excursion from Blackdown was a week spent in Newport in July 1918 during a miners' strike in the South Wales coalfield; there were no incidents and the strike was quickly settled.Godfrey, pp 206‚Äì11. Memorial plaque on the 'Zeppelin Building', 59‚Äì61 Farringdon Road, London EC1. =Zeppelin raids= On the night of 8 September 1915, Zeppelin L13 commanded by Kapit√§nleutnant Heinrich Mathy attacked London, and two of his bombs hit Messrs Frank Stadelman's warehouse at 59‚Äì61 Farringdon Road. Falling masonry from the building did considerable damage to the 6th Londons' drill hall behind.Godfrey, p. 206.Morris, p. 54. On 31 March 1916, Sgt J.C. \\"Charlie\\" May of 2/6th Bn won the first Military Medal awarded for bravery in inland Britain, for rescuing members of his section from a burning house during a Zeppelin raid on Stowmarket. Coincidentally, the raider was once again Mathy in L13.Godfrey, p. 50.Morris, p. 70. The 3rd (Reserve) Battalion was disbanded on 18 November 1918. Interwar The CLR was reformed on 7 February 1920 when the TF was reconstituted (renamed Territorial Army (TA) in 1921). The London Regiment no longer existed (since 7 July 1916 the CLR had been affiliated to the KRRC), so its battalions were designated as regiments in their own right, the CLR becoming 6th City of London Regiment (City of London Rifles), once again in 168th (2nd London) Brigade of 56th (1st London) Division.Godfrey, p. 257.Titles and Designations, 1927 However, enlistment of the regiment's traditional artisan recruits was poor, in part because the Government planned to use the TA to maintain civil order during strikes. In the miners' strike of 1921 a Defence Force was formed, and many serving members of the CLR enlisted for three months as the 6th Battalion London Regiment (Defence Force), which camped on Wormwood Scrubs and later Victoria Park. Again, during the General Strike in 1926, the TA was used to form a Civil Constabulary Reserve. Only in the late 1920s did recruiting to the battalion recover from these socially divisive actions.Godfrey, pp. 257‚Äì61. In 1935 the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence, particularly for London, was addressed by converting 47th (2nd London) Division into 1st Anti- Aircraft Division and reorganising a number of London Territorial infantry battalions into searchlight battalions of the Royal Engineers (RE). The CLR was one of these, becoming 31st (City of London Rifles) Anti-Aircraft Battalion RE (TA) on 15 December 1935 and moving to Sutton in Surrey:Godfrey, p. 262.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 108, 112. * HQ at Stonecot Hill, Sutton (from 1938) * 324 AA Company at Stonecot Hill, Sutton * 325 AA Company at Stonecot Hill, Sutton * 326 AA Company at Dorset Road, Merton * 327 AA Company at Hackbridge Park, Hackbridge These locations allowed the battalion to cover the southern side of London against air attack in the event of war. Despite its transfer to the RE, the battalion retained the CLR cap badgeRegimental Badges. and KRRC affiliation.Monthly Army List 1935‚Äì39. The battalion was assigned to 27th (Home Counties) Anti-Aircraft Group (later Brigade). The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, testing the plans that 1st AA Division had developed. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62‚Äì3. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6. As Anti-Aircraft Command grew in size, 27 AA Bde transferred to a new 6th AA Division tasked with defending the Thames Estuary.AA Command at Patriot FilesRoutledge, Table LX, p. 378. In June 1939 a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. World War II =31 Searchlight Regiment= On mobilisation, 31st Searchlight Bn went to its war stations covering London and the Thames. In 1940, the battalion moved with 27 AA Bde to Portsmouth, where they provided the searchlight defences for the Royal Navy Dockyard as part of 5th AA Division during The Blitz.5 AA Div at RA 39‚Äì45 Farndale, Annex D, p. 258.Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396. On 1 August 1940, in common with the other RE AA battalions, the CLR were transferred to the Royal Artillery (RA), becoming 31st (City of London Rifles) Searchlight Regiment RA (TA).Frederick, pp. 858, 864.Litchfield, p. 226.Farndale, Annex M, pp. 338‚Äì9.31 SL Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45 The regiment supplied a cadre of experienced officers and men to 231st S/L Training Rgt at Blandford Camp where it provided the basis for a new 555 S/L Bty formed on 13 February 1941. This battery later joined 81st S/L Rgt.Frederick, p. 862. =123 Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment= In February 1942, the regiment changed role again, becoming 123 (City of London Rifles) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment RA (TA), equipped with 40 mm Bofors light anti-aircraft (LAA) guns and organised into four batteries: 405, 408, 409 and 410. On 3 October 1942, 410 LAA Bty transferred to 143rd LAA Rgt.Frederick, pp. 806, 839. At first the 123rd was an unbrigaded independent regiment,Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, TNA file WO 212/81.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, TNA file WO 212/82. then in early 1943 it joined 65 AA Bde, transferring to 103 AA Bde on 2 May.103 AA Bde War Diary May‚ÄìDecember 1943, TNA file WO 166/11252. East Anglia 103 AA Brigade at Great Yarmouth was the former 39 AA Bde in AA Command and was in the process of converting into a field force component. It came under GHQ Home Forces but retained its existing AA Command responsibilities and took over various vulnerable points (VPs) in East Anglia, mainly RAF airfields. 123rd LAA Regiment was distributed as follows: Bofors gun and crew, summer 1944 * HQ at Lenwade House, near Norwich * 405 Bty at Cromer  A Trp at Cromer  B Trp at RAF Docking  C Trp at Sheringham * 408 Bty at Lowestoft  A & B Trps at Lowestoft  C Trp at Hopton-on-Sea  Detachment at RAF Oulton * 409 Bty at Aylsham  A & C Trps at RAF Coltishall  B Trp at RAF Bircham Newton May saw a number of daylight attacks by Luftwaffe Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter-bombers on Yarmouth and Lowestoft. The defences of these towns were reinforced by moving detachments of 123rd LAA Rgt from guarding RAF stations and equipping them with 20 mm Hispano cannon.Collier Appendix XXXIX. That summer the field force AA units were shuffled as they went for battle training or to other brigades, and additional LAA units arrived to defend the Norfolk coast. On 11 June 123rd LAA Regiment moved to Grimsditch Camp near Salisbury and came under the command of 100 AA Bde. On 2 January 1944, 123rd LAA Rgt temporarily rejoined 103 AA Bde, which was at that time in South West England defending the build-up of troops (mainly US Army) and landing craft for the Invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord). The regiment was based at Bournemouth, but was relieved on 20 March and went to No. 16 H&LAA; Practice Camp at Clacton-on-Sea.103 AA Bde War Diary 1944, TNA file WO 171/1090. It officially joined Second Army that month in preparation for Operation Overlord. It landed in Normandy in June 1944 and served in the air defence role throughout the North West Europe Campaign.Ellis, Vol I, Appendix IV, p 522; Vol II, Appendix IV, p. 370. Normandy Although 100 AA Bde was scheduled to go to Normandy once Overlord was launched, 405 and 409 LAA Btys of 123 LAA Rgt were sent on ahead to bolster 80th AA Bde in its task of providing AA cover for the Juno and Sword Beachheads, the port of Ouistreham and the Orne and Caen Canal bridges held by 6th Airborne Division. B√©nouville and the famous Pegasus Bridge in the airborne bridgehead received heavy German air and ground attacks during the early weeks of the invasion, and 123 LAA Rgt's two batteries lost five guns, six vehicles and 30 casualties.Routledge, p. 313; Table XLIX, p. 319. Nijmegen 100 AA Bde and the rest of 123 LAA Rgt had arrived by the end of August 1944. On 30 August the brigade left the Seine and began a 320-mile march that ended at Nijmegen three weeks later. The journey included brief deployments, without action, at Amiens and Arras and the entry into Antwerp, followed by 12 days' of movement across the Netherlands to the Maas and Waal following the advance of XXX Corps in Operation Market Garden. The brigade's advance parties reached the vital road and rail bridges at Nijmegen on 20 September while the fighting for them was still going on. The brigade's columns following up were twice attacked from the air and on 22 September their approach to Nijmegen was halted by German tanks and infantry covering the roads. 123 LAA Regiment took up emergency positions and engaged these ground targets at close range. The enemy were beaten off but the AA units suffered significant casualties. At Nijmegen, 123 LAA Rgt provided the close protection element of a major AA deployment to defend the bridges. German aircraft swarmed over the bridges, which were also shelled and mortared. On 26 September there were 16 separate raids trying to knock out the bridges by fast low-level bombing, employing the new Me 262 and Me 410 aircraft as well as conventional Bf 109 and Fw 190 single-engined fighter-bombers. Even after the end of the Market Garden operation, attacks on the bridges at Nijmegen and elsewhere continued. Attacks could come from up to 20 Fw 190s at a time, or smaller groups of Ju 188s, and from Frogmen in the river. This carried on until 100 AA Bde was relieved of its fighting garrison commitments on 10 November.Routledge, pp. 314, 324‚Äì5, Table LI, p. 330. In March 1945, 100 AA Brigade supported VIII Corps during Operation Veritable in the Klever Reichswald. Once VIII Corps had secured Venlo, 123 LAA Rgt was deployed there to provide the close protection element of the AA defences, and remained until it was relieved by US forces.Routledge, p. 350. Rhine crossing The regiment's next major task was in Operation Plunder, the assault crossing of the Rhine. The huge concentration of troops and equipment in the 48 hours before D-Day (24 March) required proportionally large AA forces, and 123 LAA Rgt was one of five HAA and eight LAA regiments that were secretly moved up, dug in and concealed, with their vehicles sent back to the rear. 123 LAA Regiment was positioned to protect XII Corps' launching and later bridging sites from the air and from water-borne attack. The Luftwaffe did virtually nothing on D-Day itself, but began raids the following night, when 123 LAA Rgt fired barrages against scattered dive-bombing attacks. With searchlight assistance, three-gun sections of the regiment also spotted and destroyed 31 Naval mines floated downriver against the engineers' bridging operation. Attacks continued on 25/26 September, the third night of the operation, and another 36 mines were destroyed. By 28 March the air attacks on the bridges dwindled as 21st Army Group advanced deeper into Germany beyond the Rhine. The River Weser was crossed on 9‚Äì11 April, and 123 LAA Rgt moved up from the Rhine to take over defence of the bridge sites. There were some brisk actions here against Me 262 and Ar 234 jets, and Ju 88 bombers, as well as low-level attacks by Fw 190s, but the combination of AA defence and Allied fighters defeated every Luftwaffe attempt to disrupt the crossings.Routledge, pp. 354‚Äì62, Table LVI, p. 365. With the signing of the German surrender at L√ºneburg Heath on 4 May 1945, all AA units were ordered to suspend action, and stood down completely on 12 May. 100 AA Brigade was them employed as occupation troops in Hamburg under British Army of the Rhine. 123 LAA Regiment was placed in suspended animation in February‚ÄìMarch 1946.Routledge, p. 363. Postwar When the Territorial Army reformed on 1 January 1947, two regiments were formed at Stonecot Hill in Sutton: 566 Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment (City of London Rifles), with continuity from 123 LAA Regt, and 674 Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment (City of London Rifles) as a new unit. 566 LAA Regiment was in 75 AA Bde and 674 HAA Rgt was in 99 Army Group Royal Artillery (AA) (designated 99 AA Bde from 1948). In 1949, 566 was redesignated a Light Anti-Aircraft/Searchlight regiment. However, the two regiments merged the following year as 566 (City of London Rifles) Regiment, first as an HAA unit, reverting to LAA in 1954.Frederick, pp. 1022, 1030.564‚Äì591 Regiments RA at British Army units from 1945 on.638‚Äì677 Regiments RA at British Army units from 1945 on.67‚Äì106 AA Bdes at British Army 1945 on.AGRAs at British Army 1945 on.Litchfield, Appendix 5. When AA Command was disbanded in 1955, 566 LAA Regt merged with two other Surrey units, 565 LAA Regiment and 598 LAA Regiment into 565th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA, becoming 'P' and 'S' (City of London Rifles) Batteries in the combined regiment. In 1961 a further reorganisation saw 565 Regiment converted to infantry and merged with 5th and 6th Battalions The Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey) to form 3rd Battalion The Queen's Royal Surrey Regiment, when the City of London Rifles lineage ended.4th Bn Queen's at Regiments.org Battle Honours The regiment was awarded the following battle honours (those in bold indicate the honours chosen to appear on the Regimental Colours):Army List South Africa 1900‚Äì1902 Festubert 1915, Loos, Somme 1916, '18, Flers-Courcelette, Le Transloy, Messines 1917, Ypres 1917, Menin Road.

The RA and RE do not receive battle honours, so none were awarded to the regiment for its service during World War II.

In the 1920s the CLR held an annual ceremony in September (about the anniversary of Loos), which began with a church parade at St Andrew's, Holborn (near Farringdon Road), later at St Bride's, Fleet Street (the newspaper industry's church). The regiment would then march through the City of London to the Royal Exchange to place a wreath at the London Troops Memorial, after which it marched back to the drill hall at Farringdon Road to place a second wreath at the regimental war memorial there.Godfrey, pp. 261‚Äì3.

The cross was made by Riflemen Luce and Garnsey and stood throughout the war until replaced by a permanent memorial when the bodies were reburied in Maroc British Cemetery. This cross was previously in St James's Church, Croydon.UKNIWM Ref 17947.Godfrey, p. 45.Maroc British Cemetery at CWGC * Also in the church, hanging from a wooden tripod, is the bell of SS La Marguerite, the vessel that took the 1/6th Londons to France in 1915. The bell was presented to the regiment when the ship was scrapped, and in the interwar years it stood with the regimental silver in the HQ at Farringdon Rd.UKNIWM Ref 17946Godfrey, p. 260. One of these items of silverware, the Mildren Trophy, depicting a soldier of 1914‚Äì18, was presented by the CLR's honorary colonel for the annual competition for companies in the attack. It is in the collection of the Queen's Royal Surrey Regiment.Queens Royal Surreys The 'Zeppelin Building', 59‚Äì61 Farringdon Road, London EC1. 59‚Äì61 Farringdon Road was rebuilt after the 1915 air raid.

He was a founder member of the pioneering 1960s-1970s rock band Necromandus, widely hailed as the second Black Sabbath, and by Melody Maker as \\"Black Sabbath play Yes\\". After Necromandus, Hall collaborated with Ozzy Osbourne's first solo project after leaving Black Sabbath.  Biography  Hall was born in Whitehaven in Cumbria. His first project was with local band, Heaven. But in 1968 he formed Necromandus with fellow musicians from Whitehaven and Egremont. Hall had meant to call the band Nostradamus, but they liked Necromandus, and the name stuck. The band was quickly taken up by Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath, who produced its first album Orexis of Death in 1973, and invited the band to support Black Sabbath on their UK tour. When Vertigo failed to release the album, Necromandus fell onto hard times and split up. Hall, the bassist, and the guitarist began collaborating with Ozzy Osbourne, with whom they had become very friendly while touring with Black Sabbath, on what would become Ozzy's first solo album Blizzard of Ozz. However, the collaboration ended before an album was recorded, and Ozzy Osbourne eventually restarted his solo career with different musicians. Hall is the cousin of U.S. Army officer David N. McKenna. Hall has performed with the Gerry Gillard band since 2004.  John Bonham's Green Sparkle Heartbreaker kit  Hall met Led Zeppelin's John Bonham through Ozzy, and the two drummers became close friends. When Hall fell in love with the Green Sparkle Ludwig kit that Bonham had used for his audition with Led Zeppelin, Bonham gave it to Hall, who played it for five years, before selling it. It was later used by Ash drummer Rick McMurray, and is now owned by Peter Salisbury, drummer of The Verve.

It can be used for various processes during spinning. During the carding stage, several sources of roving are doubled together and drawn, to remove variations in thickness. After spinning, yarn is doubled for many reasons. Yarn may be doubled to produce warp for weaving, to make cotton for lace, crochet and knitting. It is used for embroidery threads and sewing threads, for example: sewing thread is usually 6-cable thread. Two threads of spun 60s cotton are twisted together, and three of these double threads are twisted into a cable, of what is now 5s yarn. This is mercerised, gassed (AKA flamed) and wound onto a bobbin. Processing of cotton =Doubling in the carding process= In a wider sense carding can refer to the four processes of willowing, lapping, carding and drawing. During willowing the fibres are loosened; in lapping the dust is removed to create a flat sheet or lap of fibres. Carding combs the tangled lap into a thick rope or sliver of 1/2 inch in diameter, and removes the shorter fibres creating a stronger yarn. During the carding process the staples are separated and then assembled into a loose strand (sliver or tow). The carders line up the staples to prepare them for spinning. The carding machine consists mainly of one big roller with smaller ones surrounding it. All of the rollers are covered in small teeth, and as the cotton progresses further on the teeth get finer (i.e. closer together). The cotton leaves the carding machine in the form of a sliver; a large rope of fibres.'' In drawing, 4 slivers are combined into one. Repeated drawing decreases the quality of the sliver drastically, disabling finer counts from being spun. Each sliver will have thin and thick spots. By combining, or doubling several slivers together a more consistent size can be reached. The slivers are separated into rovings. These rovings (or slubbings) are then what are used in the spinning process. For machine processing, a roving is about the width of a pencil. The rovings are collected in a drum and proceed to the slubbing frame which adds twist, and winds onto bobbins. Intermediate Frames are used to repeat the slubbing process to produce a finer yarn, and then the roving frames reduces it to a finer thread, gives more twist, makes more regular and even in thickness, and winds onto a smaller tube. Derby Doubler:Masson Mills Over time the processes were refined. At Masson Mill and at Helmshore, there are Derby Doublers. The Masson machine, built by Platts of Oldham in 1902, doubled rovings from the breaker cards into card lap. This was then passed through the finisher card to produce the rovings Masson Mill Derby Doubler This process was known as double carding. The Derby Doubler was patented by Evan Leigh of Ashton-under-Lyne (21 December 1810 - 2 February 1876) and, though superseded, still continued in service in condensing coarse counts.One guy from Barlick: Evan Leigh and the Derby Doubler Stanley Graham =The doubling process= Doubling of yarn where two or more stands or ends of yarn are twisted together. There are many purposes where doubled yarn is used. Sometimes thread is doubled to make warp, and it is invariably used for the manufacture of knitting yarn, crochet yarn and sewing yarn. All these yarns must be smooth and free from knots. In a sewing thread, the treads are doubled in two phases. Two or three strands are twisted together then three of these threads are twisted together, to form a six or nine cord. The spun yarn is wound onto a bobbin using a doubling winding machine, and two or more of these bobbins are placed on doubling frame (doubling winding machine). The ends pass through a series of rollers and twisted together onto one bobbin using a spindle and flyer. The process here is similar to that found in one of Arkwrights Water frames, though the size of the ring, spindle and traveller are predictably larger. Alternatively a 'twiner' is used: this is a modified spinning mule and is mainly consigned to the doubling of warp thread High quality doubling depended on keeping the tension correct and feeding the produced thread evenly and tightly on a bobbin or flangeless paper tubes Masson Mills WTM 6 Doubling 5852.JPG Masson Mills WTM 6 Doubling 5851.JPG Masson Mills WTM 6 Doubling 5853.JPG  See also  * Fine Cotton Spinners and Doublers Association, a major UK cotton spinning company References ;Notes ;Bibliography  Category:Textiles Category:Textile industry Category:History of the textile industry Category:Textile engineering Category:Textile techniques ","title":"Doubling (textiles)"},{"id":"42802473","text":"Howdy! is the 1956 debut studio album by Pat Boone.

Design Side view. The T17 Armoured Car was a turreted 6x6 vehicle with a crew of five, being a driver, co-driver, gunner, loader and commander. The T17 was armed with the turret from the M3 Lee tank, armed with a 37 mm M6 tank gun as well a coaxial .30 in M1919 machine gun, whilst a second machine gun was mounted in the bow of the hull. History The T17 Armoured Car was developed by the Ford Motor Company, it was one of two designs submitted to meet a 1941 Ordnance Department requirement for a medium armoured car, the other being the 4x4 Chevrolet T17E1 Armoured Car. In the early 1940s the US Army pursued a number of heavy, medium and light armoured car designs, in an effort to reduce the number of competing programs, in October 1942 Headquarters Army Ground Forces commissioned the Special Armoured Vehicle Board, better known as the Palmer Board after its head Brig. Gen. W. B. Palmer, to impose some standardisation. The Palmer Board recommended the termination of all programs except the Ford T22, which went on to become the M8 Greyhound. Rear view. The British Purchasing Commission continued to show interest in the two medium designs and asked the US Army Desert Warfare Board to conduct trials of the two designs, which were completed in February 1943, the Chevrolet T17E1 design emerging as the clear winner. Despite this, the US Army authorised Ford to complete 250 vehicles as a stopgap until production of the M8 commenced. 32 T17s had been produced in 1942, the remaining 218 were completed in 1943. In US Army service the T17 was sometimes referred to as the M5 Medium Armoured Car, despite never being standardised. All vehicles had their 37 mm main guns removed and were assigned to the United States Army Military Police Corps for patrol duties on the continental United States.

History No. 7312 was built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in August 1908 for the Grand Trunk Railway as number 118. The 118 was renumbered 1708 in September 1919. In January 1923, the Grand Trunk Railway was merged into the Canadian National Railway. Three months after the creation of Canadian National, 1708 was renumbered 7157, a number the locomotive carried until February 1952, when it was renumbered 7240. In 1957, the locomotive received its final CN number of 7312. In July 1958, No. 7312 was retired at Stratford, Ontario, where it had been working as the shop switcher. In June 1959, No. 7312 was discovered by Strasburg Rail Road Vice President Bud Swearer who was visiting the CN yard at Stratford. The Strasburg Rail Road had intended to purchase a steam locomotive to power freight and passenger excursions and No. 7312 was of appropriate size for the operation. The Strasburg Rail Road negotiated the CN for the locomotive, which was ultimately purchased by a consortium of Strasburg Rail Road officials. Arriving at Strasburg in the summer of 1960, the locomotive was renumbered 31 and placed into service that September, becoming the first steam locomotive to reenter service in the United States. The locomotive was purchased outright by the Strasburg Rail Road in 1968. The engine continued to remain in service up until early 2009 when it was time for the locomotive's heavy rebuild. 31 (Now renumbered back to 7312) has been stripped apart since then. Its cab remains on the side of Strasburg's engine shed. Due to the railroad's busy contract work and upkeep of their fleet of 3 other operable steam locomotives (GW 90, CN 89 and N&W; 475), Steve Weaver, the VP of freight services on the railroad stated in an episode of \\"The Roundhouse Podcast\\" that the railroad indeed wants to get the engine back up and running again once the railroad has the time, therefore the locomotive's restoration had been currently put on hold for the foreseeable future.https://theroundhousepodcast.com/2019/08/20/085-strasburg-rail-road- freight-traffic/ See also *Canadian National 89 *Canadian National class O-9 0-6-0 References 7312 Category:0-6-0 locomotives Category:Baldwin locomotives Category:Individual locomotives of Canada Category:Preserved steam locomotives of the United States Category:Preserved steam locomotives of Canada Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Canada Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1908 Category:Standard gauge locomotives of the United States ","title":"Canadian National 7312"},{"id":"42802532","title":"Table Tennis England"},{"id":"42802553","title":"Next!"},{"id":"42802564","text":"The ruins of Old Tanauan (Ruinas de Tanauan) located at the lake shore of Talisay in Batangas Province are remains of a church structure dating to the Spanish Colonial Period of the Philippines. It is the site of the first stone church of Tanauan, before the whole town relocated to its present location in 1754. Currently the ruins are within the property of Club Balai Isabel Resort.  History  246x246px Tanauan was among the earliest lake shore towns established by the Augustinian missionaries (together with Taal, Lipa, Bauan and Sala) in Batangas around the late 16th century. Founded in 1584, the town was established at the northern shore of the Taal Lake (originally called Bonbon) near the foot of Tagaytay Ridge, which was described by a Spanish priest Fray Juan de Medina OSA as a \\"truly frightful hill for more than one legua\\" as one descends from Manila. Together with its founding was the building of the church and convent out of wooden materials. The wooden church was then replaced by a stone structure around 1732 as indicated in a Spanish historical document, which states the exemption of Tanauan from paying annual contributions to the monastery of San Agustin in Manila as the money was being used for the construction of their church. However, the stone church was short lived due to the violent eruption of the Taal Volcano in 1754, which devastated the towns around the lake; including Tanauan. Volcanic debris created blockage at the mouth of the Pansipit River south of Lake Taal, causing the water level of the lake to rise and submerge the northern and eastern lake shore towns. The rising flood waters, together with the series of earthquakes that were felt prior to the eruption, led the inhabitants of Tanauan to relocate to its present location, abandoning their old town.  Structural features  The visible part of the church ruins are mostly the walls wherein two types of materials were used in its construction. Most of the remaining walls were composed of massive concrete masonry blocks made of lime, sand and mostly shells of sunset clams, a marine bivalve. Clay tiles were used in filling the gaps or lining between these wall blocks. Other parts of the ruins still have the remains of an upper wall level constructed in different set of materials composed of lime, sand, volcanic rocks and fragments of earthenware and stoneware ceramics. These materials were also found in interior wall features attached to the massive masonry blocks. Remains of stucco or paletada were still seen on the interior wall surface of the structure, which served as the plaster coating of the walls. Small buttress-like structures can also be found connected outside the walls of the ruins, which were made of smaller carved adobe blocks. Mortar (lime and sand) was used to cement these blocks together.  Archaeological investigation of the ruins  Burials exposed from the archaeological excavations within the Old Tanauan ruins In 2010, human remains were accidentally unearthed during the landscaping activities of the Club Balai Isabel Resort, which was brought to the attention of the National Museum of the Philippines. The initial assessment of the archaeologists from the National Museum on the site prompted them to conduct an archaeological investigation. In 2011 systematic excavations were conducted within the ruins around the area where the human bones have been found and beside one of the walls. The excavations revealed evidences of major wall collapses on the upper stratigraphic levels of archaeological trenches, which occurred around 19th to early 20th century. On the lower layers of the trenches, articulated human burials and scatters of fragmented human bones have been recovered, suggesting the reuse of the church ruins as a cemetery, sometime after the 1754 eruption. Adobe structures and the stony foundation of the walls were also exposed during the excavation, revealing more of the masonry of the church ruins.

During the First World War he worked in a branch of the German General Staff, which experimented in biological warfare. He was the German Ambassador to Turkey (1924‚Äì1933) and the Soviet Union (1933‚Äì1934) and head of the German delegation at the World Disarmament Conference (1932‚Äì1933). He sought to pursue close relations between Germany and the Soviet Union. Nadolny left the diplomatic service in opposition to Hitler's policy towards the Soviets. Biography Nadolny was born in Gro√ü St√ºrlack, East Prussia (modern Ster≈Çawki Wielkie, Poland) to Heinrich (1847‚Äì1944) and Agnes Nadolny n√©e Trinker (1847‚Äì1910). His father's family had been landowners in East Prussia since the 14th century. His mother's ancestors were Protestant exiles from Salzburg. Nadolny passed his Abitur at the gymnasium (school) of Rastenburg in 1892 and studied law at the University of K√∂nigsberg. Nadolny joined the German diplomatic service in 1902 and was deployed in St. Petersburg in 1903 -1907 where he witnessed the Russian Revolution of 1905 and the Russo-Japanese War. Nadolny was then sent to Persia, Bosnia and Albania. = First World War = During the First World War Nadolny led the political section of the German General Staff the so-called \\"\\"Sektion Politik Berlin des Generalstabs\\".

As such, Nadolny took part in the negotiations which led to the Treaty of Brest- Litovsk. = Interwar era = After the end of the First World War, Nadolny was the Foreign Office's representative in the Office of the German President. From January 1920 he led the German legation in Stockholm and became German ambassador to Turkey in May 1924. During the interwar era Nadolny wrote that out of mixing of German and \\"Slavic\\" blood a new species and race would be born, an \\"East-Elbian\\" race,Rudolf Nadolny Stollberg, Germanisierung oder Slavisierung?: Eine Entgegnung auf Masaryks Buch Das neue Europa, 1928 - and attacked the Czech national leader Masaryk for criticizing \\"Prussian Spirit\\", claiming that Czechs are just relatives of Prussians.Erik von Kuehnelt- Leddihn, The Menace of the Herd, or, Procrustes at Large, page 232, 1943, reprinted 2007 Ludwik Mieses Institute In November 1928, after the death of Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau, the German ambassador in Moscow, Nadolny applied for this post but his efforts were vetoed by Gustav Stresemann, who appointed Herbert von Dirksen instead. From February 1932 to October 1933, Nadolny was the head of the German delegation at the World Disarmament Conference in Geneva. In the spring of 1932, when General Kurt von Schleicher brought down the government of Heinrich Br√ºning and had his friend Franz von Papen appointed Chancellor, Nadolny was of the three men interviewed by Scheicher as a possible foreign minister for the Papen government.Watt, D.C. \\"Diplomacy and Diplomatists\\" pages 330-341 from The Origins of World War Two edited by Robert Boyce and Joseph Maiolo, London: Macmillan, 2003 page 336. The other two men interviewed to be Foreign Minister were Baron Leopold von Hoesch, the German ambassador to France, and Baron Konstantin von Neurath, the German ambassador to Great Britain. Ultimately, Neurath was chosen by Schleicher to be the foreign minister in the \\"Cabinet of the President's Friends\\" as the Papen government was known, and he never forgot that Nadolny was disappointed that he did not get the portfolio, which he wanted very badly. Neurath stayed on as Foreign Minister, serving in the Papen, Schleicher and Hitler governments, lasting until 4 February 1938 when Hitler fired him. Nadolny became the German ambassador to the Soviet Union in October 1933. Neurath-who saw Nadolny as a rival-and knowing of Hitler's anti-Soviet inclinations and Nadolny's advocacy of better relations with the Soviet Union, gave him the Moscow appointment in order to ruin his career. Nadolny's attempts to enhance German‚ÄìSoviet relations on the basis of the Treaty of Rapallo (1922) were largely unsuccessful as this contradicted Hitler's policy. Nadolny believed in 1933 that it was feasible for Nazi Germany to annex Polish territories in Pomerania in exchange for promising the Poles Lithuanian MemelCollective security of isolation?: Soviet foreign policy and Poland, 1930-1935 Evropeiskiy Dom, page 34-35 \\"Rudolf Nadolny believed that \\"the assignment to Poland of a bank of Lithuanian territory leading up to Memel\\" was a \\"feasible solution\\" Nadolny argued against the German‚ÄìPolish Non- Aggression Pact of 1934 because of its influence on German‚ÄìSoviet relations and urged \\"decent treatment\\" of Litvinov \\"even if he is Jewish\\".Russia and Italy against Hitler: the Bolshevik-Fascist rapprochment of the 1930s Joseph Calvitt Clarke, Greenwood Press, 1991, page 46 In a conference with Hitler, Nadolny pointed out that in his view close ties with Russia were of essential interest, while Hitler rejected any compromise with Bolshevism. However, Nadolny admitted that a really friendly relationship with Russia was impossible.Russia and Germany by Walter Ze'ev Laqueur, page 177 The meeting, which was described as a \\"stormy one\\", ended with Hitler declaring the conversation finished while Nadolny answered that \\"the conversation had just begun\\". On another occasion he addressed Hitler as \\"Herr Reichskanzler\\", as opposed to the common \\"Mein F√ºhrer\\", and refused to use the Nazi salute. Nadolny resigned on 16 June 1934 and worked as an administrator of an estate. In World War II he served as a captain and later major at the Wehrmacht's High Command and on the staff of Admiral Canaris. = Postwar = In 1945 Nadolny, without a compromising Nazi party affiliation, became president of the German Red Cross and was active in the \\"Society for German reunification\\" and the \\"German Unity Association\\". With the growing tensions between the Western Allies and the Soviets, Nadolny was sometimes seen as a Soviet agent and generally mistrusted. During the Blockade of Berlin in 1948‚Äì49, Nadolny moved to West Germany. He died in 1953 in D√ºsseldorf. =Family= Nadolny married √Ñnny Matthiessen (1882‚Äì1977) in 1905.

There, he founded a storefront church, and worked in a wide variety of jobs including cook and probation officer, as well as becoming an established figure in Congressman William Dawson's political machine. As Rev. Arthur Leaner, he made his first broadcasts, of sermons and gospel music, on radio station WGES in 1943. William Barlow, Voice Over: The Making of Black Radio, Temple University Press, 1999, pp. 98-102 In 1945, using the pseudonym Al Benson, he started broadcasting a regular weekly one- hour secular show on WGES, in a different slot in which - unlike in the religious program - he was allowed to advertise products. He referred to himself on air as \\"the Old Swingmaster\\". Within two years, his output had increased to twenty hours a week, on WGES and WJJD, and in 1948 he was voted the most popular DJ in Chicago. The following year, he was elected to the honorary post of \\"Mayor of Bronzeville\\", which he won for several consecutive years, a testament to his huge popularity among African-Americans in the city. This is attributed to the fact that he spoke in colloquial terms with a strong Southern accent, like many of those who had migrated to the city, and that he played many of the blues and rhythm and blues records that had previously been ignored by broadcasters because of their \\"suggestive\\" lyrics and \\"lowlife\\" connotations. Although there had been earlier black personalities on radio in Chicago, notably Jack L. Cooper, Benson later said: Charles Walton, \\"Al Benson‚Äîthe Godfather of Black Radio in Chicago\\", JazzinChicago.org.

His power to influence the record-buying public gave him great influence over the local recording industry. It was said that he \\"revolutionized Chicago's Black radio programming,\\" and that \\"..he was the main reason why so many independent black record companies featuring rhythm and blues and even gospel artists grew.\\" \\"Black Waves - A Tribute to DJ Al Benson\\". Oocities.org, Retrieved 18 May 2014 In the early 1950s he also helped set up record labels, including Parrot, Blue Lake, and Old Swing- Master, to cater for the growing demand for blues and R&B; music. The labels recorded such musicians as T-Bone Walker, J.B. Lenoir, Sunnyland Slim, Albert King, Willie Mabon, Coleman Hawkins, Lorez Alexandria, and, later in the 1960s, Magic Sam and others. At the height of his popularity in the 1950s he had regular television shows, and sponsored many rock and roll and R&B; concerts in Chicago. He encouraged younger black DJs to follow in his path. He also became the owner of a newspaper, record shop, restaurant, and boutique, which all hired mostly African-American staff. Although changing tastes and Benson's \\"flamboyant and self-willed\\" character eventually undermined his popularity, he remained actively involved in the civil rights movement, ensuring the integration of nightclubs that had refused to serve black customers, and on one occasion in 1956 hiring an airplane to drop 5,000 copies of the United States Bill of Rights over Mississippi. Benson retired from broadcasting at WVON in 1963, and for a time returned to being a pastor while maintaining some of his business interests and moving to live in Three Oaks, Michigan. In later life he encountered problems and became ill with poor blood circulation causing amputation of his legs limiting his ability to work and pay taxes resulting in the IRS taking his home. He later became ill with lung cancer. He died in Berrien Springs, Michigan, in 1978 at the age of 70. At the time of his death, he was survived by his wife, Norma Jean who later succumbed to brain cancer.

Schoon, 939 F.2d 826 (1991), was a case decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The court's decision centered upon the legal defense of necessity as it relates to acts of civil disobedience and federal criminal charges.  Background  On December 4, 1989, Schoon and approximately thirty people entered the Internal Revenue Service's local office in Tucson, Arizona. They began chanting a demand that U.S. tax dollars not be sent to El Salvador, and threw fake blood throughout the lobby. They were ordered by federal police to disperse or face arrest. The protestors refused to leave, and were subsequently arrested. They were charged with failing to comply with an order of a federal police officer and obstructing government function. At trial, Schoon offered evidence of the conditions in El Salvador at the time. He argued that his actions in the IRS building were necessary to prevent further violence in El Salvador. The district court refused to admit this evidence, ruling that while Schoon had clearly humanitarian aims, the necessity defense was not applicable to his case.  Opinion of the Court  = Majority = The majority began by summarizing the factors that make up the necessity defense, all of which must be met for the defense to apply: # The defendant was faced with two bad options and chose the lesser; # He acted to prevent imminent harm; # He reasonably believed that his action could prevent that harm; and # He had no reasonable legal alternative The court then explained that while those factors were not met in this case, and so Schoon's request could be denied on that basis alone, there was a \\"deeper, systemic reason\\" for rejecting Schoon's defense. This was a case of indirect civil disobedience, meaning that the law(s) violated were not the ones against which Schoon was protesting. The sit-ins used to protest racial segregation in the United States are an example of direct civil disobedience, since they involved violating the laws (segregated facilities) that were also the targets of the protest. In Schoon's case, by contrast, he was charged with noncompliance with a federal police officer's instructions and with obstructing the IRS's operations in the Tucson office, while his actions were to protest U.S. funds going to El Salvador. Although the Ninth Circuit had routinely rejected the necessity defense as it applied to protestors, there had been no overall ruling that the defense was per se inapplicable. The court noted that necessity is a utilitarian defense, meaning that it applies where the harm caused by the defendant's actions outweighs the societal cost of inaction. For example, although it is illegal to escape from prison, the United States Supreme Court has ruled that the necessity defense applied to prisoners who escaped from a prison while it was on fire.Baender v. Barnett, . The majority cited several other examples, such as a crew mutinying when their ship was not seaworthy and a court ruling that property could be destroyed to prevent the spread of fire. This means that the defense only applies where the illegal actions actually prevent some greater harm. Moreover, society's condonation of something that the defendant sees as a harm precludes the raising of the necessity defense; it cannot be based on the defendant's subjective belief. Since the U.S. policy towards El Salvador had been established by the country's political leaders, Schoon could not raise the necessity defense without also being able to show that the policy was legally illegitimate, i.e. was unconstitutional or that it had not been properly enacted. Since U.S. policy towards El Salvador had been Congressionally approved, there could be no harm that Schoon's actions sought to address. Necessity only applies where the cost of the defendant's illegal actions was outweighed by its benefit, but that benefit is zero where there is no harm being resolved. For this reason, Schoon could not raise the necessity defense at his trial. = Concurrence = Judge Fernandez issued a brief concurring opinion, in which he agreed with the ruling as it applied to this case. He expressed some doubt, however, as to whether the necessity defense should be grounded solely in utilitarianism. He instead suggested that it should be grounded in \\"a concept of what is right and proper conduct under the circumstances.\\" He acknowledged that \\"[the majority] is also probably right about the outcome of all other cases of this type in the future,\\" but believed that previous Ninth Circuit precedent was not consistent with creating an absolute rule for cases of indirect civil disobedience.

Biography He was given as a hostage to Edward the Confessor in 1051 as assurance of his grandfather Godwin, Earl of Wessex's bad behaviour and support during the confrontation between the earl and the king which led to the exile of Godwin and his other sons. Upon Godwin's return to England at the head of an army in 1052, following extensive preparations in Ireland and Flanders, Norman supporters of King Edward, and especially Archbishop Robert of Jumi√®ges, fled England. It is likely at this point that Hakon (and Wulfnoth, a younger son of Godwin) were spirited away by the fleeing archbishop, and taken to Normandy, where they were handed over to Duke William of Normandy. According to Eadmer's Historia novorum in Anglia, the reason for Harold's excursion to Normandy in 1064 or 1065 was that he wished to free Wulfnoth and Hakon. To this end he took with him a vast amount of wealth, all of which was paid to Count Guy I of Ponthieu. Hakon returned to England with Harold, and nothing more is known of him after this point. However, his uncle Wulfnoth remained in Normandy, took no part in the battle of Hastings, and outlived William the Conqueror.Walker, Ian W. Harold The Last Anglo-Saxon King.

Retrieved: 2014-05-20. reminiscent of the works of Dashiell Hammett, Mickey Spillane, and Raymond Chandler. The novel was written in only two months in order to fulfill a contractual obligation. The book was adapted into a film, directed by Mailer, in 1987.  Plot  Set in Provincetown on Cape Cod in Massachusetts, the protagonist is Tim Madden, a former bartender and drug runner, currently struggling to make a living as a writer. After waking one morning with a hangover 24 days after his wife has left him, Madden discovers that he has a new tattoo, the passenger seat of his car is covered in blood, and he has no memory of the previous night. Following a tip from the Acting Chief of Police, Madden travels to his marijuana patch to check on its status and finds, to his surprise, the head of an attractive blonde woman has been deposited in a burrow in the exact place he stashes his cannabis harvest. With all the evidence for the murder pointing towards him, Madden elects to solve the mystery himself, which brings him into contact with one shady character after another, including corrupt police, criminals, and washed-up boxers. Even a dodgy medium enters the fray as the weary Madden staggers through a succession of dangerous and unforeseen situations.  Themes  = Sexuality = Similar to many of Norman Mailer's writings, Tough Guys Don't Dance contains themes of sexuality throughout. There are explicit homophobic and misogynistic slurs, descriptive details of male and female genitalia, and an overarching exploration of nearly every character's sexual interests and escapades. Tim Madden becomes entangled with his ex-wife, his current wife (whom he met while swinging with another couple which led to his first wife's leaving), a closeted homosexual childhood classmate, his current wife's new lover, a large black man whom Madden simply refers to as 'Mr. Black,' and other characters that are a part of Madden's sexually driven social network. Throughout the story, Mailer's reliance upon sex as a tool is evident, appearing in the form of Madden wanting to 'screw' someone, Jessica Pangborn's \\"large, well-turned promiscuous breasts,\\" the \\"part-queer\\" Bolo Green, and a dependence for the storyline upon a number of nude, obscene photographs of dead women. = Detective Traditions = This book is Norman Mailer's attempt at creating hard-boiled detective fiction. This narrative forms around writer Tim Madden, who, in a hazy fog of remembrance, sets out to piece together what happened to him the night before. On his journey, Madden discovers more death and a serious emphasis coincidences that are too convenient to simply be coincidences. Whom can he trust? Unknown new policemen, a spirit inducing medium, his own father, and many faces from Madden's past enter the fray as he must delicately find a balance between who to trust, who beheaded the woman and left her head in his burrow, and how to avoid appearing guilty. = Masculinity = As seen in this novel, and also present in Mailer's The Time of Her Time, among others, is a major emphasis on masculinity. Mailer's works are notorious for defining masculinity in a myriad of ways. In this book, violence and homosexuality are two major challenges to the protagonist's masculine image, \\"with two gay suicides, oral/anal graphics, and Madden's confession to his macho Irish father. (\\"You think I feel like a man most of the time? I don't.\\").\\" Also, the title of the book appears in the text about halfway through the story, with a flashback from Tim Madden's days a child learning how to box when his dad told him that \\"tough guys don't dance.\\" Madden has spent the rest of his life figuring out how not to dance in order to prove his masculinity, until it is challenged to its very core in the book.  Literary Criticisms  Tough Guys Don't Dance received mixed reviews upon release. Of his positive reviews, coming from The Wall Street Journal and the St. Petersburg Times, Christopher Ricks, writing for the London Review of Books, states that \\"Mailer can still write like an angel, fallen and flaming.\\" He also says, \\"Mailer is a master of small surprises...his style is largely to be trusted.\\" Ricks does, however, acknowledge the deprecation of Mailer's writings by many American reviewers, signaling a universal understanding of the novel's mixed opinions. The New York Times, among others such as the Boston Globe, published a number of negative reviews. Denis Donoghue writes, \\"But what I mostly feel, reading Tough Guys Don't Dance, is the wretched inadequacy of the novel to the intention it clearly enough avows.\\" Additionally, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, in his segment \\"The Books of the Times\\" writes, \\"On top of the faults I've already hinted at - its implausibility and strutting out of too familiar stratagems and obsessions - one could knock it for being rushed, repetitious, all too nearly an unintended parody of itself.\\" Today, Mailer's novel sports a 3.5 out of 5 score on Goodreads and receives a fairly negative review on Kirkus, having called it a \\"thin, disappointing potpourri overall‚Äîseemingly made up as it goes along, with about equal portions of inspiration and self-indulgence.\\" The review continues on to say that the novel is purely Norman Mailer in its themes and language, which tends to divide readers into either supporters or critics with little room left in the middle. Film adaptation Mailer adapted his novel into a movie in 1987, and also acted as the film's director. The resulting film, starring Ryan O'Neal and Isabella Rossellini, was not a critical or commercial success.Tough Guys Don't Dance(1987) Internet Movie Database. Retrieved: 2014-05-20. The movie currently maintains a 38% on Rotten Tomatoes and a 5.0 on IMDb. Vincent Canby of the New York Times wrote, \\"Tough Guys Don't Dance is not the high point of the Mailer career, but it's a small, entertaining part of it.\\" Additionally, Hal Hinson of the Washington Post wrote, \\"'Tough Guys' never finds its footing, though, or a workable, consistent style. The movie has its pleasures; I laughed at a lot of it, but I've rarely found it harder to determine whether the film's effects were the result of the artist's designs or his ineptitude.\\" The movie, however, did have a few supporters in spite of its lackluster showing, yielding less than a fifth of its budget in its box office earnings. Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader, said \\"Norman Mailer's best film, adapted from his worst novel, shows a surprising amount of cinematic savvy and style.\\" References Category:1984 American novels Category:Novels by Norman Mailer Category:American novels adapted into films Category:American crime novels Category:American mystery novels Category:Random House books ","title":"Tough Guys Don't Dance (novel)"},{"id":"42803015","text":"Te√≥filo Manuel Garc√≠a Corpus (born 6 February 1958) is a Mexican politician affiliated with the Institutional Revolutionary Party.

Six years later he was elected hospitaller and vicar of St Bartholomew's the Less in London. He was also for a time president of Sion College. A fellow of the Royal Society and the Society of Antiquaries of London. He died at the vicarage, St. Bartholomew's, London, on 4 September 1861. A tablet to his memory was erected in the church by the governors of St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Works A High Church traditionalist, Wix involved himself in controversy. His first publication was Scriptural Illustrations of the Thirty-nine Articles, with a practical Commentary on each ‚Ä¶ affectionately intended to promote Religious Peace and Unity,. It was followed in 1818 by a more ambitious eirenicon, published originally in the Eclectic Review, entitled Reflections concerning the Expediency of a Council of the Church of England and the Church of Rome being holden, with a view to accommodate Religious Differences. This produced, among other answers, an angry reply from Thomas Burgess. Wix wrote two rejoinders. Reflections also attracted the attention of Jerome, 4th Count de Salis-Soglio, who became Wix's lifelong friend, and had the book translated at his own expense into several foreign languages. Wix was opposed to Catholic Emancipation, and in 1822 issued a pamphlet in support of his views. He wrote many similar pamphlets. He also supported the Society for the Improvement of Prison Discipline led by Basil Montagu; and wrote Reflections Concerning the Expediency and Unchristian Character of Capital Punishments, as Prescribed by the Criminal Laws of England (1832). Family By his wife, Frances Walford of Sible Hedingham, Wix had several children. The eldest son was Edward Wix (1802‚Äì1866), a graduate of Trinity College, Oxford, was sometime archdeacon of Newfoundland, and afterwards vicar of St. Michael's, Swanmore, near Ryde, where he died on 24 November 1866, being succeeded in the parish by his son, Richard Hooker Edward Wix (1832‚Äì1884). He was a frequent contributor to the Gentleman's Magazine, and the author of Six Months of a Newfoundland Missionary's Journal, 1836, and of A Retrospect of the Operations of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in North America, 2nd edit. 1833.

Among these factors are prevailing weather and climate; the properties of the materials used and the standard of workmanship; and the behaviour of occupants of the building. Several studies have indicated that it is the behavioural factors that are the most important among these. Methods have been developed to estimate the extent of variability in these factors and the resulting need to take this variability into account at the design stage. Sources of uncertainty Earlier work includes a paper by Gero and Dudnik (1978) presenting a methodology to solve the problem of designing heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems subjected to uncertain demands. Since then, other authors have shown an interest in the uncertainties that are present in building design. Ramallo-Gonz√°lez (2013)Ramallo-Gonz√°lez, A.P. 2013. Modelling, Simulation and Optimisation of Low-energy Buildings. PhD. University of Exeter. classified uncertainties in energy building assessment tools in three different groups: #Environmental. Uncertainty in weather prediction under changing climate; and uncertain weather data information due to the use of synthetic weather data files: (1) use of synthetic years that do not represent a real year, and (2) use of a synthetic year that has not been generated from recorded data in the exact location of the project but in the closest weather station. #Workmanship and quality of building elements. Differences between the design and the real building: Conductivity of thermal bridges, conductivity of insulation, value of infiltration (air leakage), or U-values of walls and windows. #Behavioural. All other parameters linked to human behaviour, e.g. opening of doors and windows, use of appliances, occupancy patterns or cooking habits.Rafsanjani, H.N.; Ahn, C.R.; Alahmad, M. A Review of Approaches for Sensing, Understanding, and Improving Occupancy-Related Energy-Use Behaviors in Commercial Buildings. Energies 2015, 8, 10996-11029. Weather and climate =Climate change= Buildings have long life spans: for example, in England and Wales, around 40% of the office blocks existing in 2004 were built before 1940 (30% if considered by floor area),ODPM, 2005. Age of Commercial and Industrial Stock: Local Authority Level 2004. London: Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. and 38.9% of English dwellings in 2007 were built before 1944.CLG, 2007. English House Condition Survey 2007, Annual report. Communities and Local Government. This long life span makes buildings likely to operate with climates that might change due to global warming. De Wilde and Coley (2012) showed how important is to design buildings that take into consideration climate change and that are able to perform well in future weathers.de Wilde, P. & Coley, D., 2012. The implications of a changing climate for buildings. Building and Environment, 55, pp.1-7. =Weather data= The use of synthetic weather data files may introduce further uncertainty. Wang et al. (2005) showed the impact that uncertainties in weather data (among others) may cause in energy demand calculations.Wang, W.M., Zmeureanu, R. & Rivard, H., 2005. Applying multi-objective genetic algorithms in green building design optimization. Building and Environment, 40, pp.1512-1525. The deviation in calculated energy use due to variability in the weather data were found to be different in different locations from a range of (-0.5% to 3%) in San Francisco to a range of (-4% to 6%) in Washington D.C. The ranges were calculated using a Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) as the reference. The spatial resolution of weather data files was the concern covered by Eames et al. (2011).Eames, M., Kershaw, T. & Coley, D., 2011. The appropriate spatial resolution of future weather files for building simulation. Journal of Building Performance Simulation, 5, pp.1-12. Eames showed how a low spatial resolution of weather data files can be the cause of disparities of up to 40% in the heating demand. The reason is that this uncertainty is not understood as an aleatory parameter but as an epistemic uncertainty that can be solved with the appropriate improvement of the data resources or with specific weather data acquisition for each project. Building materials and workmanship A large study was carried out by Leeds Metropolitan University at Stamford Brook in England. This project saw 700 dwellings built to high efficiency standards.Wingfield, J., Bell, M., Miles- Shenton, D., South, T. & Lowe, B., 2011. Evaluating the impact of an enhanced energy performance standard on load-bearing masonry domestic construction, Understanding the gap The results of this project show a significant gap between the energy used expected before construction and the actual energy use once the house is occupied. The workmanship is analysed in this work. The authors emphasise the importance of thermal bridges that were not considered for the calculations, and that the thermal bridges that have the largest impact on the final energy use are those originated by the internal partitions that separate dwellings. The dwellings that were monitored in use in this study show a large difference between the real energy use and that estimated using the UK Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP), with one of them giving +176% of the expected value when in use. Hopfe has published several papers concerning uncertainties in building design. A 2007 publicationHopfe, C., Hensen, J., Plokker, W. & Wijsman, A., 2007. Model uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for thermal comfort prediction, Proccedings of the 12th Symposium for Building Physics. Dresden, March looks into uncertainties of types 2 and 3. In this work the uncertainties are defined as normal distributions. The random parameters are sampled to generate 200 tests that are sent to the simulator (VA114), the results from which will be analysed to check the uncertainties with the largest impact on the energy calculations. This work showed that the uncertainty in the value used for infiltration is the factor that is likely to have the largest influence on cooling and heating demands. De Wilde and Tian (2009) agreed with Hopfe on the impact of uncertainties in infiltration upon energy calculations, but also introduced other factors. The work of Schnieders and Hermelink (2006)Schnieders, J. & Hermelink, A., 2006. CEPHEUS results: measurements and occupants‚Äô satisfaction provide evidence for Passive Houses being an option for sustainable building. Energy Policy, 34, pp.151-171. showed a substantial variability in the energy demands of low-energy buildings designed under the same (Passivhaus) specification. Occupant behaviour Blight and Coley (2012)Blight, T.S., Coley D. A., 2012 The impact of occupant behaviour on the energy consumption of low-energy dwellings, 2nd Conference on Building Energy and Environment. Boulder, USA. showed that substantial variability in energy use can be occasioned due to variance in occupant behaviour, including the use of windows and doors. Their paper also demonstrated that their method of modelling occupants‚Äô behaviour accurately reproduces actual behavioural patterns of inhabitants. This modelling method was the one developed by Richardson et al. (2008),Richardson, I., Thomson, M. & Infield, D., 2008. A high-resolution domestic building occupancy model for energy demand simulations. Energy and Buildings, 40, pp.1560-1566. using the Time-Use Survey (TUS) of the United Kingdom as a source for real behaviour of occupants, based on the activity of more than 6000 occupants as recorded in 24-hour diaries with a 10-minute resolution. Richardson's paper shows how the tool is able to generate behavioural patterns that correlate with the real data obtained from the TUS. Multifactorial studies In the work of Pettersen (1994), uncertainties of group 2 (workmanship and quality of elements) and group 3 (behaviour) of the previous grouping were considered.Pettersen, T.D., 1994. Variation of Energy-Consumption in Dwellings Due to Climate, Building and Inhabitants. Energy and Buildings, 21, pp.209-218. This work shows how important occupants‚Äô behaviour is on the calculation of the energy demand of a building. Pettersen showed that the total energy use follows a normal distribution with a standard deviation of around 7.6% when the uncertainties due to occupants are considered, and of around 4.0% when considering those generated by the properties of the building elements. Wang et al. (2005) showed that deviations in energy demand due to local variability in weather data were smaller than the ones due to operational parameters linked with occupants‚Äô behaviour. For those, the ranges were (-29% to 79%) for San Francisco and (-28% to 57%) for Washington D.C. The conclusion of this paper is that occupants will have a larger impact in energy calculations than the variability between synthetically generated weather data files. Another study performed by de Wilde and Wei Tian (2009)de Wilde, P. & Tian, W., 2009. Identification of key factors for uncertainty in the prediction of the thermal performance of an office building under climate change. Building Simulation, 2, pp.157-174. compared the impact of most of the uncertainties affecting building energy calculations, including uncertainties in: weather, U-Value of windows, and other variables related with occupants‚Äô behaviour (equipment and lighting), and taking into account climate change. De Wilde and Tian used a two-dimensional Monte Carlo simulation analysis to generate a database obtained with 7280 runs of a building simulator. A sensitivity analysis was applied to this database to obtain the most significant factors on the variability of the energy demand calculations. Standardised regression coefficients and standardised rank regression coefficients were used to compare the impacts of the uncertainties. Their paper compares many of the uncertainties with a good sized database providing a realistic comparison for the scope of the sampling of the uncertainties.

Matti Ij√§s () (born 25 February 1950 in Helsinki)Kuka kukin on 2007, Otava 2006 is a Finnish television and film director and screenwriter. His works for television and cinema are characterised by eccentric characters, awkward situations, warm deadpan humour and witty dialogue. His recurrent themes include birth and death and other beginnings and ends. Often writing, co-writing, or adapting his own screenplays, he is considered one of the few true auteurs in Finnish cinema alongside Aki Kaurism√§ki.Timonen, Lauri: Matti Ij√§ksen elokuvat. Helsinki: Like, 2013. . Pages 16‚Äì27. Matti Ij√§s grew up in T√∂√∂l√∂, Helsinki. His mother worked as an architect, and his father was a construction manager for the Finnish Defence Forces. Ij√§s studied journalism at the Tampere University but never graduated after getting a job at Yleisradio, the Finnish Broadcasting Company, making children's television programmes at their regional studio in Turku. Embracing Marxist ideas like many Finnish artists and media people in the 1970s, Ij√§s made children's documentaries about such themes as Chilean refugees to Finland and the international peace movement. His first major work was L√§skilinssi, a 1976 miniseries about a boy facing bullying because of his appearance. Many of his short films for children were awarded at the Tampere Film Festival.The Prize-Winners of the National Competition , Tampere Film Festival. Viitattu 18.5.2014. Ij√§s' first exercise in feature-length filmmaking was co-writing the Finnish-Hungarian coproduction Duty Free Marriage (V√°mmentes h√°zass√°g, 1980), directed by J√°nos Zsombolyai, and Mikko Niskanen‚Äôs youth drama Gotta Run! (Ajol√§ht√∂, 1982).Timonen 2013 p. 495‚Äì496. After these, Ij√§s became writer and director for Yle's TV1 channel, making highly individual television comedy dramas such as The Last Gig (Viimeinen keikka, 1984) The Wrestler (Painija, 1985), and Katsastus (1988). His earliest theatrically released films include The Comedian (Koomikko, 1983), Dolly and Her Lover (R√§psy ja Dolly eli Pariisi odottaa, 1990), and Lyrics and Lace (Pilkkuja ja pikkuhousuja, 1992). Returning to the coming-of-age themes of his children's TV years, he made Blindfolded (Sokkotanssi, 1999) and Blue Corner (Haaveiden keh√§, 2002). Alternating between television and film work, Ij√§s has remained a prolific director. In addition to children and young people, his main characters often include middle-aged and elderly people, such as in TV movies White Marble (Pala valkoista marmoria, 1998), Lahja (1997), The Fence (Aita, 2001) and Tuulikaappimaa (2003). In 2000, Matti Ij√§s received the Finnish State Award for Cinema.State Prize for Director Matti Ij√§s, Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture, November 29, 2000.

They were based on similar SS formations called Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz operating in the Warthegau district of German-annexed western part of Poland in 1939. Sonderdienst were founded on 6 May 1940 by Gauleiter Hans Frank who stationed in occupied Krak√≥w. Initially, they were made up of ethnic German Volksdeutsche who lived in Poland before the attack and joined the invading force thereafter. However, after the 1941 Operation Barbarossa they also included Soviet prisoners of war who volunteered for special training, such as the Trawniki men (German: Trawnikim√§nner) deployed at all major killing sites of the \\"Final Solution\\". Many of those men did not know German and required translation by their native commanders. The Abteilung Sonderdienst (Department of Special Services) was subordinate to Oberkommando der Wehrmacht sabotage division under Colonel Erwin von Lahousen (1 September 1939 - July 1943), and Colonel Wessel Freytag von Loringhoven (July 1943 - June 1944). Background Sonderdienst battalion in occupied Krak√≥w, July 1940 Gauleiter Hans Frank and Sonderdienst leaders in Krak√≥w, 1941. The Republic of Poland was a multicultural country before World War II, with almost a third of its population originating from the minority groups: 13.9% Ukrainians; 10% Jews; 3.1% Belarusians; 2.3% Germans and 3.4% Czechs, Lithuanians and Russians. Members of the German minority resided predominantly in the lands of the former German Empire but not only. Many were hostile towards the existence of the Polish state after losing their colonial privileges at the end of World War I. German organizations in Poland such as Deutscher Volksverband and the Jungdeutsche Partei actively engaged in espionage for the Abwehr, sabotage actions, weapons-smuggling and Nazi propaganda campaigns before the invasion. In late 1939 through spring of 1940 the German Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz took active part in the massacres of civilian Poles and Jews.PiƒÖta kolumna (The Fifth Column: Jungdeutsche Partei, Deutsche Vereinigung, Deutscher Volksbund, Deutscher Volksverbarid). Kampania Wrze≈õniowa 1939.pl (2006). In the summer of 1940, the Sonderdienst along with all Selbstschutz executioners were formally assigned to the head of the civil administration for the newly formed Gau. Trained by the native Germans under the leadership of Heinrich Himmler's associate Ludolf Jakob von Alvensleben many of them joined Schutzstaffel or Gestapo in the following year. =Operation Barbarossa= Hiwis from one of two Sonderdienst battalions trained by Karl Streibel at the Trawniki training camp during the shooting action in the pacification of Warsaw. Photo from J√ºrgen Stroop Report, 1943. Some 3,000 men served with the Sonderdienst in the General Government. After the German conquest of eastern Europe, known as Operation Barbarossa, Gruppenf√ºhrer Globocnik eagerly sought another source of manpower. The citizens of these countries who spoke German became highly valued because of their ability to communicate in Ukrainian, Russian, Polish and other languages of the occupied territories. The training of non-Polish auxiliaries was arranged at Trawniki by SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Karl Streibel. Instructed by Globocnik to start recruiting behind the front lines of Operation Barbarossa, Streibel trained 5,082 mostly Ukrainian guards before the end of 1944. They were organized into two new Sonderdienst battalions. According to the postwar testimony of SS-Oberf√ºhrer Arpad Wigand during his war crimes trial in Hamburg, only 25 percent of them spoke German. The Hiwi Wachm√§nner guards known as \\"Trawniki men\\" (Trawnikim√§nner) served at death camps as well as all major killing sites of the \\"Final Solution\\" in the course of Operation Reinhard. They took an active role in the executions of Jews at Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka II, Warsaw (three times), Czƒôstochowa, Lublin, Lvov, Radom, Krak√≥w, Bia≈Çystok (twice), Majdanek as well as Auschwitz, not to mention Trawniki itself during Aktion Erntefest of 1943, and the remaining subcamps of KL Lublin including Poniatowa, Budzyn, Kra≈õnik, Pu≈Çawy, Lipowa, as well as during massacres in ≈Åomazy, Miƒôdzyrzec, ≈Åuk√≥w, Radzy≈Ñ, Parczew, Ko≈Ñskowola, Komar√≥wka and all other locations, augmented by the SS, and the Reserve Police Battalion 101 from Orpo. After the war, the last 1,000 Hiwis forming the SS Battalion Streibel blended with the civilian population in West Germany and disappeared from sight.

She was the daughter of Sultan Ahmed I (r. 1603‚Äì1617) and K√∂sem Sultan, sister of Murad IV (r. 1623‚Äì1640) and Ibrahim (r. 1640‚Äì1648), and the paternal aunt of Mehmed IV (r. 1648‚Äì1687). She is known for her many political marriages. Life The year of her birth has been suggested as 1606.Singh, Nagendra Kr (2000). International encyclopaedia of Islamic dynasties (reproduction of the article by M. Cavid Baysun \\"K√∂sem Walide or K√∂sem Sultan\\" in The Encyclopaedia of Islam vol V). Anmol Publications PVT. pp. 423‚Äì424. . \\"Through her beauty and intelligence, K√∂sem Walide was especially attractive to Ahmed I, and drew ahead of more senior wives in the palace. She bore the sultan four sons ‚Äì Murad, S√ºleyman, Ibrahim and Kasim ‚Äì and three daughters ‚Äì 'Ay≈üe, Fatma and Djawharkhan. These daughters she subsequently used to consolidate her political influence by strategic marriages to different viziers.\\" The Ottoman princesses were normally married away, to influential Ottoman officials, by their mothers or paternal grandmothers, who had the right to arrange their marriages and arranged matches which could be of political use. They had privileges in marriage which separated them from other Muslim females: such as the right to be the only wife of their spouse, to refuse to consummate their marriage until they were ready and to contract a divorce when they pleased. Due to many of them marrying as children and being widowed and divorced several times, often for political reasons, remarriages were very common. Fatma Sultan and her sister, Ay≈üe Sultan, are extreme examples of this: they were married at least seven and six times, and entered into their last engagement at the ages of 61 and 50, respectively. Marriages = First marriage = During the reign of her brother Sultan Murad IV, Fatma Sultan married Kara Mustafa Pasha. She was widowed in 1628, when Kara Mustafa Pasha was executed by her brother, Murad, for some action \\"contrary to the law of God.\\" = Second, third and fourth marriage = Upon the execution of her first husband, she married Sarrac Hasan Pasha. After the death of her second husband, she married Canpoladzade Mustafa Pasha. He was executed by the orders of her brother, Murad in 1635-6. After the death of her third spouse, Fatma Sultan married Koca Yusuf Pasha. In 1643, early in the reign of her brother Sultan Ibrahim, Fatma is recorded, like her sisters Ay≈üe Sultan and Hanzade Sultan, as receiving the maximum daily stipend for imperial princesses of the time, namely 400 aspers. In 1647, the three of them as well as their niece, Murad's daughter Kaya Sultan, were subjected, on what was another assault of the protocol on Ibrahim's part, to the indignity of subordination to his concubines. He took away their lands and jewels (presumably to award them to his Hasekis), and made them serve H√ºma≈üah Sultan, the concubine he married, by standing at attention like servants while she ate and fetching and holding the soap, basin and pitcher of water with which she washed her hands. Because of what he believed was failure to serve his beloved H√ºma≈üah properly, the Sultan then banished them to Edirne Palace. = Fifth marriage = One of the most noted of the seven marriages of Fatma was her marriage to Melek Ahmed Pasha, previously married to her niece, Kaya Sultan, in 1662. By that time, she was in her late fifties. The marriage was forcibly arranged against the wishes of both parties, and unhappy, and Melek Ahmed Pasha accused the Grand Vizier K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed Pasha of having arranged it to punish him. The Grand Vizier himself joked that he had given Melek Ahmed Pasha an elephant to feed. On the wedding night, Fatma presented Melek Ahmed Pasha her demand of what allowance she wished for herself and her court. He replied that the amount was impossible, upon which she replied that divorce was the only alternative, and demanded he return her dowry to her, which amounted to one year of taxes of Egypt (this was possibly related to the fact that one of her previous husbands, the late Kara Mustafa Pasha, had formerly been a governor of the Egypt province of the Ottoman Empire and was reported to have been forced to pay back the tax proceeds that he had embezzled during his term). When she was widowed in 1662 shortly thereafter, she sealed his residence and claimed the right to his property, which caused a conflict with the Grand Vizier, who was forced to give in to her demands. = Sixth and seventh marriage = In June 1663, Fatma Sultan married Vezir Kanbur Mustafa Pasha, the Beylerbeyi of Baghdad. After his death in 1666, she married the Beylerbeyi of Silistre Vezir K√∂zbek√ßi Yusuf Pasha on 5 September 1667. =Charity= Fatma Sultan built a fountain on the road around the Ahmed Pa≈üa Mosque in Topkapƒ±.

As a player, he was a goalkeeper for FC Volendam for more than a decade, before going into coaching as an assistant to Louis van Gaal at club sides AFC Ajax, FC Barcelona, FC Bayern Munich and Manchester United, and the Netherlands national team. He also worked for the Poland national team under fellow Dutchman Leo Beenhakker. He has worked with goalkeepers including Edwin van der Sar, Stanley Menzo, V√≠ctor Vald√©s, V√≠tor Ba√≠a, Pepe Reina, Robert Enke, ≈Åukasz Fabia≈Ñski, Thomas Kraft, Michel Vorm and David de Gea. Hoek is widely regarded as one of world football's foremost goalkeeping mentors. Playing career Starting as an amateur goalkeeper at SV Always Forward, Hoek played in goal at FC Volendam from 1973 to 1985, and in 1977 he achieved top flight football for the first time in the club's history. Two years later, Volendam were relegated. In 1983, Hoek and his teammates were promoted back to the Eredivisie, where they spent another two seasons. Hoek scored against Roda JC Kerkrade in September 1983. In 1985, Hoek ended his playing career as a goalkeeper, moving into coaching. Coaching career Hoek joined Ajax in 1986 as a coach, working under manager Johan Cruyff, and in 1991 became the goalkeeping coach of manager Louis van Gaal at the club. A young Edwin van der Sar was under the care of Hoek at Ajax. In between this, he also coached for two years the goalkeepers of his former club Volendam. In 1997, he followed van Gaal to Barcelona, where he oversaw the promotion of V√≠ctor Vald√©s. He moved with van Gaal to the Netherlands national football team in 2000, and back to Barcelona again in 2002. From 2005 he was for four years the goalkeeping coach of the Poland national football team, under manager Leo Beenhakker, where he went to the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. Beenhakker had been the former head coach at Volendam, where Hoek spent his playing career. Following this, Hoek joined van Gaal again at Bayern Munich in 2010, where he received both the role of goalkeeping coach and an assistant coach. After van Gaal left Germany in 2011, the pair took over the Netherlands national football team (for the second time), going to UEFA Euro 2012 in Poland/Ukraine and the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. Hoek again teamed up with van Gaal at Manchester United in the summer of 2014, replacing Chris Woods as the club's chief goalkeeping coach. Ryan Giggs became assistant manager, Albert Stuivenberg was added as assistant coach, and Marcel Bout was appointed as an assistant coach and chief opposition scout, the latter previously worked with Hoek at Bayern Munich. Hoek also trains other professional goalkeeping coaches, and advises and lectures for FIFA, UEFA and the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB), among others, on goalkeeping. He previously advised Manchester United (before becoming chief goalkeeping coach), LA Galaxy and the Danish Football Association (DBU). His coaching style is known within the game as the \\"Hoek Method\\". As of 2016, he is the goalkeeping coach of Galatasaray SK and the Netherlands national football team.

She was instrumental in restoring the Benson Grist Mill as a historical site in Tooele County, Utah. She has served on several advisory boards and committees. Biography Maxine Tate was born in Tooele, Utah, the eldest child of Joseph Earl Tate and Bertha (n√©e Shields) Tate. Her lineage on both sides could be traced to pioneer stock who had walked across the plains to help settle the Utah desert. Two of her grandfathers, John Shields and Samuel Lee, laid out the first boundaries of Tooele City. She attended public schools in Tooele, graduating as high school valedictorian in 1932. Her mother died that year, so Grimm delayed college plans to remain at home and care for her younger siblings. She later enrolled at the University of Utah, graduating in 1937 with a BA in retailing and business. She then obtained an MA from New York University, after which she returned to Utah as a buyer for ZCMI. In 1939 she married Veldon Shields, a Tooele-born Utah attorney.

Her boss was Jewish, and as World War II began engulfing Europe, he worked at smuggling refugees out and finding places for them in New York. Grimm was soon also involved in this activity. The attack on Pearl Harbor motivated her to become more directly involved in the war effort, so she joined the Red Cross. After training at Fort Bragg, she was shipped overseas. Her first assignment was a New Guinea hospital. In the Philippines After New Guinea, Grimm was assigned to assist in setting up a refugee camp in the Philippines. Her main assignment in the Red Cross was to maintain troop morale, providing recreation leadership and vocational counseling. After the US wrested control of the country from the Japanese invaders, she took over a studio of the former Japanese-controlled Radio Manila which had been used to broadcast anti- American propaganda,See Tokyo Rose for a description of such wartime broadcasts. and used it to do public relations work for the Red Cross. She also took opportunity to mention her LDS heritage, and when an opportunity arose to travel to Utah, she obtained recordings of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and other publicity materials to broadcast on her radio shows. During the war she had met US Army Colonel Edward Miller \\"Pete\\" Grimm, who had lived in the Philippines prior to the war. They were married in Erda, Utah in 1947,Col. Grimm had two female children from a previous marriage. See G.R. No. L-55509 and they lived in Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong as well as in the Philippines. She returned to Tooele each time to bear her two children, Linda and Edward Miller Grimm II (\\"Pete\\"), then returned to the Philippines to her husband. Her husband died on November 27, 1977 in the Makati Medical Center, while they were living in the Philippines. G.R. No. L-55509, April 27, 1984 Grimm and her husband contacted leaders of the LDS Church after the war, requesting them to send missionaries to the area. They helped set up branches of the church to aid members of the church who were stationed in the Philippines with the US military. Most of the first LDS baptisms in the area were performed in the Grimms' swimming pool.A Life Well Lived, Tooele Transcript-Bulletin, May 15, 2014, p. B1 In recognition of her efforts, future church president Gordon B. Hinckley lauded her work in the Philippines when speaking to the BYU student body in March 1977, a few months before her husband died. Speeches of the Year, March 6, 1977 After the Philippines After her husband died, Grimm and her children split their time between the Philippines and Tooele. She returned to Tooele full-time in 1988, and devoted her time to community affairs. She served as a member of the BYU Roundtable, chaired the Tooele County Museum, sat on the Salt Lake Opera board, and was asked to chair the Utah State Centennial Commission (1995‚Äì96). Every LDS Church president since David O. McKay has visited the Grimms, either in the Philippines or in Tooele.Tooele Transcript-Bulletin, May 15, 2014, p. B8 Even before returning to Tooele full-time, Grimm became involved in the effort to save the Benson Grist Mill. With committee chairman Jack Smith, they were able to have ownership of the property transferred to the County and have county funds applied to its restoration. She helped to write a script for the Benson Gristmill Pageant, which tells how the Tooele Valley was settled. Grimm died on February 10, 2017 at the age of 102. Honors Grimm chaired the County's Safe at Home committee in 2005.

Both nations are members of Organization of Islamic Cooperation. Indonesia and Qatar have both signed a number of memorandums of understanding in fields like air transport, tourism, and agricultural cooperation. High level visits Because of its oil and natural gas resources, Qatar is among the world's richest countries. Indonesian president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, paid a state visit in 2006 to Doha, to attract Qatari businesses to invest in Indonesia, while Qatar's emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, visited Jakarta in 2009. During the Bali Democracy Forum IV in December 2011, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani met with Yudhoyono once again. Trade and investment The total of bilateral trade volume in 2011 reached US$683.6 million, which was a 5.2% increase compared to those of 2010. The trade balance was heavily in favor to Qatar that over the years has booked trade surpluses over Indonesia. This is due to two main factors; first, the population and demographics of Qatar is too small to generate demands for Indonesian products, while the second is the seemingly perpetual increase of Indonesian need for oil, making the latter's imports almost solely related to oil. Indonesian exports to Qatar include furniture, office supplies, paper, electrical appliances, and home appliances. Indonesia is among Qatar's investment destinations. In May 2010, Qatar Holdings, an investment arm of the Qatar Investment Authority, established an Indonesian fund worth $1 billion. A Qatari telecommunications company Qtel currently has a 65 percent stake in Indonesia‚Äôs second largest telecommunications company, PT Indosat, worth more than US$3 billion. A number of Indonesian companies have also invested in Qatar, almost all of them being oil-related, including Indonesian state oil company PT Pertamina which operates Qatar‚Äôs Sector-3 oil and gas block. Migrant workers Currently, there are around 40 thousand Indonesians working in Qatar. Some of them work in the oil sector, while others work as domestic helpers. Qatar seeks skilled and trained workers from Indonesia, especially oil workers and nurses. According to Indonesian Ministry of Workers in early 2014, Qatar has posted a request for skilled Indonesian workers to fill thousands of jobs available there.

He is the son of original Beach Boy Al Jardine. Biography Jardine is the son of longtime Beach Boys guitarist Al Jardine. His first major recording was at the age of 11 and was the narration of the Beach Boys' recording of \\"(I Saw Santa) Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree\\" from the album Christmas with the Beach Boys. Jardine, alongside the other Beach Boys' children (the \\"Adam\\" referred to in the narration was his younger brother, Adam Jardine, age six), sang the background vocals on this song. During the 1980s, Jardine spent time on the road with the Beach Boys as a gofer to earn money. This led to an assistant road manager job in the summer of 1988, which he retained until Carl Wilson asked if he could play percussion onstage while continuing his other duties. During this tour Jardine was asked to sing background vocals on a part-time basis filling in for other vocalists in the band, whose voices had grown tired due to the band's year-round touring schedule. In 1991, Jardine auditioned for the band and earned a spot in the band as a lead and falsetto vocalist, background singer and percussionist. He toured with the Beach Boys from 1990 through 1998, performing on three of their studio albums. Jardine sang Brian Wilson's original falsetto vocals on tour; these songs included \\"Warmth of the Sun\\", \\"Don't Worry Baby\\", and \\"Hushabye\\". He has appeared in nine Beach Boys' music videos and made numerous TV appearances. During the latter part of his time with the Beach Boys, Jardine also worked extensively with Mike Love's California Beach Band. He also toured with Jan and Dean for numerous shows and events. In 1998, Jardine was asked to perform with Brian Wilson on TNT's Front Row and Center as well as Farm Aid '98. Wilson was quoted as saying of Jardine in Billboard magazine, \\"I hear him from behind the stage. His voice is stronger than mine, and he can actually hit those high notes.\\" Jardine later went on the road with Brian's daughters Carnie and Wendy Wilson and friend Chynna Phillips, the multi- platinum trio Wilson Phillips, to help them promote their California album. Carnie and Wendy were not only childhood friends but had also worked with Jardine and his father while touring as Alan Jardine's Family and Friends following their departure from the Beach Boys touring band in 1998. Jardine has continued to tour with his father and the Surf City All-Stars. In 2014, he was asked to join the Brian Wilson touring band, replacing Jeff Foskett; he accepted.

LEADER I ran from 1991‚Äì93, LEADER II from 1994‚Äì99, and LEADER+ from 2000-2006. In the current programming period (2014-2020), the LEADER method has been extended to cover not only rural but also coastal (FARNET) and urban areas under the banner of Community- led Local Development (CLLD).  Operation and objectives  LEADER+ projects are managed by local action groups (LAGs). Each project must involve a relatively small rural area, with a population of between 10,000 and 100,000. In France, the whole country is eligible with the exception of urban areas with over 50,000 inhabitants. France has 140 local action groups. LEADER+ has three objectives: * to encourage experiments in rural development * to support cooperation between rural territories: several LAGs can share their resources * to network rural areas, by sharing experiences and expertise in the development of rural areas by creating databases, publications and other modes of information exchange  Methodology From 1991 until 2001 the LEADER methodology was developed with the support of the European Commission's technical assistance contractor, AEIDL. LEADER developed seven principles of local development. The 7 principles of the LEADER local development approach These are: # Area-based: taking place in a small, homogeneous socially cohesive territory # Bottom-up: local actors design the strategy and choose the actions # Public-private partnership: LAGs are balanced groups involving public and private-sector actors, which can mobilise all available skills and resources # Innovation: giving LAGs the flexibility to introduce new ideas and methods # Integration: between economic, social, cultural and environmental actions, as distinct from a sectoral approach # Networking: allowing learning among people, organisations and institutions at local, regional, national and European levels # Co-operation: among LEADER groups, for instance to share experiences, allow complementarity or to achieve critical mass Funding * LEADER I (1991‚Äì93) supported 217 LAGS with EU funding of ‚Ç¨0.442 billion from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF)European Commission, The Leader approach ‚Äî A basic guide, Luxembourg: Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, 2006, * LEADER II (1994‚Äì99) supported 906 LAGs with EU funding of ‚Ç¨1.755 billion * LEADER+ (2000‚Äì06) supported 893 LAGs with EU funding of ‚Ç¨2.105 billion, and a total budget of ‚Ç¨5.05 billion Follow-up In 2013 the LEADER approach, which had developed in a rural context, was extended to apply to urban and coastal areas under the title of Community-Led Local Development (CLLD).

AMCHA was founded in 2012 by University of California Santa Cruz lecturer Tammi Rossman- Benjamin and University of California Los Angeles Professor Emeritus Leila Beckwith. The term Amcha is Hebrew for \\"your people\\" or \\"your nation.\\" AMCHA has been criticized for conflating anti-Semitism with condemnation of Israel and for bullying faculty members.  Finances  In 2014, The Forward wrote that AMCHA raised $200,000 in its first year and spent $100,000. In 2018 Israeli-American journalist Mairav Zonszein reviewed of San Francisco Jewish Federation's tax filings. According to her review, the Federation and the Helen Diller Family Foundation has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to AMCHA in recent years. Adam Milstein's Milstein Family Foundation is also one of AMCHA's donors.  Mission statement  AMCHA describes its mission as \\"investigating, documenting, educating about, and combating antisemitism at institutions of higher education in America.\\"https://amchainitiative.org/about/ The organization has a \\"research arm\\" that \\"carries out systematic, in-depth research and analysis of antisemitic activity and has developed a comprehensive method for defining, documenting, and analyzing manifestations of antisemitic behavior on campus, as well as the institutional structures that legitimize it and allow it to flourish.\\" The organization further writes that:https://amchainitiative.org/  Views  AMCHA actively opposes the BDS movement, which has enjoyed some success on U.S. campuses. BDS calls for comprehensive boycotts of Israel until it stops its alleged human rights violations against the Palestinians. AMCHA believes that BDS is anti-Semitic. It therefore wants universities to adopt the State Department's definition of anti-Semitism which, according to AMCHA, would classify many students' pro-BDS activities as anti-Semitic. For example, campus protests erecting walls to symbolize the Israeli West Bank barrier and demonstrations distributing mock eviction notices to highlight Israeli house demolitions against Palestinians would both be deemed as anti-Semitic, according to the organization.  Publications  = Reports = As of 2020, AMCHA has produced 15 reports which it lists on its website. Those that have been mentioned in media are: * Bringing BDS into the Classroom, a report from 2020 which claimed that faculty who support BDS are promoting that agenda in classrooms. * The Harassment of Jewish Students on U.S. Campuses, a report from 2019 which claimed that anti-Semitic harassment of pro-Israel students had increased by 70%, to its highest level ever. * An annual report from 2018, which claimed that \\"anti-Israel harassment on college campuses in 2017 were more likely to create an antagonistic environment against Jewish students on campus than ‚Äòclassic‚Äô anti-Semitic incidents.\\" * An annual report from 2017, which claimed to have uncovered a correlation between anti-Semitism and pro- BDS activism on campuses. * Another report from 2017 that claimed that 70% of pro-BDS professors were associated with gender studies, ethnic studies, or Middle East studies. * Two reports in 2015 and 2016, both claimed that anti- Semitism on campuses were correlated with BDS activity. = Database of alleged anti-Semitism on campuses = AMCHA publishes a database of incidents on American campuses that it considers anti-Semitic, starting with incidents from 2015. The database and other trackers by the organization have been used by media to cite anti-Semitic activity and swastika sightings on various campuses including at Stanford University, Bowdoin College as well as across the nation. = Student Voices webpage = AMCHA maintains a webpage that lists quotes detailing the experiences of Jewish students on American campuses who have been \\"targeted, intimidated or frightened because they are Jewish.\\" The quotes were collected starting in 2014. The webpage had more than 100 students, located at 47 different schools, in 20 states as of June 24, 2015. The quotes are gathered from publications nationwide including school papers. = Blacklisting of professors = In 2014, AMCHA began blacklisting professors who support the academic boycott of Israeli educational institutions. That summer, a bloody conflict between Israel and Hamas raged that killed over 2,000 Palestininians and Israel was condemned over its heavy- handedness. 218 Middle East studies professors signed a petition lambasting \\"[t]he on-going Israeli massacres in Gaza\\" and condemning media and governments for not holding \\"Israel accountable for its violations of international law.\\" These professors were added to AMCHA's blacklist and AMCHA warned students that their classes might contain \\"anti-Israel bias, or possibly even anti-Semitic rhetoric.\\" A group of 40 Jewish Studies professors signed a statement calling AMCHA's actions \\"deplorable\\" and an inappropriate attempt to stifle academic debate. Despite the criticism, the blacklist continues to be updated. In 2017, Haaretz reported that the list included hundreds of names. The universities that topped the list were UC Berkeley with 47 names and UC Davis with 46. Critics feared that AMCHA's list would be used by the Israeli government to deny entry to boycott supporters.  Campaigns  = UC Hastings conference about Palestine (2011) = In 2011, UC Hastings College of Law funded and co-sponsored a conference \\"Litigating Palestine: Can Courts Secure Palestinian Rights?\\" One day before the conference was due to begin, Rossman-Benjamin co-wrote a letter to University Chancellor Frank H. Wu, with copies sent to Jewish leaders and politicians, alleging that the event was anti-Semitic according to the Working Definition of anti-Semitism and threatening to file a Title VI complaint with the Department of Education. The university's Board of Directors held an emergency meeting and decided to remove its name from the event, the dean cancelled his opening address and the private Cummings Foundation withdrew its funding, though the event was held as planned. Kenneth S. Stern (one of the original drafters of the Working Definition) and Marcus Stern authored a statement by the American Jewish Committee criticizing Rossman-Benjamin: = Spying on the Olive Tree Initiative (2012) = In 2014, the pro-Palestinian website The Electronic Intifada released a trove of leaked documents that showed that AMCHA in 2012 infiltrated a student trip to Palestine organized by the Olive Tree Initiative, an organization promoting dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians. According to the documents, one of the students on the trip recorded private conversations between the students and reported back the information to Rossman-Benjamin. = CSUN Complaint about professor's website (2012-2014) = Over several years, AMCHA campaigned against mathematics professor David Klein at California State University Northridge (CSUN) who published a webpage critical of Israel and pro-BDS on his university website. AMCHA submitted memos and complaints, first to CSUN administrators and later to Californian legal authorities regarding Klein's page, but the professor was found not to have violated any CSUN rules nor any law. CSUN president Dianne F. Harrison addressed the complaints in May 2012, writing: \\"To censor the website would be contrary to the important value of free speech and send the disturbing message that the university is willing to restrict an individual‚Äôs right to personal expression due to disagreement with those views.\\" = SFSU Killing colonizers stencil (2013) = In 2013, the General Union of Palestine Students (GUPS) and an indigenous group at San Francisco State University had set up a table at an event honoring an Edward Said memorial. At the table they had brought stencils for passerbys to make signs with. One of the stencils read: \\"My heroes have always killed colonizers,\\" a phrase about indigenous resistance to colonization. There was also images of Leila Khaled holding a gun. AMCHA accused GUPS of \\"glorifying the murder of Jews\\" and demanded that the university must investigate and punish the students. The university released a statement supportive of AMCHA's charges, stating that \\"celebrating violence or promoting intolerance, bigotry, antisemitism or any other form of hate mongering\\" would not be tolerated at SFSU. But following a public outcry, the university issued a second statement underscoring \\"that social justice is a strategic priority and our commitment to free speech runs deep.\\" = SFSU Threatening Tumblr posts (2013) = In 2013, Rossman-Benjamin uncovered some threatening Tumblr posts by the President of GUPS at SFSU. One was a photo of the student holding a knife, with the caption: \\"I love this blade... it makes me want to stab an Israeli soldier.‚Äù Another was of an Israeli soldier with the caption \\"the only ‚Äúpeace‚Äù I'm interested in is the head of this fcking scum on a plate, as well as the heads of all others like her, and all others who support the IDF.\\" AMCHA forwarded the material to the university and the police. In February 2014, university officials announced that the student had withdrawn from the university before the spring semester had begun on January 23 and that he was no longer enrolled nor living in campus housing. = UCLA Opposition to pledge against sponsored Israel-trips (2014) = In 2014 Students for Justice in Palestine and allied groups at UCLA asked candidates for student government positions to pledge to not go on trips to Israel sponsored by AIPAC, the Anti-Defamation League, or Hasbara Fellowships. In response, Rossman-Benjamin coordinated a joint letter undersigned by AMCHA and six other pro-Israel organizations, condemning the pledge as an \\"outrageous and impermissible violation of students‚Äô right to free expression, their right to free association and their fundamental right to travel and move freely.\\" The letter was delivered to the UC Board of Regents, University President Janet Napolitano and Chancellor Gene Block. Soon thereafter, Block and Napolitano condemned the pledge and asked the VP of Student Affairs to intervene. = SFSU Complaint about scholar's trip (2014) = On March 6, 2014, San Francisco State University (SFSU) Professor Rabab Abdulhadi held a campus event to discuss with students what she had learned from a trip funded by the university to Palestine and Jordan. The purpose of the trip had been to attend an international conference and to network, research, and collaborate with potential university partners in Palestine. The day before Abdulhadi's campus event, AMCHA sent a letter to university president Leslie Wong, claiming that the event would \\"contribute to a hostile environment for Jewish students.\\" On March 26, AMCHA sent another letter, claiming that following the event, observers had seen Jewish students \\"in tears.\\" Rossman-Benjamin also accused Abdulhadi of having defrauded the state of California: \\"We believe that there was some fraud going on in order to get the money, approval, insurance, she essentially defrauded the state and the taxpayers of California.\\" Her primary complaint was that Abdulhadi had met with the controversial Islamic preacher Raed Salah and Leila Khaled. She therefore coordinated a letter from eight pro-Israel organizations to the university administration demanding an investigation into the matter. Abdulhadi defended herself by noting that on the trip they met with 198 individuals from 89 organizations and that dialogue with controversial figures was an important part of academia. The university reviewed the records for Abdulhadi's travel and issued a statement in June dismissing the allegations as meritless. The statement underscored that \\"Abdulhadi‚Äôs academic work in race and resistance studies requires examination of some of the world‚Äôs most challenging and controversial issues\\" and that the university \\"will not censor our scholars nor condone censorship by others.\\" Dissatisfied, AMCHA recited the allegations against Abdulhadi in a June 24 letter addressed to the California State Controller but the Controller's office took no action on the complaint. = UC Events featuring Omar Barghouti (2014) = In mid-January 2014, the co-founder of BDS, Omar Barghouti, was scheduled to speak at three UC schools; UCLA, UC Riverside, and UC Davis. AMCHA alleged that sponsoring Barghouti's presentations violated UC policies and state law. UC leadership responded by stating that they were not in support of a boycott of Israel, but considered Barghouti's presentations to be free speech. In a meeting with UC Board of Regents following Barghouti's speaking arrangements, Tammi-Benjamin alleged that the three events included \\"appalling anti-Semitic statements.\\" = UC Berkeley course on Palestine (2016) = In 2016, AMCHA led a campaign involving 43 Jewish and pro-Israel organizations in opposing a student-led course titled \\"Ethnic Studies 198: Palestine: A Settler Colonial Analysis.\\" AMCHA alleged that the course was \\"political indoctrination\\" and that the guest speakers were \\"politically motivated, meet our government‚Äôs criteria for antisemitism, and are intended to indoctrinate students to hate the Jewish state and take action to eliminate it.\\" Jonathan Greenblatt of the Anti- Defamation League joined in on the criticism and called the course a \\"travesty\\" and \\"distortion of history.\\" One fierce critic, professor emeritus Abraham H. Miller of the Haym Salomon Center, called the course faculty sponsor, Hatem Bazian, \\"a street orator whose disgust with America is such that he called for an American Intifada.\\" The campaign was initially successful and the course was suspended. University Chancellor Nicholas Dirks wrote: But following criticism from Palestine Legal and other pro-Palestinian organizations the University reinstated the course. = UC Linking anti- Zionism to anti-Semitism (2015-2016) = AMCHA led a year-long lobbying campaign, uniting over 50 pro-Israeli organizations, to get UC to label anti- Zionism as a form of anti-Semitism. On March 22, 2016, the Regents of UC passed a Statement of Principles Against Intolerance which included the statement, \\"Anti-Semitism, anti-Semitic forms of anti-Zionism and other forms of discrimination have no place at the University of California.\\" Rossman- Benjamin celebrated the statement, calling it huge,\\" while critics condemned it. Dima Khalidi, the director of Palestine Legal, said that pro-Israeli groups had \\"succeeded in convincing the regents that Palestine advocacy is inherently anti-Semitic, and should be condemned.\\" = Campaign against the academic boycott of Israel (2018-2019) = AMCHA Initiative launched a campaign involving more than 100 Jewish pro-Israel organizations to get American education-leaders to sign a letter voicing their opposition to BDS. In response to the campaign, on December 13, 2019, all ten UC Chancellors signed onto a statement that reaffirmed their opposition to the academic boycott of Israel.  Criticism  AMCHA has been criticized for conflating anti-Semitism with condemnation of Israel and for bullying people with whom it disagrees. In 2013, a video surfaced showing parts of a presentation AMCHA's president, Rossman-Benjamin had held the previous year in a synagogue. In the presentation, she described members of the campus groups Muslim Student Association (MSA) and Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) as \\"generally motivated by very strong religious and political convictions, they have a fire in their belly, they come to the university, many of them are foreign students who come from countries and cultures where anti-Semitism is how they think about the world,\\" adding that \\"[t]hese are not your ordinary student groups like College Republicans or Young Democrats.\\" She further asserted that students in these groups had ties to terrorist organizations such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Muslim Brotherhood. Many students reacted strongly to the video and students petitioned the university president Mark Yudof to condemn Rossman-Benjamin's statement and to cut ties with AMCHA. Rossman-Benjamin responded by claiming that the petition constituted harassment and that she feared for her safety. She wrote to Yudof claiming that her words were being misconstrued and asked him to \\"carefully investigate\\" MSA and SJP to see if there were any policies that they violated. In February 2014, the National Lawyers Guild accused AMCHA of concocting \\"demonstrably false narratives about specific campus events involving criticism of Israeli government policies, describing them as if they targeted, even violently so, Jewish students,\\" for painting a picture of campuses \\"in which Jewish students are under constant attack,\\" for attacking \\"academic freedom of faculty members,\\" and for \\"proffering outlandish accusations against academic departments that sponsor speakers with whom they disagree\\". In June 2014, the Dean of Ethnic Studies at SFSU, Kenneth Monteiro, accused AMCHA of bullying one of the faculty's professors: In October 2014, a group of Jewish studies professors wrote in The Forward: Palestine Legal in 2016 wrote about its founder: \\"Tammi Rossman Benjamin, have a demonstrated record of demanding that universities restrict, punish, and censor speech in favor Palestinian rights. Under the banner of 'combating antisemitism at institutions of higher education,' AMCHA‚Äôs single- minded mission is a concerted anti-intellectual effort to silence any criticism of Israel on campuses.\\" In 2020, a group calling themselves California Scholars for Academic Freedom wrote a letter to the California Department of Education complaining about AMCHA:  References   External links  * Category:Jewish community organizations Category:Jewish educational organizations Category:Jewish-American political organizations Category:Opposition to antisemitism in the United States Category:Think tanks established in 2011 Category:2011 establishments in California Category:Charities based in California ","title":"AMCHA Initiative"},{"id":"42804111","text":"Oswald Freisler (29 December 1895 in Hamelin ‚Äì 4 March 1939 in Berlin) was a lawyer in Nazi Germany and the brother of the Judge President of the People's Court, Roland Freisler. Life Freisler attended Gymnasium in Aachen and Kassel, where in 1914 he passed his Abitur. He studied law in Kiel, Frankfurt and G√∂ttingen. In February 1924, he opened a law firm with his brother Roland Freisler in Kassel. Oswald Freisler joined the Nazi Party in 1927 and was a member of the National Socialist Association of Legal Professionals. From 1933 he was Gauf√ºhrer in Kassel and a member of the Academy for German Law, and in the same year he became president of the bar association in Kassel. In 1936, he took over the Berlin office of Jewish lawyer Johannes Werthauer, who left Germany in 1933 in order to teach at the Sorbonne. Although a Nazi, Freisler appeared as defence counsel in politically significant trials which the Nazis sought to use for propaganda purposes. He even wore his Nazi Party badge in court, which led to confusion over the Party's role in the trials. In 1937, on behalf of the Catholic Church, Freisler took over the defence of three co- defendants in the trial of Joseph C. Rossaint, a resistance fighter against National Socialism, and won an acquittal, much to the displeasure of the Nazi Party. In response, Joseph Goebbels asked Adolf Hitler to personally exclude Freisler from the party. On 30 April 1937, Goebbels noted with satisfaction, \\"Freisler expelled from the party by the F√ºhrer.\\" In 1939, Freisler mysteriously committed suicide in Berlin after he had been accused of irregularities in the conduct of a defence. There are three versions of Freisler's death. One is that he threw himself out of the window of his office, another is that the incident occurred in prison, and the third version is that he injected himself with an overdose of insulin.G.

Education  Kraft received a B.A. from Harvard University in 1971. He holds an M.A. in Asian Languages and Cultures from the University of Michigan (1978) and a Ph.D. in East Asian Studies from Princeton University (1984).  Career  In 1984, Kraft became a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard's Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies. He joined the Lehigh University faculty in 1990 and was appointed a full professor in 2001. At Lehigh he has served as chair of the Religion Studies department and director of the College Seminar Program. He was a visiting professor at the Stanford University Japan Center and a visiting scholar at the International Research Institute for Zen Buddhism, both in Kyoto. He also taught at the University of Pennsylvania and Swarthmore College. Kraft has served on the advisory boards of the Buddhist Peace Fellowship in Berkeley, California; the Forum on Religion and Ecology at Yale University; the Journal of Buddhist Ethics; the Rochester Zen Center; and the World Faiths Development Dialogue in Washington DC. In 1992, he was featured in \\"The Creative Spirit,\\" a PBS television series. In 2008, he participated in \\"Secrets of the Samurai Sword,\\" a NOVA documentary, and, in 2009, \\"Inquiry into the Great Matter: A History of Zen Buddhism,\\" an independent film. In his early research, Kraft explored the transmission of Zen from China to Japan in the 13th and 14th centuries. Zen master Dait≈ç, a seminal figure in this process, is best known as an exemplar of post-enlightenment training. Kraft documented Dait≈ç's life, his teaching, and his role in the development of capping phrases (jakugo), a form of spiritual/literary commentary. The transmission of Zen from Asia to the West accelerated after World War II. In 1988, Kraft edited Zen: Tradition and Transition, a collaboration by present-day Zen teachers and scholars. It addressed some of the same issues that had arisen in Dait≈ç's era: What is real Zen? What are the criteria of authenticity? Buddhism's encounter with the West in the 20th century inspired an international movement known as engaged Buddhism. Its leaders include the 14th Dalai Lama and Th√≠ch Nh·∫•t H·∫°nh. Kraft began writing about engaged Buddhism in the mid-1980s, at the height of the Cold War. Some of the underlying concerns can be framed as questions: What do Buddhist ethical principles signify today? What is the relation between work on oneself and work in the world? Does Buddhist nonviolence call for unwavering opposition to war, or are there exceptions? Some observers challenge the apparent newness of engaged Buddhism. Columbia University scholar Thomas Yarnall has criticized the work of Kraft and other \\"modernists\\" who \\"appropriate, own, and reinvent Buddhism from the ground up.\\" In Yarnall's view, engaged Buddhism should be seen as a revival of original Buddhism, which was more engaged than is usually assumed.Queen, Christopher (2003). Action Dharma: New Studies in Engaged Buddhism. Routledge. pp. 295-. . Keown, Damien; Prebish, Charles S. (2004). Encyclopedia of Buddhism. Routledge, p. 318\\\\. . Buddhism may have resources that are freshly relevant in a time of ecological crisis. Dharma Rain: Sources of Buddhist Environmentalism, an anthology coedited in 2000 by Kraft and Stephanie Kaza, was an early contribution to an emerging field.  Awards and honors  Kraft's 1992 book Eloquent Zen: Dait≈ç and Early Japanese Zen was selected as an \\"Outstanding Academic Book\\" by Choice magazine. In 2005, he received a Lindback Foundation Award for distinguished teaching by a senior member of the Lehigh University faculty.  Books  * Zen: Tradition and Transition. Grove Press, 1988. Editor. .

Consisting of more than 20 sub-classes, RiPPs are produced by a variety of organisms, including prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and archaea, and they possess a wide range of biological functions. As a consequence of the falling cost of genome sequencing and the accompanying rise in available genomic data, scientific interest in RiPPs has increased in the last few decades. Because the chemical structures of RiPPs are more closely predictable from genomic data than are other natural products (e.g. alkaloids, terpenoids), their presence in sequenced organisms can, in theory, be identified rapidly. This makes RiPPs an attractive target of modern natural product discovery efforts. Definition RiPPs consist of any peptides (i.e. molecular weight below 10 kDa) that are ribosomally-produced and undergo some degree of enzymatic post-translational modification. This combination of peptide translation and modification is referred to as \\"post-ribosomal peptide synthesis\\" (PRPS) in analogy with nonribosomal peptide synthesis (NRPS). Historically, the current sub-classes of RiPPs were studied individually, and common practices in nomenclature varied accordingly in the literature. More recently, with the advent of broad genome sequencing, it has been realized that these natural products share a common biosynthetic origin. In 2013, a set of uniform nomenclature guidelines were agreed upon and published by a large group of researchers in the field. Prior to this report, RiPPs were referred to by a variety of designations, including post-ribosomal peptides, ribosomal natural products, and ribosomal peptides. The acronym \\"RiPP\\" stands for \\"ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide\\". Prevalence and applications RiPPs constitute one of the major superfamilies of natural products, like alkaloids, terpenoids, and nonribosomal peptides, although they tend to be large, with molecular weights commonly in excess of 1000 Da. The advent of next-generation sequencing methods has made genome mining of RiPPs a common strategy. In part due to their increased discovery and hypothesized ease of engineering, the use of RiPPs as drugs is increasing. Although they are ribosomal peptides in origin, RiPPs are typically categorized as small molecules rather than biologics due to their chemical properties, such as moderate molecular weight and relatively high hydrophobicity. The uses and biological activities of RiPPs are diverse. RiPPs in commercial use include nisin, a food preservative, thiostrepton, a veterinary topical antibiotic, and nosiheptide and duramycin, which are animal feed additives. Phalloidin functionalized with a fluorophore is used in microscopy as a stain due to its high affinity for actin. Anantin is a RiPP used in cell biology as an atrial natriuretic peptide receptor inhibitor. A derivatized RiPP in clinical trials is LFF571. LFF571, a derivative of the thiopeptide GE2270-A, completed phase II clinical trials for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infections, with comparable safety and efficacy to vancomycin. Also recently in clinical trials was the NVB302 (a derivative of the lantibiotic actagardine) which is used for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection. Duramycin has completed phase II clinical trials for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. Other bioactive RiPPs include the antibiotics cyclothiazomycin and bottromycin, the ultra-narrow spectrum antibiotic plantazolicin, and the cytotoxin patellamide A. Streptolysin S, the toxic virulence factor of Streptococcus pyogenes, is also a RiPP. Additionally, human thyroid hormone itself is a RiPP due to its biosynthetic origin as thyroglobulin. Classifications = Amatoxins and phallotoxins = The structure of Œ±-amanitin, with posttranslational modifications particular to the amatoxins and phallotoxins shown in red. Amatoxins and phallotoxins are 8- and 7-membered natural products, respectively, characterized by N-to-C cyclization in addition to a tryptathionine motif derived from the crosslinking of Cys and Trp. The amatoxins and phallotoxins also differ from other RiPPs based on the presence of a C-terminal recognition sequence in addition to the N-terminal leader peptide. Œ±-Amanitin, an amatoxin, has a number of posttranslational modifications in addition to macrocyclization and formation of the tryptathionine bridge: oxidation of the tryptathionine leads to the presence of a sulfoxide, and numerous hydroxylations decorate the natural product. As an amatoxin, Œ±-amanitin is an inhibitor of RNA polymerase II. =Bottromycins= Structure of Bottromycin A2 with characteristic posttranslational modifications highlighted in red Bottromycins contain a C-terminal decarboxylated thiazole in addition to a macrocyclic amidine. There are currently six known bottromycin compounds, which differ in the extent of side chain methylation, an additional characteristic of the bottromycin class. The total synthesis of bottromycin A2 was required to definitively determine the structure of the first bottromycin. Thus far, gene clusters predicted to produce bottromycins have been identified in the genus Streptomyces. Bottromycins differ from other RiPPs in that there is no N-terminal leader peptide. Rather, the precursor peptide has a C-terminal extension of 35-37 amino acids, hypothesized to act as a recognition sequence for posttranslational machinery. =Cyanobactins= Patellamide A structure with N-C cyclization highlighted in red Cyanobactins are diverse metabolites from cyanobacteria with N-to-C macrocylization of a 6‚Äì20 amino acid chain. Cyanobactins are natural products isolated from cyanobacteria, and close to 30% of all cyanobacterial strains are thought to contain cyanobacterial gene clusters. However, while thus far all cyanobactins are credited to cyanobacteria, there exists the possibility that other organisms could produce similar natural products. The precursor peptide of the cyanobactin family is traditionally designated the \\"E\\" gene, whereas precursor peptides are designated gene \\"A\\" in most RiPP gene clusters. \\"A\\" is a serine protease involved in cleavage of the leader peptide and subsequent macrocyclization of the peptide natural product, in combination with an additional serine protease homologue, the encoded by gene \\"G\\". Members of the cyanobactin family may bear thiazolines/oxazolines, thiazoles/oxazoles, and methylations depending on additional modification enzymes. For example, perhaps the most famous cyanobactin is patellamide A, which contains two thiazoles, a methyloxazoline, and an oxazoline in its final state, a macrocycle derived from 8 amino acids. =Lanthipeptides= The structure of nisin, a lanthipeptide natural product. Lan and MeLan posttranslational modifications are shown in red. Lanthipeptides are one of the most well-studied families of RiPPs. The family is characterized by the presence of lanthionine (Lan) and 3-methyllanthionine (MeLan) residues in the final natural product. There are four major classes of lanthipeptides, delineated by the enzymes responsible for installation of Lan and MeLan. The dehydratase and cyclase can be two separate proteins or one multifunctional enzyme. Previously, lanthipeptides were known as \\"lantipeptides\\" before a consensus was reached in the field. Lantibiotics are lanthipeptides that have known antimicrobial activity. The founding member of the lanthipeptide family, nisin, is a lantibiotic that has been used to prevent the growth of food-born pathogens for over 40 years. =Lasso peptides= Lasso peptides are short peptides containing an N-terminal macrolactam macrocycle \\"ring\\" through which a linear C-terminal \\"tail\\" is threaded. Because of this threaded-loop topology, these peptides resemble lassos, giving rise to their name. They are a member of a larger class of amino-acid-based lasso structures. Additionally, lasso peptides are formally rotaxanes. The N-terminal \\"ring\\" can be from 7 to 9 amino acids long and is formed by an isopeptide bond between the N-terminal amine of the first amino acid of the peptide and the carboxylate side chain of an aspartate or glutamate residue. The C-terminal \\"tail\\" ranges from 7 to 15 amino acids in length. The first amino acid of lasso peptides is almost invariably glycine or cysteine, with mutations at this site not being tolerated by known enzymes. Thus, bioinformatics-based approaches to lasso peptide discovery have thus used this as a constraint. However, some lasso peptides were recently discovered that also contain serine or alanine as their first residue. The threading of the lasso tail is trapped either by disulfide bonds between ring and tail cysteine residues (class I lasso peptides), by steric effects due to bulky residues on the tail (class II lasso peptides), or both (class III lasso peptides). The compact structure makes lasso peptides frequently resistant to proteases or thermal unfolding. =Linear azol(in)e-containing peptides= The structure of plantazolicin, a linear azoli(in)e-containing peptide natural product. Posttranslationally installed azol(in)es are shown in red. Linear azole(in)e-containing peptides (LAPs) contain thiazoles and oxazoles, or their reduced thiazoline and oxazoline forms. Thiazol(in)es are the result of cyclization of Cys residues in the precursor peptide, while (methyl)oxazol(in)es are formed from Thr and Ser. Azole and azoline formation also modifies the residue in the -1 position, or directly C-terminal to the Cys, Ser, or Thr. A dehydrogenase in the LAP gene cluster is required for oxidation of azolines to azoles. Plantazolicin is a LAP with extensive cyclization. Two sets of five heterocycles endow the natural product with structural rigidity and unusually selective antibacterial activity. Streptolysin S (SLS) is perhaps the most well-studied and most famous LAP, in part because the structure is still unknown since the discovery of SLS in 1901. Thus, while the biosynthetic gene cluster suggests SLS is a LAP, structural confirmation is lacking. =Microcins= Microcins are all RiPPs produced by Enterobacteriaceae with a molecular weight <10 kDa. Many members of other RiPP families, such as microcin B17 (LAP) and microcin J25 (Lasso peptide) are also considered microcins. Instead of being classified based on posttranslational modifications or modifying enzymes, microcins are instead identified by molecular weight, native producer, and antibacterial activity. Microcins are either plasmid- or chromosome-encoded, but specifically have activity against Enerobacteriaceae. Because these organisms are also often producers of microcins, the gene cluster contains not only a precursor peptide and modification enzymes, but also a self-immunity gene to protect the producing strain, and genes encoding export of the natural product. Microcins have bioactivity against Gram-negative bacteria but usually display narrow- spectrum activity due to hijacking of specific receptors involved in the transport of essential nutrients. =Thiopeptides= Thiostrepton RiPP Most of the characterized thiopeptides have been isolated from Actinobacteria. General structural features of thiopeptide macrocycles, are dehydrated amino acids and thiazole rings formed from dehydrated serine/threonine and cyclized cysteine residues, respectively The thiopeptide macrocycle is closed with a six- membered nitrogen-bearing ring. Oxidation state and substitution pattern of the nitrogenous ring determines the series of the thiopeptide natural product. While the mechanism of macrocyclization is not known, the nitrogenous ring can exist in thiopeptides as a piperidine, dehydropiperidine, or a fully oxidized pyridine. Additionally, some thiopeptides bear a second macrocycle, which bears a quinaldic acid or indolic acid residue derived from tryptophan. Perhaps the most well-characterized thiopeptide, thiostrepton A, contains a dehydropiperidine ring and a second, quinaldic acid-containing macrocycle. Four residues are dehydrated during posttranslational modification, and the final natural product also bears four thiazoles and one azoline. =Other RiPPs= Autoinducing Peptides (AIPs) and quorum sensing peptides are used as signaling molecules in the process called quorum sensing. AIPs are characterized by the presence of a cyclic ester or thioester, unlike other regulatory peptides that are linear. In pathogens, exported AIPs bind to extracellular receptors that trigger the production of virulence factors. In Staphylococcus aureus, AIPs are biosynthesized from a precursor peptide composed of a C-terminal leader region, the core region, and negatively charged tail region that is, along with the leader peptide, cleaved before AIP export. Bacterial Head-to-Tail Cyclized Peptides refers exclusively to ribosomally synthesized peptides with 35-70 residues and a peptide bond between the N- and C-termini, sometimes referred to as bacteriocins, although this term is used more broadly. The distinctive nature of this class is not only the relatively large size of the natural products but also the modifying enzymes responsible for macrocyclization. Other N-to-C cyclized RiPPs, such as the cyanobactins and orbitides, have specialized biosynthetic machinery for macrocylization of much smaller core peptides. Thus far, these bacteriocins have been identified only in Gram-positive bacteria. Enterocin AS-48 was isolated from Enterococcus and, like other bacteriocins, is relatively resistant to high temperature, pH changes, and many proteases as a result of macrocyclization. Based on solution structures and sequence alignments, bacteriocins appear to take on similar 3D structures despite little sequence homology, contributing to stability and resistance to degradation. Conopeptides and other toxoglossan peptides are the components of the venom of predatory marine snails, such as the cone snails or Conus. Venom peptides from cone snails are generally smaller than those found in other animal venoms (10-30 amino acids vs. 30-90 amino acids) and have more disulfide crosslinks. A single species may have 50-200 conopeptides encoded in its genome, recognizable by a well-conserved signal sequence. Cyclotides are RiPPs with a head-to-tail cyclization and three conserved disulfide bonds that form a knotted structure called a cyclic cysteine knot motif. No other posttranslational modifications have been observed on the characterized cyclotides, which are between 28 - 37 amino acids in size. Cyclotides are plant natural products and the different cyclotides appear to be species- specific. While many activities have been reported for cyclotides, it has been hypothesized that all are united by a common mechanism of binding to and disrupting the cell membrane. Glycocins are RiPPS that are glycosylated antimicrobial peptides. Only two members have been fully characterized, making this a small RiPP class. Sublancin 168 and glycocin F are both Cys- glycosylated and, in addition, have disulfide bonds between non-glycosylated Cys residues. While both members bear S-glycosyl groups, RiPPs bearing O- or N-linked carbohydrates will also be included in this family as they are discovered. Linaridins are characterized by C-terminal aminovinyl cysteine residues. While this posttranslational modification is also seen in the lanthipeptides epidermin and mersacidin, linaridins do not have Lan or MeLan residues. In addition, the linaridin moiety is formed from modification of two Cys residues, whereas lanthipeptide aminovinyl cysteines are formed from Cys and dehydroalanine (Dha). The first linaridin to be characterized was cypemycin. Microviridins are cyclic N-acetylated trideca- and tetradecapeptides with œâ-ester and/or œâ-amide bonds. Lactone formation through glutamate or aspartate œâ-carboxy groups and the lysine Œµ-amino group forms macrocycles in the final natural product. Orbitides are plant-derived N-to-C cyclized peptides with no disulfide bonds. Also referred to as Caryophyllaceae-like homomonocyclopeptides, orbitides are 5-12 amino acids in length and are composed of mainly hydrophobic residues. Similar to the amatoxins and phallotoxins, the gene sequences of orbitides suggest the presence of a C-terminal recognition sequence. In the flaxseed variety Linum usitatissimum, a precursor peptide was found using Blast searching that potentially contains five core peptides separated by putative recognition sequences. Proteusins are named after \\"Proteus\\", a Greek shape-shifting sea god. Until now, the only known members in the family of Proteusins are called polytheonamides. They were originally presumed to be nonribosomal natural products due to the presence of many D-amino acids and other non-proteinogenic amino acids. However, a metagenomic study revealed the natural products as the most extensively modified class of RiPPs known to date. Six enzymes are responsible for installing a total of 48 posttranslational modifications onto the polytheonamide A and B precursor peptides, including 18 epimerizations. Polytheonamides are exceptionally large, as a single molecule is able to span a cell membrane and form an ion channel. Sactipeptides contain intramolecular linkages between the sulfur of Cys residues and the Œ±-carbon of another residue in the peptide. A number of nonribosomal peptides bear the same modification. In 2003, the first RiPP with a sulfur-to-Œ±-carbon linkage was reported when the structure of subtilosin A was determined using isotopically enriched media and NMR spectroscopy. In the case of subtilosin A, isolated from Bacillus subtilis 168, the CŒ± crosslinks between Cys4 and Phe31, Cys7 and Thr28, and Cys13 and Phe22 are not the only posttranslational modifications; the C- and N-termini form an amide bond, resulting in a circular structure that is conformationally restricted by the CŒ± bonds. Sactipeptides with antimicrobial activity are commonly referred to as sactibiotics (sulfur to alpha-carbon antibiotic). Biosynthesis RiPPs are characterized by a common biosynthetic strategy wherein genetically-encoded peptides undergo translation and subsequent chemical modification by biosynthetic enzymes. =Common features= General scheme for RiPP biosynthesis.All RiPPs are synthesized first at the ribosome as a precursor peptide. This peptide consists of a core peptide segment which is typically preceded (and occasionally followed) by a leader peptide segment and is typically ~20-110 residues long. The leader peptide is usually important for enabling enzymatic processing of the precursor peptide via aiding in recognition of the core peptide by biosynthetic enzymes and for cellular export. Some RiPPs also contain a recognition sequence C-terminal to the core peptide; these are involved in excision and cyclization. Additionally, eukaryotic RiPPs may contain a signal segment of the precursor peptide which helps direct the peptide to cellular compartments. During RiPP biosynthesis, the unmodified precursor peptide (containing an unmodified core peptide, UCP) is recognized and chemically modified sequentially by biosynthetic enzymes (PRPS). Examples of modifications include dehydration (i.e. lanthipeptides, thiopeptides), cyclodehydration (i.e. thiopeptides), prenylation (i.e. cyanobactins), and cyclization (i.e. lasso peptides), among others. The resulting modified precursor peptide (containing a modified core peptide, MCP) then undergoes proteolysis, wherein the non-core regions of the precursor peptide are removed. This results in the mature RiPP. Nomenclature Papers published prior to a recent community consensus employ differing sets of nomenclature. The precursor peptide has been referred to previously as prepeptide, prepropeptide, or structural peptide. The leader peptide has been referred to as a propeptide, pro-region, or intervening region. Historical alternate terms for core peptide included propeptide, structural peptide, and toxin region (for conopeptides, specifically). =Family-specific features= (A) Steps in the installation of lanthionine and 3-methyllanthionine bridges in lanthipeptide biosynthesis (B) Classes of lanthipeptide biosynthetic enzymes Lanthipeptides Lanthipeptides are characterized by the presence lanthionine (Lan) and 3-methyllanthionine (MeLan) residues. Lan residues are formed from a thioether bridge between Cys and Ser, while MeLan residues are formed from the linkage of Cys to a Thr residue. The biosynthetic enzymes responsible for Lan and MeLan installation first dehydrate Ser and Thr to dehydroalanine (Dha) and dehydrobutyrine (Dhb), respectively. Subsequent thioether crosslinking occurs through a Michael-type addition by Cys onto Dha or Dhb. Four classes of lanthipeptide biosynthetic enzymes have been designated. Class I lanthipeptides have dedicated lanthipeptide dehydratases, called LanB enzymes, though more specific designations are used for particular lanthipeptides (e.g. NisB is the nisin dehydratase). A separate cyclase, LanC, is responsible for the second step in Lan and MeLan biosynthesis. However, class II, III, and IV lanthipeptides have bifunctional lanthionine synthetases in their gene clusters, meaning a single enzyme carries out both dehydration and cyclization steps. Class II synthetases, designated LanM synthetases, have N-terminal dehydration domains with no sequence homology to other lanthipeptide biosynthetic enzymes; the cyclase domain has homology to LanC. Class III (LanKC) and IV (LanL) enzymes have similar N-terminal lyase and central kinase domains, but diverge in C-terminal cyclization domains: the LanL cyclase domain is homologous to LanC, but the class III enzymes lack Zn- ligand binding domains. Linear azol(in)e-containing peptides Schematic representation of azol(in)e biosynthesis in ribosomal natural products. The hallmark of linear azol(in)e-containing peptide (LAP) biosynthesis is the formation of azol(in)e heterocycles from the nucleophilic amino acids serine, threonine, or cysteine. This is accomplished by three enzymes referred to as the B, C, and D proteins; the precursor peptide is referred to as the A protein, as in other classes. The C protein is mainly involved in leader peptide recognition and binding and is sometimes called a scaffolding protein. The D protein is an ATP-dependent cyclodehydratase that catalyzes the cyclodehydration reaction, resulting in formation of an azoline ring. This occurs by direct activation of the amide backbone carbonyl with ATP, resulting in stoichiometric ATP consumption. The C and D proteins are occasionally present as a single, fused protein, as is the case for trunkamide biosynthesis. The B protein is a flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-dependent dehydrogenase which oxidizes certain azoline rings into azoles. The B protein is typically referred to as the dehydrogenase; the C and D proteins together form the cyclodehydratase, although the D protein alone performs the cyclodehydration reaction. Early work on microcin B17 adopted a different nomenclature for these proteins, but a recent consensus has been adopted by the field as described above. Cyanobactins Cyanobactin biosynthesis requires proteolytic cleavage of both N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the precursor peptide. The defining proteins are thus an N-terminal protease, referred to as the A protein, and a C-terminal protease, referred to as the G protein. The G protein is also responsible for macrocyclization. For cyanobactins, the precursor peptide is referred to as the E peptide. Minimally, the E peptide requires a leader peptide region, a core (structural) region, and both N-terminal and C-terminal protease recognition sequences. In contrast to most RiPPs, for which a single precursor peptide encodes a single natural product via a lone core peptide, cyanobactin E peptides can contain multiple core regions; multiple E peptides can even be present in a single gene cluster. Many cyanobactins also undergo heterocyclization by a heterocyclase (referred to as the D protein), installing oxazoline or thiazoline moieties from Ser/Thr/Cys residues prior to the action of the A and G proteases. The heterocyclase is an ATP-dependent YcaO homologue that behaves biochemically in the same manner as YcaO-domain cyclodehydratases in thiopeptide and linear azol(in)e-containing peptide (LAP) biosynthesis (described above). A common modification is prenylation of hydroxyl groups by an F protein prenyltransferase. Oxidation of azoline heterocycles to azoles can also be accomplished by an oxidase domain located on the G protein. Unusual for ribosomal peptides, cyanobactins can include D-amino acids; these can occur adjacent to azole or azoline residues. The functions of some proteins found commonly in cyanobactin biosynthetic gene clusters, the B and C proteins, are unknown. Thiopeptides Thiopeptide biosynthesis involves particularly extensive modification of the core peptide scaffold. Indeed, due to the highly complex structures of thiopeptides, it was commonly thought that these natural products were nonribosomal peptides. Recognition of the ribosomal origin of these molecules came in 2009 with the independent discovery of the gene clusters for several thiopeptides. The standard nomenclature for thiopeptide biosynthetic proteins follows that of the thiomuracin gene cluster. In addition to the precursor peptide, referred to as the A peptide, thiopeptide biosynthesis requires at least six genes. These include lanthipeptide-like dehydratases, designated the B and C proteins, which install dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine moieties by dehydrating Ser/Thr precursor residues. Azole and azoline synthesis is effected by the E protein, the dehydrogenase, and the G protein, the cyclodehydratase. The nitrogen-containing heterocycle is installed by the D protein cyclase via a putative [4+2] cycloaddition of dehydroalanine moieties to form the characteristic macrocycle. The F protein is responsible for binding of the leader peptide. Thiopeptide biosynthesis is biochemically similar to that of cyanobactins, lanthipeptides, and linear azol(in)e-containing peptides (LAPs). As with cyanobactins and LAPs, azole and azoline synthesis occurs via the action of an ATP-dependent YcaO-domain cyclodehydratase. In contrast to LAPs, where cyclodehydration occurs via the action of two distinct proteins responsible for leader peptide binding and cyclodehydrative catalysis, these are fused into a single protein (G protein) in cyanobactin and thiopeptide biosynthesis. However, in thiopeptides, an additional protein, designated the Ocin-ThiF-like protein (F protein) is necessary for leader peptide recognition and potentially recruiting other biosynthetic enzymes. Lasso peptides (A) Representative examples of lasso peptide biosynthetic gene clusters. Arrows depicting open reading frames are shown with lengths proportional to gene size, as indicated by the scale bar. Genes are color coded and labeled according to function. (B) General scheme of lasso peptide biosynthesis.Lasso peptide biosynthesis requires at least three genes, referred to as the A, B, and C proteins. The A gene encodes the precursor peptide, which is modified by the B and C proteins into the mature natural product. The B protein is an adenosine triphosphate-dependent cysteine protease that cleaves the leader region from the precursor peptide. The C protein displays homology to asparagine synthetase and is thought to activate the carboxylic acid side chain of a glutamate or aspartate residue via adenylylation. The N-terminal amine formed by the B protein (protease) then reacts with this activated side chain to form the macrocycle-forming isopeptide bond. The exact steps and reaction intermediates in lasso peptide biosynthesis remain unknown due to experimental difficulties associated with the proteins. Commonly, the B protein is referred to as the lasso protease, and the C protein is referred to as the lasso cyclase. Some lasso peptide biosynthetic gene clusters also require an additional protein of unknown function for biosynthesis. Additionally, lasso peptide gene clusters usually include an ABC transporter (D protein) or an isopeptidase, although these are not strictly required for lasso peptide biosynthesis and are sometimes absent. No X-ray crystal structure is yet known for any lasso peptide biosynthetic protein. The biosynthesis of lasso peptides is particularly interesting due to the inaccessibility of the threaded-lasso topology to chemical peptide synthesis.

Established 1985 as the Smiths Falls Railway Museum, the RMEO works to preserve the 1913 Canadian Northern (CNoR) station and a collection of historic rolling stock, equipment and railway memorabilia. History The Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR, 1899‚Äì1923) struggled to build a third transcontinental railway from Qu√©bec City to Vancouver but ultimately met with financial ruin. Its assets were acquired by Canadian National Railway, which gradually abandoned much of the network as unprofitable or duplicative of its existing lines. Westward from Ottawa, CNoR operated a line through Pembroke and Algonquin Park (now removed) and a line through Smiths Falls which incorporated the CNoR-owned Bay of Quinte Railway from Sydenham to Napanee. The lines split just west of the Canadian Northern Ontario Railway Federal Bridge across the Rideau River. While a portion of CNoR line between Smiths Falls and Ottawa remains in Via Rail passenger service, the line beyond Smiths Falls was embargoed in 1979 and abandoned, along with the local station. (The CPR operated its own, separate Smiths Falls railway station, a divisional point on CP's Montr√©al-Toronto mainline; VIA used that station until 2010. CP also owned the former Brockville and Ottawa Railway line from Brockville through Smiths Falls to Sand Point, near Arnprior; this created a crossroads of two railways with tracks leading in six directions from Smiths Falls.) Efforts to save the station date to 1981, a time in which the building was in \\"a state of disrepair and abandonment\\" after fifteen years boarded up at trackside.Old railway station eyed as museum, Ottawa Citizen, Nov 12, 1981 By 1982, the station was at risk of CN demolition;Valley groups fight to keep rail stations from going the way of the steam train, Ottawa Citizen, Dec 10, 1984 locally opposed demolitions of historic stations in other towns in-region (such as Pembroke) had demonstrated federally regulated railways to be beyond the reach of provincial and local historic preservation laws.

He exhibited regularly at the Salon de l‚ÄôUnion des Artistes in Provence from 1919 to 1948. He also exhibited his work at the 1922 √âxposition Coloniale and the 1935 √âxposition catholique, both held in Marseille. His work in Marseille and his contribution to helping to make Marseiile an artistic centre resulted in him being elected to the Acad√©mie de Marseille on 4 May 1950. Main works 1\\\\. Imbert medallion. Gondard executed a medallion celebrating the life of Leon Imbert. 2\\\\. The La Fare-les-Oliviers war memorial. This memorial was erected in 1920 and covers the dead of the 1870, 1914-1918 and 1939-1945 wars and the conflicts in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. On the west face of the memorial is Gondard's statue of a veiled woman who holds a broad sword and on the north and south faces are verses in the language of Provence by Victorin Lavison dedicated to those lost in the 1914-1918 war. 3\\\\.

Central to the memorial is Gondard's sculpture of a standing Gallic warrior, naked and muscular, whose arms are crossed over the hilt of a large broadsword. Gondard received the commission in 1924. At the foot of the warrior are inscribed the words in Latin \\"PAX GALLIAE\\". A total of 210 men are listed. 6\\\\. Le Voix de la Mer.

It is Pintoff's first feature film, having previously only made shorts The Film follows the story of a fireman named Harvey Middleman who lives a humble life; he loves his kids, he loves his wife, and he really loves his job. One night Harvey saves a young model from a burning building and it's love at first sight. Harvey then struggles to determine what he should do. Comedy ensues as Harvey often breaks the fourth wall and the film does not take itself seriously at all. Plot Harvey Middleman (Eugene Troobnick), a New York City fireman, lives happily in a New Jersey suburb with his wife (Arlene Golonka) and two small children. Harvey loves his life but after a fight with her over dinner one night he imagines himself rescuing a beautiful young girl from a fire. Just as he dreamt it he rescues a young model named Lois (Patricia Harty). Harvey steals a kiss from her as he resuscitates her and the two quickly fall in love. After secretly dating her several times, Harvey decides he must solve his moral dilemma by consulting his psychiatrist Mrs. Koogleman (Hermione Gingold). Mrs. Koogleman however is too preoccupied with her own relationship problems to help Harvey with his conundrum. Another fire breaks out in Lois's apartment, and this time one of Harvey's associates Dinny (Will Mackenzie) rescues Lois while Harvey saves a cat. Lois and Dinny quickly fall in love and Harvey is left to return to his wife. Cast * Eugene Troobnick as Harvey Middleman: A simple fireman who loves his job.

Sir Edmund Frederick Du Cane (23 March 1830 ‚Äì 7 June 1903) was an English major-general of the Royal Engineers and prison administrator. Early life Born at Colchester, Essex on 23 March 1830, he was youngest child in a family of four sons and two daughters of Major Richard Du Cane (1788‚Äì1832), 20th Light Dragoons; his mother was Eliza, daughter of Thomas Ware of Woodfort, Mallow, County Cork. After Dedham grammar school to 1843, and a private coaching establishment at Wimbledon (1843‚Äì46), he entered the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich in November 1846. He passed out at the head of his batch at the end of 1848, having taken first place in mathematics and fortification. Du Cane received a commission as second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 19 December 1848. He joined at Chatham, and in December 1850 was posted to a company of royal sappers and miners commanded by Captain Henry Charles Cunliffe-Owen at Woolwich. He was assistant superintendent of the foreign side of the International Exhibition of 1851, and assistant secretary to the juries of awards. In Australia From 1851 to 1856 Du Cane was employed in organising convict labour on public works in the colony of Swan River, in Western Australia, which was then first devoted to penal purposes under the command of Captain Edmund Henderson. Promoted first lieutenant on 17 February 1854, he was stationed at Guildford in charge of the works in the eastern district of the colony. He was made a magistrate of the colony and a visiting magistrate of convict stations. Return to the United Kingdom Recalled early in 1856 by the Crimean War, Du Cane arrived home on 21 June to find the war over, and joined for duty at the war office, under the inspector- general of fortification, in August 1856. He was employed on designs and estimates for the new defences proposed for the dockyards and naval bases of the United Kingdom. Promoted second captain on 16 April 1858, he during the next five years designed most of the new land works at Dover, and the chain of land forts at Plymouth extending for five miles from Staddon Fort, in the east, across the River Plym, by Laira, to Ernesettle on the River Tamar. Prison administration In 1863, on the recommendation of Henderson who had become chairman of the board of directors of convict prisons, Du Cane was appointed director of convict prisons, as well as an inspector of military prisons. He administered the system of penal servitude as it was reformed by the Prison Act 1865, and made the arrangements for additional prison accommodation after the abolition of penal transportation in 1867. In 1869 Du Cane succeeded Henderson as chairman of the board of directors of convict prisons, surveyor-general of prisons, and inspector-general of military prisons. On 5 February 1864 he was promoted first captain in his corps; on 5 July 1872 major; on 11 December 1873 lieutenant-colonel; and four years later brevet-colonel. He was placed on the supernumerary list in August 1877. The charge of the colonial convict prisons was transferred to Du Cane in 1869. An advocate of using prison labour for works of national utility, (on which he read a paper before the Society of Arts in 1871) Du Cane provided for the carrying out by convicts of the breakwater and works of defence at Portland, the docks at Portsmouth and Chatham, and additional prison accommodation. At the International Prison Congress in London in 1872 Du Cane described the British system of penal servitude. Du Cane's main success as prison administrator was the reorganisation of county and borough prisons, which had previously been managed by some 2000 local justices, and largely maintained by local funds. Du Cane in 1873 submitted to the secretary of state a comprehensive scheme for the transfer to the government of all local prisons and the whole cost of their maintenance. The reform was formalised by the Prison Act 1877, when Du Cane, who had been made C.B., civil division, on 27 March 1873, was promoted K.C.B., civil division, and became chairman of the three prison commissioners, under the new act to reorganise and administer the county and borough prisons. On 1 April 1878 these prisons came under government control. Their number was soon reduced by one-half, the rules made uniform, the progressive system of discipline adopted, the staff co-ordinated into a single service with a regular system of promotion, structural and other improvements introduced, and the cost of maintenance largely reduced. Employment of prisoners was developed and the discharged prisoner was helped to earn a living. Criminology Du Cane also inaugurated a registration of criminals. In 1877 he produced the first \\"Black Book\\" list, printed by convict labour, of over 12,000 habitual criminals with their aliases and descriptions. A register followed of criminals having distinctive marks on their bodies. Du Cane's suggestion to Sir Francis Galton that types of feature in different kinds of criminality were worth a scientific study prompted Galton to attempt composite portraiture. Du Cane also encouraged the use of Galton's finger- print system in the identification of criminals. Last years Du Cane retired from the army with the honorary rank of major-general on 31 December 1887, and from the civil service on 23 March 1895. A set of his sketches of Peninsular War battlefields was exhibited at the Royal Military Exhibition at Chelsea in 1890. Du Cane died at his residence, 10 Portman Square, London, on 7 June 1903, and was buried in Great Braxted churchyard, Essex. Memorial street One of the prisons he designed was Wormwood Scrubs, and the street in which it is located is named Du Cane Road after him. Works In 1885 Du Cane published in Macmillan's \\"Citizen\\" series The Punishment and Prevention of Crime, a historical sketch of British prisons and the treatment of crime. He contributed to periodicals, mainly on penology, and frequently wrote to The Times on military and other subjects. To the Royal Engineers Journal he sent memoirs of several of his brother officers. Family Du Cane was twice married: # At St. John's Church, Fremantle, Western Australia, on 18 July 1855, to Mary Dorothea, daughter of Lieut.-colonel John Molloy, a Peninsula and Waterloo veteran of the Rifle Brigade, of Fairlawn, Busselton, Western Australia; she died on 13 May 1881. # At St. Margaret's, Westminster, on 2 January 1883, to Florence Victoria, widow of Colonel M. J. Grimston, of Grimston Garth and Kilnwick, Yorkshire, and daughter of Colonel Hardress Robert Saunderson. By his first wife he had a family of three sons and five daughters.

(\\"Billy\\") McClain (12 October 1866 ‚Äì 19 January 1950) was an African-American acrobat, comedian and actor who starred in minstrel shows before World War I. He wrote, produced and directed several major stage and outdoor extravaganzas, and wrote a number of popular songs. He was influential in extending the range of minstrel shows far beyond the traditional conventions of the time, giving them appeal to much wider audiences. He toured in the USA, Canada, Australia and Europe. Later he promoted boxing and played several minor roles in movies. Life =Early years= William C. McClain was born on Elm Street in Indianapolis, Indiana, on 12 October 1866. He played cornet in Bell's Band when he was a boy, appearing in public for the first time in 1881 at Crone's Garden. In 1883 he joined Lew Johnson's Minstrels, then moved to Heck and Sawyer's Minstrels and then Blythe's Georgia Minstrels. McClain joined Sells Brothers' and Forepaugh's Circus in 1886 for a tour of the Hawaiian islands. He was the first black player with the circus. In 1887 he was with the Gigantic Comedy company. McClain recalled playing with Cleveland's Minstrels at the Gaiety Theater in Kansas City in 1887. In that show he and Tom Brown were the first to do a sketch of a Chinaman and a \\"coon\\". He played with Cleveland's Minstrels in 1890, and toured with this company in the USA and Canada in 1891. On 10 January 1891 McClain was performing with Cleveland's Colored Minstrels in San Francisco when he fell from his trapeze and had three teeth knocked out. In 1892 McClain trained as a boxer. 1895 poster for the Gigantic Exhibition of Negro Life and Character in Brooklyn Early in the 1890s McClain and his wife Cordelia joined the Hyers Sisters Company. In 1892 the couple joined the extravaganza South Before the War, in which McClain was stage manager and the leading black comedian. The show was exceptional for the time in being mixed-race. McClain claimed to be the first to put a cake walk on the stage, in South before the War. Around then McClain was star of Suwanee River, an otherwise all-white show. In the summer of 1893 McClain directed the black performers in a spectacular reenactment of the American Civil War Siege of Vicksburg, which was staged outdoors on Manhattan Beach in Coney Island. In 1894 the McClains joined On the Mississippi, a Southern comic melodrama produced by Davis and Keough. =Producer and manager= Billy McClain in 1895, from The New York Times review of Black America McClain was hired in 1895 by Nate Salsbury to produce a show called Black America. Salsbury presented the show as educational, to help people understand the colored man. Promotional material said the \\"Scenes of rural simplicity\\" portrayed the \\"lovable, bright side of the true southern negro.\\" The show was put on outdoors in Brooklyn, Boston, Manhattan, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.. There was a cast of 500 black people. It included replicas of cabins in a plantation village, music that included a huge choir of 300, dancing and novelty acts. The Ninth Cavalry Band of the US Army, which consisted of black musicians, played in Black America. In the finale of the show, the mass choir sang several tunes to giant portraits of white Union patriots such as John Brown, William Tecumseh Sherman, Ulysses S. Grant and Abraham Lincoln, and of the black patriot Frederick Douglass. Although billed only as music director, McClain probably created and directed the show, which carries forward elements of much of his earlier work, particularly his script Before and After the War. McClain claimed credit, and his contemporary Tom Fletcher gave him credit. His wife, Cordelia, performed as a soloist. Cordelia McClain had trained as an actress under Billy McClain in Indianapolis. Later she became a stage manager and producer. In a 2 June 1895 report on the Brooklyn show titled \\"Fun for the Darkies\\" The New York Times identified Billy and Cordelia McClain as the aristocracy of Ambrose Park. Billy McClain was simply called the leader of the choruses. The show, presenting \\"Real Blacks from the Southern Plantations\\", was perhaps commercial and vulgar but showed the potential for upward mobility of African Americans. Billy McClain starred in A.G. Field's Darkest America, and led the company in a tour of regular theatrical circuits. The show included songs, dances and sketches, and depicted African American life from the plantation up to modern times. A review in the 11 November 1896 Colored American of Washington D.C. praised the show, full of \\"clean, bright and wholesome fun\\". Another reviewer said the \\"delineation of Negro life, carrying the race through all their historical phases from the plantation, into the reconstruction days and finally painting our people as they are today, cultured and accomplished in social graces, holds the mirror faithfully up to nature.\\" Billy and Cordelia McClain also performed in Sam T. Jack's The Creole Show, less a traditional minstrel show than a vaudeville revue. Orpheus McAdoo's Georgia Minstrels in Australia in January 1900 In 1899 McClain and his wife Cordelia joined M.B. Curtis's All-star American Minstrels on an Australian tour. Ernest Hogan, another singer-dancer-comedian, also appeared in this show. The company sailed for Sydney on 1 June 1899. Curtis abandoned the show soon after it arrived, and Hogan took over. The McClains transferred to Orpheus McAdoo's Georgia Minstrels, and stayed on in Australia after this company went back to the USA. In January 1900 McClain was playing in the Opera House, Brisbane, Australia, with the O.M. McAdoo Georgia Minstrels. A reviewer said \\"The two low comedians of the company‚àí\\"Billy\\" McClain and C.W. Walker‚àíhad their hearers in fits of laughter throughout the evening, their reappearance on the stage after their turns in the first part being always the signal for fresh outbursts of mirth. Before the interval ballads were well rendered by Madame Cordelia... While in Australia McClain acted as manager for the Australian black boxing contender Peter Felix. After returning to the USA McClain appeared in Gus Hill's Smart Set company, which starred performers such as Ernest Hogan, Tom McIntosh and Sherman H. Dudley. The troupe staged vaudeville-style shows with comedy sketches, songs, dances and specialty acts. McCain and Hogan put together the original show. McCain contributed to a Smart Set musical comedy called Southern Enchantment. A review of a performance at the Empire Theatre in Newark, New Jersey on 13 October 1902 said, \\"The advent of a new darky sensation, the like of which our eyes have never seen before, greets the world. The Smart Set is the smartest set of colored people ever put together, on one stage in America...\\" A March 1903 review said \\"In many respects the show was a notable departure from the exhibitions of the past, in that it sought to put a better front to Negro life.\\" In September 1903 the Smart Set opened its second season in Boston. McCain was stage manager but Tom McIntosh replaced Hogan as George Washington Bullion. On 14 May 1904 the Indianapolis Freeman reproduced a review published by the St. Louis Star which said, In 1904 J. Edward Green succeeded McClain as stage manager and producer of the Smart Set. Gus Hill's Smart Set put on the touring show The Black Politician, a musical comedy, in 1904-08. Music and lyrics were by James Reese Europe and Cecil Mack. It starred Jim Burris, Tom Logan and Irvin Allen. Billy McClain wrote and performed in the play. =Later career= McClain lived in Paris, France from 1906 to 1913. He played in London and Paris in 1906 with Fred Karno's comedy troupe. They put on a popular show at the Casino de Paris and then moved to the Folies Berg√®re. His wife also performed with the troupe, as did an unknown comedian named Charlie Chaplin. While in France McClain drove a 40 hp De Dion-Bouton from Paris to Monte Carlo in a record time for touring cars. Writing from Paris in April 1910, McClain said he was the first Negro to produce, play, sing, dance and talk in French. In 1911 McClain was based in Brussels, Belgium, running a boxing school. McClain managed and trained the heavyweight boxer Sam McVey. In 1931 McClain moved to Los Angeles and obtained a position with the Pasadena police department as a physical trainer. In August 1931 he appeared on stage for the first time in 21 years in a benefit performance, playing the two leading roles from Uncle Tom - Uncle Tom himself and the slave owner Simon Legree. While working for the police department he acted in several films. These included Nagana (1933), starring Melvyn Douglas, the short Rhapsody in Black, where he sang four \\"southern melodies\\", and Dimples, starring Shirley Temple. Between 1933 and 1946 McClain appeared in many other film roles, although often these were minor parts and he was not credited. He played a servant, butler, footman, cook and janitor. His last role was as \\"Uncle Ben\\" in Vincente Minnelli's suspense drama Undercurrent (1946). His name was misspelled in the end credits as \\"McLain.\\" Billy McClain died on 19 January 1950 when the trailer he was sleeping in caught fire. McClain was one of the pioneers in introducing \\"vaudevillized minstrelsy\\", which opened a wider range of styles on the eve of the ragtime era. Despite his great ability, he was handicapped by prejudice against African Americans.

Suzanne Jenniches (born 1949) is an American engineer who served from April 2, 2003, to 2010 as the vice president and general manager of Government Systems Division of Northrop Grumman Corp.'s Electronic Systems sector. She holds a patent for laser soldering. She was the only woman to take engineering evening classes at Johns Hopkins University in the 1970s. She was among the first women to do so at that University. She was both the first female engineer and, therefore, the first intern at Westinghouse Electric Company. She is one of the first female leaders at Northrop Grumman, and considered a pioneer by the Society of Women Engineers. Early life The firstborn of one son and two daughters, Jenniches is the first in her family to have a college degree. Her parents both graduated from high school and owned their own business. Running a business required long, 12- to 14-hour work days. Jenniches learned the value of work ethic through her parents. Jenniches's parents also taught her personal responsibility. They told her that if there was a problem at school, then she must have contributed to it- Every Christmas, Jenniches' father, a mechanic with a service station garage and correspondence trade school student, gave her a power tool as a present. When she moved on to college, she brought the tools with her: sanders, circular saws, miter boxes, drills, and other equipment. Atypical for women at the time, it was Jenniches, not her husband, who supplied mechanical tools for the household. In high school, Jenniches's guidance counselor encouraged her to go to college. Therefore, when Clarion recruiters visited her school, Jenniches accepted their invitation and applied to one school. She received a full scholarship. In hindsight, even though her engineering career ultimately succeeded, she regretted the early aimlessness and lack of planning. Education In 1970, Jenniches earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from Clarion State College (now, Clarion University of Pennsylvania). Engineering was not an option. She believed there were only two choices open to her as a young female biology major: a nurse or a teacher. She became a biology teacher. While working as a teacher, Jenniches began to work toward an engineering degree. She attended evening school at Johns Hopkins, four nights a week, for seven years. She was the only woman at the evening engineering school for a number of years. In 1979, Jenniches earned a master's degree in environmental engineering from Johns Hopkins University. Jenniches completed extensive post-graduate work in international affairs at The Catholic University of America. She has also attended the Harvard Business School Program for Management Development. Career Jenniches began her career in science as a high school biology teacher, teaching ecology, in Westminster, Maryland. During this time, she received a magazine in the mail from the National Education Association. It was 1970, the first year of Earth Day. On the back cover, she found an ad from Johns Hopkins University. There was a post card to fill, tear out, and send in. Once again, she decided to change her career path on a whim. She applied to go to graduate school at Johns Hopkins by impulse. One of the items on the back cover flyer was the environmental engineering. At Johns Hopkins's evening school, Jenniches's peers influenced her to work at Westinghouse Electric Company. It was the first time Westinghouse attained a female engineer, so they had to create an unusual exception for her: an internship. She would be the only woman there, and the only person that had ever had an internship. Jenniches accepted the unique opportunity. She quit teaching and worked at Westinghouse as an associate engineer. She worked there, as an intern and a woman, for two weeks, unpaid, in a plant, with no security clearance, all while still attending evening classes to complete her engineering degree. No one had ever done that before. As a part of her job, she used keypunch digital tapes to program read- only memories, a PROM programmer. She worked harder than most people. Therefore, she would often be on-call, sometimes waking from home at 3 o'clock in the morning to attend to emergency data requirements. In the beginning of her engineer career, Jenniches changed jobs every eighteen months for two years. She kept the same telephone number and used it to advance her career within the company. She worked in computer test engineering, electronic assembly, advanced robotic manufacturing, radar systems, and defense programs. She engineered for Northrop Grumman (previously known as Westinghouse), and stayed at that corporation for more than thirty years. In 1980, she obtained a patent for laser soldering. In 1981 she led operations for the B-1B bomber offensive radar. She oversaw the production of the first electronically scanned antenna for production aircraft in the world. Jenniches has served in many leadership positions at Northrop Grumman Corp: In 1986, she was appointed manager of Systems & Technology Operations. Later she became Vice President of Automation and Information Systems, Vice President of Communications Systems (Electronic Systems sector). In 2003, she became the Vice President of the Government Systems Division. Societies From 1988 to 1989, Jenniches was the president of the Society of Women Engineers. From 1996 to 2003, she served on the Board of Directors for MICROS, Inc. From 1999 to 2006, She served as a Member as a United States Army Science Board. She has also served on the American Association of Engineering Societies Board of Governors and as an expert witness before Congress on numerous occasions. She advocated on behalf of engineering for NASA, NIST, AAES, and SWE. Awards Jenniches earned the Distinguished New Engineer Award in 1983 and the Achievement Award in 2000. Jenniches has received numerous awards.

The company is part of Transmashholding.  History of the factory  Bilevel rail car Russian, 1905 Monument SVL at the rail-car factory in Tver depicting a Turbojet train passenger car, Passenger trains Moscow - Nizhny Novgorod Tver Carriage Works was founded on 25 August 1898 with the name Upper Volga Railway Materials Plant. It was built at the initiative of the Franco-Belgian joint stock company Dyle et Bacalan in 1898. Initially the plant manufactured four-axle sleeping coaches for the international train company Express, passenger coaches of 4 classes, business cars with study lounges and sleeping compartments, and passenger coaches for hot-climate countries. The plant produced freight cars, platforms and refrigerator vans of different systems, tank cars, and latticed cars for peat transportation. It fulfilled the orders for production of tram cars, components, and spare parts for tram cars. Tver Carriage Works also manufactured military transports, guns, spare parts for agricultural equipment, and vehicles. Beginning in 1904 the plant manufactured double-decker passenger coaches for migrants to the Far East, and produced six-axle diner-lounges with a length of 26 m for the Grand- Ducal family. During the period of nationalization, Tver Carriage Works produced passenger coaches, freight cars, tank cars, bogies, and two-wheeled carts for the Military Technical Department and different agricultural tools. In 1926 the plant started the production of 4-axle freight cars, platforms and third-class long-distance cars. During the years of industrialization, 20-ton freight cars, flat cars, 20.2-meter third-class passenger coaches and postal- baggage cars were the main types of Tver Carriage Works‚Äôs products. At the same time Tver Carriage Works manufactured cars for the Red Army, trailer vans to tractor drivers, and trailers' workshops. The plant was severely damaged during the occupation of the city in 1941 by the Wehrmacht. After the liberation, reconstruction began. At the same time Tver Carriage Works began to produce artillery shells, mortars, bombs, mobile workshops, and medical railway cars for the Army. In October 1943, by the decision of the State Defense Committee, the enterprise was included into the number of major defense enterprises of the country. The plant produced 18 designations of military products. It also operated a tank-repair workshop. In 1944 the partially restored plant started the production of dumping cars, 4-axle platforms with a cargo capacity of 60 t, metal low-sided cars with a cargo capacity of 50 t, and, in 1948, four-axle covered freight cars with a cargo capacity of 50 t. Since 1951 Tver Carriage Works has focused on the production of passenger coaches. In 1955 it became the first enterprise in the country to produce wheel sets with axle equipment on roller bearings. In the 1960s, for the first time in the practice of the national railway engineering, wholesale production was set up at Tver Carriage Works and a large batch of coaches with air-conditioning systems and centralized electric power generated by electric power plant cars was manufactured for operation in the Central Asia and between Moscow and Leningrad. * From 1959 till 1969 - head and trailer electric cars. * From 1960 till 1966 - serial production of cars for interregional communication. * From 1961 till 1970 - power cars were made. * In 1970 - coaches for deluxe trains \\"Ulyanovsk\\", Russia. * In 1965 - express train \\"Aurora\\" with a maximum speed of 160‚Äì180 km/h. * In 1970 - track-testing car with a jet propulsion for cars testing at the speeds of up to 300 km/h. * In 1971 - first serial production of two-level platforms for light motor vehicles transportation. * In 1972 - 1973 - SVL express train \\"Russian Troika\\" with a maximum speed of 200 km/h. A new stage in the history of the plant began in 1993. A multidivisional structure was established at Tver Carriage Works on the basis of the Kalinin railcar industrial association, in accordance with the President Decree ‚Ññ 721 \\"On Organizational Measures for Transformation of the State-Owned Enterprises and Voluntary associations of the State Enterprises into Joint Stock Companies\\" dated July 1, 1992. Throughout the years Tver Carriage Works has continued to provide the country's car-building industry with bogies, wheel-sets, brake products, forgings and stampings, and cast-iron casting. Passenger-coach bogies provide extra-soft rides at speeds up to 160 km/h, while brand-new bogies with disk magnetic rail brakes provide operations of cars at speeds up of 200 km/h and were created in 1996.

The building of the muraglioni (massive walls) has erased its existence and function, just keeping a trace in the toponymy (the stretch of Lungotevere, that flanks San Michele a Ripa Grande, is called Porto di Ripa Grande, while Via del Porto is the narrow street that links the Tiber to Santa Cecilia in Trastevere and Santa Maria dell'Orto) and in the two ramps giving access to the quay of the river.  The port  During the Roman era, the maritime harbour of Rome was Ostia. From there, the wares destined to the town were transported up the Tiber, along which several docks, with specific functions, were placed. The general river emporium rose on the left bank of the river, starting from the present Rione Testaccio - where remains of the Porticus Aemilia and of the emporium are still visible - up to the slopes of the Aventine Hill, that for this reason was intensely populated during the Imperial era. The port area never completely stopped its activity even in the last years of the Empire and during the Middle Ages, serving as a landing place both for pilgrims and wares. It therefore went on housing both structures for craftmanship (carpentry, boathouse, service buildings and so on) and military structures for the control of river traffic and fiscal collection. The river port of Ripa Grande, that was the main dock on the Tiber, though much less monumental than the Port of Ripetta, was rebuilt in the 17th century opposite to the former Emporium, on the other bank of the Tiber and just a few upstream than the previous location, within Porta Portuense (that had been withdrawn as well).  The arsenal  Factories for the building of military ships had existed around the Port of Ripa Grande until the 16th century, due to the wars against the Ottoman empire. After the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, harbour activities acquired a more commercial character (i.e. ships maintenance and equipment, customs activities and alike). Just outside Porta Portese, Pope Clement XI built the new papal arsenal, intended for the maintenance of the river boats, as well as the commercial papal ships. Its position just outside the excise city wall can be explained with the purpose to reduce the fiscal pressure on the materials used in maintenance activities. The building, whose architect is unknown, was conceived as analogous to the arsenal of Civitavecchia, designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini and completed by Domenico Fontana fifty years before; it was erected between 1714 and 1715, on a smaller scale than the former one, due to its more limited functions. The structure went on working until the end of the 19th centuryAmong other things, the arsenal was used in 1798 as a warehouse for the works of art stolen by Napoleon, before they were shipped to France. when, after the building of the muraglioni (massive walls), all river- connected activities were given up. The two ramps, going down to the river under the complex of San Michele, became the only memory of the port. Arsenal activities were connected to a network of services, like customs offices and barracks, as well of handicraft specialized productions (ropes, carpentry etc.), whose only present trace is the name of a trattoria close to the gate.

The perfectly intact torc is outstanding for its high level of craftsmanship and superb artistry. Soon after its discovery this elaborate collar was acquired by the British Museum. Discovery The torc was accidentally found in 1950 by a farmer ploughing a field at Ken Hill near the village of Snettisham. It had been buried with a bracelet and coin, which helped to date the torc to around 75 BC. Many other Iron Age hoards have since been found in the vicinity, but the Great Torc is considered by archaeologists to be the most important find from Snettisham. Declared treasure trove soon after its discovery, the torc was purchased by the British Museum with the support of the National Art Collections Fund. Description The Great Torc from Snettisham, which weighs just over a kilogram, is mostly made of gold alloyed with a small part of silver. The torc was made in two ways: complex threads of metal were grouped into ropes and twisted around each other to create the crescent shaped necklace; the ends of the torc were cast in moulds with La T√®ne designs and welded onto the metal ropes to create the whole composition. Given the large amount of precious metals found at the site, in addition to the sophisticated design of luxurious jewellery such as this, it has been conjectured that the area around Snettisham may have been connected with royalty from the Iceni tribe, that was based in this part of England at the time.

It is perhaps best known for its use of \\"artificial life technology\\" to control the main character, only giving the player indirect control of the creature by manipulating the environment. Because of this, Galapagos has been called the first commercial video game to use artificial life methodology, though it was beaten to the market by Creatures, whose development cycle overlapped with that of Galapagos. Gameplay The main character of Galapagos is AI-controlled and only indirectly responds to changes the player makes to its environment. This character is capable of maneuvering through the environment while avoiding surfaces and obstacles it has previously learned is harmful, entirely on its own. However, the creature does not know how to manipulate the levers and switches found throughout the various areas in the game, so it is up to the player to help. As it moves around, the camera angle changes to reveal the new obstacles. Correct manipulation of the devices, through puzzle solving and careful timing, is needed to succeed. Story A synthetic bug-like creature known as Mendel (named after Gregor Mendel, the founder of Mendelian genetics) has just been created in a dystopian lab in the world of Galapagos (a reference to the Galapagos Islands). Mendel is the first of its kind, a prototype which will one day be used to create an army of \\"belligerent autonomous agents, to be used as instruments of dominion, to conquer other worlds for the exploitation of their resources\\". Mendel turns out completely harmless and lonely, so they instead plan to study and dissect the creature to continue their plans of creating a \\"xenocidal war machine\\". The player character has full control over the laboratory environment and wishes to subvert their plans by helping Mendel escape from the lab, and ultimately leave Galapagos. Development The technology used to create Mendel's artificial intelligence is a proprietary system called Non-stationary Entropic Reduction Mapping, or NERM. NERM was designed to be self-organizing, meaning that it does not require prior knowledge of the system that it controls. Mendel was purposely designed to look unlike any real world animal, so that players would not have too many preconceptions about how he should act and what he is capable of. The environments in Galapagos were created with a proprietary tool called Leveller. Reception Reviewers were split on Galapagos: Mendel's Escape. While all praised its innovative use of the NERM system to control Mendel, whether that contributed to an enjoyable game experience was debatable. Common points of complaint included the slow movement for Mendel, the poor camera angles, and the frustration of waiting for Mendel to make the correct decisions. Stephen Poole of GameSpot described the NERM system as \\"a technology in search of a home\\", concluding that the game could be described in four words: \\"great idea, questionable implementation\\". Kathy Tafel of MacAddict said of the game, \\"it can be exceedingly frustrating. [...] in Galapagos the game moves the camera at will (although it's generally centered on Mendel). This can make parts of the game almost impossible to play.\\" Next Generation reviewed the Macintosh version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Enjoying Galapagos requires time, patience, and imagination. Otherwise, it might be easier to stick to games that never access anything higher than the spinal cord.\\" References Category:1997 video games Category:Action video games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Mac OS games Category:Windows games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Galapagos (video game)"},{"id":"42805020","text":"This article displays the qualifying draw for men's singles at the 2014 French Open.

He has dedicated his professional career to the study and execution of sacred art and liturgical design. His life-long commitment to his profession began after he emigrated from Germany at age eight and became an apprentice to his father, the self- taught liturgical artist Rudolph N. Rohn and founder of Rudolph N. Rohn Art Studios in Pittsburgh, PA. Rolf majored in Art History and Theology at local Duquesne University, taking over the family business after the death of his father in 1975. He has continued his education over the years by studying ancient liturgical art, techniques and architecture in cities all over the world. Rolf spends several months a year in Italy sourcing new artisans and maintaining close working relationships with carefully selected craftsmen. He has worked on over 2,500 projects in both the United States and Europe. Design philosophy Rolf specializes in the liturgical development and implementation of comprehensive worship environments from programming, fundraising support, space and functional needs formation to liturgical art and preservation of environments, lighting and design, using the guidelines articulated in the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' Built of Living Stones: Art, Architecture and Worship, as well as the General Instruction of the Roman Missal, the Rite for the Dedication of a Church and Altar, the Rites for Holy Communion and Worship of the Eucharist Outside Mass and other Church documents. Rolf voiced his philosophy and approach to projects in the June 20, 2010 issue of the Orlando Sentinel, citing as an example a Pentecostal scene commissioned by the Catholic Diocese of Orlando for the St. James Cathedral: ‚Äúthrough the years, the artists have become teachers‚Äîeducating ministers and congregations about how art and liturgy work together‚Ä¶she is Mary, but she is much more than that. She represents the Church here and now.‚Äù Of Catholic worship and its supporting environments, he has stated that they have completely different functional needs ‚Äì including lighting, lighting control, sound and acoustical needs. Most important, these Catholic worship environments are designed from the altar table outward, and space formation, active and passive spaces and sightlines that interact to bring either harmony or confusion. His desire is to create as much harmony into the Catholic environment as possible to promote a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. Projects Rolf will be an integral part of the team to develop and oversee the major renovation of the historic Basilica of Saint Patrick‚Äôs Old Cathedral in lower Manhattan. He also been commissioned with the master planning for the Cathedral of Toledo in Ohio; the design and construction phases at the Cathedral of Steubenville in Ohio; and the large presentation hall for St. John‚Äôs Seminary in Brighton, Massachusetts. He has worked on St. Anthony Cathedral in Beaumont, TX; St. James Cathedral in Orlando, FL; St. John the Baptist Cathedral in Savannah, GA; St. Joseph Basilica in Webster, MA, St. Paul Cathedral in Worcester, MA; St. Peter‚Äôs Cathedral in Erie, PA; and St. Peter in Chains Cathedral in Cincinnati, OH. Pope Francis recently named St. Mary‚Äôs Basilica in Marietta, Ohio, a Minor Basilica after its revitalization under Rolf‚Äôs direction. He has also completed projects at the ICTE Chapel of the Pontifical North American College at the Vatican City in Rome, Italy; the Immaculate Conception Chapel at Mount St. Mary's Seminary in Cincinnati, OH; Our Savior Parish at the USC Caruso Center in Los Angeles, CA; St. Louise de Marillac in Pittsburgh, PA; Saint John the Evangelist at St. John Seminary in Boston, MA; and Our Lady of Guadalupe Adoration Chapel in Fargo, ND. Press Famed architect and professor, Dr. Nikos Salingaros, described Rolf‚Äôs innovative liturgical design work at the Co-Cathedral of the Sacred Heart in Houston, Texas: ‚ÄúHarmonious ornamentation achieved through multiple symmetries nourishes our senses and creates in us a healing state. As human beings, we always anthropomorphize our gods, and expect that they share our own higher pleasures. For this reason, our love of God moves us to ornament the place where we worship, and to do so in a totally selfless manner. We wish to create an environment of maximal transcendent pleasure using an understanding that arises from our own physical experience. Most important, I see a fundamental humility in the Houston Cathedral, quite a feat expressed in such a large and imposing building, and in my mind, this modesty is closer to the early Church doctrine.‚Äù (Chiesa Oggi, Edition #87) Rolf‚Äôs stained glass and mosaic designs at St. John Neumann Catholic Church in Austin, Texas, have appeared in Stained Glass Quarterly. Rolf designed the entire environment with ‚ÄúTrinity through the Cross‚Äù as the central theme of the unique church dome, with its transepts and balcony uniting to form a triangle and cross representing the Holy Trinity. Once completed, the record-breaking 76‚Äô diameter dome mosaic will be the largest in Texas and one of the ten largest in the United States. Houston's PBS Arts Insight also recently featured stained glass windows he custom-designed for St. Paul the Apostle Catholic Church in Nassau Bay, Texas. The colorful celestial-inspired windows based on images of stars from the Hubble Telescope invite a look heavenward while honoring the local NASA space program. In 2012, Rolf served on a jury with other elite liturgical professionals for the prestigious IFRAA/Faith & Form Awards Program for Religious Arts and Architecture in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Annual Religious Art and Architecture Design Awards program is co-sponsored by Faith & Form Magazine and the Interfaith Forum on Religion, Art and Architecture (IFRAA), a knowledge community of the American Institute of Architects with the goal of honoring the best in architecture, liturgical design and art for religious spaces. Philanthropy Rolf has sponsored both the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Conference for Catholic Facility Management for many years, the latter of which featured his custom-designed bronze Stations of the Cross and exterior landscaping/lighting plan for the Virgen de San Juan del Valle Shrine in San Juan, Texas, in their newsletter. His charitable three-year mission to design and furbish the Philippines Capuchin Friars in Papua New Guinea‚Äôs new chapel in Bomana, as well as their donated San Damiano cross, was recently featured in the August 2012 Capuchin Missionary Partner Update. Rolf‚Äôs native Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (December 12, 2012 issue) featured the donated repair of a damaged baby Jesus for the city‚Äôs Trinity Cathedral.

Sir Edward Bromley (1563‚Äì1626) was an English lawyer, judge, landowner and politician of the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods. A member of a Shropshire legal and landed gentry dynasty, he was prominent at the Inner Temple and became a Baron of the Exchequer. He was elected MP for Bridgnorth on six consecutive occasions.Hasler: BROMLEY, Edward (1563‚Äì1626), of Shifnall Grange and Bridgnorth, Salop. ‚Äì Author: W.J.J. Background St Peter's church at Worfield Sir Thomas Bromley, Edward's uncle, who became Lord Chancellor Edward Bromley was the second son ofGrazebrook and Rylands, volume 1, p. 78Rylands, p.49 :*Sir George Bromley of Hallon, near Worfield, in Shropshire, the son of George Bromley of Hodnet. Sir George, like his father, was an important figure at the Inner Temple and a considerable politician on the regional stage, becoming chief legal officer of the Council in the Marches of Wales and chief justice of Chester.Hasler: BROMLEY, George (c.1526‚Äì89), of Hallon in Worfield, Salop and the Inner Temple, London ‚Äì Author: N.M. Fuidge. His career was, however, overshadowed by that of his younger brother, Edward's uncle, Thomas Bromley, who became Lord Chancellor. :*Joan Waverton, the daughter of John Waverton of Worfield. The name is also rendered Wannerton, as on her tomb,Randall, p.39Grazebrook and Rylands, volume 2, p.492 and Waterton. The Wavertons had held Hallon (also rendered \\"Hawne\\")Randall, p.85 for probably only one generation. On acquiring it through marriage, George Bromley had made it his seat and the family home. Edward Bromley's elder brother, Francis, was the heir to the Bromley estates. He had two more brothers and three sisters, who all married into regionally powerful gentry families. The gentry dominated Shropshire and, generally, its boroughs politically and culturally, as there was unusually no resident aristocracy in the county.Coulton, p.40 =Family Tree= Education and legal training Edward Bromley was sent to Shrewsbury School in 1577 at about the age of 14. The school was explicitly committed to a Christian and humanist ethos,Coulton, p.53 reflecting Calvinist principles. The first head Thomas Ashton had established a tradition of using drama to develop students' confidence and self-expression.Coulton, p.54 Bromley was admitted to the Inner Temple by its parliament on 27 November 1580: a special admission, without cost, in recognition of his father's status.Inderwick, volume 1, p.310. An undated note states that he was in debt to the treasurer, Andrew Gray, to the tune of 20 marks: Gray was treasurer during 1585‚Äì6. Bromley's call to the bar was noted by the parliament on 5 July 1590.Inderwick, volume 1, p.368. The same meeting noted that he was permitted to use a chamber over the buttery, which had been restored by Michael Lowe, and was used also by his nephew, Humphrey Lowe. In 1595 the shared chamber fell into disrepair and the Inner Temple itself was forced to take action, spending ¬£40 on repairs and subsequently billing Lowe and his relative Abney, for 20 marks each.Inderwick, volume 1, p.407. The chamber seems to have become a family institution, with Bromley on a similar footing to Lowe's blood relations. The association was entirely reciprocal: In November 1590 Lowe, a chief clerk of the King's Bench, was accorded a seat next to Bromley and \\"ancienty\\" of those under Bromley, i.e. recognised as their co-tutor.Inderwick, volume 1, p.371. Bromley's marriage to Margaret Lowe in April 1593Thrush and Ferris: BROMLEY, Edward (1563‚Äì1626), of the Inner Temple, London and Hallon, Worfield, Salop ‚Äì Author: Simon Healy was one result of this close association. Bromley went on to achieve prominence at the Inner Temple. He was called to the bench on 19 May 1603.Inderwick, volume 2, p.2 Responsibilities, minor at first, quickly followed. In June 1604 it was steward for the Reader's dinner,Inderwick, volume 2, p.4 and in November auditor for the steward's accounts,Inderwick, volume 2, p.6 and in April 1605 he and Sir Edward Coke were nominated as attendants to the ReaderInderwick, volume 2, p.9 ‚Äì generally a signal that the appointee was himself to receive this high academic honour in the near future.

After this his career took a turn towards the administration of justice. Parliamentary career =Elizabethan parliament= Bromley's parliamentary career unfolded alongside his progress at his Inn of Court. He was returned as an MP for Bridgnorth at every election between 1586 and 1604 ‚Äì a total of six times. Bridgnorth was a small town, governed by a council of two bailiffs and 24 aldermen.Hasler: Bridgnorth ‚Äì Author: J.J.C. Although the council nominally selected the MP, with the consent of the burgesses, the Council in the Marches and local gentry effectively shared parliamentary representation, ensuring that lawyers monopolised the seats.Thrush and Ferris: Bridgnorth ‚Äì Author: Simon Healy Bromley would have had little difficulty in securing election, as he had leverage on all counts. He was a landowner based very locally and Sir George Bromley, his father, was both acting head of the Council in the Marches, between the death of Henry Sidney and the arrival of his successor, and recorder of Bridgnorth. In 1586, 1588, 1593 and 1597 Bromley took the first of the two seats, with John Lutwich as his colleague. Lutwich shared Bromley's social and professional background: a Shropshire landowner prominent in London at Lincoln's Inn.Hasler: LUTWICH, John (c.1543‚Äì1615), of Lincoln's Inn, London and Shipton Hall, Salop. ‚Äì Author: J.J.C. In the last of the Elizabethan parliaments, elected in October 1601, Bromley was outranked by Thomas Horde, who had succeeded Sir George as recorder in 1589, and took the second seat. Bromley made no impact on the work of the Elizabethan House of Commons. =First parliament of James I= In 1604 Bromley was elected to the first parliament of James I, which was to last until 1611. This time he took second place to Sir Lewis Lewknor, a colourful scholar of Catholic leanings,Thrush and Ferris: LEWKNOR, Sir Lewis (c.1560‚Äì1627), of Selsey, Suss. and Red Cross Street, London; later of Drury Lane, Mdx. ‚Äì Author: Alan Davidson who had been appointed the king's Master of the Ceremonies. Lewknor probably owed his election to the influence of his uncle, Sir Richard Lewknor, chief justice of Chester and an influential member of the Council in the Marches. Bromley left some traces in the record of the parliament, but despite his legal qualifications and acumen, was not as active as Lewknor. Bromley was sent to confer with the House of Lords on the king's proposals for a Union of the kingdoms of Scotland and England. He was also instructed to draft a bill to exclude \\"outlaws\\" ‚Äì in this context referring to recusants as well as perjurers and forgers ‚Äì from Parliament. This was a response to the election of Francis Goodwin to represent Buckinghamshire, which was challenged by the sheriff and led to a wrangle between king and parliament.Thrush and Ferris: GOODWIN, Sir Francis (1564‚Äì1634), of Upper Winchendon, Bucks. and Westminster, Mdx. ‚Äì Author: Simon Healy The proposed bill was a sop to the king: although Bromley and others were appointed to a committee, it was allowed to fade from attention and no report was ever produced. As he was a trustee of the Worcestershire estates of Thomas Lyttelton, he was made chairman of the committee which prepared a bill to rehabilitate John Lyttelton, Thomas's father, who was attainted and died in prison after the Essex Rebellion of 1601. This was business of great importance to the Bromley family, as John Lyttelton's widow and Thomas's mother was Meriel Bromley, Edward Bromley's cousin and a daughter of Thomas Bromley, the former Lord Chancellor.Sir Henry Bromley, Meriel's brother and a close friend of Edward, sat alongside him on the committee.Thrush and Ferris: BROMLEY, Sir Henry (c.1560‚Äì1615), of Holt Castle, Worcs., Shrawardine Castle, Salop and St. Lawrence Pountney, London; later of Westminster. ‚Äì Author: Ben Coates Bromley was compelled to resign his parliamentary seat in February 1610, when he was made a judge, occasioning a contested by-election ‚Äì a very rare event. =Continuing political interest= Although Bromley never stood again for parliament, he remained influential at Bridgnorth and at Much Wenlock, in both of which he later became recorder. He seems to have avoided direct involvement in a bitterly contested by-election to find his successor at Bridgnorth, although the ultimate victor was Sir Francis Lacon, a Catholic sympathiserThrush and Ferris: LACON, Sir Francis (1568/9-1642/7), of Willey and Kinlet, Salop ‚Äì Author: Simon Healy who was Bromley's cousin, once removed.Grazebrook and Rylands, volume 2, p.308 His main interest was in the constituency of Much Wenlock, which was small and easier to manipulate. Bromley's nephew, Thomas Wolryche of Dudmaston Hall, was returned as MP in 1621, 1624 and 1625.Thrush and Ferris: WOLRYCHE (WOOLRIDGE), Thomas (1598‚Äì1668), of Dudmaston, Salop. ‚Äì Author: Simon Healy Judicial career As late as 23 January 1610 John Chamberlain, the noted letter writer, described Bromley \\"an obscure lawyer of the Inner Temple.\\" Within two weeks he was promoted to the higher ranks of the judiciary. Serjeant's Inn as it appeared in the early 19th century. It was destroyed in World War II. On 5 February 1610 Bromley, along with Sir John Denham,Foss, p.29 was made a Serjeant-at-law, one of an elite corps of barristers. The promotion was for the express purpose of making him a judge. Only Bromley and Sir Edward Coke received the Call to the Coif for this purpose in the reign of James I.Foss, p.31 He was presented with a purse containing ¬£10 by the treasurer of the Inner Temple. The benchers and fellows of the Inner Temple then accompanied him in procession to Serjeant's Inn, where he was robed, and then to Westminster for his inauguration.Inderwick, volume 2, p.47 Next day, 6 February, Bromley was appointed a Baron of the Exchequer in place of Edward Heron, who had died after serving only a little over two years.Foss, p.160 The Barons were judges in the Exchequer of Pleas, a court which dealt with important equity cases. He was the third in his family to be \\"adorned with the judicial ermine,\\" after Chief Justice Thomas Bromley, and the Lord Chancellor. When he went to the Exchequer on his first day of service, wearing his judge's ermine, the entire available membership of the Inner Temple and the Inns of Chancery preceded him on foot. On 26 February he was knighted at the Palace of Whitehall.Shaw, p.149 Bromley held his post at the Exchequer until his death, serving for all but the last year under Sir Lawrence Tanfield, the Chief Baron of the Exchequer, and sitting alongside Denham from 1617.Foss, p.12-13 Bromley and Denham had their patents renewed on the accession of Charles I in March 1625.Foss, p.222 Tanfield died a month after being reappointed and was replaced by Sir John Walter.Foss, p.221-2 Alongside his work in London at the Exchequer, Bromley also operated as a justice of assize, working on the Northern circuit from 1610 until 1618, when he moved to the Midland circuit. Before his transfer he had been appointed recorder of Much Wenlock in Shropshire and thereafter he took recorderships at two more towns in his own county: Shrewsbury and Bridgnorth. Landowner As a second son, Edward Bromley can have had little expectation of inheriting substantial estates. He was installed in a modest property of the Bromley patrimony at Shifnal, which became his seat: he was known as ‚Äúof Shifnall Grange‚Äù in his early career. When Sir George Bromley died in 1589, the estates passed to his first son, Francis Bromley, who thus held land at Hodnet, Wistanswick, and Allerton, as well as his mother's estate of Hallon and other lands in the Bridgnorth area.Hasler: BROMLEY, Francis (c.1556‚Äì91), of Hodnet, Salop. ‚Äì Author: W.J.J. He survived for less than two years. The Bromley estates then passed to his young son, Thomas. Edward Bromley, meanwhile, start to build up his own landholding, in 1593 marrying the coheiress to the small estate of Tysoe, near Enville, in neighbouring Staffordshire, who brought a scattering of land across the Midlands. From this point he began to occupy a selection of the local and regional offices that pertained to the landed gentry. By 1595 he was serving as a Justice of the Peace for Shropshire. In 1603 he became steward of Morfa Forest in the west of the county. After the Gunpowder Plot he was appointed to the commission which investigated the conspirators' lands in Shropshire. He was a commissioner for the subsidy in 1608. Most of these posts brought some profit as well as responsibility. Only two weeks after Edward Bromley became Baron of the Exchequer, his nephew Thomas died, leaving him as heir to the entailed Bromley estates. However, matters were not so clear-cut at Hallon itself. Francis Bromley also left a daughter, Jane, who had married William Davenport, allegedly after a secret and forbidden courtship.Randall, p.88-9 Jane and William Davenport now laid claim to Hallon and the other lands that had been inherited through Edward and Francis's mother, Jane Waverton or Wannerton. Although Bromley now regarded Hallon as his seat, Davenport was described as \\"of Hawne\\" in the Heraldic Visitation of 1623.Grazebrook and Rylands, volume 2, p.493 The dispute lasted for decades, with Hallon finally in the hands of the Davenport family and becoming their seat, Davenport House. Death Epitaph of Sir Edward Bromley Sir Richard Hutton, a friend of Bromley and, with Denham, an overseer of his will. Bromley died on 2 June 1626. He was interred in St Peter's church at Worfield. In his will, dated 14 October 1625,Abstract of will in Fletcher, p.71-2 he asks for a night burial two days after his death \\"without funeral pompe.\\" It appears that the Inner Temple had already installed a stained glass window displaying Bromley's armorial bearings and this was restored some time shortly after his death, presumably as a mark of respect.Inderwick, volume 2, p.171 Bromley left ¬£100 for \\"a monument to be set up in Shifnall church or elsewhere\\". He had installed a fine alabaster monument for his parents at Worfield and may have doubted it would be available. In the event, a substantial alabaster tomb was built at Worfield and dedicated to him by his wife. His epitaph reads: : Spiritus astra petit. (Latin: The spirit strives for the stars.) :Here resteth the Bodie of Sir Edward Bromley, Knight, second Baron of Exchequer, being second sonne of Sir George Bromley, Knight, and of Dame Jane his wife. Who married Margaret one of the daughters and coheirs of Michael Lowe, of Tymore, in the County of Stafford, Esquire and died without issue, the second of June 1626. Dame Margaret his wife according to his will did dedicate this monument to his memory. The tomb stood at the east end of the north aisle, together with his parents' tomb. The Bromley tombs were moved further west in 1866, following major restoration work to the church. The entailed patrimonial lands automatically went to Bromley's younger brother, George. Edward Bromley left plate to the value of ¬£20 to each of his godchildren, Thomas Wolryche and Thomas and Dorothy Cotton. He had hoped to give his wife the use of his possessions during her lifetime but ultimately to have them divided among his godsons and servants. He had thought to secure Hallon and his mother's other lands by paying off Thomas Bromley's creditors with ¬£700 but Jane and William Davenport were still pressing their claim. This affected an arrangement he had made with his wife, assigning her some of the properties as part of her jointure. Almost at the last moment he had attached a codicil giving all his personal property to his wife in compensation for her likely losses. He appointed as overseers of his will his three sisters, his brother-in-law Cotton and his friends, the judges John Denham and Sir Richard Hutton: both were later to defy Charles I over ship money. He left small sums for the poor of Worfield, Bridgnorth, Shifnal, Much Wenlock, Shrewsbury and Sheriffhales. Marriage and family Edward Bromley married Margaret Lowe, daughter and heiress of Nicholas Lowe of Tymore, in the parish of Enville, Staffordshire on 18 March 1593. The marriage was without issue. Bromley cultivated close links with his godchildren, who were the children of his sisters, and with his cousins, the Bromleys of Worcestershire, particularly Sir Henry Bromley and his children. In October 1615 he arranged for the Inner Temple to admit Philip, one of Sir Henry's sons, whom he hoped to adopt as his heir, along with his own nephew, Thomas Wolryche,Inderwick, volume 2, p.91 and, few months later, George Wolryche and John Lyttelton, a son of Meriel Bromley, were similarly admitted.Inderwick, volume 2, p.95 Philip Bromley seems to have predeceased him. After a marriage of 33 years to Bromley, Lady Margaret Bromley was his widow for more than 30: she was buried on 23 March 1657 at Loughborough in Leicestershire, where she had lived in her later years.Fletcher, p.70 The austerity shown in her husband's will was amplified in hers, which was dated 6 March 1657.Fletcher, p.73 She asked that only one nephew, James Abney, attend her funeral and that even bell ringing be avoided. Most of the bequests relate to Abney and to other nephews and nieces, the Bromskills. Calamy, the historian who collated information about the Great Ejection, added a supplementary note to his account of Leicestershire for the 1702 edition: :Loughborough : Mr. OLIVER BRUMSKILL. Add; He was a judicious solid Divine, and excellent Preacher, and holy Liver. He liv'd with that eminent Saint, the old Lady Bromley, Widow to Judge Bromley.Calamy, p.581 Bromskill, a Presbyterian minister of the Commonwealth period, was evidently related to Lady Bromley by marriage and her active support for his ministry, as well as Calamy's encomium, makes clear that she was a committed Puritan.

Ravindra Gaikwad himself has various criminal charges against him which include voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servants from duty, criminal intimidation and rioting among others. On 23 March 2017, while travelling to Delhi from Pune, he was accused of hitting an Air India staff with his shoe 25 times and attempting to throw him out of the plane. This act led all of the Indian Airline companies to impose a No-Fly ban on him. He mentioned that he is not a BJP member to tolerate the scolding. Delhi police filed two criminal charges on him: one for hitting the government staff on duty and the other for taking the plane ransom without departing from the plane. In 2014 he was in a row over trying to force-feed a Muslim caterer during the fasting month of Ramzan. In April 2017, Ravindra Gaikwad and his supporters were booked for unlawful assembly, misbehaviour and causing disorder at a public place following an incident in Latur, Maharashtra, where he allegedly behaved rudely with police officials, staged an agitation and shouted slogans. This was in response to his inability to get money from an ATM. He expressed concerns about lack of availability of cash despite significant passage of time after demonetization.

Koss (born Mary Lyndon Pease) is an American Regents' Professor at the University of Arizona, Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health in Tucson, Arizona. Her best known works have been in the areas of gender-based violence and restorative justice. In 1987, Koss, along with her colleagues, Christine Gidycz and Nadine Wisniewski, published the first national study on rape. The study included the first presentation of the \\"one in four\\" statistic that created awareness of the extent of rape among college students, the development of a method for measuring rape, and coining terms such as \\"date rape\\" and \\"acquaintance rape\\". Biography Koss was born in Louisville, Kentucky. Koss's maternal grandparents (William and Marian Lyndon Bade) raised her and her four siblings for a period of time, while their mother rehabilitated from polio. Upon graduating high school at age 17, Koss attended the University of Michigan, where she met her husband, Paul G. Koss. After receiving her A.B. in Psychology with high distinction, she continued her education at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities along with her husband. While he completed his medical degree, she pursued a PhD in Clinical Psychology. After receiving her doctorate, she completed her clinical psychology residency at the Minneapolis Veterans Administration Medical Center, where she worked with Vietnam War veterans in the area of rehabilitation psychology. Career A letter addressed to Mary Koss written by Chairman Joe Biden Koss joined the faculty of St. Olaf College as an assistant professor in August 1973. She then transferred to a research university, Kent State in 1976. During her time there, Mary Harvey, of Victims of Violence Center and National Institute of Mental Health, recruited her to lead a study on rape prevalence in collaboration with the Ms. Foundation for Research and Education. The project was federally funded through a competitive grants award process. Koss' work resulted in the 1987 publication, \\"The Scope of Rape: Incidence and Prevalence of Sexual Aggression and Victimization in a National Sample of Higher Education Students.\\" This was the first national, large-scale survey on rape of its kind. As a result of this and other works, Koss has been credited with coining the terms \\"date rape\\", \\"hidden rape\\", \\"unacknowledged rape\\", \\"acquaintance rape\\", and \\"campus rape\\". She also published \\"The Hidden Rape Victim: Personality, Attitudinal and Situational Characteristics.\\" In that paper, she defined the hidden rape victim as, \\"one who has never reported her experience to a rape crisis center or to police.\\" Koss defined the unacknowledged rape victims as women who have experienced the behaviors that define rape (oral, anal, or vaginal penetration against consent through force, bodily harm, or when incapacitated and unable to consent) but do not realize that their experience constitutes rape or chose not to view it that way.Koss & Oros. (1980). \\"The 'Unacknowledged' Rape Victim.\\" This is now a well-accepted finding reaffirmed by other investigators in national surveys repeated in the early 2000s and most recently reported in 2012. Koss has served as an invited speaker and guest lecturer around the world. In 1991, she testified as an expert witness at the U.S. Senate hearings that led to the first passage of Violence Against Women Act. Koss was offered a faculty position in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Arizona in 1987 and later transferred to the Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health. Koss has been at the University of Arizona for 27 years, earning tenure in 1988 and designation Regents' Professor in November 2006. In her academic career, Koss has published close to 300 works on violence against women, including 145 peer-reviewed scientific articles as well as books, book chapters, and briefs. In addition to the Ms. Study, Koss has led 10 other federally funded research projects. Restorative justice programs At the University of Arizona, Koss pioneered a restorative justice program, RESTORE. RESTORE is a voluntary conferencing program for adult misdemeanor and felony sexual assault perpetrators who are referred by a prosecutor. \\"The RESTORE Program for Restorative Justice for Sex Crimes: Vision, Process and Outcomes\\" is published in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence. \\"The paper is the first peer-reviewed quantitative evaluation of RJ conferencing for adult sexual assault.\\" Koss and her colleagues from The University of Michigan and Carleton College also collaborated on the article titled, \\"Campus Sexual Misconduct: Restorative Justice Approaches to Enhance Compliance with Title IX Guidance.\\" This article is published in Trauma, Violence and Abuse: A Review Journal.

Career Foley graduated from Simmons College in 1983 with a degree in technical journalism. In 1984 she interviewed the then head of Microsoft, Bill Gates, for a cover story in Electronic Business magazine. The interview was held at the Microsoft booth of the annual COMDEX technology exhibition. During the interview, Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs, whom Foley did not know, walked up and began chatting with Gates. Eventually Foley grew impatient and told Jobs that she was trying to do an interview, and asked him to come back later. Jobs walked away, and Gates then explained to Foley that she had just sent away the head of Apple. In 1991 she was hired by the magazine PCWeek, later renamed to eWeek, and moved to San Francisco. In 1993 she was offered the newly vacant post of Microsoft reporter, and moved to Seattle, Washington, near Microsoft's Redmond, Washington headquarters.

It was built in 1916 and is attached to the historic Perry McAdow House. History The 1916 church building was designed by Donaldson and Meier in the Neo-Gothic style. It was constructed by the Universalist Church of Our Father as a replacement for an 1881 Romanesque-Revival church building on Grand Circus Park in the outskirts of downtown Detroit. The new church was built on a rose garden on the property of the Perry McAdow House which was purchased in 1913 by the Universalists. In 1932, the First Unitarian Church of Detroit decided to move as the widening of Woodward Avenue necessitated cutting off the front of their building at Edmund Place. They moved in with the Universalists in 1932 and formerly merged in 1934, forming the First Unitarian-Universalist Church of Detroit. In 2011, the church donated the complex of buildings, including the sanctuary and attached church house with social hall and second story church, to the East Michigan Environmental Action Council (EMEAC). The church is now part of the EMEAC managed Cass Corridor Commons, a multi-use non-profit and green space in which educational activities, community efforts and business endeavors are created and carried out.

Families often build the cars themselves in accordance with the construction specifications provided in the NYSMA plan book. History The sport originated in Skaneateles, NY in 1954 when Edwin Robinson Sr. and his son Edwin (Bob) Robinson Jr. designed the original wood-frame microd. After local children began driving the cars around the village streets, the village approached the Robinsons to develop the first microd track.

The rokosz was started in defence of the so-called Golden Liberty, as Lubomirski feared royal plans for strengthening the position of the king and introduction of the so-called vivente rege election. The Battle of Matwy, which was the last battle of the rebellion, took place on 13 July 1666. After this bloodbath, which ended in the defeat of royal forces, both sides signed the agreement, according to which Lubomirski was returned all his titles, and the king was forced to abandon his election plans and reforms of the state. Furthermore, royal amnesty for rebels was declared. The rebellion weakened the prestige of Jan Kazimierz and his bold plans. From then on, Polish-Lithuanian nobility disrespected the king, which contributed to his decision to abandon the throne in 1668.

It took place on 13 July 1666 in the village of MƒÖtwy (now a district of Inowroc≈Çaw), and ended in rebel victory. The royal army of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth lost almost 4000 of its best and most experiences soldiers, who were murdered by Lubomirski's men. Rebel losses are estimated at approximately 200. The battle On 12 July, first royal divisions appeared in MƒÖtwy. A skirmish with rebel forces, which guarded the Noteƒá river ford soon took place. On the next day, other royal forces, consisting mostly of Lithuanian units appeared. Taking advantage of a fog, several hundred cavalrymen managed to cross the river, and soon afterwards, remaining royal divisions began to cross the Noteƒá. Lithuanian hetman Micha≈Ç Kazimierz Pac however missed a chance to shatter rebel army, and decided to wait for Crown divisions. The defeat of royal forces was the result of several mistakes. Other from Pac's delay, royal leaders did not know exact positions of the rebels, thinking that their main units were located far from the ford. Furthermore, they did not get acquainted with the topography of the area. King John II Casimir, unaware of the danger, ordered the crossing of the whole army, which consisted of some 20,000 men. First, Lithuanian dragoons and reiters got to the other bank of the Noteƒá, followed by cavalry and Polish dragoons (altogether, some 4000 men). Next were two cavalry divisions of Mikolaj Hieronim Sieniawski and John Sobieski. There was no cooperation between all these units, and after crossing of the Noteƒá, royal army created battle formation, with Lithuanian cavalry on the left, Crown dragoons in the middle and Crown cavalry on the right. Sobieski made a fatal mistake, placing the cavalry in front of the dragoons, as before the end of the battle, retreating cavalrymen trampled the foot soldiers. Meanwhile, Zarudny, who commanded front guard of the rebels, managed to retreat to a nearby hill, which he kept despite Lithuanian attacks. Soon afterwards, rebel cavalry, pospolite ruszenie and other forces joined Zarudny and his men. The cavalry of Sieniawski and Sobieski, pressed by other units, which were trying to cross the river, got mixed with dragoons, located in the center. At the same time, rebel cavalry charged, followed by pospolite ruszenie from Greater Poland and Lesser Poland. This attack took royal army by complete surprise: their cavalry was quickly destroyed, and signal to retreat was announced. Retreating cavalrymen trampled the dragoons: Sobieski tried to save the situation by ordering two cavalry units to attack, but this failed, and the future king himself had to retreat himself, narrowly escaping death. Lithuanian cavalry also retreated, leaving the dragoons to themselves. The river ford was filled with equipment, men and their horses, so under the circumstances, Jan Kazimierz ordered general retreat, abandoning those units which continued to fight. Following the battle, the rebels mercilessly murdered thousands of their prisoners, including some of the best soldiers of Poland and Lithuania.  Consequences of the Battle  The bloodbath and subsequent mass murder resulted in deaths of 3873 royal soldiers and 200 rebels. Most of the victims were most experienced and best military men of the two nations, including soldiers of Stefan Czarniecki, who had fought in the Ukraine, Muscovy and Denmark. Czarniecki himself did not participate in the battle, as he had died a few months before. Two weeks after the battle the Agreement of ≈Åƒôgonice was signed.

She was one out of a total of two female chemical engineers at Stephan Company in 1993. Brown served was a lifelong active member of the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) and served as the society's seventh president from 1961 to 1963. She co- founded the Detroit section of SWE in 1952. She was one of the first members, a Charter Member, of the South Ohio SWE section. When she arrived in Dallas, there was no regional section of SWE, so she kept in touch at the national level. She was a key Member in helping keep SWE afloat in the late 1950s, when money was scarce and membership was low. While Brown was president of SWE, she worked with Lillian Moller Gilbreth to help advance SWE's goals to encourage women engineers to succeed. As president, because of a minor miscommunication, Brown presented an honorary award to Marlene Schmidt, a German engineer who was also Miss Universe at the time. She attempted to persuade Grace Hopper to help SWE's cause as well, but Hopper did not believe in a separate society for women. Career and education Brown graduated from Southwestern Louisiana Institute as the first female chemical engineer. Then she earned her master's degree in chemistry from the University of Texas. Brown taught chemistry at Smith College. She became a research associate at Albany Medical College. Then she worked for Ethyl Corporation in Detroit. Here, she began her career as a technical information resources specialist. In 1955, Brown became a technical writer at Bettis Atomic Power Division Westinghouse. Then she became an Information Services Supervisor at Texas Instruments in 1957. She left Texas Instruments to do research in information storage and retrieval at Battelle Memorial Institute. After that, she worked in technical information management at Baxter Laboratories in Illinois. Brown remained in the field of information and research for the rest of her career until her retirement from Stepan Company. She learned skills in data analysis, system design, reporting and publishing, computer operations and management.

Early life  Ali was born as Muhammad Utteng Ali in the village of Bulukumba in Kajang district of Bulukumba Regency in South Sulawesi, Indonesia on October 5, 1967. He is the third of six children (though only five survived into adulthood). His parents were a couple with farming background, Ali Kadrun (father) and Inong Tippangrom (mother). His parents were not religious, but they wanted him to learn how to read the Koran, so they sent him to Daarul Arqam Islamic boarding school. During his childhood, Utteng (as he used to be called) was rebellious, lazy and often truant. He was one time detained for hitting a student named Mustafa, breaking his nose and sending him to the hospital. Mustafa's parents then called the police and they arrested him, though he was not entirely guilty. Finally Utteng was jailed for two weeks. Fortunately, he was not expelled from the boarding school due to the incident. His name was changed from Utteng to Shamsi (an Arabic word which means Sun) when he and his father met with the Daarul Arqam school headmaster, Abdul Jabbar Asyiri. The headmaster argued that in Islam, the name is a prayer and should have a good sense, and he eventually renamed his middle name from Utteng to Shamsi with hope, Utteng could be the praiseworthy one (from his first name) and can illuminate (from his middle name, with the same way the sun does) people's hearts.  Education  After completing primary school at age 12 in the village of Tana Toa in Bulukumba Regency, his parents sent him to Darul-Arqam pesantren (Islamic boarding school) in Makassar, which is owned by the Muhammadiyah organization. After graduating from the boarding school in 1987, Shamsi Ali stayed there as a teacher until the end of 1988. He received a scholarship offer from Rabithah Alam Islami to study at the International Islamic University, Islamabad, Pakistan. He completed his undergraduate in Tafseer in 1992 and continued his master at the same university in the field of Comparative Religion in 1994. During his study in Pakistan, Shamsi Ali also worked as a lecturer at the school funded by Saudi Arabia, the Red Crescent Society in Islamabad, where later he received an offer to teach at the Islamic Education Foundation in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in early 1995. In 1996 Hajj season, Shamsi Ali got a mandate to speak at the Consulate General of Indonesia in Jeddah. From there, he met with some foreign hajj pilgrims, including the Indonesian Ambassador to the United Nations, Nugroho Wisnumurti, who once offered him to come to New York to build a new mosque for Indonesian community. Shamsi Ali accepted the offer and moved to New York in early 1997. Ali earned Ph.D in Political Science from Southern California University in 2003. Besides Indonesian as his Native Language and Buginese language as his mother-tongue, Ali is also fluent in Arabic, English, and Urdu.  Career  During his study in Islamabad, he was hired as a muezzin in Faisal Mosque, the biggest mosque in the city. He saved money to fund his hajj (pilgrimage) and wedding. After arriving in New York in 1996, he served as an imam to an Indonesian community mosque in Long Island City, Queens. Through funding from the Indonesian Mission to the UN, Bank of Indonesia and the Indonesian consulate of New York, the community purchased a chemical warehouse for $350,000 on the 31st Street and 48th Avenue in Astoria, Queens. In 2001, he was appointed as deputy Imam of Islamic Cultural Center of New York which is the city‚Äôs largest mosque located in 96th street and 3rd Ave in Manhattan, but left the position in 2011. Shamsi Ali is also the Chairman of the Board of Trustees for the ASEAN Muslim Federation of North America. He also serves as the Vice President of the Asian-American Coalition USA (AAC-USA) and its UN Representative and as an Advisory Board member to numerous interfaith organizations, including the Tanenbaum Center and Federation for Middle East Peace. In interfaith organizations, Imam Ali serves as a Board member for the Partnership of Faith in NY, and co-founder of the UNCC (Universal Clergy Coalition-International). Furthermore, he is also Assistant Director and a Board member of the Muslim Foundation of America, Inc., and Chairman of the annual Muslim Day Parade in NYC. A few days after the events of 11 September 2001, New York City chose him to represent the Muslim community to visit the scene, where he met President George W. Bush. He also recited a prayer at the memorial service for the September 11th victims at Yankee stadium in the Bronx. In 2002, Ali was appointed \\"Ambassador for Peace\\" by the International Religious Federation, and a recipient of ICLI Interfaith Award in 2008. Ali was chosen as one of the seven most influential religious leaders in New York City by New York Magazine in 2006. He represented the Muslim community at an interfaith discussion on Religions and Sustainable Development in the White House 2007, and took part in the Transatlantic Interfaith Dialogue in Frankfurt, Germany 2008. Within the Indonesian Muslim community in North America, he serves as an Advisory Board to major national Muslim organizations such as IMSA (Indonesian Muslim Society in America) and ICMI (Indonesian Muslim Intellectual Society in America). He is also the president of Nusantara Foundation, a community based operating and non-profit organization in New York that is established, publicly supported, operated by, and for the benefit of Indonesian culture.  Controversy  Shamsi Ali was accused by some people of Islamic Cultural Center of New York of misconduct during his time as the Imam. Furthermore, some congregations disagreed with his \\"liberal\\" approaches, especially his interfaith activities which they said were controversial. Other people at the mosque accused him not to do good in the wider community, but instead he went out and made friends with Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Kelly. Some people then refused to attend Ali's prayers. His teachings about how to lead a modern Islamic life in a Western society infuriated some congregants. One of scholars in South Africa even issued a fatwa, cautioning Muslims against performing prayers led by Ali. The worst accusation against him was that he had been accused by takfiris of committing apostasy. Some fundamentalist Muslims in Queens disagreed with Ali's approach to youths to be closer to Islam. They accused him of corrupting Muslim youths' mentality by letting them use the mosque's basement for practicing music which they considered haram. They also accused him of being an FBI mouthpiece. On another occasion, this group of people opposed Ali's defense of a Shi'a Muslim who was rallying against terrorism and injustice, whom they considered an infidel. According to Ali, one of these groups is thought to be an American offshoot of the London-based Al-Muhajiroun, which is infamous for its conference \\"The Magnificent 19,\\" praising those who carried out the 9/11 attacks. Ali left his position at ICC of New York (the management at ICC insisted that he was fired) in 2011. He continues his position as the director of Jamaica Muslim Center in Astoria, Queens since 2004 and as the chairman of Al-Hikmah mosque since 1996. In September 2015 Ali sharply criticized Chairman of the DPR of Indonesia, Setya Novanto and its Deputy Speaker Fadli Zon for attending Donald Trump's press conference. Shamsi said the meeting had humiliated Indonesian state leaders and was full of political interests. He said it was obvious that the press conference was part of a campaign event. He further said the presence of Setya and Fadli, who stood behind Trump as the US business tycoon delivered a speech, was deplorable. In addition, according to Imam Shamsi Ali, Donald Trump is known for his racist and anti-immigrant comments, including the anti- Muslim sentiments.  Writings and publications  Ali has written many articles, given speeches and initiated dialogues with various religious leaders about the importance of dialogues among Muslims, Christians, Jews and other religious groups toward peace. He has made countless appearances on TV (ABC, PBS, BBC World, CNN, Fox News, National Geographic, al-Jazeera, the Hallmark Channel) to condemn terrorism, radicalism, anti-Semitism and to promote peaceful Islam. Ali has authored four books: Dai muda di New York City (A Young Dai in New York City), The True Love in America; 29 Kisah Mualaf Amerika (The True Love in America: 29 stories of Muallaf in America), Menebar Damai di Bumi Barat (Spreading Peace in Western World). The former US president Bill Clinton gave a foreword to his fourth book, a memoir, entitled Sons Of Abraham: A Candid Conversation about the Issues That Divide and Unite Jews and Muslims which he co-authored with Marc Schneier, a Jewish rabbi who is also his close friend.  Recognition  Imam Ali was appointed \\"Ambassador for Peace\\" by the International Religious Federation in 2002, and a recipient of the 2008 ICLI Interfaith Award. In 2006, he was named one of seven most influential religious leaders in New York City by New York Magazine. He is also one of 100 recipients of the 2009 Ellis Island Medal of Honor Award. This prestigious non military gold medal is one of the highest awards recognized by US government to native-born and naturalized U.S. citizens with tremendous contributions to the American society and the world and for Shamsi Ali it was due to his endless dedication in building bridges between religious communities. On September 18, 2010 Ali was granted Hall of Fame Award by AACUSA (Asian American Coalition USA) Inc. The award honored Ali as one of the seven outstanding individuals within their respective Asian communities. According to the AACUSA, Dr. Parveen C. Chopra, Shamsi Ali has reached across the division and became part of the Muslims‚Äô voice at the United Nations forums, churches, synagogues, the NYPD, FBI and major news outlets including, ABC, PBS, BBC World, CNN, Fox News, National Geographic, Al-Jazeera and the Hallmark Channel. He was also chosen as one of The 500 Most Influential Muslims in the world in 2009, 2010, and 2011 by the Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Center in Jordan and Georgetown University. In April 2014, NY senate commended him to be the recipient of Turkish Cultural Center's Friendship Award, which he received along with Rabbi Marc Schneier during the ceremony on April 10, 2014 at the Turkish Cultural Center of Queens.  Personal life  Unlike many imams in United States, Ali likes and listens to rap and hip-hop music such as songs produced by hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons. Some people call him \\"Hip Imam\\". Shamsi Ali lives with his wife (Mutiah Malik), four sons (Utsman, Adnan, Shakeel, Ayman) and two daughters (Maryam, Malika).

He was a member of the Senate of Spain between 1979 and 1982 and he served as State Secretary for Autonomous Communities for the Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD) between 1980 and 1982. He was also a member of the Spanish Council of State. Broseta was assassinated by ETA members on 15 February 1992. Early life Broseta was born in Banyeres de Mariola in the Province of Alicante. He however moved to the city of Valencia at an early age and went to school there. His father, a member of the Republican Left was temporarily arrested when Spanish leader Francisco Franco visited Valencia. The incident had a lasting impact on Broseta, which made him value freedom and respect for others throughout the rest of his life. In 1955 he obtained his licentiate in Law from the Universidad Literaria de Valencia. He furthered his academic studies at the Complutense University of Madrid, starting in 1956 and graduating in 1959. He was an assistant and later adjunct professor at the same university until 1964, when he became professor of business law at the University of Valencia. He contributed to the creation of the Faculty of Economic Sciences at the university. He was dean of the Law faculty between 1970 and 1972. During this time he was prosecuted in the Tribunal de Orden P√∫blico for writing an article, he was however absolved of the charge. He resigned as dean in 1972 after the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science intended to purge the Spanish academic life of three hundred professors and over a thousand students for political reasons, as they rose academically against Francoist Spain. In 1973 he was the first signatory of a list requesting a Faculty of Valencian Culture and Language at the University of Valencia. Political career After the 1977 Spanish general election Broseta became an advisor to the President of the Consell of the Valencian Region. Even though Broseta had been politically active he had not joined a party before 1979. He was however seen as close to the Socialist Party of the Valencian Country, and by their support became vice-president of the mixed commission for power transference to the pre-autonomic Valencian Community.Gasc√≥ Escudero, 113 Broseta however did not join the Socialist Party, instead becoming member of the Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD) in January 1979. He was a member of the Senate of Spain for the Province of Valencia between 1 March 1979 and 31 August 1982. In the Senate he served as president of the Commission of Education and Culture for almost two years between 1979 and 1981. At different times he also served in the Commission for Internal Affairs and Justice and the Commission for the Constitution. He also served on the special commission for University teaching problems and the investigatory commission for public order and terrorist acts. In June 1980 Broseta was offered the position of State Secretary for Autonomous Communities. Initially unsure whether to accept, he held the position until 1982.Gasc√≥ Escudero, 115 Within the Valencian UCD he allied himself with Fernando Abril Martorell, who served in the Congress of Deputies and Jos√© Luis Manglano de Mas, who served as a member of the municipal council of Valencia. Together the three men supported the Valencian political cause. After the disintegration of the UCD in 1983 Broseta left politics. In September 1982 he had already made plans to leave the UCD as he felt it was no longer his party. He left at the same time as Manglano.Gasc√≥ Escudero, 71 As a politician Broseta was a supporter of anti-Catalanism and as a Valencian of Blaverism. He rejected the idea that the Valencian Community belonged to the Pa√Øsos Catalans and he was a critic of Catalan leader Jordi Pujol.Gasc√≥ Escudero, 114 Later life After his time in politics Broseta returned to Valencia and focused on his academic life once more. He was awarded a Cross of Honour of the Order of St. Raymond of Pe√±afort in 1985. In 1987 he was made Elected member of the Spanish Council of State. On 26 March 1990 he was made Chevalier (Knight) in the French Legion of Honour. In 1991 Broseta refused an offer to lead the party list of the Partido Popular (PP) in the municipal elections of Valencia. PP Senator Jos√© Miguel Ort√≠ Bord√°s said that Broseta had also been approached to become the PP candidate for the elections of President of the Generalitat Valenciana in 1995. Death On 15 February 1992 at 10:20 Broseta had just finished a class at the Faculty of Law of the University of Valencia and entered the gardens on the Avenida de Blasco Iba√±ez. He was on his way to the Banco de Valencia, where he worked as an advisor, to attend a meeting. He was then approached by a man and woman who ordered a student walking behind Broseta to get down on the ground. Broseta was subsequently killed by a single shot to the neck fired from a handgun. The two attackers then fled the scene in a Volkswagen Polo which they abandoned at the intersection of the Avenida de Arag√≥n and the Calle de Amadeo de Saboya, only 500 meters away from the site of the murder. Police attempted a controlled explosion of the car, fearing boobytraps. The car however exploded before they could do so, resulting in one police officer receiving minor injuries. Eyewitnesses reported that the attackers fled in another car and took the highway towards Barcelona. ETA claimed the attack. =Aftermath= The municipality of Valencia as well as the Generalitat Valenciana called for a minute of silence at 10:30 on the day after the incident. The Senate of Spain had earlier held a minute of silence. The municipality of Valencia later erected a column in Broseta's honor. The Profesor Manuel Broseta Foundation was founded on 16 July 1992, wishing to honor Broseta's memory. The foundation awards a Coexistence Prize every year. ETA commander Jos√© Luis Urrusolo Sistiaga, who was convicted to 449 years in prison for 16 murders, including the one on Broseta, was temporarily released in 2013. The release was criticized by Pablo Broseta, son of Manuel. Jos√© Luis √Ålvarez Santacristina was sentenced to thirty years imprisonment for the murder on Broseta. A couple of ETA members suspected of the crime were arrested in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico in February 2014, after being fugitives for 22 years. The prosecutor sought a prison sentence of 56 years against the couple. In March 2015 the Spanish Audienca Nacional found them not guilty.

During a racing career which lasted from 1977 until 1979 he ran sixteen times and won four races. As a two-year-old he showed moderate form in his first three races before being disqualified after passing the post first in the Horris Hill Stakes. In the following spring he won the Blue Riband Trial Stakes before recording a 28/1 upset victory in the 2000 Guineas. He was beaten in his remaining five races that year and won once in four starts as a four-year-old. He later stood as a breeding stallion in South Africa where he had some success as a sire of winners. Background Roland Gardens was a tall bay colt with no white markings bred by C. A. Ryan. He was from the ninth crop of foals sired by Derring-Do, a horse whose wins included the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in 1965 and whose other offspring included the 2000 Guineas winners High Top, and the St Leger Stakes winner Peleid. Roland Gardens dam, Katricia was a sprinter who went on the produce Anjuli, the dam of the Cartier Racing Award winner Kooyonga. As a yearling, Roland Gardens was offered for sale and bought for the modest sum of 3,200 guineas. The colt entered the ownership of John Hayter and was sent into training with Robert Armstrong at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =1977: two-year-old season= In 1977, Roland Gardens finished unplaced in his first two races and then won the Knole Stakes, a minor event over seven furlongs at Lingfield Park in September, beating Sunday Morning by two lengths. In October, the colt was moved up in class for the Group Three Horris Hill Stakes over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse. Ridden by Geoff Baxter, he appeared to relish the soft ground and moved up on the outside in the straight to take the lead from the more fancied runners Derrylin and Persian Bold. In the closing stages, he veered to the left, away from Baxter's whip bumping Derrylin who in turn collided with Persian Bold. He crossed the line half a length ahead of his two rivals who dead-heated for second place. After an inquiry by the racecourse stewards, Roland Gardens was disqualified and placed third. At the end of the year a quarter share in the colt was bought by Tim Sasse who had him moved to the stable of his son Duncan. =1978: three-year-old season= Roland Gardens began his three-year-old season in March, when he finished third to Camden Town and Roscoe Blake in the Roseberry Stakes over one mile at Stockton-on- Tees Racecourse. Three weeks later, in the Blue Riband Trial Stakes over eight and a half furlongs at Epsom Downs Racecourse, he took the lead at Tattenham Corner and held off the challenge of Royal Pinnacle to record his first Group race victory. On his next appearance, Roland Gardens was one of nineteen colts to contest the 171st running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley mile course at Newmarket Racecourse. Ridden by Frankie Durr, he started a 28/1 outsider in a race run on soft ground after several days of heavy rain. He was towards of the rear of the field as Tumbledownwind set a strong pace, before making steady progress in the centre of the wide Newmarket straight. He took the lead inside in the final furlong and accelerated away to win by one and half lengths from Remainder Man despite veering sharply to the right in the closing stages. Weth Nan and Tumbledownwind finished third and fourth with the favourite Try My Best finishing last. In the 199th running of the Derby Stakes at Epsom, Roland Gardens started at odds of 25/1, his pedigree having given him little prospect of staying the one and a half mile distance. He finished eighth of the twenty-five runners, nine lengths behind the winner Shirley Heights. He was sent to France later that month and finished fifth behind Carwhite in the Group One Prix d'Ispahan at Longchamp Racecourse. He was dropped in class for his remaining three races that year, but failed to win again. He finished fourth of the ten runners in the Prix Eug√®ne Adam, when he was asked to concede four pounds to the winner Gay Mecene, and then ran third (conceding thirteen pounds to the winner) behind Green Girl and Boldboy in the Kiveton Park Stakes over seven furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse. On his final appearance he was sent to Germany and finished eighth in the Grosser Kauthof- Preis in Cologne. =1979: four-year-old season= Roland Gardens remained his training as a four-year-old and ran four times. He recorded his only success in the Philip Cornes Trophy over seven furlongs at Leicester Racecourse in April, beating Skyliner by a length. On the best of his other appearances he finished second to Formidable at Haydock Park in May, after having struggled to obtain a clear run in the closing stages. Assessment In the Free Handicap for 1977, Roland Gardens was given a rating of 122, nine pounds behind the top-rated two-year-old Try My Best. He was rated fourteen pounds behind the same colt by the independent Timeform organisation, who rated him on 116. Timeform opinion of the colt's abilities was reflected in their comment felt the worst aspect of his run in the Horris Hill was that he had ruined his handicap rating for the following year. In the following year, he was rated 122 by Timeform, sixteen pounds below the top-rated horse Alleged and eight pounds behind the leading miler Homing. In the official International Classification he was given a rating of 81, fourteen pounds below the leading three-year-old Ile de Bourbon. Roland Gardens was again rated 122 by Timeform in 1979. In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Roland Gardens a \\"poor\\" winner of the 2000 Guineas. Duncan Sasse, in a letter to the Racing Post, expressed his view that the horse had been under-rated by Timeform, and that his correct rating should have been closer to 130. Sasse also pointed out that the colt was never able to show his best form on firm ground \\"as he turned out his front feet like Charlie Chaplin\\". Stud record Roland Gardens was retired from racing as a four-year-old and exported to become a breeding stallion in South Africa. The best of his offspring were two fillies Enchanted Garden and Roland's Song, both of which were named South African Horse of the Year. Enchanted Garden won the Natal Oaks and the South African Oaks and was named South African Horse of the Year 1986, while Roland's Song was the first female horse to exceed ZAR1m in prize money and South African Horse of the Year in 1989.

The book puts forth several arguments about a crisis facing Canadian politics and the institution of Parliament as a whole. It is backed by primary research conducted by Samara including \\"exit interviews\\" with 80 former Members of Parliament. Origin of the title Tragedy in the Commons is a variation of Garrett Hardin's \\"Tragedy of the Commons\\". In Hardin's argument, the commons as a whole suffers when individuals (in Hardin's case, farmers) behave selfishly and contrary to the good of the commons. As well, each person is demotivated from changing their ways, since they will be putting themselves at an economic disadvantage unless the other individuals agree to live by the same rules. Loat and MacMillan apply this as a metaphor to a \\"tragedy of the Commons\\", referring to the House of Commons. Primary sources The authors interviewed 80 former Members of Parliament from all major political parties, including the Liberal Party of Canada, Conservative Party of Canada, New Democratic Party of Canada, Bloc Quebecois, and the former Canadian Alliance, Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, and Reform Party of Canada. Those MPs came from a variety of professional backgrounds, geographic representation, and parliamentary experience. They included members who served in Opposition and cabinet, as party leaders and as backbench MPs. MPs interviewed included Paul Martin, David Anderson, Susan Barnes, Ed Broadbent, Claudette Bradshaw, Joseph Comuzzi, Guy Cote, Roy Cullen, Roger Gallaway, John Godfrey, Bill Graham, Keith Martin, Inky Mark, Jay Hill, Monte Solberg, Chuck Strahl, and Andrew Telegdi.Alison Loat and Michael MacMillan, Tragedy in the Commons: Former Members of Parliament Speak out About Canada's Failing Democracy (Toronto: Random House Canada, 2014), pg. 258. Tragedies of the Commons Loat and MacMillan argue that there are several unique yet related \\"tragedies\\" in the way the Canadian House of Commons currently operates. They are: # Candidates for election have to frequently be coerced and pushed into running for elected office. Because of this, elected MPs see themselves as \\"outsiders\\" of the political process, which results in a lack of ownership behind political institutions. # There is no universally agreed upon job description for Members of Parliament, leaving each person to figure it out for themselves. # The rules for being nominated as a political party's candidate in a riding are opaque and unclear, and frequently seen as being bent, ignored, or broken for star candidates. # The behaviour of MPs in the House of Commons, especially during Question Period, is childish and immature, and turns Canadians away from paying attention to political debates. # The work that gets done by MPs (bills being passed, government being held to account, and laws being scrutinized) is often done behind closed doors through committee and caucus meetings. # The increasing centralization of power in party leaders' offices and, when in government, the Prime Minister's Office. Loat and MacMillan note this started with Pierre Trudeau's government in the 1970s, and has only grown, including in Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government. # Because of the increased power in the leaders' offices, MPs are less likely to speak out against their leader or their political party, fearing that they will be demoted, kicked from caucus, unable to fully do their jobs, or will not be considered for cabinet positions or promotions. Loat and MacMillan note that the resulting tragedy is that Canadians stop paying attention to politics, refusing to engage their elected representatives and becoming increasingly sceptical about an MP's purpose, cost, or mandate.

Herbrand & Cie. for Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei (KES) for use on the Oslo Tramway of Norway. The units measured and featured a wooden superstructure with an indoor cabin and open platform bays. This gave a capacity for sixteen seated passengers. Each twin-axle unit was equipped with two motors. Eighteen of the units had a power output of , the other three . One unit was built by Norsk Elektrisk and Skabo. The first series of eleven trams and seven trailers were delivered for the company's opening of services on 2 March 1894. A further four trams were delivered in December and two more in 1897. The Norsk Elektrisk unit was bought in 1897 and the next year the three more powerful units were delivered. The last batch of trailers were bought in 1899. From 1910 the class was too small and the motor units were rebuilt to trailers. From 1917 they were again modified, this time merging two and two to make a larger trailer. The original trailers were in service until 1936, while the larger units remained until 1949. One motorized tram, in its original configuration, has been preserved. __TOC__ History Trailer no. 12 Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei was the second tram operator in Oslo when it was established in 1892. Its first task was the construction of the Briskeby Line and the Sk√∏yen Line. The company issued a tender for a complete electrical system, and six companies bid. KES selected Allgemeine Elektrizit√§ts Gesellschaft of Berlin as its supplier, not only for the trams, but also the power supply and overhead wire system. As part of the agreement AEG became a majority shareholder in KES. The system in Oslo was AEG's sixth system and was still subject to a trial and error approach. The trams were manufactured by P. Herbrand & Cie. of Cologne, with electrical components from AEG and undercarriages from Bergische Stahlindustri. The first series of eleven trams and seven trailers were delivered 1894 ahead of the official opening on 2 March 1894. The trams were numbered 1‚Äì11 and the trailers 12‚Äì18. The service proved more popular than the company had calculated and they therefore quickly ordered additional trams. Four units were delivered in December and numbered 19‚Äì22. The Skabo and Norske Eletrisk tram upon completion in 1895 Meanwhile the Norwegian electrical manufacturer Norsk Elektrisk intended to enter the tram market. They cooperated with Skabo to build a tram with the same specifications as the Class A, which was completed in 1895. They applied KES to conduct trial runs on their tramway, but KES had a clause in their contract with AEG which hindered from fraternizing with other manufacturers. NEBB was therefore forced to carry out tests on their own private tracks. However, KES was able to use the incident as leverage to get two additional trams delivered in 1896. They were headed to the Stra√üburg Tramway, but delays there allowed them to be relocated to Oslo and numbered 23‚Äì24. AEG's ownership was taken over by Norwegian investors in early 1897. KES immediately took contact with Norsk Elektrisk and requested that they test the tram. This was successful and the tram was bought in May. In September a race was organized by Norsk Elektrisk, where an AEG, NEA and Class 1898 tram of Holmenkolbanen raced up the Holmenkollen Line. The AEG tram won, reaching an average speed of with a power usage of 0.40 kilowatt per tonne. The Holmenkolbanen tram finished second, with an average speed of and 0.38 kW/t. The NEA unit finished last, with an average and 0.36 kW/t. Passengers embarking on tram no. 1 About this time all the units were rebuilt to control power through regulation of their resistance, which simplified operations. The last three trams were delivered in 1898 and already had resistance controlling. They were numbered 18‚Äì20. Unlike the others these had more powerful motors. In addition, KES took delivery of five trailers from Herbrand, numbered 41‚Äì45. A year later KES started taking delivery of the more modern Class U trams. In 1902 KES was forced to renumber all its trams to avoid confusion with its competitor Kristiania Sporveisselskap (KSS), and all trams were thus numbered from 101 and upwards. KES started taking delivery of the larger Class SS trams in 1909. With them the Class A was regarded as small and from 1910 the company started rebuilding them to trailers. The original trailers originally did not have any braking system, and with increasing speeds this became necessary to install from 1912 to 1914. At the same time the wheelbase was increased. The last motorized versions were taken out of service after the 1914 Jubilee Exhibition. No. 102 was never rebuilt and kept as a shunter. It was therefore possible to retire it as a heritage tram in 1919. It was then rebuilt to its original design at delivery and has since been transferred to the Norwegian Museum of Science and Technology. Rebuilt \\"long\\" trailer, no. 481 From 1917 the modified trailers were rebuilt. The carriages and undercarriages of two and two units were split and merged to make a larger unit, to create ten new trailers. These were numbered 356 through 365. They were at first used on the Lilleaker Line. KES was merged with KSS in 1924 to form Oslo Sporveier and the trailers were transferred to the new company. There the ex-motor trailers were renumbered 474 through 483. They continued in service until 1949, when the closing of the Korsvoll Line and the Rodel√∏kka Line created surplus rolling stock which could be retired. The trailers were scrapped from April 1951 to March 1952. The original trailers were little used after 1914, and were mostly utilized as a second trailer behind Class SS trams. Patronage fell from 1929, and in 1930 the first two were retired. The rest of the original trams were taken out of services from 1932 to 1936 as part of a rationalization program which involved retiring the smallest trailers. Specifications Trailer 17 The trams were built with very similar specifications, although there were a few variations. Painted green, all units measured , except units 118‚Äì120, which were long. All had an open bay platform with roofs at each end and a center cabin, with benches in the longitudinal direction. The cabin had five equally-sized windows on each side. The windows were later changed to three, in a long‚Äìshort‚Äìlong pattern. They had a wooden superstructure, but were clad on the inside with thin iron sheets. The trams would seat 16 passengers and 12 could stand, in addition to the motorman and conductor. All the units weighed 6 tonnes. They were twin-axle with a wheelbase of and a wheel diameter of . The trams originally had a skirt, but these were soon removed as they caused problems during operations. Tram 9 and trailer 15 All trams except no. 117‚Äì120 were delivered with two NB80 motors from AEG. These each had a power output of , giving a combined effort of . No. 118‚Äì120 were delivered with the more powerful VNB120, each with a power output of , for a total . These were both bipolar serial direct current motors organized as a compound motor. This allowed the speed to be regulated through the altering of the three spools between series and shunts, predefined in seven switches. In addition they had switches for reverse and emergency breaking. Power was collected through a trolley pole. All units were delivered with clamp brakes for operation and a dynamic braking through shorting for emergencies. One of the trams, no. 117, was a prototype built by Skabo with motors from Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri. It had the same dimensions and general design of the other units, but had two NEA1 motors, also rated at each. The first trailers had the same dimensions as the motorized vehicles. This consisted of a long cabin with eating for 16, although the lack of a motorman allowed for 18 standing passengers. The second series was long overall and had cabins. Unlike the first series which had longitudinal seating, the second series received two plus one abreast seating, with seats in opposing directions.

He was officially appointed as a teacher at the al-Azhar Mosque in 1946 by the Grand Shaykh of the Azhar at the time, though he had been teaching there without an official appointment for more than a decade, and continued to teach there until his death in 1399 AH/1979 CE.Dajani, Reassurance for the Seeker, p. 31. He therefore taught there for more than forty years, thirty-three of those as an officially appointed teacher. During the last decade or two of his life, he became the Imam of the Azhar Mosque and one of its most celebrated teachers and orators. He was also a spiritual guide and the founder of the Ja'fariyya tariqa. Origins Salih al-Ja'fari was a descendant of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad through his grandson al-Husayn. His ancestors came from the region of Luxor in Upper Egypt. His grandfather Salih, after whom he was named, was a Qur'an teacher who moved from Egypt to Dongola in Sudan and established a school for teaching the Qur'an. Salih al- Ja'fari was born and raised in Dongola.Dajani, Reassurance for the Seeker, p. 1. Life Salih al-Ja'fari was born in 1910 in the northern Sudanese city of Dongola. He learned the Qur'an and basics of Islamic scholarship at a young age at the hands of his grandfather's students. He moved to Cairo at the age of twenty in 1930 to study at the Azhar Mosque and lived the rest of his life there. As a student, his learning revolved heavily around the sciences of Hadith (the teachings of Muhammad) and Tafsir (the exegesis of the Qur'an). He studied with the most renowned scholars of his age, and was particularly close to a number of the most celebrated scholars of Hadith.Dajani, Reassurance for the Seeker, pp. 20-29. First as a student and then a teacher, he lived almost fifty years in the Azhar Mosque. For more than thirty years he lived in a specially constructed small room inside one of the teaching halls of the Azhar Mosque. He became the Imam of the Azhar Mosque and one of its orators and most celebrated teachers. He was most famous for his Friday lecture after the Friday prayer, and which were attended by hundreds, or according to some counts, more than a thousand people. His Friday lecture attracted both scholars and laymen. From his position as a great teacher in the Azhar and its imam, he attracted students from all over the Muslim world, many of whom became well known scholars, judges, Muftis, teachers, imams, and spiritual guides in different parts of the world.Dajani, Reassurance for the Seeker, pp. 31-8. Teachings As a teacher at the Azhar Mosque, Salih al-Ja'fari's teachings revolved around the Qur'an, Hadith, spirituality, and jurisprudence. His lessons began as commentaries and explications of verses from the Qur'an but would also focus heavily on spirituality. The main themes of his lessons were the importance of following the teachings of the Qur'an, loving Muhammad, and being learned in the religion. He also discussed jurisprudence according to the four schools of thought in Sunni Islam, and was himself affiliated with the Maliki School, though he did not restrict himself to it.Dajani, Reassurance for the Seeker, p. 33. He had the ability to practice Ijtihad to deal with contemporary issues.Dajani, Reassurance for the Seeker, pp. xi-xxi. Among his main concerns was to deal with the rise of Communism and secularism at the time, as well as to preserve the unity of Sunni Muslims as some modern movements that called for change or reform caused division and debate.Dajani, Reassurance for the Seeker, p. xi; pp. 32-3. He also dedicated much time to finding the works of the scholar and revivalist Ahmad ibn Idris al-Fasi, editing them, and publishing them. These teachings focused on: 1) The revivification of the Sunna or practice of Muhammad.Dajani, Reassurance for the Seeker, pp. 6-7, 14.Al-Sanusi, al-Musalsalat al-Ashr, p. 13. 2) The moral and spiritual education of the individual Muslim. Ibn Idris had emphasized the importance of piety, prayer, religious learning (especially the Prophetic traditions), and close following of Muhammad's example.Thomassen and Radtke, The Letters of Ahmad ibn Idris, p. 2.Dajani, Reassurance for the Seeker, p. 7. Tariqa Al-Ja'fari followed the spiritual teachings and path of Ahmad ibn Idris al-Fasi, or the Tariqa Muhammadiyya. This was not a Tariqa in the sense of an organized Sufi order, but rather a spiritual method, consisting of a set of teachings and litanies, aimed at nurturing the spiritual link between the disciple and Muhammad directly. It was sometimes known as the Idrisiyya or Ahmadiyya (not be to confused with the Ahmadiyya of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad) after Ibn Idris himself, and sometimes as the Muhammadiyya after Muhammad. It became known as the Ahmadiyya Muhammadiyya in full.Ahmad ibn Idris al-Fasi Al-Ja'fari took the litanies and teachings of this path from Shaykh Muhammad al-Sharif, the grandson of Ahmad ibn Idris, who taught in Dongola. Al-Ja'fari became a spiritual guide in this path, which he helped spread and popularize, attracting thousands of students from Egypt and abroad. He wrote hundreds of poems on spiritual guidance and on love of - and in praise of - Muhammad, as well as supplications to God. Through these poems and the production of his own set of litanies, he prepared the way for the establishment of his own branch of the Ahmadiyya Muhammadiyya. He summarized his path in those lines of poetry: My path is the Qur'an, knowledge and piety, and praise for the Messenger of God, the one who abolishes misguidance.Dajani, Reassurance for the Seeker, p. 47. After his passing, his son Shaykh Abd al-Ghani al-Ja'fari collected and published the poems and litanies of his father, and officially founded the Ja'fariyya Tariqa, or the Ja'fariyya Ahmadiyya Muhammadiyya in full. This tariqa has more than seventy centers throughout Egypt, as well as some in Sudan, Libya, and Malaysia.Dajani, Reassurance for the Seeker, pp. 42-9. Its followers also hold regular gatherings of Remembrance of God or Dhikr in other places such as the UK and Saudi Arabia. The Tariqa is active in education and social work and provides many education, medical and social services for the local communities around its centers.Dajani, Reassurance for the Seeker, pp. 53-5. Works Al-Ja'fari wrote more than fifteen works on various Islamic sciences such as Sufism, Sunni Creed, Hadith and Jurisprudence, and edited many others. These works include his poetry (collected and published in twelve volumes) and his collections of devotional prayers and litanies.Dajani, Reassurance for the Seeker, pp. 55-7.

Sections AB and ED are shown in red, and the remaining segments are shown in color with a dot on the point of centrosymmetry. A tessellation of the above prototile meeting the Conway Criterion. In the mathematical theory of tessellations, the Conway criterion, named for the English mathematician John Horton Conway, is a fast way to identify many prototiles that tile the plane; it consists of the following requirements:Will It Tile? Try the Conway Criterion! by Doris Schattschneider Mathematics Magazine Vol. 53, No. 4 (Sep., 1980), pp. 224-233 The tile must be a closed topological disk with six consecutive points A, B, C, D, E, and F on the boundary such that: * the boundary part from A to B is congruent by translation to the boundary part from E to D * each of the boundary parts BC, CD, EF, and FA is centrosymmetric‚Äîthat is, each one is congruent to itself when rotated by 180-degrees around its midpoint * some of the six points may coincide but at least three of them must be distinct.Periodic Tiling: Polygons in General Any prototile satisfying Conway's criterion admits a periodic tiling of the plane‚Äîand does so using only translation and 180-degree rotations. The Conway criterion is a sufficient condition to prove that a prototile tiles the plane but not a necessary one; there are tiles that fail the criterion and still tile the plane. Examples hexagonal tiling with centrosymmetric hexagons The two nonominoes not satisfying the Conway criterion but able to tile the plane In its simplest form the criterion states that any hexagon whose opposite sides are parallel and congruent (that is, any hexagonal parallelogon) will tessellate the plane by translation.Polyominoes: A Guide to Puzzles and Problems in Tiling, by George Martin, Mathematical Association of America, Washington, DC, 1991, p. 152, But when some of the points coincide, the criterion can apply to other polygons and even to shapes with curved perimeters.The five types of Conway Criterion polygon tile , PDF file The Conway criterion is sufficient, but not necessary, for a shape to tile the plane. For each polyomino up to order 8 that can tile the plane at all, either the polyomino satisfies the Conway criterion or else two copies of the polyomino can be combined to form a polyform patch that satisfies the criterion. The same is true of every tiling nonomino, except for the two tiling nonominoes on the right.

The malware targets computers using operating systems based on Microsoft Windows. According to US officials, over 500,000 computer systems have been infected worldwide with the software. In 2014, the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrested hundreds of people who had Blackshade in their computer. Before the FBI crackdown, Blackshades was sold for US$40 on Hack Forums, and reportedly generated US$350,000 in sales.  Functionality  Blackshades infects computer systems by downloading onto a victim's computer when the victim accesses a malicious webpage (sometimes downloading onto the victim's computer without the victim's knowledge, known as a drive-by download) or through external storage devices, such as USB flash drives. Blackshades has the ability to infect and hack multiple computers from the release of a bait that the hacker can make use of, an improved version of blackshades was released shortly after the original release of the primary version, when hacking organizations like OffensiveEncode and Cyber- Sec, decided to develop special features for coupling to the software such as undetectability, DDoS / TCP Flood, and backdoor persistence features. Blackshades can reportedly be used remotely to access an infected computer without authorization. Blackshades allows hackers to perform many actions on an infected computer remotely without authorization, including the ability to: * Access and modify files on the victim's computer. * Log keystrokes on the victim's computer. * Access to the webcam of the victim. * Include the victim's computer in a botnet, which allows the attacker to perform denial-of- service attacks with the victim's computer, and usually along with other infected computers. * Download and execute files on the victim's computer. * Use the victim's computer as a proxy server. Blackshades reportedly can be used by computer hackers with little experience or by script kiddies, hackers that use programs developed by others to attack computer systems. Blackshades can also act as ransomware. Hackers using Blackshades can restrict access to the victim's computer and demand a ransom paid to the hacker in order for the restriction to be lifted.  Detection and removal  Many antivirus programs can successfully detect and remove Blackshades, however hackers using the Blackshades software usually avoid detection of Blackshades infections by using software that obfuscates the Blackshades binary to avoid detection by antivirus programs, which the Blackshades organization also sold along with the Blackshades software.  Blackshades in the media  In 2012, Citizen Lab and EFF reported on the use of Blackshades to target opposition forces in Syria.; In 2015, Stefan Rigo from Leeds was given a 40-week suspended sentence for using BlackShades against 14 people, 7 of whom he knew personally. It is reported he paid for the software using his ex-girlfriend's payment card.;  FBI crackdown  In 2012, the FBI ran a sting operation called \\"Operation Card Shop\\", which led to 24 arrests of hackers in eight countries. One of those arrested was Michael Hogue (also known as xVisceral in online hacking communities). Hogue, a co-creator of Blackshades, was arrested and indicted on charges under , more commonly known as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. He was sentenced to five years of probation, 20 years suspended prison sentence. In 2014, the FBI coordinated a worldwide operation to combat the use of the malware, leading to the arrest of almost one hundred people in nineteen countries. On May 19, charges were laid in the United States against five individuals: two men identified as developers of Blackshades and three other men who sold the software or used it to infiltrate other people's computers. Exactly 359 searches were conducted and more than 1,100 electronic devices have been seized as part of the operation. According to the FBI, over 500,000 computers in more than 100 countries were infected by the malware. Blackshades sold typically for US$40, and reportedly generated US$350,000 in sales.

Early life  Dangoor was born in Baghdad in 1914, the second of six siblings. His father, Eliahou Dangoor (1883‚Äì1976), was the world's largest printer of Arabic books, and his grandfather Hakham Ezra Reuben Dangoor was the Chief Rabbi of Baghdad. In the 1930s, Dangoor made the five-day journey from Baghdad to London, at the age of 17, in order to enroll in an engineering degree at the University of London. After graduating he returned to Iraq where he was conscripted into the army and became an officer. It was during his army training that he met his future business partner Ahmed Safwat. Career  Initially on leaving the army he had hoped to become an engineer on the railways, but due to restrictions imposed upon Jews this was not possible, so he and Ahmed, a Muslim, decided to go into business together, setting up Eastern Industries in 1949. Their first contract was to supply new windows to all Iraqi government buildings, and soon their portfolio grew to include property development and letting. In 1950, Eastern industries secured the first contract to bottle Coca-Cola in Iraq. Alongside Eastern Industries, Dangoor also ran factories producing matches and furniture. With the founding of the State of Israel and the resulting conflict between Israel and the Arab states, the situation for Jews in the country worsened and in 1959 Dangoor took the difficult decision to take his family out. He continued travelling back and forth for business until 1963, when he decided that the worsening political situation made it too risky for him to return. As a result of laws specific to Jews, he lost his Iraqi citizenship, and his property and business interests were taken by the government. He was eventually permitted to settle in the UK where he set about rebuilding his life, setting up a property business that his four sons went on to join. Personal life In November 1947, Dangoor married his cousin, Ren√©e Dangoor (who had been crowned Miss Iraq earlier that year). They went on to have four sons. Philanthropy  In order to preserve the heritage of the community he had left behind, soon after settling in the UK, he founded a community centre in West Kensington for new Iraqi Jewish immigrants, and in 1971 began editing and publishing The Scribe ‚Äì Journal of Babylonian Jewry, with 4000 subscribers in 25 countries which continued to be published for 35 years. In 1970, he revived the title of Exilarch ‚Äì an ancient title held by the supreme leader of all the Jewish communities in Babylonia, up until the 13th Century. In 2003, he demanded ¬£12 billion ($20 billion) from Iraq's leaders as compensation for what the Iraqi- Jewish community had lost in Iraq after the Second World War. As his business in the UK grew, he wanted to give back to the country that had taken him in. In 1980 he set up the Exilarch's Foundation, a charity that has made numerous donations to causes relating to education and health. In 2004, he created the Dangoor Scholarships to help one thousand undergraduate students who had no family history of further education, at the 1994 Group of universities. In 2008 Dangoor initiated \\"The Sir Naim Dangoor Program for Universal Monotheism\\" at Bar Ilan University.The main goal of the program was to cultivate real peace and understanding through truth, ethics, and action of the broad common ground shared by the major monotheistic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Later, the program‚Äôs goal expended and were defined as to open horizons to learn more about other religions, and to serve as a bridge to East Asian beliefs and traditions. After 10 fruitful years of activity the program developed into a cultural diplomacy and educational center: \\"The Sir Naim Dangoor Centre for Universal monotheism\\". The Dangoor Centre (◊û◊®◊õ◊ñ ◊ì◊†◊í◊ï◊®) is the direct continuation of the Dangoor Program which was active from 2008-2018. The Centre began its official activities during the 2019 academic school year at Bar-Ilan University. The primary aim of the Sir Naim Dangoor Centre for Universal Monotheism (◊û◊®◊õ◊ñ ◊ì◊™-◊¢◊ï◊ú◊ù ◊¢‚Äù◊© ◊°◊® ◊†◊¢◊ô◊ù ◊ì◊†◊í◊ï◊®) is to return the humanities to its place as a connector between worlds and to act as an intercultural mediator.The Centre operations focus on innovation, publication, development and distribution of knowledge and insights on issues of universal cultural interest, based on tolerance, mutual respect, and a comprehensive and respectful intellectual worldview. It operates as an inter-religious and inter-cultural mediator in a variety of fields of knowledge and interest shared by all peoples and cultures, heritages and traditions from the West and East. https://dangoorcentre.com/ In 2009, he created the Eliahou Dangoor Scholarships, in honour of his father. These were awarded to four thousand undergraduate students, with limited means, studying STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects. In the same year Dangoor was made honorary President for the Association of Jewish Academics from Iraq. The Exilarch's Foundation also sponsors the Westminster Academy in West London, whose pupils hail from over 60 countries, many in the Middle East. Dangoor's family have been closely involved with the running of the school and have seen it go from being issued with an Ofsted 'Notice to Improve' in 2009, to being rated as 'Outstanding' in 2013. Since the Academy opened the number of students achieving five A*-C GCSE grades including both English and Maths has increased from 17% to 70% in 2014. Dangoor also donated a significant amount to Cancer Research UK to support their website, in memory of his late wife Ren√©e, who died from breast cancer in 2008. At Bar-Ilan University in Israel, Dangoor set up the Dangoor Centre for Personalised Medicine in the Galilee, which partners with hospitals to analyse the genetic makeup of individual patients, enabling doctors to implement the most effective treatments. In 2014 he made the largest gift to the Royal Society of Medicine in its history. The donation is being used to help support young people from disadvantaged backgrounds who would like to pursue a career in medicine, as well as supporting the society's post-graduate education provision. Dangoor was also the largest private individual donor to the Francis Crick Institute in London, Europe's largest biomedical research centre. Dangoor Walk, a pathway that runs beside the Francis Crick Institute and links Midland Road with Ossulton Street, is named after him. Through his foundation Dangoor promoted the idea of 'Universal Monotheism' a concept that he believes can bring about unity and create a framework for a global religious ethic. He has sponsored the setting up of a centre for Universal Monotheism at Bar-Ilan University from which he received an honorary doctorate in 2006. He made contributions to the University of Nanjing in China, and had a particular interest in China because his late wife Ren√©e was born and grew up in Shanghai. In Nanjing he funded scholarships for the university's Jewish Studies Institute and sponsored an international symposium on monotheism, attended by delegates from all over China, the US, Australia and Israel. In 2011 he was made a consultant professor of the University of Nanjing in recognition of his contributions. Honours  He received an OBE in 2006, a CBE in the 2012 New Year Honours List, and was made a Knight Bachelor in the Queen's 2015 Birthday Honours list. He became the second-oldest person to be knighted, and the oldest to be knighted for the first time ‚Äì Robert Mayer was 101 when he was made a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order, but he had already been made a Knight Bachelor at the age of 60. In 2012 Dangoor was made a fellow of Birkbeck College, part of the University of London. This was in addition to his honorary fellowship of the Royal Albert Hall of Arts and Sciences, awarded in 2007. In April 2015, to mark his birthday, Coca-Cola published a piece on the first Coca-Cola bottler of Iraq sharing a centenary with the iconic Coca-Cola bottle.

Background In September 1812, Russian troops of General Steinheil entered Mitau, Gross Eckau and Bauska without a fight. However, they were spread out and vulnerable to enemy counterattacks. The Prussian command deployed its forces to defend the artillery stationed at the Bauska Castle and sent small squads to the ford across the river Lielupe. The battle On September 29, the Prussians launched a counterattack against the advancing Russian forces and attacked their vanguard at 5 pm. The struggle lasted until late at night and pushed the Russian troops back. On the same night, Ludwig von Wartenburg sent forces under the command of Friedrich Kleist against the troops of Alexander Belgard, which were chasing a retreating Prussian squad on the left bank of the Lielupe. The resulting battle was fought in darkness and involved only infantry units.

The pyramids were built in northern Nigeria in cities such as Kano, where groundnut production was a key part of the economy. They were viewed as both a tourist attraction and a symbol of wealth. In the 1960s and 70s, as production in Nigeria shifted from agriculture to oil, the groundnut pyramids disappeared. Recently, the Nigerian government has made efforts to revive the groundnut industry and rebuild the pyramids. History Groundnut pyramids were the invention of Alhassan Dantata, a prominent nut trader. Dantata came to Kano in 1919 and within five years was one of the most successful businessmen, supplying the Royal Niger Company (RNC) with most of their groundnuts. Dantata's company kept their groundnuts at a facility in Kofar Nassarawa, and they stacked the bags in the shape of a pyramid before they were shipped. One groundnut pyramid could be made from as much as 15,000 full groundnut bags. A journalist who visited a former groundnut pyramid site in Kano reported that the land was now a football field. Groundnut pyramids were built all across northern Nigeria, in cities like Kofar Mazugal, Brigade, Bebeji, Malam Madori and Dawakin Kudu. The pyramids became synonymous with Nigeria's agriculture wealth; a postage stamp even featured a groundnut pyramid. However, as groundnut production declined in the 1970s and 80s the groundnut pyramids disappeared and were replaced with buildings. Modern efforts On February 24, 2014, Dr. Akimwumi Adesina, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development launched a groundnut value chain project. This project is a joint venture between the Federal Government (FG) of Nigeria and the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT). Their aim is twofold: to increase Nigeria's groundnut production and rebuild the groundnut pyramids. President Goodluck Jonathan reiterated the government's desire to rebuild the pyramids in a bridge dedication speech in March 2015.

Course North Branch Mahantango Creek begins in West Perry Township, Snyder County, on Shade Mountain in Bald Eagle State Forest. It flows south-southeast off Shade Mountain and then turns east and flows in Heister Valley between Chestnut Ridge and Lime Ridge. It receives a number of small and unnamed tributaries from the north and after several miles exits West Perry Township. Upon leaving West Perry Township, the creek enters Perry Township and continues flowing east for a short distance. It then reaches the community of Mount Pleasant Mills and turns southeast. The creek crosses Pennsylvania Route 35 and begins paralleling Pennsylvania Route 104, turning south shortly thereafter. It passes Potato Valley, where an unnamed tributary enters it from the west and then passes Buckwheat Valley (where another unnamed tributary enters it from the west) and the community of Shadle. It continues south, passing the Long Woods and receiving a tributary from Trout Valley. The creek then reaches Aline Creek and the community of Aline. A short distance downstream, it reaches the border between Perry Township and Chapman Township. The creek then flows along the border for a few miles, running parallel to Pennsylvania State Game Lands #194.

The ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus in North Branch Mahantango Creek is 18 to 1, making phosphorus a limiting nutrient. There is no point-source pollution in the impaired part of the watershed. Geology, geography, and climate In the impaired section of the watershed of North Branch Mahantango Creek, 38% of the surface rock is sandstone, 25% is carbonate, 24% is shale, and 12% is interbedded sedimentary rock. In an unimpaired portion of the watershed, 50% of the surface rock is sandstone, 34% is interbedded sedimentary rock, 10% is shale, and 6% is carbonate. Sandstone lies under the northern part of the North Branch Mahantango Creek watershed's impaired section. South of the sandstone is shale. In the southern part of this section of the watershed, there is interbedded sedimentary rock and carbonate rock. A nearby unimpaired part of the watershed has a similar arrangement of rock. The Mahantango Formation can be found in the watershed of North Branch Mahantango Creek and is named for the creek. Most of the North Branch Mahantango Creek watershed is mountainous, with spurs and ridges. Its channel is sinuous and runs through rock formations consisting of limestone, sandstone, and shale. North Branch Mahantango Creek is a limestone stream. The annual precipitation in the watershed of North Branch Mahantango Creek is , although it ranged from in the early 1920s. The wettest month is June, when of precipitation falls. The driest month is February, when falls. The total annual runoff is and the annual streamflow is . Streamflow occurs more in March than in any other month (). The months with the least streamflow are July, August, and September, with of streamflow each. The creek's temperature is upstream of Mount Pleasant Mills. Watershed The watershed of North Branch Mahantango Creek has an area of approximately 37 square miles. According to the Susquehanna River Basin Commission, the creek's watershed is one of the highest-quality watersheds in the lower Susquehanna River watershed. The most common land use in the impaired part of the watershed of North Branch Mahantango Creek is deciduous forest, which makes up 55.5% of the area. Cropland makes up 21.1% of this part of the watershed and hay and pastures make up 17.3% of it. 3.7% is mixed forest, and 2.5% is coniferous forest. 0.5% of the land (a quarry) is considered \\"high-intensity development\\" by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. 0.2% of the land is considered \\"low-intensity development\\" by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. An unimpaired portion of the creek's watershed includes of 58.5% deciduous forest, 21.1% cropland, 11.9% hay and pasture, 4.2% coniferous forest, and 3.2% mixed forest.

Nearly all of the northern part of the impaired portion of the watershed of North Branch Mahantango Creek is forested and most of the southern part is agricultural or developed. A nearby unimpaired part of the creek's watershed has the same layout. Both parts of the watershed have wetlands. The elevation of North Branch Mahantango Creek's mouth is above sea level. Its elevation decreases at a rate of per mile as it flows from its source to its mouth. History In the early 1920s, agriculture was the main industry in the watershed of West Branch Mahantango Creek. The creek also powered several small gristmills at this time. The Aline Covered Bridge was built over North Branch Mahantango Creek in 1884. It is a burr truss bridge that is long. Mahantango Creek's name comes from the Delaware word mahantongo, meaning \\"where we had plenty to eat\\". Biology North Branch Mahantango Creek is stocked with trout. Moderate numbers of brown trout and some young of the year inhabit it. Herds of livestock can freely access the creek. It lacks a protected riparian buffer. In his book Trout Unlimited's Guide to Pennsylvania Limestone Streams, A. Joseph Armstrong said that North Branch Mahantango Creek \\"doesn't rival the Little Lehigh or Fishing Creek, but it is an honest-to-goodness limestone stream\\" and that it \\"is not an important stream, but in this relatively barren part of the Commonwealth it is worth keeping in mind if you can't fish elsewhere.\\" See also *West Branch Mahantango Creek, the other tributary of Mahantango Creek *List of rivers of Pennsylvania References Category:Rivers of Snyder County, Pennsylvania Category:Rivers of Pennsylvania Category:Tributaries of the Susquehanna River ","title":"North Branch Mahantango Creek"},{"id":"42806913","text":"Lady Augusta Gordon (n√©e FitzClarence; 17 November 1803 ‚Äì 8 December 1865) was a British noblewoman. Born the fourth illegitimate daughter of William IV of the United Kingdom (then Duke of Clarence) by his long-time mistress Dorothea Jordan, she grew up at their Bushy House residence in Teddington. Augusta had four sisters and five brothers all surnamed FitzClarence. Soon after their father became monarch, the FitzClarence children were raised to the ranks of younger children of a marquess. In 1827, Augusta married the Hon. John Kennedy-Erskine, a younger son of the 13th Earl of Cassilis. They had three children before he died in 1831. Five years later, she married Lord Frederick Gordon, the third son of the 9th Marquess of Huntly. After the death of her sister Sophia in 1837, Augusta was appointed State Housekeeper of Kensington Palace by her father. She was the mother of the novelist Wilhelmina FitzClarence, Countess of Munster. Family and early life Augusta FitzClarence was born at Bushy House, Teddington on 17 November 1803 as the fourth daughter of Prince William, Duke of Clarence by his long-time mistress, the famous comic actress Dorothea Jordan. Dorothea was the most successful actress of her day and continued to act on the stage during their relationship. Augusta had nine siblings from the relationship, four sisters and five brothers all surnamed FitzClarence. While circumstances prevented the couple from ever marrying, for twenty years William and Dorothea enjoyed domestic stability and were devoted to their children. In 1797, they moved from Clarence Lodge to Bushy House, residing at the Teddington residence until 1807. Augusta was born there. Augusta's daughter Wilhelmina would later write that Bushy was \\"a happy and beloved home\\" until it \\"came to end\\" upon Prince William's marriage to Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen in 1818. He and Dorothea had parted ways in December 1811 under a deed of separation, the debt-ridden duke desiring to secure a rich wife. Dorothea was granted ¬£4,400 and the task of caring for their daughters; William was permitted to visit them until they turned thirteen. She left Bushy in January 1812. The money was not enough to cover her debts, however. Dorothea continued to act on the stage after his leaving. In 1815, she moved from London to Boulogne, France to evade her creditors. On 5 July 1816, she died there alone. She had suffered from ill health and possessed little money, having squandered the bulk of it on her eldest daughter Frances (fathered by another man). Augusta's stepmother, Adelaide, was gentle and loving to the FitzClarence children. In 1818, Augusta and her siblings were granted a pension of ¬£500, and Augusta was given her own version of the Royal Arms featuring a \\"baton sinister azure charged with an anchor between two roses or\\". In 1819, Baron Franz Ludwig von Bibra, a German man with knowledge of the classics and English, was engaged to tutor the two youngest FitzClarence daughters. He left in 1822 upon the completion of their education. In June 1830, the Duke of Clarence succeeded his brother George IV as King William IV. The following year, he made his eldest son George Earl of Munster, and had his issue by Jordan raised to the ranks of younger children of a marquess. With their father now monarch, the FitzClarences frequently attended court but their presence angered the Duchess of Kent, who felt that the FitzClarences would be a corrupting influence on her daughter Princess Victoria. King William loved his children and was aggrieved at their treatment at the hands of the Duchess, who would leave the room whenever they entered. Marriage to Kennedy-Erskine On 5 July 1827, Augusta married the Hon. John Kennedy-Erskine, a younger son of the 13th Earl of Cassilis. Kennedy-Erskine served as a captain with the 16th Lancers, and was made an equerry to King William in 1830. They had three children: * William Henry Kennedy-Erskine (1 July 1828 ‚Äì 5 September 1870); married Catherine Jones in 1862 and had issue including the Scottish writer Violet Jacob * Wilhelmina \\"Mina\\" Kennedy-Erskine (27 June 1830 ‚Äì 9 October 1906); married William FitzClarence, 2nd Earl of Munster in 1855 and had issue * Augusta Anne Millicent Kennedy-Erskine (11 May 1831 ‚Äì 11 February 1895); married James Hay Erskine Wemyss in 1855 and had issue Augusta enjoyed botany and needlework. John inherited his maternal grandfather's estate of Dun in Forfarshire, and as its ch√¢telaine, Augusta was featured in Hugh Massingberd's Great Houses of Scotland. John died on 6 March 1831. Her youngest daughter Millicent was born posthumously, as John died several months before her birth. In an act considered scandalous King William, still early in his reign, publicly mourned the death of his son-in-law. Now widowed, Lady Augusta and her children lived in a \\"charming brickhouse\\" at Railshead on the River Thames. King William often visited his daughter and grandchildren there, at one point coming to comfort Augusta when her young daughter Wilhelmina fell ill with a fever. They would often visit the king at Windsor Castle as well. They also had a house in Brighton. Marriage to Gordon On 24 August 1836, Lady Augusta married Lord Frederick Gordon, the third son of George Gordon, 9th Marquess of Huntly. Gordon was a professional sailor, and would become Admiral of the Navy in 1868. He and Augusta had no surviving children together. Their Railshead residence had been situated next to a house owned by John's parents, who were angered by Augusta's second marriage and forced Augusta and Frederick to leave. Augusta turned to her father for help, and he granted her apartments in Kensington Palace and the position of State Housekeeper (replacing her recently deceased sister Sophia). They lived there for many years. In 1847, they embarked on a three-year trip to the continent, visiting Germany, France, and Italy. In 1850, they returned to Kensington Palace and Augusta's daughters came out in society. Both daughters married in 1855 in a double wedding, Wilhelmina to the 2nd Earl of Munster and Millicent to James Hay Erskine Wemyss. Augusta died in 1865. Her husband survived Augusta by twelve years.

History Very little documentation of the work exists, but it is known that it was painted circa 1912-1913, during the artist's Cubo-Futurist phase. In 1941, it was given to the Yale University Art Gallery by the Collection Soci√©t√© Anonyme. Description The artwork is typical of Malevich's other paintings, in that the subject matter is of a person generally overlooked by society. The painting depicts a moustached man in a suit and hat manually grinding a knife on a knife sharpener, or a grinding wheel. The human is in a constant state of movement; the person is either repeatedly inspecting his progress on the knife, and, dismayed by the fact that it is not yet sharp enough, once more starts busily peddling the machine, is simply applying the blade to the machine in a fragmentary way, as though he were a novice, or is only shown carefully putting the blade to the sharpener in slow motion. Shavings of metal are suggested by chunks of green around the grinder's face and hands. Behind him on the left are some vases atop shelves and a table and possibly one or two metal pipes, whilst on the right are unclear grey objects (possibly buildings), implying that the person is a professional knife grinder in their workshop; a small staircase may also be observed at the bottom right corner. The colours blue, green and silver are dominant in the painting; other colours used are orange, yellow, brown and crimson. The metallic palette was probably chosen to emphasise the violent manner in which the shavings and knife glitter.

Coexistence theory is a framework to understand how competitor traits can maintain species diversity and stave-off competitive exclusion even among similar species living in ecologically similar environments. Coexistence theory explains the stable coexistence of species as an interaction between two opposing forces: fitness differences between species, which should drive the best-adapted species to exclude others within a particular ecological niche, and stabilizing mechanisms, which maintains diversity via niche differentiation. For many species to be stabilized in a community, population growth must be negative density-dependent, i.e. all participating species have a tendency to increase in density as their populations decline. In such communities, any species that becomes rare will experience positive growth, pushing its population to recover and making local extinction unlikely. As the population of one species declines, individuals of that species tend to compete predominantly with individuals of other species. Thus, the tendency of a population to recover as it declines in density reflects reduced intraspecific competition (within-species) relative to interspecific competition (between-species), the signature of niche differentiation (see Lotka-Volterra competition). Types of coexistence mechanisms Two qualitatively different processes can help species to coexist: a reduction in average fitness between species or an increase in niche differentiation between species. These two factors have been termed equalizing and stabilizing mechanisms, respectively. #Equalizing mechanisms reduce fitness differences between species, or relative competitive ability in the absence of niche differentiation. As its name implies, it works by making similar species more equal in their competitive ability. For example, when multiple species compete for the same resource, competitive ability is determined by the minimum level of resources a species needs to maintain itself (known as an R*, or equilibrium resource density). Thus, the species with the lowest R* is the best competitor and excludes all other species in the absence of any niche differentiation. Any factor that reduces R*s between species (like increased harvest of the dominant competitor) is classified as an equalizing mechanism. For species to coexist, fitness differences must be overcome by stabilizing mechanisms. #Stabilizing mechanisms promote coexistence by concentrating intraspecific competition relative to interspecific competition. There are large number of named stabilizing mechanisms including classical hypotheses of species coexistence. Resource partitioning, whereby interspecific competition is reduced because species compete primarily through different resources, is a stabilizing mechanism. Similarly, if species are differently affected by environmental variation (e.g., soil type, rainfall timing, etc.), this can create a stabilizing mechanism (see the storage effect). Stabilizing mechanisms increase the low-density growth rate of all species. A general way of measuring the effect of stabilizing mechanisms is by calculating the growth rate of species i in a community as \\\\hat{r_i} = b_i ( k_i - \\\\hat{k} + A ) where: :*\\\\hat{r_i} is the long-term average growth rate of the species i when at low density. Because species are limited from growing indefinitely, viable populations have an average long-term growth rate of zero. Therefore, species at low-density can increase in abundance when their long-term average growth rate is positive. :*b_i is a species-specific factor that reflects how quickly species i responds to a change in competition. For example, species with faster generation times may respond more quickly to a change in resource density than longer lived species. In an extreme scenario, if ants and elephants were to compete for the same resources, elephant population sizes would change much more slowly to changes in resource density than would ant populations. :*k_i - \\\\hat{k} is the difference between the fitness of species i when compared to the average fitness of the community excluding species i. In the absence of any stabilizing mechanisms, species i will only have a positive growth rate if its fitness is above its average competitor, i.e. where this value is greater than zero. :*A measures the effect of all stabilizing mechanisms acting within this community. = Example calculation: Species competing for resource = In 2008 Chesson and Kuang showed how to calculate fitness differences and stabilizing mechanisms when species compete for shared resources and competitors. Each species j captures resource type l at a species-specific rate, cjl. Each unit of resource captured contributes to species growth by value vl. Each consumer requires resources for the metabolic maintenance at rate Œºi. In conjunction, consumer growth is decreased by attack from predators. Each predator species m attacks species j at rate ajm. Given predation and resource capture, the density of species i, Ni, grows at rate \\\\frac{1}{N_j}\\\\frac{dN_j}{dt} = \\\\sum_l c_{jl}v_lR_l - \\\\sum_m a_{jm}P_m - \\\\mu_j where l sums over resource types and m sums over all predator species. Each resource type exhibits logistic growth with intrinsic rate of increase, rRl, and carrying capacity, KRl = 1/Œ±Rl, such that growth rate of resource l is \\\\frac{1}{R_l}\\\\frac{dR_l}{dt} = r^R_l \\\\left( 1-\\\\alpha^R_lR_l \\\\right) - \\\\sum_jc_{jl}N_j. Similarly, each predator species m exhibits logistic growth in the absence of the prey of interest with intrinsic growth rate rPm and carrying capacity KPm = 1/Œ±Pm. The growth rate of a predator species is also increased by consuming prey species where again the attack rate of predator species m on prey j is ajm. Each unit of prey has a value to predator growth rate of w. Given these two sources of predator growth, the density of predator m, Pm, has a per-capita growth rate \\\\frac{1}{P_m}\\\\frac{dP_m}{dt}=r^P_m(1-\\\\alpha^P_mP_m) + \\\\sum_j wN_ja_{jm} where the summation terms is contributions to growth from consumption over all j focal species. The system of equations describes a model of trophic interactions between three sets of species: focal species, their resources, and their predators. Given this model, the average fitness of a species j is k_j = \\\\frac{1}{s_j}\\\\left(\\\\sum_{l=1} c_{jl} v_l K^R_l - \\\\sum_m a_{jm}K^P_m - \\\\mu_i \\\\right) where the sensitivity to competition and predation is s_j = \\\\sqrt{\\\\left( \\\\sum_l \\\\frac{c^2_{jl}v_lK_l^R}{r^R_l} + \\\\sum_m \\\\frac{a^2_{jm}wK^P_m}{r^P_m} \\\\right)}. The average fitness of a species takes into account growth based on resource capture and predation as well as how much resource and predator densities change from interactions with the focal species. The amount of niche overlap between two competitors i and j is \\\\rho = \\\\left(\\\\sum_l \\\\frac{c_{il}v_lc_{jl}}{\\\\alpha_l^Rr^R_l} + \\\\sum_m \\\\frac{a_{im}wa_{jm}}{\\\\alpha_m^Pr^P_m}\\\\right)/s_is_j, which represents the amount to which resource consumption and predator attack are linearly related between two competing species, i and j. This model conditions for coexistence can be directly related to the general coexistence criterion: intraspecific competition, Œ±jj, must be greater than interspecific competition, Œ±ij. The direct expressions for intraspecific and interspecific competition coefficients from the interaction between shared predators and resources are \\\\alpha_{jj} = s_j/k_j and \\\\alpha_{ij} = \\\\rho s_j/k_i. Thus, when intraspecific competition is greater than interspecific competition, \\\\alpha_{jj} > \\\\alpha_{ij} = \\\\frac{s_j}{k_j} > \\\\rho \\\\frac{s_j}{k_i} which, for two species leads to the coexistence criteria \\\\rho < \\\\frac{k_1}{k_2} < \\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho}. Notice that, in the absence of any niche differences (i.e. œÅ = 1), species cannot coexist. Stabilizing mechanisms In 1994, Chesson proposed that all stabilizing mechanisms could be categorized into four categories. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and it is possible for all four to operate in any environment at a given time. # Variation-independent mechanisms (also called fluctuation-independent mechanisms) are any stabilizing mechanism that functions within a local place and time. Resource partitioning, predator partitioning, and frequency-dependent predation are three classic examples of variation-independent mechanisms. When a species is at very low density, individuals gain an advantage, because they are less constrained by competition across the landscape. For example, under frequency-dependent predation, a species is less likely to be consumed by predators when they are very rare. # The storage effect occurs when species are affected differently by environmental variation in space or time. For example, coral reef fishes have different reproductive rates in different years, plants grow differently in different soil types, and desert annual plants germinate at different rates in different years. When a species is at low density, individuals gain an advantage because they experience less competition in times or locations that they grow best. For example, if annual plants germinate in different years, then when it is a good year to germinate, species will be competing predominately with members of the same species. Thus, if a species becomes rare, individuals will experience little competition when they germinate whereas they would experience high competition if they were abundant. For the storage effect to function, species must be able to \\"store\\" the benefits of a productive time period or area, and use it to survive during less productive times or areas. This can occur, for example, if species have a long-lived adult stage, a seed bank or diapause stage, or if they are spread out over the environment. # A fitness-density covariance occurs when species are spread out non-uniformly across the landscape. Most often, it occurs when species are found in different areas. For example, mosquitoes often lay eggs in different locations, and plants who partition habitat are often found predominately where they grow best. Species can gain two possible advantages by becoming very rare. First, because they are physically separated from other species, they mainly compete with members of the same species (and thus experience less competition when they become very rare). Second, species are often more able to concentrate in favorable habitat as their densities decline. For example, if individuals are territorial, then members of an abundant species may not have access to ideal habitat; however, when that species becomes very rare, then there may be enough ideal habitat for all of the few remaining individuals. # Relative nonlinearity occurs when species benefit in different ways from variation in competitive factors. For example, two species might coexist if one can grow better when resources are rare, and the other grows better when resources are abundant. Species will be able to coexist if the species which benefits from variation in resources tends to reduce variation in resources. For example, a species which can rapidly consume excess resources tends to quickly reduce the level of excess resources favoring the other species, whereas a species which grows better when resources are rare is more likely to cause fluctuations in resource density favoring the other species. Empirical evidence A 2012 study reviewed different approaches which tested coexistence theory, and identified three main ways to separate the contributions of stabilizing niche and relative fitness differences within a community. These are: # Experimental manipulations, which involved determining the effect of relative fitness or stabilizing mechanisms by manipulating resources or competitive advantages. # Trait-Phylogeny- Environment relationships, in which the phylogeny of members of a set of communities can be tested for evidence of trait clustering, which would suggest that certain traits are important (and perhaps necessary) to thrive in that environment, or trait overdispersion, which would suggest a high ability of species to exclude close relatives. Such tests have been widely used, although they have also been criticized as simplistic and flawed. # Demographic analyses, which can be used to recognize frequency- or density- dependent processes simply by measuring the number and per-capita growth rates of species in natural communities over time. If such processes are operating, the per-capita growth rate would vary with the number of individuals in species comprising the community. A 2010 review argued that an invasion analysis should be used as the critical test of coexistence. In an invasion analysis, one species (termed the \\"invader\\") is removed from the community, and then reintroduced at a very low density. If the invader shows positive population growth, then it cannot be excluded from the community. If every species has a positive growth rate as an invader, then those species can stably coexist. An invasion analysis could be performed using experimental manipulation, or by parameterizing a mathematical model. The authors argued that in the absence of a full-scale invasion analysis, studies could show some evidence for coexistence by showing that a trade-off produced negative density-dependence at the population level. The authors reviewed 323 papers (from 1972 to May 2009), and claimed that only 10 of them met the above criteria (7 performing an invasion analysis, and 3 showing some negative- density dependence). However, an important caveat is that invasion analysis may not always be sufficient for identifying stable coexistence. For example, priority effects or Allee effects may prevent species from successfully invading a community from low density even if they could persist stably at a higher density. Conversely, high order interactions in communities with many species can lead to complex dynamics following an initially successful invasion, potentially preventing the invader from persisting stably in the long term. For example, an invader that can only persist when a particular resident species is present at high density could alter community structure following invasion such that that resident species' density declines or that it goes locally extinct, thereby preventing the invader from successfully establishing in the long term. Neutral theory and coexistence theory The 2008 Neutral theory by Stephen Hubbell attempts to model biodiversity through a migration-speciation-extinction balance, rather through selection. It assumes that all members within a guild are inherently the same, and that changes in population density are a result of random births and deaths. Particular species are lost stochastically through a random walk process, but species richness is maintained via speciation or external migration. Neutral theory can be seen as a particular case of coexistence theory: it represents an environment where stabilizing mechanisms are absent (i.e., A = 0), and there are no differences in average fitness (i.e., k_i - \\\\hat{k} = 0 for all species). It has been hotly debated how close real communities are to neutrality. Few studies have attempted to measure fitness differences and stabilizing mechanisms in plant communities, for example in 2009 or in 2015 These communities appear to be far from neutral, and in some cases, stabilizing effects greatly outweigh fitness differences. Cultural coexistence theory Cultural Coexistence Theory (CCT), also called Social- ecological Coexistence Theory, expands on coexistence theory to explain how groups of people with shared interests in natural resources (e.g., a fishery) can come to coexist sustainably. Cultural Coexistence Theory draws on work by anthropologists such as Frederik Barth and John Bennett, both of whom studied the interactions among culture groups on shared landscapes. In addition to the core ecological concepts described above, which CCT summarizes as limited similarity, limited competition, and resilience, CCT argues the following features are essential for cultural coexistence: # Adaptability describes the ability of people to respond to change or surprise. It is essential to CCT because it helps capture the importance of human agency. # Pluralism describes where people value cultural diversity and recognize the fundamental rights of people not like them to live in the same places and access shared resources. # Equity as used in CCT describes whether social institutions exist that ensure that people's basic human rights, including the ability to meet basic needs, are protected, and whether people are protected from being marginalized in society. Cultural Coexistence Theory fits in under the broader area of sustainability science, common pool resources theory, and conflict theory.

It is the second film version of the 1929 novel of the same name by William Faulkner (the previous adaptation, directed by Martin Ritt, was released in 1959). The film was released in a limited release and through video on demand on October 23, 2015, by New Films International. Plot The film focuses on the Compson family, and their struggles to adjust to the changing society of the 20th century Deep South, told from four different perspectives: the mentally handicapped Benjy Compson, the fragile intellectual Quentin, the vile Jason and his family's old black servant, Dilsey. Cast * James Franco as Benjy Compson * Jacob Loeb as Quentin Compson * Joey King as Miss Quentin * Tim Blake Nelson as Jason Compson III * Loretta Devine as Dilsey * Ahna O'Reilly as Caddy Compson * Scott Haze as Jason Compson IV * Kylen Davis as Luster * Seth Rogen as Telegraph operator (cameo) * Danny McBride as Sheriff (cameo) * Dwight Henry as Roskus * Logan Marshall-Green as Dalton Ames In an early interview with Franco in 2013, the director suggested he wanted Jon Hamm in the role of Mr. Compson. Hamm's schedule was too tight and the role ultimately went to Tim Blake Nelson, but in spite of this the story that Hamm was in the movie persisted. Even as late as the film's screening at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival some playbills still made this claim, and the posters had to be reprinted before opening.Toronto Star, September 9, 2014, pg. E1 Production In January 2014, it was reported Keegan Allen, Tim Blake Nelson, Seth Rogen, Danny McBride, Loretta DeVine, and Janet Gretzky had joined the cast of the film. Release The film had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival on September 5, 2014. It was selected to screen at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 6, 2014. The film was scheduled to be released in a limited release and through video on demand on October 23, 2015. Reception The film received mostly negative reviews from film critics, with many feeling that Franco was incapable of presenting such a complex novel in a cinematic fashion.FilmAffinity Paul McInnis of The Guardian, writing from Toronto, said, ‚ÄúFranco attempts to recreate the book's impressionistic style and complex structure. He makes a fist of it, but in concentrating so much on the art he fails to give the viewer any story or characters to care about.‚Äù Andrew Barker of Variety, felt that the film was \\"a folly, failing to capture the weird, entrancing, often maddening ambiance of the great writer‚Äôs elliptical masterpiece, and its surfeit of half-baked film- student flourishes and needless cameos occasionally give it an amateur-hour feel. But Franco nonetheless shows improvement over 2013‚Äôs As I Lay Dying, and well, it‚Äôs hard to fault him for trying.\\" Currently, review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 'rotten' rating of 25%.
