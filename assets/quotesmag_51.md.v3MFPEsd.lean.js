The existence of this lake event is documented by tufa mounds which are up to high. It belongs to a series of ancient lakes which covered the southern Altiplano in Bolivia, reaching a maximum surface area of . This series includes several phases, two major phases named Lake Tauca and Ouki as well as a few minor ones. These lake phases appear to occur in response to increased moisture supply from the Amazon. The formation of the Salinas lake was probably accompanied by a 50-100% increase of precipitation. The Salinas event lasted between approximately 95,000 and 80,000 years ago. It was preceded by another lake event, Ouki. Alternatively, it may be part of the Ouki event, more specifically of its waning stage. The Ouki and Salinas lake cycles coincided with cooling events in the North Atlantic, glacier expansions in the Puna and with changes to alluvial fans at Llano de Chajnantor. During the Salinas lake cycle, lake levels did not rise above altitude, but overall lake levels were variable. Overall the lake covered a surface area of if the Poopo basin is included, or if not. The hydrology of the Salinas event includes water flow from the Lake Poopo into the Salar de Coipasa/Salar de Uyuni basin, as in the previous Ouki phase. This input probably did not exceed 45% of the total water supply of the Salinas lake.

Legacy  Entamoeba histolytica life cycle Bhattacharya's researches were focused on parasitology, computation biology and bioinformatics, with special focus on the biology of Entamoeba histolytica, an anaerobic parasitic protozoan causing amoebiasis. His studies elucidated the molecular mechanisms during the opsonization process of the pathogen and identified new proteins such as EhCaBP1, EhCaBP3 and EhC2PK which play a role in the phagocytosis and actin dynamics of the parasite. His team developed new genomic tools and also proposed new algorithms for the identification of genomic variations. His work on lipophosphoglycan and its identification and characterization as well as on the species-specific calcium binding protein and its gene are reported to have been pioneering. These studies are known to have widened the understanding of the pathogenesis of the protozoan at the molecular level. For pursuing his researches on Entamoeba histolytica, he founded a dedicated laboratory at JNU.

He was followed by his son John Croker, who was followed by his son Sir John Croker (died 1508), a Member of Parliament for Devon in 1491 (whose inscribed monumental brass showing him dressed in armour survives in Yealmpton ChurchSee: Mee, Arthur, The Kings England ‚Äì Devon) who married twice, firstly to Elizabeth Yeo, a daughter of Robert Yeo of Heanton Satchville, Petrockstowe, secondly to Elizabeth Fortescue, daughter of Sir Richard Fortescue and widow of a certain Elliott. He was followed by his son John Croker, by his first wife Elizabeth Yeo. This John Croker married twice, firstly to Jone Arundell, daughter of Humphry Arundell of \\"Selley\\", without children, and secondly to Elizabeth Pollard, a daughter of Sir Lewis Pollard (c. 1465 ‚Äì 1526) of Grilstone in the parish of Bishop's Nympton, a Justice of the Common Pleas and Member of Parliament for Totnes. She survived him and remarried to Sir Hugh Trevanion.Vivian, p.598, pedigree of Pollard He was followed by another John Croker (the sixth, who died in 1560), his son by Elizabeth Pollard, who married Elizabeth Strode, a daughter of Richard Strode (died 1552) of Newnham in the parish of Plympton St Mary, who in 1538 following the Dissolution of the Monasteries purchased the demesne lands of Plympton Priory, the second wealthiest monastery in Devon.Pole, p.326 His son was the seventh John Croker (1652‚Äì1614) who married Agnes Servington, daughter of John Servington of Tavistock. His son was Hugh Croker (died before 1614), who pre-deceased his father, having married Agnes Bonville, only daughter and heiress of Richard Bonville of Modbury, a descendant of John Bonville (died 1491), lord of the manor of Combe Raleigh,Pole, p.132 Devon, and bastard son of the magnate William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville (died 1461).Vivian, pp.102‚Äì3; His son was John Croker (born 1589), heir to his grandfather, the seventh John Croker. He married a member of the Lee family. His son was also named John (1610‚Äì1633/4), who died unmarried and predeceased his father. John Croker (fl.1657) The next heir was another John Croker, the son of Francis CrokerMarriage Settlement, see Sylvanus Williams, p.22 of Lyneham (heir to his brother John Croker of Lyneham). In 1657 he married Jane Pole (born 1625), 4th daughter of Sir John Pole, 1st Baronet (died 1658)Vivian, p.603, pedigree of Pole of Shute and Bromley St Leonard, Middlesex, and sister of Sir Courtenay Pole, 2nd Baronet. Mary Pole, the eldest daughter of Sir John Pole, 1st Baronet, and aunt of Sir Courtenay Pole, 2nd Baronet, in 1606 married (as her second husband) Francis Courtenay (1576‚Äì1638), de jure 4th Earl of Devon, lord of the manor of Powderham, but produced no children. There was no immediate blood connection to the Courtenay family which could be claimed by either the Poles or Crokers, and this connection to Francis Courtenay seemingly accounts for the adoption of the first name \\"Courtenay\\" in the Pole, Croker and Bulteel families. The first name \\"Courtenay\\" was commonly adopted amongst the Devonshire gentry, but usually as a result of descent from a Courtenay daughter. Sir Courtenay Croker (died 1740) The son of this marriage was Sir Courtenay Croker (1660‚Äì1740), MP for Plympton Morice (1695‚Äì1702) (alias Plympton Erle)History of Parliament biography \\"Plympton Erle\\", John Prince (contemporary) \\"Plympton Morice\\" and the \\"last male of the name\\".Prince The first name Courtenay was often adopted by descendants via a female line of the prominent Courtenay family lords of the manor of Powderham in Devon, a junior line of the extinct Courtenay Earls of Devon of Tiverton Castle. However neither Croker himself nor his uncle Sir Courtenay Pole, 2nd Baronet, could claim this distinction. In 1699 Prince reported that:Prince, p.270 > As to the present seat of the family, Lineham aforesaid, it is an antient > house, which being grown weak and descript thro‚Äô age, is now a repairing, or > rather rebuilding, by the present possessor, Courtenay Crocker > aforementioned, who is a justice of peace for the county, and a burgess of > parliament, this present year 1699, for the burrough of Plimton Morice, in > this shire The house he built survives largely intact today. Sir Courtenay Croker married twice: firstly on about 1691 to Catharine Hillersdon, daughter and co-heiress of Richard Hillersdon of Membland in the parish of Holbeton, by whom he had one daughter and sole heiress Mary Croker, wife of James Bulteel. Secondly in 1696 he married Katherine Tucker, a daughter and co-heiress of John Tucker of Exeter, without children.Cruickshanks, Eveline, biography of Croker, Courtenay (1660‚Äì1740), of Lyneham, Devon, published in History of Parliament: House of Commons 1690-1715, ed.

He sold his previous home, Preston Candover in Hampshire, to John Sainsbury, 1st Baron Sainsbury \\"of Preston Candover\\" and purchased Lyneham. He soon sold it, and moved to Upton Grey Lodge in Hampshire, stating that \\"police harassment had made his life there intolerable\\".Obituary, Daily Telegraph newspaper 18 Apr 2006 This related to his having \\"developed a particularly fierce animosity\\" towards the chief constable of Devon and Cornwall, whose appearances on Westward Television news programmes he had tried to censor. He also got into difficulties with that police force when he was charged with wasting police time in connection with an anonymous letter alleging local authority corruption in Plymouth, and for shooting a protected species of goose.

He was born to a Christian family in a village on Mount Lebanon in 1849 and later studied medicine at the Syrian Protestant College in Beirut. Conversion and emigration Ibrahim George Kheiralla converted to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith while living in Egypt in 1889 when he met H√°j√≠  ªAbdu'l-Kar√≠m-i-Tihr√°n√≠. Kheiralla went through Europe and eventually came to the United States in late 1892 where he joined Anton Haddad, the first Bah√° º√≠ to come to America. Initially, Kheiralla settled in New York where he began teaching \\"Truth Seeker\\" classes. He visited Charles Augustus Briggs and others, as well as the Syrian community in New York. In 1894 Kheiralla moved on to Chicago following the interest fostered by the World's Columbian Exposition's World Parliament of Religions. In Chicago he taught \\"Truth Seeker\\" classes. One of the early converts while Kheiralla was in Chicago was Thornton Chase, who had read the presentation about the Bah√° º√≠s at the Exposition, and is generally considered the first Bah√° º√≠ convert in the West. Other individuals had converted, but none remained members of the religion. Researcher Robert Stockman considers Chase's importance as an early North American Bah√° º√≠ thinker, publicist, administrator, and organizer is still underappreciated and that in many ways Chase's death left a gap in the North American Bah√° º√≠ community that remained unfilled until the rise to prominence in the early 1920s of Horace Holley, the chief developer of Bah√° º√≠ organization in the United States and Canada. Another to join the religion from Kheiralla's early classes was Howard MacNutt, who would later compile The Promulgation of Universal Peace, a prominent collection of the addresses of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° during his journeys in America. Both men were designated as \\"Disciples of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°\\" and \\"Heralds of the Covenant\\" by Shoghi Effendi. Another student of the classes and Disciple was Lua Getsinger, designated as the \\"mother teacher of the West\\". Another who \\"passed\\" the class and joined the religion was the maverick Honor√© Jackson. Kheiralla moved once again, to Kenosha, Wisconsin, in 1895, where a large Bah√° º√≠ community soon developed. Because of his success promulgating the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in North America,  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° titled Kheiralla \\"Bah√°'s Peter,\\" \\"the Second Columbus\\" and \\"Conqueror of America.\\"  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° would write a Tablet to Ibr√°h√≠m George Kheiralla. Pilgrimage and return to America In 1898, Kheiralla undertook a Bah√° º√≠ pilgrimage to Palestine to meet  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° with other American pilgrims, including Phoebe Hearst, Lua Getsinger and May Boles. In Akka, Kheiralla witnessed first hand the conflict between  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° and his brothers. Upon his return to America in 1899, Kheiralla began to announce his avowed leadership of Western Bah√° º√≠s independent of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° and authored a book, Beha'u'llah, wherein he states his belief that  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° was equal in rank to his brothers M√≠rz√° Muhammad  ªAl√≠, ·∏å√≠y√° ºu'll√°h, and Badi ªu'll√°h. Early after the return to America,  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° sent, first, Anton Haddad with a letter contesting the definition of leadership, then Khieralla's initial teacher of the religion,  ªAbdu'l-Kar√≠m-i-Tihr√°n√≠, to confront him. The conflict made the newspapers. * Ultimately, in the conflict between  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° and M√≠rz√° Muhammad  ªAl√≠, Kheiralla sided with the latter for which he was declared a Covenant-breaker. Kheiralla would go on to form the \\"Society of Behaists,\\" which would later be led by Shua Ullah Behai and eventually become defunct. Kheiralla had three children, two daughters who were named Nabeeha and Labiba, and a son named George Ibrahim Kheirallah who converted to Islam in the 1930s, becoming active in the Islamic Society of New York, and translated and published some poems of Khalil Gibran.

There are no permanent towns or roads in the area. There are three large lakes in the Kumkol basin of the reserve: Lake Ayakum, Lake Aqqikkal, and Lake Jingyu. All are saline (\\"salt lakes\\"). The northernmost, Lake Ayakum, is at an altitude of 12,685 feet and has an area of 283 sqmi. Its depth reaches 74 feet. To the west of Lake Ayakum is Lake Aqqikkal, at an altitude of 13,940 ft, and which is 16 miles across. Lake Jingyu is the southernmost. Climate Because of its high altitude (over 4,500 meters above sea level) and arid location thousands of kilometers from any ocean and in the rain shadow of the Himalayas and other mountain, the climate of the reserve is \\"Cold desert climate\\" (K√∂ppen climate classification \\"BWk\\" ). This climate is characterized by hot, dry summers, and very cold, dry winters. At the highest elevations, the climate is a Polar climate (Koppen \\"ET\\") with cooler summers but still cold and dry in the winter. Ecoregion Most of the reserve is in the \\"North Tibetan Plateau-Kunlun Mountains alpine desert\\" ecoregion, an area characterized by extreme aridity, high winds, and very cold winters. The northeast of the reserve around Lake Ayakum is in the Qaidam Basin semi-desert ecoregion. Qaidam is the Mongolian word for 'salt', and the region is one of gravelly desert and some saline meadows and salt lakes. Temperatures reach an average high of in August, and average lows of in January. There is little to no precipitation in most years, but some frost cover. Flora and fauna The reserve provides space outside of human development for some of the largest herds of hoofed in Asia: the vulnerable Tibetan wild yak (Bos mutus) (an estimated 10,000), wild ass (30,000), and Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii) (up to 75,000). The area is also an important habitat for the endangered Kozlov's Pika, and the relatively common Ladak pika. There are also small populations of dholes (Wild Asiatic dogs). Access Access is restricted, and high permit fees are required to enter. The soil is fragile and there are no permanent roads.

They now mostly reside at Bidyadanga, south of Broome. To their north lived the Yawuru people, to the east the Mangala, to the northeast the Nyigina, and to their south the Nyangumarta. Further down the coast were the Kariera. Language The first description of the grammar of their language, Garadjeri, was published by Gerhardt Laves in 1931. It belongs to the Marngu branch of the Pama-Nyungan language family. The native conceptualization of its varieties recognizes 4 dialect forms, the Najanaja (or Murrkut) dialect spoken by coastal Karajarri, Nangu spoken in the central hinterlands and Nawurtu further east inland. Garadjeri has had a notable influence on the Yawuru language, many of whose terms for ceremonials, and for naming the indigenous flora and fauna, have been borrowed from the Karajarri. Less than 20 native speakers (2004) remain. Together with Nyangumarta, Karrajarri shows some features that are exceptional within the Kimberley Pama- Nyungan languages, in having bound pronominals affixed to inflecting verbs. Country According to Norman Tindale, Karajarri territory covered about . Running from Cape Villaret on the south of Roebuck Bay until a point 10 miles north of Jawinja, at the intertribal corroboree gathering site known as Manari. Their inland extension reached east as far as 70 miles. Notable Karajarri sites marking their boundaries were at Lendjarkading,' Redjarth, Undurmadatj and Mount Phire(Paijara). Traditional social structure The Karajarri were divided into two distinct groups, those who inhabited the coastal areas, called Naja (Nadja), and the inlanders dwelling on the eastern plains and bushlands, the Nawutu (Naudu). The social hierarchy was headed by ritual leaders (pirrka, literally 'roots of a tree'), male elders who organized ceremonial life, and who are also responsible for management of the country and the general affairs of tribal members. Members of a Karajarri group were classified in four ways, panaka, purrungu, parrjari and karimpa, a tribal taxonomy that is determined by alternate generation levels distinguished along moiety lines called inara. Thus one inara, represented by the barn swallow ('wiyurr), is panaka-purrungu, being constituted by self, grandparents, sisters, brothers, cousins and grandchildren, together with marriageable partners and their siblings, the other, karimpa-parrjarri, is inclusive of one's mother, father, aunts, uncles, great grandparents and grandchildren, and is emblemized in terms of the fork-tailed swift (kitirr). Both the kitirr and wiyurr are viewed as heralds of rain. Pukarri (dream) connote states of reality formed in the mythic dreamtime when the landscape was created, and exercises a binding, inviolable force, the word being applied to institutional practices that are traced back to the primal order of things in a given tribal country (ngurrara). Marriage and kinship relationships are influenced by factors related to the implications that arise from their legends concerning the living waters. Ecology The area encompassed by Karajarri lands sits on the La Grange sub-basin, one of the richest groundwater areas in Western Australia, and a Pindan ecology, the pirra of the Karajarri inland, with stygofauna which has yet to be studied in any depth. The Karajarri perceive their world (ngurrara (one's own country') in terms of a mythology that weaves seamlessly together all the features of the landscape, the language and customs, a nexus which was then reflected in ritual practices. The language itself, as is generally the case among indigenous cultures of Australia, is thought of in terms of particular stretches of country, and each form was first spoken by the Dreamtime being who wandered the land, speaking each tongue depending on the tract of land where its speakers came to dwell. In the Karajarri conception, one shared by many other nations in the region, such as the Nyigina, Yawuru, Nyangumarta and Mangala, the land is understood as coming from the 'Dreaming' (pukarrikarra), of which they are the custodians. Given the scarcity of fresh water, what they call 'living water'(karnangkul), the Karajarri secured their resources by a system of wells, soaks (lirri) and springs throughout the wetlands. The management of the karnangkul is dictated by the need to respect and placate powerful serpentine beings (pulany/bulaing) in the waters. The concept may reflect, etymology suggests, a residue of the conception of a rainbow serpent, still attested in Arnhem Land lore (bolung). The word may be linked to the Arnhem land variant.) There is a complex mythology concerning the living waters, focused on the spirits, pulany, dangerous or benign, that are thought to inhabit them, and are thought to be responsible for the seasonal replenishment of these water places (ngapa). Special ceremonies are undertaken to ensure that the water beings make rain. Camping is avoided in such sites. The presence of such water snakes is often attested by panyjin reeds, the whiskers of the pulany, which can travel underground to emerge from tulkarru holes. There exists a Karajarri song to entice back into the waters the ancestral serpent if a spring dries up, in order to refresh the aquifer. It is transmitted for such an emergency, though circumstances have never changed to require its recitation. The first whiteman's survey of the area, conducted by a party led by Frederick Kennedy Panter, commander of the schooner New Perseverance. After striking inland for 50 miles, Panter returned to report that the land was furnished with numerous native wells, thickly wooded and endowed with groves of cajeput eucalypts suitable for construction. Overall, Panter concluded the Karajarri lands offered '40,000 acres of splendidly grassed land,' while the natives were 'quiet' and 'friendly'. The area was one the Karajarri call pajalpi or 'spring country' given the richness of its spring waters and the lush growth of local plants there. History of contact The Karajarri developed a ceremonial rite (milyankurl) in order to govern the introduction of strangers into their midst, and to pacify the potential for danger in these encounters. They call non indigenous people walanyu (strangers from beyond), a concept that also embraces hostile spirits (wirangu) and other inland aboriginal people. It is thought that East Asian maritime sailors visited their region before the era of white exploration. Generally they would trade and barter with the Asian hired hands working the British pearling luggers, such as the Timorese, Chinese, Malays, Javanese and Japanese. In Karajarri practice, walanyu could drop their outsider status once if the recognized the pirrka, were properly introduced, and had exchanged gifts. After Panter's report was circulated, the Roebuck Bay Pastoral Company was formed and a ship, the Nile, was commissioned in Freemantle to establish a presence in Karakarri territory, with company representatives and a contingent of police troopers. They set up a camp near Cape Vilaret and appropriated a local well, one of the few on the coast with fresh water. Hostilities broke out, as sorties to take over wells or cut timber were resisted. Attempts to drive them off were repelled for some months, causing the loss of life among some locals. An expedition led by James Richard Harding (1838‚Äì1864), comprising Panter, William Henry Goldwyer (1829‚Äì1864) and 3 police troopers, set out to explore the pajalpi lands suitable for pastoral development south around La Grange Bay. Martin had reported a regular system of wells 3‚Äì4 m deep, at intervals of a mile, stretching inland from Roebuck and La Grange. The three intruders encountered native resistance and, in a day, in two incidents shot 3 Indigenous people then a further 15, as they defended their campsite at a small lake called Boolla Boolla, otherwise known to the Karajarri as Injitana, a Karajarri sacred ceremonial site. According to their traditional account, the expedition had desecrated a sacred site (jinjarlkuriny), a rainmaking permanent water place (jila). The whitemen in turn were overrun and killed. The Nile left the area in January 1865 with the men still missing. Stock routes in the 1880s such as those opened up by Nat Buchanan, who developed the de Grey-Kimberley stockroute, often followed aboriginal dreamtime contours and their sacred watering sites, and, as government inspectors noted, those who took up pastoral leases often then denied native peoples access to the wells on their stations. Eventually the Karajarri and other regional tribes, esp. after the Aborigines Act (1905), were taken on as indentured labour, their local knowledge of the waterways and lay of the land being of great use to the pastoralists. In the 1930s the anthropologists Ralph Piddington and A. P. Elkin surveyed the water soaks and wells, and their function within Karajarri thought and life. Native title and development Following the landmark High Court Mabo ruling handed down in 1992, which repudiated the prevailing doctrine that Australia had been a terra nullius, and recognized the common law validity of the concept of native title, the Karajarri moved to gather evidence for an application to secure legal acknowledgement and endorsement of their claim to the traditional Karajarri lands. At the same time Western Agricultural Industries (WAI), a private development company, was eyeing the Karajarri lands for the potential their abundant waters offered for establishing a vast irrigation scheme for cotton production, though subsidiary cultivations of sugar cane, leucaena, exotic hardwoods, hemp, viticulture and freshwater aquafarming were also envisaged. The earlier Camballin Irrigation Scheme, implementing similar aims, turned the region immediately to the north of the Karajarri lands into a dustbowl, the toxic wash out of chemical fertilisers leading to drastic losses of local fish-eating species like pelicans and ibis, and the disappearance of kangaroos. The principle of earlier law remains in place: the waters themselves are commonwealth property, and the indigenous peoples have only the right of usufruct.

Company history Ross and Co. of Dublin were one of the most important makers of campaign furniture in the Victorian era and they are still considered as a leader in their field, today. Eleanor Ross founded the company E. Ross at 6 Ellis Quay at the end of the 18th century. The business capitalized on the demand for portable furniture that accompanied the expansion of the British Empire in the 19th century. The increased movement of administrators, colonists and of course the army and navy to service Britain's overseas territories, provided a strong customer base for their campaign equipage. James Ross Murphy and Patrick Murphy are also associated with the business but their exact relationship to Eleanor is as yet unknown. It is likely Eleanor married James after the formation of her business and various newspaper articles refer to either a Mrs. Murphy, Messrs Murphy Ross & Co. or Mrs. Ross at the Ellis Quay address. Although examples of domestic furniture by Ross are known a large part of their business was campaign furniture. designed to quickly fold or pack down for ease of travel. The company advertised that they were established in 1790 but their earliest found advert is their directory listing of 1820 which states: Ross Eleanor, (furn. ware) 6, Ellis Quay. By 1822 the entry changed to Ross E. Army Furniture warehouse, 6, Ellis-quay. They remained on the quay throughout their history although their address is listed in the Dublin Directories at various combinations of the numbers between 5 and 11 and they are known to have also later had a factory at 35 Tighe Street (now named Benburb Street). These two locations were of course ideally located for the many officers stationed at The Royal Barracks (now Collins Barracks) and this no doubt was a benefit to the business; a fact also picked up on by John Ireland, their neighbour and an Army Clothier, who was located at 11 Ellis Quay in 1850. The company's origin is unknown but in 1821 they are listed in the directories as being located at 6 Ellis Quay, and an advertisement from the mid 1800s states 'Established 1760'. Eleanor Ross is described in the 'Commercial directory of Ireland, Scotland and the four most northern counties of England 1820‚Äô as being a proprietor of ‚Äúfurn. Ware‚Äù, 6 Ellis Quay. Ross & Co. remained on the quay throughout their history although their address is listed in the Dublin Directories at various combinations of the numbers between 5 and 11 and they are known to have also later had a factory at 35 Tighe Street (now named Benburb Street). These two locations were of course ideally located for the many officers stationed at Collins Barracks and this no doubt was a benefit to the business; a fact also picked up on by John Ireland, their neighbour and an army clothier, who was located at 11 Ellis Quay in 1850. Ross stand out from the many other campaign furniture makers of the period for a number of reasons but perhaps the most important is their originality in design. As can be seen from the adverts of the London makers of the day, such as Hill & Millard, J W Allen and Day & Son they were all making fairly similar campaign pieces. Their adverts would typically show a two part chest of drawers, a washstand, folding bed and a Douro pattern chair. There would be the odd item that was specific to a particular maker but generally by the mid 19th century there were standard pieces that most officers would require and which they could easily find from a number of makers. Apart from their most basic chest of drawers, which followed the traditional design, most items manufactured by Ross differed greatly to that by other makers. A number of their chests would have a clever, folding superstructure or an unusual combination of drawers, their washstands wouldn't have the normal brass standards adopted by the other makers but have turned columns and their easy chairs would put comfort at a premium. Much of Ross's work can be considered typical of the William IV and Victorian periods in its use of the fashionable design features of the day. This would of course have given their cabinet making greater appeal than that which was purely utilitarian; an important factor to their customers who would mostly have been well heeled gentleman officers with an eye for the stylish. It also means that much of it is not obviously made for campaign until close inspection. A good example of this is the Desk Chair below, that breaks down into eight pieces for travel. Suites of furniture The majority of campaign furniture was commissioned or retailed as individual pieces but Ross very cleverly gave the option of buying a suite of furniture. Such a suite would have a combination of a short set of dining chairs, an easy chair, a couch, a center table and a chiffonier or sideboard which broke down to become the packing case. On the inside door of the cabinet furniture would be a label, giving packing instructions. The packing case cabinets were often adorned with carved decoration and moulding, which again was unusual for campaign furniture that mostly considered flat surfaces and square edges to be a pre-requisite. However, when it came to packing the cabinet, the moulding would be removed and the carved show wood protected with a bolt on panel so no sacrifice was made for the added decoration. Perhaps the most famous such suite is that made for Captain Simner of the 76th Regiment and his wife, Francis Mary Bolton, as a wedding present on March the 27th, 1863. It was made from walnut taken from the family estate at Bective, in Ireland and travelled with the Captain and his wife to Madras, Burma and Secunderabad over a 12-year period. They may well have considered it their best wedding present, as it must have given great comfort in the very different climate of the Far East. Ross's concessions to embellishment with the carving probably also gave a reminder of the Europe that they had left behind and so a feeling of a little luxury in a harder environment. Labelling and numbering Ross labeled most of their work with either a painted stencil, or small ivory or brass plaque, with their current address at Ellis Quay. That which is not labeled was probably from a suite, where other items would have the Ross mark. However it is usually relatively easy to recognize Ross campaign furniture from its other traits. The use of walnut was common for Ross, perhaps because they recognized its revival in popularity under the Victorians, which again, would give an added selling point. Yet it was atypical of most campaign furniture makers who generally preferred mahogany or teak. Ross's numbering, for ease of assembly, of the individual parts that make up a piece of furniture is also unique. Most campaign furniture makers used a simple system, often using Roman numerals but always starting, naturally, with the number one. Furniture by Ross is often given a two digit number or sometimes a letter and number depending on the item, and Roman numerals are not noted as having been used. An example of such numbering is the set of four Balloon Back Chairs, illustrated, where the numbers range from 62 and 63 on the first chair to 70 and 71 on the second, 74 and 75 on the third and 92 and 93 on the fourth. Although at first this seemingly random system of numbering does not seem to make sense, it was logical for a factory that may have been making several pieces of the same item of furniture at the same time. Added to this, Ross were likely selling their wares to members of the same regiments and their numbering system may well have saved future confusion amongst brother officers. Recognition Ross prospered and by 1864 their reputation was sealed by the approval of the Prince of Wales. By 1882, the Army recommended them. The Report of the Kabul Committee on Equipment (Calcutta) stated \\". . . the committee now consider it to be necessary for the comfort of an officer, that he should have a bed, and they find that the pattern‚Ä¶made by Ross of Dublin is the most suitable. It weighs under 20lbs.\\" The success Ross and Co. of Dublin enjoyed throughout the 19th century can be attributed to a number of factors, including their skill at that cabinet making. This quality of work, coupled with their ingenuity of design, which was quite distinctive from their contemporaries, and attention to the popular styles of the day proved a winning combination. However, Ross also had other factors working in their favour to create a strong customer base. Not only were a large percentage of the British Army's officers Irish but Ross were clever enough to position themselves close to one of the biggest barracks in Europe. The barracks were garrisoned by an army that had spread itself across the world and whose mostly landed officers could afford the best, wished to travel in style and to have all the comforts of home when they arrived at their destination. Decline In December 1905, Ross & Co. announced their retirement from business with a subsequent auction in The Irish Times, as well as a number of other publications. Subsequent auctions of their remaining goods and properties continued over the next 2 years. As of 1909 there is no listing for Ross in the directories. Their last address of 8, 9 & 10 Ellis Quay is listed as vacant, surrounded by tenements. The world and how war was conducted had changed significantly by the beginning of the 20th century. The Boers, with their speed of movement and good use of the ambush had taught the British Army a sharp lesson. H. O. Arnold-Forster, the Secretary of State for War perhaps recognized that things had to change when in 1903 he said ‚ÄòThe British Army is a social institution prepared for every emergency except that of war.‚Äô Domestic use had also tailed off, there weren't as many colonists as in past generations and those that were heading off to make a new life knew that their destination was now far better set up to furnish them than in their ancestor's days. The emergence of the motorcar also meant people could travel farther more quickly and so did not need to take as much with them for the comfort of a long journey. Added to this Ross probably suffered from the same effect that many independent retailers also do today, the popularity of the supermarket. The end of the 19th century saw the spectacular rise of Army and Navy Stores, where everything could be bought and shipped to its destination, from a travel shaving brush to a tent.

Process management offers project organizations a means of applying the same quality improvement and defect reduction techniques used in business and manufacturing processes by taking a process view of project activity; modeling discrete activities and high-level processes. Manufacturers are accustomed to Cooper et al. (2008).Mitchell (2016). See Chapter 3 Process Management‚ÄîEvolution and Definition.  Overview  The term process management usually refers to the management of engineering processes and project management processes where a process is a collection of related, structured tasks that produce a specific service or product to address a certain goal for a particular actor or set of actors.Krogstie (2013) Processes can be executed with procedures. They can be described as a sequence of steps that can execute a process and their value lies in that they are an accepted method of accomplishing a consistent performance or results. Process management provides engineering and project managers with a means of systemically thinking of project organizations, Semantics concepts and logical frameworks that allow project activities to be planned, executed, analyzed and facilitate learning. In order for process management as defined to deliver consistent performance, it requires definition, elimination of non-Value added activities, continuous improvement, project stakeholder focus and team based approach. Mitchell (2016) notes that managing processes across divisional and organizational boundaries requires a more flexible management strategy as well as close cooperation among managers in diverse functional and operational units to ensure that the process flow is not interrupted by conflicts over lines of authority.Mitchell (2016) cited: Hoban, F. T. (1992, August). \\"An overview of training and development strategies for NASA project management.\\" PM Network, 44‚Äì49; and Price, M. T. (1992, October). \\"A process approach to project manager training.\\" PM Network, 17‚Äì26 .  History  Process management originated as part of the manufacturing-based application of statistical quality control movement in the late 1920s and early 1930s. What is relatively new, however, is the transition of process management methods from a manufacturing environment to a total company orientation and project management. Process management in the context of project management or engineering represents a change from the traditional concept of organizational authority using hierarchies and organizational structure to one requiring flexibility to ensure efficient process workflows. Mitchell (2016) notes that managing processes across divisional and organizational boundaries requires a more flexible management strategy as well as close cooperation among managers in diverse functional and operational units to ensure that the process flow is not interrupted by conflicts over lines of authority.Mitchell (2016) citing Stinnett (1992) and King (1992) Cooper, et. al.citing Koskela (1992), Love & Gunasekaran (1996) and Kornelius & Wamelink (1998) note that manufacturing has been \\"a constant reference point and a source of innovation in construction\\". There is a new phenomenon occurring within the construction sector that is based upon the development and use of fundamental core management processes to improve the efficiency of the industry.  Topics  = The notion of process = In the field of process management the notion of process, according to Mitchell (2016), can be characterized by: * Why become a project management professional?Choyce, R. (1992, January). \\"Why become a project management professional?\\" PM Network, 32‚Äì33. * Comprehensive program management.Gioia, J. (1992, November). Comprehensive program management. PM Network, 5‚Äì7 These concepts provides management with the following: *A way of thinking systematically about the behavior of people at work in an organizational setting. *A vocabulary of terms, concepts, theories, and methodologies that allow work experiences to be clearly analyzed, shared, and discussed. *Techniques for dealing with many of the problems that commonly occur in the work setting Process management in this context requires engineering knowledge, management activities and skill sets whereas business processes or manufacturing processes require operations management activities, and skill sets. =Tools and Models= Process models are \`an effective way to show how a process works'.Cooper et. al. (2008) is citing Rosenau (1996 Project Management process modeling tools provide managers and engineering professionals with the ability to model their processes, implement and execute those models, and refine the models based on actual performance. The result is that business process modeling tools can provide transparency into project management processes, as well as the centralization of project organization process models and execution metrics. A number of modelling/systems analysis techniques exist such as data flow diagrams (DFD), HIPO model (hierarchy + input-process-output), data modeling and IDEF0 (integration definition language 0 for function modelling) process modelling technique. =Threaded Processes= A process activity that is concurrent or simultaneously executing can be termed a thread.Epstein et al. 2013, Appendix A = ISO 9000 = ISO 9000 promotes the process approach to managing an organization. > ...promotes the adoption of a process approach when developing, implementing > and improving the effectiveness of a quality management system, to enhance > customer satisfaction by meeting customer requirements.Source: clause 0.2 of > ISO 9001:2000 See also * Program management * Project Management * Total Quality Management * Business Process Management * Process Architecture References  Further reading  * Cooper, Rachel, Aouad, Ghassan, and Lee, Angela.

Built in 1824, it is one of the oldest surviving courthouses in the state, and the only surviving one built out of stone. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Description and history The Grand Isle County Courthouse is prominently sited in the linear town center of North Hero, placed on a rise on the west side of US 2 overlooking City Bay. Its main block is a two-story stone structure, built out of locally quarried limestone and covered by a hip roof. An octagonal belfry rises from the center of the roof, and is covered by a gold octagonal onion dome. The main facade is five bays wide, with the entrance at the center, sheltered by a gabled portico with Tuscan columns. Above the entrance is a round-arched sash window; the other windows are rectangular sash, set in openings with granite sills and lintels. A shed-roof addition extends to the rear, and a second ell connects the main block to a two-story wood frame house (formerly a jailer's residence) to the left. with Grand Isle County was organized in 1802, with North Hero named its county seat in 1804. Its early court sessions were held in private facilities such as the hotel and tavern of Jed Ladd, built in North Hero in 1803. With the county rising in population and prosperity, the matter of a permanent courthouse arose in 1823, resulting in the construction of this courthouse's main block the following year. Although there is no documentary support, it may have been designed by Scottish mason James Ritchie, who is credited with building most of the area's few surviving stone buildings of the period. The courthouse initially served as a court, jail, town hall, and church. In 1865 the town hall and church functions were removed to the newly built meeting house next door. In the early 20th century the building underwent further alteration, including construction of the adjacent jailer's house.

Its existence was postulated in 2006 by a group of scientists which had subdivided the Lake Minchin lake cycle in several subcycles. The Lake Minchin cycle had been previously identified in 1904 as a now disappeared lake in the central Altiplano. Sediments attributed to Lake Minchin may be part of Ouki instead. The dating is uncertain, with radiocarbon and uranium-thorium dating yielding different dates spanning the time between 28,200 and 125,990 ¬± 9,580 years ago. Whether Ouki existed is a subject of controversy. In 2011, scientists claimed that the lake did not exist outside of the Lake Poopo basin. The formation of Ouki is associated with a major glaciation and was probably caused by increased precipitation, which has also been observed elsewhere.  General characteristics  Ouki reached a water level of approximately with preserved shorelines at Lake Poopo, and it may have covered the Salar de Uyuni, the Salar de Coipasa and the Lake Poopo area, although the Uyuni and Coipasa basins may have been filled by a separate lake Salinas instead. Estimates of the surface area depend on the assumed lake levels and whether the lake covered only the Lake Poopo basin or also the Uyuni/Coipasa basins. It ranges . The Ouki lake is one of the so-called deep lake cycles, along with Lake Tauca, from which it is separated by a period where water levels dropped below . It has left characteristic tufa deposits which have shapes of inverted cones. The depth of the lake did not exceed . The subsequent Salinas lake cycle may simply be a shrinking stage of the Ouki lake. Likewise, the existence Lake Minchin may be in part based on misattributing deposits left by Ouki. The Ouki lake cycle may be subdivided into individual phases in the future. The Ouki lake was populated by species such as Pisidium bivalves, ostracodes and the Biomphalaria andecola snail. Waters had a high concentration of . While one model inferred from strontium isotope data assumes that most of the Ouki water was contributed by the Poop√≥ basin, another assumes a 69% contribution by waters from Lake Titicaca. Waters from the Poop√≥ basin would have spilled into the Uyuni/Coipasa basin. The drying of the lake left deposits containing amphibole, illite, plagioclase feldspar, potassium feldspar, kaolinite, pyroxene, quartz and smectite. = Dating = Various radiometric dates have been obtained for the Ouki paleolake from tufa, wood and fossils of Bulimulidae and Littoridina, mostly within the basin of Lake Poopo. There is noticeable disagreement between radiometric dates obtained by uranium-thorium dating and dates obtained by radiocarbon dating. The former yield ages ranging between 120,000 and 98,000 years ago. The latter produce ages between 45,200 and 28,200 years ago. Radiocarbon dates of such old samples can easily suffer from contamination by modern carbon, creating spuriously young ages. The uranium-thorium dates range between 96,740 ¬±5,560 and 125,990 ¬± 9,580 years ago. The exact lake level history is poorly known, but between 115,000 and 100,000 years ago, the water was higher than . Some lake level changes coincide with cold periods in the North Atlantic, and the Ouki stage has been considered synchronous with marine isotope stage 5. Alternatively, if radiocarbon dates of 44,609 ¬± 927 to 33,422 ¬± 1937 are attributed to Ouki, sediments in the Uyuni basin attributed to Lake Minchin would instead belong to Ouki.  Context  Its formation may have been caused by an increase of precipitation, and may be further associated with changes in the position of the ITCZ and La Nina-like conditions. The increase of precipitation may have amounted to 50‚Äì100%. The Ouki lake cycle occurred during a major glaciation that may also be recorded from moraine deposits in the southern Puna, as well as at a time of low summer insolation in the southern hemisphere but with a southward expansion of the South American monsoon. Lake levels in Lake Huinaymarca, the southern basin of Lake Tauca, were low during the Ouki period. Sediments in the Majes River valley indicate humid conditions during the Ouki period, as do lake level records in the Atacama. The humid period in Peru during the Ouki phase may be associated with several large landslides (such as the Chuquibamba landslide complex) which have been identified there, and the accumulation of sediments in the Pativilca valley.  Controversy  The existence of this lake was questioned in 2011, based on the lack of evidence for such a lake in drill cores of Salar de Uyuni. It is unknown whether the Poop√≥ basin lake extended to the Uyuni/Coipasa basins as well. The sill separating the Poop√≥ and Uyuni/Coipasa basins may not have been breached until 80,000‚Äì60,000 years ago. In 2013, it was suggested that the \\"L4\\" lacustrine stage, which has been identified in drill cores taken from Salar de Uyuni, may be the Ouki/Salinas lake phase.

The park was created in 1933 by public subscription to honour Alexander Muir, who composed the song \\"The Maple Leaf Forever\\". The park was originally located opposite Mount Pleasant Cemetery on Yonge Street, but was moved to its present location in 1951 due to the construction of the Yonge subway. Today the park is in Toronto's Lawrence Park neighbourhood south of Lawrence Avenue with an entrance on the east side of Yonge Street. History Gate and monument (background) located opposite Mount Pleasant Cemetery in 1935. Alexander Muir Memorial Gardens was founded in 1933 but was originally located on the west side of Yonge Street across from Mount Pleasant Cemetery, where Muir is buried. Landscape architect Edwin Kay designed the original park using the maple leaf as a theme. The park was to celebrate Toronto's centennial in 1934 as well as to honour Muir. The park's creation was supported by public subscriptions. To make room for the construction of the Davisville subway yard, the Toronto Transportation Commission moved the park, including its stone walls and plants, to its current location starting in 1951. The cost of the move was over (). The park at its present location was formally dedicated on May 28, 1952. Edwin Kay's formal, symmetrical design was replicated at the new location. The subway tunnel portal at the south end of the Davisville Yard is called the Muir Portal because of the park that used to be there. In 1990, an international jury declared Alexander Muir Memorial Gardens to be one of the best 25 urban design projects built before 1985 in Toronto. Park features Monument to Alexander Muir within the Gardens. Alexander Muir Memorial Gardens feature formal flower gardens with roses, herbs and multi-tiered beds. There is a decorative gate at the Yonge Street entrance bearing a plaque depicting a maple leaf to commemorate Muir and the park's 1952 reopening. Inside the park, there is a stone retaining wall that is also a monument dedicated to Muir inscribed with the refrain of The Maple Leaf Forever. The Gardens contain stone balconies and steps, crushed brick pathways and sunken gardens enclosed by maple, willow and oak trees. The park is popular for wedding photography. Alexander Muir Memorial Gardens is part of a chain of parks leading eastwards along Blythwood Ravine Park, Sherwood Park and Sunnydene Park to Bayview Avenue. The Gardens are part of the self-guided tour: Northern Ravines & Gardens Discovery Walk. On the south side of the Gardens, Alexander Muir Road descends into Blythwood Ravine to serve Lawrence Park Lawn Bowling & Croquet Club. The Toronto Legacy Project and Heritage Toronto erected a plaque in honour of astronomer Helen Sawyer Hogg at the extreme south-west corner of the park. Between 1962 and 1965, Hogg lived in the apartment building at 2875 Yonge Street which is adjacent to the park.

Personal life and studies  Khorchide was raised in Saudi Arabia where his Palestinian family had fled to. At the age of 18 he emigrated to Vienna, Austria. There, he studied Sociology and soon became citizen of Austria. Parallel to his studies in Austria, Khorchide made Islamic studies in Beirut. 2006-2010 he worked at the University of Vienna in the fields of Islamic studies and Islamic pedagogy. Parallel to this he was Imam of a mosque near Vienna. In 2010 Khorchide became Professor at the University of M√ºnster in Germany, at the Centre for Islamic Theology (CIT).  Research  The central tenet of Khorchide's teachings is that at the heart of Islam there is mercy, not blind obedience to traditions or even violence. For Khorchide, true Islam has no contradiction to the ideals of humanism as known in the Western world. He reads the Quran as a text from the 7th century and rejects to transfer its moral teachings directly to the 21st century. Khorchide wants to read Quran and Hadith by applying the historical-critical method. According to him, this will not harm the real message of Islam but will support a better understanding of Islam. With his approach, Khorchide attracted international attention. The New York Times wrote about him, and delegations from Islamic countries visit M√ºnster in order to get to know more about his approach of Islamic theology. In 2016, the Grand Imam of al-Azhar Ahmed el-Tayeb, who is considered by some Muslims to be the highest authority in Sunni Islam, came to M√ºnster and talked with Mouhanad Khorchide. The big Muslim associations in Germany reject Khorchide's approach, or at least look at it with much suspicion. Khorchide received death threats which is why he is living under the protection of the police. Mouhanad Khorchide is one of the founders of the Muslimisches Forum Deutschland, i.e. Muslim Forum Germany of liberal Muslims and non-Muslims.

As a follow-on to the , the J3 class incorporated all the lessons learned from the First World War, specifically the battle of Jutland. The design was seen as an improvement to the Admiral class by virtue of its heavier and improved armouring scheme, specifically the deck armour, although the offensive armament remained roughly the same.Brown, p. 134 The design was superseded by the I3 and G3 battlecruiser designs, as both mounted a heavier main armament, and further improved the protection scheme, on roughly the same tonnage. The 1921 fleet program was cancelled due to signing of the Washington Naval Treaty in 1922, which limited the size and armament of battleships to and no gun bigger than . Background In 1916 the US had declared its intention to create a Navy \\"second to none\\"; Congress had authorized the building of a large number of battleships and battlecruisers. In response, the Japanese government also began a large programme of warship building (the 8-8 fleet). Two improved hulls were rebuilt into the two s by the Royal Navy during the war. The only new capital ships laid down during the war were the s. Their design had been called into question after the Battle of Jutland in 1916, and three ships of this class were cancelled, leaving only to be completed to a modified design.Campbell, Part 1, p. 4 The US plan had been delayed by the wartime need to build smaller vessels. Nevertheless, estimates by the Admiralty were that by the early 1920s the Royal Navy would be behind in ships. By the beginning of 1920 the Americans had completed one battleship since the end of World War I and had five more building. Seven more were intended to be laid down in 1920‚Äì21, six of which were the very large and powerful , armed with twelve 16-inch guns.Friedman, pp. 420, 446 The Japanese had finished one battleship since the end of the war and had three more under construction. To respond to this state of affairs, the Admiralty initially planned to build three battleships and one battlecruiser in the fiscal year 1921‚Äì22 and again in 1922‚Äì23, but this was changed to four battlecruisers to be built first, presumably to be followed by the same number of battleships the following year. The British did have access to German technology through ships such as the battleship which had been saved from the scuttling of the interned German High Seas Fleet in Scapa Flow and the experiences of the war. A committee concluded that any new ship should be able to match the speed of the new US s, expected to make 32 knots. Consequently, a series of designs was prepared of ships with displacements ranging from , the only limitations being the ability to use British dockyards and passage through the Suez Canal. These designs were given letters of the alphabet running backwards from K to G. The related battleship designs under consideration at the same time had design letters from L upwards.Campbell, Part 2, p. 13 The first two design proposals, 'K2' and 'K3', had a general layout similar to Hood, but were armed with either eight or nine 18-inch guns, in four twin or three triple gun turrets, respectively. The numeral in the designation came from the number of guns in each turret. These ships were very large, displacing , could only reach , and could only be docked in a single ex-German floating dock, and one dock, Gladstone Dock in Liverpool. The 'J3', the next proposal, saved nearly by reducing the main armament to nine 50-calibres long guns and the main deck armour to . Total armour was less than Hood but with increased power was expected to reach 32 kn. This reduction in size allowed the ship to dock anywhere that Hood could, and to pass through the Suez and Panama Canals. The configuration was considered poorly armoured and a more compact design I3 - with machinery aft, magazines centrally disposed and the main armament forward -was drawn up by the DNC and presented in late 1920. A variation of I3, the G3 design, with reduced gun calibre and thinner armour over machinery was tendered as a means to reduce weight and hence increase speed.Friedman p211 General characteristics The J3 battlecruisers were of very similar size to the Admiral class. They had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. They would have displaced normally and at deep load, over more than the older ships. The main benefit of the design was a reduction in the weight of the main armament but increase in firepower by converting from twin to triple mount turrets, with the additional weight savings being used to improve protection and armouring. =Propulsion= The J3 battlecruiser design had four geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, and arranged in two engine rooms. The forward engine room held the two turbines for the wing shafts, while the aft engine room contained the turbine for the port and starboard inner shafts. The turbines were powered by 18 Yarrow small- tube boilers divided between nine boiler rooms. They were designed to produce a total of at a working pressure of and temperature of with superheat. Maximum speed would have been .Campbell, pt. 4, p. 44 =Armament= Housing the main armament in triple turrets was new to the Royal Navy, though British companies had been involved in the production of triple gun turret designs for other navies.Campbell, Part 1, p. 9 The choice of a high muzzle velocity with a lighter shell was taken from the German practice; it ran counter to previous British guns such as the BL 15-inch Mark I gun of 42-calibre length, which were lower-muzzle-velocity weapons firing heavy shells.Campbell, Part 1, p. 7 The J3 design mounted nine 15-inch 50-calibre guns in three triple hydraulically powered Mark I gun turrets, designated 'A', 'B', and 'Z' from front to rear. The guns could be depressed to ‚àí3¬∞ and elevated to 40¬∞. The ships' maximum stowage was 116 shells per gun.Raven and Roberts, pp. 98, 100 They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of . Their maximum range was about at maximum elevation. These weapons would have been very similar in construction to the BL 16-inch Mark I produced for the Nelson class battleships. The J3s carried a secondary armament of 12 BL 6-inch Mark XXII guns in twin turrets instead of casemates. the six turrets were sited amidships behind the main bridge structure and ahead of the Z turret. The guns could elevate between ‚Äì5¬∞ and +60¬∞. An anti-aircraft battery of six QF 4.7-inch Mark VIII guns was included. They had a maximum depression of -5¬∞ and a maximum elevation of 90¬∞. They fired a high explosive shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of eight to twelve rounds per minute. The guns had a maximum anti-aircraft ceiling of , and effective range of 16,160 yards (14,780 m). A maximum of 256 rounds per gun could be carried.Campbell, Part 3, p. 42 The ships were intended to carry four 8-barreled mountings for the QF 2-pounder Mark VIII gun (commonly known as a \\"pom-pom\\"), two abaft the funnels and two at the stern. Each barrel was provided with 1,300 rounds of ammunition. The gun fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of to a distance of . The gun's rate of fire was nearly 100 rounds per minute. =Fire-control= The main guns of the J3 battlecruisers could be controlled from any of the three director-control towers (DCT). The primary DCT was mounted at the top of the forward superstructure. Another was mounted on the roof of the conning tower in an armoured hood, and the third was aft. Each main gun turret was provided with a coincidence rangefinder in an armoured housing on the turret roof. The secondary armament was primarily controlled by three DCTs. Two mounted on each side of the bridge and the third was located aft of the secondary armament. The anti-aircraft guns were controlled by a high-angle control system mounted on the very top of the forward superstructure. Each \\"pom-pom\\" mount had its own director and there was also a height-finder aft. Two torpedo rangefinders were located on the sides of the funnels. =Armour= The J3 was armoured similarly to the Hood, with bands of varying thickness. The armour was angled to up to 25 degrees on the belt, to increase relative thickness. One of the considerations that led to the cancellation of the J3 design was that the protection scheme did not use an \\"all or nothing\\" layout as later designs, such as the G3; this led to the J3 wasting tonnage on armour that would not have withstood incoming fire, a situation that the Admiralty found unacceptable.Brown, p. 75 Notes  References    Category:Battlecruisers of the Royal Navy Category:Proposed ships of the Royal Navy ","title":"J3 Class battlecruiser"},{"id":"51907830","text":"Neffe means nephew in German.

Built about 1907 by a French Canadian immigrant, they are among the only buildings of their type to survive the city's urban redevelopment efforts of the late 20th century. They were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. Description and history The Dumas Tenements are located west of downtown Winooski and its historic mill complex. West Allen and West Canal Streets both run east‚Äìwest from the downtown area, between the Winooski River to the south and railroad tracks to the north. The two buildings are identical in basic structure, and are set back-to-back, the northern one (on West Allen Street) facing West Allen Park and the southern one facing a former industrial site that is now residential. Both are two-story wood frame structures with flat roofs that have extended eaves with paired Italianate brackets. The walls of one are finished in wooden clapboards, while the other has been resided in vinyl. Each houses four residential units, two on each floor, which are accessed through entrances at the center of the street-facing facade. The entrances are sheltered by two-story porches, and provide access to central stairwells that retain some original features. with The two buildings were constructed about 1907 by John Dumas, a French Canadian immigrant who purchased a single lot from the Burlington Flour Company in that year, conditioned on his construction of multi-unit housing. Four-unit wood-frame buildings of this type were not unusual in the districts of Winooski where worker housing was constructed. Many such buildings were demolished by the city during urban renewal projects of the 1970s and 2000s, and these are among the few that have survived.

History  By 1430 a church with this name already existed in Alcamo, under the patronage of the Liotta family. In 1558, Nicol√≤ di Gregorio, a member of the Liotta, authorized Pietro Mastrandrea, the Rector of the Confraternity of Bianchi, to demolish the ancient Church and build the present one.Carlo Cataldo, Guida storico- artistica dei beni culturali di Alcamo-Calatafimi-Castellammare Golfo p.61, Alcamo, Sarograf, 1982. Since 1896, after the dissolution of the Company, the Church hosted the seat of Monte di Prestiti \\"Filippi\\" (banking house) from the Congregation of Charity, that destroyed the altar in order to put a safe there. Deconsacrated since the middle of last century, today the Church is the seat of URP (Public Information Office) and the Tourist office.  Description and works  The facade has some archaic elements, including a double lancet window ending with a denticulate cornice; it was completed and designed by Girolamo Vicchiuzzo, an architect and carver from Palermo. During the last century, a fake balcony was added; a finely carved small column stands at the corner of the fa√ßade. The interior has a single nave with two bays and a crossed vault: the former main altarpiece, now lost, depicted San Nicola di Bari painted in 1599 by Narciso Guidone, a painter from Trapani.Carlo Cataldo, La conchiglia di S.Giacomo p.85,108,134, Alcamo, Campo, 2001  Confraternity  Originally it was called Confraternity of Mercy and the Most Holy Crucifix, or the Mount of the Most Holy Charity: its founder was the nobleman Pietro Mastrandrea; after his death the Confraternity had the patronage on the Church, given by Nicolangelo de Gregorio in 1567. Afterwards it was called Compagnia dei Bianchi and was aggregated to the Arciconfraternity of San Giovanni Decollato, Rome ]; its brethren belonged to nobility and they wore ‚Äúa white sackcloth and visors‚Äù with the emblem of the Most Holy Crucifix on their shoulders. The Company had the following scopes and duties: * Visiting the poor prisoners, striving for their release with the financial support of people too. * Protecting the confessed criminals, comforting them before death, and bringing them to the burial place on their shoulders. * Burying poor people, accompanying them with some priests. * Visiting the poor sick people who were in hospital, helping them during meals and serving them with a spirit of charity. The historian Ignazio de Blasi also speaks about the duty to help the poor sick people and look for a free burial place for them; in 1820 some of these possibilities were revoked to companies, and later, in 1898, they were definitely abolished by law. The financial incomes of this Company were assigned to the families of prisoners and to ex-convicts as benefits.

Those human relationships then feed back into the factors which then shape dynamics of the actual city itself. With numerous inputs and outputs, this study is a constantly evolving field. Cities are more than just a dot on the map or a set of buildings. Alcaeus, a Greek poet, wrote about cities \\"not the house finely roofed or the stones of walls well builded, nay, nor canals, and dockyards make the city, but men able to use their opportunity\\".Pahl, R. E. (2013). \\"A perspective on urban sociology\\". Readings in Urban Sociology: Readings in Sociology, 3. Cities have also been described as prisms in which one can see the social, economic, and geographical characteristics from which they evolved. Urban centers not only have a disproportionate percentage of the population, but also have a large amount of fixed assets, capital, labor resources, and productive capacity.Bourne, L. S., & Ley, D. F. (1993). Changing social geography of Canadian cities (Vol. 2). McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP. Areas ;Social dynamics :The confines of a city often force various social and ethnic groups to live within close proximity of one another. Societies are defined as a collective sense of individuals and the relationships they form.Del Casino Jr, V. (2009). Social geography: a critical introduction. John Wiley & Sons. Within societies, individuals help to distinguish from one another based on social identities. Often, these social identity differences can result in conflict or in a group attempting to separate from the rest of society. London is one of the most diverse cities in the world,Helena Horton, \\"This map perfectly displays the diversity of London\\", Daily Telegraph, 12 October 2015 where a single street can have restaurants from more than 30 countries, from a vast range of cultures.Knox, P., & Pinch, S. (2014). Urban social geography: an introduction. Routledge. In such a dense distribution, conflict may arise. Another prime example of this is Kurdistan. Though the Kurds do not officially have a country of their own, they govern themselves and see themselves as very different from the Turks and Iraqis that surround them. ;Economics :In the age of the Industrial Revolution, many populations shifted from rural, agrarian based into the urban areas. Later in the twentieth century, as manufacturing started to leave urban areas, such as happened in Detroit, this acted as a force of change within urban households. Prior to, a single paycheck could often support a household. After manufacturing shifts, a household often had to shift to a dual-income where both parents have to work to support the family. As an example of the effect this creates, there is then a greater demand for child care in that urban area.Knox, P., & Pinch, S. (2014). Urban social geography: an introduction. Routledge. While some families will stick in the area and change their lifestyles to acclimate, some will choose to leave for greener pastures. As families start to leave urban areas, neighborhoods will either become abandoned or to slowly wither in terms of economic status. This changing of the economy often results in a rise in crime and in deterioration of the physical neighborhoods. As those property values decline, eventually this leads to gentrification where individuals from outside the urban area will move in and fix up the neighborhood. This process will then force property values up and possibly force longstanding residents to move on. ;Conflict :In the relative close confines of a city, differences resulting from political, social, and economic differences can result in conflict amongst competing groups. Conflicts in urban areas are intensified because they are often such an extreme intersection of conflicting ideologies. With the close confines of urban areas, conflicts here often result in the greatest number of fatalities and amounts of property destruction, population displacement, and as a result stress on emergency infrastructure.Garba, S. B. (2016). \\"Population Growth, Governance and Urban Social Conflicts in Africa\\" in Population Growth and Rapid Urbanization in the Developing World, 210-230. Prime examples of these conflicts have been seen recently in South Africa, Liberia, Sudan and Burundi. ;Social media :In the advent of the social media age, there has been a tremendous effect on the way which people interact with one another and the choices they make in their daily lives. Traditions depend on culture, however very often individuals will enter into relationships with those who may be within their neighborhood or those whom cross their paths during their daily routine. The advent of social media has changed that dynamic. No longer are individuals limited to relationships with those in their immediate surroundings. Very often, now, individuals are meeting across long distances via social media. When a relationship progresses, these individuals can choose to live with one another. Thus a person from a different culture, and how has different experiences is injected into a new urban environment. Thus feeding into the changing dynamics of the area. Social media is also used as a means to study the activity patterns of urban dwellers. The immense amount of geo-location available, from social media applications, has opened up a whole new method of study. People's geolocation data is helping to feed the study of the activity choices, and to offer insight into how groups of certain types choose particular neighborhoods that fit their interests. Behavioral analysis has opened up ways to hook into lifestyle patterns and their interconnections within transportation science, travel patterns, workplace location choice, restaurant choice, retail establishment type, vehicle ownership, and income levels.Hasan, S., & Ukkusuri, S. V. (2015). \\"Location contexts of user check-ins to model urban geo life-style patterns\\". PLoS ONE, 10(5), e0124819.

She was sold cheaply as a yearling but developed into a top-class specialist sprinter who excelled on soft ground. Trained in Yorkshire by Tim Easterby, she was highly tried throughout her racing career, running thirty seven times between April 1998 and October 2001. She showed very good form as a juvenile in 1998, winning the Two-Year-Old Trophy after finishing second in both the Queen Mary Stakes and the Cherry Hinton Stakes. In the following year she won the Great St. Wilfrid Stakes and the Wentworth Stakes as well as finishing placed in several other good sprint races. She reached her peak as a four-year-old in 2000 when she won the Palace House Stakes and the Cecil Frail Stakes before recording her biggest win in the Group One Stanley Leisure Sprint Cup. In the same year she finished third in the July Cup, Nunthorpe Stakes and Prix de l'Abbaye. Pipalong failed to reproduce her best form in 2001 but did win the Duke of York Stakes and again finished third in the Prix de l'Abbaye. After her retirement from racing she became a broodmare and had some success as a dam of winners. Background Pipalong is a bay mare with a narrow white blaze bred in Ireland by the County Kildare-based Yeomanstown Stud. She was the most successful horse sired by Pips Pride, who recorded his biggest win in the Phoenix Stakes. Her dam Limpopo showed little ability, failing to win in five races. She was distantly descended from the British broodmare Merry Devon, whose other descendants have included Jeune and Lord At War. In October 1997 the yearling filly was consigned to the Tattersalls sale and was sold for 7,000 guineas. Throughout her racing year she was owned by Tom Bennett in partnership with Marjorie Easterby and trained in North Yorkshire by Marjorie's son Tim Easterby at his Habton Grange stable. In her first two seasons of racing Pipalong was ridden in all but one of her races by Lindsay Charnock. Racing career =1998: two-year-old season= Pipalong began her racing career in a five furlong maiden race at Ripon Racecourse on 16 April and starting at odds of 5/1 in a thirteen-runner field. Running on soft ground she took the lead at half way and won by twelve lengths from College Music despite being eased down by Charnock in the final strides. In the following month she started favourite for a race over the same distance at York Racecourse and won by a neck from the Mick Channon-trained Bint Allayl. Kieren Fallon took the ride when Pipalong moved up in class to contest the Group Three Queen Mary Stakes at Royal Ascot in June. She recovered from a slow start to finish strongly but was beaten two lengths into second place by Bint Allayl. Charnock resumed the mount in the six furlong Cherry Hinton Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in July in which the filly set the early pace before finishing second of the ten runners behind Wannabe Grand. After a break of almost three months, Pipalong returned in the Oh So Sharp Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket and finished fourth behind Snittersby, Fragrant Oasis and Hula Angel (later to win the Irish 1000 Guineas). On 17 October Pipalong started 5/2 favourite in a 22-runner field for the Listed Comcast Teesside Two-Year-Old Trophy over six furlongs on heavy ground at Redcar Racecourse. She was among the leaders from the start, went to the front in the last quarter mile, and rallied after being headed by the colt Pistachio to regain the lead in the closing stages to win by a neck. =1999: three-year-old season= Pipalong failed to win in her first seven starts as a three-year-old but ran consistently in good sprint races. In spring she finished fourth in the Thirsk Classic Trial and the Shergar Cup Sprint and then ran fifth in the Chartwell Fillies' Stakes. She then finished second when favourite for the Cecil Frail Stakes, fourth in a handicap race at Doncaster, second to Imperial Beauty in the Summer Stakes and fourth in the Queensferry Stakes. On 14 August at Ripon on soft ground the filly was matched against colts and older horses in the Great St Wilfrid Handicap and was assigned a weight of 131 pounds in a 23-runner field. The filly started slowly but began to make rapid progress in the last quarter mile. She caught the colt Bon Ami in the final stride and won by a short head. Tim Easterby commented \\"It never occurred to me that she hadn't trained on. She has worked just as well, if not better, this year than she did last season. We decided to run her here instead of having a crack at the Nunthorpe, and even though she had a lot of weight back in a handicap, I was very hopeful. I felt she had just come right, and she loves this ground\\". Eight days after her win at Redcar, Pipalong finished second to Wannebe Grand in the Flying Fillies' Stakes at Pontefract. She was then moved up to Group One level for the first time when she contested the Stanley Leisure Sprint Cup over six furlongs at Haydock. She started a 25/1 outsider and finished unplaced behind Diktat. She then finished fifth under a weight of 124 pounds in the Ayr Gold Cup before finishing second to Gaelic Storm in the Bentinck Stakes at Newmarket in October. On her final start of the season the filly started second favourite behind Gaelic Storm in the Listed Wentworth Stakes on soft ground at Doncaster on 6 November with the other 18 runners including Superior Premium (Stewards' Cup) and Muqtarib (Richmond Stakes). She was among the leaders from the start and stayed on in the closing stages to take the lead on the line and win by a short head from Two Clubs. =2000: four-year-old season= After Charnock's retirement at the end of 1999 Kevin Darley took over the ride on Pipalong and partnered her in all but one of her subsequent races. On her seasonal debut she started odds-on favourite for a minor race over six furlongs at Thirsk and won by three and a half lengths from her stablemate Hot Tin Roof. She was then stepped up in class and started at odds of 9/1 in a 21-runner field for the Group Three Palace House Stakes over five furlongs at Newmarket on 6 May. The Mill Reef Stakes winner Arkadian Hero headed the betting market whilst the other contenders included Kier Park (Cornwallis Stakes), Bishops Court (Prix du Petit Couvert), Superior Premium, The Tatling, Rambling Bear (King George Stakes), Bolshoi (King's Stand Stakes) and Halmahera (Cornwallis Stakes). After racing prominently from the start, Pipalong took the lead in the final furlong and won by a neck and half a length from Kier Park and Rambling Bear in a blanket finish which saw the first nine finishers covered by three and a half lengths. After the race Tim Easterby said \\"She's a star-that was tremendous. She'll be sprint queen this year. The plan was to go to York for the Duke of York, but she had been working so well I thought I'd let her take her chance here. Six furlongs and soft ground would suit her better\\". Twelve days after her win at Newmarket Pipalong was moved back up in distance for the six-furlong Duke of York Stakes at York and finished second of the ten runners beaten one and a half lengths by the five-year-old Lend A Hand. In the Listed Cecil Frail Stakes, for fillies and mares at Haydock on 10 June, Pipalong started odds-on favourite against five younger opponents. Ridden for the first and only time by Michael Roberts she overtook the front-running Romanylei in the final furlong and won \\"readily\\" by half a length. Racing on firm ground at Royal Ascot, Pipalong made little impact in the Cork and Orrery Stakes, finishing unplaced behind Superior Premium. In the Group One July Cup on good-to-soft ground at Newmarket she produced a much better performance as she was narrowly beaten in a three-way photo finish by the Japanese colt Agnes World and the three-year- old Lincoln Dancer with Primo Valentino and Lend A Hand in fourth and fifth. Pipalong produced another good effort in the Nunthorpe Stakes at York in August when she finished third behind Nuclear Debate and Bertolini. The six- furlong Stanley Leisure Sprint Cup at Haydock on 6 September saw Pipalong start the 3/1 second favourite behind Lincoln Dancer for a race run on heavy ground. The best-fancied of the other eleven runners were Sampower Star (Prix de Saint-Georges), Bold Edge (Prix Maurice de Gheest), Tomba (Prix de la For√™t), Vision of Night (Prix de Meautry) and Auenklang (Prix Robert Papin). After tracking the leaders in the early stages, Darley sent Pipalong into the lead approaching the final furlong and the filly kept on well to land the Group One prize by three quarters of a length from Sampower Star, with Tomba a length away in third. Peter Easterby representing his son Tim said \\"I can't remember how much this filly cost but it wasn't much. My wife has a half share. Pipalong has had some hard races, but always comes back for more. If anything she hit the front a bit too soon today, but it's always hard to come from behind on this sort of ground\\" whilst Darley commented \\"She deserved that and did everything right today. That's my first Group One winner of the year. It's nice to do it on a filly I've been associated with all year\\". On her final appearance of the season, Pipalong was sent to France for the Prix de l'Abbaye over 1000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in October and finished third behind Namid and Superstar Leo. =2001: five-year-old season= In March 2001 Pipalong was sent to the United Arab Emirates for the Dubai Golden Shaheen but finished tenth of the fifteen runners behind the American gelding Caller One. On her return to Europe she attempted to repeat her 2000 success in the Palace House Stakes but ran unplaced behind Rushcutter Bay. On 17 May Pipalong started a 14/1 outsider in her second attempt to win the Duke of York Stakes. Bertolini started favourite ahead of Astonished with Bahamian Pirate, Vision of Night and Hot Tin Roof also among the fourteen-runner field. The mare produced what was described as a \\"cracking effort\\", taking the lead approaching the final furlong and holding off the sustained challenge of Tedburrow to win by a neck. Following the race Tim Easterby said \\"She's a star! She liked the weather in Dubai but she didn't like he track ‚Äì there was too much sand and it was too firm\\".

Fahrenthold (born 1978) is an American journalist who writes for The Washington Post and serves as a political analyst for NBC News and MSNBC. In 2017, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for his coverage of Donald Trump and his alleged charitable givings, including the 2016 United States presidential election. Early life and education Fahrenthold was born to Jeane and Peter Fahrenthold of Houston, Texas. His mother is a teacher at Bunker Hill Elementary School (Texas) and his father a director of risk management. He attended Memorial High School, where he wrote for the student newspaper, Anvil and was the captain of the 1996 academic challenge national championship team. Fahrenthold attended Harvard University, where he wrote for The Harvard Crimson student newspaper. He graduated magna cum laude in 2000 with a degree in history. Career Fahrenthold joined the staff of The Washington Post in 2000, where he has covered the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department, the U.S. Congress, and the federal government. He later covered the New England region and environmental issues for the Post before moving onto the political team in 2010. He was a CNN contributor from January 2017 to February 2018, when he became a political analyst for NBC News and MSNBC.  2016 presidential election  According to a 2018 study, Fahrentold was the third most frequently mentioned individual or organization in Twitter discussions about Trump during the 2016 election, behind Trump himself and CNN. =Reporting on Donald Trump donation claims and the Trump Foundation= Fahrenthold covered the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, reporting on the Donald J. Trump Foundation as well as claims Trump made as the 2016 Republican nominee that he had given away millions out of his own pocket. In May 2016, Fahrenthold began an effort to verify Trump had made these personal donations. To solicit leads and for transparency, he periodically posted updates to Twitter via a hand- written list of charities he had contacted to ask whether they had received contributions from Trump, as well as the charities' responses. After four months, Fahrenthold and colleagues at the Post had contacted more than 400 major charities, with only one charity confirming they had received a personal donation from Trump between 2008 and May 2016 when Fahrenthold began publicly reporting on the question. Following Fahrenthold's reporting, the New York attorney general opened an inquiry into the Trump Foundation's fundraising practices, and ultimately issued a \\"notice of violation\\" ordering the foundation to stop raising money in New York. The Poynter Institute described Fahrenthold as \\"one of the journalism stars of the 2016 campaign due to a string of revelations about Donald Trump's charitable giving (or lack of same)\\". CNN senior media correspondent Brian Stelter said: \\"Some have dubbed [Fahrenthold's work] Pulitzer worthy. Its impact was reinforced on Tuesday [September 13, 2016] when President Obama cited the reporting while stumping for Hillary Clinton.\\" On April 10, 2017, Fahrenthold won the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for his work on Donald Trump's charity claims casting \\"doubt on Donald Trump's assertions of generosity toward charities\\". =Reporting on the Trump Access Hollywood video= On October 7, 2016, Fahrenthold broke news of a 2005 Access Hollywood video recording Donald Trump making what Politico characterized as \\"lewd comments about groping women\\"; among other remarks, Trump said that his celebrity allowed him to \\"grab them by the pussy\\" without consequence. An unnamed source called Fahrenthold at 11 that morning and informed him of the tape's existence; at 4 that afternoon, Fahrenthold published the tape and a reported story on it in The Washington Post. The newspaper said it became \\"the most concurrently viewed article in the history of The Post‚Äôs website\\". The story broke two days before the second of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign debates between Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Staff at Access Hollywood, owned by NBC, had found the tape earlier in the week, and the show was working on a story but did not plan to run it until the following Monday, the day after the debate. Once Fahrenthold broke the story at the Post, both Access Hollywood and NBC News ran stories the same night. = Reporting on Secret Service payments to the Trump Organization = In August 2020, Fahrentold and other Washington Post reporters published an investigative journalism piece showing that the Secret Service spent more than $900,000 at properties owned by Trump during his presidency. After the reporting, White House spokesperson Judd Deere said the White House was building a \\"dossier\\" on Fahrentold. Personal life In 2005, Fahrenthold married Elizabeth Lewis; the two met while attending Harvard. Lewis' father is Harry R. Lewis, computer science professor and former dean of Harvard College. He is also president of the board at Roxbury Latin School. Lewis' mother is Marlyn McGrath Lewis, director of admissions for Harvard College.

In 1998, the reconstruction of the site of the Legislative Assembly of the City of Buenos Aires was announced. A few years before its restoration in 2001, the cafe closed and was abandoned.  Recovery  The restoration began in January 2001 and ended in June of the same year. It included the replacement of worn parts, columns and ceiling. Some parts were a complete replacement, with a different size, shape but maintaining the original colors. The facade was preserved in its entirety. Restoration was financed from the municipal budget.

History In the 1840s six French Jesuits from Lyons began proselytizing and educating the outlying settlements . By 1855 they were able to get into the capital. With the advent of King Radama II in 1861, Christians were free to preach. Thus, the Jesuits and the Sisters of St. Joseph of Cluny settled in the capital, and opened schools and churches. The internal life of the College survived the abolition of the European section (1906 to 1934). Then followed the start of secondary education (1935), the closing of Madagascar College (1942), and new programs: Philosophy (1952), Elementary Mathematics (1956), Experimental Sciences (1960) and the Baccalaureate (1955). Coeducation began with the first girls admitted in 1966. In 1983 the Higher Technical Institute (1983) opened on the premises. In 1986 the literature sector was restored. Its current enrollment included 2202 students:, 1340 Catholics, 799 Protestants, and 63 others; 2039 boys and 163 girls. Sports Saint-Michel has a swimming club with many good results.

The Irish went to Barbados, Jamaica and the Leeward Islands. Irish indentured servants were Irish people who became indentured servants in territories under the control of the British Empire, such as the British West Indies (particularly Barbados, Jamaica and the Leeward Islands), British North America and later Australia. Indentures agreed to provide up to seven years of labor in return for passage to the New World and food, housing, and shelter during their indenture. At the end of this period, their masters were legally required to grant them \\"freedom dues\\" in the form of either land or capital. An indentured servant's contract could be extended as punishment for breaking a law, such as running away, or in the case of female servants, becoming pregnant. Those transported unwillingly were not indentures. They were political prisoners, vagrants, or people who had been defined as \\"undesirable\\" by the English state. Penal transportation of Irish people was at its height during the 17th century, during the Cromwellian conquest and settlement of Ireland (1649‚Äì1653). During this period, thousands of Irish people were sent to the Caribbean, or \\"Barbadosed\\", against their will. Accessed 2018-10-31. Similar practices continued as late as the Victorian period, with Irish political prisoners sent to imperial British penal colonies in Australia.https://www.irishcentral.com/roots/history/fenian- convicts-transported-to-perth-remembered-by-their-descendants-in-festival Indentures and transportees have been conflated, though they were distinct.  Historical background  Like the movement of other European people to the Americas, Irish migration to the Caribbean and British North America had complex causes. The late sixteenth and early seventeenth century were a time of upheaval in Ireland, while English conquest and colonisation, resultant religious persecution, and crop failures (some as a deliberate result of the Tudor conquest of Ireland) drove many Irish people to seek a better life, or survival, elsewhere. Like their English and Scottish counterparts, Irish people were active participants in the \\"rush for American colonies\\" during the early seventeenth century. Most travelled to the New World as indentured servants, but others were merchants and landholders who were key players in a variety of different trade and settlement enterprises. A modern Protestant mural in Belfast celebrating Oliver Cromwell and his activities. It was before and after the Cromwellian conquest that Irish indentured servitude boomed. Many of the Irish laborers who travelled across the Atlantic from the 1620s did so by choice. However, convict labor had been used in English colonies since the early 1600s, and the forceful transportation of \\"undesirables\\" from Ireland to the West Indies had begun under Charles I. The practice took place on a much larger scale during the rule of Oliver Cromwell in the years 1649‚Äì58. In the ensuing conquest of Ireland, many prisoners were forcibly sent to the Caribbean islands, particularly to Barbados. Some of the first Irish people to travel to the New World did so as members of the Spanish garrison in Florida during the 1560s, and small numbers of Irish colonists were involved in efforts to establish colonies in the Amazon region, in Newfoundland, and in Virginia between 1604 and the 1630s. According to historian Donald Akenson, there were \\"few if any\\" Irish being forcibly transported to the New World during this period. Widespread use of forced transportation by the English state did not take place until the 1650s. Significant numbers of Irish laborers began traveling to colonies such as Virginia, the Leeward Islands, and Barbados in the 1620s. Between 1627 and 1660, laborers from Ireland and Britain crossed the Atlantic in large numbers, with as many as 60 to 65 percent of seventeenth-century migrants being indentured servants. By 1640, large numbers of Irish settlers were present in the West Indies, making up more than half the population of the region by some estimates. Most were indentured laborers, small farmers, or artisans. The type of labor being used in American colonies shifted dramatically after 1642, as the Irish Rebellion of 1641, the Irish Confederate Wars, and the Wars of the Three Kingdoms led to a reduction in the number of voluntary migrants, while growing numbers of prisoners of war, political prisoners, felons, and other \\"undesirables\\" were sent to labor in the colonies against their will. After the Siege of Drogheda, for example, Cromwell ordered most of the Irish military prisoners who surrendered to be shipped to Barbados. In 1654, the governors of several Irish counties were ordered to arrest \\"all wanderers, men and women, and such other Irish within their precincts as should not prove they had such a settled course of industry as yielded them a means of their own to maintain them, all such children as were in hospitals or workhouses, all prisoners, men and women, to be transported to the West Indies.\\"  Barbados  George Ayscue, an English Governor of Barbados. He conquered Barbados for the Cromwellian forces in 1651. Servants who arrived in Barbados between 1640 and 1660 arrived at a time of great change, when the colony was transitioning from tobacco and cotton cultivation to sugar. The resulting \\"sugar boom\\" created a massive demand for labor, which prompted a gradual shift from white servant to black slave labor. In 1638, the population of Barbados was about 6,000, with 2,000 of that number being indentured servants and 200 being African slaves. Fifteen years later, the Islands slave population had grown to 20,000, while indentured servants numbered 8,000. There were also more than 1,000 Irish freemen (former indentured servants whose term had expired) living on the island at that time. By 1660, there were 26,200 Europeans and 27,100 African slaves on the Island.Betty Wood, The Origins of American Slavery: Freedom and Bondage in the English Colonies (New York: Hill and Wang, 1997. During the initial stages of sugar production, white servants sometimes found themselves working side-by-side with black slaves, and according to historian James Dunn, they \\"became wild and unruly in the extreme\\" during this period. By the mid-1650s, however, white servants and black slaves no longer worked side-by- side, and by the mid-1660s, white servants were used only in skilled or supervisory roles. Irish servants on Barbados were often treated poorly, and Barbadian planters gained a reputation for cruelty. The decreased appeal of an indenture on Barbados, combined with enormous demand for labor caused by sugar cultivation, led the use of involuntary transportation to Barbados as a punishment for crimes, or for political prisoners, and also to the kidnapping of laborers who were sent to Barbados involuntarily. Irish indentured servants were a significant portion of the population throughout the period when white servants were used for plantation labor in Barbados, and while a \\"steady stream\\" of Irish servants entered the Barbados throughout the seventeenth century, Cromwellian efforts to pacify Ireland created a \\"veritable tidal wave\\" of Irish laborers who were sent to Barbados during the 1650s. Due to inadequate historical records, the total number of Irish laborers sent to Barbados is unknown, and estimates have been \\"highly contentious.\\" While one historical source estimated that as many as 50,000 Irish people were transported to either Barbados or Virginia unwillingly during the 1650s, this estimate is \\"quite likely exaggerated.\\" Another estimate that 12,000 Irish prisoners had arrived in Barbados by 1655 has been described as \\"probably exaggerated\\" by historian Richard B. Sheridan. According to historian Thomas Bartlett, it is \\"generally accepted\\" that approximately 10,000 Irish were sent to the West Indies involuntarily, and approximately 40,000 came as voluntary indentured servants, while many also traveled as voluntary, un-indentured emigrants.Bartlett, Thomas. \\"‚ÄòThis famous island set in a Virginian sea‚Äô: Ireland in the British Empire, 1690‚Äì1801.\\" In The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume II: The Eighteenth Century, by Marshall, P. J., Alaine Low, and Wm. Roger Louis., edited by P.J. Marshall, and Alaine Low. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998.  Leeward Islands  Irish people also made up a sizable portion of the Leeward Islands (Antigua, Montserrat, Nevis, and St Kitts) during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.Natalie A. Zacek, Settler Society in the English Leeward Islands, 1670‚Äì1776, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010 Many of these Irish were either indentured servants or former servants, and many of them lived \\"materially impoverished\\" lives; however, the Leeward Islands were also home to more affluent Irish, who were members of powerful merchant families and had numerous servants themselves. Unlike Barbados, the Irish population of Montserrat was primarily made up of individuals who had been \\"recruited to emigrate\\" by the islands' elite residents (who were often Irish themselves), rather than vagrants or convicts, and some of them had arrived as free laborers rather than as indentured servants.  Treatment  Once indentured, these servants had little control over their destination, as their contracts were sold to local planters on arrival. Ships were often overcrowded, and the mortality rate on voyages could be high: one ship which arrived at Barbados in 1638 had lost eighty of its 350 passengers (23%) to sickness by the time it arrived. In Barbados, indenture terms of four or five years were common, but those who arrived as prisoners were sometimes sentenced to ten years' indenture. While all indentured servants were treated harshly, Irish Catholics were also subject to English settlers' \\"sense of cultural and religious superiority\\" and considered to be \\"naturally inferior.\\" According to historian Jenny Shaw, the Irish people's Catholicism and distinct customs \\"marked the island's population as fundamentally apart from English civilization\\". English authorities used this perceived difference \\"to justify the poor treatment of the Irish Catholics they colonized,\\" as well as to lay claim to Ireland itself.Jenny Shaw, Everyday Life in the Early English Caribbean: Irish, Africans, and the Construction of Difference (Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2013). Masters and government authorities were often suspicious of Irish servants, and sometimes targeted them with special restrictions. Legislators in Nevis, for example, passed an act to prevent \\"papists\\" from settling on the island or holding public office in 1701 ‚Äì which was later repealed ‚Äì while Montserrat also considered similar legislation to exclude Irish from public and militia positions. Authorities in Barbados did not place similar restrictions, but did require Irish people to take an oath of abjuration before voting or holding office. After suspecting that Irish laborers had been involved in a 1692 slave revolt, Barbadian authorities wrote to the crown in 1697, asking them not to send further \\"Irish rebels\\" to the colony, \\"for we want not labourers of that colour to work for us, but men in whom we may confide, to strengthen us.\\"Hilary McD. Beckles, \\"The 'Hub of Empire:' The Caribbean and Britain in the Seventeenth Century\\". In Nicholas Canny and Roger Louis, eds., The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume 1 : Origins of Empire: British Overseas Enterprise to the Close of the Seventeenth Century. Oxford, GB: Oxford University Press, 2001. Comparisons to slavery Treatment of Irish indentured servants varied widely, and has been the subject of considerable historical debate. Comparisons between the treatment of Irish indentured servants (particularly in Barbados) and the treatment of African slaves have been especially controversial. While most recent academic studies have been careful not to equate indentured servitude with chattel slavery, some historians have nonetheless drawn close comparisons between these two labor systems, and other writers have sometimes conflated them. According to Kathryn Stelmach Artuso, even historians such as Hilary Beckles (whose work Artuso calls \\"seminal in the field\\") have drawn \\"surprisingly close parallels between the experiences of Africans and Irish in the Caribbean.\\" Beckles has referred to some Irish indentured servants as \\"temporary chattels\\" who were kept in \\"slavelike conditions\\" and lived in a state \\"nearer to slavery than freedom.\\" Beckles stops short, however, of suggesting that Irish servants were \\"'slaves' in the sense that blacks were.\\" Similarly, historian Nini Rodgers has written that Irish indentured servants \\"were not slaves,\\" but nonetheless argues that the \\"difference must have seemed academic\\" to many of them. According to Rodgers, this was particularly true in places such as Barbados, where high death rates sometimes \\"cancelled out\\" the primary difference between slaves and servants' experiences: that slavery was permanent while indenture was temporary. Rodgers notes, however, that there were other differences between the experiences of servants and those of slaves: masters provided servants with meat but denied it to slaves, servants received European-style clothes (including shoes) while slaves did not, and the two groups slept in different quarters. According to Rodgers, masters sometimes worked servants harder because they only possessed their service for a limited time, and this fact underscores \\"the complexity of making comparisons\\" between slavery and indenture. According to Kevin Brady, Cromwellian exiles in Barbados held a position that was \\"between temporary bondage and permanent enslavement,\\" stating that the main difference between the servants and slaves was that they were not sold as chattel. Brady states that they were often subject to \\"glaringly inhumane treatment by aristocrats of the planter class\\" and that they \\"were not given the material or monetary compensation\\" usually provided to indentured servants at the end of their term.Kevin Brady, \\"Dublin,\\" in Junius P. Rodriguez The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery, ABC-CLIO (1997). According to Simon P. Newman, Irish prisoners \\"were treated with singular brutality\\" by planters who \\"disdained them as illiterate Catholic savages.\\" Other historians, when discussing comparisons between slavery and Irish indentured servitude, have focused on how Irish people were both colonized and colonizers in the Caribbean. According to historian Donald Akenson's study of Irish people on Montserrat, for example, white indentured servitude on the island \\"was so very different from black slavery as to be from another galaxy of human experience,\\" and many Irish people (including former servants) prospered there. Similarly, philosopher Michael J. Monahan has argued that Irish servants in Barbados occupied an ambiguous racial position in the eighteenth century, which separated them both from other Europeans and from African slaves, and could work to their advantage as well as to their detriment. According to Monahan, even the highest \\"and most likely exaggerated\\" estimates that as many as fifty thousand Irish laborers were sent to the Caribbean against their will \\"pales by comparison\\" to the millions of West African slaves who were sold into slavery, and it is important to avoid what he calls \\"facile equivocations between the conditions of (at least some) Irish laborers and chattel slaves\\" or between slavery and involuntary indenture, which \\"are not the same thing.\\" Monahan nonetheless argues, however, that it is an \\"important fact\\" that there were some similarities between the situations of some involuntary indentures and African slaves. He is careful to note, however, that this is not to deny that there were \\"significant, even crucial differences\\" between the experiences of involuntary Irish servants and those of slaves. Some popular and non-academic writers have made much more direct comparisons between the experiences of Irish indentured servants and those of African slaves. Conspiracy theorist and Holocaust denier Michael A. Hoffman II, for example, wrote a self-published book in 1993 entitled, \\"They Were White and They Were Slaves: The Untold History of The Enslavement of Whites in Early America\\", in which he argued that chattel slavery and indentured servitude were similar enough to both be called slavery, and sought to recover the \\"suppressed history\\" of Irish slavery. In 2000, writer Sean O'Callahan published To Hell or Barbados, which argued that the \\"Irish white slave trade\\" had been a key component of the \\"ethnic cleansing of Ireland\\" during the eighteenth century. Similarly, television documentary producers Don Jordan and Michael Walsh claimed in their 2008 book White Cargo : The Forgotten History of Britain's White Slaves in America that \\"slavery is not defined by time but by the experience of the subject,\\" and sought to expose the \\"forgotten history\\" of white slavery. These books have been harshly reviewed by historians. Writing in The Historian, for example, historian Dixie Ray Haggard wrote that Jordan and Walsh had deliberately conflated two very different labor systems by comparing slavery and indenture. According to Haggard, \\"they fail to acknowledge, or maybe understand, that each institution, slavery and indentured servitude, had its own purpose and position within the colonial economy and society,\\" and chose to \\"oversimplify and confuse\\" rather than explore the complexity of colonial history.Dixie Ray Haggard, \\"White Cargo: The Forgotten History of Britain's White Slaves in America\\". The Historian 73, no. 1 (2011): 191. Similarly, historian Dominic Sandbrook wrote that while Jordan and Walsh were \\"right to remind us that African slavery was one form of bondage among many,\\" the indentured servants \\"were not slaves,\\" and \\"calling them slaves...stretches the meaning of slavery beyond breaking point\\".Dominic Sandbrook, \\"The forgotten history of Britain's white slaves\\". The Telegraph. May 3, 2007. According to Nini Rodgers, these works developed out of the \\"horror of white people being on a level with blacks\\" which accounts of servants and slaves laboring together had prompted in Ireland during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and which survived into the new millennium through works such as O'Callaghan's. Since the books were published, white supremacist and white nationalist groups have adopted the notion of \\"Irish slavery,\\" often as a means of countering the historical burden of African slavery and black Americans' demands for redress, or of undermining and attacking the Black Lives Matter movement. Because such memes and social media posts have widely spread the myth in mass-market publications, it prompted scholars and writers such as Liam Hogan, Laura McAtackney and Matthew C. Reilly to speak out against the \\"myth of Irish slavery.\\" Decline of indenture The number of prisoners who were forcibly transported to the New World dropped rapidly after 1650, and \\"convict transportation never became a reliable source of coerced colonial labor\\" during the seventeenth century. Penal servitude was considered unsatisfactory by plantation owners: the number of prisoners arriving was too small, and they were considered poor workers. In addition, colonial authorities worried that Irish Catholics would side with French troops in the event of an attack, or conspire with slaves to revolt against plantation owners. Some Irish servants did indeed rebel during a French attack on Saint Kitts during 1666‚Äì1667, while others made common cause with slaves during a revolt in Bermuda during 1661. According to historian Abigail Swingen, only about 4,500 convicts were transported to Virginia or the West Indies between 1655 and 1699, while the number of prisoners of war transported during this period was likely less than 5,000‚Äì10,000. According to historian Robin Blackburn, a total of about 8,000 Irish captives were sent to the American colonies during the 1650s. While Irish servants were a substantial portion of the population of Barbados, Jamaica, Montserrat, and Saint Kitts from the seventeenth until the middle of the eighteenth century, then, former indentured servants typically either returned to Europe or migrated to British North American colonies as slave labor increasingly replaced indentured servitude as the primary labor system in these colonies. Some, however, stayed, and their descendants ‚Äì such as the redlegs of Barbados ‚Äì still live in the Caribbean today.

Peter went to India as a servant of Sir Thomas Rumbold, 1st Baronet (Governor of Madras from 1777 to 1780) and eventually became secretary to the government at Madras and a member of the Council of Madras, in which office he amassed a fortune of ¬£40,000. In 1781 he was dismissed from the service of the East India Company possibly for profiteering.Scarratt, Anne, The Woollen Industry of Modbury, The Modbury Group, 2005‚Äì13 , details regarding the Perring family and their cloth business in Modbury On his return to England, he married Lucinda Manning, the beautiful daughter of Rev.

Peter Perring died childless and his heir to Membland became his nephew Sir John Perring, 1st Baronet (1765‚Äì1831) (son of his brother Philip), senior partner of Perrings Bank and Lord Mayor of London in 1803. His bank failed in the Panic of 1825 after which he sold his estates.

In 1836 he was high sheriff of Devon. A justice of the peace and deputy lieutenant. He married in 1816, Bridget, daughter of George Atkinson, Esq., of Temple Sowerby, Westmoreland; issue, five sons and six daughters. He died 23 March 1859 in the Royal Crescent, Bath, Somerset.

He was senior partner of Barings Bank, which had originated in nearby Exeter, Devon. In 1861 he had married Louisa Emily Charlotte Bulteel (died 1892), a daughter of John Crocker Bulteel (1793‚Äì1843) of Fleet, Holbeton, the adjoining estate, MP for South Devon 1832‚Äì4 and Sheriff of Devon in 1841. In 1889 he built the surviving Bull and Bear gatelodge at Membland, with datestone and his monogram.http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/101168408-bull-and-bear- lodge-holbeton#.WYtK4FGQwqc This was a humorous dual reference to the couple's surnames and the stockmarket beasts the bull and bear, appropriate to two families of bankers. =Gray= In 1900 William Cresswell Gray, shipbuilder from Hartlepool, purchased Membland from John Headon Stanbury, who was a hotelier from Exeter. Stanbury had bought the estate in the previous year and planned to develop the area that bordered the River Yealm. When Gray became the owner, the Membland estate included the Hall and 2720 acres of land. In 1904 Gray purchased another estate, this time in Yorkshire called Thorp Perrow of about 5000 acres, and this became his preferred residence. Membland was reportedly let in 1907 to Sir George White, 1st Baronet for the season. In 1912 Gray put the estate up for sale but failed to find a buyer. He continued to market the property, even making efforts during the early part of WWI by offering to extend the completion until the end of the war. As the war continued Gray offered the Hall, with a sum of ¬£2000 for use as a convalescent home for wounded soldiers, but the authorities considered the running costs would be prohibitive. However, the Hall was taken up as a training facility for officer cadets until about 1919. By the time of Grays death in 1925 Membland Hall had still not been sold, although he had been successful in reducing the size of the estate to 500 acres in 1919 and eventually to 227 in 1924. The House was purchased after Gray's death by Stanley Thomas Pitts with 19 acres of ground; he demolished the building and sold off the salvaged materials. Pitts, a corn merchant from Yelverton, had bought Membland Hall with 19 acres of land for a nominal fee of ¬£2,200. As the new owner he was placed under an obligation to maintain water supplies from springs to surrounding properties that had previously enjoyed them. For this he received about ¬£50 per year in fees. He had hoped to extend his water supply network to Newton Ferrers, or sell the rights to the District Council, but the impending Plympton St Mary Rural District Council, Local Water Act jeopardised his plans. Under this proposal the council were to install new water mains and these would be in direct competition to Pitts. He took his case to the Court of Referees in the House of Commons in May 1928, but failed to have his objections considered.

She married Carlo Gradenigo, the Venetian governor of Verona. The case of Madaluzza Contarini Gradenigo was one of the more famed of its time, and belonged to the Inquisition's opposition to the new freedom of aristocratic women in 18th-century Venice. Previously, the upper class women of Venice had by custom lived a secluded life. This changed in the early 18th-century, when the daughters of the doge Domenico Contarini, by their example, ended the use of zoccoli, a type of shoe customarily used by Venetian upper class women and restricting their movements.Louisa law: The Dogaressa After this, the female members of the Venetian aristocracy begun to participate in social life escorted by the cavaliere servente, attended the theater and kept their own apartments outside of the homes, called Casino's, which soon became known as gambling halls.Louisa law: The Dogaressa This informal development met with great resistance from the church, who which to set examples in the opposite direction, who in 1774 banned women from behaving to freely in public and, two years later, banned women from attending the theater without a mask and a veil and prosecuted Elisabetta Labia Priuli, Maria Bon Todarini and Julia Tron for having violated the ban.Louisa law: The Dogaressa The case of Madaluzza Contarini Gradenigo was notable example of this conflict.

In 1764, she was prosecuted by the Venetian Inquisition. She had been reported to the Archbishop of Udine because she openly lived with a lieutenant Arneh in Gorizia, and for having participated in high society life with him.Louisa law: The Dogaressa When she was widowed, she remarried Bortolo Gradenigo, the Venetian ambassador to Paris. On 1 February 1765, the Inquisition banned her from accompanying her spouse to his position in Paris, so as to not bring Venice into disrepute because of her personal lifestyle.Louisa law: The Dogaressa When her spouse was appointed ambassador to Vienna, she was banned from accompanying him there by the Venetian authorities for the same reasons.Louisa law: The Dogaressa When he was appointed ambassador to Constantinople in 1775, however, her spouse arranged for her to be brought to him there in secret before she could be banned from it.Louisa law: The Dogaressa Her presence in the Ottoman Empire was deemed destructive to the reputation of the Republic of Venice because of her infamous reputation, particularly in an Islamic country, and on 31 July 1775, the Venetian Inquisition sent a demand to her spouse to send her back.Louisa law: The Dogaressa He refused, however, and she stayed with him for four years.

The Erie Municipal Building on State Street History The idea of the department was conceived with the City Charter of 1851. By 1856, the department consisted of a Chief of police and three patrolmen. By the late 1880s, the department had grown to 25 officers. These officers primarily walked the beat, however some did use bicycles to patrol, and the force also maintained a horse-drawn wagon, primarily used in prisoner transport.City of Erie Police Department > Home During the early 1900s the department moved to more modern methods of transportation and began using motorcycles for city patrol. On June 7, 1910, the first motorcycle officer began patrolling the city. As of 2016, eight motorcycle officers patrol the streets. By the mid 1920s, automobiles were introduced as a new method of patrol for officers. New standards put forth by the FBI encouraged cities to have a ratio of two officers per 1,000 residents. The Erie Police Department attempted to meet this standard by increasing its staff to 136 officers by 1941, thus creating the need for patrol units. These units consisted of automobile patrol, motorcycle patrol, traffic enforcement, and foot patrol. The 1960s saw the formation of the Erie Policy Academy, which would require candidates to attend a number of training classes and exercises. As technology took the main stage in the 1970s and 80's, the department began moving to an electronic record system, and in 1985, implemented its first computer system, PIDAS. Federal grants allowed the department to also add desktop computers and dictation devices to the office areas within the department. The department currently maintains a staff of 173 police officers, and a strong outreach programs within the community. Chief of Police Daniel Spizarny, a 27-year veteran of the police force, succeeded Donald Dacus as Chief of Police on January 3rd, 2018 after Mayor Joe Schember was sworn into his first term. He rose to the rank of lieutenant and has been a detective, a patrolman and member of the SWAT team. He most recently served as the insurance fraud investigator. Community Relations The Erie Police Department works closely with the community in an effort to build a strong relationship. Programs such as the Erie Police Explorers, which started on September 26, 1978 and still serving the community today. The program looks for teens and young adults between the ages of fourteen and twenty-one who hold an interest in law enforcement. The program helps to show the young folks the skills and requirements needed to be a law enforcement officer, while also teaching the core values of serving the community. Media Relations The City of Erie Police Department currently holds a Media Relations Policy which sets forth the policies and agreements between the EPD and media outlets. The policy helps the department, along with local and national media, to maintain a channel of communication to the public, without violation of law or infringement on an individuals rights. The policy also describes the role of the Information Officer, the obligation to the media, media ride alongs for special assignments, special considerations, and arrest information.Erie Police Department Media Relations Policy See also * John Wilson Murray - former Erie detective 1868-1873 References Category:Municipal police departments of Pennsylvania ","title":"Erie Police Department"},{"id":"51909259","text":"P√ºrevdorjiin Orkhon (born December 25, 1993) is a Mongolian freestyle wrestler.

National Prison Radio (NPR) is the world's first national radio station for prisoners.; It is run by the Prison Radio Association (PRA), a charity, in partnership with Her Majesty's Prison Service and the National Offender Management Service (NOMS). It broadcasts 24 hours a day, seven days a week to prisoners in over 100 establishments across England and Wales. Prisoners receive the service as an audio channel via in- cell TV systems. It is available to over 80,000 prisoners. It aims to reduce re-offending by engaging prisoners in education and discussion, helping people in custody to develop strategies for dealing with the issues led them to prison. The station's programmes are presented and produced by serving prisoners working alongside the PRA's staff of professional radio producers. Content supports NOMS' objective to reduce re-offending by providing information vital for progressing successfully through a prison sentence. It promotes educational opportunities, discussion of issues related to crime and justice, as well as messages and requests from prisoners‚Äô families and friends. National Prison Radio aims to help prisoners face up to the effects their actions have had on themselves, their families, victims and society as a whole, encouraging them to see prison as a place of positive change. It offers positive peer influence directly to prisoners in their cells, in a way that no other intervention can.  Origins  The idea for a prison radio station was first mooted in 1993 by advertising executive Mark Robinson. It was in response to a spate of suicides, self-harm and violent incidents at HM Prison Feltham. With support from prison governor Joseph Whitty and deputy governor Steve Guy-Gibbens, as well as prison officer Bob Clements and fundraiser Roma Hooper OBE, Robinson launched Radio Feltham on 1 February 1994, broadcasting into every cell in the prison. Radio Feltham's success led to interest from other prisons across England and Wales to engage with prison radio. To address the need for expertise in the development of prison radio, Roma Hooper and Mark Robinson established the Prison Radio Association (PRA) in 2006, as a charity that offers guidance and expertise to prisons interested in setting up and running their own radio projects. The PRA launched a radio station in HMP Brixton, called Electric Radio Brixton, in November 2007. The first programme was presented by serving prisoners alongside BBC Radio 1‚Äôs Bobby Friction. Studio guests included Billy Bragg and Mick Jones. The programme was broadcast in front of a live audience, including the future Chief Executive of NOMS, Michael Spurr. Electric Radio Brixton was run by station manager Andrew Wilkie, who worked with serving prisoners to produce radio programmes which were broadcast directly into the cells of 800 prisoners. The National Prison Radio production suite inside HM Prison Brixton. Within 18 months of its launch, Electric Radio Brixton won four Sony Radio Academy Awards. Following a visit to meet the team behind Electric Radio Brixton, Guardian columnist Zoe Williams said ‚ÄúThis station sets a new standard not just for community radio, or charity radio, or cheap radio, but for all radio.‚Äù In 2009 Electric Radio Brixton re-launched to become National Prison Radio, the world's first national radio service for prisoners. Part of a trailblazing partnership with the National Offender Management Service (NOMS), National Prison Radio began broadcasting 24 hours a day, seven days a week, via in-cell television, to prisons across England and Wales.  Content  National Prison Radio is a linear service broadcasting 24 hours a day, seven days a week, into prison cells. The station broadcasts a mixture of speech and music content, all designed to support prisoners through their sentences, helping them to make appropriate use of the rehabilitation services available to them while they are in prison and preparing them to live crime-free lives after release. Programming closely reflects NOMS‚Äô Seven Pathways to Reducing Reoffending. The emphasis lies on helping prisoners to take responsibility for their own lives and the lives of those around them, as well as providing information about support services available in prison. Programmes are produced by prisoners working alongside the charity's staff team of professional radio producers. The bulk of programming is produced in Styal and Brixton prisons, but in 2015, PRA staff began running pop-up radio production workshops in other prisons across the estate. Content generated from these workshops are broadcast on ‚ÄòNPR Takeover Days‚Äô. The project more than doubled the number of prisoners contributing to on-air programmes in a year, up from 475 prisoners in 2014 to 992 in 2015. Each hour, National Prison Radio broadcasts a news bulletin from the studios of Independent Radio News. The station also produces its own daily Prison News bulletin ‚Äì a short summary of news and information likely to be of interest to prisoners. The Prison News bulletins include information published by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons, updates on changes to prison and justice policy, and reports on activities taking place in prisons across the country and beyond. Other key programmes featured on National Prison Radio include: * Porridge ‚Äì a daily breakfast show which is designed to put listeners into a positive frame of mind in preparation for the day; * NPR Talk ‚Äì a daily speech strand which includes in-depth features and interviews designed to inspire and inform listeners, engaging the audience in the debates that surround criminal justice and celebrating the achievements of people who have successfully turned their backs on patterns of behaviour that may have led them to prison; * The Request Show ‚Äì a daily two-hour request show designed to build National Prison Radio's audience and keep people in prison in touch with family and loved-ones on the outside; * Straightline ‚Äì a weekly dance music-based request show. This is the only programme on the station that's available to the general public, hosted on Mixcloud and featuring requests from prisoners to their family and loved-ones on the outside; * Freedom Inside ‚Äì a weekly yoga programme produced in partnership with the Prison Phoenix Trust which offers structured meditation and yoga sessions via the radio; * Outside In ‚Äì a monthly programme produced by volunteers from the BBC and presented by former prisoners, which aims to prepare prisoners for life after prison; * Books Unlocked ‚Äì a nightly audiobook serialization produced in partnership with the National Literacy Trust * YO Takeover ‚Äì a monthly programme produced by prisoners at HM Prison Isis, aimed at young adults in prison; * Open Road ‚Äì a monthly magazine programme targeted at Gypsy, Traveller and Roma prisoners; * The Love Bug ‚Äì a weekly music programme which is designed to encourage people in prison to write letters to their loved-ones on the outside; * Dream Time ‚Äì broadcasting speech and music which aims to reassure and orientate people in prison during the hours of darkness, when prisoners are at their most vulnerable to self-harm and suicide. This programme broadcasts through the night, every night. In 2015, the PRA teamed up with BBC Drama North to produce a radio drama called ‚ÄòBound‚Äô for broadcast on National Prison Radio. It was recorded in the BBC's drama studios and on location at HMP Styal. It told the story of a young pregnant prisoner fighting to keep her baby with her inside prison. The cast included serving prisoners and professional actors, including Sally Carman, John Henshaw and Matthew McNulty. ‚ÄòBound‚Äô was broadcast by BBC Radio 4 in January 2017. In 2016 National Prison Radio broadcast a live event called 'Letters From The Inside', in which performers including Olivia Colman, Benedict Cumberbatch, Kate Tempest, Russell Brand, Matt Berry, Clarke Peters and Mark Strong, as well as serving and former prisoners, read out remarkable letters, including some from prisoners, before a live audience in the chapel of HMP Brixton. The event was run in partnership with Letters Live to mark the tenth anniversary of the Prison Radio Association.  Audience  National Prison Radio is available in over 100 prisons across England and Wales. It broadcasts into the cells of around 80,000 prisoners. The PRA runs regular audience surveys, developed in partnership with the BBC and RAJAR, the official radio audience measurement body in the UK. A significant proportion of NPR's audience is surveyed regularly throughout the year to gather data on the impact of individual campaigns and overall audience levels. In 2016, surveys showed that 99% of prisoners were aware of National Prison Radio, and 76% of prisoners listen regularly. The average listener tunes in for 10.4 hours each week. When asked what they thought of the radio station: * 75% said they had been inspired by something they‚Äôd heard on National Prison Radio; * 85% said it had helped them to think about making positive changes to their lives; * 77% said they trust what they hear on National Prison Radio; * 63% said National Prison Radio provides information they can't get anywhere else; * 83% said NPR had made them aware of support available to them in prison; * 49% had taken action after hearing something on NPR. A key measure of impact for National Prison Radio is the number of letters the station receives from its audience and their loved ones. In 2015, more than 6,400 letters were sent to National Prison Radio by prisoners and more than 3,100 song requests and messages of support were sent in by prisoners‚Äô friends and families.

Planned by Henry Boyd, vicar of St Mark's Church, Silvertown, St Luke's was consecrated in 1875, with a parish split off from St Mark's. It is in neo-Gothic architecture imitating the medieval Early English style and has a fl√®che rather than a tower. It later took on St Matthew's Church, Custom House (previously a mission of St Mark's itself). It also created a mission church of its own, the Church of the Ascension (1887‚Äì1905), a mission to lascar seamen from 1887 and a mission in Ford Park Road by 1890. It was badly damaged in 1940 during the London Blitz, though services continued in a garage and then in the church hall. Temporary repairs to the church in 1949 were followed by permanent reconstruction by 1960. The area was also redeveloped in the postwar period as the Keir Hardie Park, meaning that in 1961 the parish of St Matthew's Church, Custom House and parts of the parishes of Holy Trinity and St Gabriel's were added to that of St Luke's. Deconsecrated in 1985, threatened with demolition in 1993 and closed in 1997, it is now a community centre and health centre. The parish still exists and now worships at a modern building on Ruscoe Road.

It is endemic to New Zealand. It is classified as Nationally Endangered by the Department of Conservation.  Taxonomy  This species was first described by Alfred Philpott in 1915 from specimens collected in Taihape in February and Feilding in March. Philpott named the species Selidosema albafasciata. In 1917 Edward Meyrick, when listing the species, attempted to correct the spelling of the epithet to albifasciata. This spelling was itself in error. In 1988 John S. Dugdale assigned the species to the genus Pseudocoremia. He retained the original spelling of the species epithet under the ICZN Rules, Article 32a (ii) and 32c. The type specimen was collected by Augustus Hamilton and is now held at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.

This name was also used when the species was discussed by George Vernon Hudson in 1950. In 1988 John S. Dugdale assigned the species to the genus Pseudocoremia. This classification of the species into Pseudocoremia is regarded as unsatisfactory. As such the species is also currently known as Pseudocoremia (s.l.) cineracia.

Philpott and Stewart Lindsay discovered this species at Flora River on the track to Mount Arthur tableland at an altitude of approximately 1000m. In 1928, in his book The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand, George Hudson discussed the species as a synonym of Selidosema productata. Later in 1928 Philpott stated that the moth he described in 1926 was a separate species explaining that although both productata and fluminea were variable, fluminea could be distinguished from the former species by its shorter antennal pectinations and the difference in the male genitalia. Hudson accepted this and discussed and illustrated the species under the name S. fluminea in his 1939 publication A supplement to the butterflies and moths of New Zealand. In 1988 John S.

Formerly the agency controlled Thailand's national parks but in 2002 they were taken over by the National Park, Wildlife and Plant Conservation Department (DNP), also part of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. Today, the agency aims to monitor forests, coordinate research, encourage community forest management, conserve forest land and monitor the wood industry.

Forming a sprawling series, they include several unusual details, such as an 'r' with a droop, a bruised-looking 'G' and 'C' with inward curls on the right, very short descenders and considerable variation in stroke width, creating a somewhat eccentric, irregular impression. Much less artistically and systematically designed than later families like Univers and Helvetica, they were very commonly used in British commercial printing in the metal type era, with a revival of interest as part of a resurgence of use of such \\"industrial\\" sans-serifs around the 1950s.http://www.klingspor- museum.de/KlingsporKuenstler/Schriftdesigner/Pechey/EPechey.pdf Writing in The Typography of Press Advertisement (1956), printer Kenneth Day commented that the family \\"has a personality sometimes lacking in the condensed forms of the contemporary sans cuttings of the last thirty years.\\" Jeremy Tankard has described them as the \\"most idiosyncratic of designs\\".

He was rated the best two-year-old colt in Europe in 2016, winning five of his six races including the Chesham Stakes, Tyros Stakes, Futurity Stakes, National Stakes and Dewhurst Stakes. On his three-year-old debut he won the 2000 Guineas and followed up with a second Classic victory in the Irish 2,000 Guineas. Background Churchill is a bay colt with a white star and three white socks bred in Ireland by Liberty Bloodstock, a breeding company associated with the Coolmore Stud organisation. He was sired by Galileo, who won the Derby, Irish Derby and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2001. Galileo is now one of the world's leading stallions and has been champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland eight times so far. His other progeny include Cape Blanco, Frankel, Golden Lilac, Nathaniel, New Approach, Rip Van Winkle, Found, Minding and Ruler of the World. Churchill's dam Meow showed good form as a juvenile in 2010, finishing second in the Queen Mary Stakes and winning the Listed Grangecon Stud Stakes. Meow was a daughter of the outstanding filly Airwave and closely related to the leading sprinter Jwala. The colt was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Like many Coolmore horses, the official details of his ownership have changed from race to race: he has sometimes been listed as being the property of Susan Magnier, while on other occasions he has been described as being owned by a partnership of Derrick Smith, Michael Tabor and Susan Magnier. Racing career =2016: two-year-old season= Spring Churchill made his racecourse debut in a six-furlong maiden race at the Curragh on 22 May in which he was ridden by Ryan Moore and started the 2/1 favourite in an eleven- runner field. After racing in mid-division he stayed on in the closing stages to finish third behind Van Der Decken and Magnification. Summer In June he was moved up in class and distance when he was sent to England to contest the Listed Chesham Stakes over seven furlongs at Royal Ascot. Starting the 8/11 favourite against twelve opponents he took the lead two furlongs out and won by half a length from Isomer despite drifting to the left in the closing stages. In July Churchill was moved up to Group Three class for the Tyros Stakes over seven furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse. He was sent off the 2/5 favourite, but after taking the lead a furlong out he was \\"strongly pressed\\" before prevailing by a neck from Alexios Komnenos. Only three horses appeared to oppose Churchill when the colt started at odds of 1/4 for the Group Two Futurity Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh on 21 August. Ridden by Seamie Heffernan he took the lead inside the final furlong and drew away in the closing stages to win by two lengths from the Jim Bolger-trained Radio Silence. After the race O'Brien commented \\"He's lazy and doesn't do a lot when he gets to the front, but he quickened nicely to get there. He'll come back here for the National Stakes next month. We think he's a Guineas horse and that he'll get further than a mile. He might get a mile and a half but the way he works you wouldn't be sure about that at this stage\\". Autumn On 11 September, over the same course and distance, Churchill started the odds-on favourite for Ireland's most prestigious race for juveniles, the Group One Vincent O'Brien National Stakes. The best of his six rivals appeared to be the British-trained Mehmas (ridden by Frankie Dettori), whose wins included the July Stakes and Richmond Stakes. Ridden by Moore, Churchill briefly struggled to obtain a clear run before taking the lead in the final furlong and then drawing away to win \\"comfortably\\" by four and a quarter lengths from Mehmas. O'Brien said \\"He's a very exciting horse. He settled and he quickened and I thought that he went like a real miler, but Ryan was adamant that a mile and a quarter would be no problem to him next year either. He can be idle when he hits the front so it was lovely when Frankie's horse eyeballed him and kind of leaned into him up the run in because that's exactly what he wanted. He would have learned a lot today\\". Churchill was then sent to England for the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 8 October. With Moore again in the saddle he was made the 8/11 favourite against six opponents including South Seas (winner of the Solario Stakes), Blue Point and Rivet. The O'Brien stable's pacemaker Lancaster Bomber took the lead from the start with Churchill restrained in mid-division. After briefly struggling to obtain a clear run the favourite took the lead inside the final furlong and won by one and a quarter lengths from Lancaster Bomber with Blue Point in third place and Thunder Snow in fourth. =2017: three- year-old season= Churchill was favourite for both the 2000 Guineas and the Epsom Derby throughout the winter of 2016/7 and the spring of 2017. Rather than run in any of the recognised trial races, Churchill made his debut as a three-year-old in the 2000 Guineas on 6 May at Newmarket, in which he was accompanied by his stablemates Lancaster Bomber and Spirit of Valor. He was made favourite ahead of nine opponents headed by Barney Roy (Greenham Stakes), Al Wukair (Prix Djebel) and Eminent (Craven Stakes). After tracking the leaders he took the lead approaching the final furlong and won by a length from Barney Roy with Al Wukair and Lancaster Bomber close behind in third and fourth. After the race Moore commented \\"He has a magnificent mind, he travels, has speed and loads of class. He was always racing comfortably ‚Äì he was there a little bit early. He always feels like there's more when you ask him\\", whilst O'Brien, who was winning the race for a record eighth time said \\"I was very worried about it being his first run. He's a big horse and we knew he would come on for the run. Ryan gave him a lovely ride. Everyone at home was very happy with the horse which is why we took the chance to come first time, so I'm delighted\\". Three weeks after his win at Newmarket, Churchill started 4/9 favourite for the Irish 2000 Guineas at the Curragh. Thunder Snow and Lancaster Bomber were again in opposition while the best of the other four runners appeared to be the previously undefeated Irishcorrespondent. Lancaster Bomber set the pace with Churchill settled towards the rear of the field before moving up on the outside in the straight. He took the lead from Thunder Snow approaching the final furlong and drew away in the closing stages to win by two and a half lengths. Ryan Moore commented \\"He wasn't enjoying the ground so I tried to help him along, but when I asked him he was there\\". At Royal Ascot on 20 June Churchill started odds-on favourite as he attempted to extend his winning run in the St James's Palace Stakes. He was restrained in the early stages as Lancaster Bomber set a steady pace but was unable to make any significant progress in the straight and finished fourth behind Barney Roy, Lancaster Bomber and Thunder Snow. After a break of more than two months Churchill returned for the International Stakes at York Racecourse in which he was matched against older horses and moved up in distance to ten and a half furlongs. He was made the 5/2 favourite and raced in third place before making progress in the traight but was beaten two lengths into second place by the four-year-old Ulysses. Assessment and awards On 8 November 2016 Churchill was named Champion two-year-old colt at the Cartier Racing Awards. In the official European Classification of two-year-olds for 2016 Churchill was given a rating of 122, making him the best juvenile of the season, one pound ahead of the filly Lady Aurelia and four pounds ahead of the colts Thunder Snow and National Defense. In the 2017 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Churchill was rated the twelfth-best horse in the world and the joint-best horse in Ireland.

It had its origins in a Sunday School opened in Stratford New Town by a City Missionary around 1850, for which a building was constructed on Queen Street by Samuel Gurney in 1853, within the parish of St John's Church, Stratford. St John's vicar William Holloway was ambivalent about the mission and so friction arose when the vicar of All Saints, A J Ram, bought a site for the mission to build a church, initially an iron hall in 1859 and a permanent church in 1864, both dedicated to St Paul. The latter was built with assistance from Thomas Fowell Buxton and Raymond Pelly. The permanent church was then assigned a separate parish in 1865, split from that of St John's. The church was destroyed by a V-weapon in 1945, but was replaced by a new building, consecrated in 1953. St Paul's parish opened a mission church of St Mark to provide services for factory girls, opening in 1877, building a permanent building in 1891, suffering bomb damage and finally being sold to the Methodist Church after 1945.

Mary Barr's relationship and interactions with Mahatma Gandhi, whom she refers to as Bapu (father). Several of Gandhi's letters to the author, originally an English missionary in India, are included in full. The book was originally published in India in 1949. A revised edition was published in India in 1956. The book has been reviewed in several magazines, and discussed in other books. Background In her Prologue, Barr describes the book as an \\"offering to thousands of persons all over the world who look up to... Gandhi, but have not had the author's opportunity of seeing him at work over a period of years\\".Bapu, first edition (1949). She explains that her intent is \\"to show Gandhi, the human being, to those many Europeans who are frankly puzzled by his personality, and... to give a great deal of detail such as would satisfy those who love him\\" and wish to learn even more about him. For the latter group, Gandhi's letters are \\"given with his exact wording, punctuation and headings\\". When Gandhi was asked if he would mind her writing a book, he said \\"Yes, you may write your book. It will remove come cobwebs\\". A note from the publisher stated that the manuscript of the book had been received before Gandhi was assassinated, and that \\"it was felt that much of the feeling of devotion and understanding would have been lost if the present tense was changed, and so we prefer to present the book as if about a Living Personage\\". Synopsis Bapu opens with Barr explaining how she came to meet Mahatma Gandhi after having been in India for ten years in charge of a missionary boarding school in Hyderabad State. When she was in England on a furlough in 1931 she began to take an interest in Gandhi's writings and speeches. When returning to India, Barr had the good fortune of being a fellow passenger of Gandhi's on a ship from Italy to India, allowing her to become acquainted with Gandhi and observe the daily patterns of behavior of him and his small party of companions returning from the second Round Table Conference in London. Later chapters describe Barr's correspondence and various meetings with Gandhi, how she was pressured by the British government and missionary authorities to end her association with Gandhi. her eventual resignation from her position at the mission, her visits to Gandhi at his ashram and in prison, how she spent time living at Gandhi's ashram, and how she eventually left the ashram in the service of Gandhi's movement. In an epilogue she states \\"The human personality depicted in the foregoing pages is no longer in the World as we knew him, but 'his soul goes marching on.' He brought religion into the service of the humdrum of daily life.... by sheer love and self-discipline he made mundane things beautiful: from pans to politics, he made them shine.\\" The book also contains a glossary of the meanings of about two dozen Indian words. Both editions contain an introduction by K. G. Mashruwala. The second edition contains an additional chapter, a tribute to Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, a comrade of Gandhi's, whose houseguest she was in 1941. Reviews and influence Reviews of Bapu have appeared in The Times of India, the Modern Review, the Indian Review and The Aryan Path The Times of India viewed the first edition as having \\"succeeded very well\\", stating that the book was Two reviews appeared in the Modern Review. In 1950, Nirmal Kumar Bose wrote that the first edition Bose speculated that \\"Perhaps a large part of the greatness of Mahatma Gandhiwas due to this.\\" In 1958, D. N. Mookerjea reviewed the second edition, stating that \\"A great life is a source of inspiration to all. People of different countries, castes and creeds find a common meeting- ground\\", and that Barr \\"gives us a true, unexaggerated, respectful account of this great man\\". Reviews of Bapu also appeared in the Indian ReviewIndian Review, December 1949. (1949) and The Aryan PathThe Aryan Path, October 1957, by E.P.T. (1957). In his Gandhi bibliography, Pandiri describes Bapu as \\"filled with carefully observed and recorded details of Gandhi's daily life\\", stating that \\"Barr's narration is valuable since it is tender and yet free of sentimentalism\\". Weber described Bapu as \\"touch[ing] on [Gandhi's] motherly relationship with the author\\", and devoted several pages to narrating Barr's life, drawing largely on Bapu. Bapu includes a prayer, composed by Gandhi and first given to Barr, that has been displayed at Sabarmati Ashram.Bapu, 1st edition, pp. 88-89. Barr explains that \\"Miss Linforth... had asked me to get Gandhi to give her a message, so he enclosed in his letter to me this little prayer, which she framed and put up in her center, \\"Lord of humility, dwelling in the little pariah hut, help us to search for Thee throughout that fair land watered by Ganges, Brahmaputra and Jumna. Give us receptiveness, give us open- heartedness, give us Thy humility....\\" (p. 88) Suresh Chandvankar described seeing the prayer displayed in Gandhi's former cottage at the ashram when he visited in 2012. The prayer has been translated into Gujarati and Hindi and set to music.Chandvankar (2012) explained that \\"the questions regarding the prayer were haunting me...

It was built for the Sisters of St. Joseph to function as a hospital in the city of Aarhus as a supplement to the public hospitals. It was designed by the architect Thorkel M√∏ller in baroque revival style. The Sisters of St. Joseph operated St. Joseph's Hospital for 64 years until it sold the building to Aarhus County in 1971. It has since housed VUC Aarhus for a number of years and as of 2015 Kiloo owned the building and was planning to make the it their headquarters.  History  St. Joseph's Hospital in 1907 In the late 1800s the first Catholic nuns since the Reformation arrived in Denmark. Initially just a few members of the Sisters of St. Joseph who settled in Copenhagen where, in 1875, they opened St. Joseph's Hospital. In Aarhus they established themselves in Ryesgade where they taught girls in the catholic St. Knud's School. It was however through care for the sick that the nuns primarily became known. In the first years the nuns treated patients of any faith in private homes. In December 1900 the municipal doctor on behalf of the sisters requested support from the city council for a polyclinic with 20 beds for the poor and needy. The nuns worked fast and the clinic was opened shortly before the end of year 1900. It was however not without controversy since a local protestant organization had also offered to open a polyclinic. The city council opted to support the catholic sisters and this offended the local protestant priests. The controversy never escalated beyond strongly-worded letters in √Örhus Stiftstidende and other Danish papers, but it became a public spectacle involving priests and public servants. It was also symptomatic of the relationship between catholics and protestants in the years after reformation. In spite of the controversy the sisters' polyclinic became a success and after a few years it moved to larger rooms in √òstergade. This proved to be a temporary solution and in April 1902 the nuns asked to buy a parcel of land from the city. The negotiations took almost 2 years until February 1904 when a deal was reached for the sisters' to buy a property on Frederiksbjerg by Tietgens Plads. The hospital was built with patient rooms, laboratories, nurseries, operating rooms and a bath house. The upper floor was reserved as the sisters' living quarters while the polyclinic moved into the basement. The hospital was run jointly with municipal hospitals and management of St. Josephs Hospital was done in close cooperation with other hospitals in the city. Initially St. Josephs Hospital was divided in departments with each one chief physician. The first departments were the departments of medicine, neurology, ears, orthopedic and tuberculosis. Over time the departments were moved out of St. Josephs and into the hospitals in the city. St. Josephs became a hospital for people with long-term illnesses or who needed rehabilitation. In addition the hospital had a large number of private care patients. In 1957 18 nuns trained as nurses lived in the hospital. Over time the number of nuns fell and in 1970 the Sisters of St. Joseph had to sell the building to √Örhus County. The last nuns were allowed to stay but in 1976 the last of them left. At the time St. Josephs had gotten the reputation as a hospice. The County continued to run St. Josephs but in 1986 the last 18 patients were moved to Marselisborg Hospital. The building continued to house facilities for a center for treatment of psycho-physical disorders and a center for treatment for hearing- and speech. VUC Aarhus used the building as a school from 1987 to 2013 when Mogens de Linde bought it. In 2015, the computer games development company Kiloo bought the buildings, which underwent a lengthy renovation before being made their new headquarters in January 2018.  Architecture  Detail showing the mansard roof among other elements St. Josephs Hospital was designed by the architect Thorkel M√∏ller in baroque revival style. The building is constructed of red brick in two and half floors capped with a mansard roof. The upper floor under the mansard was designed for the nuns with homes and prayer room. South of the main building lies a small garden, surrounded by a brick wall capped with glazed black bricks.

Georges Henri Kaestlin (1892 ‚Äì 18 February 1981) was a banker who formed a leading collection of Russian Imperial and Zemstvo stamps after he and his family were forced to leave Russia following the 1917 revolution. His collection was donated to the Smithsonian Museum in 1984 following his wish that it not be dispersed as other important collections had been. Early life Georges Henri Kaestlin was born in Saint Petersburg in 1892 to Swiss parents. His father was the president and chairman of the Russian Bank for Foreign Trade. He was educated at the Prince Tenisheff Private School for Boys and later at the Imperial Polytechnic Institute from where he earned a degree in political economy. He was a keen sportsman, enjoying sailing, skiing and mountain climbing which he practiced during holidays at the family's Swiss home. By the age of 17 he had climbed many of the Swiss peeks.Biography of G.H. Kaestlin by Vera Kaestlin- Bock, 1985, in \\"Biography of G.H. Kaestlin\\", Thomas Lera, The London Philatelist, Vol. 124, No. 1425 (May 2015), pp. 174-175. Life in England Kaestlin embarked on a career in banking in Russia and married but was forced to leave the country with his family at the time of the revolution, never to return. They travelled to Sweden and Norway before settling in England where Kaestlin resumed his banking career. He lived in London and later Twickenham. His business career was uneventful and he devoted his energies to collecting and tennis which he played into his 70s. His only son died in an accident and his wife became seriously ill. After her death he retired to Switzerland. Philately Kaestlin began to collect Russian Imperial stamps as a young man, widening his collection to include Zemstvo stamps when he arrived in England and later concentrating on just that area. The Zemstvo stamps were a form of local stamp issued from 1865 by the Zemstvo unit of local administration to rectify the deficiencies of the Imperial Post which only covered the major towns, leaving rural areas without a postal service. He did not join philatelic societies, exhibit his collection, or write articles about it, however, he did make copious notes, research forgeries, and produce a typewritten catalogue of the collection. His write-up was meticulous and included hand-drawn maps. It is thought he also collaborated with Karl Schmidt, author of important Zemstvo catalogues of the 1930s. Despite his lack of participation in organised philately, Kaestlin was not completely unknown to the philatelic world, contributing to the guarantee fund for the Stamp Centenary Exhibition 1940, bidding in the Faberg√© auctions of 1940, and entering into correspondence with Sir John Wilson, keeper of the Royal Philatelic Collection. Kaestlin's collection consists of 13 volumes of stamps and covers, and 15 staging albums of stamps and postal stationery covering the period 1865 to 1917. In total, it has more than 1,500 pages and 14,000 stamps including many acquired from the Agathon Faberg√© and Philipp von Ferrary collections. In 2012, the Smithsonian Institution Scholarly Press published a detailed account of the Kaestlin collection by Thomas Lera and Leon Finik in their Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge series.Lera, Thomas, & Leon Finik.

The attack was the deadliest single bombing in the then-two year long Yemeni civil war. The funeral was being held for the father of former interior minister Jalal al-Rowaishan. Sana'a mayor Abdel Qader Hilal was reportedly among those killed. The Saudi-led coalition initially denied responsibility but then took responsibility and put the blame on information given by the Yemeni government. The United Nations alleged that the Saudi-led coalition had violated international humanitarian law because the bombing was a 'double tap' attack, or a type of airstrike where the first bombing is followed by a second one soon after, with the aim of targeting the wounded, aid workers, and medical personnel tending to them. The UN report said: \\"The second air strike, which occurred three to eight minutes after the first air strike, almost certainly resulted in more casualties to the already wounded and the first responders.\\" Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said that his government was being careful to abide by humanitarian law; however, it stated that its strike on the funeral hall was based on \\"incorrect information\\" given to them by the Yemeni government and that it had been carried out without authorization. Human Rights Watch identified the munitions used in the airstrike as 500 pound laser-guided bombs manufactured by the United States, and called on the U.S. to suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Reactions =Domestic= Thousands of Yemenis marched in the capital city on 9 October to protest the air raid and show solidarity to the victims. =International= * - Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called the attack an outrageous violation of international humanitarian law and calling for a full inquiry with consequences for those found culpable. UN humanitarian coordinator Jamie McGoldrick described it as a \\"horrific attack\\" and called for an immediate investigation. * - After initially denying it was involved, the country later admitted it had ordered the airstrikes and expressed its deep regret of the attack in the letter from its United Nations mission to the U.N. Security Council. It promised to release the results of its own investigation into the strike and claimed it was careful to abide by international humanitarian law. * - Despite its alliance with Saudi Arabia, the US condemned the attack. White House National Security Spokesman Ned Price said the country had launched an \\"immediate review\\" of its already reduced support for the coalition. \\"US security cooperation with Saudi Arabia is not a blank cheque,\\" he said, adding the US was \\"prepared to adjust our support so as to better align with US principles, values and interests, including achieving an immediate and durable end to Yemen's tragic conflict\\". * - The British government said the bombing was \\"shocking\\" but that, unlike the US government, it would not be carrying out a review of British support for the Saudi-led coalition. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said that Britain was content for the coalition to carry out its own investigation into its actions. \\"They have the best insight into their own military procedures and will be able to conduct the most thorough and conclusive investigations,\\" she said. =Non-governmental organisations= * Human Rights Watch deputy director for Global Advocacy indicated that this bombing continues the observed pattern of Saudi coalition's bombings in Yemen, saying that \\"the whole war has been marked by attacks on weddings, hospitals, civilian infrastructure, civilian locations, so it fits a pattern. Better late than never, but the world should have woken up a long time ago to this.\\" * Amnesty International spokesperson Sunjeev Bery said: \\"The Saudi-led coalition has wreaked devastation by striking civilian communities across Yemen with bombs from the skies. Saturday's horrible bloodbath at the funeral hall in Sanaa is only the latest atrocity in this conflict. Since the conflict began in March 2015, markets hospitals, weddings, homes mosques and now [a] funeral gathering have been hit. The attack appears to be the latest in a string of unlawful attacks targeting civilian gatherings.\\" *Oxfam policy adviser Scott Paul said: \\"This was a massacre of civilians.

The stories are based on the experiences of William J. Flynn during his career as chief of the United States Secret Service from 1912‚Äì1917. It features King Baggot as the president of the Criminology Club and Marguerite Snow as a Secret Service agent who investigate spies. Among the events depicted are the sending of the Zimmermann Telegram, Franz von Rintelen's attempts to sabotage cargo loading in San Francisco Harbor, and the capture of the German espionage plans. It was directed by George Lessey, Wellington A. Playter, Leopold Wharton, and Theodore Wharton, and produced by the Whartons Studio. The serial is now considered lost. Because this serial was a commercial failure, it was the last one made by Whartons due to the studio being forced to declare bankruptcy.

Trump and Bush were in a bus on their way to film an episode of Access Hollywood, a show owned by NBCUniversal. In the video, Trump described his attempt to seduce a married woman and indicated he might start kissing a woman that he and Bush were about to meet. He added, \\"I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. ... Grab ‚Äòem by the pussy. You can do anything.‚Äùhttps://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/donald-trump-tape- transcript.html Commentators and lawyers have described such an action as sexual assault. News of the recording broke two days before the second 2016 presidential debate between Trump, the Republican nominee, and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Trump gave a statement in which he apologized for the video's content, but he attempted to deflect attention by saying that Bill Clinton had \\"said far worse to me on the golf course\\". The recording provoked strong reactions by media figures and politicians across the political spectrum. Statements from Republican officials were varied. Some, including Trump's vice-presidential running mate Mike Pence, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus indicated their disapproval of Trump's words but did not renounce their support or call for his resignation from the ticket. Other Republicans, most prominently former presidential nominee John McCain, stated that they would no longer support Trump's presidential campaign, and some called for his withdrawal from the ticket. House Speaker Paul Ryan announced that he would no longer defend or support Trump's campaign, although he did not officially retract his endorsement of Trump. Bush was fired from his position as a host on the Today show, another show owned by NBCUniversal and aired on the NBC television network, while Trump received allegations of sexual misconduct from several women. The release of the tape was regarded as an \\"October surprise\\", influencing public opinion in the weeks before the election. According to a 2020 study, it reduced public support for Trump. Recording The video was recorded in September 2005 in the NBC Studios parking lot while Trump was preparing to appear in an episode of the NBC soap opera Days of Our Lives. Access Hollywood, a syndicated entertainment news program owned by NBCUniversal, conducted a behind-the-scenes interview with Trump about the guest appearance in which Trump and Bush arrived in a tour bus for the Access Across America series of segments produced in commemoration of the program's 10th season. It features audio of Trump talking with Billy Bush, then co- anchor of Access Hollywood, on a bus embellished with the show's name. Trump and Bush were wearing microphones, which recorded their casual conversation. Trump was later described as \\"apparently aware at the time that he was being recorded by a TV program\\". According to an Access Hollywood spokesperson, there were seven other people on the bus: a camera crew of two, the bus driver, the show's producer, a production assistant, Trump's security guard, and Trump's public relations representative. Upon arriving at the lot, the camera crew was let off the bus so they could record Trump and Bush disembarking and meeting with Arianne Zucker, who portrayed Nicole Walker on the soap opera and appeared alongside Trump in the episode in which he guest starred. =Contents= In the video, Trump tells Bush about a failed attempt to seduce Nancy O'Dell, who was Bush's co-host at the time (circa 2005) of the recording: Later, referring to Arianne Zucker (whom they were waiting to meet), Trump says: Publication According to Access Hollywood, the discovery of the video was prompted by \\"Mr. Trump's denial of claims contained in an Associated Press story in which 20 former Apprentice employees described Mr. Trump's behavior toward women as lewd and inappropriate.\\" An NBC source said that an Access Hollywood producer remembered the conversation on Monday, October 3, and located it in the show's archives. The celebrity news website TMZ reports a different chronology: when senior executives at NBC learned about the video, they thought it was too early in the presidential campaign season to release it with maximum effect, and (according to TMZ) those executives publicly said they learned of the video long after they actually learned about it.\\"NBC Planned to Use Trump Audio to Influence Debate, Election\\" , TMZ (October 12, 2016): \\"Multiple sources connected with NBC tell us ... top network execs knew about the video long before they publicly said they did, but wanted to hold it because it was too early in the election.

NBC discussed whether to release the tape and had lawyers review the legality of the publication, as is common among other news media due to the possibility that the involved parties might file a lawsuit if the video was released. By Tuesday, October 4, NBC had drafted a story that it declined to broadcast for another three days. On Friday, October 7, at around 11 a.m., an unidentified source gave a copy of the tape to Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold, who contacted NBC for comment, notified the Trump campaign that he had the video, obtained confirmation of its authenticity, and released a story and the tape itself by 4 p.m. Alerted that the Post might release the story immediately, NBC News released its own story \\"mere minutes\\" after the Post story was published. By that evening, the Post story had become \\"the most concurrently viewed article in the history of the Post website\\" with more than 100,000 people reading it on the afternoon of October 7. The Post servers went offline for a short period that day due to the surge in web traffic. This story would later be one of the articles for which Fahrenthold received the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting. Reactions Women's March on Washington Reaction was swift, with Trump's general election opponent Hillary Clinton among the first political figures to respond to the tape, tweeting shortly after its release, \\"This is horrific. We cannot allow this man to become president.\\" Clinton's VP running mate Tim Kaine said of the tape, \\"It makes me sick to my stomach ... I'm sad to say that I'm not surprised.\\" At the second presidential debate two days later, Clinton said of the tape, \\"With prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them, politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve. Donald Trump is different.\\" In the second episode of season 42 of Saturday Night Live (first aired on October 8), Alec Baldwin parodied the controversy as Donald Trump. Samantha Bee, the host of Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, reversed the gender roles in the video and issued an \\"apology\\" for the parodied video on Twitter. Singer-songwriter Carly Simon donated her 1972 song \\"You're So Vain\\" for use in an anti-Trump advertisement ‚Äì the first time she has ever allowed its use for political purposes ‚Äì and announced her opposition to Trump in response to the tape. =Media and legal profession attention= Touching a person's genitals without consent (also known as groping) is considered sexual assault in most jurisdictions in the United States. Many attorneys and media commentators characterized Trump's statements as describing acts of sexual assault. Lisa Bloom, a sexual harassment expert and civil rights lawyer, stated: \\"Let's be very clear, he is talking about sexual assault. He is talking about grabbing a woman's genitals without her consent.\\" Trump and some of his supporters claimed that Trump was not saying he committed a sexual assault, or denied that groping is sexual assault. Journalist Emily Crockett says that this is further evidence of a trend to minimize sexual assaults against women. John Banzhaf, a George Washington University public interest law professor, stated, \\"if Trump suddenly and without any warning reached out and grabbed a woman's crotch or breast, it would rather clearly constitute sexual assault,\\" as indicated in Trump's statement \\"I don't even wait.\\" It has been argued, however, that despite Trump having stated \\"I don't even wait,\\" his full remarks could imply something akin to consent. This is pointed out by Trump's full remarks having included the statement \\"and when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\\" It brought further media comment on Trump's history of criticizing women for their looks, among other remarks criticized as sexist. On October 8, CNN aired segments from multiple interviews Trump gave to The Howard Stern Show prior to his political career in which he made comments similar to those on the Access Hollywood tape. In September 2004, Trump comments on his daughter Ivanka's body and, when asked, tells Stern that it is okay for him to call his daughter \\"a piece of ass\\". =Involved parties= Billy Bush While the controversy has focused mainly on Trump, Bush also faced backlash as a result of the tape, mainly due to his statement that Zucker \\"[is] hot as shit\\" and his goading her into hugging Trump after they get off on the bus. Bush received online criticism and calls for his resignation from The Today Show, where he was an anchor at the time. The Washington Post stated, \\"Bush's public image was damaged‚Äîperhaps beyond repair.\\" There were so many negative comments on Bush's social media accounts following the tape's release that his Twitter account was taken down on the evening of October 7. That evening, Bush issued an apology, saying, \\"Obviously I'm embarrassed and ashamed. It's no excuse, but this happened eleven years ago‚ÄîI was younger, less mature, and acted foolishly in playing along. I'm very sorry.\\" The controversy has led to speculation that Bush's spot on Today could be in jeopardy, both because of the backlash against him on social media and the possibility that the tape's release could create a toxic work environment between Bush and the show's mostly female production staff. NBC executives confirmed on the evening of October 8 that Bush's job was safe and he would address the controversy on the October 10 episode of Today. Politico noted that the audience of Today is disproportionately female so that a significant ratings drop in the wake of the controversy could still lead to Bush's dismissal. On Monday, October 10, NBC reversed course and announced that Bush would be suspended from Today indefinitely pending further review; as he was an anchor, his suspension was briefly addressed during that day's broadcast. One day later, on October 11, multiple media sources reported that NBC was \\"negotiating his exit\\". On October 17, NBC announced that Bush had resigned. Bush's status as a member of the Bush family (specifically, as the cousin of former President George W. Bush and the nephew of former president George H. W. Bush) was also noted in the wake of the controversy. The Economist noted, \\"Who would have thought that Mr. Bush, a presenter of NBC's Today news show, could end up playing a more influential role in this election than his cousin Jeb, whom many Republicans had expected to win it?\\" People and entities mentioned by Trump Nancy O'Dell, the married woman that Trump spoke of, said: > Politics aside, I'm saddened that these comments still exist in our society > at all. When I heard the comments yesterday, it was disappointing to hear > such objectification of women. The conversation needs to change because no > female, no person, should be the subject of such crass comments, whether or > not cameras are rolling. Everyone deserves respect no matter the setting or > gender. As a woman who has worked very hard to establish her career, and as > a mom, I feel I must speak out with the hope that as a society we will > always strive to be better. In response to having their product referenced by Trump on the tape, Tic Tac issued a statement on Twitter stating, \\"Tic Tac respects all women. We find the recent statements and behavior completely inappropriate and unacceptable.\\" Reacting to her unwitting role in this incident, Zucker wrote on TwitLonger, \\"How we treat one another, whether behind closed doors, locker rooms or face to face, should be done with kindness, dignity and respect.\\" =Republican Party= The incident was condemned by numerous prominent Republicans. Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairman Reince Priebus said, \\"No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.\\" The RNC suspended all support of Trump's campaign shortly thereafter. Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, tweeted, \\"Hitting on married women? Condoning assault? Such vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt America's face to the world.\\" Ohio governor John Kasich, a former primary rival to Trump, called the remarks \\"indefensible\\"; former Florida governor Jeb Bush, also a former primary rival, called them \\"reprehensible\\". Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also denounced the video, but continued to support Trump. Paul Ryan, the House Speaker, disinvited Trump from a scheduled campaign rally, announced that he would no longer defend or support Trump's presidential campaign, and in a highly unusual move freed down-ticket congressional members to use their own judgment, saying \\"you all need to do what's best for you and your district\\"; he did not, however, withdraw his endorsement of Trump. Many members of the Republican Party rescinded their endorsements as a result of the release of the video, including Governors Bill Haslam and Robert J. Bentley; Representatives Bradley Byrne, Jason Chaffetz, and Joe Heck; and Senators Kelly Ayotte, Mike Crapo, and John McCain. Former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who had previously kept his opinion private throughout the campaign, released a statement: \\"For the first time since I became a citizen in 1983, I will not vote for the Republican candidate for president ... As proud as I am to label myself a Republican, there is one label that I hold above all else ‚Äî American.\\"Dicker, Ron Arnold Schwarzenegger Says He Will Not Vote For Donald Trump HuffPost (October 10, 2016). Retrieved October 27, 2016. By October 11, \\"nearly a third\\" of Senate Republicans said they would not vote for Trump. Other Republicans expressed continued support for Trump, including former 2016 Republican candidate Ben Carson, evangelical leaders Tony Perkins and Ralph E. Reed Jr., and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Other evangelical leaders, particularly the Southern Baptist Convention Ethics and Policy Director, Dr. Russell D. Moore, publicly rebuked evangelical leaders who still supported Trump. In a tweet, Ted Cruz questioned why NBC, who had possession of the tape, sat on it for 11 years. Calls to drop campaign By October 8, several dozen Republicans had called for Trump to withdraw from the campaign and let his VP running mate, Mike Pence, take over the Republican ticket.Matt Canham & Thomas Burr, Utah Gov. Herbert and Rep. Chaffetz pull Trump endorsements, Huntsman says Trump should drop out after explicit video leaks, Salt Lake Tribune (October 8, 2016).Ali Vitali & Benjy Sarlin, Donald Trump Defiant as Top Republicans Flee Candidacy, NBC News (October 8, 2016). Among those favoring a Pence takeover were former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman Jr., U.S. Senators Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Deb Fischer of Nebraska, and U.S. Representatives Jason Chaffetz of Utah, Bradley Byrne of Alabama, Rodney Davis of Illinois, and Ann Wagner of Missouri. Pence himself released a statement on October 8, saying, \\"As a husband and father, I was offended by the words and actions described by Donald Trump in the eleven-year-old video released yesterday ... I do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them.\\" However, he said he still supported Trump since he \\"has expressed remorse and apologized to the American people.\\" Trump insisted he would never drop out. As of October 8, depending upon the state: * It was not possible to change the names on ballots at the late date for purely legal reasons. * Many general election ballots had already been printed, and it would be expensive to change them. * In states with early voting, thousands of ballots had already been cast. For these reasons, commentators said that it would have been very difficult, if not impossible, to replace Trump as the Republican nominee. Withdrawal of political support As the day wore on, a growing number of Republicans went beyond criticizing Trump's remarks or rescinding endorsements of him and began calling for Trump to drop out of the presidential race, ceding the Republican nomination to another person. On the afternoon of October 8, Trump responded with a tweet: \\"The media and establishment want me out of the race so badly - I WILL NEVER DROP OUT OF THE RACE, WILL NEVER LET MY SUPPORTERS DOWN! #MAGA\\". The Republican National Committee continued to support Trump, and within the next couple of days, several of the Republicans who wanted Trump to drop out said that they were still voting for him. Steve Bannon said in an interview on 60 Minutes that response to the controversy served as a \\"litmus test\\" for Trump's Republican allies. For example, according to Bannon, Chris Christie was denied a Cabinet position because he said Trump's comments were \\"completely indefensible\\". Trump's responses Trump acknowledged making the remarks, but tried to deflect by saying that Bill and Hillary Clinton had said and done worse. After the release of the Access Hollywood video, Trump's first public response came in the form of a written statement published on his campaign website: Trump and wife Melania Early on Saturday morning, October 8, Donald Trump issued a lengthier statement, released by video. In it, Trump said of the video's contents, \\"I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize.\\" He went on to \\"pledge to be a better man\\" and ended the video with the allegation that Bill Clinton had \\"abused women\\", and that Hillary Clinton had bullied her husband's victims. Trump's video ended with assurances that the Clinton allegations would be discussed in coming days. Trump's statement was criticized severely by the media and members of the public as insincere, and an attempt to divert attention away from Trump's comments and onto unsubstantiated accusations against his political opponents. Trump tweeted the next day: \\"Certainly has been an interesting 24 hours!\\" On October 10, Trump was also questioned about the tape during the second presidential debate of his campaign. He reiterated that it was \\"locker room talk\\", then said, \\"I'm not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people.\\" Trump's wife Melania said, \\"The words my husband used are unacceptable and offensive to me. This does not represent the man that I know.\\" She added that she hopes \\"people will accept his apology, as I have\\". In 2017, it was reported that Trump had questioned the authenticity of the tape in multiple private conversations that year, including one with a Republican senator, even though he had already acknowledged that the voice was his, and apologized, after the tape was revealed. In January 2017, shortly before his inauguration, Mr. Trump told a Republican senator that he wanted to investigate the recording that had him boasting about grabbing women's genitals. Effects and aftermath =Clinton‚ÄìTrump debates= The release of the tape led to a renewed anticipation towards the October 9 debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton, as it would be the first time for each candidate to directly address the controversy. Less than two hours before the debate began, Trump held a surprise press conference in St. Louis with Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, and Juanita Broaddrick, who have previously accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct, and Kathy Shelton, a rape victim whose rapist had been represented in the 1970s by Hillary, an appointed public defender. Describing the conference as his \\"debate prep\\", Trump described the women as \\"courageous\\" and \\"victims of the Clintons\\", with each of the women repeating their grievances with the Clintons. At the conference, Trump refused to answer journalists' questions about the Access Hollywood tape. Clinton's campaign dismissed the conference as \\"an act of desperation\\" and denounced Trump's \\"destructive race to the bottom\\". First Lady Michelle Obama said referring to the controversy, \\"It has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn't have predicted.\\" The New York Times reported that just before the press conference, advisers to the Trump campaign told Reince Priebus that Trump had to leave to attend a \\"meet and greet\\" because they feared that \\"Priebus would object if he knew the truth\\". Campaign chairman Steve Bannon told Trump, \\"[Broaddrick, Jones, Shelton, and Willey are] going to rub up on you and be crying... [a]nd you're going to be empathetic.\\" In response, Bannon recalled, Trump closed his eyes, moved his head back \\"like a Roman emperor\\", and said \\"I love it\\". Juanita Broaddrick told the Times she had \\"no idea what we were going in there for... [b]ut that doesn't matter. I would do it all again.\\" During the debate itself, co-moderator Anderson Cooper pressed Trump about whether the conversation on the tape meant that Trump had committed sexual assault. Trump said it \\"was locker room talk\\" and \\"I'm not proud of it,\\" and said he wanted to move on to other things, but finally responded \\"I have not.\\"Fact Check: Clinton and Trump debate for the second time, NPR (October 9, 2016). It was later revealed that Trump had arranged for the women from his press conference to sit in his family box and that they were to walk into the audience at the same time as Bill Clinton and confront him on live TV, but debate officials intervened and prevented the planned stunt from happening. The Associated Press later reported that Willey and Shelton had previously been financially compensated by Trump ally Roger Stone during the campaign. =Assault stories= Shortly after the story first broke on October 7, Canadian writer Kelly Oxford posted on Twitter, \\"Women: tweet me your first assaults. they aren't just stats.\\"See: * * Within hours, the tweet had gone viral, receiving thousands of responses, many of them relating to stories of sexual assaults on women. Over 30 million people viewed or replied to Oxford's tweet within a week. =Response of athletes and coaches= News report of voter reactions by Voice of America Numerous professional athletes and coaches rejected Trump's claim that what he said on the tape was \\"locker room talk\\", saying that such comments were not normal or acceptable.Cydney Adams, Professional athletes cry foul over Trump's \\"locker room talk\\", CBS News (October 10, 2016).Adam Howard, Athletes and Coaches to Donald Trump: Sexual Assault Is Not 'Locker Room Talk', NBC News (October 10, 2016).Sean Gregory, Donald Trump Dismisses His 'Locker Room Talk' As Normal. Athletes Say It's Not, Time (October 10, 2016). Los Angeles Clippers head coach Doc Rivers said, \\"[If Trump's comments are locker room talk] that's a new locker room for me.\\" Oakland Athletics pitcher Sean Doolittle tweeted, \\"As an athlete, I've been in locker rooms my entire adult life and uh, that's not locker room talk.\\" Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Chris Conley tweeted, \\"Just for reference. I work in a locker room (every day) ... that is not locker room talk. Just so you know...\\" Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Brett Anderson tweeted, \\"What kind of fucked up locker rooms has Donald Trump been in...\\" NBA point guard Kendall Marshall tweeted, \\"PSA: sexual advances without consent is NOT locker room talk.\\"Alana Horowitz Satlin, Pro Athletes Say No One Talks Like Trump in Locker Rooms, HuffPost (October 10, 2016). LA Galaxy midfielder Robbie Rogers tweeted, \\"I'm offended as an athlete that @realDonaldTrump keeps using this \\"locker room talk\\" as an excuse.\\" Olympic hurdler and sprinter Queen Harrison tweeted, \\"Locker room talk,' 'Boys will be boys,' 'Harmless banter.' These are not valid excuses for behavior. Never have been, never will be.\\" Atlanta Falcons tight end Jacob Tamme tweeted, \\"It's not normal. And even if it were normal, it's not right.\\" These responses also prompted the creation of the hashtag #NotInMyLockerRoom. Eleven months after the footage was leaked, retired professional boxer Floyd Mayweather defended Trump's comments stating, \\"People don't like the truth ... He speak like a real man spoke.\\" He added, \\"So he talking locker room talk. Locker room talk. 'I'm the man, you know what I'm saying? You know who I am. Yeah, I grabbed her by the p---y. And?'\\" =Anti-Trump memes and campaigns= The backlash from the comments prompted a \\"Pussy Grabs Back\\" hashtag urging women to vote against Trump on Election Day. Anti-Trump memes featuring cat imagery spread on social media. The Guardian wrote that an image of a snarling cat became a \\"rallying cry for female rage against Trump\\".Nicole Puglise, 'Pussy grabs back' becomes rallying cry for female rage against Trump, The Guardian (October 10, 2016). Trump's denial that he ever kissed or groped women without consent led to more accusations by several women that Trump sexually assaulted them.Avila, Theresa. \\"4 Women Allege Donald Trump ....\\" New York.

In response to the recording, Shannon Coulter started a viral campaign called #GrabYourWallet, which urges individuals to boycott various companies that sell Trump related products. Various companies have since dropped Trump's products in response to the boycott, including Shoes.com, Nordstrom, Bergdorf Goodman, and Neiman Marcus. =Alleged other tapes= On October 9, former staffers of Trump's reality show The Apprentice and journalist Geraldo Rivera said that they both individually have more damaging tapes of Trump, but did not say if they would be released to the public. Rivera later stated that he had searched his files and that he could not find anything relevant to the scandal. Since the tape's release, Bill Pruitt, a producer of the first two seasons of the television series The Apprentice, claims there is behind-the-scenes footage of Trump saying things that are \\"far worse\\". NBCUniversal's news division does not have access to the archives of the series. Another Apprentice producer, Chris Nee, claimed on Twitter that Trump said \\"the N-word\\" in the archived footage. Nee later deleted the tweet. A GoFundMe campaign was launched on October 9 with the goal of raising $5.1 million to release more tapes. The campaign is known as the \\"Trump Sunlight Campaign\\". Nee wrote on Twitter to Mark Cuban that there is a $5 million penalty fee if the footage is leaked.There's A GoFundMe To Get Trump's Supposedly Damning 'Apprentice' Tapes Released A few days later, the campaign managed to raise just over $32,000.

In June 2013 the Research Consortium selected Newcastle upon Tyne as a Demonstration City partly in response to the June 'Toon Monsoon' in 2012. A Blue-Green City aims to reconfigure the urban water cycle to resemble a naturally-oriented water cycle while contributing to the amenity of the city by bringing water management and green infrastructure together.Hoyer, J., Dickhaut, W., Kronawitter, L., & Weber, B. (2011). \\"Water sensitive urban design: principles and inspiration for sustainable stormwater management in the city of the future\\" (pp. 1-118). Berlin: Jovis. This is achieved by combining and protecting the hydrological and ecological values of the urban landscape while providing resilient and adaptive measures to address future changes in climate, land use, water management, and socio-economic activity in the city. A Blue-Green City is more than the blue and green infrastructure that it comprises; it is a holistic concept that requires collaboration between government, industry and public stakeholders and partnerships working to be fully implemented. Blue-Green Cities generate a multitude of environmental, ecological, socio-cultural and economic benefits through integrated planning and managementLawson, E., Thorne, C., Ahilan, S., Allen, D., Arthur, S., Everett, G., Fenner, R., Glenis, V., Guan, D., Hoang, L. and Kilsby, C. (2014). Delivering and evaluating the multiple flood risk benefits in blue-green cities: An interdisciplinary approach. D., Proverbs, & CA, Brebbia (eds), Flood recovery, innovation and response IV, 113-124. and may be key to future resilience and sustainability of urban environments and processes. In addition to making the urban environment more resilient to flood and drought events, a Blue-Green City is designed to maximise the use of water as a resource, e.g. through rainwater harvesting, irrigation of river channels, groundwater recharge and as a local amenity. Water is preferentially attenuated and stored on the surface to maximise the potential environmental and social benefits, and reduce stress on the subsurface piped sewer system. A Blue-Green City also aims to collect and store water during flood events for later use in times of drought. = Background on the study = Blue-Green Cities aim to reintroduce the natural water cycle into urban environments and provide effective measures to manage fluvial (river), coastal, and pluvial (urban runoff or surface water) flooding while championing the concept of multi-functional green space and land use to generate multiple benefits for the environment, society, and the economy. Visible water in cities has massively declined in the last century and many areas are facing future water scarcity in response to changes in climate, land use and population. The concept of Blue-Green Cities involves working with green and blue infrastructure components to secure a sustainable future and generate multiple benefits for the environmental, ecological, social and cultural spheres. This requires a coordinated approach to water resource and green space management from institutional organisations, industry, academia and local communities and neighbourhoods. The natural water cycle is characterised by high evaporation, a high rate of infiltration, and low surface runoff. This typically occurs in rural areas with abundant permeable surfaces (soils, green space), trees and vegetation, and natural meandering water courses. In contrast, in most urban environments there is more surface runoff, less infiltration and less evaporation. Green and blue spaces are often disconnected. Meaning for a city to be Blue-Green, it requires a further step beyond the implementation of blue and green infrastructure. The lack of infiltration in urban environments may reduce the amount of groundwater, which can have significant implications in some cities that experience drought. In urban environments water is quickly transported over the impermeable concrete, spending little time on the surface before being redirected underground into a network of pipes and sewers. However, these conventional systems (‚Äògrey‚Äô infrastructure) may not be sustainable, particularly in light of potential future climate change. They may be highly expensive and lack many of the multiple benefits associated with Blue-Green infrastructure. Newcastle Blue-Green Cities Learning and Action Alliance members. Displaying the variety of stakeholders consulted in a Blue- Green city project. From open access journal article: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2017.10.013Land planning and engineering design approaches in Blue-Green Cities aim to be cost effective, resilient, adaptable, and help mitigate against future climate change, while minimising environmental degradation and improving aesthetic and recreational appeal. Key functions in Blue-Green Cities include protecting natural systems and restoring natural drainage channels, mimicking pre-development hydrology, reducing imperviousness, and increasing infiltration, surface storage and the use of water retentive plants. A key factor is interlinking the blue and green assets to create Blue-Green corridors through the urban environment. Blue- Green Cities favour the holistic approach and aim for interdisciplinary cooperation in water management, urban design, and landscape planning. Community understanding, interaction and involvement in the evolution of Blue- Green design are actively promoted(e.g. Newcastle's LAA). Blue-Green Cities typically incorporate sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS), a term used in the United Kingdom, known as water-sensitive urban design (WSUD) in Australia, and low impact development or best management practice (BMP) in the United States. Green infrastructure is also a term that is used to define many of the infrastructure components for flood risk management in Blue-Green Cities. Water management components in Blue-Green Cities are part of a wider complex ‚Äúsystem of systems‚Äù providing vital services for urban communities. The urban water system interacts with other essential infrastructure such as information and telecommunications, energy, transport, health and emergency services. Blue-Green Cities aim to minimise the negative impacts on these systems during times of extreme flood while maximising the positive interactions when the system is in the non-flood state. Key barriers to effective implementation of Blue-Green infrastructure can arise if planning processes and wider urban system design and urban renewal programmes are not fully integrated. = Components of a Blue-Green City = A Blue-Green City actively works with existing grey infrastructure to provide optimal management of the urban water system during a range of flood events; from no flood, to minimal flooding, to extreme rainfall events where the drainage system may be exceeded.CIRA. (2006) \\"Designing for exceedance in urban drainage - good practice (C635)\\" Due to these holistic and practical ideals, many infrastructure components and common practices may be employed when planning and developing a Blue-Green City, in line with specific local objectives, e.g. water management, delivery of multi-functional green infrastructure, biodiversity action plans. The key functions of Blue-Green infrastructure components include water use/reuse, water treatment, detention and infiltration, conveyance, evapotranspiration, local amenity provision, and generation of a range of viable habitats for local ecosystems. In most cases, the components are multi-functional. Blue-Green infrastructure includes: * Bioretention systems * Bioretention swales * Swales and buffer strips * Storage ponds, lakes and reservoirs * Controlled storage areas, e.g. car parks, recreational areas, minor roads, playing fields, parkland and hard standing in school playgrounds and industrial areas * Green roofsHoang, L., & Fenner, R.

As a concept, Blue- Green Cities accept the need for grey infrastructure in certain scenarios to maximise the benefits accrued. A wide range of environmental, ecological, economic and socio-cultural benefits are directly and indirectly attributed to Blue-Green Cities. Many benefits are realised during times of no flood (green benefits), giving Blue-Green Cities a competitive edge over otherwise comparable, conventional cities. Multi-functional infrastructure is a key to generating the maximum benefits when the system is in the non-flood state. An ecosystem services approach is frequently used to determine the benefits people obtain from the environment and ecosystems. Many of the good and services provided by Blue-Green Cities have economic value, e.g. the production of clean air, water and carbon sequestration. The benefits include; * Climate change adaptation and mitigation * Reduction of the urban heat island effect * Better management of stormwater and water supply, conservation of water resources through efficiency (increasing the resilience to drought) * Carbon reduction/mitigation * Improved air quality * Increased biodiversity (including the reintroduction and propagation of native species) * Habitat and biodiversity enhancement * Water pollution control * Public amenity (recreational water use, parks and recreation grounds, leisure) * Cultural services (physical and mental health, well-being of citizens, aesthetics, spiritual)Dreiseit, H. (2015) \\"Blue-green social place-making: Infrastructures for sustainable cities\\" Journal of Urban Regeneration and Renewal. 8. 161-170. * Community engagement * Education * Landscaping and quality of place * Increased land and property values * Labour productivity (stress reduction, attracting and retaining staff) * Economic growth and investment * Food production * Healthy soils and a reduction in soil erosion and river bank retreat * Tourism * Reduction in the accumulation of sediment, debris and pollutants in Urban watercourses * Shading and shelter around rivers and the wider urban environment * Economic benefits related to avoided costs from flooding * Community cohesion and greater understanding of sustainable planning and lifestyle * Possible diversification of the local economy and job creation * Strengthening ecosystem resilience * Ecological corridors and landscape permeability (biodiversity benefits) * Avoided impacts of flood events, including avoided damage to the economy, wildlife, buildings and infrastructure, and avoided trauma and distress (mental health impacts) associated with flooding The multiple benefits of adopting Blue-Green infrastructure will span both the local/regional and global/international scales. The Department of Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs‚Äô (DEFRA) approach to flood and coastal risk management has been to seek multi- functional benefits from Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management (FCERM) interventions and enhance the clarity of social and environmental consequences in the decision making process. DEFRA note, however, that flood risk reduction benefits provided by ecosystems are not well understood and this is an area where more systematic research is needed such as the SWITCH project. Work Package 4 of the Blue Green Cities Project involved the creation of a multiple benefit analysis GIS tool box which complements BeST SuDS management tools. The package normalises different Blue-Green benefits so that different scales of benefit can be analysed together thus allowing a quantification of all the potential benefits of new infrastructure. = Blue-Green cities case studies = Concepts of water sensitive cities, such as Blue-Green cities, and tools for water-centric urban design are developing in many countries.Howe, C. and Mitchell, C. 2012. \\"Water Sensitive Cities\\". IWA Publishing, London. For developed cities this may be a case of small changes and building back better with progressive redevelopment.Doloman, N. (2020). \\"Engineering Blue-Green Cities\\" ICE Midlands Webinar. https://www.ice.org.uk/eventarchive/engineering- blue-green-cities-webinar. For developing cities the process may be much quicker and circumvent the outdated sewage systems in older cities. Few, if any UK cities have progressed beyond ‚Äúthe drained city‚Äú stage, with water managed for a series of single functions (including flood risk management), mostly through distribution, collection and treatment systems and drainage infrastructure that are energy intensive and which continue to degrade urban environments in general and urban watercourses, in particular. International case studies and the Newcastle demonstration city show the potential of blue green cities in a variety of contexts. The research consortium led by Colin intends to lead a shift in urban developments to reach the potential shown in these case studies.  Newcastle upon Tyne Demonstration City  Newcastle was chosen as a demonstration city for the Blue-Green cities Project due to links with Newcastle University and its Estates, the 2012 flood events and the vulnerability of the city centre to further flash floods.Newcastle City Council. (2013). \\"The Newburn culvert collapse and citywide flooding: a review of extreme events in Newcastle 2012\\" Available at: https://www.newcastle.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Flooding/extreme_events_scrutiny_review_2012%20accessible.pdf Retrieved 25.06.2020 A high percentage of the city centre is impermeable and often unable to cope with high volumes of rain over short periods. A combination of the surface water management plan and community led Learning and Action Alliance was used to select detailed areas to study. These were the middle Ouseburn, Newcastle Great Park and the urban core and adjoining residential area of Wingrove. SuDS were shown to positively reduce flooding in the Newcastle Great park housing estate and the CityCat flood simulations can be viewed. SuDS were also shown to retain as much as 54% of the suspended sediment that is transported into the ponds, instead of pushing it downstream into the Ouseburn. On top of the ecosystem services benefit to carbon sequestration and habitat size, and reduce air pollution, noise and flood risk the Blue-Green city concept was shown to have successfully created resident approval. 90% of residents‚Äô surveyed (299 total responses) like the SuDS ponds and 61% understand the role of the ponds in reducing flood risk. Multi-benefit analysis was carried out for Wingrove and Newcastle's urban core using the Multiple benefit tool box created by the research consortium. Evaluation showed that potentially Blue-Green infrastructure in Wingrove would reduce noise and air pollution, increase carbon sequestration and habitat size, and improve access to greenspace for residents. This increase in green space could create a network of blue-green space throughout the city. Showing that despite the impressive improvements already made, there are further potential gains from implementing the Blue-Green city concept in Newcastle.  Portland, USA  The Consortium studied the development of the city Portland, to question whether it fit the Blue-Green city concept. It was decided that Portland has advanced into a world-leading Blue Green city through the ‚ÄòGrey to Green‚Äô initiative at the turn of the century. This led to a sustainable storm water plan which incorporated Green roofs, tree planting and Green streets.Environmental services City of Portland. 2013. \\"2013 Stormwater Management Facility Monitoring Report\\".https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bes/article/563749. Retrieved 22-06-2020. Monitoring reports commissioned suggest that eco-roofs have halved discharge into sewage/stormwater drains. This project was combined with new grey infrastructure in the form of the ‚ÄúBig pipe‚Äù project to compliment Blue Green infrastructure and ensure it is not overwhelmed by larger events making the city more sustainable in the long run. On top of the Blue-Green infrastructure, a cultural shift has been integral to Portland‚Äôs classification as a Blue Green city. This cultural shift is visible in the community led approach to sustainable development and water planning, such as the Foster Green Ecodistrict.Foster Green Steering Committee. 2012. \\"Foster Green EcoDistrict Assessment\\" https://ecodistricts.org/wp- content/uploads/2013/05/Foster-Green-EcoDistrict-Assessment-Final- Report-2012-0316.pdf Retrieved 22-06-2020 To solidify these shifts requires normalisation of Blue-Green techniques being used by design companies, such as Greenworks who carried out the Johnson Creek Oxbow restoration carried out in metropolitan Portland.  Rotterdam, Netherlands  Rotterdam is a good example of where the Blue-Green cities process has been initiated with the ideal of climate proofing a city. There has been a repositioning to use water as an opportunity and a resource which has changed perspectives, opening opportunities to manage water better for both flooding and consumption. A variety of innovative solutions have been used in Rotterdam to maximise water management whilst reducing the impacts of developments, which with traditional hard engineering could be costly both economically and spatially. These include a strong push towards increasing water storage with Green roofs and water squares. The latter of these doubles up as basin storage during flood events. Traditional methods have also been redeveloped towards the blue-green city goal. These include increasing the multi-functionality of dykes, which are needed to reinforce the city against sea level rise, and now have amenities built into their return face. The combination of flood defences, open green space and urban redevelopment have increased the sustainability of this process and opportunities for funding. The risk of Climate change to a delta city like Rotterdam assisted the cultural shift towards a Blue-Green city with future projects such as Rotterdam weather encouraging grants and public participation in city gardens and more sustainable living practices.  Urban Flood Resilience Research Project (2016-2020)  Thorne currently leads the Urban Flood Resilience research project (2016-2020), also funded by the EPSRC. A paper was recently published that presents an overview of the consortium and its research.  The Gravel Bed Rivers Workshop (1980-present)  Colin Thorne played a part in the creation of the Gravel Bed Rivers Workshop which has been running every 5 years since 1980 and is one of the editors in the first three Gravel-Bed Rivers books written after each of these workshops. The Workshops are designed to present an authoritative review of recent progress in understanding the morphology and processes in gravel bed rivers and each has an accompanying book or special issue journal. \\\\- 1980 Gravel Bed Rivers Workshop 1: \\"Fluvial Processes, Engineering and Management of gravel bed rivers\\" United Kingdom \\\\- 1985 Gravel Bed Rivers Workshop 2: \\"Sediment Transport in gravel bed rivers\\" Colorado State, USA \\\\- 1990 Gravel Bed Rivers Workshop 3: \\"Dynamics of gravel bed rivers\\" Florence \\\\- 1995 Gravel Bed Rivers Workshop 4: \\"Gravel bed Rivers in the environment\\" Washington State, USAKlingeman, P.

Mount St Helens and the North Fork Toutle River  Professor Thorne has been involved in research around the impact of the 1980 Mount St Helens eruption and the long term impact of the associated debris avalanche on the North Fork Toutle River. The eruption dramatically increased sediment yields and led to the creation of a sediment retention structure. = System Response = A lot of Thorne‚Äôs work has focused on how, over time, the system has responded to the complete resetting of the topography and environment. The Alluvial Phase Space Diagram was created to attempt to define how the channel has changed. Moreover, the rate law approach was suggested as a method to understand fluvial response to a major, instantaneous disturbance. = Sediment Management Plan = Thorne has been part of a team which suggested a phased sediment management plan to help downstream communities cope with the long lasting impacts which have resulted from the eruption. Where possible this plan only uses dredging as a last resort in order to reduce ecological and economic costs. = Links to other research = The stream evolution model which Thorne co-developed has been applied to the North Fork Toutle in order to classify reaches under the different stream stages set out in the model. = University of Nottingham Field Trip = Thorne has led field trips for physical geography students from the University of Nottingham to measure channel responses in the North Fork Toutle River. Part of the practical river restoration and management module.  Lower Mississippi River Research Projects  = Analysis of Suspended Sediment Transport data (2000) = Thorne was the principle investigator for an analysis of suspended sediment transport data compiled by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USGS).Thorne, C., Harmar, O. and Wallerstein, N., 2000. 'Sediment Transport In The Lower Mississippi River: Final Report'. London: U.S. Army Research, Development and Standardisation Group-U.K. Available at: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235114043_Sediment_Transport_in_the_Lower_Mississippi_River [Accessed 1 June 2020]. The final report found that the suspended component of bed material load constitutes only a small percentage of total suspended load, this percentage increased with discharge. Coarse suspended sediment concentrations were also found to have a stronger positive relationship with discharge than fine sediment concentrations. No temporal trends were found when analysing this set of data.  Recommendations  Thorne went on to make 6 recommendations in the final report: # Data collection needed to continue into the foreseeable future to support analysis and prediction of morphological evolution, which is a result of sediment transfer and deposition. # Data analysts and data gathers should consult on any changes in collection procedure, so that data collected is suitable for the questions under investigation. # The report called for co-ordination between sample sites so that comparisons could be enhanced between these sites. # The investigators were concerned with the limitations of predicting sediment movement at high flows beyond the dataset. Therefore, it recommended consideration of an advanced, strategic sampling program for the Lower Mississippi River to replace the present routine sampling program. # Future size gradations of all measured suspended sediment load samples should be pre- determined. If possible, suspended sediment loads should be synthesised from bed material gradations in historical datasets. # Finally, the report recommended the consideration of a trial program to measure bed material load in the Lower Mississippi Basin. This could ascertain the contribution of bed load to bed material transport, responsible for driving morphological evolution and response in the system. = Future River Analysis and Management Evaluation (2016-21) = Colin is currently involved in an Inter-disciplinary study to develop a hybrid numerical/rules-based model capable of forecasting future channel changes in the Lower Mississippi River triggered by changes in external drivers and controls of channel form and function. This model is being developed based on the existing HEC-RAS/SIAM and POTAMOD models. = Mississippi River, mid-Batararia and mid-Breton Diversion projects (2018-19) = Colin Thorne provide Expert support on geomorphic and sediment aspects of designing intake and control structures through the Mississippi River for the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority of Louisiana. This project will rebuild, sustain, and maintain land currently subject to erosion in that part of the Mississippi Delta.  UK Environment Agency  = Severn-Trent Region (1994-1999) = Strategic project, on the River Idle, to design river rehabilitation structures to enhance the physical environment and aesthetics of a regulated, channelised lowland river. The project \\"rehabilitation design was required to tackle these deficiencies through improvements which did not compromise the other obligations of the managing authority.\\" The project focused on the need for hydraulic modelling to clearly identify restoration techniques would not increase flood risk. The main types of restoration introduced into the study site were flow deflectors to increase hydraulic and sediment heterogeneity, these were then measured using BENDFLOW, HMODEL2, FCFA and HEC-RAS to find the optimum positions and impacts on flow. = Wessex Region =  Fluvial audit of the Hawkcombe Stream (2002)  A fluvial audit of the Hawkcombe Stream was carried out in 2002.Thorne, C.R. and Skinner, K.S. (2002) \\"Hawkcombe Stream ‚Äì Fluvial Audit, prepared for the Environment Agency South West\\" Nottingham University Consultants Limited: Nottingham. The site was of interest due to flooding in the town of Porlock as a result of sediment dynamics from the proximal upland reaches of the stream. The results of the study have also been presented and are available on the River Restoration Centre websitePriestnall, G., Skinner, K. and Thorne, C. (2003) \\"Interactive mapping for communicating the results of a fluvial audit\\" Available at: https://www.therrc.co.uk/sites/default/files/files/Conference/2003/presentations/priestnall_skinner_thorne.pdf Retrieved 2020-06-05.  Sediment Management Plan for the Hawkcombe Stream (2006-2010)  Colin used the iSIS hydrodynamic model to construct a sediment management plan for the Hawkcombe Stream. He remained a consultant to modify flood defence measures so that they would interact better with sediment dynamics.Balkham, M., Fosbeary, C., Kitchen, A. and Rickard, C. (2010). Culvert design and operation guide. CIRIA: London. Colin also helped to develop River Energy Auditing Scheme (REAS) on the Hawkcombe stream which classifies reaches into sediment sources, pathways or sinks in order to understand how sediment dynamics will impact proposed flood management schemes. The understanding of sediment sink reaches was later developed into the stage-0 restoration concept.  BP pipeline river crossings  = BTC Pipeline (2003-2004) = Professor Colin Thorne undertook a rapid geomorphological assessment of potential channel instability at points where the Baku Tbilisi Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline crossed river channels.BP.

Colin provided Rapid geomorphological assessment of potential for channel instability at the two major river crossings in 2010/11.  Mekong River Commission (2010-2011)  Colin Thorne led the Sediment Expert Group responsible for reviewing compliance with Mekong River Commission Preliminary Design Guidance on sediment management and potential impacts on sediments, morphology and nutrient balance in the Mekong River that might stem from construction and operation of a main stream dam at Xayaburi in the Lao People's Democratic Republic.Colin, T., Annandale, G., Jorgen, J., Jensen, E., Green, T. and Koponen, J.

It was recommended that modifications be made to the dam design and operating strategy to avoid or mitigate adverse trans-boundary and cumulative impacts. These recommendations were accepted and acted upon in a $100 million package to allow sediment periodically out of the reservoir.  China-UK joint flood study (2007-11)  Colin was part of a collaborative study of present and future flood risks in the Taihu Basin, China involving multidisciplinary work and work packages on hydrology, hydraulics, infrastructure, socio-economics and risk modelling. The UK Foresight Future Flooding approach was used identifying drivers of increased flood risk and ranking them according to their importance in contributing to future flooding. The qualitative and quantitative analyses provided a comprehensive vision of possible future flood risk to inform policy development and decision making. The project was lead jointly by the Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research (IWHR) in Beijing, and the University of Nottingham, UK. The project was funded in the United Kingdom by the Government Office for Science, DEFRA, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the United Nations Department for Economic and Social Affairs and the Natural Environment Research Council. The lessons learnt in applying the UK Flood Foresight approach in to a different context has been shown to have learning opportunities and implications for flood management in the UK.Surendran, S.S., Meadowcroft, I.C., Evans, E.P. (2010) \\"What Lessons can we learn from Chinese Foresight project for long term investment planning?\\" Environment Agency: Telford. Moreover, a framework was developed for continued long term flooding scenario analysis in China as a result of the project.  \\"Stage Zero\\" Restoration  Thorne's work on the Stream Evolution Model has led to the application of Stage Zero, otherwise known as \\"valley floor resetting\\", as a river restoration technique. Along with the Upper Deschutes Watershed Council, Thorne has been involved in the Stage Zero restoration of Whychus creek which has created an anastomosing channel in an effort to support increased numbers of anadromous and resident fish, improve stream habitat and expanded biodiversity.Mathias, Perle., Lauren, Mork. and Colin, Thorne.

Hendershott's defense attorney attempted to introduce evidence that Hendershott suffered from a mental disorder causing impulse control to counter that defendant had a guilty mind (mens rea). The evidence was excluded because of a statute that evidence of mental impairment short of legal insanity may be offered as bearing on capacity to form a specific intent.

A new church was built for the St James' congregation at northern end of St James Road in 1968.http://www.stjohnse15.co.uk/history/timeline/timeline16.html The congregation finally moved to St Paul's Church, Stratford in 2014, though the area that had formerly been St James' parish was instead transferred from St John's to St Saviour's the same year.http://www.stjohnse15.co.uk/history/timeline/timeline18.html  References  James James Category:1882 establishments in England Category:1966 disestablishments in England Category:19th-century Church of England church buildings ","title":"St James' Church, Forest Gate"},{"id":"51910147","text":"The Oyster Bay Range Front Lighthouse is located on the coast of Dar es salaam, Tanzania in Oyster Bay.

Tryon announced he would retire at the end of his term, four Republican candidates contested to replace him in the 2016 election, although one of those candidates withdrew and endorsed Skillicorn. Skillicorn won the primary with 37.1% of the vote. He won the general election on November 8, 2016 with 57.6% of the vote. Skillicorn was sworn in on January 11, 2017. In 2018, Skillicorn won the Republican primaries for his district. No Democrats filed, so he ran unopposed. Skillicorn endorsed Libertarian Party candidate Kash Jackson for Governor or Illinois.https://www.nwherald.com/2018/10/22/rep- skillicorn-backs-kash-jackson-in-race-for-governor/ai95tg5/ Effort to Recall Governor Citing troubles with the Illinois Department of Employment Security website, Skillicorn launched a recall effort to remove Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker from office. Skillicorn said fellow Republican House members Brad Halbrook, Blaine Wilhour, and Darren Bailey agreed to sign the petition. All three had expressed dissatisfaction with the Governor's stay-at- home order. When asked about the effort, Pritzker blamed Skillicorn, his party, and former Republican Governor Bruce Rauner for a two year budget impasse that left the Illinois Department of Employment Security without necessary funding.

The current organization began in 1993, when the Louisville Free Public Library, owner of WFPL and WFPK, along with the University of Louisville, which owned WUOL-FM, collectively transferred the licenses of the three stations to the community-licensed Public Radio Partnership.

WFPL, long the flagship NPR station in Kentuckiana, found it difficult to make room on its schedule for both the new programming and the jazz, bluegrass and blues music that had been a staple on the station for years. At the same time, both WUOL and WFPK aired classical music in a market that was nowhere near large enough to support two classical music stations. After two years of talks, the stations launched a major format overhaul that took effect on-air on January 8, 1996. WUOL became the sole outlet for classical music in Louisville, in part due to its longstanding ties with U of L's School of Music. WFPL turned its focus to news and talk, ceding its entire recorded music inventory and most of its music-based programming to WFPK, which became a Triple-A station. In 2000, the stations jointly moved their operations to the former Electric Building in downtown Louisville. Eight years later, the group changed its trade name to the current Louisville Public Media. In 2013, Louisville Public Media created the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting (KyCIR), a nonprofit newsroom focused on investigative journalism.

The film was released in a limited release and through video on demand on October 7, 2016, by IFC Films. Plot In the 1970s, Shay Baker (Daniel Huttlestone) is a 14-year-old boy from a working-class family in Wanstead. He divides his time between looking after his little sister Alice and working at the piano shop owned by his father Nick (Dougray Scott). His mother left the family years before, and, according to Nick, lives a bohemian, hedonistic life in London. Nick sends Shay to pick up parts from a music supplier in London. On the train, Shay meets Vivian (Nell Williams), a punk girl listening to The Clash on her Walkman. Shay becomes fascinated by the band, and follows Vivian through London. Vivian explains the politics of punk, with The Clash supporting racial cooperation and working-class empowerment, whereas the skinheads advocate white power and support the neo-Nazi National Front. Vivian and Shay manage to get the last two tickets to a Clash concert for the following day. After returning home to Wanstead, Shay spends the night listening to the Clash's eponymous album, dying his hair from a light-brown mop-top to a black pompadour. He also begins to wear clothes influenced by punk culture: black jeans, red button-down shirts, and a leather jacket. Nick becomes injured in an accident moving a piano and is hospitalized. Shay, wanting to go the concert, puts Alice to bed and leaves. He and Vivian attend the concert, where they kiss at the end of \\"Clash City Rockers\\". The concert is interrupted by skinheads and police, and Shay is beaten by a police officer while defending Vivian. Shay arrives home to find Alice gone, but finds that she had gone to a neighbor's house after finding herself alone. Because of Nick's injuries, Shay finds the family falling behind on their payments. Shay decides to look after the shop as well as drive his father's taxi to make extra money while Vivian looks after Alice. With her help, Shay disguises himself as a woman to look old enough to drive. Late that night, he unknowingly picks up Joe Strummer (Jonathan Rhys Meyers). Strummer discovers Shay isn't a woman, and Shay confesses. They begin to talk about Shay's situation and his love of The Clash, still unaware of the identity of his passenger. Strummer gives him all the money in his wallet to pay for his fare. Shay returns home, and he and Vivian spend the night together. Shay wakes the next morning to find Vivian gone, and Alice is sick. He also finds that the water and telephone lines are shut off, so he drives to his mother's London flat for help. As Alice rests, Shay discovers his mother's lifestyle as a singer, including sexual promiscuity and use of cocaine. Shay returns to the shop and discovers that he's been served with an eviction notice. In an attempt to get help from Vivian, he discovers that she actually comes from an upper-class family, living a comfortable life in a posh neighborhood in London, leading Shay to feel betrayed. Shay, along with his mother's lover Johnny (Tom Hughes), goes to a concert in Victoria Park sponsored by the Anti- Nazi League to see The Clash again. In a violent confrontation between punks and skinheads, Shay is detained and thrown in jail. He soon finds himself sharing a cell with Joe Strummer, who recognizes him from the taxi. After they are released, Strummer takes Shay to see The Clash rehearse some new material. Shay recognizes that his mother's behavior is not suitable, and leaves with Alice. However, he finds that the taxi has been repossessed by the taxi company. In an attempt to raise money and pay off his family's debts, Shay sells the shop's pianos and converts it into a music store known as the Rock Shop, specializing in guitars and amplifiers. Even though he hasn't told Strummer about it, he advertises that The Clash would be playing at the grand opening of the Rock Shop. Nick is discharged from the hospital, and becomes angry when he discovers what Shay had done. Shay leaves home to spend the night at the shop, but discovers Vivian sitting on the sidewalk wanting to be first in line to see The Clash play. They reconcile and sleep on the shop floor. The following morning, they discover a crowd of punks has formed outside wanting to see The Clash. Nick and Alice arrive at the shop, with Nick approving of his son's work, saying that it should have been done a long time ago. Shay tries to appease the crowd, but Nick tells everyone that The Clash aren't coming. Just then, Joe Strummer emerges from the crowd with a guitar and plays \\"I Fought the Law\\" as the credits roll.

It tells a story of transient loves and willed deaths, in which a callow young man abandons an older woman and loses a wiser friend. Plot Paul, a young sculptor in Paris who is having an affair with H√©l√®ne, a married woman in her fifties, goes to Italy for the unveiling of one of his works. There he meets the laconic Serge, a man in his fifties who is returning alone to Paris in his red Porsche 911 and agrees to take Paul. The two develop a friendship as the immature Paul, who uses recreational drugs, learns from the life story of the world-weary Serge. In fact, viewers learn, Serge's hardened exterior hides his intention of ending his life by taking pills. Back in Paris, when Paul walks H√©l√®ne home after a session in his room, she asks him up to meet her husband. As the husband talks to Paul, she gets increasingly tense and suddenly breaks a wineglass, using a shard to slash her wrist. Paul rigs up a tourniquet while the husband fetches a doctor, who pronounces her safe. When Serge tells Paul he is driving to Berlin, Paul agrees to ride with him. In the city, Paul picks up a whore while Serge goes to a cemetery. There he visits a grave, which viewers can assume to be that of his wife who committed suicide. Returning to Paris, when Serge drops Paul off outside his building at 11pm, H√©l√®ne is waiting on the pavement. The three agree to go to a Chinese restaurant but, when they are served, Paul gets up and goes home. Left alone, Serge and H√©l√®ne admit that they like being together. Serge walks her to a hotel nearby, on the way buying some pills at a late-night pharmacy. After they have made love, the first time for Serge since his wife died, he goes home and takes the pills.

Located on the Mississippi River, Huntington was an important shipping location. History The settlement was first called \\"Wilkerson\\" and \\"Wilkerson's Landing\\". Oscar L. Shelby was an early settler who moved to the area in the 1870s. Shelby was a merchant and landowner, and much of the town was built on his estate. Shelby later became a member of the Mississippi House of Representatives. Wilkerson had a small store and some cottage homes. In 1885, the \\"Arkansas City Branch\\" of the Louisville, New Orleans and Texas Railway was completed to Wilkerson. The name of the settlement was changed to \\"Huntington\\" to honor railroad magnate Collis Potter Huntington, who founded the Columbus and Greenville Railway. The railway was built to this location because Huntington was directly across the Mississippi River from Arkansas City, Arkansas, which was the terminus of the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway (StLIM&S;). A ferry owned by the StLIM&S; would carry goods and railroad cars across the river. From 1885 to 1903, Huntington had a post office. Huntington was incorporated on March 6, 1886. That same year, a large sawmill was established which supplied timber for local trade and to construct most of the buildings in Huntington. It was described that at Huntington, \\"bunco men, crap shooters, all kinds of gamblers...gathered from all parts of the country--Greenville, Vicksburg, Leland, etc.\\", and that \\"on levee workers' paydays...a crowd of 200 men and women quickly gathered for gambling and drinking\\", after which \\"fights commenced\\". Huntington was flooded in 1890, 1897, and 1903. Although Huntington no longer exists, several nearby geographic features retain its name. A large body of land (on which the settlement was located) is now called \\"Huntington Point\\"; a sand bar in the Mississippi River is called \\"Huntington Bar\\"; a levee on the north shore of Huntington Point is called \\"Huntington Point Revetment\\"; and the location of the former settlement is accessible from \\"North Huntington Point Road\\".

Biography  He was born to a wealthy family. An illness he had when he was a small child left him deaf and without speech.Brief biography @ Culture.pl. At the age of seven, he entered the \\"\\" and showed an early talent for drawing, which encouraged his parents to pay for private lessons. In 1901, he began his formal studies at the Krak√≥w Academy of Fine Arts, where he was a student of J√≥zef Mehoffer, Jan Stanis≈Çawski and Leon Wycz√≥≈Çkowski. He graduated in 1905 with a gold medal. Young Exiles Having been informed of the pogroms taking place in Odessa, he went there to document the events with a series of drawings. After that, he made a study trip through Germany and Austria and returned to Warsaw. He stayed for only a short time however, then went to Paris in 1908, where he got married and decided to settle permanently, although he frequently went back to Poland to participate in open-air painting workshops in Kazimierz Dolny, Sniatyn and Kra≈õnik. His paintings were exhibited in Vilnius and ≈Å√≥d≈∫, as well as at the Zachƒôta. In early November of 1930, he went to Argentina to help prepare the first overseas exhibition of his paintings. Later that month, unable to hear the honking of an oncoming taxi, he was struck and killed. The exhibition was presented as a posthumous tribute to his work, under the aegis of the Jewish Association of Argentina. In 1931, a committee was established to raise funds for the purchase of his works. In 1942, a great majority of his works were auctioned off. Most were purchased by the \\"Fundaci√≥n IWO\\" (the Argentine branch of YIVO) and were stored at the Asociaci√≥n Mutual Israelita Argentina.

Conservation banking can be viewed as a method of mitigation that allows permitting agencies to target various natural resources typically of value or concern, and it is generally contemplated as a protection technique to be implemented before the valued resource or species will need to be mitigated. The ESA prohibits the \\"taking\\" of fish and wildlife species which are officially listed as endangered or threatened in their populations. However, under section 7(a)(2) for Federal Agencies, and under section 10(a) for private parties, a take may be permissible for unavoidable impacts if there are conservation mitigation measures for the affected species or habitat. Purchasing ‚Äúcredits‚Äù through a conservation bank is one such mitigation measure to remedy the loss. Conservation banks are permanently protected parcels of land with inherent abilities to harbor, preserve, and manage the survival of endangered and threatened species, along with their critical habitat. This allows the acquisition and protection of the parcels of land prior to future loss or disturbance to valued resources. Banks are often considered to be the more ecologically efficient option for mitigation because they generally incorporate larger tracts of land that enables higher quality habitat and range connectivity, thereby creating a stronger chance of survival and sustainability for the species. Rather than have developments offset their effects by conserving small areas of habitat, conservation banking allows pooling multiple mitigation resources into a larger reserve. The intention of conservation banking is to create a no-net loss of the intended resources. Conservation banking may be used by various entitles as a method of species and habitat protection, as long as it is approved by the permitting agency.  Background  = Mitigation = Mitigation is the preservation of natural resources in order to offset unavoidable impacts to similar resources. Conservation banking mitigation is specific to species and their habitat which are protected under the Endangered Species Act. There are two other forms of mitigation besides conservation banking, including in-lieu fee and permittee- responsible programs. In-Lieu fee programs allows a permittee to contribute money into a United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) approved fund in lieu of implementing their own mitigation. To date, In-Lieu fee programs have only applied to wetlands. The sponsor of the fund then implements an appropriate mitigation project when enough money has been collected through the fund. In these situations, the fund sponsor is fully liable for the success of the mitigation. The second alternative form of mitigation is the Permittee-Responsible program, which allows the permittee takes on implementation and assumes liability for their own mitigation project to offset effects. = Benefits = There is generally greater security associated with a conservation bank. This is due to the stringent performance standards imposed on bank owners by the USFWS, which also requires them to have adequate funding into perpetuity, and to have long term management plans. Purchasing of credits by the easement holder from the landowner creates a legal contract, known as a conservation easement. The conservation easement binds the landowner to uphold the requirements of the conservation bank. Another advantage is that purchasing credits from a conservation bank ensures that species and/or habitat protection is already in place before the impact occurs. In addition, liability for habitat and species mitigation success is shifted to the conservation bank owner is a benefit to the developer or permittee.  History  Conservation banking is derived from wetland mitigation banks that were created in the early 1990s. Through Federal agency efforts, mitigation banks were created to focus on preserving wetlands, streams, and other aquatic habitats or resources and offered compensatory mitigation credits to offset unavoidable effects on the habitats or resources under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. After the ‚ÄúFederal Guidance for the Establishment, Use, and Operation of Mitigation Banks (60 FR 5860558614)‚Äù was published in 1995, California contemporaneously led efforts to create conservation banks as to further increase regional conservation due to growing development threatening species and their habitat. Approval of conservation banks for various federally-listed species by the USFWS, in conjunction with other Federal agencies, began throughout the early 1990s. Collectively, the nation‚Äôs 130 conservation banks is equivalent to over 160,000 acres of permanently protected land. = Endangered Species Act Connection = Under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, endangered or threatened species and their respective critical habitat and geographical range are protected for conservation with efforts made to restore the species and habitat back to well-being. Under ESA Section 10(b), takings are permitted only if the taking is incidental and otherwise lawful activity but requires that effects be minimized and mitigated to the maximum extent practicable. For projects and development that will damage an at-risk species‚Äô habitat, such as reducing, modifying, or degrading its habitat, its permittees are required to mitigate the impact. Conservation banks act as a mechanism for compensation when a species or habitat is affected during development by providing credits that can be purchased by permitees to offset their negative impact.  Function  Conservation banking is a market program that increases the bank owner or landowner's stewardship and incentive for permanently protecting their land by providing them a set number of habitat or species credits that the respective owners are able to sell. In order to satisfy the requirements of a species or habitat conservation measures, these conservation credits can be sold to projects or developments that result in unavoidable and adverse impacts to species. Essentially, conservation banks offsite the cost to mitigate the loss or damage to a species and/or their habitat. Traditionally, preservation of some habitat area of an at-risk species were required by a project permitee during development. This could result in habitat that became isolated, small, with reduced connectivity or functionality, and was more costly to maintain. Comparatively, conservation banks are more cost effective as they are able to maintain larger blocks of land with greater functionality for a species, such as allowing habitat connectivity. For purchasers, this is also time-effective by allowing them to forgo their responsibility of handling on-or-off mitigation measures that can run into administrative delays due to the USFWS review and approval process. After the public or private party purchases credits, a bank transfer occurs between the project party and banker. The banker is then perpetually bound to conserve and manage the conservation bank.  Creation Process  In California, a multi-agency process oversees the review and approval of conservation banks by the Inter-agency Review Team, which can be composed of all or some of the following agencies; typically the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service, and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. After review and approval, the Inter-agency Review Team and conservation bank sponsor signs a legally-binding conservation bank enabling instrument, which details the responsibilities of each party and includes a management plan, endowment funding agreement, and other documents detailing the operations of the conservation bank. Unless the lands have been previously listed or designated for other conservation purposes, Private, Tribal, State, and local government lands are all considered eligible to be conservation banks. Agricultural lands, such as used for farming, ranching, timber operations, croplands or related, may be suitable for the establishment of a conservation bank if the special-status species habitat on-site is intact or restored; however, agricultural and forestry activities may need to be modified, reduced, or stopped entirely if necessary to protect the conservation values of the land. = Management Plan = Establishment of a bank requires a management plan that outlines necessary management activities and endowment funds. The intention of the plan is to describe the long-term management activities of the conservation bank. The plan describes restricted and allowed activities and provides guidance on all monitoring and reporting requirements. The minimal requirements of a management plan includes: # A full geophysical description of the site, including the area, geographical setting, neighboring land uses, and any relevant cultural or historic features located in the site. # Identifies the biological resources within the bank, such as a vegetation map. # Describes restricted and permitted activities that can occur on-site # The objectives and biological goals of the conservation bank is described. # All management activities are fully described for the conservation bank in order to meet the objectives and biological goals, such as necessary ecological restoration of its habitats, incorporation of public use and access, and budgeting requirements. # Necessary monitoring schedules, including special management plan activities. # If necessary, outlines how future management will occur, such as decision trees or similar. Creation of the bank must also include plans for remedial action in case bank owners are unable to fulfill their agreements. Remedial actions can include forfeiting the property to a third party to uphold the requirements of the bank or posting a bond valued equivalent to the property. Typically acts of nature, including earthquakes, floods, or fires, are excluded from liability of the bank owner.  Credits  Credits are essentially the currency of the conservation value associated with the habitat and/or species which may be affected by development. It is the ecological value of a species or habitat. The permitting agency is responsible for determining the credits available at any given bank, based on the number of species and the habitat characteristic for those species, on the land owned by the bank. They then allocate the appropriate number of credits to the bank owner, who can then establish the price through negotiation with agencies. Pricing of conservation credits are variable based on the type of species impacted through a developmental take. Additionally, the market forces of supply and demand largely dictate the price of any given credit, and the value may fluctuate based on many other economic factors such as land value, competition, and speculation about development in a certain habitat area. Current data suggests that conservation credits range in price from a low of $1500 per mitigation of a Gopher Tortoise to as much as $325,000 for vernal pool preservation.  Locations currently used  There are currently fourteen states and Saipan, the largest of the Northern Mariana Islands, with approved USFWS conservation banks. These states include Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Kansas, Maryland, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. Nationally, some species with the largest respective habitat coverage include: American burying beetle, California tiger salamander, California red-legged frog, calippe silverspot butterfly, Florida panther, golden-cheeked warbler, lesser prairie chicken, Utah prairie dog, valley elderberry longhorn beetle, vernal pool fairy shrimp, vernal pool tadpole shrimp. In 1995, California was the first state to create a conservation bank and continues to be the national leader in number of conservation banks, with over 30 established banks. Species benefited in these banks include the burrowing owl, coastal sage scrub, delta smelt, California giant garter snake, longfin smelt, California salmonids, San Bernardino kangaroo rat, San Joaquin kit fox, Santa Ana River Woollystar, Swainson's Hawk, and valley elderberry longhorn beetle. Examples of Californian habitats include ephemeral drainages, riparian zones, vernal pools, and wetlands.  Future outlook  Two pieces of recent legislation were created, which will likely affect the future of conservation banking. A draft of the Endangered Species Act Compensatory Mitigation Policy was proposed by the Department of Fish and Wildlife Service in September, 2016 with the intention to create a mechanism for the US Department of the Interior to comply with Executive order (80 FR 68743), which directs Federal agencies that manage natural resources ‚Äúto avoid and then minimize harmful effects to land, water, wildlife, and other ecological resources (natural resources) caused by land- or -water-disturbing activities‚Ä¶‚Äù This policy would provide guidance to the USFWS about planning and implementation of compensatory mitigation strategies. If adopted, the policy would require a shift from project-by-project compensatory mitigation approaches to broader, landscape oriented approaches such as conservation banking. In addition, the California legislature passed Assembly Bill 2087, which will enable large conservation goals to be achieved through the creation of advance mitigation credits associated with FWS Regional Conservation Investment Strategies (RCIS). This is important for the future of conservation banking because the bill allows for consideration of mitigation for impacts to wildlife and habitat in conservation strategy planning and decision making.

Born Maria de la Concepcion Josefa Ramona Ignacia Severa Lombardo, she was born in Mexico City to a wealthy family headed by her father, Francisco Maria Lombardo.  Education, marriage, and political life  Despite the unruly era in which she lived, she was strictly educated in a convent school, where she was taught catechism, needlework, and bordaje. She led a normal life, attending the theater, dances, parties, and taking lessons in singing and horse riding. She was orphaned in her early youth and left with few resources. She was linked romantically to an Englishman (and had to hide in a convent as a result) and then with Miguel Miramon, whom she met on a visit to the Military College when he was a lieutenant. As soon as Miramon reached the rank of major general he proposed marriage. Concepcion Lombardo and Miramon were married in 1858. They ultimately had six children. A year into the marriage, Miramon was elected president and Concepcion Lombardo became First Lady, which caused her much concern since she knew the fractured political and military situation facing Mexico. Nevertheless, she encouraged her husband to fight for their conservative ideals. From this date, she saw little of Miramon, as he had to continue his military campaign, and the protocol prevented her from accompanying him to either official ceremonies or social events. Mrs. Miramon was not allowed to sit next to him in the official box and had to dance with him at parties, because they were considered protag√≥nicas attitudes of a woman who wanted to feel the same relevance and authority that the president of Mexico. Limited in any matter, Mrs. Miramon alone could not attend public places because it was not well seen.Serchovich, S. La suerte de la consorte...p. 107 With the arrival of Maximilian of Habsburg to Mexico, the Miramon Lombardo family went to Berlin. In 1866, when Emperor Napoleon III left the Mexican emperor, Miramon returned to the country to fight for the Second Mexican Empire, which was a lost cause and would end with the imprisonment and execution of Maximilian, Miguel Miramon and Tomas Mejia. From left to right, execution of the generals Miguel Miramon and Tomas Mejia. On the far right is the Emperor Maximilian, who gave the center, place of honor at Miramon. She was faithful to the memory of her husband for the rest of his days. He went to Europe, where, according to the advice of the shot Emperor requested the support of the courts of Austria and Belgium. Only Belgian aid received. He lived in Rome and died on March 18, 1921 in Toulouse, France at 85 years old.  Memories  With simple style, this intelligent woman gave to the history of Mexico a gem; entitled Memoirs, he began writing at age 80. Along with the set of memories and experiences of his life, laden with a deep knowledge of the circumstances of his time, exposed under the conservative perspective that left her father and her husband, the volume of its publication has a little over a thousand pages. The Memoirs of Concepci√≥n Lombardo Miramon were published 63 after his death, thanks to the generosity of Francisco Cortina Portilla who, as explained in its preliminary Felipe Teixidor the acquired granddaughter Miramon based in the city of Palermo, where, elderly and sick, then he kept giving Spanish classes. While our distinguished friend soothed hardships, forever he rescued the testimony of one of the most tragic episodes in the history of Mexico.Lombardo de Miram√≥n, C. Memorias p.  Early years  Of Irish ancestry paternally, as Lombardo were a noble family foreigner who had settled in Spain around 1640 and moved to New Spain in the late eighteenth century, and related by matrilineal with the Spanish home of the Marquis of San Felipe; Maria de la Concepcion Josefa Ramona Ignacia Severa Lombardo Gil de Partearroyo, as was to be baptized by Mr. Jos√© Maria de Jesus Belaunzar√°n, Bishop of Linares.La Sra. Mons Belaunzar√°n baptized Concepci√≥n Lombardo He was born in Mexico City on Sunday, November 8, 1835 in a family of ancestry and wealth. It was the sixth of twelve children - six men and six women - who were born of the marriage, joined the April 17, 1824 in the capital, formed by the remarkable and renowned lawyer Francisco Maria Lombardo de la Pe√±a and (August 15, 1799 - April 11, 1855) and his wife, Maria Germana Gil de Partearroyo Mi√±√≥n (c 1811 -. April 6, 1853). Lombardo de la Pe√±a was a prominent lawyer, signer of the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire, constituent, 1823, signer of the Federal Constitution of the United Mexican States 1824, who held various positions, including that was several times Secretary of the Treasury and Chancellor in the governments of Santa Anna, Anastasio Bustamante and Valentin Gomez Farias. His wife, Maria Germana, was a beautiful woman capital, as befitted upper-class women of her time, only received religious education in a convent and was dedicated to housework.  Academic training  As they were many children, the duties of society besides his mother were numerous, Concha could never have been educated at home. He studied at a convent school run by the Pe√±arrojas ladies. By cross, his parents believed the rigor employed at that school could correct it. There he received a strict upbringing that included flogging, donkey ears and a cat thrown by his bigoted head teacher, who in his own words \\"was a devil incarnate.\\" The instruction was reduced to reading and catechism that forced her to learn by heart; and when the lesson was not known to the repeated cries word for word. His teachers were so ignorant they could not read or write, not even discern between San Jose and Jesus Christ. All they did well were the work of sewing and embroidery, and Concha had to learn to perfection with tears and punishments. During the training phase, which was to include teacher who was First Lady of Mexico, wife of General Melchor Muzquiz, Joaquina Bezares. During his student days annually her mother sent her to spend a month outside the capital, a family owned farm in a village called Tizap√°n.  Bibliography  * Lombardo de Miram√≥n, Concepci√≥n.

Prior to this fight, Fleeman had a record of 51 fights with 45 wins including 20 knockouts. Clay won the bout through a technical knockout after the referee stopped the fight in the seventh round. This was the first time Clay had gone over six rounds in a boxing match. It was also the first time Fleeman had ever been knocked down in a boxing match. Fleeman retired from boxing after this fight. Background Before this fight, Fleeman had fought with Ezzard Charles and Sonny Liston in boxing matches, winning against Charles, and losing to Liston. Of his encounter with Liston, Fleeman later recalled that he had gone backstage waiting for his fight when he noticed a huge man sitting next to him. Prior to the Clay‚ÄìFleeman bout, it was held that Fleeman's experience and durability gave him an edge over Clay. Buildup Fleeman had injured himself in his previous boxing match. Nevertheless, the guaranteed prize money for the Clay‚ÄìFleeman fight was an offer he could not refuse, particularly after his wife encouraged him to go on with the fight since they needed the money. Fleeman later explained: In interviews with the local newspapers Clay stated that \\"I plan to be heavyweight champion someday. If I can't beat this fellow, I ought to change my plans.\\" As was his usual practice before almost every Clay/Ali fight, Angelo Dundee announced that Clay would face his toughest test in the upcoming fight. The fight Although Fleeman was extremely durable and tough, Clay's speed overwhelmed the Texan in the fight. Fleeman was able to absorb Clay's punches during the bout, and would have probably gone the full distance, but for the fact that he was badly cut around both his eyes, and his nose had started bleeding, due to which the referee stopped the fight in the seventh round. Reflecting on the fight, Fleeman observed that Clay's arms were long and fast, and that he had felt as if he was a punching bag. Fleeman would also note that, despite the injury he had carried into the fight, Aftermath After the fight, Clay struck a Tarzan of the Apes pose in the dressing room and, with clenched fists and glaring eyes, intoned, \\"He had to go.\\" Clay then noticed a reporter he had met in Rome in 1960 who had witnessed Clay's bout with Zbigniew Pietrzykowski for the Olympic Light Heavyweight Championship. Clay told the reporter: \\"Hey, write about me. You ain't wrote about me since Rome.\\" Angelo Dundee brought some literary figures to interact with Clay after the boxer had taken a shower. Dundee later recalled what happened next: Long after Fleeman's retirement from boxing, the writer Jon McConal tracked him down and visited him at his home in Ellis County. McConal noted that at this time Fleeman was \\"still lean and looked like a fighter despite being in his late sixties.\\" However, at the time he died aged 80, Fleeman was suffering from Alzheimer's disease, and also from what Clay/Ali developed in latter years, Parkinson's disease.

The author of 1998's Feminist Thought: A More Comprehensive Introduction, an overview of the major traditions of feminist theory, she is the emeritus distinguished professor of health care ethics in the Department of Philosophy at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte. Tong's research is focused on ethical issues in long-term care, cognitive enhancement and genetics. She has been recognized for contributions to bioethics, health care reform, genetic and reproductive technology, and the implications of caregiving for parents and children, a role performed primarily by women.  Early Life  Tong was born Rosemarie Behensky in Chicago to Joseph J Behensky (1924-2005) and Lillian Ann Nedved (1924-1981), both of Czech ancestry. Her paternal grandfather was an immigrant from Nehodiv. Education Tong holds a BA in religious studies and German from Marygrove College, an MA in philosophy from Catholic University and a PhD from Temple University. Her MA thesis was on the 19th-century German philosopher Wilhelm Dilthey. She earned her PhD with a dissertation titled ‚ÄúTowards a Rational reconstruction of Anglo-American Criminal Law: The Insanity Defense.‚Äù Career and affiliations Tong has held professorships at Williams College and Lafayette College. She was the Thatcher Professor in Medical Humanities at Davidson College until 1999, when she began her professorship at the University of North Carolina. She chaired the American Philosophical Association‚Äôs Committee on the Status of Women from 2003-2007. From 1999-2002 she was the co-coordinator of the International Network for Feminist Approaches to Bioethics. Tong has also served as chair of the Institutional Review Board‚Äôs Conflict of Interest Committee at Chesapeake Research, Inc., co-chair of the North Carolina Institute of Medicine‚Äôs Task Force on Pandemic Influenza, and on the boards of the U.S. Women‚Äôs Bioethics Project, the North Carolina Biotechnology Center and the Association for Practical and Professional Ethics. Tong has been a consultant to the Advanced Center for Learning Studies, the Fulbright Foundation, the Hastings Center, the National Advisory Board on Ethics and Reproduction, and curricular programs involving medical humanities bioethics and women's studies. She has received grants from the Sloan Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Fullerton Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities. She has written 13 books and more than 100 papers, and was the series editor of the Point/Counterpoint series and the New Feminist Perspectives series from Rowman and Littlefield Press. In Feminist Thought, Tong describes intersectionality and its importance to the globalization of feminism. Tong explains the different sections of feminism that have emerged throughout the years. Tong suggests that intersectionality represents the commitment of women and global feminists, regardless of culture, to \\"widen the scope of feminist thought.\\" Although global feminism is defined by the sexual issues and gender discrimination of women, its personal twist stems from the political and economic disparities. \\"Third World\\" women are far more concerned with the latter disparities separating them from their privileged oppressors. The political agenda of the western world has direct implications on the globalization of the rest of the world, the \\"non-west.\\"  Personal life  Her first husband, Dr. Paul Ki King Tong, was a Chinese immigrant and professor at Glassboro State College. The couple bore 2 sons. After Paul died in 1988, she married Jeremiah Putnam. Her son Paul died in 2013.

Secure software is the result of security aware software development processes where security is built in and thus software is developed with security in mind.Securing Enterprise Web Applications at the Source: An Application Security Perspective, OWASP Security is most effective if planned and managed throughout every stage of software development life cycle (SDLC), especially in critical applications or those that process sensitive information. The solution to software development security is more than just the technology.  Software development challenges  As technology advances, application environments become more complex and application development security becomes more challenging. Applications, systems, and networks are constantly under various security attacks such as malicious code or denial of service. Some of the challenges from the application development security point of view include Viruses, Trojan horses, Logic bombs, Worms, Agents, and Applets. Applications can contain security vulnerabilities that may be introduced by software engineers either intentionally or carelessly. Software, environmental, and hardware controls are required although they cannot prevent problems created from poor programming practice. Using limit and sequence checks to validate users‚Äô input will improve the quality of data. Even though programmers may follow best practices, an application can still fail due to unpredictable conditions and therefore should handle unexpected failures successfully by first logging all the information it can capture in preparation for auditing. As security increases, so does the relative cost and administrative overhead. Applications are typically developed using high-level programming languages which in themselves can have security implications. The core activities essential to the software development process to produce secure applications and systems include: conceptual definition, functional requirements, control specification, design review, code review and walk- through, system test review, and maintenance and change management. Building secure software is not only the responsibility of a software engineer but also the responsibility of the stakeholders which include: management, project managers, business analysts, quality assurance managers, technical architects, security specialists, application owners, and developers.  Basic principles  There are a number of basic guiding principles to software security. Stakeholders‚Äô knowledge of these and how they may be implemented in software is vital to software security. These include: * Protection from disclosure * Protection from alteration * Protection from destruction * Who is making the request * What rights and privileges does the requester have * Ability to build historical evidence * Management of configuration, sessions and errors/exceptions  Basic practices  The following lists some of the recommended web security practices that are more specific for software developers. * Sanitize inputs at the client side and server side * Encode request/response * Use HTTPS for domain entries * Use only current encryption and hashing algorithms * Do not allow for directory listing * Do not store sensitive data inside cookies * Check the randomness of the session * Set secure and HttpOnly flags in cookies * Use TLS not SSL * Set strong password policy * Do not store sensitive information in a form‚Äôs hidden fields * Verify file upload functionality * Set secure response headers * Make sure third party libraries are secured * Hide web server information  Security testing  Common attributes of security testing include authentication, authorization, confidentiality, availability, integrity, non-repudiation, and resilience. Security testing is essential to ensure that the system prevents unauthorized users to access its resources and data. Some application data is sent over the internet which travels through a series of servers and network devices. This gives ample opportunities to unscrupulous hackers.  Summary  All secure systems implement security controls within the software, hardware, systems, and networks - each component or process has a layer of isolation to protect an organization's most valuable resource which is its data. There are various security controls that can be incorporated into an application's development process to ensure security and prevent unauthorized access.  References  * Stewart, James (2012).

Provisions  The four titles of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act are: Title I: Legislative Accountability and Reform. Any bill passed by committee must be submitted to the director of the Congressional Budget Office so that any federal mandates may be identified. No bill which contains any such mandate imposing a direct cost of more than fifty million dollars on a state, local or tribal government or a cost of more than one hundred million dollars on the private sector may be sent to the full chamber without a corresponding appropriation. Title II: Regulatory Accountability and Reform. Federal agencies must assess the cost of all new regulations to state, local and tribal governments and the private sector before issuing them. Where such costs exceed one hundred million dollars, the issuing agency must consult with the affected governments and make sure that no less burdensome alternative exists. Title III: Review of Federal Mandates. The U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations was directed to review the role of mandates in relations between the federal government and state, local and tribal governments and to recommend to Congress and to the president opportunities to simplify or eliminate federal mandates.

In 2020, Reporters Without Borders ranked Laos 172 out of 179 on its annual Press Freedom Index, behind countries such as Cuba and Iran. The Laotian government exerts almost total control over the press. Nearly all media organizations in Laos are government-owned and some Laotian journalists are party members attached to the government.  Regulations  According to Article 44 of the Laos‚Äô 2003 constitution, Lao citizens are guaranteed \\"the right and freedom of speech\\". However Article 23 of the constitution makes it clear that the state has ultimate authority over the press since it \\"attends to improving and expanding mass media activities for the purpose of national protection and development.\\" It also says that \\"‚Ä¶mass media activities which are detrimental to national interests or the fine traditional culture and dignity of [the] Lao people are prohibited.\\" In addition, Article 65 of the 2005 Penal Law of Laos, says that any person circulating information or images \\"detrimental to the Lao People's Democratic Republic or are for the purpose of undermining or weakening State authority\\" may be fined and imprisoned for up to five years. In July 2008, the Lao National Assembly approved a new press law, which included an article stating that media representatives have the right of access to government information. In practice, government officials often reply \\"no comment\\" when pressed for information or use delaying tactics, such as requiring reporters to submit official letters from their publication when seeking even routine statistics or comment. Laos has one of the lowest levels of internet penetration in the world, with just 14 percent of the population using the internet. In 2014, the Lao government adopted an Internet law that it claimed would support the growth of the Internet. However the law included a number of restrictions on social media and other internet communications. It required website operators to verify information \\"before disseminating it on their web page\\" and says that information that has not been approved by the state or state media \\"cannot be used officially.\\" It also extends restrictions on traditional media to the internet, and bans supporting online campaigns \\"that seek to divide solidarity among ethnic groups and countries,\\" spreading information that might lead to social disorder and tarnishing the \\"dignity and rights of individuals, sectors, institutions or organizations.\\" The law also requires users to register for social media accounts using their real names, and bans the use of pseudonyms. In addition, a presidential decree issued in November 2015 ordered foreign journalists in Laos to submit their reporting to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before publication or broadcast  News Agency and Newspapers  The official news agency, Khaosan Pathet Lao (KPL), supplies information to other media outlets under government regulations. There are about 24 regularly printed newspapers in Laos, and all are government affiliated. Newspapers in Laos are described by the Southeast Asian Press Alliance as a \\"mouthpiece\\" rather than watchdog of the state. Laotian newspapers such as the national newspaper Pasason (\\"The People\\") and the daily Vientiane Mai (\\"Vientiane Message\\") are under strict control of Ministry of Information and Culture. Two foreign language papers, the English-language daily Vientiane Times and the French-language weekly Le R√©novateur are both published by Lao Press in Foreign Languages, a specialized agency of the Ministry of Information and Culture. One of the Vientiane Times‚Äô founders was former director general and editor-in-chief of this agency. The newspaper says on its website that it reflects government policy. Discussion of controversial topics is handled carefully. For example, during the controversial repatriation of ethnic Hmong people to Laos from Thailand in 2009, government media did not report on allegations that the refugees were short of food and basic necessities. Instead, the English language Vientiane Times praised their living conditions and described them as living in government operated \\"development villages.\\" Several privately owned periodicals that cover business, society and non-political issues are allowed to publish without the government approving their content in advance. However they may face penalties after publication if the government disapproves of their content.  Broadcasting  There are 32 television stations and 44 radio stations in Laos, all state-owned. Two Lao government-run television stations broadcast local news without English programs. Lao National Television (LNT) is the state television station. However, with the establishment of cable TV service in Laos under cooperation with a Chinese company, subscribers now have access to up to 30 foreign television channels including BBC, CNN, and channels from countries including China and Thailand. Given the fact that newspapers and TV stations are often not available in the countryside, Lao National Radio (LNR), the national radio station, is the most important media outlet for people roughly 70 percent of the country. It broadcasts international news from sources like CNN and China's Xinhua News Agency. However its content is closely supervised by the government. In a 2013 UNESCO report, a senior executive of LNR told the agency that its editors have weekly meetings with the Ministry of Information. During the meetings, they receive responses to critical reporting or news that has a \\"negative impact on policies and the State. Journalists who are critical of the government will be either warned or restricted in their coverage.\\"  Internet  The Lao National Internet Committee under the office of the Prime Minister administers the internet system. Under government control, critical content of government and policies can be blocked. All internet service providers must submit quarterly reports and provide article links to the government to facilitate monitoring. People and internet service providers who violate controls will be punished, and online criticism of the government and the Communist Party is prohibited. The government does not block major foreign news sources and it is unable to control blogging or the establishment of new websites.  International Media in Laos  Though international news from foreign news sources have limited exposure in Laos, foreign publications are difficult to find outside its capital, Vientiane. Newsweek, The Economist, Time and the Bangkok Post are available in Vientiane minimarkets. In 2011, the Vietnamese Nh√¢n D√¢n (The People) and the Chinese Xinhua News Agency were allowed to open bureaus in Vientiane.  Journalists Safety in Laos  The indicative relationship between media and government protects journalists to some extent, since media needs approval before publication and their news sources are mostly government. Now there are three known journalists imprisoned in Laos due to violations of the media law.

It combines Neo- Baroque and Art Nouveau influences. The property comprises about 1200 square meters, including ten main rooms, rooms for servants and a big hall, and originally had around 7 decare park and 80 metres shoreline. In the 1970s five new villas were built on parts of the park which were partitioned off.

The building was constructed for the religious Christian organization Indre Mission in 1910 to house a teachers' seminary for women. The building has housed educational institutions since it was built although Indre Mission no longer owns the building. The name of the school has changed over the years as it has transitioned through different operators but VIA University College may be the last as the college will eventually relocate to CeresByen. The building was designed by the architect Frits Jensen who gave it a French palace-expression.  Background  In the early 1900s there was a construction boom in the neighborhood of Tr√∏jborg and the religious organization Indre Mission joined in when it was decided to construct a seminary in Aarhus. Similar to the construction of St. John's Church in 1905 it was to be funded by private means. Indre Mission started collecting contributions from their members to establish the seminary along with homes for about 3 students. In 1909 it was decided the economic conditions were favorable enough to start construction. Ground had not yet been broken when Indre Mission rented rooms in a villa and started teaching two classes while the teacher and rector lived on the first floor. The seminary was placed next to the Finsensgade School so teacher students could use the elementary school to practice and learn. The seminary was completed in 1910 and was inaugurated on 30 November.  Seminary  The student body was generally diverse but the teachers and rectors were selected and approved by Indre Mission. The initial school in 1910 was known as the Aarhus Female Seminary but in 1931 it became co-ed and was renamed to the Aarhus Seminary (Danish: Aarhus Seminarium). In 1989 Aarhus Seminary merged with Marselisborg Seminary and was renamed to Aarhus Common-Seminary (Danish: √Örhus F√¶llesseminarium) and in 1995 the school was renamed again to Aarhus Day- and Evening Seminary (Danish: √Örhus Dag- og Aftenseminarium). In 2008 VIA University College was created and took over the school, renaming it VIA L√¶reruddannelsen. In 2016, the school left the building and moved to the new CeresByen neighborhood. Over time some 5000 people have graduated as teachers from the school.  Architecture  The building was designed by architect Frits Jensen. The period is notable for an architectural style which emulated French palace architecture with light, plastered facades, often with bay windows and a facade divided with pilasters and lesenes and decorated with festons, floral vines or reefs. The Aarhus Female Seminary is an imposing example of trend and one of only a few in the neighborhood. In 1932 it had become necessary to expand the school since new laws had made higher-education gendered schools illegal. The new building was situated next to the original building and was designed with a rational Functionalist expression.

He was a member of the North End Caucus and prominent member of the Sons of Liberty, which formed to protest the passage of the Stamp Act of 1765. The efforts of the Sons of Liberty created the foundation for the Boston Tea Party. Kent called for independence early in the American Revolution.  Career  Kent graduated Harvard College in the class of 1727. In 1731, he served as chaplain at Fort George, Maine, and preached to the settlers at Brunswick. He was ordained as minister of the Marlborough Congregational church in 1733, where charges of heresy were soon leveled against him \\"due to his public questioning of the doctrines of the Trinity, of Absolute Election, and of Infant Damnation.\\" Following his dismissal, Kent successfully sued the Town of Marlborough for the balance of his fees and salary due. Kent then studied for the bar and began practicing in Boston in 1739, when there were only seven lawyers in the city, among whom he was at first \\"the Chimney sweeper of the Bar, into whose black dock entered every dirty action.\\". He lived on the north side of King's Street (present-day State Street, Boston) by the north end of the First Town-House, Boston.p. 47 He handled divorces, and represented numerous slaves in their attempts to gain their freedom, including the case of a slave Pompey suing his master Benjamin Faneuil. Kent was the first lawyer in the United States to win a case to free a slave Jenny Slew, in 1766. He also won a trial in the Old County Courthouse for a slave named Watson (1771). Kent also handled Lucy Pernam's divorce and the freedom suits of Rose and Salem Orne. On 1 April 1776, Kent became Attorney General of Massachusetts.p. 44 Kent was occasionally a guest at the Old Colony Club, whose members included John Adams. Kent has been described as one of Adams's \\"role-models in the elite of the Boston bar.\\" = American Revolution = Kent was a senior member of the Sons of Liberty in Boston and maintained correspondence with John Wilkes.https://archive.org/details/principlesactsof01nile/page/322?q=%22benjamin+kent%22 On the eve of the American Revolution he was reported to be a member of more town committees than any other Bostonian. After the Siege of Boston, Kent urged Adams to create the Declaration of Independence: :\\"\\"Kent to Adams, 24 April 1776 In response, Adams assured Kent that the \\"'Declarations in Words' of What is every day manifested in Deeds of the most determined Nature\\" was forthcoming. On August 4, 1776, Kent wrote Samuel Adams, \\"It is GOD's doing the bringing about his truly astonishing and unparalled'd union the declaration of Independence.\\" The loyalist Sampson Salter Blowers married Kent's daughter Elizabeth. When the Revolutionary War began, as Attorney General, Kent was forced to briefly to hold his son-in-law Blowers in jail for being a loyalist. In 1782, Kent's daughter Elizabeth fell ill in New York and he petitioned to have her return to Boston. The petition was refused and she departed for Nova Scotia.https://archive.org/details/genealogiesdiff00briggoog/page/n67?q=%22Benjamin+Kent%22 Governor Thomas Cushing sent Kent to Halifax to retrieve the probate records for Suffolk County, Massachusetts after the Revolution in 1784. The records had been taken by the son of Edward Winslow (scholar) and given to the loyalist judge Foster Hutchinson, who had left Boston on the eve of the Revolution (1776). Nova Scotia Governor John Parr facilitated the negotiations with Foster, which led to Cushing returning to Massachuetts with the legal documents. Personal life Kent was the son of Joseph Kent of Charlestown, and was baptised in June 1708 at First Parish in Cambridge. In 1740 he married Elizabeth Watts in Chelsea, Massachusetts, with whom he had three daughters, Elizabeth, Ann, and Sally. His daughter Sally married Sampson Salter Blowers. When Blowers, a loyalist, departed for Halifax after the Revolution, joined by Kent's wife and daughters. Kent, at age 78, rejoined them in 1785. He died there three years later and is buried in the Old Burying Ground.  Legacy  John Adams included Kent in the \\"long catalogue of illustrious men, who were agents in the Revolution.\\" Benjamin Franklin wrote, upon hearing of Kent's death: \\"Our poor friend Ben Kent is gone; I hope to the Regions of the Blessed, or at least to some Place where Souls are prepared for those Regions. . . . I found my Hope on this, that tho' not so orthodox as you and I, he was an honest Man, and had his Virtues.

The competition began on 8 April and concluded with the Grand Final on 24 September 2017. The Grand Final was won by Port Melbourne, who defeated by 4 points at Etihad Stadium. League membership At the end of the 2016 season, AFL Victoria terminated the licence of the Frankston Football Club due to its financial position, which was no longer considered viable. The club had suffered a severe downturn in the profitability of its pokies licence over the previous few years, and by 2016 the machines were generating a loss for the club. The club terminated the pokies licence in May 2016, but by that time owed more than $1,500,000, both to the state gaming regulators and other creditors. The club went into voluntary administration in August, and the club's VFL licence was terminated the following month, in the week after the VFL Grand Final. The club's immediate existence was saved when creditors, including the gaming regulators, agreed to waive more than 90% of the club's debt, and it came out of administration in late November 2016, but was still excluded from the 2017 season. The club then embarked on a campaign to assure its long-term viability, which included signing up 1200 members and working to improve its relationship with the local leagues as a pathway for Mornington Peninsula footballers into state football. The club applied for and was re- granted its VFL licence for the 2018 season, meaning it missed only one season of football. There had been an expectation over the previous few years that the Australian Football League's St Kilda Football Club would terminate its reserves affiliation with Sandringham at the end of 2016 and enter a stand- alone reserves team into the VFL. However, after renegotiations during 2016, a new rolling affiliation deal with no fixed term was signed the two clubs to begin in 2017. The new deal changed the nature of the affiliation, expanding St Kilda's involvement in Sandringham's operation: this included removing a stipulation from the previous agreement that no more than 14 St Kilda listed players could play in Sandringham's senior team in any given match. The deal will also result in the club playing three games per year in St Kilda colours from the 2018 season at St Kilda's former home ground Moorabbin Oval. The Casey Scorpions were renamed the Casey Demons, to co-brand the club with its AFL-affiliate, . The club changed its guernsey design to match that of the Melbourne Football Club. In the second season of the VFL Women's competition, the licence held by the North Geelong Football Club to operate the Geelong Magpies team was transferred to the AFL's Geelong Football Club, who rebranded the team as the Cats; the Knox Falcons left the competition; and, the Box Hill Football Club was granted a licence to enter the competition. The size of the VFL Women's thus remained at ten clubs.

Including its premierships in the former Victorian Women's Football League Premier Division, it was Darebin's fifth consecutive premiership. Notable events *Werribee's home ground, Avalon Airport Oval, was unavailable throughout the 2017 season as it was being upgraded. Rather than setting up a permanent alternative, the club played all nine of its home games at different venues, in Torquay, North Melbourne, Wangaratta, Carlton, Docklands, Frankston, Craigieburn, Hoppers Crossing and Footscray. *After a successful two-year contract, a new two-year broadcast deal covering the 2017 and 2018 seasons was signed between the VFL and Seven Network. *Eventual premiers Port Melbourne fell on financial hardships prior to the 2017 season, and the entire playing and coaching list forwent match payments in the club's Round 1 match. *North Ballarat's home ground, Eureka Stadium, underwent a change in management at the start of the season when the entire precinct was compulsorily acquired by the City of Ballarat. The arena and part of the outer was already crown land, with the rest being owned on freehold title by the football club; but the council acquired the entire precinct as it needed to be upgraded for an Australian Football League game in August ‚Äì the first ever to be staged at the venue ‚Äì and the council did not have faith that the North Ballarat Football Club board, which had recently undergone a significant and unstable period of change, would be able to manage the works. The club received $5.5M in compensation for the acquisition and an interim lease to use the ground in the 2017 VFL season. These issues formed part of the off-field instability which saw the club's VFL licence terminated at the end of the season. *Ron Todd, the prolific key forward who played for in the VFL in the 1930s and Williamstown in the VFA in the 1940s, was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame. He was only the second player who played the majority of his career in the VFA post-1897 to be inducted.

It is located on the N1 (Meiganga-Ngaound√©r√©) road, between the villages of Garga and Manbaka, about an hour and forty minutes' drive from Ngaound√©r√©.  Geography and climate  The village is located on a flat plain at an altitude of 1129 metres above sea level. The soil is mostly orange in colour, with black areas and very few rocks. The vegetation is a mixture of savannah, thickets and a denser forest The climate is temperate. The first rains occur in mid-April and they end in mid-September.  History  The village of Babongo developed from an intersection which linked Belel to Meiganga by an unpathed road without passing through Ngaound√©r√©. It has expanded as a result of the proximity of high tension power pylons and posts for a fibre optic cable, which have enabled the village to be electrified and encouraged the formerly nomadic population to adopt sedentarism.  Administration and politics  Babongo is administered by a traditional chief of the second degree. The CPDM, NUDP, and other political parties are active in the village.  Demographics  The population of Babongo exceeded 350 inhabitants in 2015, settled in an area of more than 2 km.2 There is a primary school with four classrooms in three levels (Sil-CP; CE1-CE2; CM1-CM2). Further education has to be undertaken at the village of Garga, which has a secondary school. There is also a district office for health, well-digging, and drinking water. The inhabitants of Babongo are Muslim and Christian. The mosque is located next to the chief's house and there is a small chapel for the Christians. The main ethnic groups in the village are Fulani, Mb√©r√©, Mbum, and Gbaya. They practice both agriculture and pastoralism.  Economy and transport  The local economy is based on the sale of livestock, agriculture and the informal economy. Transport is mostly by motorcycle, private car, or hitchhiking with cars travelling along the Meiganga-Ngaound√©r√© road.

His two most famous poems are perhaps The Sea Queen Wakes (1896) and Coronation Hymn composed in honour of the coronation of George V. Early life Edward Clive Oldnall Long Phillipps was born in 1853 as the eldest son of a public schoolmaster Richard Augustus Long Phillipps, who was distantly related to Lord Robert Clive. He was educated at Rossall School. In 1877, as a legally entitled but distantly related male inheritor, he successfully petitioned to inherit his great-grandfather's Wolley estate with land covering about two hundred acres. He added the Wolley family name to his own and dropped \\"Edward\\" from his legal name. Career At age 20, Phillipps was appointed, to the vice-consulship of the British Legation in Kerch, Crimea. He explored and hunted big game in the Caucasus. He studied law, was called to the bar at Middle Temple but practised law for less than a year. After inheriting the Wolley estate, Phillips-Wolley resigned from the British consular service and joined the fourth battalion of the South Wales Borderers, taught marksmanship, and attained the rank of captain. He was an active cricketer, playing during 1885-86 at county level for Shropshire while at club level for Shrewsbury, scoring in 6 matches 14 runs while taking 22 wickets.Published under Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians. In 1882, he went on a two-month hunting trip in British Columbia and in the autumn of 1887 he went, accompanied by his wife, on another visit to Canada and they stayed for a considerable time in Victoria, British Columbia. In the early 1890s, Clive and Jane Phillipps-Wolley, with their three daughters and son, settled in Oak Bay, British Columbia. He edited for Longman, Green & Company's Badminton Library the 2-volume collection Big Game Shooting (1894) and contributed 2 essays to the first volume and 4 essays to the second volume; a second edition of the 2 volumes was published in 1895. In 1896, Phillipps-Wolley was appointed to enforce the Health Act in the mining districts of British Columbia. In the early 1900s, the family moved into an estate occupying all of Piers Island, sold in 1909. In 1912, the family moved to \\"The Grange\\", a mansion located near Duncan, British Columbia and designed according to their requirements by the architect Samuel Maclure. In 1908, Phillipps-Wolley began to warn of the dangers posed by an expanding German navy and in 1910 joined the Navy League of Canada. For his patriotic verse in support of the British empire and his work for the Navy League, he was knighted in 1914, the only British Columbian writer to be knighted. Personal life In 1879, married Jane Fenwick, the second daughter of Rear-Admiral William Henry Fenwick (1827‚Äì1906). When in Oak Bay, British Columbia, he commissioned architect William Ridgway Wilson (1863‚Äì1957) to design and build a mansion for them (The Oak Bay street where they lived was later renamed Clive Drive). They were the parents of three daughters and one son. His only son, Lieutenant-Commander Clive Phillipps-Wolley, died, along with 47 other crew members, on 22 September 1914 in the sinking of HMS Hogue by the German U-boat U-9.

Stevens (Collins & Stevens, 1981). Allan Collins was a chief scientist at Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc., a research firm in Cambridge Massachusetts. He is also a specialist in the field of cognitive science and human semantic processing. Albert L. Stevens was a senior scientist at Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. He was also director of the company's Artificial Intelligence, Education Technology and Training Systems Division. He is also a specialist in cognitive science. (Reigeluth, 1983) The Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching according to Collins and Stevens (1981) requires the learner to construct theories and principles through dialogue, the teaching of self-questioning techniques and the teaching of metacognitive or self-monitoring skills, all with the intent of clarifying misconceptions so the theory or principle is well articulated and developed. The essence of the cognitive theory of Inquiry teaching is that of developing students' metacognitive skills. Inquiry teaching deliberately attempts to develop these stills through instruction. The theory is a prescriptive model rooted in the discovery tradition and cognitive sciences. It was derived form an analysis of the transcripts of teachers, described as interactive teachers, using a variety of teaching strategies. These strategies were in some way related to one of the following methodology: the inquiry method of the teaching, discovery method of teaching and Socratic method of teaching. The transcripts studied represent a variety of topics taught by teachers across different subject areas (Reigeluth, 1983). Collins and Stevens believed that their Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching is domain independent or that it can be applied across subject areas or the curriculum.  Historical background  Inquiry teaching is rooted in the didactic methodologies of the ancient Greek. According Mayer and Alexander (2011), inquiry teaching is rooted in the didactic methodology of the ancient Greek, where the teacher poses a problem and assists the student in solving that problem by asking a series of question. They have also pointed out that this method of instruction can be seen in the works of Plato and Socrates. Bransford, Franks and Sherwood (1989), as cited by Mayer and Alexander (2011), have indicated that it was not until the 1960s that the role of teachers started to change from where the teacher provided the student with the questions as well as the answers. After the 1960s, instruction provided greater opportunity for students to engage in creating their own answers to questions posed (Mayer & Alexander, 2011).  Characteristics  The purpose of the Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching according to Collins (1986) is to provide learners with the opportunity to ‚Äúactively engage in articulating theories and principles that are critical to deep understanding of a domain‚Äù (p.1). Collins (1986) believes that the knowledge attained will allow the learner to actively and meaningfully engage in solving problems and making predictions. He also indicated that the knowledge acquire is not simply content knowledge. Figure 1 summarizes Collins and Stevens Theory of Inquiry Teaching. The Cognitive Theory of Inquiry (Interactive) Teaching according to the Reigeluth (1983) consists of three parts: # The teachers goals # The teaching strategies employed by teachers # The controlling structures used to govern their teaching. There are two main goals teachers using the inquiry method seek to achieve, according to Collin and Stevens (1981): # The teaching of a particular rule or theory # Teaching students how to derive the rule or theory. These two main goals are associated with several sub-goals. The list below identifies the two main goals and their associated sub-goal as posited by Collins and Stevens (1981): #The teaching of a particular rule or theory #* Analyzing and addressing misconceptions of students hypotheses #* Students are taught how to make prediction in new situations #Teaching students how to derive the rule or theory #* Students are taught what questions to ask #* Students are taught the nature of the theory or rule #* Students are taught how to test the rule or theory #* Student are taught how to articulate and defend the rule or theory  Teaching strategies employed by teachers  Collins and Stevens (1981) have highlighted ten teaching strategies used by teachers using inquiry teaching. They believed that these ten teaching strategies, listed below, are the most important ones identified in their investigation. These ten teaching strategies identified by Collin and Stevens (1981, p. 18) are: #Selecting positive and negative exemplars #Varying cases systematically #Selecting counterexamples #Generating hypothetical cases #Forming hypotheses #Testing hypotheses #Considering alternative predictions #Entrapping students #Tracing consequences to a contradiction #Questioning authority  Controlling structures used to govern their teaching  Colling and Stevens (1981) indicated that the time allocated between the teachers' goals and sub-goals is critical to the effectiveness of inquiry teaching. Collins and Stevens (1977), as cited by Collins and Stevens (1981) had made an attempt at developing a theory of controlling structures after getting feedback from several tutors. This controlling structure theory consisted of four parts. The four parts this theory includes the following: #\\"a set of strategies for selecting cases with respect to the main goals, #a student model, #an agenda, #a set of priority rules for adding goals and sub-goals to the agenda.\\" (p. 47) Collins and Stevens (1981) have suggested that base on the goals of the teacher, cases are selected to ensure that student develop mastery of the principles or theories being taught. They have also indicated that teachers appear to develop some strategies for selecting cases to develop students' mastery of the principles or theories. These are some of the strategies used by teachers for selecting cases as mentioned by Collins and Stevens (1981): #cases that demonstrated the more important factors were selected before those that have less important factors #the cases selected were sequenced from concrete factors to abstract factors #the selection of cases dependent on their importance and frequency: more important or frequent to less important and less frequent According to Collins and Stevens the controlling structure used to govern the dialogue in the Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching is demonstrated in the following manner: #A case is chosen, which is a theory or principle, based on the main goal of the teacher. The teacher then questions students to determine their understanding of the theory. Students' answers reveal their understanding or lack of understanding. Next, the teacher tags the theory or principle based what students know, their error and what they do not know. Collins and Stevens referred to this as the students' model. #Armed with the students' model, the teacher can then add information to facilitate and improve students understanding of what is known. This is determined by the level of sophistication of students' answers. #Sub- goals are developed to diagnose and address students' errors and misconceptions. #An agenda is developed prioritizing how students' errors and misconception well be address using the sub-goals developed. Collins and Stevens (1977), as cited in Collins and Stevens (1981), have identified how priorities have been set by teachers. Priorities have been set based on the following: #\\"Errors before omissions. #Prior steps before later steps. #Shorter fixes before longer fixes. #More important factors before less important factors\\" (p. 49) Criticism of the Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching Reigeluth (1983) has put forward the following criticisms about Cognitive Theory of Inquiry: #He believes that the theory is not suitable for all kinds of content as proposed by Collins and Stevens (1981), who believed that the theory is domain independent and that it can be used to facilitate the development of rules and theories needed for deep understand of the domain. The theory, as he indicated, is more applicable to instruction involving the construction or understanding of rules, principles and theories. The theory may not be suitable for the teaching of facts or concept. #He believes that the theory is not self-sufficient, in that it requires the use of other forms of instruction to facilitate the development students background information, which is critical to the discovery process proposed by Collins and Stevens (1981) #The theory may not be efficient in specific rules and principle, particularly those involving algorithms, where an expository approach may be more efficient.  Conclusion  The Collins and Stevens Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching, despite the short coming identified by Reigeluth (1983), provides some strategies for teaching high-order thinking skills. Reigeluth (1983) also points out that the Collins and Stevens Cognitive Theory of Teaching provides some strategies for instruction that other theories have overlooked. Strategies such as considering alternative prediction, entrapping students, tracing consequences to a contradiction and questioning authority are invaluable skill in critical thinking. The focus of education today is to develop learners who are independent critical thinkers. There was once the belief that critical thinking skills could not be taught and that these skills develop naturally independent of instruction. The Collins and Stevens Cognitive Theory of Inquiry of Teaching indicate that learners can be taught strategies to develop and apply critical thinking skills. Dewey (1938), as cited by McGregor (2007), pointed out that if students are provided with factual information without the cognitive skills that would enable them to understand, appreciate, transfer and connect ideas, the information gained would become meaningless in the future. It implies therefore, that instruction should seek to nurture the development of critical thinking skill. Dewey (1910) as cited by McGregor (2007), has also indicated that there is a connection between thinking and learning. He posited that \\"thoughts involved in developing ideas and understandings are often assumed and implicated. To develop thoughtful learning these processes need to be more explicit and connected to the processes of coming to know and understand\\" (p. 47).  Publications by Allan Collins and Albert L.

He ran for various Vermont political offices, always unsuccessfully, in every election cycle from 1970 until 2016. Early life Diamondstone was born in the New York borough of The Bronx in 1934 and raised in the borough of Queens. His father was a dentist and a socialist. In 1944, at the age of nine, Diamondstone got a job passing out flyers for the fourth presidential campaign of Franklin D. Roosevelt. He served in the U.S. Army from 1954 to 1956. Diamondstone received a J.D. degree from the University of Chicago Law School in 1960 and moved to Vermont in 1968, and soon began his involvement in politics there. Career Diamondstone, along with former U.S. Congressman William H. Meyer, Bernie Sanders (who is a current U.S. Senator), and others, founded the Liberty Union Party in 1970. From then until his death, he ran every two years for various political offices, never receiving more than 8% of the vote in general elections. Diamondstone arrived late to a debate for U.S. Congress in 1980, and was told he would not be able to participate. He remained in the debate area and was arrested. He was also arrested in 1996 while attempting to participate in a debate for U.S. Congress, for which he was a candidate. In 2006, Diamondstone was escorted off stage and charged with disorderly conduct after cursing at students in the audience and repeatedly speaking past his allotted time during a U.S. Senate debate. Once a friend and political ally of Bernie Sanders, the two gradually drifted apart as Sanders transitioned into mainstream electoral politics. In 1984, Diamondstone passed out anti-Sanders flyers, calling him a \\"Quisling\\" and criticizing him for endorsing Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale. He did not endorse Sanders' 2016 presidential candidacy and referred to him as a war criminal for supporting the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. Political positions Diamondstone was a supporter of Vermont seceding from the United States. He advocated for community ownership of the means of production as well as nationalization of the healthcare system and increasing the number of paid leave and paid vacation days. Diamondstone also believed in disbanding the Vermont National Guard and replacing it with a civilian militia. He opposed water fluoridation, genetically modified food, and the HPV vaccine, which he referred to as a \\"Big Pharma sham\\". Diamondstone was an advocate of eliminating the voting age. He also wanted to open hearings to investigate conspiracy theories relating to the September 11 attacks. Ideologically, he identified as a \\"nonviolent revolutionary socialist\\". Personal life Diamondstone and his wife, Doris Lake, whom he married in 1957, had four children: Aaron, Jessy, Ian, and Paula; as well as 14 grandchildren and 3 great grandchildren. He was an atheist. Diamondstone died on August 30, 2017, at age 82. According to his wife, he was suffering from several ailments, including heart and kidney diseases, and had been recently released from the hospital. Diamondstone also suffered from leg sores which required him to wear shorts to stay comfortable. Upon his death, Bernie Sanders said, \\"I first met Peter Diamondstone over 45 years ago. While I have not had any real contact with him for many, many years, I have the feeling that he never changed. Peter was a very independent thinker, unafraid to express his (often controversial) point of view on any subject. As a result, he forced people to examine and defend their own positions. No small thing. In his own way, Peter played an important role in Vermont politics for many decades.\\" Electoral history Scattering votes are not included. =1970s= Vermont Attorney General Democratic primary, 1970 * Thomas P.

Goode worked as an engineer for Broadspeed alongside his contemporary Andy Rouse, before he won the Forward Trust Saloon Car Championship in a self built Ford Anglia in 1974. He founded his own preparation company, Graham Goode Performance Centre in 1976, specialising in Ford vehicles.  BTCC career  After winning several championships in national motorsport, Goode moved up to the British Saloon Car Championship in 1984 driving his own company's Nissan Bluebird. Results came quickly, with several wins scored and a 3rd place in class in his first season. The following season saw another competitive showing. Taking advantage of his relationship with Ford, Goode was one of the first drivers to race the Ford Sierra RS500 in 1987, in fact taking the type's first ever victory. Goode continued his relationship with the RS500 in the following seasons, building his own cars independently to race in the series. He expanded and ran his team with Listerine sponsorship and took on Sean Walker and Mike Newman as drivers alongside himself. While the team's results were solid, Goode could not repeat his earlier good form. Ford were not investing in any one team and without sufficient funds, results were hard to come by. Following the switch from the class system to the super touring regulations in 1991, Goode ran the car for Andy Middlehurst, and despite having very little money, managed to have a competitive season. Goode left the BTCC and began racing in the far east, winning races in Malaysia.  Graham Goode Performance Centre  Today, Goode continues to run his car preparation business, based in Leicestershire. Employing 25 people, the company offers performance parts, tuning and restoration of Ford, Subaru and Mitsubishi vehicles.

The probability of using one of the bases equals 1/3. After receiving the string of qubits, Bob also randomly chooses one of three bases for measuring the state of each qubits.

The first one was broadcast weekly on WHN in New York City, New York, July 18, 1941 - November 3, 1942. The second was syndicated nationally October 25, 1945 - April 18, 1946. It was the first program distributed by WHN Transcription Service, which previously had distributed only commercials. Format =1941-1942 version= Richard Henry Benson was \\"a crime-fighter of super-strength known as the Avenger\\" who was accompanied by his sidekick, Fergus \\"Mac\\" MacMurdie. Benson was described as \\"one part Shadow and three parts Doc Savage, drawing elements from each in an attempt to recreate the commercial success of those two characters.\\" In August 1941, newsstands in WHN's listening area displayed \\"large red cardboard posters\\" that emphasized the connection between the radio program and Street and Smith's magazine, The Avenger. =1945-1946 version= Radio historian John Dunning described this season of The Avenger as \\"a poor man's version of The Shadow.\\" Jim Brandon (alter ego of The Avenger) was a biochemist who invented a Telepathic Indicator and a Secret Diffusion Capsule, both of which helped him fight crime.Terrace, Vincent (1999).

Jim Cox, in his book Radio Crime Fighters: More Than 300 Programs from the Golden Age, noted characteristics that The Avenger shared with The Shadow: 1) having \\"a drop- dead gorgeous subordinate, Fern Collier, who alone knew his true identity\\", 2) being hidden by \\"a black light of invisibility\\" and 3) having the ability to interpret \\"'thought flashes' of other people.\\" Cox added that the similarities could be explained by the facts that Walter B. Gibson was the creator of both characters and that both characters had appeared in magazines from Street & Smith Publications before their radio programs began. Personnel =1941-1942 version= Dunning's reference book, On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio, says that the main character, Richard Henry Benson, was played by an \\"unknown New York actor,\\" while Humphrey Davis portrayed Fergus \\"Mac\\" MacMurdie.

Kartz also fought in the Second World War, as a front gunner in No. IX Squadron. Biography In 1940, Kartz married Dorothy Cruse (1914‚Äì2012), and they were together for the next seventy-two years, until her death in 2012. The couple had two sons: John (born 1945) and Graham (born 1948). Kartz fought in the Second World War as part of the newly formed No. IX Squadron. In an interview with the Birmingham Mail, he said of his time with the RAF Bomber Command: \\"I feel very lucky to have had the life I had. Seventy years ago I was flying Wellington Bombers over Germany for the RAF during World War II and I got away with that, so I feel very lucky.‚Äù He also recalled of a near-miss with a Junkers Ju 88, after his pilot took a charge of direction: \\"We asked Flying Control for permission to land and they said 'OK, do you want the flarepath on?' 'Oh, yes please.' So they said 'Well, fire your colours of the day, and we'll put on'. He did that, and when he fired his colours of the day, a Junkers 88 was sat at the back of us! Fortunately, they switched off the flarepath and the Junkers took off and dropped a fire behind us. Fortunately, we had taken off...\\" Post- war, Kartz became a self made businessman, operating his own engineering companies. In 1919, Kartz attended his first Aston Villa match, and a lifelong love of the club was born. In the 1950s, he struck up a friendship with Doug Ellis. In 1968, Ellis appointed him as deputy chairman on the new Villa board, when the club was taken over by Pat Matthews. Prior to his involvement with the Villa board, he was a part of the Villa Shareholders Association. In 1978, when Ellis had a boardroom feud with Ron Bendall, Kartz sided with the latter, and Ellis was ousted. Afterwards, Bendall persuaded him to become chairman of the club. Kartz would go on to have a good working relationship with manager Ron Saunders, until a transfer dispute over Mick Ferguson and Peter Withe meant that he would resign as chairman, arguing that harmony between chairman and manager was vital. He was replaced by Bendall, and became vice-chairman for the next two seasons, in which Villa won the First Division title and the European Cup. He left the board in 1983. His legacy at Villa is supported by the youth scouting network set up with Tommy Docherty, that brought Brian Little and Gordon Cowans to the club, and helping the club purchase Bodymoor Heath, which still remains their training base. Kartz also had a great love of horse racing, entering horses in the Derby and Arc de Triomphe; it was a \\"big win\\" in 1950 that was the catalyst for founded his engineering business. In later life, Kartz twice appeared on ITV's 100 Year Old Drivers, firstly in August 2014, and then posthumously in September 2016. On 12 March 2016, Kartz died at the age of 102. He is survived by his sons, grandchildren and great- grandchildren.

Marriage to Amelia Hackney Between 1857 and 1864 Ah Sat Wong met Amelia Hackney (the daughter of prosperous and well-educated family from Manchester, England, involved in the drapery trade). It was usual for European women to trade with Chinese retailers, social customs frowned upon anything more. Regardless, the couple were: ‚Äò‚Ä¶ family legend states that when the couple married in Goulburn on 19 March 1864, they did so with Amelia's brothers in hot pursuit of the couple.‚Äô. Shortly after they settled in the gold mining town of Tuena (approximately 70 kilometres south west of Bathurst), where they conducted butchery and general business selling Chinese and European goods to the locals. While in Tuena, Amelia gave birth to five of their children. In 1875, the Wongs moved south to the predominantly Irish and Scottish migrant settlement - Fullerton/Bolong (near Crookwell, New South Wales), where Amelia gave birth to another four of their children. Wong Sat was naturalised in 1879, allowing him to purchase approximately 4,000 acres,According to Wong Ah Sat's probate records, the acreage he owned stretched over two properties: Bolong and The Bar. the Wongs used the property to raise sheep and establish a general store to supply the local community of farmers and graziers. Wong Family Store The Wong family store supplied an extraordinary range of goods from Australia and overseas, from preserved fruit picked from the family's orchard to violin strings imported from Germany. When Ah Sat died in 1916, the Wong family closed and locked the store, with much of its contents within: ‚Ä¶ original shop fittings, a variety of merchandise, account books and order notes. In doing so, the Wong family created an unintentional time-capsule, giving an insight to better: ‚Ä¶ understand how Australian rural stores sustained their communities by providing access to merchandise from across the world and much needed credit in hard times. Wong Family store. Bolong, NSW The contents and fittings of the Wong family store provide examples of aesthetic significance in the design, packaging and the manufacture of a late nineteenth century consumables and Chinese material culture. They also provide a tangible research tool for historians to explore the culture and politics of the Europeans and Chinese in Australia, which has alluded to: ‚Ä¶ contradictions to the omnipresent anti- Chinese attitudes in late nineteenth century Australia that manifested themselves in the Lambing Flat riots and racists colonial legislation and the acceptance and assimilation of Chinese families in many regional communities. The Wong family store collection was presented to the Powerhouse Museum by Robert Wong in 2003. Amelia Eve & Henry Along with the many artifacts associated with the Wong store, a large number of photographs were also donated to the Powerhouse Museum. The photographs were taken by two of Ah Sat & Amelia's children: Ameilia Eve Hackney Wong and Henry Hackney Wong (both were enthusiastic amateur photographers). The photographs they created include many portraits posing (well-dressed) in the rural landscape: ‚Ä¶ mainly informal, outdoor portraits and rural scenes. These photographs offer a rare glimpse into the Wong family's appearance, and personal effects.

Taxonomy and appearance rosette-like spots Individual with small, relatively widely separated spots Dark greyish individual with small spots, some arranged in clusters This species was originally described by ichthyologists Castex and Maciel in 1963. This species is densely spotted above, but the exact color and pattern are very variable. One of these types was initially described as a separate species P. castexi and another as P. menchacai. Intermediates between the various patterns are common, and all represent variants of the species P. falkneri. It reaches a disc width of up to and a total length, including tail, up to .

Background  The Pequot War of 1636 and 1637 saw the virtual elimination of the Pequot Indians. The victors, English colonists living along the Connecticut River and their Mohegan and Narragansett allies, met to decide on the division of the fruits of victory.  The treaty  The Mohegan and Narragansett tribes and the three English settlements that would become the Connecticut River Colony in 1639, participated in the treaty. Surviving Pequot prisoners were divided between the tribes, with an unspecified number of captives being kept by the English; each tribe received 80 captives, with 20 captives being awarded to Ninigret, a sachem of the Eastern Niantic who were allied with the Narragansett.Grant 2015, 497; Vaughan 1995, 341 The Pequot lands went to the Connecticut River towns. The other major feature of this treaty was to outlaw the Pequot name. Any survivors would be referred to in the future as Mohegans or Narragansett. No Pequot town or settlement would be allowed. This treaty was signed on September 21, 1638.Grant 2015, 497; Vaughan 1995, 341 The Massachusetts Bay Colony, which had also participated in the anti-Pequot alliance, was not a party to the Treaty of Hartford. This led to a dispute between Massachusetts and Connecticut, with the Bay colony insisting that the Treaty of Hartford usurped its rights over Pequot lands under previous agreements with the Narragansetts and the Mohegans.Grant 2015, 470-1  Further reading  *Daragh Grant, \\"The Treaty of Hartford (1638): Reconsidering Jurisdiction in Southern New England,\\" The William and Mary Quarterly, 3rd Ser., 72, No. 3 (July 2015): 461‚Äì98.

The Treaty of Hartford is a treaty concluded between New Netherland and Connecticut on September 19, 1650 in Hartford, Connecticut.  Background  In 1650, Dutch Director-General of New Netherland Petrus Stuyvesant went to Hartford to negotiate a border with the governor of English Connecticut colony Edward Hopkins. The Dutch colony of New Netherland was feeling increased pressure from the rising number of English colonists at its borders.  The treaty  Stuyvesant traded Connecticut land claims (the New Netherland claim encompassed the full length of the Connecticut River and as far east as Narragansett Bay) in order to get a clear boundary on Long Island. They agreed on a Connecticut line 50 Dutch miles west of the mouth of the Connecticut River. On Long Island, a line would be drawn south from the westernmost point of Oyster Bay, through modern Nassau County. The treaty was signed on September 19. In practice, the treaty simply reflected changed facts on the ground. Settlement of the Dutch colony had clustered around the Hudson River with only isolated trading posts on the Connecticut (including Fort Hoop, which would become Hartford, Connecticut). The exploding population of New England, and the splintering impulses of its religious-based colonies, had led to significant English settlement in the Connecticut River Valley, along the coast of Long Island Sound and on eastern Long Island.  Aftermath  Back in Europe, the Dutch West India Company approved the treaty, but the English government, which rejected all Dutch claims in North America as illegitimate, did not. In America, however, the agreement held straight through the English conquest of New Netherland in 1664. Indeed, the borders today between Connecticut and New York, and between Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island, are, with some minor adjustments, those negotiated in 1650.

Background  The colonial charters for New York and Massachusetts both described their boundaries as extending westward to the Pacific Ocean. However, both charters used distances from coastal rivers as their baselines, and thus both states could claim the same land. The area in dispute included all of western New York State west of, approximately, Seneca Lake, extending all the way to the Niagara River and Lake Erie, and north to south from the shore of Lake Ontario to the Pennsylvania border.  Terms  New York and Massachusetts agreed to divide the rights in question with a treaty signed December 16. The states agreed that all of the land in question, about 6 million acres (24,000 km¬≤), would be recognized as part of New York State. Massachusetts, in return, obtained the right of preemption, the title to all of the land, giving it the exclusive right to extinguish by purchase the possessory rights of the Indian tribes (except for a narrow strip along the Niagara River, the title to which was recognized to belong to New York). The compact also provided that Massachusetts could sell or assign its preemptive rights.  Aftermath In 1788 Massachusetts sold its rights to the entire six million acres (24,000 km¬≤) to Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham for $1,000,000, payable in specie or in certain Massachusetts securities then trading at about 20 cents on the dollar, the money used to repay some of the state's debt from the Revolutionary War. Similar western boundary issues involving these and other states were resolved by the Northwest Ordinance passed by the Congress of the Confederation in July 1787.

Campau had three trading posts and a store in Detroit until the early 1800s. He then embarked on a real estate career that made him very wealthy. Campau was also a newspaper man, establishing a newspaper with his nephew, John R. Williams. He held several city public offices for the city. Campau was an officer in the Michigan Territory Militia and during the War of 1812. Campau was a Roman Catholic until he was excommunicated for selling whiskey to Native Americans and having joined the Masons. Early life Joseph Campau was born on February 2, 1769 in Detroit. His parents were Jacques Campau and Catherine M√©nard. Campau's grandfather, Jacques Campau (1677-1751), left Montreal and settled at Fort Pontchartrain du D√©troit in 1708, one year after his brother Michel. Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac founded Fort Pontchartrain du D√©troit in 1701 and sold 68 land grants between 1707 and 1710, two of which were sold to the Campau brothers. Jacques had previously served as a secretary and an officer to Cadillac. Jacques sold furs, grains, and bread at \\"one of the finest merchant stores\\" in Detroit by the 1740s, according to Clarence M. Burton. In his youth, Joseph Campau traded with the Native Americans. His younger brother, Barnab√© aka Barnabas, was also a wealthy businessman. He was a fur trader, merchant, and landowner. One of his properties was Belle Isle. Career Campau began his business career as a merchant. He purchased goods from Boston, the first person to do so in Detroit, and sold them at his store on Atwater. Campau spoke the dialects of several Native American tribes, French and English to his customers at his three trading posts at Saginaw, on Lake St. Clair, and on Lake Erie. He was called Chemokamun (\\"big shot\\") by Chief Wawanosh of Sarnia and Chief Maccounse of Lake St. Clair. Campau was the first in the city's real estate industry to sell and lease houses that had been built on vacant lots. He was sometimes considered a \\"slum lord\\" who was likely to charge late fees with high interest rates to delinquent tenants. However, an obituary stated of Campau, \\"[t]o the honest and industrious, he was always lenient.\\" C.M. Burton asserts that he was the state's first millionaire. He had become the state's largest landowner, owning property worth more than $10 million. Campau held a large percentage of the stock in Michigan Central Railroad and Bank of Michigan. Campau held multiple public office positions. He was City Trustee in 1802, City Treasurer, City Inspector of water barrels and City Assessor, appraiser, and over-seer of the poor. In 1802, he was an original trustee of Detroit and its incorporation. He served in the Michigan Territory Militia as captain in 1806. During the War of 1812, he was a major in the U.S. Army. With his nephew, John R. Williams, Campau operated the Democratic Free Press and Michigan Intelligencer, which eventually evolved into the Detroit Free Press. Personal life and death Campau was married to Adelaide Dequindre on May 18, 1808. Their children, born through 1829, were Joseph, Adelaide, Dennis, Catherine, Jacques Joseph, Theodore Joseph, Matilda, and Alexander Timothy. His daughter Catherine married Francis Palms, the largest landowner in Michigan during the mid-1850s. Campau bought a nine-year-old African boy in Montreal as a slave who was to be freed at 21 years of age. Campau and Father Gabriel Richard, the priest of St. Anne's Church, engaged in \\"heated disagreements\\" about Campau's having sold whiskey to Native Americans and joining the Masons. As a result, he was excommunicated from the Catholic Church in 1817. Campou died on July 23, 1863, and was buried at Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit. The Masons held the largest funeral in the city's history until that time for Campau. His wife was buried at Catholic Mount Elliott Cemetery, as are some of his children. His estate was worth $3 million. Joseph Campau Street in Hamtramck was named for him, and by association, Jos. Campau Historic District. Joseph Campau residences Campau lived in a log house on the south side of Jefferson Avenue, between Shelby and Griswold, that was built after the fire of 1805. Frederick E.

They had a regional hit with the song \\"Sacrifice\\", which also received distribution overseas and managed to garnish airplay in parts of Europe, New Zealand, and Australia. Although they only released one single, they recorded numerous unissued tracks that would subsequently be released on CD between 2007 and 2008. The group reunited in 2007 and have since been active on stage and in the studio, releasing five CDs containing old and new material. \\"Sacrifice\\" and their version of \\"The House of the Rising Sun\\" were both featured in the film Jobs starring Ashton Kutcher. Their song \\"I Want to Tell You\\" was included in a scene from the ABC TV series Once Upon A Time. History =1960s= The Brymers were from San Joaquin Valley, California. They were founded by drummer Dick Lee in 1963, originally as the de-Fenders. Lee gathered several friends at Lemoore High School to form the band--all of whom were in the graduating class of that year. The band's earliest lineup consisted of Lee on drums, Bob Virdin on bass, and Ken Valentine on keyboards, as well as Jim Mellick and Mike Wagner on guitars. According to bassist Virdin, \\"Back then, a concert was a teen dance. Admission was $1.95 per person. Our band was the garage band of the ‚Äô60s. That‚Äôs where we practiced.\\" Mike Wagner departed shortly thereafter after being drafted by the Army. Eventually they changed their name to the Brymers. For a short time, at the recommendation of their talent agents, the group's members shaved their heads in the look of popular actor Yul Brynner, with the moniker \\"Brymers\\" as a pun on the famous actor's last name. They were taken to an upscale salon in Hollywood and filmed and photographed. \\"The result was four kids with bald heads and a band name no one could pronounce,\\" remembers Dick Lee. They sometimes played on the same bill as a group called the Sullies, who opened for them, and became friends with their lead singer, Steve Perry, who later went on to fame with Journey in the 1970s. Wishing to spend more time with his wife and raise a family, Virdin left the group in 1966 and was replaced by bassist Bill Brumley. Ken Valentine eventually departed and was replaced by Ken Sinner. The group signed with the Los Angeles-based Diplomacy Records and in late 1966 released a single featuring the fuzz-drenched \\"Sacrifice\\", backed with \\"I Want to Tell You\\" that became a regional hit. The song also garnished airplay overseas in parts of Europe, New Zealand, and Australia. After the success of \\"Sacrifice\\", they began touring regionally and elsewhere around the country. According to Virdin, \\"When you are on the road, it‚Äôs not what it‚Äôs made out to be ‚Äî unless you are at the top of the heap...\\" Virdin points out that one of the group's most memorable occasions was playing one night behind Chuck Berry as his pickup band. Uncharacteristic of many bands of the time, the Brymers avoided the use of alcohol and drugs. According to Lee, \\"There was no booze and no drugs. We stuck to that... That‚Äôs one of my proudest accomplishments was a band that did not do drugs or booze. The Brymers disbanded in early 1968. =Later events= After departing from the group in 1966 Bob Virdin sold his bass guitar and amplifier and left the world of music, going into the dairy business, where still works but is now semi-retired. Dick Lee currently lives in Eugene, Oregon. He owns his own record label, Valley Grown Records which released the compilation, California Nuggets: Fuzz, Mod Rock, and R & B Unknowns, Volume 1, which features 25 tracks from Central Valley bands from 1960 to 1970. He also hosts a music podcast that features much garage rock. In 2007, the Brymers reunited and held a concert in California, where they played to sold-out audience. According to Virdin, \\"There were probably 1,000 people, and when we came on stage, people went nuts. It would make the hair stand up on your neck. That was a lot of fun. They have since recorded new material in Lemoore, California and continue to play live gigs. Their current lineup is the same as in late 1966‚Äì1968: Dick Lee on drums, Bill Brumley on bass, Jim Mellick on lead guitar and harp, and Kenny Sinner on keyboards, saxophone. Like before all of the band members sing. The Brymers' work has come to the attention of garage rock enthusiasts. Though they only released one single in the 1960s, they recorded numerous unissued tracks. The Brymers have released five CD's made up of old and/or new material, including Sacrifice, which contains much of their early output and 40 Year Brotherhood, which features their newer recorings. The song, \\"Sacrifice\\" appeared on the Garage Punk Unknowns, Volume 1 CD, released by Crypt Records. CR-079 ‚Äì liner notes \\"Sacrifice\\" and their version of \\"House of the Rising Sun\\" (which remained unissued for years), are both featured in the film Jobs starring Ashton Kutcher. \\"I Want to Tell You\\" was featured in a scene of the hit ABC TV series, Once Upon A Time.

The stations tracked the movements of Allied warships and merchant vessels and became a valuable source of intelligence to the Axis, for attacks on Allied convoys. The British Government considered attacking the stations on two occasions during 1942 but decided instead to use diplomatic pressure to have them closed. The stations are believed to have ceased operations in January 1944. Early activities The German Abwehr and Italian intelligence services established a network of ship-watching positions along the Strait of Gibraltar in Spain and Spanish Morocco during the early years of World War II. This was conducted with the authorisation of the Spanish government led by Francisco Franco. While the ship-watching organisation was initially incompetent, by the northern autumn of 1941 it had grown into an effective source of intelligence. By this time the Axis forces were operating stations at Alboran Island, Algeciras, Cape Trafalgar, Cape de Gata, Cape Tres Forcas, Ceuta, M√°laga, Melilla, Tangier, Tarifa and Tetuan. Two of the stations were manned by Spanish personnel and the others by Spanish, German and Italian personnel. The Germans and Italians are believed to have worn Spanish uniform to conceal their presence. The station at Algeciras, which was directly across the Bay of Gibraltar from the British territory, was the most important and radioed at least 20 reports each day to Abwehr headquarters in Berlin. The British Government was aware of the Axis ship-watching network and monitored its activities by decoding the radio signals sent by Abwehr personnel. While the British had no way of countering the network in 1941, this intelligence enabled the development of limited counter-measures. Allied ships operating near Gibraltar, were instructed to sail during periods of poor visibility and take evasive courses. The British intelligence services were able to advise the naval command at Gibraltar of the ship movements which had been reported by Axis forces. Operation Bodden In late 1941, construction began on buildings to house German equipment which would allow ships to be tracked using infrared and other short-wave apparatus at nine sites on the northern shore of the Strait of Gibraltar and five on its southern shore in Operation Bodden. (Bodden are strips of seawater and lagoons separating Baltic islands from the German mainland.) The main technology used was the bolometer, which could to detect heat rising from nearby vessels and the first of these installations began operations in February 1942. Following approval from Franco the next month, the network was active by mid-April 1942. Thanks to Ultra intelligence gained from Abwehr radio messages, the British were able to monitor the installation of the new equipment and consider responses to it. Kim Philby of MI6 kept watch on Abwehr operations and consulted R. V. Jones, the Assistant Director of Intelligence (Science) at the Air Ministry. Jones inferred that Bodden was a plot to install an \\"infra-red burglar alarm\\" to count ships into and out of the Mediterranean. It appeared that there would be three parallel infra-red searchlight barrages, just west of Perejil Island, shining north towards Algeciras. The strait there was about across and Jones thought that the method could be unreliable because of twinkling just above the sea. A bigger infra- red detector with a longer range was to be set up near Algeciras pointing south to detect hot spots on ships such as funnels. If the devices became operational, the Navy would have to lag ship funnels or send decoys back and forth. On 7 March, the authorities at Gibraltar were warned by the Admiralty that ships operating near the territory could be tracked at night. In May 1942, the Chiefs of Staff Committee discussed attacking the sites by bombardments from submarines or raids by Combined Operations units. It was eventually decided to not attack the sites, for fear that it would provoke a Spanish attack on Gibraltar and the British Ambassador to Spain, Sir Samuel Hoare, was briefed on the scientific aspects of the German operation, without leaving clues that the source was Ultra and directed to raise the matter with the Spanish Government. Hoare insisted on meeting Franco to discuss the new ship-watching stations. During their discussion on 27 May, Hoare presented a detailed account of German activities in Spain and indicated that petrol supplied by Allied countries, had been used as part of the construction of the facilities. Franco denied that the network existed and claimed that the German personnel were providing technical assistance to Spanish coastal artillery batteries. Franco inferred that the ambassador's comments were a threat to cut off the supply of petrol and promised to conduct a personal inquiry into the matter. Franco met with the head of the Abwehr, Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, in June and directed that the stations be closed. On 3 June the Spanish admitted that the Germans had installed devices for coast defence but denied that facilities had been provided for \\"foreign interests\\" and offered an assurance that shipping would not be attacked using information from the installations. Canaris' subsequent attempts to persuade Franco to rescind this decision failed and the Spanish foreign minister provided Hoare with an assurance on 1 July, that the sites built during Operation Bodden would be shut down and the Germans sent home, yet the Germans claimed that information from the installations was used for an attack on a convoy passing the straits on the night of While these sites were no longer operational by mid-July, the Allies learned from Ultra decrypts, that the Germans were installing the equipment in new locations on Spanish territory. Algeciras on the left, directly across the bay to Gibraltar During July and August, two new bolometer sites commenced operations near Algeciras and Ceuta. These sites detected Operation Pedestal, a convoy bound for Malta, during the second week of August 1942 and Axis air, sea and submarine attacks led to many losses. Following this engagement, the British Chiefs of Staff Committee again considered countermeasures against the bolometer sites; the Governor of Gibraltar and Special Operations Executive proposed direct attacks on the facilities and the head of the Royal Navy advocated jamming them. During a meeting held on 25 August, the Chiefs of Staff decided to make another diplomatic protest, which was formally lodged with the Spanish Government in October. This protest did not lead to the closure of the stations and it is likely that they played a role in the Axis response to the Allied Operation Torch landings in North Africa in November 1942. The sites were not the only source of intelligence used to direct air attacks on Allied convoys, as the German Air Force conducted a daily reconnaissance flight over Gibraltar from September. The bolometer sites were dismantled during late 1942 and on 29 December that year, after the Spanish Government directed Canaris to cease intelligence activities in Spain to avoid giving the Allies a pretext to invade the country. German observation posts continued to be maintained in the Gibraltar area, though the German agents were gradually replaced with citizens of other countries and the sites declined in effectiveness. An attempt to reactivate the bolometer sites was made in mid-1943 but abandoned by July. Later in 1943, the Spanish Government, still under pressure from the Allied governments, ordered the closure of the remaining ship-watching stations and there is no evidence that any stations operated after January 1944. In 1981, Sir Harry Hinsley judged in the official history of British Intelligence in the Second World War that the ship-watching operation had been \\"the most important\\" form of assistance Spain provided to the Axis during the war. In 1943, Jones found that a German Elektra Sonne station was being set up near Lugo in north-west Spain as part of a navigation system for aircraft and U-boats. Jones used photographs of the station to work out how it worked and supplied Coastal Command with instructions to use it under the code-name Consol, since it was of more use to the British than the Germans and simpler than Gee.

Cybersecurity researchers as well as the United States government attributed responsibility for the breach to the Russian cyber spying group Fancy Bear, allegedly two units of a Russian military intelligence agency. Some or all of the Podesta emails were subsequently obtained by WikiLeaks, which published over 20,000 pages of emails, allegedly from Podesta, in October and November 2016. Podesta and the Clinton campaign have declined to authenticate the emails. Cybersecurity experts interviewed by PolitiFact believe the majority of emails are probably unaltered, while stating it is possible that the hackers inserted at least some doctored or fabricated emails. The article then attests that the Clinton campaign, however, has yet to produce any evidence that any specific emails in the latest leak were fraudulent. A subsequent investigation by U.S. intelligence agencies also reported that the files obtained by WikiLeaks during the U.S. election contained no \\"evident forgeries\\". Podesta's emails, once released by WikiLeaks, shed light on the inner workings of the Clinton campaign, suggested that CNN commentator Donna Brazile had shared audience questions with the Clinton campaign in advance of town hall meetings, and contained excerpts from Hillary Clinton's speeches to Wall Street firms. Since many of the emails contained bizarre references to \\"hot dogs\\" and \\"pizza,\\" they also formed the basis for Pizzagate, a conspiracy theory that posited that Podesta and other Democratic Party officials were involved in a child trafficking ring based out of pizzerias in Washington, D.C. Data theft ODNI declassified assessment of \\"Russian activities and intentions in recent U.S. elections\\" Researchers from the Atlanta-based cybersecurity firm Dell SecureWorks reported that the emails had been obtained through a data theft carried out by the hacker group Fancy Bear, a group of Russian intelligence-linked hackers that were also responsible for cyberattacks that targeted the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), resulting in WikiLeaks publishing emails from those hacks. SecureWorks concluded Fancy Bear had sent Podesta an email on March 19, 2016, that had the appearance of a Google security alert, but actually contained a misleading link--a strategy known as spear-phishing. (This tactic has also been used by hackers to break into the accounts of other notable persons, such as Colin Powell). The link--which used the URL shortening service Bitly--brought Podesta to a fake log-in page where he entered his Gmail credentials. The email was initially sent to the IT department as it was suspected of being a fake but was described as \\"legitimate\\" in an e-mail sent by a department employee, who later said he meant to write \\"illegitimate\\". SecureWorks had tracked the activities of Fancy Bear for more than a year before the cyberattack, and in June 2016 had reported the group made use of malicious Bitly links and fake Google login pages to trick targets into divulging their passwords. However, the hackers left some of their Bitly accounts public, allowing SecureWorks to trace many of their links to e-mail accounts targeted with spear-phishing attacks. Of this list of targeted accounts, more than one hundred were policy advisors to Clinton, or members of her presidential campaign, and by June, twenty staff members had clicked on the phishing links. On December 9, 2016, the CIA told U.S. legislators the U.S. Intelligence Community concluded that the Russian government * was behind the hack, and * gave to WikiLeaks a collection of hacked emails from John Podesta. Authenticity A declassified report by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and National Security Agency (NSA) noted that, \\"Moscow most likely chose WikiLeaks because of its self-proclaimed reputation for authenticity. Disclosures through WikiLeaks did not contain any evident forgeries.\\" Cybersecurity experts interviewed by PolitiFact believe that while most of the emails are probably unaltered, it is possible the hackers inserted some doctored or fabricated material into the collection. Jeffrey Carr, CEO of the cybersecurity company Taia Global, stated: \\"I've looked at a lot of document dumps provided by hacker groups over the years, and in almost every case you can find a few altered or entirely falsified documents. But only a few. The vast majority were genuine. I believe that's the case with the Podesta emails, as well.\\" Jamie Winterton of the Arizona State University Global Security Initiative stated, \\"I would be shocked if the emails weren't altered,\\" noting the longstanding Russian practice of promoting disinformation. Cybersecurity expert Robert Graham described the contents of some of the emails as authentic by using the DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) contained in these emails' signatures. However, not all of the emails have these keys in their signature, and thus could not be verified with this method. Publication On October 7, 2016, 30 minutes after the Access Hollywood tape was first published, WikiLeaks began publishing thousands of emails from Podesta's Gmail account. Throughout October, WikiLeaks released installments of these emails on a daily basis. On December 18, 2016, John Podesta stated in Meet the Press that the FBI had contacted him about the leaked emails on October 9, 2016, but had not contacted him since. On October 17, 2016, the government of Ecuador severed the internet connection of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London. The Ecuadorian government stated that it had temporarily severed Assange's internet connection because of WikiLeaks' release of documents \\"impacting on the U.S. election campaign\\", although it also stated this was not meant to prevent WikiLeaks from operating. WikiLeaks continued releasing installments of the Podesta emails during this time. Contents Some of the emails provide some insight into the inner workings of the Clinton campaign. For example, the emails show a discussion among campaign manager Robby Mook and top aides about possible campaign themes and slogans. Other emails revealed insights about the internal conflicts of the Clinton Foundation. The BBC published an article detailing 18 \\"revelations\\" revealed from their initial review of the leaked emails, including excerpts from Clinton's speeches and politically-motivated payments to the Clinton Foundation. One of the emails released on October 12, 2016, included Podesta's iCloud account password. His iCloud account was hacked, and his Twitter account was then briefly compromised. Some were emails that Barack Obama and Podesta exchanged in 2008. = Clinton's Wall Street speeches = WikiLeaks published transcripts of three Clinton speeches to Goldman Sachs and an 80-page internal campaign document cataloging potentially problematic portions of over 50 paid speeches. During the Democratic primary campaign, Bernie Sanders had criticized Hillary Clinton for refusing to release transcripts of speeches given to financial firms, portraying her as too close to Wall Street. Donald Trump first publicly called for the transcripts during a rally on October 3, 2016, four days before their publication by WikiLeaks: \\"I would like to see what the speeches said. She doesn't want to release them. Release the papers, Hillary, release those papers.\\" In the October 2016 presidential debate, Clinton voiced her support for a \\"no-fly\\" zone in Syria. In a 2013 speech, Clinton had discussed the difficulties involved. In particular, she noted that in order to establish a no-fly zone, Syria's air defenses would need to be destroyed. Because the Assad government had located these anti- aircraft batteries in populated civilian areas, their destruction would cause many collateral civilian deaths. Clinton's staff additionally flagged comments about regulation of Wall Street, as well as her relationship with the industry, as potentially problematic. The excerpts came up in the two subsequent presidential debates between Clinton and Trump. In one of the debates, the moderator Martha Raddatz quoted an excerpt saying that politicians \\"need both a public and a private position\\" and asked Clinton if it was okay for politicians to be \\"two-faced\\". Clinton replied, \\"As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called Lincoln. It was a master class watching president Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th amendment, it was principled and strategic. I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do.\\" In the third presidential debate, the moderator Chris Wallace quoted a speech excerpt where Clinton says, \\"My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders,\\" and asked if she was for open borders. Clinton replied, \\"If you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy. We trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined. And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders.\\" =Discussions of Catholic religious activities= Sandy Newman wrote to Podesta: \\"I have not thought at all about how one would 'plant the seeds of the revolution', or who would plant them.\\" Podesta agreed that this was necessary to do as Newman suggested and wrote back to note that they had created groups like Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good and Catholics United to push for a more progressive approach to the faith, change would \\"have to be bottom up\\". Raymond Arroyo responded: \\"It makes it seem like you're creating organizations to change the core beliefs of the church,\\" he said. \\"For someone to come and say, 'I have a political organization to change your church to complete my political agenda or advance my agenda', I don't know how anybody could embrace that.\\" Professor Robert P. George added that \\"these groups are political operations constructed to masquerade as organizations devoted to the Catholic faith\\". The leak revealed an email sent by John Halpin, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. The email discussed conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch's decision to raise his kids in the Catholic Church. He wrote, \\"Many of the most powerful elements of the conservative movement are all Catholic (many converts) ... It's an amazing bastardization of the faith. They must be attracted to the systematic thought and severely backwards gender relations and must be totally unaware of Christian democracy.\\" Palmieri responded: \\"I imagine they think it is the most socially acceptable, politically conservative religion‚Äîtheir rich friends wouldn't understand if they became evangelical.\\" Supporters and members of Donald Trump's campaign called the email exchange evidence of anti-Catholic sentiment in the Democratic Party. Halpin confirmed that he had written the email, though he contested claims that it was \\"anti-Catholic\\" and said that it was taken out of context and that he had sent the email to his Catholic colleagues \\"to make a fleeting point about perceived hypocrisy and the flaunting of one's faith by prominent conservative leaders.\\" = Presidential debate questions shared by Donna Brazile = On October 11, 2016, WikiLeaks released the text of an email sent by Donna Brazile on March 12, 2016, to Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri with the subject header \\"From time to time I get questions in advance.\\" The email included a question about the death penalty. The following day Clinton received a similar question from the Townhall host, Roland Martin. Brazile initially denied coordinating with the Clinton campaign, and a CNN spokesperson said \\"CNN did not share any questions with Donna Brazile, or anyone else for that matter, prior to the town hall\\" and that \\"we have never, ever given a town hall question to anyone beforehand\\". According to CNNMoney, the debate moderator Roland Martin did not deny that he shared questions with Brazile. In another leaked email, Brazile wrote: \\"One of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash. Her family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint.\\" At a debate in Flint the following day, a woman whose \\"son had developed a rash from the contaminated water\\" asked Clinton: \\"If elected president, what course will you take to regain my trust in government?\\" In a third email, Brazile added: \\"I'll send a few more.\\" CNN severed ties with Brazile on October 14, 2016. Brazile later said that CNN did not give her \\"the ability to defend myself\\" after the email release and referred to WikiLeaks as \\"WikiLies\\". Brazile repeatedly denied that she had received the question on the death penalty in advance and has said that the documents released by WikiLeaks were \\"altered\\". In an essay for Time written on March 17, 2017, Brazile wrote that the emails revealed that \\"among the many things I did in my role as a Democratic operative and D.N.C. Vice Chair [...] was to share potential town hall topics with the Clinton campaign.\\" She wrote, \\"My job was to make all our Democratic candidates look good, and I worked closely with both campaigns to make that happen. But sending those emails was a mistake I will forever regret.\\" = Saudi Arabia and Qatar = One leaked email from August 2014, addressed to Podesta, identifies Saudi Arabia and Qatar as providing \\"clandestine\\", \\"financial and logistic\\" aid to ISIS and other \\"radical Sunni groups\\". The email outlines a plan of action against ISIS, urges putting pressure on Saudi Arabia and Qatar to end their alleged support for the group. Whether the email was originally written by Hillary Clinton, her advisor Sidney Blumenthal, or another person is unclear. Reactions The American public's interest in WikiLeaks in October roughly coincided with a tightening presidential race between Trump and Clinton. According to an analysis of opinion polling by Harry Enten of FiveThirtyEight, the release of the emails roughly matched Clinton's decline in the polls, though it did not seem to have an effect on public perceptions of her trustworthiness. Enten concluded that WikiLeaks' activities were \\"among the factors that might have contributed to [Clinton's] loss.\\" Sociology professor Zeynep Tufekci criticized how WikiLeaks handled the release of these emails, writing, \\"Taking one campaign manager's email account and releasing it with zero curation in the last month of an election needs to be treated as what it is: political sabotage, not whistle-blowing.\\" In an op-ed for The Intercept, James Risen criticized the media for its reporting on emails, arguing that the hacking of the emails was a more significant story than the content of the emails themselves. Thomas Frank, writing in an editorial column for The Guardian, argued that the emails gave an \\"unprecedented view into the workings of the elite, and how it looks after itself\\". Glen Caplin, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said, \\"By dribbling these out every day WikiLeaks is proving they are nothing but a propaganda arm of the Kremlin with a political agenda doing [Vladimir] Putin's dirty work to help elect Donald Trump.\\" When asked to comment on the emails release, president Vladimir Putin replied that Russia was being falsely accused. He said, \\"The hysteria is merely caused by the fact that somebody needs to divert the attention of the American people from the essence of what was exposed by the hackers.\\"  See also  * 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak * Democratic National Committee cyber attacks * October surprise * Pizzagate conspiracy theory * The Plot to Hack America References External links * Podesta emails blog on Politico Category:2016 in American politics Category:March 2016 crimes Category:October 2016 events in the United States Category:Controversies of the 2016 United States presidential election Category:Data breaches in the United States Category:Email hacking Category:Hillary Clinton controversies Category:Information published by WikiLeaks Category:Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections ","title":"Podesta emails"},{"id":"51917308","text":"Bly is an extinct town in southwest Howell County, in the Ozarks of southern Missouri.

History =Early history= The congregation was established by approximately forty Jewish families living in Alexandria, Virginia, on September 4, 1859. The congregation went by the name Beth El Hebrew Congregation or the alternative name of Hebrew Congregation of Alexandria. For the High Holy Days of 1859, the congregation held separate services for those wishing to worship in the Orthodox tradition and those preferring a more liberal tradition. The two groups decided to worship together beginning in the following year's High Holy Days. Services were conducted in Hebrew with accompaniment from a choir and an organ. Services were held either in a rented space in the Young Men's Christian Association or in a congregant's home. By the 1860s, Beth El worshiped at a rented space in Stewart's Hall at the northeast corner of King and Pitt streets. During this period, some of Beth El's services were led by ordained rabbis, while others were led by lay leaders. By 1867, Beth El finally had a permanent rabbi, Dr. Leopold Lowensohn. =First synagogue= Beth El Hebrew Congregation historical marker on Washington Street, site of the congregation's first building. Beth El held a Purim ball on March 8, 1871, in order to raise funds to construct a synagogue building. The next month, Beth El's leaders decided to build the synagogue on land located on Washington Street, just north of Cameron Street. Construction began on June 26, and the building was completed by August 1871. Dedication and the first Shabbat services were held on September 1, 1871. The second floor served as the sanctuary, while the first floor was used for social purposes and the religious school. Three years later, Beth El purchased the land on which the synagogue was built from its owner, partially from funds raised from selling pews to twenty of its families. In 1873, Rabbi Lowensohn left Beth El, and he was replaced by Rabbi A.A. Bonnheim. A year later, several members accused Bonnheim of unbecoming conduct. After some deliberation, the majority of the membership gave a vote of confidence to the rabbi, and at least four families resigned in disgust and formed their own congregation. The families rejoined Beth El two years later when Bonnheim left Beth El. Following Bonnheim's departure, Beth El did not have another rabbi who stayed with the congregation for more than two consecutive years for several decades. =First schism= In 1914, a group of Beth El's members who were new immigrants from Eastern Europe decided they preferred Conservative Judaism to Reform Judaism.\\"Congressional Record\\". Government Printing Office. September 21, 2004.\\"Connect: Eileh HaDevarim\\". Agudas Achim Congregation. Retrieved June 26, 2011. The group left Beth El and established Agudas Achim Congregation. Despite the split, the two congregations remained on cordial terms.Kredo, Adam. \\"The big 1-5-0\\". Washington Jewish Week. April 23, 2009. p. 1, 22. =1930s and 1940s= Six days after Kristallnacht, Beth El's members convened in a special meeting. Benedict Weil, Beth El's president, proposed that Beth El hire Rabbi Hugo B. Schiff of Karlsruhe, Germany, as its permanent rabbi. Schiff had been known in Northern Virginia for his work with Rabbi Ulrich Steuer of Fredericksburg, Virginia's reform congregation. A graduate of the Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau and Erlangen University,\\"Rabbi Schiff to Be Moderator Of War Meeting in Alexandria\\". The Washington Post. June 20, 1944. p. 4. Schiff had been the spiritual leader of a congregation of 1,000 members in Germany and a member of the Great Synagogue Council of Baden.\\"Hadassah to Hear Refugee Rabbi\\". The Washington Post. September 16, 1940. P. 8. Rabbi Schiff had been imprisoned at the Dachau Concentration Camp. Because Schiff would enter the United States on a religious visa, the visa would be relatively simple to obtain, and otherwise restrictive visa quotas would not apply. Beth El's members enthusiastically approved the proposal. Schiff came to Beth El as its rabbi on April 18, 1939, bringing with him a Torah that had been rescued from Karlsruhe's destroyed synagogue. Virtually all Jewish residents of Karlsruhe who remained in the city died in the Holocaust.\\"Gedenkbuch f√ºr die Karlsruher Juden\\" (German). City of Karlsruhe. December 20, 2006. Retrieved April 7, 2011. Schiff expanded Shabbat services, reintroduced Bar Mitzvah and Confirmation ceremonies, hosted congregational Passover seders, organized an adult study group, and held lectures about the history of Jewish people.\\"Alexandria Rabbi To Lecture on History\\". The Washington Post. October 18, 1939. p. 17. The interior and exterior of the synagogue were refurbished. Under Schiff's leadership, Beth El's membership quadrupled within nine years. In 1941, Schiff became rabbi of the Arlington‚ÄìFairfax Jewish Center (since renamed Etz Hayim) on a part-time basis, which Beth El approved. Schiff also served as the rabbi of the Washington Hebrew Congregation during the summer months. Schiff became a professor of religion at Howard University in 1945.\\"Rabbi At Howard U.\\" The Chicago Defender. October 27, 1945. p. 6. Schiff resigned from Beth El on July 1, 1948, in order to become a full-time assistant rabbi at Washington Hebrew Congregation.\\"Dr. H.B. Schiff To Be Installed As Assistant Rabbi\\". The Washington Post. October 22, 1948. p. 23. =Rabbi Helfgott= C. Melvyn Helfgott, a newly ordained rabbi from Washington Hebrew College, became Beth El's religious leader in 1949. Instead of a conventional sermon during Shabbat services, Rabbi Helfgott moderated a series of adult discussions on Judaism. Shabbat morning services became more family-oriented. A youth group was formed. An adult-discussion group convened each Sunday morning. Helfgott formed a Jewish study group for young married adults. Helfgott led Beth El until May 1953. Rabbi Emmet A. Frank became Beth El's spiritual leader in April 1954.\\"Rabbi Frank Takes Post In Virginia\\". The Washington Post. April 22, 1954. p. 24. A graduate of the University of Houston and Hebrew Union College, Cincinnati, Frank had served as assistant rabbi for a congregation in Houston before joining Beth El. =New facility= Because Beth El's membership quadrupled in size during the 1950s, the congregation began to consider moving to a larger location. By 1952, Beth El held additional High Holy Day services at a nearby church, and Beth El did the same for Shabbat services by 1955. By 1955, Beth El held an additional Shabbat service at a nearby Baptist church. The religious school's enrollment had also increased similarly, and Beth El had begun to rent space at local school buildings. In 1955, Beth El purchased a wooded piece of land on Seminary Road for $42,500. Beth El sold its synagogue for $25,000. Plans for the new synagogue included a 440-seat sanctuary, a social hall large enough for 460 people, and 22 classrooms for the religious school. A fundraising campaign paid for some of the costs, and a mortgage paid for the remainder. Groundbreaking began on May 26, 1956. and the cornerstone was laid on February 10, 1957.\\"Cornerstone to Be Laid By Beth El Congregation\\". The Washington Post. February 8, 1957. p. D8. The building was formally dedicated on September 13, 1957.\\"2 Synagogue Dedications Set\\". The Washington Post. September 13, 1957. p. D2. =Advocacy of school desegregation= In 1954, the United States Supreme Court held in the case of Brown v. Board of Education that laws requiring students to attend different public schools based on their race is unconstitutional because separate facilities are inherently unequal.Huston, Luther A. \\"High Court Bans School Segregation: 9-to-0 Decision Grants Time to Comply\\". The New York Times. May 18, 1954. In response Senator Harry F. Byrd, Sr. organized the Massive Resistance movement to close public schools rather than desegregate them.\\"Brown v. Board of Education: Virginia Responds\\". State Library of Virginia. 2003. In 1958, Rabbi Frank criticized Byrd's massive resistance movement in his sermon during Kol Nidre services.\\"Protestants Defend Rabbi in Race Issue: Virginia Ministers Insist On His Right To Speak Out\\". The Baltimore Sun. October 4, 1958. p. 5. Segregationists in Virginia were quick to denounce Frank's sermon. Newspapers in southern Virginia, Washington, and New York criticized the sermon, and Frank received multiple threatening phone calls. while many rabbis and Christian churches in Metropolitan Washington supported Frank. A few weeks later, Frank was invited to speak about Judaism at Arlington Unitarian Church.\\"Area Church Emptied by Bomb Threat: Unitarians Forced To Cancel Rabbi's Arlington Sermon Bomb Scare Postpones Rabbi's Arlington Talk\\". The Washington Post. October 20, 1958. p. A1. Due to a bomb threat; the church was evacuated and the speech was canceled.\\"420 Persons Flee Church: Bomb Feared: Rabbi Was To Speak At Unitarian Service In Arlington. Va\\". The Baltimore Sun. October 20, 1958. p. 6. Frank said he would return to speak at the church the following Sunday because \\"I have a lot to say and I don't run that easy.\\"\\"Va. Church Bomb Scare Under Probe\\". United Press International. Daily Defender (Chicago, Illinois). October 21, 1958. p. A5. Frank said the bomb threat was the work \\"of a group of cowards who are afraid to come out into the daylight.\\" People from around the country mailed letters to Beth El in support of Rabbi Frank. At Frank's next sermon, he said that a \\"Jew who remains silent in the face of prejudice leveled at another group of God's children is traitorous to the basic principle of Judaism.\\"\\"Rabbi Frank Defies 'Religious Blackmail'\\". The Washington Post. October 25, 1958. p. D3. Referring to the people who violently supported segregation, he pointed to the Jewish concept of repentance and forgiveness, saying, \\"no man should be so merciless that he will not forgive even the most sordid actions of men.\\" Frank returned to speak at the church the next Sunday.\\"Rabbi Gives Sermon Postponed by Threat\\". The Washington Post. October 27, 1958. p. B1. In the audience was George Lincoln Rockwell, a neo-Nazi leader. On the church's lawn before his speech, Frank introduced himself to Rockwell and welcomed him to hear his speech. When Rockwell proposed that he meet with Frank later to clear up some misunderstandings, Frank agreed to do so. =Centennial= Beth El marked its centennial with a three-day celebration in March 1960.\\"Temple Beth El Starts 3-Day Centennial Celebration Tonight\\". The Washington Post. March 4, 1960. p. A9. =Second schism= On January 11, 1962, the Jewish Community Council stated it opposed public schools having celebrations of religious holidays such as Christmas. In response, Frank wrote a letter to the editor of The Washington Post saying there was nothing wrong with a public school having a celebration of Christmas together with a celebration of Hanukkah.Frank, Rabbi Emmet A. \\"...With Love\\" (letter to the editor). The Washington Post. January 26, 1962. p. A16. Frank wrote that such religious holiday celebrations were a way to teach children to respect others' religion. Many of Beth El's congregants were unhappy with Frank's letter. Opposition to the rabbi and lay leadership at Beth El resulted in 43 families leaving and forming in new congregation, Temple Rodef Shalom in Falls Church in 1962.\\"Reform Jewish Temple Formed In Falls Church\\". The Washington Post. July 28, 1962. p. C9. Frank left Beth El in 1969 after accepting a position at Temple De Hirsch, a Reform congregation in Seattle.\\"Departing Rabbi Champions 'Speaking Out'\\". The Washington Post. June 28, 1969. p. B8. Frank said he was proud of always speaking from his heart about what he believed to be true. =Expansion= By the mid-1960s, Beth El's synagogue was no longer large enough, particularly for its religious school, which had become overcrowded. A committee's proposal to expand the synagogue building included a larger social hall, additional classrooms, and a room for youth groups. The expansion plan was approved in 1967. Beth El's membership continued to grow through the early 1980s. With more of its families consisting of two parents with full-time careers and raising a family, fewer members were available to volunteer, and Beth El began to hiring employees to do the work that volunteers had always done. Due to the growing number of congregants, Beth El's rabbi, Rabbi Arnold G. Fink, found he was stretched too thin. Rabbi Amy Perlin became Beth El's first Assistant Rabbi in the summer of 1982. Fink retired in 2002, becoming rabbi emeritus.Pope, Michael Lee. \\"The Singing Rabbi ‚Äì Arnold Fink, 69, leaves lasting legacy in Alexandria's Jewish community\\". The Alexandria Gazette Packet. April 7, 2005. Rabbi Brett R. Isserow was named Beth El's senior rabbi.\\"Torah tablets mark historic synagogue\\". The Washington Times. March 24, 200. p. A2. A native of Johannesburg, Rabbi Isserow studied at the University of Witwatersrand and Hebrew Union College's Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati. He came to Beth El after serving as associate rabbi at Hebrew Benevolent Congregation in Atlanta. In 2017, Isserow announced his retirement, and Rabbi David Spinrad was selected as his replacement, while Isserow would remain on in the role of rabbi emeritus. Spinrad also served at Hebrew Benevolent Congregation in Atlanta before beginning his tenure at Beth El in July 2018.

It stretches along the 2.3 km long Beach of Comarruga. Until 1946 it made part of the former municipality of Sant Vicen√ß de Calders.  Location  Comarruga is located in the eastern part of the Costa Dorada, some 55 km to the West of Barcelona-El Prat Airport, near the popular tourist resorts of Calafell and Torredembarra. Developed in the 1950s and 1960s, Comarruga has become a popular tourist destination, particularly for families. A fine beach of golden sand stretching along more than 2 km is its main attraction.  Climate  Comarruga has a Typical Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: Csa) characterized with mild winters and hot summers. The rainiest season is the autumn, and the driest season is the summer. The sunshine hours are above 2,500.  History  The first written reference to Comarruga appears in 1180, when the abbot of Sant Cugat granted to Arnau Sunyer i Berenguer the place named \\"ipsum vilare de Coma Ruga\\", near the castles of Calders and Saint Vincent. The concession didn't grant the property of the pond of Comarruga, which belonged to the Monastery of Sant Cugat. In 1183 the abbot of the Monastery of Sant Cugat granted additional rights in favour of Bernat de Papiol who accepted the compromise of guarding and defending the properties of the monastery and its inhabitants. In 1887 the train station of Sant Vicen√ß de Calders was built within the lands of Comarruga. During the 20th century, this train station became one of the most important railway intersections in Catalonia. Due to this reason, a small neighborhood developed around it, mostly of railway workers and its families. During the Spanish Civil War, this station was attacked several times by the fascist army of General Franco. Thanks to the collaboration of Italian airplanes (hydroplanes) during the Christmas holidays of 1938 (between the 25th and the 29th), Comarruga was heavily bombed causing dozens of casualties. In 1892 the hot springs of the pond and small creek (riuet) of Comarruga were declared of public interest for its health properties by the Royal Academy of Medicine and Surgery of Barcelona. In 1920 a Hotel and Spa was built near the pond. This started the urban development of Comarruga which later in the 1960s and 1970s would become an important tourist town.  Demography  = Population = In 2015 the population of Comarruga was 4,074. = Languages = The two official languages are Spanish and Catalan. The regional and local governments almost exclusively use Catalan and public signs are usually written in this language. Spanish is the language of business and the most commonly spoken language among residents and visitors. Most young people have some knowledge of English. People working in the tourism industry may also speak other languages (French, Dutch, Russian, etc.). = Religion = There is a Roman Catholic church, built in 1956-57. Masses are offered in Spanish and Catalan.  Infrastructure  = Transportation = * Barcelona‚ÄìEl Prat Airport is located 56 km to the east of Comarruga. There is a train connection from Sant Vicen√ß de Calders station, through Barcelona-Sants every 30 minutes. * Comarruga's railway station (the official name is Sant Vicen√ß de Calders) is mostly used by commuter trains. Most of the day there are 3 trains per hour to Barcelona and 1-2 to Tarragona (2017). * Camp de Tarragona railway station, at 33 km to the west. It is used by the high-speed trains (AVE) Barcelona-Madrid. There are eleven connections per day (2017). * Comarruga is served by three motorways: AP-2 (El Vendrell-Zaragoza, and then to Madrid), AP-7 (French border-Vera) and C-32 (Autopista Pau Casals), to Barcelona‚ÄìEl Prat Airport and Barcelona along the coast. = Healthcare = * The nearest hospital (Hospital Comarcal del Vendrell) is located at El Vendrell, 8 km to the northeast.

Mavic series =Mavic Pro= Announced in September 2016, the Mavic Pro, which was released in late 2016 was the first of the Mavic series. The drone was considered to be one of the first personalized drones on the market, being capable of capturing 4K video, having a flight range of and a flight time of 27 minutes. In 2017, however, DJI announced the Mavic Pro Platinum which came with a longer flight time (30 mins), thanks to improved motor & performance, and re-designed propellers, making the Mavic both faster and more efficient. =Mavic Air= The Mavic Air, which was released in early 2018 was the first \\"pocket-sized\\" portable drone being able to capture 4k video at 30 FPS. The Air has a 3-axis gimbal and 25mm lens. The Air also has a SmartCapture feature, a three-directional environment sensing system and a max flight time of 21 minutes. Mavic Air 2, the model released in 2020, has the safety feature that warns users about nearby planes and helicopters via its controller. =Mavic 2 Pro and Mavic 2 Zoom= DJI Mavic Pro and Mavic 2 Pro DJI announced in August 2018, the Mavic 2 Pro and the Mavic 2 Zoom. Both drones consist of 10 obstacle avoidance sensors on all sides and a max flight time of 31 minutes. Both of the drones could also record 4K video at 30 FPS. The Mavic 2 Zoom features a 4√ó zoom feature (2√ó optical and 2√ó digital), and also featured a 12-megapixel camera. The Mavic 2 Pro features a Hasselblad camerahttps://www.dji.com/au/mavic-2/info#specs and Hyper Timelapse feature. = Mavic 2 Enterprise = On October 29, 2018, DJI announced the Mavic 2 Enterprise (M2E). Incorporating features from the Mavic 2 line of consumer drones, the Mavic 2 Enterprise includes three modular accessories for both first responder and industrial applications. It includes the M2E Spotlight (capable of 2400 lumens), the M2E Speaker (capable of playing 10 prerecorded messages at 100 decibels), and the M2E Beacon, a strobe visible three miles away and is designed to clear FAA night waivers for night inspections. = Mavic Mini = DJI announced the Mavic Mini on October 30, 2019 as a replacement for the now discontinued DJI Spark and positioning it as a beginner camera drone. Its camera is on a three-axis gimbal and features a 12MP sensor capable of 2.7K video at 30 FPS. The Mavic Mini shares similar design characteristics with the Mavic Pro and Mavic 2 series, though notable for its portability and overall small size. DJI's marketing behind the Mavic Mini focuses on the weight of the drone at , allowing it to bypass drone registration regulations in several western countries like the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. In Japan, a model was released with a smaller battery weighing less, to come in under Japan's similar limit. Plus has a range of 4 km. = Mavic Air 2= DJI released the new Air series member known as Air 2 on April 27, 2020. Air 2 has a 1/2 inch CMOS camera, 34 min flight time per battery, can travel up to 68.4 km/h. The remote controller of Air 2 features a new design of the Mavic family. DJI's standard controller mounts a cellphone at the bottom, forcing you to look down while watching the screen. Detailed illustrations for the new controller show a mount that holds the smartphone at the top, more in line of view. This resembles the mounting on the controller for the Anafi, a Mavic Air competitor made by DJI's French rival, Parrot.https://dronedj.com/2020/04/23/everything-we-know-about-dji- mavic-air-2/ The original Mavic Air uses an enhanced Wi-Fi radio control system. But the Mavic Air 2 upgrades to OcuSync 2.0, a dedicated radio system that runs in the 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz ranges (the system works in single and dual-band mode, 5.8 GHz is not supported in all regions). This promises less interference from ambient Wi-Fi networks. It also offers a better range of up to 10 kilometers.https://dronedj.com/2020/04/23/everything-we-know-about-dji- mavic-air-2/ In term of filming, Air 2 supports RAW format, 48MP mode, HDR video, and 240fps slow-motion mode.https://www.techradar.com/uk/how-to/dji- mavic-air-2-tips-and-tricks-7-ways-to-master-our-favorite-drone Mavic Pro = Portability = The Mavic will fold small enough to fit into a small bag (83mm x 83mm x 198mm). Its legs and propellers fold underneath and to the side of the drone to form a compact package. =Camera= The Mavic is equipped with the same camera as the Phantom 4 UAV. The camera is a 12MP camera that is capable of shooting 4K video at 24 frames per second (FPS). It is capable of 96 FPS when shooting in 1080p. Its camera keeps the same 60 Mbit/s bitrate seen in the Phantom 4. The lens in the DJI Mavic possesses a 78-degree field of view (FOV), whereas the Phantom 4 maintains a 94-degree FOV. =Speed and distance= The Mavic flies at a top speed of 65 km/h (40 mph) in sport mode. An improved Lightbridge system can livestream video at a distance of 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) in 1080p. = Obstacle avoidance = The Mavic uses FlightAutonomy technology to sense obstacles up to 49 ft (15m) away and allows the Mavic to bypass them or brake to hover, reducing accidents. = Battery life = DJI rates the battery life of the Mavic at 27 minutes of flight time in zero wind conditions. Max hovering time (0 wind) is 24 minutes, while normal flight drops to 21 minutes. =Gesture control= The Mavic is the first DJI drone to have gesture control. Users can wave their arms in specific patterns to trigger drone functions, such as taking a picture. =Controller= The Mavic Pro in its folded state. The Mavic controller is more compact than those for other DJI drones. It includes fold-out grips for smartphones and small tablets and has a built-in flight information display for flight without a smartphone or tablet. A switch on the Mavic allows it to operate in Wi-Fi mode independent of the controller (e.g., controlled directly from a smartphone). In Wi-Fi mode, all flight functions can be accessed using the DJI Go 4 app but with reduced range to a few hundred feet.ProPhotoUAV Retrieved 25 October 2016 = Intelligent Flight Modes = The Mavic Activetrack feature allows the Mavic to track an object without the user actively controlling the UAV. The Activetrack has three different settings: Trace, Profile, and Spotlight. The Trace feature also known as \\"Orbit\\" allows the Mavic to follow an object in a circular pattern while the object is in motion. When in Profile mode the Mavic will follow a moving object as well but always at the same, pre-set distance. Lastly, in Spotlight mode the aircraft camera will always point at the object and the flight course will be locked. The obstacle avoidance feature is not enabled in any of the Activetrack modes.  Updates  = Mavic Pro Platinum = At the 2017 IFA trade show, DJI announced the upgraded Mavic Pro Platinum. The upgraded version includes better battery life and improved noise reduction due to new propellers and electronic speed controllers. Mavic Pro Platinum  Mavic Air  DJI Mavic Air in the air.

History The church was founded adjacent to a Benedictine abbey in the 10th century, but was rebuilt over the centuries. The church held custody of the Holy Martyrs, patrons of Arona. The present church has a Baroque fa√ßade added by the Jesuits, who were assigned the church and monastery by Cardinal Carlo Borromeo in 1572, and remained till their suppression in 1773. The interior retains gothic elements of architecture and consists of a single nave with four lateral chapels. The fresco decoration was added between 1850 and 1852. The main altar has a 15th- century painting depicting an Enthroned Madonna between Angels and Saints by Ambrogio da Fossano, called il Bergognone. The church also has a painting by Palma il Giovane. The altar has bas reliefs depicting the four Martyrs, whose relics are sheltered here. The relics of Graziano and Felino were brought here from Perugia in 979, and those of Fedele and Carpoforo were brought from Como in 1200.

It was sold only at Japanese dealerships called Toyota Corolla Store next to the Corolla. The name \\"Nadia\\" comes from Nadizita, which means \\"–Ω–∞–¥–µ–∂–¥–∞\\" (\\"hope\\") in Russian. It is also known as the name of a woman.  Overview  The Nadia is a minivan-style tall wagon with a two-row seat developed based on the Ipsum. Although the total length is shorter than Ipsum, the wheelbase is the same, and it was divided into five-seater with no third row seat, so the seat space where the seat can be slid is not limited to the brother car (Ipsum and Gaia). It is wider than the first-class car Century. A wide range of seat arrangements was possible depending on the grade. At the beginning of the launch, the category of \\"5-seater wagons with high eyepoints\\" was prevalent in Europe, and Nissan's R'nessa, which has a similar concept, and Tino, and Toyota Opa handled by Toyopet stores were in a competitive relationship. The style is a rounded one-motion form similar to that of the second generation Estima, and the interior is designed differently from the siblings in the upper half of the instrument panel and the center console, and adopts a virtual center projection digital center meter. In 1999, the crossover SUV variant, type SU was added. The engines are all 2.0 L engines. Initially, the 3S-FE high-mechanism twin-cam engine with port injection and the 3S-FSE gasoline direct-injection (D-4) engine were installed in the 2WD standard car (5 number car). The D-4 engine car was equipped with a SuperECT with a flex lockup. The tire size was not Ipsum's 14-inch, but 195/60R15 size flat tires (215/60R16 for type SU added later) with the outer diameter up. Also, as a change from the base car, the front brake has been increased in diameter and the suspension has been changed because it is not necessary to assume a heavy multi-seater ride, and it is a sporty with plenty of strokes and improved responsiveness. It is shaken by the ride. It is the only \\"stepping type\\" parking brake among the three Ipsum brothers, and the notification type at the time of the Ministry of Transport is also N type compared to the M type of Ipsum and Gaia. The RV boom at the beginning of Heisei passed away, and the passenger car market was a vehicle that was sold during the transition period from wagons to minivans.  Timeline  * August 1998 ‚Äì Released. * October 1998 ‚Äì Customized car \\"American Billet Version\\" by Modellista appears. By installing special aero parts, it became a 3-number frame with a total width of 1,715 mm. Black metallic is available as a dedicated color (this can later be selected for normal models). * 1999 ‚Äì type SU added. At first glance, it seems that only the bumper and the wheel have been changed, but it is not limited to that. Overfenders are installed (the vehicle width exceeds 1.7 m, and 3 numbers are registered), the suspension is changed, and the outer diameter is slightly larger. There were a wide variety of changes, such as adopting the tires, and the SUV-like appearance came out more than the normal model. The model is changed due to the wide body specifications (SXN10H, SXN15H). In addition, the wheel of the first Harrier is diverted. * April 2001 ‚Äì Minor change. The new generation D-4 engine, 1AZ- FSE engine is installed in the 2WD vehicle. On the exterior, the design of the headlamp and taillamp was changed, and some grades were equipped with a discharge headlamp (common to Toyota's first Hi/Lo), and the design of the standard grille and front bumper was also changed. For the interior, the steering design was changed, the meter was converted to analog and Optitron, the auto air conditioner was changed for all cars, the design of the air conditioner panel was changed, and the audio panel was changed to wide 2DIN. The L grade has a power seat for the driver's seat and the S grade has a bench seat. * 2002 ‚Äì Partially improved and all models use D-4 engine. * October 2003 ‚Äì End of production.

He was also heavily involved in the campaign for an independent East Timor as well as the anti-racism movement and a number of other causes. He was a dedicated trade unionist, a Secretary of the Northern Territory branch of the Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia and a co-founder of the Northern Territory Trades and Labor Council.  Early life  Brian Manning was born in Mundubbera, Queensland. In 1941 he moved with his family to Brisbane. He attended Brisbane High School until the age of seventeen, leaving to work as a junior clerk. In the following years he worked as a storeman, labourer, spray painter and builder. He moved to Darwin in 1956, working in a number of occupations including carpenter, patrol officer, fireman and manager of the Darwin Workers‚Äô Club.

He returned from attending a CPA Congress in Melbourne in 1961 with a copy of the constitution of the Victorian Council on Aboriginal Rights (VCAR) and suggested to them they form a similar organisation. The proposal was well received and the Northern Territory Council for Aboriginal Rights (NTCAR)http://indigenousrights.net.au/organisations/pagination/northern_territory_council_for_aboriginal_rights Northern Territory Council for Aboriginal Rights (NTCAR) was founded at a meeting of 26 Aboriginal and two white Australians. Manning recounts how at the time it was common for conservative non-indigenous forces to stack out indigenous support organisations to prevent them effectively representing indigenous interests. To prevent this, he was instrumental in inserting a clause into the NTCAR constitution stipulating that 75% of the executive would be from an indigenous background. Manning himself was elected Assistant Secretary. In the following years the organisation worked against discrimination and in favour of equal wages for Aboriginals. It also pushed for the North Australian Workers Union (NAWU), of which Manning was a member, to take up the cause of equal pay for indigenous workers.Brian Manning (2003).

Incensed by this treatment of individuals and seeing it as a way of challenging the White Australia policy, Manning and other activists formed an Anti-Deportation Committee and organised a petition against their expulsion. The three men were known and popular in the Darwin community and a rally and march in September 1961 in their support attracted thousands. Supported by members of the community, the men went into hiding. Manning and others in the committee coordinated their movement between houses as homes suspected of harbouring them were searched on a regular basis. The men were granted a respite on 26 September, when they obtained a promise that their cases would be reviewed in return for them reporting daily to Immigration. They were flown to Melbourne where they were feted by a support movement which targeted the Immigration Minister with protests. Upon their return to Darwin it became clear Immigration was again planning their deportation. Manning and others drove them out of Darwin to a property where they remained for the remainder of the campaign. With the campaign gaining increasing prominence around the country and highlighting opposition to the White Australia policy, the Federal Government relented and allowed them stay in early 1962.Brian Manning. The ‚ÄòStayput‚Äô Malayans. http://roughreds.com/rrtwo/manning.html  The Wave Hill Walk-off and Strike  In 1966 Vincent Lingiari led a walk off of the Gurindji peoplehttp://www.nma.gov.au/online_features/defining_moments/featured/wave_hill_walk- off Walk off of the Gurindji people at the Wave Hill cattle station, south of Darwin, in protest over wages and conditions which were then a fraction of their non-indigenous counterparts. Although occupied by the international food company Vestey Brothers, the station was on the traditional land of the Gurindji people. The strikers initially camped on the Victoria River, but the following year moved to Wattie Creek, traditionally called Daguragu by the Gurindji, and changed their demand to one of return of their traditional lands. Before the strike Manning and other union activists had anticipated industrial action at Wave Hill and arranged that in the event of it the Gurindji would send them a telegram. As a waterside worker, Manning was then a member of the North Australian Workers Union (NAWU), the union which also covered pastoral workers. Working with Dexter Daniels, the official NAWU indigenous organiser, Manning arranged the transport of supplies from the union to support the strike, initially at Victoria River, using his TJ Series Bedford truck. As Manning recounts it, the initial journey was a difficult sixteen-hour journey on the rough corrugated road, travelling at only fifteen or twenty miles an hour at times and putting stress on the truck and occupants. Meeting with Lingiari and speaking with the strikers, Manning and Daniels promised to support them for the duration of the strike, an undertaking significant as a previous strike by the Gurindji in 1953 had failed through lack of support. The truck was used in other ways to support the strike, such as transporting others from Hooker Creek to join the action. Manning recounts how his presence was greeted with hostility from a senior Darwin based Welfare Department Executive Officer and from the local police officer. Manning used the first visit to organise details of ongoing support. Back in Darwin he organised an ongoing roster using the truck to carry supplies, although he reports that over a dozen or so trips the original timber tray on the truck, ‚Äúliterally shook to pieces‚Äù. He also worked with the NTCAR to organise wider awareness of and support for the action around the country. He was elected as a delegate to the Waterside Workers Federation‚Äôs All Ports Conference in Sydney, where he was instrumental in a decision to levy $1.00 per member nationally to support the Gurindji action. The Gurindji struggle lasted nine years. In Daguragu the Gurindji petitioned the Governor General, Lord Casey, for return of their land. Although this was refused, they set about establishing a permanent settlement, constructing shelters, planting trees, establishing a vegetable garden and eventually building a store and more substantial housing. In March 1971, the Gurindji formed the ‚ÄòMurramulla Gurindji Company‚Äô to further press their claim. Manning continued to make regular visits of support throughout this period. The strike highlighted for the wider community the poor conditions and discriminatory conditions under which many indigenous people were forced to live. It also provided impetus to the growing Land Rights movement Australia wide. The Whitlam Government came to power in 1972 on a platform in support of Aboriginal Land Rights. On 16 August 1975 Prime Minister Whitlam travelled to Daguragu and, creating a now famous image, symbolically handed soil to Vincent Lingiari, transferring leasehold title to the Gurindji people. In 1985 the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Clyde Holding presented freehold title. Manning was invited to both ceremonies by the Gurindji people.Brian Manning. 6th Vincent Lingiari Memorial Lecture. 2006. http://indigenousrights.net.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/384149/f81.pdfBrian Manning‚Äôs speech on the 45th Anniversary of the Gurindji walk off - http://chriswhiteonline.org/2011/09/2003/Gosford, R.

This signaled the imminent withdrawal of Portugal from its colony of East Timor, 300 kilometres to the north of Darwin. In 1974 Manning travelled to the territory, establishing links with leaders of the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (Fretilin). Upon this return he formed the Darwin branch of the Campaign for an Independent East Timor (CIET) with Robert Wesley-Smith and other activists. He visited again as part a trade union delegation in May 1975, travelling the country, learning about Fretilin programs and the situation in East Timor. Anticipating an Indonesian invasion Manning and other CIET activists provided Fretilin with a number of radio transceivers in late 1975. When Indonesia invaded East Timor on 7 December 1975, Radio Maubere, as it was called became the main Fretilin link to the outside world and source of information about the situation in East Timor. It functioned until the capture by the Indonesian military of its Fretilin operator, Alarico Fernandes, in late 1978. For the first months messages were relayed by Telecom, the state owned telecommunications company, until it was ordered by the government to cease doing so. Manning and other CIET activists also operated a two-way radio communication, but this was confiscated by Telecom 27 January 1976. Working with CIET activist and fellow communist Denis Freney in Sydney, Manning then organised a series of volunteers to operate a clandestine radio link from bush locations in the following years, changing position on a regular basis to avoid detection. Although a number were caught and charged another was back on the air on each occasion in a short period of time. To avoid operators from having to compromise their security by returning to Darwin with the received messages, Manning established a secondary receiving post on a property he purchased outside of Darwin, equipped with a professional radio mast. Volunteers would record the Fretilin broadcasts, pass them to Manning who sent them to Freney in Sydney, who in turn transcribed them and sent them on to Fretilin missions in New York and Mozambique. They were also them as the basis of media releases and in the CIET publication East Timor News and the Melbourne based Timor Information Service newsletters. In edition Manning established what he referred to as the ‚Äúpublic radio‚Äù, using which he would surreptitiously take journalists and others, including Labor MP Ken Fry, to bush locations make contact with and interview Fernandes. In a period in which Indonesia kept East Timor closed to the outside world the radio link provided information on ongoing Fretilin resistance and the very serious humanitarian and human rights situation during the Indonesian invasion and occupation. Manning continued his activism for an independent East Timor during the 1980s and 1990s. He attended Fretilin Congress in independent Timor-Leste in 2011 where he was applauded by Fretilin members for his activism in support of independence.Brian Manning.

Its stated mission is to provide affordable space launch services to the world's fast-growing small satellite industry. The maiden launch of its first commercial orbital vehicle, called Eris, is planned for 2022. Eventually, the company is also looking to provide low-cost space access for human spaceflight and exploration. Founding Gilmour Space was founded in 2012 in Singapore by former banker, Adam Gilmour. In 2013, the Australian CEO & Founder set up similar operations in Queensland, Australia with his brother James Gilmour. The company's first project in 2013 was to design and manufacture high-fidelity spaceflight simulators and replicas for a number of space-related exhibits, and education centres, including Spaceflight Academy Gold Coast, Australia's first astronaut training center. It began its rocket development program in 2015; and within 18 months, successfully launched Australia and Singapore's first privately developed hybrid test rocket using proprietary 3D printed fuel. Gilmour Space's Series A and B investors include Blackbird Ventures, Main Sequence Ventures and 500 Startups. Their Advisors include ex-NASA administrators, Professor Dava Newman and Colonel (Retired) Pamela Melroy. Technology =Rocket Archetype= Rasta Launch Gilmour Space employs a proprietary hybrid rocket motor technology that it believes overcomes many of the traditional challenges of hybrid rockets. A hybrid-propellant rocket utilises a mixture of solid and liquid fuel. Advantages of hybrid rockets include acceptably high specific impulse values with relatively very low complexity and associated risks. In general, hybrid rocket engines are the safest of the three major rocket engines ‚Äì e.g. as compared to a solid-propellant rocket which cannot be deactivated or throttled (unless it is built in) once ignited; and a liquid-propellant rocket which typically requires cryogenic fuel storage and complex turbine systems to provide sufficient combustion chamber pressure both for the fuel and the oxidiser (hybrid-propellant rocket only requires pressurising the oxidiser). =Engine Development= Gilmour Space was the first private rocket company in Australia to launch a proprietary hybrid rocket in June 2016. The RASTA launch vehicle is reported to have flown to an altitude of 5 km, and is said to the one of the world's first flight demonstrations of 3D printed rocket fuel. Since then, the Queensland-based company has conducted a series of large hybrid engine test fires, including a 17-second test in August 2018 that recorded 80 kN (80,000 lbs) of thrust and a 110-second mission duration test-fire in July 2020. The company designed and built its own mobile rocket launch platform in 2018-19 (as there were no commercial Australian launch sites at the time), and a second test launch was attempted with the One Vision suborbital rocket in June 2019. Unfortunately, the rocket failed in the final seconds on the launchpad due to an anomaly in the pressure system affecting the oxidiser tank. According to the company, a detailed investigation into the anomaly resulted in 15 key recommendations that have since been implemented in the new orbital rocket design. The company has since focused its attention on developing Eris, a three-stage orbital launch vehicle that will launch commercially to orbit from 2022; and it is actively seeking partners, such as Australia's Defence Science and Technology group, to test and manufacture its orbital launch vehicles in Australia. =Deep Space & Exploration Research= Gilmour Space has also supported a number of proof-of-concept technology projects related to the development of a long-term space habitat. An example is the M.A.R.S (Mars Aqua Retrieval System) rover project, a collaborative educational project at SUTD which received an award at the 2016 ASME international student competition. and was featured in National Geographic‚Äôs Exploring Mars exhibit in Singapore. The company is also working on an in-space cubesat propulsion system, which could potentially be used to send a 1U cubesat from Earth's orbit to that of other moons or planets in the solar system. In Feb 2018, it signed a reimbursable Space Act Agreement with NASA to collaborate on various research, technology development and educational initiatives, including the testing of its MARS rover at Kennedy Space Center. =Spaceflight Simulators= The company has earlier developed a number of unique high-fidelity spaceflight simulators and replicas, including a 6 degree-of-freedom space plane simulator, space capsule simulator, fighter cockpit trainers, low gravity climb, mission control simulators, and others. In February 2017, the Design Business Chamber of Singapore awarded Gilmour Space with the Singapore Good Design Mark (SG Mark 2017) for excellence in design and quality of its simulators. Funding and Awards In fourth quarter 2016, its then-Singapore business was awarded a grant by the country's National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Cluster (NAMIC) to develop aerospace-related additive manufacturing capabilities with the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). In May 2017, Gilmour Space secured AUD 5 million in Series A round funding to develop and launch a low-cost launch vehicle for the small payload market. The lead investor was Australian venture capital firm Blackbird Ventures, with co-investors including global venture capital firm 500 Startups and other private investors. The company has also been awarded other grants by Advance Queensland in Australia, and the Singapore Economic Development Board. In June 2018, it received the Australian Trade & Investment Commission Innovation Award by the Australian Chamber of Commerce, Singapore \\"for the individual or organisation that has demonstrated innovation through bringing progressive and new ideas to business in priority sectors\\". In Sept 2018, the company became of the first Australian space companies to raise a Series-B investment round of USD 14 million, led by CSIRO venture capital arm, Main Sequence Ventures. In June 2019, Gilmour Space CEO Adam Gilmour was named the Advance Award winner in Advanced Manufacturing. The Advance Awards showcases the work of Australian citizens or residents who have made a significant global contribution overseas across selected industries. In Nov 2019, Adam was made a member of the Australian Space Agency's Space Industry Leaders Forum, which keeps the Agency informed on industry relevant issues and provides a coordination point for the civil space sector. In Dec 2019, Gilmour Space signed a statement of strategic intent with the Australian Space Agency as a demonstration of its commitment to launch Australia to space. In 2020, Gilmour Space was awarded a $3 million Cooperative Research Centres Projects (CRC-P) and a $0.25 million Advanced Manufacturing Growth Center (AMGC) grant, to work with partners to manufacture new composite parts for rockets.

He became a contributor to Bolster's Quarterly Magazine, an antiquarian journal published in Cork, and so became acquainted with a number of Irish archaeologists and literary men, including Abraham Abell, William Willes, Matthew Horgan and Francis Sylvester Mahony. With these colleagues Windele made many excursions, examining and sketching ruins and natural curiosities. He was particularly interested in searching for the early records engraved on stone known as Ogham inscriptions, and he saved many of them from destruction by removing them to his own home, where they formed what he termed his megalithic library. One of these engravings was later sent to University College Cork, and the others to the Royal Irish Academy. Windele also devoted much time to the study of early Irish literature, and he made a large collection of manuscripts. Windele died at his home, Blair's Hill, Cork, on 28 August 1865. He left a collection of manuscripts extending to 130 volumes, which were purchased by the Royal Irish Academy in 1865. They included copies of many early Irish manuscripts.

It was situated near government agencies for the Ho-Chunk and Ojibwe. By its very presence, however, the fort spurred immigration into the area by whites. The post, initially named Fort Marcy, was briefly renamed Fort Gaines and in 1850 was renamed again after Brigadier General Eleazer Wheelock Ripley, a distinguished soldier from the War of 1812. It was the second major military fort established in what would become Minnesota, after Fort Snelling in 1819. Fort Ripley was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 for its state-level significance in the themes of historical archaeology and military history. It was nominated for its status as Minnesota's second major military post and for its role in maintaining peace and enabling white settlement in Central Minnesota. Camp Ripley, a training facility operated by the Minnesota National Guard, was established in 1929. It includes the site of Fort Ripley and was named in its memory. The nearby city of Fort Ripley, Minnesota, was also named after the outpost. Description Fort Ripley typified remote army posts during the mid-19th century. The buildings were wooden, facing a quadrangle. It was on a navigable river and an important supply route. It was geographically remote from European-American population centers, but Native Americans lived nearby. History Fort Ripley was built because the Ho-Chunk had been moved from northeastern Iowa to a new reservation near Long Prairie, Minnesota, necessitating a military post nearby to guard the reservation and administer annuity payments. The government also hoped that the Ho-Chunk, and the fort, would serve as a buffer between the Eastern Dakota and Ojibwe, who were warring. Construction began in November 1848. In April 1849, Company A of the 6th Infantry Regiment arrived to take up quarters under the command of Captain John Blair Smith Todd. With occasional exceptions, daily life at Fort Ripley was uneventful. The geographic isolation, summer mosquitoes, and long, cold winters challenged everyone on post. The fort watched over the oxcart trains across the river traveling the Woods Trail on their way between the Selkirk Settlement in British North America and Saint Paul in Minnesota Territory. Twice each year, the soldiers marched to the Long Prairie Agency to supervise government annuity payments of money and goods to the Ho-Chunk and then did the same for the Ojibwe at the Crow Wing Agency. In 1855, the Ho-Chunk were forced to move again‚Äîthis time to a reservation in Blue Earth County, Minnesota. Thinking the post was no longer needed, the army withdrew the garrison in 1857. Almost immediately, disturbances broke out between settlers and some Ojibwe, prompting reactivation of the fort. The Fort was garrisoned by A & G Companies 20th Infantry in April of 1969. A Co. was immediately posted forward with G Co remaining until December 1877.The 20th Regiment of Infantry, The Army of the US Historical Sketches of the Line and Staff with Portraits of the Generals in Chief, Captain J.N. Coe, New York Maynard, Merrill and Company, 1896, p.666, U.S Army Center of Military History website Typical of 19th-century army posts, Fort Ripley's military reservation was huge. It encompassed nearly on the east side of the Mississippi, plus a single square mile on the west side to house the garrison. This unusual configuration, chosen because the Ho-Chunk reservation abutted the west bank of the river, caused much agitation among those who wanted the unused east side opened to homesteaders. The army agreed in 1857 to sell it in public auction, but local farmers, by mutual pact, underbid the property. The Secretary of War annulled the sale. In the meantime, however, many purchasers had begun to build homes and farm the land. The resulting confusion and litigation took 20 years to untangle. Military activity on the post intensified during the American Civil War. In January 1861, C and K Companies of the 2nd Infantry were sent south to fight Confederates,The Second Regiment of Infantry, The Army of the US Historical Sketches of the Line and Staff with Portraits of the Generals in Chief, Lt. M.W. Wright, New York Maynard, Merrill and Company, 1896, p.414, U.S Army Center of Military History website and were replaced by companies A and F from the 2nd Minnesota Infantry Regiment. Despite an undercurrent of mistrust, relations between European-Americans and Ojibwes had largely been peaceful in Minnesota. That nearly changed when the Dakota War of 1862 broke out. Seizing upon that conflict as an opportunity to gain power and leverage for redress of grievances, Ojibwe leader Hole in the Day threatened to launch a simultaneous war in northern Minnesota. Fearful whites in the area flocked to Fort Ripley for protection. Additional soldiers were rushed in and the post was readied for battle. The threat was defused, thanks to cool-headed negotiating and the garrison's strengthened defenses. For the next three years Fort Ripley became a base for western military campaigns that came on the heels of the U.S.-Dakota War. Activity reached its peak during the winter of 1863‚Äì1864, when 400 cavalry troops and 500 horses were quartered at the fort. On a sub- zero night in January 1877, fire destroyed three buildings. Believing the post had outlived its purpose, the War Department decided to permanently close it rather than rebuild. The troops moved out that summer. The buildings stood abandoned for many years. By 1910, the ruins of the gunpowder magazine, built of stone, were all that remained. Legacy Fort Ripley historical marker directly across the Mississippi River from the original site In 1929, the State of Minnesota announced that a new National Guard training site would be built in central Minnesota. The land had to be purchased and, purely by coincidence, the remains of old Fort Ripley were within the proposed boundaries. The new post‚ÄîCamp Ripley‚Äîtook its name from the old.

It became an international trend as of summer in 2016, with numerous videos of people attempting the activity being posted online. With its popularity, the repetitive thuds of multiple attempts have been criticized as a distraction and a public nuisance. Parents and teachers have expressed frustration at the practice, resulting in water bottle flipping being banned at a number of schools around the world, as well as many people calling for the practice to only be performed on private property, if at all.  History  In 2016, a viral video of a teenager, Michael Senatore, flipping a water bottle at a talent show at Ardrey Kell High School in Charlotte, North Carolina popularized the activity.  Description  Water bottle flipping involves taking a plastic water bottle that is partially empty and holding it by the neck of the bottle. Force is applied with a flick, with the bottom of the bottle rotating away from the person. If performed successfully, the bottle will land upright. Additionally, the bottle may land upside-down, or on its cap. Doing this is significantly more difficult than flipping a bottle so it lands upright. The amount of fluid in the bottle greatly influences the success of the feat, and it has been shown empirically that filling the bottle about one-third of the way improves the rate of success. The type of water bottle also plays a role; for instance, the brand Deer Park Spring Water has been noted to make the task easier due to its unique hourglass shape with a third divot. The feat is often performed with disposable plastic water bottles due to their availability, but other containers can be used as well. The bottle flip is often combined with the Dab after a successful flip. The complex physics behind the activity incorporates concepts of fluid dynamics, projectile motion, angular momentum, centripetal force, and gravity. In 2018, a group of students and professors from the Netherlands developed a minimal model of the water bottle flip involving conservation of angular momentum and, most importantly, the redistribution of mass along the bottle. The model estimates that the best filling fractions for water flipping lie in the range between 20% and 40%. Multiple mobile apps have been created to recreate the activity; the app \\"Bottle Flip 2k16\\" was downloaded 3 million times in the first month of its release.

It was once the richest gold mine for its size in the world. Establishment The Nobles Nob deposit was first prospected by blind cattleman Bill Weaber and his wife Kathleen, who came to Tennant Creek from Wyndham in Western Australia, arriving on 16 November 1933. He began prospecting the following day with prospector Jack Noble, who was blind in one eye. Noble is best known for discovering The Pinnacles in Western Australia and Wheal Doria mines in Tennant Creek. Kathleen Weaber, later named the mine after him. Weaber was granted four leases on the site on 2 March 1934, pegged out by Noble. The mine was bought by Australian Development NL in 1937. The Weabers left Tennant Creek in 1940 following a series of family tragedies. They sold the lease, unaware of the mine's potential. A battery was operational at the mine by 1947. Production During the mine's life, Nobles Nob produced over a million ounces (32 tons) of gold. By 1949, the mine's ore was valued at ¬£1,003,860. Nobles Nob produced assays which regularly exceeded 100 oz (3.2 kg) of gold per metric ton. One particularly rich area within the ore body produced over 300 oz per ton. A worker, Mr. Veskimae, was electrocuted at the mine on 6 November 1951. In August 1953, the mine dismissed 57 workers for striking over the poor quality of food at the mine. Local residents billeted the sacked workers, and the mine was 'declared black' by the North Australian Workers' Union. The workers' jobs were reinstated two weeks later. The main shaft collapsed at 5 am on 11 August 1967. There were no fatalities, and Nobles Nob became an open-cut mine. Milling resumed in January 1968 using stockpiled ore from the caved-in area. It closed on 14 January 1985 after almost 50 years of production. The announcement followed the production of only 7299 ounces of gold in the prior financial year. The Nobles Nob lease is currently owned by Excalibur Mining.

It spearheaded a legal battle against Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant.  History  Poovulagin Nanbargal started in Chennai, Tamil Nadu in the late 1980s, by the Indian Overseas Bank employee Nedunchezhiyan. He was associated with the Amnesty International India. The organisation introduced literature related to environmentalism to the Tamil language. Nedunchezhiyan died in 2006 at the age of 48. After his demise, the organisation stopped its activities. In 2008, nine men, including IT engineer G. Sundarrajan and Siddha medicine practitioner G. Sivaraman, regrouped the organisation. When the People's Movement Against Nuclear Energy (PMANE) started protests against the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant, Poovulagin Nanbargal gave legal support to the PMANE. To govern its activities, Poovulagin Nanbargal was registered as a public trust.  Publication  Poovulagin Nanbargal has published articles about ecology, as well as about the Green Revolution in India and its impact on agriculture. In the early 1990s, when India liberalised its economy, the organisation issued pamphlets about the effect of globalization. It has translated environment-related books, including Japanese agriculturist Masanobu Fukuoka's The One-Straw Revolution and Rachel Carson's Silent Spring. It has also translated works of Vandana Shiva and Sandra Postel into Tamil. The organisation publishes a bimonthly environmental magazine called Poovulagu and a children's magazine called Minmini.  Legal cases  After the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, Poovulagin Nanbargal filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in the Madras High Court in October 2011 to stop the commission of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant. In August 2012, the court accepted the Nuclear Power Corporation of India's assurance on safety of the plant and dismissed the petition. Poovulagin Nanbargal appealed to the Supreme Court of India, but the Supreme Court upheld the decision of the High Court in May 2013. The organisation also filed PILs against the government to stop projects such as the Chennai-Salem Expressway and Neutrino Observatory. It opposed the extraction of hydrocarbon in Neduvasal.  Festivals  Every year, the organisation conducts a day-long conference with a millet food festival. In 2012, it conducted Aindhinai Vizha (festival of five landscape), where scholars spoke about the present environmental impact on the Sangam landscape. In 2013, Muneer Vizhavu (festival of water) talked about conservation of water. In 2014, Aimbootham Vizha (festival of five elements) celebrated classical elements as mentioned in the Sangam literature. In 2015, the Pozhuthugal Aaru (six seasons) conference talked about the six seasons in the Tamil calendar.

It has a single hairy leaf and usually only one creamy-yellow flower with red streaks, the flower on a hairy stalk. Description Caladenia australis is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single hairy leaf, long and wide. There is usually only a single flower on a thin, wiry, sparsely hairy spike high, each flower wide. The dorsal sepal curves forward or droops over the rest of the flower. All three sepals are long, wide and taper to a thin end with dark red, club-like glands. The petals are a similar size and shape to the sepals but lack glandular ends. The petal and sepals spread widely, sometimes drooping near their ends and are a creamy-yellow colour, often with red streaks. The labellum is shiny, yellowish with a maroon tip and curves forward, with the tip rolled under at the end. It is egg-shaped, long and about wide. The edges of the labellum have many teeth up to long and there are 4 to 6 rows of dark red calli along the labellum mid-line, decreasing in size towards the front. Flowering occurs between September and November and is strongly enhanced by fires the previous summer. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Geoffrey Carr in 1991 and the description was published in Indigenous Flora and Fauna Association Miscellaneous Paper 1. The type specimen was collected on Wilsons Promontory. The specific epithet (australis) is a Latin word meaning \\"southern\\". Distribution and habitat Caladenia australis mostly grows in near-coastal areas of Victoria and although widespread, is also uncommon. It grows in heath and woodland, usually on sandy soil. There is a single record from the southern part of Flinders Island in 1968. Conservation There are insufficient data to make an assessment of the conservation status of southern spider orchid in Victoria but it is listed as \\"Endangered\\" under the Tasmanian \\"Threatened Species Protection Act 1995\\".

It was released on 17 May 2005 through Season of Mist record label. Musical style Like Kill the Thrill's overall sound, Tellurique draws influences from various genres, including heavy metal, new wave, ambient goth, alternative rock and industrial music. Featuring frontman Nicolas Dick's occasionally low and effect-laden deadpan vocals, the album consists of \\"down- tempo, brooding, lyric-driven songs\\" and atmospheric compositions typical of progressive rock and space rock styles. In terms of atmosphere and compositions, the tracks on the album were compared to the works of Killing Joke, Joy Division, Nine Inch Nails, Isis and Voivod. Critical reception Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic praised the album's eclectic style, describing it as \\"too sparse for metal, too morbid for new wave, too humanized for industrial, and definitely too alternative for alternative rock.\\" Neverthe≈üless, Rivadavia further added that the record's \\"strange creative pathways may prove too broad, or too vague, to make a connection with their limited tastes of the fans of the other different musical styles, co-signing the French trio to once again appeal to just a very small and selective, but open-minded, fan base.\\" Exclaim! magazine critic Monica S.

At first, a Lake Minchin was identified with ages of 30,000 years or older; later additional lake cycles were recognized. The minor ones include Inca Huasi, Salinas and Coipasa. The major ones include Lake Tauca and Ouki. Because of this, it was proposed that Lake Minchin was actually a combination of several different ancient lakes. This lake occupied the area of the current Salar de Uyuni; it also covered the Salar de Coipasa but it is not clear whether and how it extended in the Lake Poopo. Its waters reached altitudes of and its depth did not exceed . A sample dated 23,700 ¬± 2,600 years ago by uranium-thorium dating indicates that lake levels at that point were about deep in the Uyuni basin. Water levels subsequently decreased to less than above the present day levels before Lake Tauca formed, however both the timing and the history of water levels are uncertain. The surface area of the lake may have been during the highstand. By 19,900 ¬± 900 - 18,700 ¬± 200 years ago, the Lake Tauca was beginning to form. The so-called \\"L2\\" unit in drill cores in Salar de Uyuni may correspond to both the Sajsi and the later Lake Tauca cycle. isotope data indicate that about 41% of the water in Sajsi came from Lake Poopo and 4% from Lake Titicaca. Radiocarbon dates have been obtained for Sajsi-age ooids and tufa, uncalibrated they range from 17,080 ¬± 720 to 20,830 ¬± 140 years ago. Later dates indicated that the lake existed between 25,000 and 19,000 years ago and reached its maximum depth 23,000 years ago. The existence of this lake coincides with the Last Glacial Maximum. Earlier, lakes had formed in the Laguna Blanca, the Salar de Atacama, as well as the Pozuelos Basin in northwest Argentina. Given evidence from the Bolivian Eastern Cordillera and the small size of the glacial Sajsi and Inca Huasi paleolakes, it is likely that the Last Glacial Maximum was accompanied by a dry climate on the Altiplano and indeed climate modelling shows that only a small precipitation increase - or none at all - would be needed to create the Sajsi lake. Glacier expansion is recorded at that time in Northwest Argentina. The second Heinrich event seems to coincide with the Sajsi lake period. A maximum in local insolation about 21,000 years ago coincides with the existence of the Sajsi lake but was probably not responsible for the lake's existence. Farther south, precipitation in the drainage area of the Rio Salado had increased by during the Sajsi time, lakes formed within the Western Cordillera and the Bolivian Chaco likewise shows evidence of increased precipitation. The Sajsi lake was apparently followed by Lake Tauca, but evidence is lacking. Another theory postulates that Sajsi was simply a sub-phase of Lake Tauca, an interpretation applied in particular to data taken from drill cores.

It has rough, tessellated bark on the trunk and larger branches, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, creamy white flowers with a red centre, and urn-shaped to barrel-shaped fruit. Description Corymbia rhodops is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has red-brown to grey-brown tessellated bark on the trunk and larger branches. Branches thinner than about are smooth- barked. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves that are glossy green above, paler below, elliptical to lance-shaped, long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, glossy green but paler on the lower surface, lance- shaped, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flowers are borne on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with seven buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are pear-shaped to oval, long and wide with a conical to rounded operculum with a small point in the centre. Flowering occurs from December to February and the flowers have creamy white stamens with a red centre. The fruit is a woody urn-shaped to barrel-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed in the fruit. Taxonomy and naming The red-throated bloodwood was first formally described in 1987 by Denis John Carr and Stella Grace Maisie Carr who gave it the name Eucalyptus rhodops and published the description in their book Eucalyptus II - The rubber cuticle, and other studies of the Corymbosae. They collected the type specimens near Watsonville in 1975. In 1995, Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson changed the name to Corymbia rhodops, publishing the change in the journal Telopea. Distribution and habitat This bloodwood is only known form a few small population on steep slopes on the western side of the Atherton Tableland and on the Windsor Tablelands. Conservation status Corymbia rhodops was listed as vulnerable under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 in 2008. The plant has a limited range but the main identified threat to the tree is the destruction of habitat due to mining activity.

While this is often seen as a common reality in regions such as Asia with its many religions, religious scholars have begun to discuss multiple religion belonging with respect to religious traditions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Those who practice double belonging claim to be an adherent of two different religions at the same time or incorporate the practices of another religion into their own faith life. It is increasing with globalisation. One such example is a person attending a Christian church but also engaging in the Hindu practice of yoga. Context In some religions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, those who hold to an exclusivist understanding of religion see multiple religious belonging as problematic. This is in contrast with countries such as China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka, whose cultures have a long history of being influenced by different religions. Moreover, in the postmodern period people tend to question their identity, because of the unlimited choices of religions, which leads to the difficulty in defining their identity. Van Bragt showed that 79% of Japanese self-identify as Shintoists and 75% self-identify as Buddhists. The reason for the extremely high percentage of both religions is that many Japanese consider themselves as both a Shintoist and a Buddhist and do not consider it a problem to belong to more than one religion. (Whether this statistic is correct is arguable.) This phenomenon, according to Van Bragt, is a \\"division of labour\\". Van Bragt argued that the cause of this phenomenon is that, different from the Western concept of religion, Shintoism and Buddhism in Japan are defined by their rituals and practices, not by their moral and social authority. Thus, the Japanese can belong to several religions that do not conflict with each other in terms of social and ethical issues. Scholars such as Catherine Cornille, Peter C. Phan, Francis Xavier Clooney, Jan Van Bragt, Aloysius Pieris and Devaka Premawardhana have questioned the possibility of defining oneself into multiple religions. For these scholars, \\"religious belonging\\" is not an individual's subjective sense of a particular religion but rather, in Cornille's words, \\"the recognition of one's religious identity by the tradition itself and the disposition to submit to the conditions for membership as delineated by that tradition.\\" For Cornille, the ultimate purpose of a scholarly discussion on multiple religious belonging is to transform one's religion through the understanding of other religions.  Types of approaches  Based on Van Bragt's study, scholars have tried to investigate the possibility for adherents of a religion such as Christianity to belong to multiple religions. The approach to Christian multiple religious belonging, according to Devaka Premawardhana, can be divided into two trends: Peter Phan's approach based on a Christological ground, in which he emphasises on Christ's \\"asymmetrically superior status\\", and Francis Clooney's approach rooted in a methodological ground, which tries to cross boundaries into another religion just as religions must have discrete entities. These two approaches are summarised below. = Christological approach = Phan's approach emphasised the assymmetricality in which Jesus is the Logos made flesh and the climax of God dealing with humankind. In an attempt to resonate with one's cultural identity and tradition, Phan explained that multiple religious belonging is necessary in order for practitioners of multiple belonging to treat other religions as a qualifier of their identity. This approach, according to Phan, does not deny one's Christian identity, which functions as substantive in relation to non-Christian religion. Phan noted that multiple religious belonging is not a new issue in the twenty-first century but rather the common form of life of the first-century Christians recorded in the book of Acts. In Phan's view, the disappearance of this trend was \\"a tragic loss to both Judaism and Christianity\\", because it led to a subsequent history of bitter hatred, especially from the side of Christianity. = Methodological approach = As a comparative theologian, Clooney writes about the diversity in the world nowadays, especially with respect to the flourishing of different religions. For Clooney, reflecting on one's religion in this pluralistic world is necessary, so that we can \\"see the others in light of our own, and our own in light of the other.\\" Focusing on the study of scriptural and theological texts, Clooney compares them between Christian traditions and non-Christian religions, to \\"cross boundaries\\" to other traditions, so that one would re-think their own theology, which would thus shape their identity. After more than 40 years of studying Hinduism, Clooney concluded that he finds the distinctive disciplines of theology and Hinduism are \\"mutually enriching\\". By applying this approach, according to Clooney, one can start within his or her \\"home\\" tradition, enter a different tradition and return to his or her tradition, which is enriched and reformulated after crossing boundaries.  Challenges and controversy  While scholars studying multiple religious belonging attempt to appreciate other religions' traditions besides their own, the conservative segment of Christianity tends to question the inclusivistic view of multiple religious belonging because it implies that salvation can be found from somewhere else other than Jesus Christ. In a 2010 article, Veli-Matti K√§rkk√§inen, a systematic theologian, questioned the approach of \\"othering\\" those that have traditions different from Christians' because God is the one who offers salvation; Christians only witness it. It is out of humility that Christians can say that salvation belongs to God, and God only, in K√§rkk√§inen's view. On the other hand, scholars studying multiple religious belonging such as John B. Cobb see this as an opportunity rather than a threat: \\"I do not see multiple religious belonging as the primary way into the future. The primary way is the transformation of the particular religious traditions, at least in the Christian case, through their new encounter with other traditions.\\" For Cobb, engaging in interfaith dialogue helps smooth the tension between Christianity and Judaism and avoid misunderstanding toward Islam. In a 2017 article, sociologist Steve Bruce pointed out that most of the published writings in which multiple religious belonging is studied are purely conceptual and offer \\"only anecdotes to illustrate theoretical or classificatory discussions\\". Bruce argued that the few attempts to gather empirical data on the phenomenon have conflated a variety of different attitudes that should not be given the label of \\"multiple religious belonging\\", attitudes such as: universalistic re-interpretation of multiple religions, multiple religious association through family ties, multiple religious interest or sympathies, ancillary religious respect for a specific aspect of a religion, and secular equal respect for all religions. Bruce argued that the term \\"multiple religious belonging\\" should be strictly confined to being \\"an observant 'member' of more than one religion (religion here meaning such high level abstractions as Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism etc)\\", and since most religions have strict requirements for and expectations of observant members, sociologists should expect multiple religious belonging, defined in this way, to be \\"remarkably rare\\".

He is the co-founder of cyber-security companies Check Point and Imperva, as well as Cato Networks, a cloud-based network security provider. Personal life Shlomo Kramer has been actively involved with technology all his life. As a youth, he worked on mainframes and sold video games. He landed his first job ‚Äì selling personal computers at a Tel Aviv shop ‚Äì at age 15. After discovering that one of the shop's best-selling games was developed and marketed by a 17-year-old in Britain who had set up his own company, Kramer knew that he \\"wanted to be like him ‚Äì an entrepreneur, even though it would be quite a few years before I knew the word.\\" Kramer served in the Israel Defense Forces‚Äô Unit 8200, a crack cybersecurity and intelligence team whose operations include gathering, analyzing and decrypting data; over the years, the unit has produced many of Israel‚Äôs top high-tech entrepreneurs. After completing his military service, Kramer earned a master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from Tel Aviv University. Career Kramer, who has been called \\"the godfather of Israeli cybersecurity,\\" is a serial high-tech investor and entrepreneur with \\"a long track record of success\\". In 1993, he co-founded Check Point Software Technologies along with Gil Shwed and Marius Nacht; the company introduced the first firewall to the commercial market and went on to become \\"a world leader in protecting the information that flows round the Internet, and a flagship of Israel's high-tech industry\\". Kramer left Check Point in 1998 and used the money from the sale of his stake to strike out on his own as an entrepreneur and investor in numerous startups. In 2002, Kramer founded his second startup, Imperva, together with Mickey Boodaei and Amichai Shulman. Imperva moved away from perimeter defenses such as firewalls and instead deployed its software to protect against hackers and business-data theft by identifying and preventing attacks before they find their way to the inside of an organization. The company's initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange raised $90 million, with its shares gaining 33% on its first day of trading on 9 November 2011. In 2014, Imperva acquired Skyfence, a cloud security gateway startup in which Kramer was a lead investor, and bought the shares it did not already own in Incapsula, a cloud- based website performance and security service in which it had already invested. The acquisitions helped Imperva extend its data security strategy throughout the cloud. Kramer's belief in the cloud as the next big development in cybersecurity led him to establish Cato Networks in 2016, together with former Imperva colleague Gur Shatz. Cato Networks‚Äô software integrates all the elements of an organization's network ‚Äì including branch locations, data centers, mobile users and more ‚Äì into one encrypted network in the cloud. This means the enterprise is no longer tied to an array of location-bound appliances to protect its data. Investments In addition to co-founding Check Point, Imperva and Cato Networks, Kramer has invested in many startups, mostly in the field of data security. A partial list of his investments since 2000 includes: Insert; SafeBreach; LightCyber; TopSpin Security; Exabeam; Fundbox; Splacer; Comilion; Lacoon Mobile Security; Alicanto ; WatchDox ; Sumo Logic; Worklight; Trusteer; Business Layers, Aqua Security and Indegy. Awards and honors In 2006, Kramer was selected by Network World magazine as one of 20 luminaries who changed the network industry. In 2008, he was named CEO of the Year by SC Magazine. In 2013, Kramer was inducted into the Infosecurity Europe Hall of Fame. Other Interests Based in Israel, Kramer enjoys deep-sea diving and photography. He was a weightlifting champion in his youth.

John Mallon had a major influence on the French school of paleography, introducing and demonstrating the importance of the ductus as dynamic element of the evolution of writings. In the early years of his work, from 1937 to 1939, he retained the traditional theory that wanted all Roman writings were from the capital calligraphy by a regularly continuous transformation processing thereof, but highlighted the problems that this theory raised. He innovated by creating the first palaeographic movie, La lettre, which highlighted the role of successive actions of cursiveness and calligraphy on the morphological transformation of the alphabet. He published, with Robert Marichal, L'√©criture latine de la capitale romaine √† la minuscule. After the war, Mallon was the project manager of the \\"nouvelle pal√©ographie\\" (new paleography) and published in 1952 the work Pal√©ographie romaine, which organized new concepts of the evolution of writing in a consistent and flawless presentation: the inclination of the support moves the thick and thin strokes and generates a genealogy of various scriptures attested in Roman times that can no longer be seen as a continuous multiple affiliations, but in a pattern that, in outline, must be at least bifurcated.

The active geological processes of Borneo are mild as all of the volcanoes are extinct. The geological forces shaping SE Asia today are from three plate boundaries: the collisional zone in Sulawesi southeast of Borneo, the Java-Sumatra subduction boundary and the India-Eurasia continental collision. Early amalgamation from Gondwana This map of Borneo has the provenance of the crustal blocks marked using colours. Blue and orange represent crustal blocks rifted from Gondwana at different times. Green is the Luconia and Dangerous Grounds continental crust. Purple records past Suture zones where crustal margins came together. The SE Asia region is made up of fragments of crust that drifted northwards after being separated from Gondwana. These continental fragments make up the basement that formed prior to the magmatic activity and ophiolite emplacement. Gondwana was a large continent that once extended over the south pole during the Paleozoic times. Some of these crustal fragments form Sundaland, the region of the continental core of SE Asia. Sundaland is surrounded by the South China and India continental blocks to the north and Australia to the south. Fragments of Gondwana that reached as far north as Eurasia include Thailand and peninsular Malaysia. Other fragments that did not reach so far north form southwest Borneo's Schwaner Mountains in Kalimantan, and also Sumatra and Java. The rifting, migrating northwards and accretion to form Sundaland took place during the Late Paleozoic and Early Mesozoic in three stages. The stages were controlled by the opening and closing of the Tethys Ocean separating Gondwana from Eurasia. Gondwana was in the south and Eurasia migrated north to its current location where it is relatively fixed today. These stages were during the Devonian, Late Permian and Late Triassic. In addition to a basement of crustal fragments rifted from Gondwana, SE Asia is also characterised by: * Mesozoic ophiolite emplacement across much of SE Asia due to the subduction of the Palaeo-Pacific plate. * A prolonged period of magmatism across much of SE Asia that formed extrusions and intrusions into the basement ophiolites and crustal blocks. * Sedimentation that dominated through the Late Mesozoic across the region following the end of the subduction. * Cenozoic extension and Rifting of the South China Sea to the north of Borneo during the Eocene where multiple models have been suggested to accommodate this spreading. Mesozoic subduction During the Jurassic and Cretaceous time periods there was extensive volcanism and intrusions caused by the subduction of an oceanic plate. The western Pacific plate was subducted beneath SE China and SE Asia. The initiation of this subduction caused ophiolites to be emplaced and the development of the Pacific arc, a magmatic belt across SE Asia. Ophiolites are large blocks of oceanic crust that have been thrust onto continental crust due to compression that forms subduction type collisional plate boundaries. The early Pacific arc is a curved line of volcanism and intrusions where the Palaeo-Pacific Ocean subducted beneath Borneo, Vietnam and South China. The resulting long period of magmatism is evident from intrusions and extrusions reaching as far north as South China, through Hong Kong, the South China Sea continental shelf, Vietnam and to Kalimantan in southwest Borneo. This period of magmatism continued until 79Ma, when the margin moved east. The ages of magmatism in these locations are 186 Ma to 76 Ma for the Schwaner Mountains granites of Kalimantan; at 180 Ma to 79 Ma in South China; at 165 Ma to 140 Ma in Hong Kong and at 112 Ma to 88 Ma in Dalat in Vietnam. The magmatic belt of arc granites and volcanism across SE Asia produced by this subduction was hundreds of kilometres wide, with a total area of 220,000 km2.  Ophiolite emplacement  thumbrightBlack outline shows Borneo with colours overlying that represent presence of ophiolites in blue, cretaceous granites in red, Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic sedimentation in yellow, and pink fill indicates Late Cenozoic magmatism. The Geological Time Scale bar on the right indicates the order of events and approximate timings. 440x440px There are many crustal fragments in northeast Borneo that are derived from Mesozoic ophiolites placed during the initiation of the western Pacific Ocean plate subducting beneath southeast China and southeast Asia. This ophiolite basement underlies regions from Sabah in northeast Borneo and the Meratus Mountains in southeast Borneo. The ophiolite crustal fragments were also emplaced in Central Java to the south of Borneo and Palawan and the Philippines in the North. An ophiolite is a sequence of oceanic lithosphere that has been thrust on top of continental lithosphere and therefore has peridotites, gabbros and basaltic units overlain by cherts and submarine volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Ophiolites originate as oceanic crust, they are ultramafic or mafic in composition and have a high concentration of pyroxene and amphibole minerals. Surface exposures of the ophiolite basement can be seen in the Segama Valley, Darvel Bay, Telupid and Kudat. K-Ar dating of the ophiolites has indicated that they are Cretaceous in age supporting subduction beneath Borneo at this time. Late Cretaceous ‚Äì Cenozoic sedimentation Sedimentation took place after the ophiolite emplacement and magmatism of the South China Sea related to the Mesozoic western Pacific subduction. The sedimentation shows transition from deep marine mudstones and turbidites in the Paleogene to shallow marine sandstones, deltaic fluvial and carbonates during the Miocene and into the Pliocene. This gives evidence supporting changes to the environmental setting that occurred due to rifting, uplift and sedimentation events. The Rajang Group and Kinabatangan Group are characterised by the deep marine sediments while the Serudong Group is made up of sediments deposited in a shallower marine environment. A prolonged period of extension of the South China Sea took place during the Late Cretaceous to Miocene. The cause of the northwest-southeast spreading of the South China Sea is not yet defined however there are various potential models that represent different kinematic processes. Looking at the sedimentary record can help constrain this period of extension and its causes. An account of the late Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentation follows. =Rajang Group= Sedimentation took place predominantly during the Early Tertiary in the Crocker Basin which is found today in the northwest of Borneo and off the present-day coast. Deep marine turbidites and mudstones known as the Rajang Group were deposited. Deposition is thought to coincide in time with when India began colliding with Asia. Within the Rajang Group sedimentary record, the end of the South China Sea spreading is recorded showing a transition from active continental margin in the Late Cretaceous to a deep marine setting through the Tertiary. The Rajang Group has subsequently undergone strong deformation and been uplifted to its current 1 km elevation to form the Interior Highlands of Borneo. =Kinabatangan Group= In the Late Eocene, above the Rajang Group, there is a period of no deposition, marking the tectonic uplift event of the Sarawak Orogeny. This period of time with no deposition is called an unconformity and appears as a gap in time in the sedimentary record. Following this, Oligocene deposition of the Kinabatangan Group occurred, which also consisted of turbidites and marine mudstones. Turbidites and mudstones are indicative of a deep marine environment due to the low energy in deep oceans which forms the fine grained mudstones with occasional submarine landslide type events forming turbidites. The Crocker Fan, that makes up part of the Kinabatangan Group, has vast volumes of Paleogene deep marine sediment. The timing of this depositional period is not constrained but evidence from recent research favours its correlation to Late Eocene. The Crocker Fan has the largest volume of any Paleogene deep marine sediment in a single basin in southeast Asia. =Serudong Group= The Miocene uplift in Sabah began to change sedimentary deposits from deep marine turbidites and cherts to shallowing coastal marine sediments during the Miocene and into the Pliocene. The shallowing succession saw deposition of carbonates and shows a transition from marine to deltaic fluvial deposits which together form the Serudong Group. This represents shallowing of the environment as deltas are coastal features found where a river meets the sea. Early Miocene sedimentation is seen in basins to the east and northeast of Borneo. The newfound space for sediments to accumulate was introduced by Eocene rifting. Erosional material sourced from the Borneo highlands along with other older parts of the basin margins being uplifted . Cenozoic magmatism mentioned below that caused intrusions such as at Mt. Kinabalu could be potentially related to this regional uplift. Cenozoic South China Sea extension Northeast Borneo's Cenozoic tectonics are still in hot debate, where there are three models explaining the crustal extension in the north of Borneo. The Proto-South China Sea plate previously lay to the east of today's Dangerous Grounds off the coast of Sabah, northwest Borneo. The Dangerous Grounds is a crustal block that forms part of the South China Sea and lies to the northwest of Borneo gaining its name by sailor's description of the shoals and reefs scattered ground. It is a basement of continental crust and forms the continental shelf of the South China Sea to the northwest of Sabah. The spreading of the South China Sea is no longer active. During the Eocene, extension of the Dangerous Grounds began, followed by further extension during the Oligocene. This extension across the South China Sea was in the northwest-southeast direction and caused thinning and rifting. This led to the formation of the South China Sea basin to the northwest of the Mesozoic arc that once extended across much of SE Asia. The extension that occurred formed a triangle-shaped rift area due to the kinematics of the rifting taking place like the blades of an opening pair of scissors. The three competing models mentioned above describe this rifting and thinning during the Late Mesozoic and vary slightly between different authors. Here, the three models are illustrated as: # The extrusion model where lateral strike slip faults are projected through the South China Sea and lateral displacement caused by the India-Asia collision forces the extension # The Subduction Model which coincides well with evidence on the formation of the Dangerous Grounds where slab pull caused extension as the Proto-South China Sea was subducted beneath NW Borneo # The continental rift basin model where distant processes of slab roll back south of Borneo near Java and Sumatra caused magmatism leading to the crustal extension northwest of Borneo and formation of A-type granites. =Extrusion model= 1) The Extrusion Model of the spreading of the South China Sea. Strike-Slip faults from the lateral movement of crust cause the spreading and clockwise rotation of Borneo. The lateral movement is caused by India's collision with Eurasia. Borneo is marked in red on the diagram. The spreading of the South China Sea is marked in Blue. The extrusion model links the India-Asia collision to the extension of the South China Sea. The collision would cause the lateral extension of strike slip faults in the South China Sea. This is where crust is squeezed out to the sides as India barges north into the Eurasia continent. The northward movement of India pushes the southeast Asia block away from the collision resulting in the clockwise rotation of Borneo forming a large extensional basin. In defining whether this model is correct it is important to understand if the strike slip faults of south China extend through the South China Sea as far as Borneo. Three major faults are known to traverse Indochina and South China are the Three Pagodas, Mae Ping and the Red River Fault, but not where they continue off the coast. It is not confirmed how far they cut into the South China Sea. The West Baram fault runs northwest-southeast off the coast of Sarawak, Borneo and separates blocks of differing geological histories, one of which is the Dangerous Grounds to the northeast. This fault is important as the slip is thought to accommodate proposed subduction of the proto South China Sea. Therefore, the amount of displacement along the strike-slip faults in Borneo are key to understand which model is correct. Along the West Baram fault there is not extensive displacement, indicating very little passage of the proto-South China Sea and possibly no subduction. However these models cannot conclude that the lack of lateral displacement demonstrates that the Extrusion Model must be false. A narrow proto-South China Sea or other crustal deformation could potentially have accommodated the subducting proto South China Sea and account for the lack of displacement along strike-slip faults.The continental rift basin model where the line with triangles represents subduction. Subduction to the south of Borneo pulls the plate that Borneo is on causing extension in the South China sea to the north. =Continental Rift Basin model= One of the three models for the thinning and rifting of the continental crust of the South China Sea is initiated by Java and Sumatra subduction causing extrusion and slab roll back along the margin. The stresses from these were experienced in the South China Sea and together they caused the southward extension of the South China Sea. This model indicates subduction to the south of Borneo near Java and Sumatra but not subduction of Borneo or beneath Borneo. This is unlikely to have caused South China Sea spreading singlehandedly but probably contributed to the forces involved. =Subduction model= 3) Subduction Model for subduction of the South China Sea in the Cainozoic. The subduction zone is represented by the line with black triangles. The photo South China Sea moves southwest and subducts beneath northwest Borneo. The proto-South China Sea plate is green on the diagram and Borneo is red. The spreading South China Sea is blue. An outline of Indochina and South China is visible in the northwest of the diagram. The subduction model proposes that the proto-South China Sea formed a subduction zone to its east, which subsequently, by the process of slab pull, subducted the proto-South China Sea beneath northwest Borneo. When the Dangerous Grounds collided with the Mesozoic granites of the Schwaner Mountains in Borneo, it brought an end to the subduction. This is due to the less dense Dangerous Grounds not having a big enough density contrast compared to the overlying plate. Therefore, with the end to subduction a suture was formed where the proto-South China Sea ceased subduction and the crustal margins came together. The proposed suture lies beneath Mount Kinabalu in northeast Borneo. The subduction zone is generally thought to be about 400 km to the northwest of the suture. This subduction period took place throughout the Eocene and ended in the Early Miocene. Late Ceneozoic Magmatism and the Mount Kinabalu intrusion Dating and defining the history of the Mount Kinabalu granitic intrusion faces many challenges due to the high erosion, difficult access through relief and rainforests, difficult to define boundaries and alteration. The general geology of southeast Asia during the Cenozoic is not well defined making the reconstruction of geological events leading to Borneo's current setting an interesting point of study. Mount Kinabalu is in Sabah, northeast Borneo and is 4095 m high. It was intruded at the same time as other Late Cenozoic magmatism that occurred in the South China Sea. The Mount Kinabalu intrusion is a laccolith where intrusion of magma pushes up into the stratigraphy. The sediments in the overlying stratigraphy have been deformed as a result of this pluton style intrusion. The Mount Kinabalu intrusion is a laccolith style pluton that caused the deformation of sediments overlying the intrusion. It intruded between 7.85Ma and 7.22Ma into shallow depths of less than 12 km splitting the overlying sediments from the underlying ultramafic basement rocks. Other magmatism in Borneo during the Late Cenozoic include intrusive and extrusive in Sarawak, the Semporna Volcanics of Eastern Sabah and in Kalimantan.

The police gave chase, Shaih was shot and killed while shooting at pursuing police. Attack The gunman attacked the Ammunition Hill Jerusalem Light Rail station in East Jerusalem, located near the national police headquarters, in a drive-by shooting. Police on motorcycles gave chase as the gunman fled to the nearby predominately Arab Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood where he shot and wounded two police officers and was subsequently killed in a shootout with police. =Background= The attack took place at a time when terrorist attacks had declined and casualties were rare since the few recent attacks had been planned by untrained \\"Lone wolves,\\" who planned poorly and were not heavily armed with guns or explosives. The attack was unusual because strict gun control makes it rare for non-security personnel to have access to guns. Most Terrorist attacks on Israelis in 2015/16 were stabbing attacks or vehicle ramming attacks, making this the deadliest attack on Israelis since the June 2016 Tel Aviv shooting. Attacker The gunman, Musbah Abu Sbaih, (alt. Mesbah Abu Sbaih), (39) was a member of Hamas. was a resident of the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan. He had a long police record, with Yossi Melman remarking that Sbaih had a \\"record of involvement in provocations regarding the Temple Mount, incitement, friction with security forces, and serving a year in prison\\" On the day of the shooting, the Sbaih was due to begin serving a four-month prison sentence for assaulting a police officer in 2013. According to a Hamas statement following the attack, Abu Sbaih was due to serve a 4-month term of \\"administrative detention,\\" but, \\"Instead of handing himself over, he chose the best way of the holy warriors, to carry out a heroic attack.\\" Hamas claimed credit for the killings, and described Sbaih as a man known as the \\"Lion of Al Aqsa.\\" Response =Israeli response= Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan blamed the attacks on the fact that, \\"Incitement is plentiful, and it drives people to commit terror attacks.\\" He stated that Facebook and other social media companies are, \\"directly responsible for what's happening.\\" Callin it, \\"Scandalous that Facebook reopened Hamas' pages last week in the wake of pressure from the Palestinian street.\\" Security measures and arrests Israeli police closed the pastry shop belonging to the gunman's family on October 11, describing the shop as a \\"center for incitement,\\" where videos that \\"encourage terrorism\\" were filmed. The family of the killer had celebrated the event by passing out candy to passersby and visitors after the shootings. Israeli police closed a printing shop in the town of A-Ram that had been publishing posters in praise of the perpetrator, including some posted at his family home. Printing equipment and the stock of incitement posters were seized. The day after the attack, the perpetrator's 17-year-old daughter, Eiman, posted a video of herself on Facebook in which she said, \\"We deem my father as martyr. ... I am proud of what my father did. ... We're very happy and proud of our father. ... My father is a great man.\\" She was arrested and detained for 5 days, then released after paying a fine. She is required to stay out of Jerusalem for 2 months, not post on social media, and not give any media interviews for an unstipulated amount of time. =Palestinian responses= Players for West Bank Premier League soccer team Hilal Al-Quds Club in East Jerusalem had their photo taken under a banner celebrating the gunman as \\"martyr\\" and a \\"hero.\\" However, a team spokesman told the Associated Press that the image would be removed from social media sites because it violates FIFA rules. Published photos show supporters of Hamas handing out Baklava and candy in celebration of the \\"martyrdom\\" of Abu Sbeih. Candy was also handed out in his honor in eastern Jerusalem. Fatah, the Party of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas praised the killer and proclaimed a day of mourning in the gunman's memory. The team's coach, 55-year-old Maher abu Snina, was arrested \\"on suspicion of incitement and support for terrorist activities against Jews.\\" On Eid al-Fitr, 2017, a Palestinian family distributed boxes of candy with an image of killer Musbah Abu Sbaih on the lid to Muslim worshipers on the Temple Mount. =Other responses= The Omani newspaper Alwatan described the shootings as, \\"a response to Israel's crimes\\". Lamis Deek, a member of the Board of Directors of the New York Council on American‚ÄìIslamic Relations, criticized those who describe the drive-by shooting as an \\"attack,\\" characterizing it instead as an example of a Palestinian Arab who was \\"resisting violence.\\" Analysis According to Avi Issacharoff this attack was promoted by Palestinian activists as a \\"template for future actions in the so-called 'Al-Quds Intifada.'\\" According to Amos Harel, since the attack was filmed by Palestinians, it is likely to generate copycat attacks. Yossi Melman discussed this attack in the context of the \\"weakening\\" authority of aging Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Chief of Israeli police Roni Alsheikh admitted in a press conference that he feared that the \\"success\\" of this murderer might embolden others to attack Israelis.

Early life Abadam was born in London in 1856 to Edward Ab Adam and his wife Louisa (n√©e Taylor). Her father was the eldest son of Edward Hamlin Adams, a Jamaican-born banker and merchant who made his money overseas before settling in Britain. In 1825 Edward Hamlin Adams bought Middleton Hall in Carmarthenshire following the death of its owner, Sir William Paxton. The Hall was passed down to his son Edward in 1842, who added the old Welsh patronym, Ab, to the family name. Abadam, by her own account, had a happy childhood and was educated by a governess at Middleton Hall. She was the youngest of seven children, and saw little of her mother who suffered ill- health brought about by post-natal depression. By 1861 her mother was living away from the family in Brighton, and in 1871 was living back at her paternal home in Dorset. Despite living apart, her parents remained married until the death of Edward in 1875. Her father was a High Sheriff of Carmarthenshire. He held anti-clerical views, but Abadam converted to Catholicism in 1880. A musical upbringing led her to becoming the organist and choir master at St Mary's Church on Union Street, in the centre of Carmarthen. Abadam met Dr. Alice Vowe Johnson, a social worker and they were companions for the rest of their lives. Work as a suffragette In 1905 Abadam joined the Central Society for Women's Suffrage. She became a well known speaker and she addressed a number of suffrage societies, including a two week speaking tour around Birmingham in 1908, and other areas in 'the North' often by bicycle and sketching her experiences. Women's Freedom League colours and motto 1908 Original in LSE Library Abadam had subscribed as an 'independent socialist' to the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) and Independent Labour Party manifesto in the 1906 elections, and in 1911, the WSPU newspaper Votes for Women called Abadam 'that well known speaker on social issues'. Abadam attended the Savoy dinner for the release of WSPU prisoners in 1906, but had moved away from the militant movement the following year. Abadam was one of the signatories (including Edith How Martyn, Charlotte Despard, Theresa Billington-Greig, Marion Coates-Hansen, Irene Miller, Bessie Drysdale, Maude Fitzherbert) to a letter to Emmeline Pankhurst explaining their disquiet on 14 September 1907, and establishing the alternative Women's Freedom League. Abadam then become president first of the Beckenham London Society for Women's Suffrage in 1908, then Norwood and District Women's Suffrage Society in 1913. Abadam, in 1911, spoke on 'How the Vote will affect the White Slave Traffic' to the Mansfield National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies, and in the same year when the Catholic Women's Suffrage Society formed, she urged Catholic women to move from local or small charitable works to make join suffrage campaigns to \\"influence the lives of millions of their poor and unprotected sisters for the good.\\" In Norwich in August 1912, speaking for an hour and quarter, Adadam appealed directly to the Catholic clergy not to abuse their power by promoting 'indifference and uninformed opposition' to women's suffrage, reported in The Tablet Catholic newsletter. Her outspokenness and open criticism of clergy, including Father Rev. Henry Day, who opposed votes for women, led to a label for Abadam as 'arrogant' and 'paranoid' and her followers were called 'Abadamites' in another Catholic publication, Universe. Alice Meynell wrote supportively in The Tablet, ' A Tribute to Miss Abadam'. And in Plymouth in 1913, she placed a motion at the Catholic Women's Suffrage Society, that this meeting 'calls upon the Government to extend the Parliamentary franchise to women in the interests of justice, morality and religion.' in a 1913 pamphlet, \\"The Feminist Vote, Enfranchised or Emancipated?‚Äù, Abadam wrote more generally on women's rights, that 'The Constructive Feminist has to be no man's shadow. She must be herself ‚Äì free to the very soul of sex servility. So, and only so, can she save a stricken world.' Abadam hosted a table including Evelina Haverfield and members of the Actresses' Franchise League and the Women Writer's Suffrage League at the Hotel Cecil costume dinner in 1914. Alice Abadam, suffragist, Middleton Hall Carmarthen By 1916, Abadam was chair of the Federated Council of Suffrage Councils. In 1920, Abadam founded the Feminist League with a wide debating agenda and lending library on topics related to feminism but also including freemasonry, embryology and witches. In the 1920s the Catholic Women's Suffrage Society (which had become the St. Joan's International Alliance) promoted the Equal Franchise Bill and celebrated its passing into law in 1928, with a Mass in Westminster Cathedral and a procession of Protestant and Catholic suffragists including Millicent Fawcett, Charlotte Despard, Virginia Crawford, Elisabeth Christitch and Leonara di Alberti and Alice Abadam (who was by then aged seventy-two).  Death and Legacy  Abadam was involved in supporting a Breton order of White Sister nuns escape persecution and settle in Wales. Abadam served on a committee for art at the University of Wales later in her life. She died in Abergwili in 1940 and left her money to her niece, Mary Edith Morris. Abadam also left an education legacy to pay for boarding school for her great niece Margaret Vaughan, who was four years old at her death. Vaughan said at the centenary of the some women getting the right to vote through the Representation of the People Act 1918, that her family's view of Abadam was ‚ÄúEverybody thought she was incredible clever and noble and she gave so much to feminism. I am immensely grateful to her for everything. I feel that she was my major benefactor. Everybody in our family admires her and I still have a collection of paintings of hers which I regularly get out to look at.‚Äù And her own daughter has a glass with 'Votes for Women' inscribed on it. Some of Abadam's own sketches are published on the website The Sybil. Abadam was recognised by the Women's Archive Wales as a feminist, suffragist, orator and author. A blue plaque at 26 Picton Terrace, Carmarthen, Abadam's home from 1886-1904 and at the National Botanical Garden of Wales Llanarthne on the site of her childhood home, the former Middleton Hall, was unveiled on 24 November 2018 by Abadam's great-niece Margaret Vaughan, who ensures that her family's memories of suffragist Alice Abadam lives on.

HgeTx1 is the first toxin (Tx1) from this scorpion (Hge). HgeTx1 belongs to the Œ±-KTx potassium channel toxin category, and is placed in the sixth subfamily of all Œ±-KTx toxins where HgeTx1 is the fourteenth member, which gives HgeTx1 its systematic name Œ±-KTx 6.14.  Chemical Structure  All Œ±-KTx category toxins are peptides that contain between 20 and 40 amino acids and contain three or four disulfide bridges. HgeTx1 consists of 36 amino acids and has four disulfide bridges. These disulfide bridges exist between Cys1‚ÄìCys5, Cys2‚ÄìCys6, Cys3‚ÄìCys7 and Cys4‚ÄìCys8. It has a molecular mass of 3950 atomic mass units.  Target  Electrophysiological experiments (whole cell configuration patch clamping) have been performed to investigate the physiological effect of HgeTx1 on Shaker B K+-channels in insect cell cultures. These recordings show that HgeTx1 reversibly blocks the Shaker B K+-channel. This blockage follows a Michaelis-Menten saturation relationship with a Kd of 52 nM. However, there is no report of selectivity for or blockage of other subtypes of K+-channels.  Mode of action  HgeTx1 has only been investigated for its effectiveness on the Shaker B K+-channel, where the toxin seems to work as a plug that blocks the pore's ion conductance. This blockage follows the functional dyad model that underlies most Œ±-KTx toxins. In the functional dyad model, a lysine residue interacts with a hydrophobic Leu, Tyr, Met or Phe residue, in order to recognize the K+-channel. On the extracellular side of the channel, the side-chain of the lysine residue will enter the pore and subsequently block the channel. In HgeTx1, it seems likely that the Lys24 residue will interact with the hydrophobic Met33 or Leu34 residue according to the functional dyad model, which allows it to block the Shaker B K+-channel.  Toxicity  Scorpions of the family Caraboctonidae, each of which produce a cocktail of different toxins, are not considered dangerous to humans.

Biography  Wife of the architect and urban planner Michele Valori, Valentina Tonelli graduated from Sapienza University in Rome with a degree in Pharmacy in 1963. With her choice of degree, she followed in the footsteps and traditions of her family, but in doing so she did not abandon her passion for writing, which she pursued through her research into testimonies and diaries. A descendant of the ancient Buffa di Perrero family, she edited various volumes of family memoirs. She expressed a similar commitment in her conservation of the artistic and intellectual work of Michele Valori, which she was able to collect and pass on to the rich archive acquired in 2007 by the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities for the collection of MAXXI Architecture. However, the story of the reassembling of Michele Valori's private archive actually began as early as 1980, as Tonelli realised the importance of acknowledging his indisputable skills with a complete collection. With perseverance and determination, she was able to recover all her husband's papers, both professional and academic, from across his studios and their home. In this way, she succeeded in reconstructing a body of documentary information of great value to the Italian architectural scene, and which was extremely significant in terms of the memories it encompassed and the affection it showed. In 1995, the archive of Michele Valori's projects and writings was declared of historical interest by the Archival Superintendency of Lazio, who described it as \\"a precious resource for the history of architecture and urbanism in Italy\\". It was thanks to the generous donation of Maria Valentina Tonelli and her daughters Giovanna, Paola and Francesca that MAXXI Architecture received the entire archive in 2007, catalogued and digitised in line with the archival standards of the Museum in order to facilitate consultation and promote historical research. Always committed to supporting and promoting cultural initiatives, putting it at the forefront of the sector alongside the great cultural and artistic institutions, in 2011 the museum founded the Michele Valori Association, which it will lead with tenacity and firmness, sensitivity and passion, until 2016. Maria Valentina Tonelli died from an incurable illness on 9 February 2016, leaving her daughter Paola to continue her work on the conservation of Michele Valori's memory, thought and works. As per her wishes, she is buried next to her husband in the family tomb in Monterotondo cemetery in Rome.  Published works  * In 1997, she published \\"Posta fatta in casa\\" (Gangemi Editore) * In 2011, she published \\"Virginia Buffa: storia di una donna delusa in amore nel sogno nascente della patria\\", a memoir of her great grandmother Virginia Buffa di Perrero, born in 1835 in Cairo Montenotte (Savona), joint testimony with her brother Gaspare Buffa (poet and philosopher, childhood friend of Cesare Abba) on the extraordinary event that was the Italian Risorgimento, Calosci publishers (Special prize at the national \\"Villa Morosini\\" competition, essays section (2011)). * In 2013, she published \\"Aldo Valori. Il fascista che non amava il regime \\", with a preface by Sergio Romano, published by Editori Riuniti. * In 2012, she produced the exhibition Michele Valori_Abitare le case at Ca' Zenobio degli Armeni for the Venice Biennale of Architecture. * In 2013, the same exhibition was presented in Rome at the MAXXI Architecture Archives Centre, where 35 new designs from the Torre Spagnola projects (Matera 1954) and the INA Casa Project (Civita Castellana 1950) were shown, alongside the forty original designs, photographs, models, archive video interviews and testimonies on the impact of his work. Maria Valentina Tonelli documented this exhibition with the publication of the volume \\"Architectural Notebooks\\", a collection of writings by her husband alongside testimonies, travel and visual notes from the years 1949 to 1979. A story in images followed by testimonies from those who knew and respected him, prominent figures such as Leonardo Benevolo, Masolino, D'Amico, Federico Gorio, Arnaldo Bruschi, Giulio Andreotti.

In a spin-gapless semiconductor, conduction and valence band edges touch, so that no threshold energy is required to move electrons from occupied (valence) states to empty (conduction) states. This gives spin-gapless semiconductors unique properties: namely that their band structures are extremely sensitive to external influences (e.g., pressure or magnetic field). Because very little energy is needed to excite electrons in an SGS, charge concentrations are very easily ‚Äòtuneable‚Äô. For example, this can be done by introducing a new element (doping) or by application of a magnetic or electric field (gating). A new type of SGS identified in 2017, known as Dirac-type linear spin-gapless semiconductors, has linear dispersion and is considered an ideal platform for massless and dissipationless spintronics because spin-orbital coupling opens a gap for the spin fully polarized conduction and valence band, and as a result, the interior of the sample becomes an insulator, however, an electrical current can flow without resistance at the sample edge. This effect, the quantum anomalous Hall effect has only previously been realised in magnetically doped topological insulators. As well as Dirac/linear SGSs, the other major category of SGS are parabolic spin gapless semiconductors. Electron mobility in such materials is two to four orders of magnitude higher than in classical semiconductors. SGSs are topologically non-trivial. Prediction and discovery The spin gapless semiconductor was first proposed as a new spintronics concept and a new class of candidate spintronic materials in 2008 in a paper by Xiaolin Wang of the University of Wollongong in Australia. Properties and applications The dependence of bandgap on spin direction leads to high carrier-spin- polarization, and offers promising spin-controlled electronic and magnetic properties for spintronics applications. The spin gapless semiconductor is a promising candidate material for spintronics because its charged particles can be fully spin-polarised, so that spin can be controlled via only a small applied external energy.

The Dukes, though they were not corporate-sponsored, were members of the amateur National Industrial Basketball League for two years, between 1952 and 1954. It was the time that the NBA was in its infancy.For the town of Santa Maria, a Golden Dukes home basketball game was an always community happening. They played their home games in the old Armory Building at the Santa Maria Fairpark on the corner of Stowell and Thornburg in Santa Maria. History =Duke Webster and AAU= Duke Webster, a Santa Maria individual who owned a service station caticorner from the Santa Maria Inn founded the team. He used to organize one campaign or another to keep the team afloat. For 4‚Äì5 years prior to the team joining the NIBL, Webster would sponsor the team, bringing in college players and becoming the Dukes' first coach. The Golden Dukes became champions of the Santa Maria City Basketball League in 1947-48, when Santa Maria was a small town back then and just about every adult who lived here went to a Dukes home game. The team soon grew popularity though its function was strictly amateur. \\"The Armory Building which hosted the Dukes' games always was packed.

The film is set in the 1939-1943 time frame and its central theme is Ukrainian anti-Polish hatred culminating in massacres of Poles in Volhynia. The screenplay was based on the collection of short stories titled Hate (Polish: Nienawi≈õƒá) by Stanis≈Çaw Srokowski. The film was nominated for the Golden Lions Award at the 41st Gdynia Film Festival, where it received three awards: for the cinematography, best d√©but, and best makeup.  Production  As the budget of the film was insufficient, the director appealed to the public for financial support in order to gather required funds to finish the film. Afterwards, the financial support was received from, for example, Telewizja Polska. Filming took place in: Lublin, Kolbuszowa, Kazimierz Dolny, Rawa Mazowiecka, Sanok and Skierniewice, from 19 September 2014 to 21 August 2015.  Plot  Cerkiew z GrƒÖziowej, some scenes to the movie were recorded in the Orthodox Church in 2014 The movie tells the story of young Polish girl, Zosia G≈Çowacka, from Volhynia's a village settled by Ukrainians, Poles and Jews. The story begins shortly before the outbreak of World War II in 1939 with the marriage of Zosia's sister to a Ukrainian. During the wedding, Zosia's father decides that she will marry an older village administrator, Maciej Skiba, despite her being deeply in love with a local, young Ukrainian boy, Petro. There is also resentment shown by the local Ukrainian population towards Polish officials, as they favor the Polish minority in Volhynia. In talks between the participants of the wedding, it is revealed that some Ukrainians carry out terrorist attacks against Polish authorities and Ukrainian collaborators, these attacks are met with severe actions from the Polish government, including closing Orthodox churches and the humiliation of the Ukrainian population. It is also shown that some parts of the Ukrainian and Polish populations try to reconcile with each other. When the war begins, Maciej is conscripted to the Polish Army to fight against the Germans in the September Campaign. When the campaign is lost, Maciej and other survivors try to return to their homes. On their way back, all members of the group, except Maciej, are captured by local Ukrainians, tortured and killed. Maciej manages to get to the village only by disguising himself as a Ukrainian. The village is in the eastern part of the Poland, which is occupied by the Soviet Union, and communist rule is established in the village. The local Ukrainian and Jewish populations co-operate with the Soviet authorities, replacing prewar Polish authorities as governors of the village. In the meantime, Zosia gets pregnant, most likely with Petro, but wants Maciej to believe that the child is his. As part of a massive deportation carried by the Soviets against the Poles in 1939‚Äì1941, Maciej, Zosia, and Maciej's children from his first marriage are about to be sent to Siberia or Kazakhstan as forced labour. Zosia and the children are rescued in last moment, just as the train is about to depart, Petro bribes the guard with vodka. When they come back to Petro's home, Zosia gets contractions. While she is giving birth to her child, the guard arrives and kills Petro. Zosia then takes care of Maciej's home and children during his absence. The children are sent to a school organized by the Soviets, where all children learn to inform against their parents and to give up on their religion. The plot then switches to 1941, when the German Army is conquering Volhynia during Operation Barbarossa. In the new situation, the same Ukrainians who welcomed the Soviets two years before now greet the Germans with vodka and bread. The Germans begin to kill local Jews and organize local police units from Ukrainian collaborators, who actively participate in the Holocaust of the Jews. However, people like Zosia and some Ukrainians still try to help the Jews by hiding them in safe places. In the meantime, Maciej comes back home after he managied to escape deportation. The family tries to organize its life in the changed reality, as the Poles face increased hostility from their Ukrainian neighbours, even more than at the beginning of the war. There are increasing murders of Poles by Ukrainians. In that situation, Maciej sets out to the local market despite Zosia's protests, who is afraid for his safety. She is proven right, as the other Polish neighbours arrive some days later with Maciej's head cut off by the Ukrainians. Zosia tries to get by as best she can while she takes care of the children. However, one day, she defends herself against an attempted rape by a Ukrainian policeman, and the presence of the Jews hidden by her is revealed. The Jews, an old couple and a young unrelated boy, escape and find shelter for the winter in the home of a local Ukrainian, who agrees to help after the Jew promises him a large amount of money. When the Jew's wife dies and winter comes, the Ukrainian demands the payment. When he asees that the Jew cannot pay him, he kills him in the forest. The young Jew is rescued by the Ukrainian's son, a friend. Finally, to the summer of 1943, news of the killings of Poles by Ukrainians spreads among the Poles in the village. At the time, a young Polish man who is seriously injured arrives at Zosia's home. When he recovers, he settles there as it makes Zosia feel safer. He contacts a local Home Army unit, which, by orders of the Polish government in the United Kingdom, does not protect the Poles from Ukrainian attacks but prepares to fight the Germans in the future. When Zosia's man is asked to be a guide for members of the Home Army on the way to a meeting with the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), Zosia desperately tries to discourage him from going. A fails however. When the two members of the Home Army arrive at the meeting, as agreed without weapons, they are surrounded by the UPA soldiers, captured, and then dismembered by horses. The men from the UPA then hunt for the rest of the Home Army group. They find only Zosia's friend, who has escaped and is hiding in a church that is full of Poles. During a sermon, the Ukrainians enter the church, killing everyone in the way, but Zosia's friend runs to the church's tower and somehow survives the attack. In the meantime, the local Ukrainian population, the former Ukrainian policeman and his friends join the UPA in the forest. They gather and call to eradicate the lands from Poles. There are two sermons from the Ukrainian Orthodox priests shown: one who preaches about loving neighbours and the one calling to kill all Poles to achieve pure Ukrainian lands at last and consecrateing the pitchforks, hammers and knives used by Ukrainians to murder their Polish neighbours. Soon, the first survivors of the pogroms arrive to the village and tell the story of Ukrainian neighbours killing Poles and everybody who does not want to participate in killings. The local Ukrainian village administrator arrives at Zosia's home to ensure her that she and her children stay at home, as they would not be harmed by their Ukrainian neighbours. Also, other Polish people are reassured for their safety. However, those are only deception tactics to allow Ukrainians to kill as many Poles as possible. Finally, the killings in the village begin at night. Zosia escapes with her child, but as she runs away, she sees Poles being tortured, including pregnant women being stabbed in womb, human bowels and eyes being taken out alive, people getting crucified alive on their doors and so on. Zosia's stepson is murdered during the massacre. Her stepdaughter, however, is rescued by a Ukrainian peasant. On her way to escape from certain death, Zosia arrives with her child to Petro's previous house, where she is rescued from death at the hands of Ukrainian mob, by Petro's mother. As Zosia runs away with her child from place to place, she encounters the corpses of mutilated Polish infants, women and elderly in every village. In one place, she runs into a unit of the German Army, which saves her from certain death, just moments before Ukrainians are about to kill her and her child. The Germans are astonished at first as to why she walks alongside them, but when they find more and more stacks of murdered Poles on their way, they feel sorry for her and escort her to the place where her sister, Helena, lives. She is welcomed there, as Vasyl, Helena's Ukrainian husband, is friendly to Poles. Zosia hides in their shed with her son. As most of the village's population is already involved in killings, Vasyl's brother tries to convince him to join the nationalists and to kill his Polish wife so that he can save himself and the children. As they wrangle, Vasyl kills his own brother with an axe. The next night, the whole family is attacked by Poles who seek revenge on Ukrainians. They condemn Helena for living with a Ukrainian, slaughter her newborn in front of her eyes and kill Vasyl and behead her. Zosia observes everything from the shed. Terrified, she escapes again and is now afraid of both Ukrainians and Poles. She hides in the woods with her son.

Jakub Majmurek wrote that Volhynia has met his high expectations and is one of the best movie describing the history of the \\"bleeding lands\\". The author also believes that the director of the movie, Smarzowski, presented the relations between Poles and Ukrainians honestly, and the notion of the movie is a warning against any form of radicalism. Ewa Siemaszko, who cooperates with the Institute of National Remembrance to uncover the historical facts of the massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia, thinks that the movie shows the events accurately. She quoted opinions of witnesses of the genocide, who said the movie is like a documentary on the events in Volhynia.

On the occasion of the premiere, Gnauck recalled the history of the region and the Polish-Ukrainian relations. The author cited expectations of some political experts that the movie may chill the relations, arouse negative emotions in Ukraine and be exploited by the Russians to unleash anti-Ukrainian propaganda. Gnauck has underlined the episode of Zosia and her child seeking shelter around a unit of the German Army. In Gnauck's opinion, the film is very good and balances the rights of both sides.Brutal und d√ºster: \\"Wolhynien\\" erz√§hlt vom Massaker an den Polen 1943, DW 2016-10-07 =In Ukraine= Following the recommendation of the Ukrainian ambassador to Poland, Andrii Deshchytsia, showing the film has been banned in Ukraine. Reportedly, the censorship was rationalized by the Ukrainian authorities, who alleged that the film \\"could cause unrest on the streets of Kiev\\". The head of the Ukrainian Association in Poland, Piotr Tyma, supported the ban by asserting that the film undermineed Polish-Ukrainian reconciliation efforts. The Ukrainian media accused the director of making a biased film \\"based only on Polish historical sources\\". The first such screening was planned by the Polish embassy in Kiev. It was to have been followed by a discussion with the director. Among the Ukrainian guests invited to attend was the president, prime minister and some MPs. However, Ukraine's foreign ministry strongly recommended foe the Polish embassy to call off the screening for the sake of \\"public order\\". Accordingly, the Polish Foreign Ministry spokesman Rafa≈Ç Sobczak said that the introductory screening had been cancelled. Talks might be held about a possible new date of limited viewing. The Polish Institute in Kiev followed the recommendation from Ukraine's foreign ministry and called off the presentation of a film set against the backdrop of World War II massacres. During the production of the film, some Ukrainian actors who were invited to play characters rejected the offer after reading about them because they thought that the film propagated hate. Nevertheless, the film received positive reception from Nadiya Savchenko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, who welcomeed the opportunity to talk about painful events of the past and noted many positive developments in today's Polish-Ukrainian relations.  Historical episodes  * The figure of officer in the Home Army arriving at the meeting with Ukrainians refers to the poet and officer Zygmunt Rumel, who was killed by the UPA ans tied to four horses, and his body was ripped apart. * The scene of attack on the church refers to events from 11 July 1943 in the village Kisielin (Kisielin massacre) called Bloody Sunday on Volhynia.

Biography  Mikhail Kotlyarov was born in 1963 in the city Azov, Rostov region. From his childhood he was passionate about music, practiced vocal. Studying in a secondary school, Michael has already soloed in the choir of the local pedagogical college. At the same time he was enrolled at the School of Music at the percussion department. Having shown his capabilities and diversified talent he became a musician in a symphonic orchestra. Being a member of this orchestra he participated in various city events. But singing was not his only passion. Inspired by a contemporary icon ‚Äì the legendary hockey player Kharlamov ‚Äì Mikhail spent all the time he could spare from music playing sports. Hockey became such an addiction for him that it became his childhood dream, making him wish to be a winner. ¬´Novoye vremia¬ª is a rock band created by Mikhail in the mid-70s. A fifteen year old teenager was overwhelmed by the creativity of western starts: the legendary Deep Purpose, Whitesnake, Black Sabbath. This could not avoid influencing the choice of music genre for his amateur band. The boys played hard rock and sothereafter in 1978 they received their first acknowledgement ‚Äì they won the 6th All-Union musical artists competition in Leningrad. A bit later Mikhail was offered to join a famous folk band ‚Äì ViA ¬´Rovesknik¬ª. With this band he took part in the opening of the sailing race of the Moscow Olympic games of 1980. It took place in Tallinn, Estonia. In the same year the musician applied to the best universities in Moscow. The artistic challenges in GITIS, VGIK and the theatrical institute in the name of Boris Shukin were all successfully overcome. However he chose GITIS. In 1985 Mikhail received an award during the XII World festival of youth and students, where tens of thousands of people from 157 countries participated. In 1987 he was awarded during the TV competition ¬´When soldiers sing¬ª. The Military service of Mikhail Kotlyarov was twice: in the Krasnoznamyonnii singing and dancing ensemble of the Soviet Army lead by S. A. Alexandrov and in the song and dance ensemble of the air defense forces. After he finished service, Mikhail worked in a children‚Äôs musical theater under the leadership of Natalia Ilyinichna Satz ‚Äì a famous soviet director of opera and theater plays. During this time Mikhail met his future wife ‚Äì a Frenchwoman with a Russian name Natalia. Soon she introduced her young husband to the famous French fashion designer Pierre Cardin. This predetermined many events to come in the future life of the musician. In 1990s the married couple moved to France. Mikhail became a postgraduate of the Paris Conservatory. During this time the glamorous opera diva ‚Äì Galina Pavlovna Vishnevskaya ‚Äì was his mentor and teacher. Pierre Cardin was touched by the artwork of Mikhail and did a lot to ensure that as many fans of opera music as possible got to know this Russian talent. A charity concert initiated by a member of the Romanov tsar dynasty ‚Äì Prince V.K. Romanov - became an excellent occasion. The upper class society of opera singing admirers was invited in the family mansion of the Conde princes, in the Chantilly residence. This was the first sortie of the magnificent tenor from Russia. In 1991 the musician was invited together with the Royal London Orchestra to record the Symphony No. 2 of Dmitrii Shostakovich. Later Pierre Cardin organized the meeting with his renowned colleague Yves Saint Laurent and the director of the Paris Opera house (¬´Opera de Bastille¬ª) Pierre Berger. They offered Mikhail to sing the role of Herman in Petr Tchaikovsky‚Äôs opera ¬´Pikovaya Dama¬ª. Then the 29-year-old Russian talent took one of the main international stages. Invitations followed one after the other. The big theatrical stage of Geneva, ¬´Capitol¬ª of Warsaw, the Parisian ¬´Opera de Bastille¬ª and one of the best concert scenes ¬´The Champs Elysees¬ª, the Vienna state Opera, ¬´La Scala¬ª in Milan, the Moscow Conservatorium named after Tchaikovsky and the Moscow Academic Philharmonic Society, concert stages of the Cannes and Vienna film festivals. Even today Mikhail Yurievich is a welcome guest of multiple opera festivals and concerts, which take place on the stages in many countries of the World. In 2005 with the academic Russian chorus in the name of A.V. Sveshnikov and the Big Symphonic orchestra Mikhail Kotlyarov recorded famous arias of J. Rossini. After that he went on an opera tour in Kazakhstan, organized by the head of state ‚Äì Nursultan Nazarbaev. And straight after that he made an unforgettable performance in the Italian city of Florence. In 2008 the organizers of the all-Russian national award ¬´Olymp¬ª were honored to invite Mikhail to perform during the opening ceremony. That same year his first musical solo album ¬´Destiny¬ª (¬´Sudba¬ª) was highly demanded by opera singing admirers. The next important step in the work of the musician was a joint project with the American musician and producer Walter Afanasieff. In the list of his ¬´Star¬ª clients were such names as Whitney Huston, Celine Dion, Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey and many other popular musicians. After several months of collaboration Kotlyarov and Afanasieff released one more record ¬´IN ONE BREATH¬ª (¬´V odno dikhanie¬ª). It was a fantastic success. Randy Jackson, an American bass player, vocalist, art manager and the creator of the top-rated show ¬´American Idol¬ª, Emmy Award winner, helped with the promotion and sales of the album. Two years ago, in October 2015, another album of the Russian musician was released. The album was called ¬´Mikhail Kotlaroff ‚Äì Unity of Variety. The compositions were presented in an unusual style ¬´Classical crossover¬ª, which is an organic mix of different styles of music and opera singing. The best-hit maker of Europe worked on the album, and a Berlin sound studio was chosen for recording. Today the records are successfully sold in the top media players and Internet shops.

Fire On Tuesday 21 May 1918, a fire gutted the Fowler plant, as well as several frame, flat and apartment houses, as the blaze swept over a block, making 100 families homeless. The entire block between 12th and 13th Streets, and between Howard and Mission Streets, was gutted. \\"A double three alarm brought practically all the fire apparatus in the city.\\"Staff writer, \\"Fire Follows Threat From Incendiaries\\" clipping, unknown publication, San Francisco, California, date not recorded. Fifteen aircraft in various stages of construction, including two completed ones that were to have been delivered that day, were destroyed as were equipment and parts enough to construct 50 airplanes. A considerable quantity of dried spruce and Irish linen were consumed by the fire. Machinery used in construction was considerably damaged. Employees estimated the value of the lost materials at between $250,000 and $1,000,000. \\"The total damage to the airplane factory and surrounding buildings was estimated at $750,000 by S. S. Dibbero, a director of the Fowler concern. The factory, it was said, will be rebuilt.\\"Associated Press, \\"Airplanes Lost in Costly Fire\\", The Idaho Daily Statesman, Boise, Idaho, Saturday 22 May 1918. Another source states that the fire began in the planing mill of the L & E Emanuel Furniture Company, adjacent to the aircraft factory, and with whom Fowler had contracted for the production of parts. German sympathizers had made threats against firms supporting the American war effort, and Fowler had hired full-time security guards for the prior month. \\"The origin of the fire has not yet been determined, but a cursory investigation by factory officials, fire wardens and the police revealed no traces of incendiarism.\\"Wire service, \\"Fifteen Air Planes Are Destroyed By Big Fire\\", Daily News, Red Bluff, California, Wednesday 22 May 1918, Volume XXXIV, Number 169, page 1. \\"Fowler lost a fortune in linen fabric and nine completed aircraft with Hall-Scott (Liberty) engines ready for delivery to a Texas military field.\\"Koontz, Giacenta Bradley, \\"Factory Fires and Other Challenges of Aircraft Builder\\", Director of Maintenance, Saturday 1 October 2011.

Post-war In the 26 April 1920 issue of Aerial Age Weekly, it was announced that the Interallied Aircraft Corporation, with headquarters in New York City, had just appointed the Fowler Airplane Company of 1065 Phelan Building, San Francisco, as their western agents and distributors.Editors, \\"Interallied Appoints Western Agent\\", The Aircraft Trade Review, Aerial Age Weekly, Aerial Age Company, Inc., New York City, 26 April 1920, Volume XI, Number 7, page 217.

The shipment is the first arrival of any British planes on the Western Coast, and the interested are eagerly awaiting the first take off, as San Francisco being in the belt of all year round flying, the demand for airplanes for personal use is beginning to be felt. The Avros will fly from the Marina at the water-front, and plans are being made for installing a complete service organization and sales force throughout every city of any size or importance in the state of California. The Fowler Airplane Company predicts a tremendous advance in the use of airplanes for commercial purposes within the coming year.\\"Editors, Aircraft Journal, The Gardner, Moffat Company, Inc., Highland, New York, 17 May 1920, Volume VI, Number 20, page 13.

The item adds that \\"One of the first inquiries to be received was from the city and county of San Francisco for a plane to be used on the city's water project at Hetch Hetchy in the High Sierras.

The Interallied Aircraft Corporation plans to import numerous British former military aircraft into the United States for sale and use was abruptly halted by a District Court ruling, on 9 July 1920, in a lawsuit brought by Wright Aeronautical. The Chicago Daily Tribune reported that \\"The plan of British Interests to flood this country with thousands of British war planes at practically junk prices appears to be defeated by a decision handed down by Judge Thomas I. Chatfield In the United States District Court, Brooklyn. Curiously enough, the decree which may save the American manufacturers from ruin and the air service for dependence on foreign airplanes was based upon the fact that the airplane in its present form is strictly an American invention. The decree was obtained by the Wright Aeronautical company of Paterson, N.J., holder of the patent rights of Orville and Wilbur Wright, and perpetually prohibits the Interallied Aircraft corporation [sic] of New York from using or selling foreign airplanes in this country. Col. William Bishop is head of this organization.\\"Special, \\"Court Decision May Bar British Planes From U. S.\\", Chicago Daily Tribune, Saturday 10 July 1920, Volume LXXIX, Number 165, page 1.

As Billy Bishop and fellow ace William Barker had apparently dissolved their partnership by this time, it is probable that the Fowler Aircraft Company was forced out of business at this same time.

Budai-Deleanu studied in the College of Saint Barbara in Vienna. After completing his doctorate at the University of Erlau, he settled in Lemberg (now Lviv in Ukraine). He finished an epic poem, entitled »öiganiada (\\"Gypsy Epic\\"), about a band of gypsies that fought alongside the army of Vlad the Impaler, the medieval ruler of Wallachia. He was one of the first proponents of the idea of the unification of the lands that now form Romania. He proposed that the union should be achieved under the rule of the Habsburgs, through the annexation of Wallachia and Moldavia into the Grand Principality of Transylvania. According to Budai-Deleanu, the Dacians did not have a role in the ethnogenesis of the Romanian people. He thought that the Dacians were the ancestors of the Poles. He promoted the purification of the Romanian language from loanwords, proposing that only borrowings from Italian and French should be permitted. He also strove for the replacement of the Cyrillic script with the Latin alphabet.
