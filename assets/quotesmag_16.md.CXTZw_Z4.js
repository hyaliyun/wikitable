The temple is situated on Jalan Tukang Emas, also known as \\"Harmony Street\\" because of its proximity to the Kampung Kling Mosque and Cheng Hoon Teng Temple. The temple was built by Thavinayagar Chitty, the leader of the Chitty people, in 1781 after the Dutch colonial government of Malacca gave him a plot of land. The temple is dedicated to Vinayagar or Ganesha, the elephant deity.Virtual Tourist - Melaka Temples In the back room is a sculpture of the deity with the head of an elephant and the body of a man with four hands. There is another altar dedicated to Lord Muruga, the younger brother of Lord Vinayagar. History The Dutch colonial government in Malacca granted the Chitty community a piece of land, in the heart of Malacca City in the 1780s. The land was located at Goldsmith Street, now known as Jalan Tokong, bearing Lot No. 62 Town Area XIU and measuring for the purpose of setting up a Hindu temple. The temple was built up in the year 1781 according to the date mentioned in the Dutch grant (freehold title). The temple was under the trusteeship of the late Mr. Thaivanayagam Chitty, who was then a leader of the Chitty community. Architecture The simplification of culture and customs can be seen at the Sri Poyatha Moorthi Temple. Distinct from the South Indian temples, which have a complex Dravidian Architecture in the Pallava style, which displays carved out sculptures of the Hindu gods in many rows, the Chitty temple tend to only have one row, or a picture of one single god in each of the three rows, as evidenced in the Sri Poyatha Moorthi Temple. Administration The 'Sri Poyatha Venayagar Moorthi Temple', although the property of the ‚ÄúMalacca Chetti or Chetti of Malacca‚Äù, has been managed by the 'Malacca Nagarathar Nattukkottai Chettiar' for more than 20 years through an agreement (since 1962) made between them because the British colonial government prior to Malaysian independence that refused to allow the chettiar group to put up another Hindu temple of their own in the Malacca Town area. The temple was built in the year 1781 according to the date mentioned in the Dutch grant (freehold title). Festivals The Malacca Chittys observe rituals, festivals and ceremonies, such as Thai Pongal, Madhu Pongal for those who rear cows, Kani Pongal especially for maidens, Deepavali, putting 'Kolams' and flowers during the month of Margali on the doorsteps, Kelemays Sarasvathi (Ahyutha poojas), Sivarathri, Egadesi, Amman Thiruviza, carrying of the Kavadis during the months of Thaipusam, Masimagam, Sithrai, Panguni Utharam, Adi matham prayers and the taking out of the Rathams (Religious Chariots) in procession for some festivals. There are three Rathams made of wood with lovely carvings of Indian Deities, and dating back some 200 years. The Rathams are maintained in good condition and kept in the temple grounds. One Ratham is for Lord Ganesha, one for Lord Subramaniar Swamy, and one for Lord Rama Swamy. They are used during festive seasons drawn by bullocks and are lighted with decorative lamps making them look beautiful at night. The 'Sri Muthu Mariamman Thiruvizha' festival during the Sitrai matham (April/May) is major celebration among the Chitty diaspora who are currently spread over Malaysia and Singapore.

It is also locally known as Tini-mundia deula due to the three spires on top of it, a very distinct and unusual feature. The three spires are believed to represent the three powers of the goddess Chamunda - Mahasaraswati, Mahalakshmi and Mahakali. Architecture Baita·∏∑a Deu·∏∑a Temple‚Äôs striking feature is the shape of its sanctuary tower. The semi-cylindrical shape of its roof is a leading example of Khakhara order of temples‚Äî which bears an affinity to the Dravidian Gopuram of the South Indian temples. Its gabled towers with a row of Shikharas reveals unmistakable signs of southern intrusion.D.P.Ghosh, Nirmal Kumar Bose and Y.D.Sharma. Designs from Orissan Temples. P.24 The plan of the deu·∏∑a is oblong and the jagamohana is a rectangular structure, but embedded in each angle is a small subsidiary shrine. Baitala deu·∏∑a boasts of some figures, although executed in relief, are however characterized by delicacy of features and perfect equipoise. The outer walls are encrusted with panels of Hindu deities, mostly Shiva and his consort Parvati in her Shakti form, hunting processions, capturing of wild elephants and the occasional erotic couples. The facade of the deu·∏∑a above the left of the jagamohana is dominated by two chaitya windows‚Äîthe lower one having a beautifully carved figure of Surya the Sun God noted for its facial expression, with Usha (Dawn) and Pratyusha shooting arrows on either side and with Aruna in front, driving a chariot of seven horses. The medallion in the upper Chaitya window houses a 10-armed Nataraja or dancing Shiva. In front of the flat roofed Jagamohana is a stone post relieved with two Buddha like figures seated in Dharma-Chakra-Pravartana mudra. Another striking feature is temple's Tantric associations, marked by eerie carvings in the sanctum and the image enshrined in the central niche, eight armed Chamunda, locally known as Kapa·∏∑ini, is the terrifying form of goddess Durga. Thus, BaitƒÅ·∏∑a Deu·∏∑a is a Shakti shrine. The Deity Vertical panorama of the entire temple The presiding deity, Chamunda or Charchika sits on a corpse flanked by a jackal and an owl and decorated with a garland of skulls. She holds a snake, bow, shield, sword, trident, thunderbolt and an arrow, and is piercing the neck of the demon. The niche is capped by a chaitya window containing seated figures of Shiva and Parvati. The Chamunda is surrounded by a host of other smaller size allied deities carved in the lower parts of the walls, each within a niche separate by a pilaster. The figure on the east wall, to the right of the door, is a skeleton form of Bhairava forming the counterpart of Chamunda. The other, carved on the north wall, rises from ground, having filled his skull-cup with the blood of a person whose severed head lies on the right. On the pedestal is an offering of two more heads on a tray resting on a tripod, flanked by a jackal feasting on the decapitated body on the right and a woman holding a head on the left. The tantric character of the temple is also marked by the stone post, to which sacrificial offerings were tethered, just in front of the jagamohana. Artificial light is needed to see in the darkness of the interior, though early morning sun lights up the interior.

Sacramental activity thus encompasses all of God's activity towards the Church because it always involves the elements of humanity and mystery / sacred. Vorgrimler is conscious of the distinction between sacramental activity and sacraments and understands the seven sacraments as existing objectively in the world, though not on their own grounds but always in relation to Christ and the Church.

Its nearest town is Ringwood, which lies approximately 1.8 miles (2.9 km) south from the hamlet. It is in the civil parish of Ellingham, Harbridge and Ibsley. Overview Rockford is a hamlet close to the village of Ellingham. It is separated from Ellingham by a series of lakes known collectively as Blashford Lakes, which have been created as the result of sand and gravel extraction since the 1950s.Blashford Lakes , Hampshire & Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust The hamlet has one pub known as The Alice Lisle.The Alice Lisle, Rockford, Daily Echo, retrieved 8 March 2012 Close to Moyles Court, next to the lane leading to Linwood, stands the Moyles Court Oak, one of the largest trees in the New Forest, and which could be older than the famous Knightwood Oak.Knightwood Oak, Eagle Oak and other Ancient New Forest Trees, New Forest Explorers Guide, retrieved 8 March 2012 The lanes about the hamlet harbour the suckering remnants of Goodyer's Elm, a rare and unusual tree discovered by John Goodyer in 1624, but decimated by Dutch elm disease in the late 20th century.Chatters, C.

The 17th century manor house was once the home of Dame Alice Lisle, the last lady to be publicly beheaded in England following a judicial trial.http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1715-1754/member/lisle- edward-1692 In 1940 the building was requisitioned by the RAF, who stationed the headquarters for the Ibsley Airfield there for six years.http://www.thenewforestguide.co.uk/history/forest-airfields/ibsley/ History Moyles Court School Rockford is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 when it was held by Hugh of St Quentin. Rockford had passed to the Moels family by the 13th century and it stayed in that family until the death of John de Moels in 1337.Ellingham - Victoria County History of Hampshire The manor passed to his daughter Isabel, wife of William Botreaux. The manor stayed in the Botreaux family until the late 15th century when it was sold to Robert White. The White family then held it until William White died in 1594, leaving an only daughter, Alice wife of William Beconshaw. After this time Rockford passed like Ellingham to the Lisle family, Moyles Court in Rockford becoming their chief residence. Alice Lisle, widow of John Lisle the regicide, continued to live at Moyles Court after her husband's assassination in 1664, until her own notorious trial and death by beheading in the market-place at Winchester in 1685 after the failure of the Monmouth Rebellion. Rockford was eventually restored, like Ellingham, to her son John. In the middle of the 19th century Edward Hayles Taylor sold Rockford to Henry Baring of Somerley, from whom it was purchased by John Coventry of Burgate Manor. Moyles Court, however, was sold to the Earl of Normanton with Ellingham. A chapel at Rockford, subject to the church of Ellingham, was granted by Walter of St Quentin, with the tithe from his house, to the abbey of Saint-Sauveur-le- Vicomte about 1170, and mass was to be said there three times a week by the chaplain of Ellingham or a monk. No trace of it remains, but it probably stood in the \\"Chapell field\\" mentioned in an indenture of 1664. A watermill belonged to Rockford Manor in the 13th century, but by 1337 was in bad repair, and in 1349 it was almost in decay. It is mentioned in 1664, but no trace of it exists at the present day. The right of free fishing was attached to the manor in the 18th century.

Twenty-one genera are ascribed to Tainoceratidae, of which 10 are confined to the Triassic while four cross into the Triassic after surviving the Permian-Triassic extinction. Seven are restricted to the Paleozoic. References * Bernhard Kummel, 1964 Nautiloidea -Nautilida. Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, Part K.

Ê∞óË±°Â∫Å„ÅåÂëΩÂêç„Åó„ÅüÊ∞óË±°Âèä„Å≥Âú∞ÈúáÁÅ´Â±±ÁèæË±° It had a magnitude of 7.7 on the moment magnitude scale and a maximum felt intensity of VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale. It triggered a major tsunami that caused deaths on Hokkaid≈ç and in southeastern Russia, with a total of 230 fatalities recorded. The island of Okushiri was hardest hit, with 165 casualties from the earthquake, the tsunami and a large landslide. Tectonic setting The northwestern side of Honshu lies on the southeastern margin of the Sea of Japan, an area of oceanic crust created by back-arc spreading associated with the convergent boundary where the Pacific Plate is subducted beneath the Okhotsk Plate. The spreading was active from the late Oligocene to middle Miocene. The extensional tectonics associated with the spreading formed a series of N-S trending extensional faults and associated sedimentary basins. Currently the area is being deformed by contractional tectonics, causing inversion of these earlier basins, forming anticlinal structures. It has been suggested that the northwestern coast of Honshu represents an incipient subduction zone, but there remain significant uncertainties about the existence of the Okhotsk Plate and the nature and precise location of its boundary in the Sea of Japan, if it does exist. This region has been the location for several historical earthquakes, such as the 1964 Niigata and 1983 Sea of Japan earthquakes, with reverse fault mechanisms, on faults trending approximately north‚Äìsouth. Damage The earthquake shaking caused moderately severe damage, VIII on the Mercalli scale. The tsunami reached Okushiri between 2 and 7 minutes after the earthquake. A tsunami warning was given 5 minutes after the earthquake by the JMA. However, this was too late for the inhabitants of Okushiri. The quake caused fires to start in the town of Okushiri, adding greatly to the total damage. Characteristics =Earthquake= The earthquake had two distinct shocks. The first lasted for 20 seconds, while the second lasted 35 seconds. The rupture occurred on a fault that dipped at 24 degrees to the east. It had an estimated length of 150 km with a displacement of 2.5 m. The island of Okushiri subsided by 5‚Äì80 cm. =Tsunami= The tsunami inundated large parts of Okushiri, despite its tsunami defences. Okushiri had been struck by another tsunami 10 years earlier. A maximum run-up of 32 m was recorded on the western part of the island near Monai. A tsunami was widely observed in the Sea of Japan with a run-up of 3.5 m at Akita in northern Honshu, up to 4.0 m in southeastern Russia and up to 2.6 m on the coast of South Korea. =Landslide= The Okushiri-port landslide involved a volume of 1.5 x 105 m¬≥ of rock. The slide failure occurred at the base of a volcanic breccia bed. The slide occurred in two phases that may match the two separate shocks recorded for the earthquake. Aftermath The destructive power of this tsunami led to an overhaul of the sea defences on Okushiri involving the construction of tsunami sluices on a river and strengthened embankments. New escape routes were also provided and help was given for households to purchase emergency broadcast receivers.

JR Central plans to use the L0 series on the Ch≈´≈ç Shinkansen railway line between Tokyo and Osaka, which is under construction. The L0 series uses the Japanese-designed SCMaglev system. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Nippon Sharyo, a subsidiary of JR Central, are building fourteen pre-production vehicles. A seven-car train set a land speed record for rail vehicles of on 21 April 2015. The trains are planned to run at a maximum speed of , offering journey times of 40 minutes between Tokyo (Shinagawa Station) and , and 1 hour 7 minutes between Tokyo and Osaka. Specifications The end cars of L0 series trainsets are long and carry 24 passengers. The nose extends for better aerodynamics and reduced noise in tunnels. Intermediate cars are long and carry 68 passengers each. Each row is four seats wide, one less than JR Central shinkansen trains. The cars are more box-shaped than earlier models to allow for more interior space. Cars are painted white and blue. During normal operation, the train is expected to operate at a maximum speed of . The train does not require a driver, but does have a camera at the front of both end cars in order to allow for remote operation, in case the automated systems fail. The camera is more apparent on the revised end cars, planned to be introduced from 2020. It is moved to a higher position, and increased in size. The superconducting magnets in the bogies are built by Toshiba and Mitsubishi Electric. The cars are built by Nippon Sharyo, with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries also having built some in the past. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries stopped producing cars in 2017 after car manufacturing cost disagreements with JR central and the Mitsubishi SpaceJet's spiralling development costs. The bogies are arranged in a Jacobs bogie configuration.  Planned Operations  = Chuo Shinkansen = Construction on the Chuo Shinkansen line on which the train is intended to run began in December 2014. The first section to Nagoya is expected to be completed in 2027. That section will be approximately 85% tunnels with an estimated cost of ¬•5.5trillion (US$46.5billion). The relatively high cost is in large part due to the many tunnels. The complete line to Osaka is estimated to cost ¬•9trillion ($74.7billion), and was expected to be completed by 2045, after an eight-year pause in construction to recuperate costs. However, after receiving a ¬•3trillion ($28billion) loan from the Japanese government, JR Central moved the project forward. It now expects to be able to open the full line as early as 2037, with construction beginning immediately after completion of the Tokyo‚ÄìNagoya section. = Northeast Maglev = A route from Washington, D.C. to Baltimore, eventually extending all the way to New York City has received political support in the United States. JR Central chairman Yoshiyuki Kasai spoke with U.S. President Barack Obama about the L0 series during Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's 28 April 2015 visit. In August 2017, development partner Mitsubishi announced that talks had \\"stalled\\" because of \\"a lack of clarity on the Trump administration's stance on high-speed rail\\". In March 2019, Northeast Maglev project director David Henley stated in an interview that they expect to have a Record of Decision for the D.C.‚ÄìBaltimore section by August 2020, and to begin construction later that same year, or in early 2021. According to Henley, this would allow operations to begin in 2027‚Äì28, allowing for a construction period of 7 years. History A seven-car trainset undergoing test-running in August 2014 = L0 series = The first L0 series vehicle was delivered to the Yamanashi Maglev Test Line and unveiled to the press in November 2012. The first five vehicles were linked up and placed on the guideway in June 2013.\\"Prototype of high-speed maglev train shown to public\\" . Asahi Shimbun, 3 June 2013. The first five-car train began test- running at the Yamanashi Maglev Test Line in June 2013, following completion of extension and upgrade work at the facility, earlier than the originally scheduled September date. The maximum speed of test runs was gradually increased, reaching 500 km/h by the end of July 2013. The five-car train was lengthened to seven cars in September 2013, and test-running as a 12-car formation commenced on 25 June 2014. The train was reverted to a 7-car formation later in 2014, and used for public preview rides starting in November. A series of endurance and speed tests was carried out on the test rail in April 2015 to examine the reliability and durability of the L0 after repeated high speed usage. Several speed and distance records were set in the process. After April 2015, the train returned to being used for public preview rides. = Improved L0 Series = The L0 series are planned to be replaced with a revised model from May 2020 (named the \\"Improved L0 series\\"). This will be the first L0 series to receive power from the guideway, through induction. Currently, on-board power is provided by a small gas generator in each end car. The new end cars also feature a relocated and enlarged camera, and are more aerodynamic thanks to the removal of the exhaust vent necessary for the generator. Only one end car will be replaced by 2020, as well as one intermediate car. This means that the train will consist of a combination of revised and original cars for a period of time, and will be able to generate electricity with its onboard generator while testing the new induction system. The new cars were completed in March 2020. While presenting the new end car to the press, lead designer Motoaki Terai stated that this model represents the completion of around 80‚Äì90% of the design goals for the final train.  Variants  L0 Series: 1 √ó 12-car set owned by JR Central, introduced from 2011 and planned to be converted to the Improved L0 series from June 2020.

They are predominantly published at a scale of 1:25.000, although some individual sheets have scales of 1:50.000 and 1:100.000. The cartographic library of the German (DAV) and Austrian Alpine Clubs (OeAV) currently has about 70 different high mountain maps. Also, individual map sheets of the Alpine region or other interesting mountain areas in the world are continually being published. The publication of its maps has been a function of the Alpine Club since 1865. The reason the two clubs still issue their maps is to complement the range of more or less good official maps of the high mountains with special large-scale maps. This is especially true for the Austrian Alpine region, which is the classical field for Alpine Club branches (sections). Here, there are no official maps at a scale of 1: 25.000, so the Alpine Club fills an important gap in the maps available.  Characteristics  The characteristics of AV maps are their large scale (usually 1:25,000), high accuracy, and a great wealth of terrain detail in the high mountains (rock, rubble, glaciers, etc.). The contour interval is a maximum of 20 metres. The mountaineer should therefore be able to orient himself well using Alpine Club maps, both on the marked trails or in open terrain, i.e. away from the marked routes. In addition, the map sheets are divided in a way suitable for climbers and hikers with overlapping map sheets and a focus on the high mountain regions. Map names and height information (spot heights) are more densely printed than in other comparable maps.

In this book, the sport is ice hockey.The Million Dollar Goal at Fantastic Fiction Plot summary Twins Dawn and Dusk Rosenberg love hockey, and have been playing hockey since they were in the mighty mite league. They live outside Montreal, and their dad does not have much of a connection to hockey than to baseball. Mr. Rosenberg would never buy hockey gear for Dawn or Dusk, and makes them pay with their own money. The two even wrote haikus about hockey, Dusk's being more about the violence seen in hockey whatsoever. But to Dawn and Dusk's surprises, their dad buys them tickets to the Montreal Canadiens (\\"Well, we both just about fainted!\\") from one of his clients who couldn't use the season tickets that night. Dusk then tells about his grandmother, Sophie \\"Oma\\" Rosenberg, who apparently farts all the time and enters every contest she sees. She mostly wields a walker and (for long distances) a wheelchair. Oma also curses most of the time in her language. She has a great desire for Elvis Presley, and still has a Velvet Elvis (Mrs. Rosenberg calls it \\"khalooscious\\") on the wall as a good luck charm, and throws a fit when it is taken down. Oma tends to be embarrassing to Dusk and Dawn, cursing and farting in front of her friends. Dusk wishes Oma would die sooner or late ARMANt the Molson Centre, the Rosenbergs' tickets are for section 203, which Dusk complains to. Mr. Rosenberg even brings a video camera, already having a bunch of video collections in their basement. They take the elevator to the 200 level. Oma's complaining of not being able to see ends up in Dusk and Oma switching seats. The Canadiens end up behind 4-0 in the first period, and worsening. The team loses 8-1, but afterwards, the lucky winner of the Million Dollar Goal Contest would be chosen, but through a JumboTron screen, which would sweep around and around to choose a section, and then would go in and out to choose a row. Section 203 (the section the Rosenbergs are sitting in) was chosen, and then Row L (the row the Rosenbergs are sitting in) was chosen, but the lucky winner was none other than a fast- asleep Oma. Mrs. Rosenberg believes Oma cannot take the shot, thinking Oma might fall and break a hip. Even when Dawn points out all the things affordable to buy, Mr. Rosenberg still refuses to let his mother take the shot for \\"a cool new video game system.\\" Dawn suggests that the shot would be made easier for Oma, in which Dusk agrees for once. Their dad instantly believes Oma was chosen because she was an old \\"cripple\\" who couldn't walk, so they wouldn't have to pay off the million dollars. Oma rolls in and asks where she left her teeth, but quickly finds them in her mouth. But, however, Oma says she isn't a cripple and would take the shot. Dawn and Dusk end up having to train Oma for the big day, Oma to shoot goals on a layer of plastic ice, but Oma accidentally slips and falls, Dawn unable to grab her arm to prevent her. Oma is rushed to the hospital, but she never really broke anything. She however is reported to be a terrible hockey player, unable to make the NHL if she would fall taking just a slap shot. She refused to take painkillers, as that was what killed her role model, Elvis Presley. Oma has her walker taken away and must use a wheelchair on a daily basis, but she says she would still take the shot. Oma must rest in bed for the next 2 days with no physical activity; Dawn and Dusk are afraid to try and retrain Oma after her first training. Mrs. Rosenberg tells them how people need something worth living for, an example being the achievement of Dawn and Dusk's other grandmother's wish to see the 21st century.

During a career that has spanned over 30 years, Tim Burton has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his direction. 1980s =After Hours= Burton was originally attached to direct the 1985 film After Hours, but Martin Scorsese read the script at a time when he was unable to get financial backing to complete The Last Temptation of Christ, which was finally completed in 1988; Burton gladly stepped aside when Scorsese expressed interest in directing After Hours. =Big Top Pee-wee= After the 1985 film, Burton was offered the opportunity to direct Big Top Pee-wee, but had no interest and was already working on his own pet project, Beetlejuice. =Hot to Trot= After the success of Pee-wee's Big Adventure (1985), and before his hiring of Beetlejuice (1988), Warner Bros. sent Burton various scripts. He was disheartened by their lack of imagination and originality, one of them being Hot to Trot (1988).Salisbury, Burton, pp. 54 1990s =Conversations with Vincent= Burton held a fascination with Vincent Price films since his childhood. He first worked with the actor on the 1982 television film Hansel and Gretel, and a second collaboration on the 1982 short film Vincent. During the production of Edward Scissorhands (1990), in which Price portrayed the inventor, Burton conceived the idea of making an independent documentary film on the actor,Hanke, pp. 116, 187 using the working title Conversations with Vincent.Salisbury, Burton, pp. 98 With self-financing from his own production company, Burton shot the film in black-and-white over a three-day period at the Vincent Price Gallery in East Los Angeles College in April 1991. In addition to Price, Roger Corman and Samuel Z. Arkoff were interviewed. Conversations with Vincent was stalled when Burton went to work on Batman Returns (1992), and after Price's death in October 1993. In December 1994, it was announced that Burton was returning to the hour-long documentary. Lucy Chase Williams, author of The Complete Films of Vincent Price, was working as a consultant. The film likely would have been released in the direct-to-video market, but the project was ultimately abandoned and remains unfinished. =Beetlejuice sequel attempts= Warren Skarren wrote a sequel script called Beetlejuice In Love, but was unable to keep polishing his story past the first draft due to his sudden death. Later in 1990, Burton hired writer Jonathan Gems for write a sequel to Beetlejuice, entitled Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian. In early 1991, Burton was still interested in directing the sequel, and hired Daniel Waters to yet another script, but the two decided to focus on Batman Returns. Waters story outline involved Beetlejuice appearing in the White House and harassing the Clinton family. By August 1993, producer David Geffen hired Pamela Norris (Troop Beverly Hills, Saturday Night Live) to rewrite the script. In 1996, Warner Bros. decided to hire Kevin Smith to write another of the Hawaiian script, but he turned down the offer to write the script of the unmade Superman Lives. In March 1997, Gems released a statement saying \\"The Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian script is still owned by The Geffen Film Company and it will likely never get made. You really couldn't do it now anyway. Winona is too old for the role, and the only way they could make it would be to totally recast it. In September 2011, Warner Bros. hired Seth Grahame-Smith, who collaborated with Burton on Dark Shadows and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, to write and produce a sequel to Beetlejuice. Grahame-Smith signed on with the intention of doing \\"a story that is worthy of us actually doing this for real, something that is not just about cashing in, is not just about forcing a remake or a reboot down someone's throat.\\" He was also adamant that Michael Keaton would return and that Warner Bros. would not recast the role. Burton and Keaton have not officially signed on but will return if the script is good enough. Grahame-Smith met with Keaton in February 2012, \\"We talked for a couple of hours and talked about big picture stuff. It's a priority for Warner Bros. It's a priority for Tim. [Michael's] been wanting to do it for 20 years and he'll talk to anybody about it who will listen.\\" The story will be set in a real time frame from 1988; \\"This will be a true 26 or 27 years later sequel. What's great is that for Beetlejuice , time means nothing in the afterlife, but the world outside is a different story. In November 2013, Winona Ryder hinted at a possible return for the sequel as well by saying, \\"I'm kind of sworn to secrecy but it sounds like it might be happening. It's 27 years later. And I have to say, I love Lydia Deetz so much. She was such a huge part of me. I would be really interested in what she is doing 27 years later.\\" Ryder confirmed that she would only consider making a sequel if Burton and Keaton were involved. In December 2014, Burton stated, \\"It's a character that I love and I miss actually working with Michael. There's only one Betelgeuse. We're working on a script and I think it's probably closer than ever and I'd love to work with him again.\\" In January 2015, writer Grahame-Smith told Entertainment Weekly that the script was finished and that he and Burton intended to start filming Beetlejuice 2 by the end of the year, and that both Keaton and Ryder would return in their respective roles. In August 2015, on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Ryder confirmed she would be reprising her role in the sequel. In May 2016, Burton stated, \\"It's something that I really would like to do in the right circumstances, but it's one of those films where it has to be right. It's not a kind of a movie that cries out [for a sequel], it's not the Beetlejuice trilogy. So it's something that if the elements are right‚Äîbecause I do love the character and Michael's amazing as that character, so yeah we'll see. But there's nothing concrete yet.\\" In October 2017, Deadline reported that Mike Vukadinovich was hired to write a script in time for the film's 30th anniversary. In April 2019, Warner Bros. stated the sequel had been shelved. =Mai, the Psychic Girl= Beginning in the late 1980s, new wave rock band Sparks attempted to make the Japanese manga Mai, the Psychic Girl into a musical, with interest from Burton and Carolco Pictures, who purchased the film rights in August 1991. Carolco hoped Burton would start production in 1992, but he chose to work on The Nightmare Before Christmas and Ed Wood for Touchstone Pictures. The option on the film rights eventually expired, and Burton dropped out. Francis Ford Coppola later developed the property in the late 1990s. In June 2000, Sony Pictures Entertainment started on a different project with Kirk Wong attached to direct. By February 2001, a script had been written by Lisa Addario and Joey Syracuse for Sony's Columbia Pictures. The release of The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman, a radio musical by Sparks, in August 2009, was informed by the six years the band spent trying to get their Mai, the Psychic Girl produced. The album generated new interest, and gained a \\"second wind\\", vocalist Russell Mael explained. \\"The music is all ready and we are hoping that this still might see the light of day.\\" On May 18, 2010, Burton expressed renewed interest in adapting the property. =Stay Tuned= Morgan Creek Productions originally wanted Burton to direct Stay Tuned because of his work on Beetlejuice and his art style, but Burton left the project to direct Batman Returns, the sequel to his 1989 Batman film, and was replaced by Peter Hyams while having some of the art styles paying tribute to Burton. =Singles television series= After the 1992 film Singles was released, which had Burton in a rare credited acting role, Warner Bros. Television tried to turn the film into a television series, but the project never materialized. The film's director Cameron Crowe claims that Singles inspired the television series Friends.DeRogatis, Jim. \\"As Crowe flies\\". Chicago Sun-Times. September 3, 2000. =Jurassic Park= Before Michael Crichton's novel Jurassic Park was published, Hollywood studios were highly interested in purchasing the film rights. This included Warner Bros. and Burton, Sony Pictures Entertainment and Richard Donner, and 20th Century Studios and James Cameron.Joseph McBride (1997). Steven Spielberg: A Biography. Faber and Faber, 416‚Äì9. Universal Pictures acquired the rights in May 1990 for Steven Spielberg, resulting in the 1993 film adaptation.Jurassic Park DVD production notes =Mary Reilly= Producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber acquired the film rights to Mary Reilly in 1989, and optioned them for Warner Bros. with Roman Polanski as director. When Guber became CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment later that year, he moved Mary Reilly to Sony's sister company, TriStar Pictures, where Burton was approached to direct with Denise Di Novi to produce in 1991. Christopher Hampton was hired to write the screenplay, and Burton signed on as director in January 1993, after he approved over Hampton's rewrite. He intended to start filming in January 1994, after he completed Ed Wood, but Burton dropped out in May 1993 over his anger against Guber for putting Ed Wood in turnaround. Stephen Frears was TriStar's first choice to replace Burton, and Di Novi was fired and replaced with Ned Tanen. The film ended up becoming the critically and commercially unsuccessful Mary Reilly in 1996, starring Julia Roberts and John Malkovich. =Catwoman= Batman Returns would be the last film in the Warner Bros. Batman film series that featured Burton and Michael Keaton as director and leading actor. With Batman Forever, Warner Bros. decided to go in a \\"lighter\\" direction to be more mainstream in the process of a family film. Burton had no interest in returning to direct a sequel, but was credited as producer.Tim Burton, Michael Keaton, Joel Schumacher, The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight: Reinventing a Hero, 2005, Warner Home Video With Warner Bros. moving on development for Batman Forever in June 1993, a Catwoman spin-off was announced. Michelle Pfeiffer was to reprise her role, with the character not to appear in Forever because of her own spin-off. Burton became attached as director, while producer Denise Di Novi and writer Daniel Waters also returned. In January 1994, Burton was unsure of his plans to direct Catwoman or an adaptation of \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\". On June 6, 1995, Waters turned in his Catwoman script to Warner Bros., the same day Batman Forever was released. Burton was still being courted to direct. Waters joked, \\"Turning it in the day Batman Forever opened may not have been my best logistical move, in that it's the celebration of the fun-for-the-whole-family Batman. Catwoman is definitely not a fun-for-the-whole-family script.\\"Judy Sloane (August 1995). \\"Daniel Waters on Writing\\", Film Review, pp. 67‚Äì69 In an August 1995 interview, Pfeiffer re-iterated her interest in the spin-off, but explained her priorities would be challenged as a mother and commitments to other projects. The film labored in development hell for years, with Pfeiffer replaced by Ashley Judd. The film ended up becoming the critically panned Catwoman (2004), starring Halle Berry. =Third Batman film= During the early development of the cancelled Catwoman spin-off, Burton expressed his interest in directing the third installment of the Batman film series that began with Batman in 1989. Warner Bros. was not happy with merchandise sales based on the second movie, they decided to change him and Burton put Joel Schumacher as the director of the third installment, leading to the release of Batman Forever, in which Burton was given top-billing producer credit, without being able to contribute ideas; only hiring director and screenplayers. =Cabin Boy= In 1993, Burton was set to direct Cabin Boy, but left to direct Ed Wood. Adam Resnick eventually directed the 1994 film, with Burton in a producer role. =The Fall of the House of Usher= In 1994, Burton was close to directing an adaptation of the Edgar Allan Poe short story \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\" with a screenplay by Jonathan Gems; he chose to direct Mars Attacks! instead. =The Hawkline Monster= Burton was to direct The Hawkline Monster, a western/monster film that was to star Clint Eastwood and Jack Nicholson, with a screenplay by Jonathan Gems; he chose to direct Mars Attacks! instead. =Go Baby Go= Burton considered directing Go Baby Go, a beach film in the style of filmmaker Russ Meyer, with a screenplay by Jonathan Gems; he chose to direct Mars Attacks! instead. =Geek Love= Burton bought the rights to Geek Love by Katherine Dunn in the 1990s. The story, about a traveling circus that uses chemicals to create genuine freaks, seemed perfect for Burton, but there has been no word about it since. In an interview with Dunn, she stated, \\"He's got the rights. That's half the battle right there. Though it no longer seems like something he'd do. It's a little too horror for him now in my opinion. Though I would love to see this film get made.\\" =Dinosaurs Attack!= Around 1995, writer Jonathan Gems wrote a screenplay for a film adaptation of Dinosaurs Attack!, with Burton as director. However, both Burton and Gems came to the conclusion that the project was too similar to Jurassic Park. =Toots and the Upside Down House= In 1996, when Burton was the CEO and founder of Walt Disney Animation Studios' stop-motion studio division Skellington Productions, he was going to produce the studio's planned third film, Toots and the Upside Down House, that was based on the book by Carol Hughes where a young girl still grieving over the death of her mother goes to a fantasy world inside her home when her dad still won't pay attention to her, where goblins, fairies and sprites live while helping the fairies battle an evil Jack Frost. Burton was attached to produce it, while Henry Selick was set to direct it (marking the third collaboration between Selick and Burton), with the screenplay written by Steven Soderbergh and co-produced by Disney's film partner at the time Miramax, which would have made it the first original animated film made by the company. However, Disney shut down the film's production, along with Skellington Productions, after the poor box office results of James and the Giant Peach. =Superman Lives= After Kevin Smith had been hired to rewrite a script called Superman Reborn, he suggested Burton to direct. It was Smith who convinced WB to change the title to Superman Lives. Burton signed on with a pay-or-play contract of $5 million and Warner Bros. set a theatrical release date for the summer of 1998, the 60th anniversary of the character's debut in Action Comics. Nicolas Cage was signed on to play Superman, with a $20 million pay-or-play contract, believing he could \\"reconceive the character\\". Producer Jon Peters felt Cage could \\"convince audiences he [Superman] came from outer space.\\" Burton explained Cage's casting would be \\"the first time you would believe that nobody could recognize Clark Kent as Superman, he [Cage] could physically change his persona.\\" Kevin Spacey was approached for the role of Lex Luthor, while Christopher Walken was Burton's choice for Brainiac,Tim Burton, Jon Schnepp, Lorenzo di Bonaventura, The Death of \\"Superman Lives\\": What Happened?, 2015 a role also considered for Jim Carrey and Gary Oldman. Sandra Bullock, Courteney Cox and Julianne Moore had been approached for Lois Lane, while Chris Rock was cast as Jimmy Olsen. Michael Keaton confirmed his involvement, but when asked if he would be reprising his role as Batman from Burton's Batman films, he would only reply, \\"Not exactly.\\" Burton immediately hired Wesley Strick to write a completely different story about the death and return of Superman. The film entered pre-production in June 1997, Burton gave art director Sylvain Despretz a concept drawing for Brainiac, which Despretz claims was \\"a cone with a round ball on top, and something that looked like an emaciated skull inside. Imagine you take Merlin's hat, and you stick a fish bowl on top, with a skull in it.\\" Filming was originally set to begin in early 1998. Burton chose Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania as his primary filming location for Metropolis, while start dates for filming were pushed back. For budgetary reasons, Warner Bros. ordered another rewrite from Dan Gilroy, delayed the film and ultimately put it on hold in April 1998. Burton then left to direct Sleepy Hollow. Burton has depicted the experience as a difficult one, citing differences with producer Jon Peters and the studio, stating, \\"I basically wasted a year. A year is a long time to be working with somebody that you don't really want to be working with.\\" =Goosebumps= When the Goosebumps film was in early production and was going to be made by 20th Century Fox and DreamWorks, Burton was originally going to produce it in 1998, with the option to direct. However, the project fell through and was later sold to Sony Pictures Entertainment, resulting in the 2015 film directed by Rob Letterman. =X: The Man with the X-ray Eyes= Burton developed a script for a remake of the 1963 science fiction B-film X: The Man with the X-ray Eyes with writer Bryan Goluboff, but it went unproduced. =Black Sunday= Around this time, Burton considered directing a remake of the 1960 Italian horror film Black Sunday.Burton, Tim. Interviewed in the documentary Mario Bava: Maestro of the Macabre, 2000, Image EntertainmentLucas, Tim Mario Bava All the Colors of the Dark, Video Watchdog, 2007. 2000s =Tim Burton's Lost in Oz= Tim Burton's Lost in Oz would be a television series based on L. Frank Baum's The Wizard of Oz book series. Burton would be its executive producer. A pilot episode was filmed in 2000, but the series became unproduced due to budget constraints. ‚Äì The Wizard of Oz at the Museum of Computer Adventure Game History ‚Äì Telarium Corporation at Adventureland =Ripley's Believe It or Not!= During the mid-2000s, Burton was scheduled to direct a film based on the famous Ripley's Believe It or Not! franchise, with Jim Carrey portraying Robert Ripley and a script by Ed Wood scribes Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski; the film ran over budget however, and was shelved by Paramount Pictures. Burton moved on to direct Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, and on October 23, 2008, Chris Columbus took over the Ripley's Believe It or Not! film, with Carrey still portraying Ripley, and on January 12, 2011, it was reported that Eric Roth will write the script. =The Nightmare Before Christmas sequel= In 2001, The Walt Disney Company began to consider producing a sequel to The Nightmare Before Christmas, but rather than using stop motion, Disney wanted to use computer animation. Burton convinced Disney to drop the idea. \\"I was always very protective of Nightmare not to do sequels or things of that kind,\\" Burton explained. \\"You know, 'Jack visits Thanksgiving world' or other kinds of things just because I felt the movie had a purity to it and the people that like it... Because it's a mass-market kind of thing, it was important to kind of keep that purity of it.\\" In 2009, Selick said he would do a film sequel if he and Burton could create a good story for it. In February 2019, it was reported that a new Nightmare Before Christmas film was in the works, with Disney considering either a stop-motion sequel or live-action remake. In October 2019, Chris Sarandon expressed interest on reprising his role as Jack Skellington if a sequel film ever materializes. =Planets of the Apes sequel= After the financial success of Planet of the Apes, Burton supposed that 20th Century Fox would hire him to make a sequel, that was planned to explain the cliffhanger ending of the first film, but instead the studio decided to reboot the franchise and in 2011, released Rise of the Planet of the Apes. =Batman: The Musical= In 2002, Burton, Jim Steinman, and David Ives had worked on a theatre production called Batman: The Musical. Steinman has revealed five songs from the musical. The first is the opening theme for \\"Gotham City\\" and the entry of Batman with his tortured solo \\"The Graveyard Shift\\"; followed by \\"The Joker's Song (Where Does He Get All Those Wonderful Toys?)\\", \\"The Catwoman's Song (I Need All The Love I Can Get)\\", \\"We're Still The Children We Once Were\\" (the climactic sequence) and \\"In The Land Of The Pig The Butcher Is King\\", sung by the corrupt blood- suckers ruling Gotham, covered on the Meat Loaf album Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose. After production was cancelled, these songs were released on the Batman: The Musical memorial site.Dark Knight of the Soul =Charlie and the Chocolate Factory musical= During production on the film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, a broadway musical was planned to accompany it. The studio and Burton reiterated their interest in May 2003, however, the project was cancelled by the time the film was released. =Third Pee-wee Herman film= In 2008, Paul Reubens approached Burton with one of two scripts and talked to Johnny Depp about the possibility of having him portray Pee-wee in a potential third film, but they both declined. =9 sequel= In an interview with 9 director Shane Acker: \\"I think there is definitely room. I mean, the way we end the film, there is a slight suggestion that it may be a new beginning. And I think we could continue the journey from where we left off and see how these creatures are existing in a world in which the natural environment is coming back and perhaps even threatening them in some way. Do they make the decision to not affect it, or do they try to affect it in some way? And do they still try to hold on to that humanity within them or do they recognize themselves at being machines too and go off on a different trajectory? So there's lots of idea that I think that we could play with and make another story out of.\\" No plans for a sequel have been made, but possibilities were mentioned via the film's 2009 DVD commentary. Director Acker has also mentioned the possibility of a sequel being made because of the lack of darker animated films, claiming that everything is G- and PG-rated with little to no dark elements. In 2009 he said that he will continue to make darker animated films, either doing so with a sequel to 9 or original ideas for future films. Before the theatrical release of the film, Acker and Tim Burton stated they were open for a sequel, depending on how well the film was received. Since the film's home release, there have been no further mentions of a sequel, with Acker focusing on projects announced in 2012 (Deep) and 2013 (Beasts of Burden), neither of which have been released as of December 2017. 2010s =Addams Family stop- motion animated film= In 2010, it was announced that Illumination Entertainment, in partnership with Universal Pictures, had acquired the underlying rights to the Addams Family drawings.

In July 2013, it was reported that the film was cancelled.

The film turned into the critically panned The Addams Family (2019) that was released on October 11, 2019. =Monsterpocalypse= In May 2010, DreamWorks announced that it had acquired the rights to a film adaptation of Monsterpocalypse, a Kaiju-themed collectible miniatures game. The studio had approached Burton for the project.

Burton would have also rendered the overall designs for the stage musical. Woolverton would have adapted her screenplay for the stage production.

On May 8, 2012, Variety reported that Warner Bros. may want to turn Dark Shadows into a film franchise. On May 18, 2012, Collider mentioned that the ending of Dark Shadows lends itself to a possible sequel. When Burton was asked if he thought that this could be a possible start to a franchise, he replied, \\"No. Because of the nature of it being like a soap opera, that was the structure. It wasn't a conscious decision. First of all, it's a bit presumptuous to think that. If something works out, that's one thing, but you can't ever predict that. The ending had more to do with the soap opera structure of it.\\" =Pinocchio= Robert Downey Jr. enlisted Burton to direct a Warner Bros. retelling of The Adventures of Pinocchio in 2012. Burton pursued Big Eyes and Ben Stiller was attached to direct. =Deep= On June 11, 2012, Shane Acker confirmed that Burton would work with Valve to create his next animated feature film, Deep. Like 9, the film will take place in a post-apocalyptic world (although set in a different universe). Deep would have been another darker animated film, as Shane Acker has expressed his interest in creating more PG-13 animated films. Since then, there has been no further announcements. However, despite the silence from Acker, in January 2017, the Facebook profile of the character \\"the Scientist\\" was updated with a rather cryptic message. The profile had been inactive since 2009, leading some to speculate the teasing of a sequel. =The Last American Vampire= On June 22, 2012, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, based on novel of the same name, was released to theaters, with Timur Bekmambetov as director and Burton in a producing role, leading to speculation that the sequel book The Last American Vampire would be adapted as well.The Last American Vampire However, due to the film bombing in the box office and poor critical receptions, talks of a sequel ceased.Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (2012).

The Class 20 was the third locomotive type to be designed and built in South Africa, after the Natal Government Railways 4-6-2TT Havelock of 1888 and the Class 2C of 1910. Construction The Class 20 2-10-2 Santa Fe type steam locomotive was designed in 1934 by A.G. Watson, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the South African Railways (SAR) from 1929 to 1936, and was built by the SAR at its Pretoria Mechanical Shops at Salvokop. The locomotive was intended for use on the South West Africa system, where the tracks consisted of section rail laid in desert conditions and practically without ballast. This restricted Watson to a maximum axle load of and he decided upon a Santa Fe type wheel arrangement with diameter coupled wheels and flangeless driving and intermediate coupled wheels.South African Railways & Harbours/Suid Afrikaanse Spoorwe√´ en Hawens (15 Aug 1941).

It was a hybrid, with a boiler which had been inherited from a Class 19A locomotive which had been equipped with a Watson Standard no. 1A boiler. The driving wheels were from scrapped Class 8 locomotives. The trailing pony truck was similar to that of the Class 19C, but the leading Bissel truck was specially designed. The bar frames and cylinders were imported. Even though it was not wholly a South African product with its imported frames and cylinders and its inherited boiler from a Swiss-built locomotive, this was the third recorded instance of steam locomotives designed and constructed in South African workshops after the Natal Government Railways' engine Havelock of 1888 and the Class 2C of 1910.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J.

Chapter III - Natal Government Railways (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, August 1944. p. 599. Characteristics The cylinders, with rotary cam poppet valve gear, were identical to those of the Class 19C but with the stroke reduced from to . The modified cylinder covers had deep spigots to suit the reduction in stroke. The main drive and valve gear drive was from the third pair of coupled wheels. Grease lubrication was provided for all coupled wheel axle boxes. The ten-coupled wheel arrangement, in conjunction with the sharp curvature of the lines in South West, necessitated special side play for the leading coupled wheel axle boxes and spherical bearings for the leading crank pins. The design of the leading Bissel truck necessitated certain proportions to suit the ten-coupled wheel arrangement, but the trailing Bissel truck was similar to that of the Class 19C. Its axle boxes were provided with end thrust pad bearings attached to the axle box covers, which relieved the ends of the bearing from the effects of end thrust. This device proved successful in reducing the number of hot boxes on trailing Bissels. The locomotive was tended by a Type MP1 tender with a coal capacity, a water capacity and a axle load. The total weight of the engine and tender in full working order was . Watson disliked articulated locomotives and his aim with the Class 20 was to build an as powerful as possible non-articulated locomotive with a maximum axle load. The resulting Class 20 could be considered as Watson's answer to the Class GCA Garratt locomotive which had very similar weight and tractive effort capacities. The Class 20 carried more water and coal than the Garratt and was about heavier with tractive effort compared to the of the Class GCA. Even so, only one Class 20 was produced and the design was not repeated. The construction of this sole Class 20 locomotive marked the beginning of a research process which was continued two years later with the construction of the sole Class 21 2-10-4 and which eventually culminated in the procurement of the Class 23 4-8-2 fleet in 1939. Service The locomotive was intended for goods traffic on light rail in South West Africa, even though freight traffic volumes in that territory were hardly enough to justify such a powerful engine. It was sent to various branches in the Eastern Transvaal to undergo tests before it entered service in South West Africa, but after some evidence that the engine was rather severe on the light track, it was returned to South Africa after comparatively short service. It was then allocated to Pretoria for working on the Eastern Transvaal System where its power capacity could be used more productively.Soul of A Railway, System 8, Part 2: Pretoria: including local services, workshops and running sheds, Part 2.

The Pretoria enginemen considered the Class 20 to be one of their best locomotives since it was free-steaming, more than usually trouble-free and able to handle any load they gave it. Condensing trials The arid nature of a large part of South Africa and the consequent difficulty to ensure adequate and suitable water supplies for steam locomotives led to a decision to experiment with condensing locomotives. Such locomotives had by then already been built by Henschel and Son for use in Argentina, 240 Kriegsloks for the Eastern Front in Germany in the 1930s and more than 4,000 units of the Russian SOK class, mainly for use in Turkestan and other arid regions of the Soviet Union. In the pre-war years, the SAR considered modifying a Class 12A into a condensing locomotive, but this never happened.Soul of A Railway, System 1, Part 4: Touws River to Beaufort West Introduction, Caption 6. (Accessed on 27 November 2016) Buckeye bogie In 1950, the Class 20 was modified to an experimental condensing locomotive in the Pretoria workshops, fitted with German Witte-style smoke deflectors, an extension to the chimney and a Type CL condensing tender which had been ordered from Henschel in 1948. This condensing tender, with Henschel works no. T28388, was designed for a Deutsche Reichsbahn Class 52 condensing locomotive. It was modified slightly and was equipped with a pair of Buckeye three-axle bogies instead of the German arrangement of one six-wheeled and one four- wheeled bogie. It had an coal capacity, a water capacity and a axle load.

(Accessed on 15 March 2017)Henschel & Son works list, compiled by Dietmar StresowEin Cham√§leon als Wegbereiter f√ºr die Karoo-Kamele (Accessed on 6 June 2016) The Type CL tender was designed in such a way that it could also be used on a modified Class 19D or Class 24, but this was never done. The tender was capable of condensing of exhaust steam per hour in maximum operating temperatures of between . As on the later Class 25 condensing locomotives, the pipe to feed spent steam back to the condensing tender was mounted on the left side of the engine. It was run back from the smokebox above the running board to a box that contained a centrifuge and filters to remove cylinder lubricant from the exhaust steam, then below the running board and underneath the cab to the tender. The tender had six large radiators on each side, cooled by three exhaust steam-driven roof-mounted fans which drew air from outside through the radiators. Beginning in 1951, tests with the condensing Class 20, named Pretoria, were conducted in the Eastern Transvaal and the Karoo. It proved the viability of condensing locomotives in South Africa by attaining a saving of between 88% and 93% on water as well as a lower coal consumption, the latter brought about by the higher temperature of the condensed feedwater. Depending on the operating conditions, a water range of between was achieved. At the end of 1951, the locomotive was relocated to Touws River where it was used for further condensing tests and occasionally put to work in regular service. The positive results of the condensing trials led to the introduction of the Class 25 condensing locomotive fleet in 1953. At that time, no. 2485 was again relocated, this time to De Aar for service on the section via Prieska to Upington on the line to Windhoek in South West Africa. It remained in service there until 1958. Even though its service record and uniqueness justified preservation, it was scrapped in 1961.

The museum was founded in 1931, and has a permanent exhibition of paintings and sculptures that includes works by major Croatian artists such as Vlaho Bukovac, Mato Celestin Medoviƒá, Branislav De≈°koviƒá, Ivan Me≈°troviƒá, Emanuel Vidoviƒá and Ignjat Job. The museum also has an extensive collection of icons, and holds special exhibits of works by contemporary artists. In 2009 the museum relocated to new premises in the old hospital building in Split, completely refurbished to provide a fully modern exhibit space. History In 1908, a Dalmatian art exhibition was held, the first to bring modern art to the city. Local artists, writers, musicians and architects at that time were training in other parts of Europe, bringing back exciting new trends. The Dalmatian governor, Nicholas Nardelli, bought several pieces from the show to form the basis of a new art gallery, giving them into the care of Kamilo Tonƒçiƒá, the director of the School of Crafts. Over the next 20 years, the collection grew and the art gallery idea was promoted. Approval was granted by the city in 1928, and the first exhibit opened to the public in 1931. Originally housed in a building in Lovretska Street, the museum's first director was Kamilo Tonƒçiƒá, the curator was Angjeo Uvodiƒá, and restorer Cata Duj≈°in. At the grand opening some 300 works of art were on display, from a total of 500 in the permanent collection. Over the years the collection grew through acquisitions, donations and bequests, most notably from Ivo Tartaglia, who donated over 300 works of art from his private collection. During the period 1950‚Äì1979, under the direction of Kruno Prijatelj, the gallery started running art education programs, published numerous publications, and began organizing exhibitions by contemporary artists. Today, holdings number more than 3,500 works covering the period from the 14th century up to the present day, representing all the major artistic developments in the area. Space in the original premises was limited and in 2001, Split City Council granted use of the old hospital building for conversion into a new exhibiting space. Because of the sensitive historic nature of the building (which dates from 1792) and its location next to the north wall of Diocletian's palace, the renovation necessarily involved the Ministry of Culture and its Department for Protection of Cultural Heritage ‚Äì Conservation Department in Split. Following the refurbishment, a fully modern exhibition space was created, appropriate for museum's growing collection. The new museum provides office and restoration workshops, as well as public areas and exhibit spaces. The ground floor is designed with an indoor atrium and north terrace with space for concerts, lectures and other performances throughout the year. The indoor atrium also offers visitors a bookstore, museum shop, and caf√©. Upstairs is the main exhibit space for the permanent collections. The north wing houses the restoration workshops, and an archive library. Collections The museum's permanent collection includes more than 3,500 works of art dating from the 14th century up to the present day. The holdings provide an overview of all the major art movements and trends in the local area, and include works by Croatian artists and artists from the former Yugoslavia, Italy, Germany, Austria, France, and the Czech Republic, all of whom have a connection to Split. The museum's restoration department focuses on the conserving the works and preparing them for public display. The museum also houses a large documentation archive of graphics, publications, press clippings, and photograph library. =Icons= The Museum of Fine Arts has one of the richest icon collections in Croatia, with works from the 15th to 19th century on display. In addition to those from the Cretan School, and Ionian School, holdings include icons from Russia and from the Greek mainland. Of special interest are icons from the 18th‚Äì19th century painted by masters from Boka Kotorska. The icons are mostly of small and medium sizes, indicating the original purpose of private devotion. =Old Masters= The early section covers 14th‚Äì18th centuries, and most notably includes work by the 14th-century Venetian artist Paolo Veneziano. Other artists include Andrija Alesi and Juraj ƒåulinoviƒá (15th century), Albrecht D√ºrer, Andrija Meduliƒá (16th century), Girolamo Brusaferro, and Matej Ponzoni and Federiko Benkoviƒá (17th century). =19th Century and Modern Art= The collection of 19th century and modern art forms the largest part of the museum's holdings. From the 19th century, the portraits by Juraj Pavloviƒá and Ivan Skvarƒçina are notable. The collection contains paintings by Vlaho Bukovac, Emanuel Vidoviƒá, Mato Celestin Medoviƒá, Ignjat Job, Juraj Planƒçiƒá and Marino Tartaglia. Sculptural works include pieces by Ivan Rendiƒá, Branislav De≈°koviƒá and Ivan Me≈°troviƒá. The collection also contains works by Vladimir Beciƒá, Oskar Herman, Miroslav Kraljeviƒá, Ljubo Babiƒá, Jerolim Mi≈°e, Ljubo Ivanciƒá, Antun Ka≈°telanƒçiƒá, Edo Murtiƒá, Kosta Angeli Radovani, Antun Masle, Slavko Kopaƒç, Sava ≈†umanoviƒá, Nade≈æda Petroviƒá, Petar Dobroviƒá and Branko Ru≈æiƒá. =Contemporary Art= The collection of contemporary art contains works of Croatian artists from the 1950s to the present day. Best known are the works of Ivo Dulƒçiƒá, Ljubo Ivanƒçiƒá, Slavko Kopaƒç, Ferdinand Kulmer, Branko Ru≈æiƒá, Ivan Ko≈æariƒá, and ƒêuro Seder. Constructivist and geometric trends in Croatian art are represented by members of the groups EXAT-51, and New Tendencies, such as Ivan Picelj, Julije Knifer and Juraj Dobroviƒá. From the 1980s, there are works by Damir Sokiƒá and Nino Ivanƒçiƒá, and a group that once formed the artistic core of Split: Kuzma Kovaƒçiƒá, Vasko Lipovac, Ka≈æimir Hraste and Gorky ≈Ωuvela.

Situated from Mitchelstown, County Cork, it became the first cave in Ireland to be developed for the public in 1972. The cave is located near Mitchelstown, Co Cork, but is actually in Tipperary off the R639 Mitchelstown. It is a privately owned local landmark and tourist destination, with a number of caverns open to the public through a guided tour. Noteworthy speleothems include the Tower of Babel column. The largest cavern, known as the T√≠r na N√≥g has hosted musical events including a performance by the Celtic Tenors.  History  While the presence of a nearby cave (referred to variously as Old Cave, Old Mitchelstown Cave or Desmond Cave) has been known in the area at least as far back as 1777, Mitchelstown Cave aka \\"New Cave\\" was discovered accidentally by Laura Condon, a farm worker on 3 May 1833. The Mitchelstown Caves are so called, in spite of their distance from Mitchelstown, due to their location on the old Kingston estate. The lord of the estate, Lord Kingsborough, had his seat in Mitchelstown Castle. Mitchelstown Cave was first explored and mapped in 1834 by James Apjohn, and subsequently visited by a large number of eminent naturalists and speleologists. In August 1857 Alexander Henry Haliday visited with Edward Percival Wright and recorded a number of animal species present. Members of the Dublin, Cork and Limerick Naturalist Field Clubs took part in a trip to the cave in July 1894 and also reported on the fauna found within. In 1895, √âdouard-Alfred Martel and H. Lyster Jameson visited and completed a new cave survey. In 1908 the cave was thoroughly explored and resurveyed again by Dr C. A. Hill, Dr A. Rule and Harold Brodrick of the Yorkshire Ramblers' Club, along with Robert Lloyd Praeger. A survey of Old Cave was also completed at this time.

History  The cooperation network arose out of the Northern Dimension Forum on Social Protection and Health held in the city of Joensuu, Finland, 2002. Only one year later the NDPHS was officially established by the so- called Oslo Declaration. Today the Partnership constitutes \\"an umbrella for activities on the regional, subregional and local levels, serving as a forum for coordination and synergies among the various actors.\\"Aasland, Aadne, 2008: Assessing the Northern Dimension Partnership in Public Health and Social Well- being, in: Aalto, Pami/Blakkisrud, Helge/Smith, Hanna (eds.): The New Northern Dimension of the European Neighbourhood, CEPS, Brussels, p. 91.  Objectives  According to the founding document the main goal of the NDPHS is \\"to promote sustainable development in the Northern Dimension area through improving human health and social wellbeing.\\"http://www.ndphs.org/internalfiles/File/About_NDPHS/Oslo_Declaration.pdf In doing so, reducing the spread of major communicable diseases and preventing life-style related non-communicable diseases as well as enhancing peoples‚Äô levels of social well-being and promoting socially rewarding lifestyles are further tasks of the NDPHS. All in all, as stated in the Oslo Declaration, \\"[t]he activities (‚Ä¶) should contribute to greater political and administrative coherence in the area, narrowing of social and economic differences, and to a general improvement of the quality of life and of the demographic situation.\\"Oslo Declaration, p. 2  Structure  The NDPHS is part of the Northern Dimension policy, which is a common policy shared by four equal partners: the European Union, Norway, Iceland and the Russian Federation. The policy‚Äôs main objectives are to provide a common framework for the promotion of dialogue and concrete cooperation, to strengthen stability and well-being, intensify economic cooperation, and promote economic integration, competitiveness and sustainable development in Northern Europe. The major decision-making body of the NDPHS network is the Partnership Annual Conference (PAC) which formulates the overall policy orientation of the Partnership. Another important body is the Committee of Senior Representatives (CSR) which is composed of high representatives from national administrations and decides amongst other on financial issues of the Partnership and the establishment of Expert Groups. Currently the Partnership is chaired by Latvia and co-chaired by Poland. The Chair rotates every two years. The major practical work e.g. the implementation of the NDPHS Strategy 2020 and its accompanying Action Plan, including elaboration and implementation of concrete projects is then done in the Expert Groups, according to their Terms of Reference. The Expert Groups consist of experts who have profound expertise in their related fields and experience in project management. The following expert-level structures are operating within the NDPHS after the restructuring that took place in 2015: Expert Groups *Expert Group on Antimicrobial Resistance (EG AMR) *Expert Group on Alcohol and Substance Abuse (EG ASA) *Expert Group on HIV, TB and Associated Infections (EG HIV, TB&AI;) *Expert Group on Non-communicable Diseases (EG NCD) *Expert Group on Occupational Safety and Health (EG OSH) *Expert Group on Primary Healthcare (EG PHC) *Expert Group on Prison Health (EG PH)http://www.ndphs.org/?expert_groups  Activities  The Partnership engages in a number of activities, including: policy and expertise exchange, information sharing and dialogue, project development and implementation, information production and dissemination and advocacy. The Partnership also works towards raising the awareness of the tremendous impact that health of populations has on the economic prosperity of the countries. Another priority is helping to convey relevant results and recommendations from ongoing and completed projects to the policy level. Furthermore, the Partnership is the Policy Area Coordinator for ‚ÄúHealth‚Äù in the EU Strategy of the Baltic Sea Region (EUSBSR).

The film premiered on September 4, 2011 at the Toronto International Film Festival and was screened at various film festivals in North America, receiving a limited theatrical release in a handful of international markets. The film's title, Twixt, refers to the two worlds explored in the film, the dream and the waking worlds. Twixt was released on Blu-ray and DVD by Fox Home Entertainment on July 23, 2013, and the film marks the on-screen reunion of former spouses, Kilmer and Whalley. Plot The film follows Hall Baltimore (Val Kilmer), a down-on-his-luck writer who specializes in novels based upon witch hunting. At a book signing, he is approached by Sheriff Bobby LaGrange (Bruce Dern), an eccentric fan with two requests: that Hall read his latest work and that he also accompany him to the morgue to view the body of a recent murder victim, as Bobby believes that it would make for a great story. Hall reluctantly agrees, and at the morgue he learns that the person was murdered by a serial killer. Despite offers from Bobby, Hall opts to not look at the victim's face. At the coffee shop he learns about a local hotel that once sheltered Edgar Allan Poe. This, along with the murders and various other odd features of the town, prompt Hall to announce to his wife, Denise (Joanne Whalley), that he wants to write a piece based upon the town. After falling asleep, Hall is shown wandering a dream- like version of the town, where he meets V (Elle Fanning), a young girl by the name of Virginia, who is nicknamed \\"Vampira\\" due to her strange teeth and braces. V tells Hall that she's a fan of his work but was unable to attend the signing due to the town's clock tower always giving seven different conflicting times. Hall attempts to persuade V to join him at the hotel for a soda, but she refuses to enter the lodging. Despite this, Hall enters the hotel and discovers that it is run by a strange and eccentric couple that talks about daylight saving time and the town's history of murder. V appears in the window, only for the female hotel owner to shoo her away. V bites her, which prompts Hall to run outside after V and find her threatening a priest by saying that he \\"knew what [he] did\\". Hall continues to follow V and runs into Edgar Allan Poe (Ben Chaplin), who guides him back to town. The next morning Hall wakes and, inspired, decides that he would like to collaborate with Bobby on his proposed story, which would center around vampires. Bobby invites Hall to his home, which contains a miniature model of a machine that would drive a stake into a vampire's heart. Hall is informed that Bobby believes that the machine would be good in the story, which he wants to name The Vampire Executions. Despite Bobby's input, Hall finds himself faced with writer's block and accepts several sleeping pills from Bobby in hopes of finding further inspiration from his dreams. Hall succeeds in once again entering the dream version of the town, where he meets Poe again. A series of visions imply that V was molested by the town's priest, who takes in orphans out of fear of them joining Flamingo (Alden Ehrenreich), leader of the people across the lake, who are believed to be vampires. In the waking world Hall's world begins to unravel as several strange occurrences begin to mirror the experiences he had in the dream world, such as Bobby talking about how he believes that teenagers gathering at the town's lake are \\"evil\\" and \\"asking for it\\". This prompts Hall to look strangely at Bobby, who knocks Hall unconscious. In the dream world Hall learns that the priest had drugged and murdered all the children in order to keep them from joining Flamingo at the lake. V managed to briefly survive, but was chased down and murdered by the priest. Ashamed of his actions, the priest hangs himself. Hall realizes that his writer's block is the result of a form of guilt over his daughter's death in a boating accident, as he had been too drunk to accompany her that morning. Working through his emotions, Hall writes a story where V survives the priest's assaults and is rescued by Flamingo. Hall wakes up in his room to find that Bobby has left. He goes to the sheriff's office, only to find that the deputy has been murdered and that Bobby has hanged himself, leaving a note that says \\"Guilty\\". Upset, Hall goes down to the morgue to look at the murder victim's face, only to discover that it is V's body and that she had been impaled with a stake. Hall removes the stake from her chest, at which point V awakens and attacks him with a new set of elongated fangs. The screen then cuts to Hall's publisher, Sam Malkin (David Paymer), setting down a new manuscript and telling Baltimore that he loves the story (implying everything from the first dream sequence up to this point has been the manuscript itself) and sees a whole new series ahead for Baltimore that will make him more popular than ever. Post-film text reveals that the series was moderately popular, LaGrange's murder was never solved and that Flamingo was never seen or heard from again.

But then > some loud noise outside woke me up, and I wanted to go back to the dream and > get an ending.

I realized that it was a gothic > romance setting, so in fact I'd be able to do it all around my home base, > rather than have to go to a distant country. =Filming and post-production= Twixt was filmed at Coppola's estate in Napa County as well as locations in Lake County, California, including the City of Clearlake, downtown Kelseyville and Nice. Musician Dan Deacon scored the film. The film's name was changed from Twixt Now and Sunrise to Twixt, and scenes from it were played at the July 2011 San Diego Comic-Con International. Release Twixt was screened solely at film festivals in North America as it was a featured film at the November 2011 American Film Market. The film received a general theatrical release in a handful of international markets. Reception Critical reception for Twixt has been predominantly negative and the film currently holds a rating of 29% \\"rotten\\" on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based upon 17 reviews. Reviewers have criticized the film for being \\"flimsy\\" and \\"[close to] unwatchable\\". The Hollywood Reporter panned Coppola's dream sequences in Twixt, commenting that the \\"young Coppola\\" could have done more with the scenes while \\"the present-day [Coppola] produces only tepid and tired imagery that would not earn high marks in any film school.\\" In contrast, Le Monde, Variety and Les Cahiers du cin√©ma gave the film positive reviews, and Variety praised Twixt as a \\"disarmingly cheeky, intermittently gorgeous trifle\\". French film magazine Cahiers du cin√©ma placed it as the third best film of 2012.

While not prosecuted for obscenity, the film was seized and confiscated in the UK under Section 3 of the Obscene Publications Act 1959 during the video nasty panic. Plot In ancient Egypt during the fourth millennium BC, slave raiders abduct several villagers to be servants for the burial of Pharaoh Sefirama. They were then ordered to stand around the Pharaoh's sarcophagus, killed with poison gas, and the entrance to his tomb was sealed. The high priestess (Laila Nasr) who attended the burial proclaims that \\"he who enters this tomb, after it is sealed, will die on the dawn of the mummy\\". Thousands of years later in the present day, three men, Rick (Barry Sattels), Tariq (Ali Gohar), and Karib (Ibrahim Khan) detonate the tomb and uncover its entrance. Rick warns the other two to wait until the next morning, as the air around the uncovered tomb is poisoned. The high priestess, now an elderly woman, screams and tells them that the tomb is cursed, but is scared off when Rick shoots his pistol at the air. Rick tells them to guard the tomb for the night, and drives away on his Jeep. That evening, three local grave robbers arrive riding on camels and are greeted by the old woman, who tells them to close the tomb to prevent its curse. They ask her and enter the tomb, but get infected by its poisonous gases. One of them dies, while the other two escape. A photographer and a group of American models travel to Egypt for a fashion shoot. On the way to the tomb, a tire on one of their Jeeps gets punctured, so the group has to stop to replace the tire. One of the models, Lisa (Brenda Siemer Schieder) asks the director, Gary (John Salvo), to look at the other side of a dune. They race to the bottom of the other side, but Lisa falls and gets scared by one of the grave robbers' severed heads lying on the sand. The rest of their group takes them back to their location. Rick and his group return to the tomb and explore its burial chamber, though Rick's henchmen were disappointed that there is no gold. Ahamed Zaiki (Ahmad Labab), a local businessman, arrives to check on his investments in the excavations, and after Rick's assurances, he leaves. The next morning, Rick attempts to chisel a passage into the chamber, but Tarak and Karib detonate its entrance with more dynamite. Even though they were disappointed again by the chamber's lack of gold, they open Sefirama's sarcophagus to look for more treasures. A mouse jumps unto Karib's back, and frightens him. After settling near a riverbank village for the night, the American models' group moves on next morning to shoot photos near the tomb. Karib shoots his gun at them, thinking that they are intruders, but Rick and Tarak stop him. The models' group proceeds on to the tomb, against Rick and his henchmen's objections. While doing so, their hot lights accidentally revive Pharaoh Seferman's mummy. Rick snaps off the cable on one of their spotlights. Jenny is asked to go and find a battery for their spotlights, but she spills a bowl containing one of the Pharaoh's organs, infecting her hand and frightening her. Their hot lights accidentally revive Pharaoh Seferman's mummy and his followers, a band of flesh-eating zombies. Tariq is left to return to his home in a city, while Jenny's hand infection persists and burns her. Karib enters the tomb alone by himself, cuts open Pharaoh Sefirama's mummy, and steals his crook and flail. A door to another chamber opens. Karib enters, but is incapacitated by the door, and dragged away. In the next morning, Rick and Tariq enter the tomb as they search for Karib, and are overjoyed to find Pharaoh Sefirama's crook and flail, and other treasures. The models and their team return for another photo shoot, but their continued usage of lighting has awakened the Pharaoh. At a campfire that night, the group of models sing along. The team finds the bodies of the two Bedouin grave robbers whose heads are crushed. Rick arrives and tells the team they should leave. The photographer, named Bill, says he needs one more day to shoot and then they will leave. Meanwhile, the old woman/high priestess goes into the tomb and finds the mummy gone. The mummy appears and kills the old woman. At dawn, Seferaman's army rises out of the sand. The next day, Bill is still taking pictures of the site and says they need 48 hours more to shoot. One of the models gets lost in the tomb. Meanwhile, Gary and Ahmed to go town for a rest. Another local named Omar (Ahmed Rateb) gives Jenny and Gary a \\"smoke\\". Jenny goes shopping and sees Rick. Jenny sees the mummy and gets hysterical and runs to Gary, but when he looks, the mummy is gone. Back at the tomb, the mummy chops one of the tomb raiders head. At the nearby oasis, two models, Lisa and Melinda, take a swim. Melinda gets out of the water and takes a walk where she runs into the mummy and one of his \\"soldiers\\" where they kill Melinda by biting and tearing out her throat. The next day, Rick finds Tariq dead and drives away. Rick goes to the tomb and calls for the God of the Sun. A wall slides back and Rick finds the treasure. He screams in delight, but the mummy returns and kills Rick. Bill and Gary go to town to see Omar where he is celebrating his wedding. Gary gives Omar his western cowboy hat and Omar gives Gary his golden head covering. Back at the camp, Lisa looks around the tomb. Bill finds the gold in the tomb and calls out. Suddenly, Rick's severed head falls from the ceiling and lands in Bill's arms. He flees back to the camp running from the mummy's \\"soldiers.\\" Bill shoots the mummy with a gun, but to no effect. The mummy strangles and tears off Bill's head. The models run and scream. Jenny gets torn apart and eaten alive by the mummy's \\"soldiers\\" while the two remaining models flee in a jeep. Back at the wedding celebration in town, there is dancing in the streets and the mummy's \\"soldiers\\" are seen eating a female guest in a tent. At this point, climactic carnage ensues as everyone runs and the mummy soldiers grab and bite and kill many people in the street. The mummy is standing in the street looking at the carnage. The two surviving models, Lisa and June, arrive and throw sticks of dynamite at the mummy with little effect. The models go into a shack, spread gasoline, light a fuse in a box of dynamite and blow up the shack with the mummy in it. Lisa and June celebrate when Gary arrives and they all walk away. But in the final shot, the mummy's hand rises from the rubble.

Unlike traditional interpretations of mummies in cinema, the film's portrayal of the undead is quite unique. In the film the mummies are portrayed as ravenous flesh eaters, similar to the popular portrayal of zombies in which both share many similarities. Due to the film's surprisingly graphic content the film was subject to several cuts in the UK in order to trim down the film's more graphic scenes, approximately 1 minute and 43 seconds were cut from 12 different scenes in the film. Some scenes included The Mummy ramming a machete into the character Tarak's head, a man being gutted by the mummy, and scenes where the mummy's undead servants feast on several characters.  Release  =Home media = Dawn of the Mummy has been released on VHS and DVD format. The film was released on region 1 by Madacy Entertainment, as a VHS transfer. The packaging is said to list the film's Theatrical Trailer and other Theatrical Trailers, although there is only one on the disc, it is not for the main feature, it is of a 1997 film, Road Ends. It does however feature an audio commentary track by director Frank Agrama. The film was released uncut in the UK by Anchor Bay Entertainment. It features an anamorphic widescreen 1.77:1 transfer, plus the 4:3 full screen transfer, DTS Digital Surround, Dolby Digital 2.0 & 5.1 Surround. The extras include Director's Audio Commentary, Stills Gallery, Production Notes and Trailer. Reception The film has received mixed to negative reviews from critics. John Stanley awarded the film 2 / 4 stars stating, \\"Hashish smokers in a Cairo square are as exciting as it gets in this tale\\". Popcorn Pictures.com gave the film 6/10 stating, \\"It is an arduous struggle to get past the first half of Dawn of the Mummy but stick with it and you‚Äôll be rewarded with one of the more entertaining zombie flicks of its period: a guilty pleasure of trashy exploitation at its finest. If the entire film had been as enjoyable as the last half, you‚Äôd be looking at a bonafide classic right here\\". It was awarded a score of 0 / 4 by VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever which panned the film's plot and acting. Remake Anthony Hickox wrote 2012 the script of the remake Prisoners of the Sun, which directed by Roger Christian and stars Joss Ackland, Carmen Chaplin, Nick Moran and John Rhys-Davies. The film will release in April 2015 in the United Kingdom on DVD and Blu-ray.

The Church is part of the Orlando Diocese of Florida, as created by the Vatican. The parish population was made up of around 100 families at the start of the community in 2005, but as of 2017 is estimated to be more than 1,000 families. Church services in the area were first held at the Celebration K8 School and then later at Celebration High School cafeteria, but construction of the new church was completed on December 24, 2009. The new church was dedicated on Saturday, January 16, 2010 with Bishop Thomas Wenski of the Orlando Diocese presiding.\\"Orlando Diocese Report\\" The new church construction follows a stunning, classical-style building inside and out that not only fits well with the architectural pattern established by The Celebration Company, but also becomes an attractive, prominent landmark of the community of Celebration Florida. The church was designed by Cooper Johnson Smith Architects & Town Planners. Groundbreaking for the church was held in November 2008, though construction did not begin in earnest until the following January. Brasfield & Gorrie, the general contractor for the project and a Fortune 500 company, kept up a steady pace, especially in the last three weeks when the seating, altar art, and stained glass windows were installed. As a consequence, pastor Father Gregory Parkes, was able to celebrate the first Mass in the new building on December 24 morning to a nearly full house of excited parishioners from not only Celebration, but also Orlando, Kissimmee, and the entire Four Corners area. In a ceremony beforehand outside the front doors, Tim Dwyer of Brasfield & Gorrie handed the keys over to Building Committee Chairman Jack Blitch, who in turn presented them to Father Gregory. After humbly thanking the Committee, Father Gregory acknowledged the hard work and support of the trades people, the Parish, and the Town. Fortunately, everything worked relatively smoothly at that first mass. Seven hours later, the Church hosted an overflow crowd for its 5 pm Christmas Eve Mass that featured the Children's Choir. Father Gregory opened the liturgy with a greeting and then the rhetorical exclamation, ‚ÄúCan we give glory and praise to God for this beautiful church?‚Äù Even without any advertising or notices in the neighboring hotels, the turnout for the four Christmas Eve and Christmas Day Masses was remarkable. Today the church is led by Fr. Richard W. Trout, Jr., Pastor. Corpus Christi continues to make every attempt to live up to its mission statement: As a welcoming faith community, centered in the Eucharist and guided by the Holy Spirit to do God's will, we seek to spread the Good News of Jesus Christ by being good stewards of God's gifts and blessings, thus giving glory and praise to Him.

Obstetrical nurses help provide prenatal care and testing, care of patients experiencing pregnancy complications, care during labor and delivery, and care of patients following delivery. Obstetrical nurses work closely with obstetricians, midwives, and nurse practitioners. They also provide supervision of patient care technicians and surgical technologists. Obstetrical nurses perform postoperative care on a surgical unit, stress test evaluations, cardiac monitoring, vascular monitoring, and health assessments. Obstetrical nurses are required to possess specialized skills such as electronic fetal monitoring, nonstress tests, neonatal resuscitation, and medication administration by continuous intravenous drip. Obstetrical nurses are also expected to be detailed and organized because they usually have more than one patient to deal with at a time. Their mental and physical strength is important because the nurses work long hours usually standing and also have to be able to perform tasks expertly. Nurses should be emotionally stable because they will have to cope with emergencies and loss. Lastly, they need to have critical thinking skills because the patient's health could change in an instant and they have to be ready to know what to do quickly and accurately. Obstetrical nurses work in many different environments such as medical offices, prenatal clinics, labor & delivery units, antepartum units, postpartum units, operating theatres, and clinical research. In the U.S. and Canada, the professional nursing organization for obstetrical nurses is the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nursing (AWHONN).  Certification for obstetrical nurses  The National Certification Corporation (NCC) offers certifications for obstetrical nurses. These include RNC-OB (Inpatient Obstetrics), a certification that allows graduate nurses who have completed a bachelor's degree in the US or Canada, who want to expand into obstetrics. It is an online exam that costs around $325, and by the end of it they will gain themselves RNC-OB certificates. RNC-MNN (Maternal Newborn Nursing) is another online exam that is for certified registered nurses, who have completed their bachelor's degrees in Nursing and have gained experienced in the area of newborn nursing, and are wanting to gain a certification/qualification in the area. The test costs around $325 and they have a 90-day window to complete the actual exam and C-EFM (Electronic Fetal Monitoring). This certification like the other two is an online citification exam, for US and Canadian graduate nursing students. To do the online certification they are required to be either a licensed registered nurse, nurse practitioner, nurse midwife, physician, physician assistant, or paramedic, according to the US and Canada requirements.  Australian certification and requirements  Bachelor's degrees in either nursing and/or midwifery are required to become an obstetrical or perinatal nurse in Australia. In Australia alone there are 32 different universities that offer nursing as an undergraduate degree, such as Australian Catholic university, Charles Darwin University and the University of Notre Dame in Australia. Once completing their degree, they are required to complete their master's degree in nursing. Bachelor's degrees and jobs as licensed nurses/midwives are required in order to be accepted for the master's degree. There are 24 different universities in Australia that offer a master's degree in nursing, including Edith Cowan University, Monash University, James Cook University and University of Canberra.

Cuandixia (), also spelled Chuandixia (), is a historic village dating from the Ming dynasty located in Zhaitang (), Mentougou District in Beijing, China. It is a popular tourist attraction known for its well preserved courtyard homes. Overview Cuan (Áà®) means \\"cooking-stove\\" in Chinese. In the year 1958, it was simplified as Chuan (in Chinese: Â∑ù). The reason why this hamlet has this name is that the host would like to be away from chill. It is famous because it has a history of 400 years during the Ming Dynasty. At that time, Cuandixia's settlers migrated from Shan Xi, a province west of Beijing. It is a stronghold on the way from Beijing to Shan Xi. The family name of all of the villagers living here is Han (Èü©/Èüì), which means that they share the same ancestor. Hundreds of years old, the houses here still maintain the style of Ming and Qing Dynasty. Therefore, it is an attractive historical site, where thousands of people come here from its surrounding cities. There are 500 houses left. Stone carving, brick carving, calligraphy, and painting are everywhere. Common figures used are bats, pied magpies, Peonies, waterlilies, etc. Each of them has its typical meaning. The site is a National Village Architecture Reserve. Location Cuandixia is located on ancient post road roughly 90 km northwest from central Beijing in the Jingxi mountain region. The village is served by National Road 109 and can be reached via bus number 929 which departs from Pingguoyuan subway station. Travel from central Beijing takes about three hours by car. History Cuandixia was founded during the Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644) by members of the Han clan who moved from Shanxi Province.The Ancient Village Chuandixia in Beijing Towards the end of the Qing Dynasty Cuandixia prospered from trading in coal, fur, and grain. Attractions Cuandixia is home to 500 well preserved courtyard homes dating to the Ming and Qing dynasties. Many of these homes have been converted into inns offering food and lodging to travelers. Stone paved lanes and steep staircases help define Chuandixia's architectural identity. The village is a frequent subject of photographers and painters. The surrounding area is full of mountains and trails for hikers.

He was the Democratic Party nominee for Governor of Mississippi in 2011.http://blog.gulflive.com/mississippi-press- news/2011/08/dupree_luckett_face_off_in_dem.html He was the first African- American major party nominee for Governor in Mississippi since the Reconstruction era. On February 19, 2019, DuPree announced his candidacy for Secretary Of State. Early life Johnny DuPree was born in Fort Benning, Georgia. As a small boy, he moved to Hattiesburg, Mississippi, with his mother, brother, and sister. DuPree is a member of Omega Psi Phi fraternity. Career DuPree entered public service in 1987 when he was appointed to the Hattiesburg Public School Board. A year later, he and his wife established a small business in real estate. In 1991, he was elected to the Forrest County Board of Supervisors where he served for 10 years before running for mayor of Hattiesburg in 2001. Mayor of Hattiesburg In 2001, DuPree became the first African-American mayor of Hattiesburg after winning 53% of the vote. He was re-elected twice in the next decade. During his first campaign for mayor, DuPree ran on a platform of shoring up education and protecting small business.Gillette, Becky. \\"Mayor-elect says small business economy's 'backbone'.\\" Mississippi Business Journal 23, no. 27 (July 2, 2001): 16. At the time, Robert Ingram, the executive director of economic development at the University of Southern Mississippi, predicted that DuPree would support locally owned small business while also being active in industrial recruitment. Despite damage to the city resulting from Hurricane Katrina and a global recession, the health of Hattiesburg's small businesses remained steady during DuPree's tenure as mayor. Ingram's predictions for Hattiesburg under the DuPree administration were largely accurate.http://msbusiness.com/2010/05/healthcare-education-military-stirs- economy/ In 2010, employment statistics showed Hattiesburg registering only 8.6 percent at a time when the state unemployment rate was 11.2 and the national rate was 11.1. Also during DuPree's tenure as mayor, annual crime statistics released by the Hattiesburg Police Department in showed a 10 percent overall decrease in reported crime since 2008. Response to Katrina On the Sunday before Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast in 2005, DuPree was invited to address the congregation of Mt Carmel Baptist Church, where he warned the congregation about the \\"devastation churning its way across the Gulf of Mexico.\\" Adderton, Donald. \\"In Katrina's Aftermath, don't forget Mississippi\\" Herald News (September 6th, 2006):d04 In the aftermath of the storm, the city lost power and water for several days.Conan, Neal, and Robert Smith. \\"Hurricane Katrina Coverage.\\" NPR News Special Coverage 3:00 AM EST NPR. NPR, 9 3, 2005. Due to the lack of a response from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the city under DuPree resorted to leasing essential equipment and goods on its own, items such as generators, which would normally be available through federal and state emergency services. Because of Hattiesburg's position as a regional hub and as the first major metropolitan area outside of New Orleans, the city was flooded with thousands of evacuees. In the immediate aftermath of the storm, DuPree's government worked to meet the needs of the displaced evacuees without assistance from federal agencies. In the weeks following Katrina, DuPree was a vocal critic of FEMA's inept performance and perceived indifference. Although the federal response to the Katrina disaster resulted in many high-profile accusations of racism, DuPree was among those who emphasized the role of income disparity. He also stated that \\"those charged with providing to those in need simply failed when called upon.\\" Elections In the Democratic primary of the 2011 Mississippi gubernatorial election, DuPree faced businessman and future Clarksdale mayor Bill Luckett and two minor candidates. Despite a significant fundraising disadvantage, on August 23, 2011, DuPree defeated Luckett by 179,748 votes (43.6%) to 161,833 (39.2%). He lost to Republican nominee Phil Bryant in the general election on November 8, 2011. In the 2013 mayoral election, DuPree faced fourth ward councilman Dave Ware, a Republican who ran as an independent, along with three minor candidates in his bid for a fourth term as mayor. In the June 4 election, DuPree was believed to be the winner by 37 votes out of over 9,600 cast, but concerns were raised about possible voter fraud, eligibility of some voters, and the fact that the city clerk left ballots unsecured in city hall the night before the election. Ware filed an election challenge on June 24, and a special judge was appointed by the state Supreme Court to hear the case. The jury initially found in favor of Ware in a 9-3 vote, the bare minimum for a verdict, however after Judge William Coleman polled the jurors, the count shifted to 8-4 and a mistrial was declared. After a new election was ordered, another dispute arose over choosing replacements for two election commissioners who resigned. Ultimately, a clean slate of commissioners was chosen to oversee the special election. On election day, one precinct's ballot box was returned unsealed and, despite state law stating boxes must be locked and sealed at the precinct, the ballots were counted anyway. In the end, DuPree again narrowly bested Ware, this time by a margin of 217 votes. In 2017, DuPree was defeated in a bid for a fifth consecutive term as mayor, losing to Toby Barker, a Republican member of the state House of Representatives who ran as an independent. In 2019, DuPree ran for Secretary of State of Mississippi. He lost the election to Michael Watson.https://www.mdjonline.com/ap/state/the-latest-mcrae-wins-treasurer-s- race-on-nd-attempt/article_b3e6b05b-77e3-5d94-9ff9-866e98c7b185.html Personal life DuPree has been married to Johniece since 1972. They have two daughters, April and Monica and two grandsons, Chandler DuPree Taylor and Chesney DuPree Taylor.

It is the capital of Pakxan District. The Nam Xan River joins the Mekong River at Pakxan on the border with Thailand, opposite Bueng Kan. Pakxan is connected to the south of Laos by Route 13. History Pakxan was founded in the late-19th century. The Pakxan region had experienced insecurity since the invasion by Annam in 1834, followed by invasions by the Siamese, and Siamese sovereignty over Laos in 1836, and especially after 1865 with the invasions of Haws or \\"red flags\\", gangs from southern China. These invasions began to reduce the populations of Xieng Khouang and Bolikhamsai, but it was the Siamese who completed the depopulation by deporting most of the Phou Eun inhabiting the region.Jean- Louis Archet, Formes et r√©sultat des activit√©s du monde rural dans le Koueng Borikhane (Laos), m√©moire de g√©ographie du sous-d√©veloppement, Universit√© de Provence, Aix-en-Provence, 1973, p.16-17 In 1876, Rama V, King of Siam, ordered the creation of Bolikhamsai with the last survivors of the Haw invasion of 1874. Bolikhamsai was placed under the authority of Kha Luang Nong Khai. From 1885, the French who took over neighboring Vietnam, challenged Siamese sovereignty over Laos, and after Auguste Pavie's mission dating the Mekong to Luang Prabang, the Siamese were forced to leave the left bank of Mekong and evacuate the position they had created at the mouth of the Nam Xan River. At that time, Patchoum Muong (or Paxum) was the largest town near the confluence of the Nam Xan, but it is on the Nam Xan, a half-day by boat up the Mekong. In the course of the 1890s, missionaries of the Missions √©trang√®res de Paris, attached to the mission of Christianity to a Bangkok-based Keng-Sadok, on the Mekong River, a few miles from the mouth of the Nam Xan. Then the missionaries occupied Pakxan, abandoned by the Siamese, and there built a church. [4] In 1911, Bolikhamsai had about 61 villages with a population of about 4,000 inhabitants. In 1937, when Vientiane Province was cut in half, Pakxan alone had a population of 1,000 people and became the capital of the new province.

This sport is very similar to team handball.  History  Czech handball is first mentioned by V√°clav Karas, a teacher a Prague, in a sports journal in Brno in 1905. The rules were soon further developed by other teachers, notably Klenka and Kristof. Thanks to Kristof, the first Czech handball association was established (in Prague) and the rules were made public in 1908. Students from Russia and Yugoslavia, who had become acquainted with Czech handball in Prague, brought this sport back to their own countries. In Yugoslavia, the sport expanded fast and became very popular. Czech teachers taught Czech handball in Russian middle schools and there was a competition with 14 teams in Charkov in 1915, but efforts to expand the sport ended after the October Revolution. In 1921, the Czechoslovakian Association of Handball and Women's Sports became a member of the International Women's Sports Federation. In this federation, the rules of Czech handball were made official (in those times, there was also one similar sport, Field handball in Germany. Some international federations preferred Czech handball, others preferred Field handball). The first international matches were played. The first women's Czech handball world cup was organised in 1930. Czechoslovakians won this competition, Yugoslavia came in second, and Poland was third. The second World Cup was held in London in 1934, but only two teams participated: Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia. Yugoslavians won the match 6-4 and became the champions. This was the first time that Czech handball was played in England. After this event, the IWSF was abolished. In 1935, there was a training camp for English teachers in Scarborough. 50 female and 20 male players ptractised the ‚Äúgame of hazena‚Äù, the first ever English players. Further training was planned in London. The netball and other ball sports' association organised the printing and publishing of the rules of Czech handball. The Civil Service Club in London was the first Czech handball club in Britain. Czech handball became very popular during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in World War II. The sport was originally Czech, so most people understood its play as a show of patriotism. In early 1940s, there were 25,884 players in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. In 1947, the International Handball Federation promoted the expansion of the related sport of team handball, but no further foreign countries would adopt Czech handball. In 1954, there were 26,125 registered players in 447 clubs, the largest number of registered player to date. Since 1941, a men's and women's 1st league have been competing. There is also the men's 2nd league and regional championships.  Rules  The rules are quite similar to those of team handball, but there are also some major differences: * size of the field: 45 √ó 30 meters * size of the goal: height 240 cm, width 200 cm * size of the ball: 580 to 605 mm * the field is divided into three areas: defence third, middle third, offense third * player positions are called: goalkeeper (1), defender (1), halfback (2), forward (3) * the player cannot hold the ball longer than three seconds, he or she can throw the ball upon the head or bounce ball back off ground - maximum of two times, no limit in steps * shooting on the goal is made in front of the goal area - leaning out or jumping is possible, but the fall has to be outside the goal area * goalkeeper and defender can step into their own goal area; forwards can step in the opponent's goal area, but they cannot shoot from there * defender and halfbacks cannot step in the offense third, forwards cannot step in the defense third, and there are some more rules for crossing between the thirds * players may be sent off for five (single yellow) or ten minutes (double yellow) External links *Czech handball federation (cz) *Short video *Video from final tournament of the Czech Cup Category:Handball Category:Games and sports introduced in 1905 Category:20th-century establishments in Bohemia ","title":"Czech handball"},{"id":"29499734","text":"River House Condominiums is a residential skyscraper built on the west bank of the Grand River in downtown Grand Rapids, Michigan located next to Bridgewater Place. It is the tallest building in Grand Rapids, the tallest all-residential building in Michigan, and the tallest building in the state outside of Detroit.  Building features  Seven floors of the building are dedicated to indoor parking, and there is an additional parking ramp attached to the building.Ellis Parking  Building history  =Developer sales= The first homeowner occupancy occurred in November 2008. Nearly 140 of the initial 207 units (condos/penthouses) were under contract pre-construction, but 56 would- be condo buyers backed out of their contract following personal financial hardship and were sued by the developer. Those units were turned back to the developer following a nonbinding ruling on the contracts by Kent County Circuit Judge Donald Johnston due to a technicality in the purchase agreements drafted by Varnum law firm. Following the overturned contracts, reduced prices and sales promotions served as the catalyst to sell condos even at a loss for the developer. 90% of the units were sold by December 2011 triggering a full transfer of power from the Developer to the Homeowners Association. By the end of 2012, 198 units were sold. Due to the combining of some condos or penthouses by buyers, the total number of units was reduced from 207 to 205. =Community events= Rappelling down the front of the building was offered as a fund-raiser for Michigan Community Blood Centers prior to the completion of construction during Celebration on the Grand. A repeat event occurred June 9, 2009 but has not happened since. Prior to their initial sale, some larger condos were used as small concert venues for a few big-name bands prior to their performances at Van Andel Arena or DeVos Place Convention Center. These events included the Bare Naked Ladies and American Idol listening parties with guest appearances by Jason Castro, Allison Iraheta, and others. 50 Cent (Curtis Jackson), filmed a scene for his movie, \\"The Gun\\" in a River House penthouse.

Schmidt Building, is a historic building located in downtown Davenport, Iowa, United States. It was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. In 2020 it was included as a contributing property in the Davenport Downtown Commercial Historic District. History  The building was built by Fritz T. Schmidt in 1896 to house his wine and liquor business, which was known as Fritz T. Schmidt and Sons. They produced their own wine at a west end location known as \\"Blackhawk Vineyards.\\" It was located along Blackhawk Creek. with Some of the buildings, including the Schmidt's house, are extant. During Prohibition the family moved into real estate and insurance. In the late 1970s and 1980s the building housed an upscale restaurant called J.K. Frizbee's. Duck City, another upscale restaurant, occupies the building now. Architecture The Schmidt Block is a three-plus story building constructed of red stone that was built on a brick foundation. The main fa√ßade was designed in the Romanesque Revival style made popular by Henry Hobson Richardson. It features large round-arched windows with tuned-stone surrounds on the third floor, roughly dressed stone, and stunted columns on the attic level arcade that are topped by a cornice. The Schmidt Block is the only commercial building in Davenport to adopt the Richardsonian Romanesque style in stone. The swag embellishments on the frieze are also unique in that they are Adamesque rather than Romanesque. While the storefront has been modernized, the building retains its recessed entrance into the first-floor commercial space and transom signage. The building immediately to the east has since been torn down and a sheltered outdoor seating area for the restaurant has been added that looks over the urban style park that sits between the Schmidt Block and the RiverCenter, the city's convention center.

Ebrahim is a South African legal case.  State v. Ebrahim, 1991 (2) SALR 553  In Ebrahim, two men identifying themselves as South African police officers seized a South African member of the military wing of the anti- apartheid African National Congress in Swaziland in December 1986. Ebrahim was bound, gagged, blindfolded, and brought to Pretoria and charged with treason. Swaziland did not protest this abduction. Ebrahim argued that his abduction and rendition violated international law, and that the trial court was thus incompetent to try him because international law was a part of South African law. Invoking Roman-Dutch common law, the Court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to try a person brought before it from another state by means of state-sponsored abduction. These common law rules embodies fundamental legal principles, including \\"the preservation and promotion of human rights, friendly international relations, and the sound administration of justice.\\" The Court continued: :The individual must be protected from unlawful arrest and abduction, jurisdictional boundaries must not be exceeded, international legal sovereignty must be respected, the legal process must be fair towards those affected by it, and the misuse thereof must be avoided in order to protect and promote the dignity and integrity of the judicial system. This applies equally to the State. When the State is itself party to a dispute, as for example in criminal cases, it must come to court \\"with clean hands\\" as it were. When the State is itself involved in an abduction across international borders as in the instant case, its hands cannot be said to be clean. The Court also noted that \\"the abduction was a violation of the applicable rules of international law, that these rules are part of [South African] law, and that this violation of these rules deprived the trial court competence to hear the matter.\\" In a subsequent civil proceeding, Ebrahim was awarded compensation for the kidnapping.

Location  Manje≈æ is located close to downtown, in an area bounded by the Nemanjina (south), Resavska (west), Kralja Milana (north) and Svetozara Markoviƒáa streets (east). Northeast of the park is the small square of Cvetni Trg, to the east is the new Hilton Hotel, to the southeast are the kafana Manje≈æ, building of the National Bank of Serbia and the Slavija Square behind it. West of the park are military buildings, including future location of the Belgrade City Museum, right across the park, and the Yugoslav Ministry of Defence building, partially demolished in the 1999 NATO bombing of Serbia.  History  Modern park occupies the area which was a location of the Royal Cavalry Guard, or manje≈æ (from the French man√®ge), hence the name of the park. The compound originated from at least 1834, when Serbian building pioneer Nikola ≈Ωivkoviƒá (known as Had≈æi-Neimar), built the gunpowder magazine. In 1854 the magazine was relocated and the building of the Military Riding School was built instead, also after ≈Ωivkoviƒá's project. Horse stables were also built next to it. The Belgrade City General Ordinance Plan of 1923 envisioned the creation of a park instead. The Royal Cavalry Guard occupied the site until 1931 when the construction of the park began. It was finished by 1933. The designer was Aleksandar Krstiƒá, a pioneer of modern landscape architecture. The park is one of the few green areas within the city, built between the World wars in the classical style. It was originally named \\"His Majesty, Heir Apparent Peter.  Characteristics  The park has a regular rectangular shape. With two diagonal pathways, the park also functions as a significant corridor of pedestrian traffic. The park has an area of and a total of 253 trees of varying vitality. It accommodates several important sculptures, both commemorative and decorative. When Serbia and Poland signed the cultural cooperation between Serbian Ministry of Culture and Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage in 2010, a statue of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, the Polish-French composer and pianist, was unveiled to mark the 200th anniversary of his birth, marked across the world that year.Stranci i spomenici u Beogradu = Yugoslav Drama Theatre = Yugoslav Drama Theatre at night In the northern extension of the park is the Yugoslav Drama Theatre.

The first performance was held in January 1920. In July 1922 the building of the National Theatre was reconstructed but the old stable, popularly known as \\"Wooden man√®ge\\" continued to serve as a theatre until 1927 the building burned to the ground. In this period it was known as the \\"Theatre at Cvetni Trg\\". The construction of the new building began that same year. After the plan designed by the prominent Russian architect, Nikolay Krasnov, the new building was financed by the shareholders' funds. Academically conceived, the main fa√ßade was enlivened by the series of decorative architectural elements and allegoric sculptures, by the author Vojislav Ratimiroviƒá ≈†ikoparija, a Belgrade sculptor.Moderna arhitektura Beograda u osvit Drugog svetskog rata: sajam, stadion, logor\\" u Istorija umetnosti u Srbiji XX vek, tom 2.

From 1929 until 1931, it served as the theatre building (\\"The building on Vraƒçar\\") when the interior of the building was altered due to the temporary moving in of the National Assembly. The adaptation of building into the theatre was finished in 1947, projected by –ú–æmƒçilo N. Belobrk. The theatre burned again on 17 October 1997, due to the bad wirings, and was reopened as a highly modernized building with restored much of the old exterior, on 23 May 2003.Otvaranje Jugoslovenskog Dramskog Pozori≈°ta: U novom ruhu = Kafana Manje≈æ = Kafana Manje≈æ is located just across the Svetozara Markoviƒáa street. The original kafana was opened in 1922 under the name Kod tetka Jele (\\"Aunt Jela's\\"). In 1936 it changed name after the newly built park. For decades, the traditional Serbian kafana was considered quite a distinguished venue, visited by artists, politicians, politicians, officers and foreigners. The violinist Stefan Milenkoviƒá named Manje≈æ the \\"true Serbian kafana and soul of the city\\" while actor Rade ≈†erbed≈æija called it \\"a mirror of old, beautiful Belgrade, the one I wish to remember it\\". Still, the kafana was modernized in 2007 with the international cuisine added to the menu, it was even closed in 2013 and revived as a modern restaurant and hotel \\"Manje≈æ Exclusive Villa\\". As the venue was a collateral for the credit which wasn't paid off, in September 2018 the Expobank activated the mortgage insurance and the restaurant was listed for sale.

The representative edifice was built in 1899 after the design of . Originally, it served as the military barrack. Built during the rule of Alexander Obrenoviƒá, the building was considered one of the most beautiful in Belgrade at the time, and hosted the elite guards unit. It was \\"the pride of the throne\\" and was meant to celebrate the power of the Serbian army and its loyalty to the dynasty. However, it was the guards unit from this very barrack which conducted the May Coup in 1903 when the Obrenoviƒá dynasty was dethroned and King Alexander and Queen Draga were executed. The building was located in the Military Quarter of Belgrade, which stretched between the streets of Kneza Milo≈°a, Kralja Milana, Birƒçaninova and the Slavija Square. The quarter included the buildings of the Serbian General Staff, Military Academy, Officers Storehouse, Officers House and the Royal Cavalry Guard training ground, or the modern park area. In terms of architecture, ƒêorƒëeviƒá implemented the style of the German Ritter barracks. Hence, above the entry nigh arch of the cart gate there are two square-shaped towers. The entire entry section is indented, leaving a small piazetta where the musters can be organized. The fa√ßade is ornamented with the sculptures symbolizing knights in armours or coats of arms. During the Interbellum, the 7th Regiment was situated in it. In 1927 Ministry of the Army decided to upgrade the edifice by adding the third floor. They hired architect Bla≈æo Vukiƒáeviƒá Sarap, even though the original designer ƒêorƒëeviƒá was still alive.

Though he made an impression on those who met him and is mentioned in various period biographies, the details of his life and death are not well known and his one slim book of poems has received little recognition in his life or thereafter. Family Iwar and his sister were the only children of Rudolf Karl Louis Adolf von L√ºcken who died in Dresden in 1923. For this particular branch of the family - ancient Mecklenburg nobility going back to the 13th century - the line ends with Iwar. The absence of any details in the entry of Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels regarding his education, war service and occupation might lead one to suspect a \\"black sheep\\". Not much is known about his childhood, upbringing,and education. Later life Any information about L√ºcken's life during the 20s and 30s is fragmented and difficult to come by. He appeared to sustain himself on the diet of \\"nothing but art and literature\\", with the death of his father in Dresden in 1923 having no effect on his material circumstances given the family's attitude towards his lifestyle. L√ºcken was appreciated by no more than about a dozen discerning people in Vienna, Dresden, and Berlin. It seems reasonable to assume that at some stage he was staying in either of the two capitals. The writer Peter de Mendelssohn recalls that he once encountered L√ºcken sitting in the corner of a \\"K√ºnstlerkneipe\\" in Berlin, some time between 1927 and 1929 - he had no money apart from a few small coins which he had obtained by begging and kept in a cigarette box. It seems that he left Berlin for Paris in 1933 when the Nazis came to power. His last letter is written from Paris in May 1935, and mentions an ambition to take a part in a sail to Greece via Italy. It also mentions recent serious illness, and to judge by the deterioration in the handwriting it is even doubtful whether he would have been fit enough to travel. The exact circumstances of his death and the whereabouts of his grave are not known. =Description by Hoffmann= A description of Iwar von L√ºcken in the book by Edith Hoffmann on Kokoschka reads: \\"Iwar von L√ºcken was a Baltic aristocrat disowned by his family because he preached - and practised - Tolstoian principles; a poet and a man of great knowledge, whom poverty reduced to a Don Quixote-like appearance; while all the others cultivated a conscious dissimilarity from other people but were in fact comfortably connected with the bourgeois world which provided for their needs, L√ºcken, with his unworldliness, his extreme modesty, his love for children, his classical quotations, his old-fashioned politeness, his weakness for the bottle and his disreputable suits, was probably the last real Bohemian\\". Works It does not seem that von L√ºcken's literary output was very great, although according to people who knew him, much of what he did write, including dramas and essays, he destroyed. An edition of poems (Gedichte) by Iwar von L√ºcken was published in Berlin in 1928, it contained twenty-nine poems, most no longer than twenty lines, a number of which had already been previously published in literary magazines. Of this slim volume only two copies survived (both are in the libraries of Berlin). Influences The influence of H√∂lderlin is marked throughout L√ºcken's poetry: he has a predilection for such unrevolutionary subjects as innocence and experience, creativity, joy and pain, joy through suffering, life in Nature, life in feeling. There is no hatred or bitterness, little violence, and much positive delight is what is most natural, spontaneous, and most vibrantly alive.

It is about five million years old and roughly away from the Sun. Included within the cluster is a double star named Meissa. With the rest of Orion, it is visible from the middle of August in the morning sky, to late April before Orion becomes too close to the Sun to be seen well. It can be seen from both the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere. Description The cluster is following an orbit through the Milky Way that has a period of 227.4 million years with an ellipticity of 0.06, carrying it as far as from the Galactic Center, and as close as . The inclination of the orbit carries it up to away from the galactic plane. On average it crosses the plane every 33.3 million years. The star cluster is young and contains a large number of low-mass stars, some T Tauri stars and brown dwarfs. One notable member is LOri167, which is a wide binary consisting of a potential planetary- mass object and a brown dwarf. Observations of the star cluster with the Spitzer Space Telescope have shown that 25% of the low-mass stars and 40% of the substellar objects are surrounded by a circumstellar disk. Two of these being actively photoevaporated by Meissa.  Molecular ring and cluster evolution  Molecular Ring in infrared as seen by WISE The cluster might have formed in the central region of an elongated cloud, which is supported by the distribution of pre-main-sequence star candidates, which are concentrated in the cluster and nearby regions in an elongated shape. Massive OB stars and low-mass stars formed in the central regions of these clouds. The low-mass stars closest to the massive stars likely lost their circumstellar disks due to photoevaporation. Many low-mass stars parsecs away were unaffected by this and represent the current population of low-mass stars with a circumstellar disk. The cluster is surrounded by a large molecular ring, called the Lambda Orionis ring. This was interpreted as a remnant of a supernova that exploded one Million years ago. The supernova blast encountered the clouds and gas in the region and the blast dispersed the parent core, creating the molecular ring.

She is unaware that Alec has been to her campus and is now on the same train. A photographer snaps their picture getting off the train. Susan is livid, hits Alec with her purse and Teddy makes sure their spat makes the newspapers. Susan believes that Alec is a publicity seeker, rejecting his attempts to explain. Susan's dad takes a shine to Alec and wants to encourage her to find time for a love life. To get away, Susan takes her daughter to the family's cabin, but Mark also invites Alec there. The locket was given to Alec by a concentration camp prisoner named Benoit during the war. Alec tells her how he merely was attempting to bring it to her at the soldier's request. He and Susan attend a college dance, but another misunderstanding prompts her to leave with a student, who promptly gets Susan in trouble by drag-racing with another car. Teddy plants a story that Alec is the real father of Susan's little girl. Susan's job is now in jeopardy from the continuing bad publicity.

Overview Lambert was the son of Walter Lambert and Anne Eyre. He married Sarah Trousdell in August 1850, but died without issue. Lambert gained the rank of Captain in the service of the 38th Foot. He was at one time a Justice of the Peace (J.P.) in County Galway. He was a descendant of John Lambert of Creg Clare. Between 1869 and 1871 he was one of the principals in an attempted murder case which gained national and international attention. Eviction of the Barrett family Captain Lambert inherited his father's estate in 1867, at Castle Lambert, a few miles northwest of Athenry. In 1869 he evicted the Barrett family from their farm at Moorepark, close to Castle Lambert. Folklore in the Athenry area relates that during a hunt, a rider asked if Barrett's house was that of Lambert's brother, Thomas. On being told that it was actually the home of a peasant, the hunt members laughed. Shortly after this, the Barrett's were evicted, moving to Swangate in Athenry. News reached Peter Barrett, one of the family's older children, who was at the time working as a postman in London. The shooting On Sunday evening between 9pm and 10pm, 11 July 1869, Captain Lambert was walking up the avenue of Castle Lambert, returning from dinner at his brother's home in Moorepark. He encountered a man wearing a bowler hat in the shadow of lime trees. When Lambert asked the man to identify himself, the man remained silent, leading Lambert to set his small dog on him. At this the man faced Lambert, pointed a revolver and shot five bullets from no more than twelve yards. He then ran off through a group of trees called \\"The Rookery\\". Lambert had been shot twice in the stomach with another bullet in his forehead. If not for his hard hat, the bullet would have likely impacted his brain and killed him. Lambert rose, staggered towards his house and raised the alarm, with the local Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC), sealing off the Athenry area. Shortly before 10pm, Peter Barrett appeared at Athenry railway station, where he bought a ticket for London. He then proceeded across the road to the Railway Hotel, drawing attention by several requests to members of staff as to what time it was, despite the hotel clock being plainly visible. He was noted as wearing a tall hat. He stepped on the train bound for Dublin. Few policemen were in Athenry, as many had been relocated to Northern Ireland to deal with the usual 12 July disturbances, but sub-constable Hayden was alerted in time to board the train where he noticed Barrett. As he fitted the description given by Captain Lambert, he was arrested and taken off at Woodlawn station, between Athenry and Ballinasloe. The following morning he was identified by Captain Lambert as his attacker. Trial of Barrett The trial of Regina versus Barrett was held in Galway in September 1869. Barrett was defended by Isaac Butt, who proceeded to attack the prosecution case. Barrett had been searched but no sign of the revolver. Butt uncovered inconsistencies in Lambert's evidence, and scored a major victory when he determined that Lambert (a magistrate) had suppressed some crucial facts. His efforts were successful in undermining Lambert's credibility. The jury was unable to deliver a verdict, leading to a second trial being held in Dublin. By this stage, the media had given events detailed coverage and made the case front-page news, becoming a high-profile example of the Irish question, concerning both tenant's rights and Home Rule. For a second time, the jury could not give a unanimous verdict, leading to all charges against Barrett been dismissed. Other shootings In the mid-to-late 1800s, County Galway had an especially bad reputation concerning land disputes. Some incidents of the times included: * James Connors (Kiltullagh), shot March 1881. * Peter Dempsey (Kiltullagh), shot May 1881. * Maumtrasna murders of 1882, in which nine members of the Joyce family were shot to death. * John Henry Blake, shot June 1882.

Because of anatomical and physiological differences between children and adults the care and management of this population differs. Anatomic and physiologic differences There are significant anatomical and physiological differences between children and adults. For example, the internal organs are closer in proximity to each other in children than in adults; this places children at higher risk of traumatic injury. Children present a unique challenge in trauma care because they are so different from adults - anatomically, developmentally, physiologically and emotionally. A 2006 study concluded that the risk of death for injured children is lower when care is provided in pediatric trauma centers rather than in non-pediatric trauma centers. Yet about 10% of injured children are treated at pediatric trauma centers. The highest mortality rates occur in children who are treated in rural areas without access trauma centers. An important part of managing trauma in children is weight estimation. A number of methods to estimate weight exist, including the Broselow tape, Leffler formula, and Theron formula. Of these three methods, the Broselow tape is the most accurate for weight estimation in children ‚â§25 kg, while the Theron formula performs better with patients weighing >40 kg. Due to basic geometry, a child's weight to surface area ratio is lower than an adult's, children more readily lose their body heat through radiation and have a higher risk of becoming hypothermic. Smaller body size in children often makes them more prone to poly traumatic injury. Diagnosis =Pediatric Trauma Score= Several classification systems have been developed that use some combination of subjective and objective data in an effort to quantify the severity of trauma. Examples include the Injury Severity Score and a modified version of the Glasgow Coma Scale. More complex classification systems, such as the Revised Trauma Score, APACHE II, and SAPS II add physiologic data to the equation in an attempt to more precisely define the severity, which can be useful in triaging casualties as well as in determining medical management and predicting prognosis. Though useful, all of these measures have significant limitations when applied to pediatric patients. For this reason, health care providers often employ classification systems that have been modified or even specifically developed for use in the pediatric population. For example, the Pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale is a modification of the Glasgow Coma Scale that is useful in patients who have not yet developed language skills. Emphasizing the importance of body weight and airway diameter, the Pediatric Trauma Score (PTS) was developed to specifically reflect the vulnerability of children to traumatic injury. The minimal score is -6 and the maximum score is +12. There is a linear relationship between the decrease in PTS and the mortality risk (i.e. the lower the PTS, the higher the mortality risk). Mortality is estimated at 9% with a PTS > 8, and at 100% with a PTS ‚â§ 0. In most cases the severity of a pediatric trauma injury is determined by the pediatric trauma score despite the fact that some research has shown there is no benefit between it and the revised trauma scale. Management The management of pediatric trauma depends on a knowledge of the physiological, anatomical, and developmental differences in comparison to an adult patient, this requires expertise in this area. In the pre-hospital setting issues may arise with the treatment of pediatric patients due to a lack of knowledge and resources involved in the treatment of these injuries. Despite the fact there is only a slight variation in outcomes in adult trauma centers, definitive care is best reached at a pediatric trauma center. Epidemiology 250px Based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) WISQARS database for the latest year of data (2010), serious injury kills nearly 10,000 children in America each year. Pediatric trauma accounted for 59.5% of all mortality for children under 18 in 2004. Injury is the leading cause of death in this age group in the United States‚Äîgreater than all other causes combined. It is also the leading cause of permanent paralysis for children. In the US approximately 16,000,000 children go to a hospital emergency room due to some kind of injury every year. Male children are more frequently injured than female children by a ratio of two to one. Some injuries, including chemical eye burns, are more common among young children than among their adult counterparts; these are largely due to cleaning supplies and similar chemicals commonly found around the home. Similarly, penetrating injuries in children is because of writing utensils and other common household objects as many are readily available to children in the course of their day.

This release reached number 97 in the Billboard Hot 100. Both tracks were included on the 1988 compilation Past Masters. Composition The lyrics were translated to German language by Camillo Felgen, a Luxembourger singer, lyricist and television/radio presenter, upon request by EMI's German producer Otto Demler. Demler also asked Felgen to fly to Paris, where the Beatles were on tour, to work on the translations, and to teach them phonetically the new lyrics of their songs during a recording session. Felgen used \\"Jean Nicolas\\" as alias for his songwriting credit‚Äîhis full name was Camillo Jean Nicolas Felgen. Two other non-Beatles are credited, one \\"Lee Montague\\" on \\"\\", and a \\"Heinz Hellmer\\" on \\"\\". Lee Montague is the pen-name of Lawrence ‚ÄúLarry‚Äù M.

Recording The German sub-label of EMI, Odeon Records, persuaded George Martin and Brian Epstein, insisting that the Beatles \\"should record their biggest songs in German so that they could sell more records there.\\" Martin agreed to the proposal, and persuaded the Beatles to comply. In their only post-Parlophone-signing recording session outside the United Kingdom, the Beatles recorded Paul McCartney's new song \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\", and the German versions of \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" and \\"She Loves You\\", \\"\\" and \\"\\", respectively, on 29 January 1964 at EMI's Path√© Marconi Studios in Paris. The band was in France for a 19-day series of concerts at the Olympia Theatre. The recording session was scheduled for 27 January, but the Beatles were reluctant to attend it. \\"\\" was the first song to be recorded. The Beatles recorded eleven German vocal takes, so they were mixed with the original instrumental. The handclaps were overdubbed.

Female almost always with white discal spots on the forewing. Scent-scales of the male present. Larva unknown. Colombia to Bolivia, distributed eastwards to Para and Goyaz. The butterfly is individually and geographically variable; the females resemble the females of Aristolochia-Papilios and adopt in the different districts their likewise variable dress. The forms all intergrade,We differentiate 6 geographical forms, whether correctly must be ascertained by further investigations based on a larger material than we have seen.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church is considered to be \\"one of the best preserved examples of an early Georgian church in England\\". Clifton-Taylor includes the church in his list of 'best' English parish churches. History The earliest documentary evidence of the church is in 1126 when Eudo, Dean of Worcester, gave permission for the nearby Benedictine priory to build a church on his land. The resulting church was dedicated to Saint Swithun. The tower of the present church dates from the 15th century, but between 1734 and 1736 the rest of the church was rebuilt and the tower was refaced. The architects were Thomas and Edward Woodward of Chipping Campden. In the middle of the 19th century the east window was redesigned by Henry Eginton to accommodate new stained glass. In 1977 the church was declared redundant and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust. The church is now used as a venue for special services, ceremonies and concerts. A group has been formed, known as the Friends of St Swithun's, to help in the upkeep of the building and to encourage its use by the local community. Architecture =Exterior= While the former church was constructed in sandstone, the present church is built in oolitic limestone. Its classicising style is admixed with some Gothic Revival features. The plan consists of a six-bay rectangle with a west tower. The tower is in four stages, which are separated by string courses, and it has diagonal buttresses. At the west end is a doorway over which is a lintel, and a fanlight whose architrave contains Perpendicular tracery and whose keystone is carved with the head of a putto. Each of the upper stages contains two- light windows with mullions. Those in the second stage have leaded lights, those in the third stage are blind, and the top stage has louvred bell openings. At the summit of the tower is a balustrade and there are crocketted pinnacles at the corners. Each bay along the sides of the church contains a round-headed window, and between the bays there are Doric pilasters. The east end is in three bays, with the central bay projecting forwards. The bays are again separated by Doric pilasters. The central bay contains a Venetian window with Ionic pilasters. Above this window is a pediment, and over this is a clock. The outer bays each contain doorways and windows, both of which are round-headed. =Interior= The interior consists of a single cell with no division between the nave and the chancel. The roof is rib vaulted, and is decorated with roundels containing Gothic motifs and the heads of putti. The chancel contains a screen supported by four Doric columns. At the west end is a canted gallery supported by square fluted wooden pillars. Behind it sits the organ. All the windows contain leaded lights, other than the east window which has late 19th-century stained glass by Henry Eginton. The altar is made from wrought iron. On the right side of the nave is a three-decker wooden pulpit, which is reached by a spiral staircase. Above the pulpit is an elaborately carved tester with a crown supporting a pelican feeding her young. In front of the pulpit is a pew containing the elaborate mayor's chair and a sword rest, and throughout the rest of the church there are panelled box pews. The font is in a box pew to the right of the west entrance. It consists of a white marble bowl on a stem, with a mahogany cover. Around the church are a number of monuments, the oldest dating from 1627. The organ originally dates from 1736, but it has been modified since to create the current two-manual organ. The first modifications were made in about 1760, then more were carried out in 1795 by William and Robert Gray, in 1844 by John Nicholson, and in 1955, also though to be by Nicholson. In 2008, because of its historical importance, it was awarded a Grade I Certificate by the British Institute of Organ Studies and underwent a full restoration by Goetze and Gwynn in 2009-10. There is a ring of six bells. Three of these were cast locally in about 1420. The other three were cast by John Martin in 1654. There is another bell that is unused; it was cast by Abraham Rudhall II in 1720.

In 1926 the company developed and produced its first semi-diesel engines (10-60 hp, mostly for boat power). Soon an extended range of engine models, up to 120 hp, was developed and the company became one of the best known Greek engine makers, mostly remembered for the reliability of its products. Some exports were also made. Since 1952 focus shifted to metal products and in 1986 Dimadis-Kanakis was reorganized as Kanakis E.P.E.

After the pair became an item, Edmunds attended pre-season training with the Belles in 1984. When he criticised their methods, he was challenged to do better and found himself coaching at the club. Edmunds married Sheila in 1986 and took over as Doncaster Belles manager the following year. At the time Doncaster Belles were the pre-eminent women's football team in England, who reached 11 FA Cup finals out of twelve from 1983 to 1994.

He made his first appearance in the thirteenth series episode \\"Shifts\\", broadcast on 19 October 2010. Hanssen is initially a consultant general surgeon and the joint Director of Surgery of Holby City Hospital. He later becomes the sole Director of Surgery and the chief executive officer of the hospital trust. Henry has also appeared in Holby City sister show, Casualty, as Hanssen on multiple occasions. On 25 August 2013, Henry announced he had left Holby City after three years in the role and his on-screen departure aired on 8 October 2013. A year later, it was announced that Henry had chosen to return to his role and Hanssen's return scenes aired on 28 April 2015. Following his return, he has made several guest appearances in Casualty. Henry made a temporary departure in October 2016 and after a guest appearance on 3 January 2017, he returned on 7 February 2017. He made another temporary departure on 13 August 2019, and returned on 18 February 2020. Storylines =Holby City= Hanssen is introduced as the new joint Director of Surgery at Holby Hospital, working alongside Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing). In a meeting with the hospital board, he criticises Connie's plan to purchase a new MRI scanner for the cardiothoracic ward as being self- serving and na√Øve. He later informs the staff that budget cuts and redundancies will have to be made for the good of the hospital in a fraught economic climate. Hanssen considers making general surgeon Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie) redundant, as he is unable to perform clinical duties while undergoing chemotherapy. Connie defends Ric's position, and Hanssen allows her to make the final decision on redundancies, resulting in the dismissal of six nurses. Hanssen later grants Ric leave of absence to concentrate on his health. Before departing, Ric requests that Hanssen direct his budget cuts away from the general surgery department. After Connie's resignation from Holby City at the start of 2011, Hanssen becomes the sole Director of Surgery. He also assumes the position of CEO following the resignation of Mark Williams in January 2011, merging this role with his Director of Surgery duties. In March 2011, after attempting to move all Upper-GI surgical cases from Keller ward to St James' Hospital, undermining Ric in the process and causing Ric to form a mutiny with fellow members of staff, Hanssen offers to operate on Ric in a risky bid to remove his terminal cancer. Henrik's friendship with Sahira Shah (Laila Rouass), who he hires to Darwin Ward in early 2011, is frowned upon by many of his colleagues, who believe that he is favouring her. Sahira is able to make Hanssen see the error of his ways several times and seems to calm him. Her relationship with Greg Douglas (Edward MacLiam), another Darwin surgeon, leads to conflict between the pair, and the belief that Hanssen has feelings for Sahira. When the affair between Sahira and Greg comes out, Sahira leaves the hospital, and it is revealed Hanssen feels like Sahira is a daughter to him and is distraught by her departure. Serena Campbell (Catherine Russell) is hired as a new consultant on Keller Ward, and Hanssen finds himself trapped between her and Ric for several episodes. Later on Hanssen agrees with Serena's non-referral scheme and decides to pilot it. When Hanssen's decision costs a patient his life, the patient's unstable son takes Hanssen hostage; however, the scenario makes Hanssen realise that the NHS' current system is wrong and he campaigns against it. In the following weeks, the pressure from the board and the doubt cast by his colleagues causes Hanssen to depart Holby suddenly and without notice; Serena, and then Imelda Cousins (Tessa Peake-Jones), take up the position of temporary Director of Surgery. Following Serena's bidding, Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel) tracks Hanssen to Sweden. It is revealed that Hanssen disowned his father Anders L√∂vborg many years ago, due to Anders using data collected by the Nazis in his scientific research, which Hanssen believes was what led to his Jewish mother Elizabet's suicide. Hanssen then finds out that Elizabet wanted Anders to use the data so that her brother's death in the Holocaust wouldn't be pointless, and that the true reason she committed suicide was because she thought Anders was dead after his disappearance and she couldn't live without him. Now knowing the truth, Hanssen forgives his father and reunites with Anders on his deathbed. Hanssen agrees to return to Holby, to Serena's anguish, and quiets the board by making Serena his deputy. Hanssen becomes close to F1 Tara Lo (Jing Lusi) when he discovers she is practising with a brain tumour, he warns her that if any growth occurs in the tumour she will stop practising with immediate effect, Tara later begins to notice signs of growth but keeps it a secret. Hanssen organises CT scans to which she refuses to go to but later her boyfriend Oliver Valentine (James Anderson) finds a recent CT she had and informs Hanssen who tries to pull her out of theatre. Later he shows her the scan which confirms a 20% growth and with the support of Hanssen, Tara agrees to surgery to remove a large amount of the tumour but following complications in theatre she is pronounced brain-stem dead leaving Hanssen deeply upset. Hanssen mellows as he returns to the more hands on side of medicine, spending more time treating patients on the wards and developing his working relationships with colleagues. Hanssen departs Holby General quietly after turning over the role of CEO to Serena. Hanssen returns to Sweden where he reconciles with Maja Johansson (Pia Halvorsen), his former partner, and finally meets his son, Fredrik, and his newborn grandson. Over twenty months later, Hanssen's successor Guy Self (John Michie) steps down from the position and orchestrates a plan to bring in a new CEO who will persuade the board to fund his vision of a new neurology centre. Realising that Guy is manipulating both her and the board for his own ends, Serena takes action and makes a call to Hanssen who ultimately decides to return to Holby and takes the vacant CEO position. A rivalry develops between Hanssen and Guy, while he also shows his disdain towards Dominic Copeland (David Ames). Hanssen agrees to dress up as Santa so the children at the hospital are not let down after the hired Santa does not show up. Hanssen's son Fredrik arrives at the hospital Holby City, Series 19, \\"How Loud It Is\\" and clashes with his father. After weeks of arguing, Fredrik leaves but later returns with a gun, killing Raf di Lucca and severely wounding Oliver Valentine and Jac Naylor. Hanssen, along with the police, confronts Fredrik, who is then shot and dies. After Raf's memorial, Hanssen's mental health deteriorates and he takes a break from the hospital, calling on Serena who returns to Holby and takes charge in his absence. Roxanna MacMillan tells Hanssen that he should not be torturing himself, but he still takes responsibility for Fredrik's actions. Weeks later, Hanssen returns to the hospital and resumes his role as CEO. He visits Ollie, who asks where he has been. Hanssen gets angry at the idea of Ollie trying to retrain and return to work, and tells him that his brain has been damaged. Hanssen goes into theatre to perform an operation with Meena Chowdhury, Sacha Levy and Dom, while Ollie is taunting him. After surgery, Hanssen shouts at Ollie again. Meanwhile Fletch is refusing to write the proposal for Hanssen. Hanssen and Fletch argue. Hanssen pins him up against the wall all while Ollie is watching. Hanssen bursts into tears and Ollie recollects Jac saying that he should stay and become a Consultant and how he took the bullet. Hanssen goes out on to the main ward and starts crying again and Ollie comforts him. Hanssen goes back to theatre, telling Sacha that he cannot be CEO anymore. Hanssen continues to work at Holby as a consultant surgeon and is replaced as CEO by Abigail Tate, an old friend of Serena's. During this time suspicions are aroused over the ethics of his old friend John Gaskell and his subsequent medical trials. When the truth about Gaskell was exposed Abigail abruptly left and Hanssen assumed the role of CEO once more, but in the fallout of Roxanna's murder and John's death, he began to question whether he was suitable to lead Holby anymore. =Casualty= In February 2011, Hanssen visits the Emergency Department downstairs (as seen in Casualty), in order to observe the work there. He clashes with Lead Consultant Nick Jordan (Michael French), prompting Hanssen to instate a new Joint Clinical Lead, in the form of Miriam Turner (Cheryl Campbell), Jordan's old mentor. Off-screen, Hanssen promotes Zoe Hanna (Sunetra Sarker) to the emergency department's clinical lead. When he returns to Holby, Hanssen briefly takes charge of the ED while Zoe and Connie are absent. Robyn Miller (Amanda Henderson) and Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford) dislike his presence, especially when he appears suspiciously. Hanssen later sits in on the interviews for a new Band 6 Staff Nurse position in the ED, which Ben \\"Lofty\\" Chiltern (Lee Mead) eventually wins, and is present when Lofty is questioned over the accidental death of an agency nurse. Development The character is portrayed by Guy Henry, pictured. Henry's casting in Holby City was announced in August 2010. He deemed Hanssen \\"a bit of a mystery man\\", sent to the hospital by the Department of Health to make budget cuts. Executive producer Belinda Campbell commented that Henry was a \\"great asset\\" to the cast, expanding: \\"His character will make waves from his very first scene and upset the apple cart of Holby City in more ways than one.\\" Henry shadowed Daren Francis, a surgeon at a North London hospital and Holby City general surgical advisor, as research for the role. He described Hanssen as \\"punctilious, pedantic and passionate about his work\\", but with a dry sense of humour, essential for his rivalry of Connie. He explained that Hanssen is not afraid of making enemies and relishes his Machiavellian tendencies, attributing his fractious relationship with Connie to their mutual God complexes and arrogance. Henry considers Hanssen willing to goad people \\"to go out of their depth\\", with an ability to frequently \\"wrong-foot\\" others. What's on TV deemed Hanssen \\"Holby very own George Osborne\\". Hanssen was initially presented as an \\"unknown quantity\\", including to Henry, who knew little of his character's backstory. In an interview with TV Choice, Henry stated that he believed Hanssen to have come from a \\"rather unfortunate background\\". He was sent from Sweden to attend public school in Britain, possibly following the death of his mother, resulting in him becoming \\"a little more pedantic and English than the English.\\" As of October 2010, his family and love-life had not been decided upon, but it was suggested to Henry that while Hanssen was at medical school, he entered a relationship which did not work out and had not had a romance since. Henry commented that it was possible Hanssen was gay or bisexual, and that an upcoming storyline with a younger female mentee may involve unrequited love. In November 2010, media entertainment website Digital Spy announced that Laila Rouass had been cast as Sahira Shah, a surgeon who shares a \\"dark history\\" with Hanssen, who has guided her career. Henry appears as Hanssen in a two-part crossover episode with Holby City sister show, Casualty, originally broadcast in March 2019. =Departure= On 25 August 2013, it was announced that Henry had decided to quit his role as Hanssen and would be leaving towards the end of the year.Holby City star Guy Henry quits the show - Mirror Online Henry said how \\"wonderful\\" it was to play Hanssen, because he is \\"such a weird man, but fun to play.\\" He also commented on how delightful it was to work with the cast and crew of Holby City. Simon Harper also commented on Guy's performance as Hanssen: ‚ÄúHis brooding, enigmatic performance delivered one of the truly great Holby characters.‚Äù Henry did an interview with Digital Spy, discussing his final episode on 7 October (the day before his exit scenes aired). Speaking of his final episode, Henry said: \\"As usual, what he [Hanssen] does is go into mega-vicious mode. But he does also face a challenge, because he has to do a type of surgery which he hasn't done since he was a junior doctor years and years ago. This frightens him and challenges him. So there's quite a lot of operating to be done!\\"Digital Spy - Holby City: Guy Henry talks Henrik Hanssen exit episode Henry said highlights of his time at Holby City was the storyline with Dylan, in his first episodes, working with Laila Rouass (Sahira Shah), Paul Bradley (Elliot Hope), James Anderson (Oliver Valentine) and Jimmy Akingbola (Antoine Malick). Henry also revealed that when he renewed his contract in 2012, he told the producers that he would not be renewing his contract after that. Throughout the interview, Henry spoke very highly about how pleased he was with his final episode. When asked whether he may return in future, Henry said, \\"Who knows?\\". =Return= On 30 October 2014, Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy reported Henry had reprised the role and Hanssen would be returning in spring 2015. His return was announced alongside those of Oliver Valentine (James Anderson) and Essie Harrison (Kaye Wragg). Kilkelly said Henrik would cause \\"waves\\" upon his return, after deciding to bring his \\"surgical brilliance\\" back to Holby. Henry expressed his gratitude at being able to bring Hanssen back, saying \\"He's such a weird and wonderful character to play - I've missed him! And the cast and crew at Holby are such fun to work with - I've missed them too. We don't know what dark acts may have befallen Henrik during his time away in Sweden but I do believe that, when he looms down the corridors of Holby once more, his wit and his scalpel will be as incisive as ever!\\" Executive producer Oliver Kent commented on how the news should \\"excite Holby fans old and new\\" and he was \\"delighted to welcome back Hanssen, Oliver and Essie as they were popular with viewers. Henry began filming in January 2015. When Guy Self (John Michie) stepped down as CEO to head up a neurology centre, Serena contacted Hanssen about taking over the vacant position. Hanssen's first scenes saw him sitting in his car scrolling through pictures of the staff on his iPad. As the team speculated about who the new CEO was, Hanssen \\"looms in the doorway\\". Henry explained that Hanssen had barely changed and was still \\"a bit of a weirdo!\\" Hanssen immediately set about changing Guy's regime, setting up a clash between the pair. Henry told a South Wales Echo reporter, \\"Henrik profoundly disagrees with the way he has been running the place. Hanssen will be sparring with the surgeon.\\" Henry also teased the reason why Hanssen had returned to Holby, after an attempted reconciliation with his family, commenting, \\"what went wrong?\\" Shortly after returning to Holby, Hanssen also made a guest appearance in Casualty on 11 July. He has since made several appearances in Casualty. During the episode broadcast on 25 October 2016, Hanssen left Holby for Sweden. He also needed to deal with his depression. Producers confirmed that the character had not made a permanent exit from the show and would be returning in the future.  Reception  For his portrayal of Hanssen, Henry was nominated for Best Soap Actor (Male) at the 2018 Digital Spy Reader Awards; he came in eleventh place with 3.1% of the total votes. Hanssen's initial appearances received positive reviews from critics. The Daily Mirror Jane Simon commended Henry's debut, writing that he was \\"off to a head-start, carrying off the haughty, brisk arrogance of a top consultant.\\" What's on TV similarly commented that \\"Henry has a ball playing Holby new top dog, stealing all the best lines as he adds a wonderful slice of cutting humour to proceedings.\\" Another positive review of Hanssen came from Becky Jones of the Leicester Mercury, who deemed him \\"the best thing about the programme\\", with all of the best lines. Rebecca Jordan of OntheBox enjoyed Henry's \\"sarcastic yet strangely affable\\" character, comparing him to Gregory House for his ability to diagnose patients \\"nearly as fast as he distributes withering one-liners.\\" Jordan pinpointed Hanssen's appeal as being the \\"much-needed humour\\" he brought to the series, as well as the dynamic between Hanssen and Connie, writing that \\"the volatile rapport between him and Connie is thoroughly engaging and leaves little doubt in our minds that he will quickly become an exciting addition to the show.\\" What's on TV selected the episode \\"The Short Straw\\" as the \\"Top TV\\" choice of the day, commenting that \\"some of the script is a little heavy-handed, but Guy Henry as panto-esque axeman Henrik is particularly good fun\\". Sarah Ellis writing for Inside Soap said \\"He's great ‚Äì but I'm still very glad that he's not my boss!\\" In April 2011, The Guardian Daniel Maier wrote that Hanssen was \\"the best thing about Holby\\". Maier observed that \\"he is unerringly calm and logical and as such represents the voice of the viewer when irrational behaviour threatens to glibly generate plot. Continuing drama is nothing without secrets, unkeepable promises, anger and jealousy and yet Hanssen unerringly roots these out and placidly advises his charges to get on with the job. He's pure quiet efficiency gold when he should be dramatic poison.\\" The character's return proved popular with critics and viewers. A South Wales Echo reporter stated, \\"The boss is back. Henrik Hanssen, one of Holby's truly great characters, has returned to rattle staff and delight his many fans.\\" Sara Wallis of the Daily Mirror observed, \\"Hanssen is not a man to crack a smile at the best of times but he's particularly moody as Guy shamelessly tries to wrestle control of Holby.\\" References External links * Henrik Hanssen at BBC Online Category:Holby City characters Category:Fictional surgeons Category:Television characters introduced in 2010 Category:Fictional Swedish people Category:Crossover characters in television Category:Male characters in television Category:Fictional Jews Category:Fictional characters with obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder ","title":"Henrik Hanssen"},{"id":"29501080","text":"Frieda Petrenko is a fictional character from the BBC medical drama Holby City, played by Olga Fedori. She first appears during the twelfth series episode \\"Together Alone\\", originally broadcast on 17 February 2010. Frieda was introduced as a nurse, before retraining as a foundation doctor. She departs during the fourteenth series episode \\"Wolf's Clothing\\", originally broadcast on 15 May 2012. Frieda guest stars in a series 17 episode, originally broadcast on 22 September 2015, as a patient diagnosed with tuberculosis. Fedori reprised the role again in 2017 and returns in the nineteenth series episode \\"We Need to Talk About Fredrik\\", originally broadcast on 12 December 2017. The actress quit the role a year later and Frieda departs in the twenty- first series episode \\"Running\\", originally broadcast on 26 March 2019. The character received critical acclaim and Fedori earned a nomination for Best Newcomer at the 16th National Television Awards. Storylines Introduced as the cardiothoracic surgery ward's night shift sister, Frieda transfers to day shifts on the Acute Assessment Unit to cover the maternity leave of sister Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley). Frieda has an initially antagonistic relationship with F2 doctor Penny Valentine (Emma Catherwood). When Penny learns that Frieda was a qualified doctor in her home country, Ukraine, she encourages her to retrain in the UK. Frieda resists the suggestion, but after being made redundant and having her diagnostic ability challenged by registrar Antoine Malick (Jimmy Akingbola), she decides to apply for an F1 position, which she achieves early in 2011. Throughout this series, Frieda and Penny grow closer, and Frieda‚Äôs affection turns from Penny‚Äôs brother, Oliver, to Penny herself. Frieda resolves to tell Penny her feelings, but on the morning she is going to confess, Penny is killed when the roof of a train collapses on her. Frieda faces many difficulties in her F1 year, including the death of her father, which sees her return to Ukraine. When Frieda returns to Holby, she bonds with new colleague, senior nurse Eddi McKee (Sarah-Jane Potts), over their dislike of new F1 Lulu Hutchison (Fiona Hampton), a daddy's girl, who is determined to prove she is a better doctor than Frieda. Frieda overcomes this competition when Lulu is transferred to another hospital; but again leaves Holby to return to Ukraine. It is revealed that she returned to Ukraine as her former mentor, Lev Tereschenko (Andrew Franchuk), is ill with a serious heart condition. Whilst there, she works as waitress at a cafe. Frieda teams up with consultants Elliot Hope (Paul Bradley) and Michael Spence (Hari Dhillon) in order to save Lev. Afterwards, Elliot persuades her to return to Holby. Frieda's return to Holby sees her struggle to adjust to working as a doctor and with new colleague, registrar Luc Hemingway (Joseph Millson). She is also under pressure to complete her F1 portfolio on time. Frieda fears that she has failed her F1 rotation when she is summoned to Henrik Hanssen's (Guy Henry) office, but is pleased to learn that she received the best score in the region and is now an F2, working on Keller ward. While working on Keller, Frieda finds herself caught between Dan Hamilton (Adam Astill) and Malick, who both want to supervise her on her first day. Frieda is later assigned the role of mentoring F1 Tara Lo (Jing Lusi), who temporarily comes from Darwin to work on Keller; although she finds her annoying at first the two eventually build up a good friendship. Frieda is offered a job at St Luke's due to her excellent F1 results, when Malick asks her if she is going to accept it, she throws the number of her potential new boss in the bin and resumes her work. When her clinical lead Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie) and new consultant Serena Campbell (Catherine Russell) place her in the middle of their feud at the expense of a patient, Frieda decides that enough is enough and leaves the hospital to work for a charity treating patients outside of the system. Three years later, Frieda is admitted to the hospital as a patient with tuberculosis. She opens up to Elliot and Oliver Valentine (James Anderson) about blaming herself for her friend's death in Ukraine. She nearly dies and has to have emergency surgery, when Elliot struggles with the procedure, Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel) saves her life. Development =Characterisation= The official Holby City website describes Frieda as \\"sincere, compassionate, supportive [and] honest\\", but \\"self conscious, emotionally closed [and] sarcastic.\\" To prepare for the role, Fedori carried out some medical research. She also researched the goth subculture, as it is \\"far removed\\" from who she is. She admitted that there were moments where she felt that she had to do more research. Fedori also regularly spoke with the costume department about her character's wardrobe, commenting that it is \\"just constantly expanding.\\" The actress felt Frieda was more defined compared to some characters she has played in the past and that she had longer to work on Frieda's \\"subtleties\\". She thought there were some similarities between herself and the character, explaining that she and Frieda were both straightforward people and not good at sugar-coating things. She also thought that she was nerdy like Frieda and enjoyed studying. In one storyline, Frieda is ordered to remove her goth make-up when a patient suffers an allergic reaction to it. Without her \\"mask\\", she loses her confidence. She later rallies after making a successful diagnosis, but ultimately decides that she needs to be herself and reapplies her eyeliner and lipstick. Frieda is introduced as a nurse, but she soon decides to retrain as a foundation doctor and takes her F1 doctor's exams, which leads to a \\"crisis of faith\\". Frieda is distracted from opening her results when she treats fellow student doctor Jez Atkins (Jake Fairbrother), who is injured falling from his bike. Frieda's \\"fears are compounded\\" when she talks to Jez about the exams, but after diagnosing him with Crohn's disease, Frieda is called up to see CEO Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry), who informs her that she has achieved the best results in the region. =Father's death= The character departed the series for a few episodes in series 13, as she travelled to Ukraine for her father's funeral. Series producer Myar Craig-Brown said that when she returns, Frieda has \\"more determination to focus on her job.\\" She immediately forms a rivalry with F1 doctor Lulu Hutchinson, who \\"challenges\\" her. Frieda initially appears to be coping with her father's death, but she begins to find it harder to concentrate and avoids facing up to her emotions. Her colleague Sacha Levy is concerned when she struggles to deliver news of a patient's death to their family members. But Frieda soon insists on scrubbing in for surgery. Fedori commented, \\"There's a huge elephant in the room because of Frieda's grief.\\" She and Lulu compete for a chance to be part of the procedure, and Lulu tries flirting with Michael Spence to increase her chance of being chosen. Frieda is chosen to go into theatre, but when she is delayed, Lulu takes her place. When Frieda does finally get there, she realises she cannot handle the surgery and choose to step away. Fedori thought it was an important step for Frieda to admit that she is struggling. When asked by an Inside Soap writer if Frieda's softer side would emerge, Fedori replied \\"Oh, her character isn't going to change. She'll always be the type of person who says exactly what she thinks!\\" =Departure (2012)= On 18 April 2012, Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy reported that Fedori had filmed her final scenes as Frieda, and that she would depart during the following month. Of Fedori's exit, a spokesperson for the BBC stated \\"Olga has been a fantastic asset to Holby City and will be sorely missed by the cast and crew. Everyone wishes her all the best for the future.\\" Consultant series producer Justin Young later revealed that Fedori had to leave the show quickly for personal reasons. Young also said that her character was beloved by the team, and he wished they had had the opportunity to make her exit bigger. =Returns= Frieda returned during the episode broadcast 22 September 2015. The show's series producer Simon Harper had remained in contact with Fedori. She emailed him to inform him that she wanted to return. Harper was planning Paul Bradley's exit as long-standing character Professor Elliot Hope from the series. He believed that Frieda's return was \\"brilliant timing\\" because it was a \\"treat\\" for viewers who would be upset by Elliot's departure. On 4 October 2017, Kilkelly (Digital Spy) confirmed that Fedori had reprised the role for a six-month guest stint. Frieda will return in December, after Elliot asks her to work with Jac Naylor. Harper stated, \\"Frieda has a special place in the heart of the viewers, who I know will be as thrilled as I am to welcome her back to the wards. She's a familiar face back at the hospital at a time of change, with her trademark deadpan wit and unique outlook very much intact.\\" He added that viewers should expect \\"fireworks\\" between Jac and Frieda, who does not want to be at Holby. Frieda returns in the nineteenth series episode \\"We Need to Talk About Fredrik\\", originally broadcast on 12 December 2017, as a qualified registrar who clashes with Jac. = Departure (2019) = On 26 March 2019, Frieda left the series after Fedori decided to quit the role. The character departs in the twenty-first series episode \\"Running\\". The exit was not announced beforehand and was a surprise for the audience. In the narrative, Frieda leaves Holby to work for an aid organisation where she can \\"make a difference\\" after facing an \\"ethical dilemma\\" following a long-running struggle. Reception In 2011, Fedori was short-listed for the \\"Best Newcomer\\" award at the National Television Awards for her performance as Frieda. The award was ultimately won by EastEnders Ricky Norwood. Ian Cullen of Monsters and Critics lamented Fedori's loss, opining that her performance in Holby City is hilarious. Frieda has received critical acclaim, with the Daily Mirror Jim Shelley naming her the \\"best character on television\\". Shelley has included several of her one-liners in his regular \\"Soundbites of the Week\\" column, including her excuse: \\"I saw it in one of your Carry On films. I thought he might like it\\", delivered after inserting a sunflower into the rectum of a racist patient. Fellow Mirror critic Jane Simon has also praised Frieda, deeming her one of the series' most interesting characters. Simon describes her as a \\"fearless, straight talking [...] super-nurse\\", enjoying her ability to \\"liven up the place with her unlikely combination of ghoulish demeanour and slapstick sense of humour.\\" When a 2011 storyline featured Frieda facing redundancy, Simon commented, \\"we would be gutted if she left. Her friendly scowl is one of the best things about the show.\\" Simon bemoaned Frieda's low-key exit, saying \\"Some staff members at Holby get massive exit storylines. Others [...] are out of the door before you realise they're going. And that's the case again tonight with our very favourite Ukrainian goth nurse turned junior doctor ‚Äì Frieda Petrenko. One minute she's making an impassioned speech about patient care, the next we're told she's chucked in her job. Just like that.\\" Justin Harp of Digital Spy called Frieda's second exit \\"emotional\\" and \\"heartbreaking\\".

He made his first appearance in the twelfth series episode \\"Talk to Me\\", broadcast on 5 January 2010. Sacha joined the Keller ward staff as a specialist registrar in general surgery. Sacha is the father of long-serving character Chrissie Williams's infant son, Daniel, as a result of a one-night stand, and has since held unreciprocated feelings for her. Since Chrissie's departure in 2013, Sacha's storylines have seen a relationship with Essie Harrison (Kaye Wragg) and a battle with depression. Storylines Sacha has a one-night stand with Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley). He then appears briefly in a locum registrar capacity, before, much to Chrissie's surprise, returning several months later on a six-month contract as a locum registrar on the hospital's general surgical ward, Keller, working alongside permanent registrar Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel) and under consultant general surgeons Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie) and Michael Spence (Hari Dhillon). Sacha's post later became permanent, though he transferred to head up the hospital's Acute Assessment Unit (AAU) by director of surgery Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry), after clinical lead Michael Spence became engaged working on the plastic surgery unit on Darwin ward with Sunil Bhatti. Sacha continues to work on AAU alongside Chrissie, and he tries to win her over several times. Despite this, she enters into a relationship with Dan Hamilton (Adam Astill), and they become engaged to be married. However, when Dan is revealed to be gay, Chrissie becomes closer to Sacha and realizes that he is the man for her as he is so nice. She then goes on holiday to Australia with him, and they later become engaged as well. When Sacha is stabbed by an unstable patient, Chrissie and Michael just manage to save him, despite a lot of blood loss, and it later causes conflict between Chrissie and student doctor Ella Henderson, who left Sacha to bleed out of fear. However, Sacha convinces Chrissie to lay easy on her. They marry, despite Chrissie's original concerns, and return to work on AAU. Sacha tries to help fellow doctor Luc Hemmingway (Joseph Millson), who is having problems and invites him for a turbulent Christmas dinner. Luc soon departs Holby after receiving advice from Sacha. Sacha befriends new doctor Gemma Wilde (Ty Glaser). After a family holiday, Sacha's daughter Rachel is taken ill, and he is devastated to learn she has leukemia. As her treatment begins, he shaves his head to show support to her. When he learns that Daniel is a bone marrow match and is potentially the only one that can save Rachel's life, he authorizes the procedure without Chrissie's permission, creating problems between them. After a rocky few months, Chrissie takes Daniel and visits her father in Australia. When she returns, he learns through Daniel's nursery that she is back and suspects Chrissie of having an affair with Michael. However, it conspires she has breast cancer, which devastates Sacha. He later moves back in with Chrissie to support Daniel, but their separation continues. Development =Casting and characterisation= To compensate for the departing characters, several new characters joined the show during the course of the twelfth series. After appearing briefly as Chrissie's one-night stand, Bob Barrett became a main cast member playing Locum General surgical registrar Sacha Levy at Holby City Hospital. Barrett was initially contracted for eight months as part of the main cast. In May 2012, Barrett stated \\"I love it here and that's always been the case ‚Äì since day one, I've had a ball. I love the cast, the crew and the people who run the show - it's a great team. I love being part of a programme that people hold dearly ‚Äì and I feel the responsibility of that, too. He told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that he wanted to remain a part of the cast as long as his character had \\"a journey\\". Barrett appears as Sacha in a crossover two-part episode with Holby City sister show, Casualty, originally broadcast in March 2019. =Depression= Sacha has been the focus of a story which raises awareness of male depression and it was scripted over an entire year. In April 2017, episodes featured Sacha behaving out of character and Essie Harrison (Kaye Wragg) worries about his mental health. The story begins when Sacha does not style his hair for work and wears dirty clothing. His usual caring bedside manner changed and he becomes irritated with a patient. He also tries to steal wine from a bar which prompts Essie to believe he has developed depression. Sacha breaks down in tears and reveals that he has been stealing to make himself feel better. Sacha gets his depression treated and gradually regains control. In July 2018, his behavior starts to cause concern again. First Sacha ends experimental research he had invested his own money into. Then his daughter cancels plans to go on holiday. He then develops feelings for his friend Patricia Ghraoui (Sirine Saba). After he operates on her hernia, Sacha asks her to date him but Patricia refuses. This puts Sacha in a bad mood and he tells hospital porter Jason Haynes (Jules Robertson) that being a parent will eventually make him feel pointless. Following Sacha's mood swings viewers began to speculate that Sacha would try to commit suicide. On 10 August 2018, a special episode of Holby City focusing on Sacha's mental health was announced. It was revealed that during the episode the character would become an emotionally unstable attempt to commit suicide from the hospital roof. The episode includes old scenes which are played out with a new perspective revealing insight into Sacha's depressive thoughts. Michelle Lipton wrote the episode which aims to raise awareness of male mental health and the way it affects men who chose to ignore symptoms so they are not perceived as weak. The show's executive producer Simon Harper said that the episode was \\"incredibly important\\" and focused on \\"one troubled year in the life of one beloved, vulnerable character.\\" Series producer Kate Hall described Barrett's performance as \\"absolutely heartbreaking\\". Holby City worked alongside the British mental health charity Mind, their advice service helped the show create a really dramatic depiction of male depression. Jenni Regan from Mind said that \\"using such a well-loved and popular character\\" had the potential to change negative attitudes towards mental health. Producers later hired the actor's daughter Francesca Barrett to play his on-screen daughter Beka Levy. She is reintroduced into the series to help Sacha deal with his depression. By December 2018, Sacha still had not told Beka about his condition. Barrett told Laura-Jayne Tyler from Inside Soap that his character was dealing with depression the best he could but finds it tough at different times. Sacha had unresolved issues with Beka that dated back to the day he attempted suicide. He had never sorted through their differences following the angry voice mail he had left her. After advice from Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry), Sacha reconnects with Beka and tells her the truth about his depression. Barrett added that by the end of the conversation both characters are in \\"floods of tears\\". He also enjoyed the opportunity to work on the story with his actual daughter because they have a strong relationship, which he believed could be seen on-screen. Reception A reporter from the Evening Chronicle branded him \\"the permanently disorganised Sacha\\". A writer of the Teesside Gazette said that they would never consider Sacha as a \\"dark horse\\" type of character. A Daily Mirror critic jested \\"Bumbling doctor Sacha has never been lucky in love himself, so it's no surprise that he thinks the worst when he sees Essie becoming friendly with a colleague.\\" A What's on TV reporter said \\"Sacha Levy has always been Holby‚Äôs Mr Happy-Go-Lucky\\" and \\"Sacha Levy is always the one Holby City consultant people can rely.\\" Sue Haasler writing for Metro, praised Barrett's performance during his depression storyline. She opined that \\"Bob Barrett is a naturally smiley actor, but I loved how for most of the episode he somehow managed to keep the customary twinkle out of his eyes ‚Äì we could see that Sacha was putting on a brave face and wasn't really happy.\\" References External links * Sacha Levy at BBC Online Category:Holby City characters Category:Fictional physicians Category:Fictional English Jews Category:Television characters introduced in 2010 Category:Crossover characters in television Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Sacha Levy"},{"id":"29501094","text":"Rashid Menhas Shafayat (born 18 June 1980) is a former English cricketer.

He succeeded his mother Isabella, Countess of Foix. His father was Archambaud de Grailly. Life =Early life= As a result of the Treaty of Tarbes signed on 10 May 1399, John's parents were given possession of the County of Foix, but it required that his father renounce his English alliance, and it stipulated that John and one of his brothers were to be sent as hostages to the Royal Court of France to ensure observance of the terms of the treaty. On 24 April 1406 Charles VI of France recognised John as heir to the County of Foix and he was also involved in several operations against the English: the Siege of Bordeaux in 1404-1405 and the Seat of Blaye in 1406. In 1409, John accompanied King Martin of Aragon on an expedition to Sardinia against the Genoese at the Battle of Sanluri on 30 May 1409 and returned to Foix in September. =Aragon= When Martin died on 31 May 1410 without surviving children, two princes tried to claim the succession: Ferdinand of Castile, nephew of Martin and Louis II of Anjou, married to Yolande of Aragon, daughter of King John I of Aragon, brother and predecessor of Martin. The dowager Queen Violant of Aragon, widow of King John I, wrote to John on 20 January 1411 promising the return of Rosanes and Martorell (part of the properties confiscated from his maternal uncle Matthew of Foix) if her daughter Yolande succeeded to the throne, as a result John sent troops to help Louis and Yolande in their claim, but Ferdinand prevailed ultimately on 25 June 1412 by the compromise of Caspe. However, John was able to gain the lost estates by a marriage to Joanna of Urgell, granddaughter of Peter IV of Aragon. John fought with Aragon against Castile, but helped his brother Peter, Cardinal of Foix and Arles, to crush insurgents from Aragon. =Count of Foix= John's father Archambaud died in 1412, John then became Count of Foix; he was co-ruler of Foix with his mother Isabella until her death in 1428. In 1402, John married Joan, eldest daughter of Charles III of Navarre; two months after the wedding, she was formally recognised as heiress presumptive of Navarre. Navarre would have become part of the Foix inheritance if John and Joan had children, but they failed to produce children and Joan died in July 1413. During the Hundred Years War, John switched his support between the English and French a few times, mainly for his own personal gain; always aligning with the side who promised him the most political and economic benefits at the relevant time. As sovereign of the Pyrenean Principality he took up a neutral stance in the war which was reflected in its motto ni Anglais, ni Fran√ßais (Neither England, nor France). John became Count of Bigorre in 1415 by agreement with Bernard VII, Count of Armagnac, the title was finally recognised by the King of France by letters dating from 18 November 1425, which definitively stabilized John's new position. The King of France installed him as Governor of Dauphin√© in 1416. In 1425 he was appointed Governor of Languedoc and received from the King the title Viscount of Lautrec. He also bought the Viscountcy of Villemur. Although John was sided with the French at the time, he did not take part in the Battle of Agincourt; the French army suffered a crushing defeat by the English forces commanded by King Henry V. John's brother Archambaud was killed during the battle. John died 4 May 1446 and was succeeded by his son Gaston. Family John married firstly to Joan of Navarre in 1402; they had no children. John married secondly in 1422 to Jeanne d'Albret. She was the daughter of Charles I of Albret, co-commander of the French Army in the Battle of Agincourt where in 1415 he was killed. John and Jeanne had two children: *Gaston (27 November 1422 - 25 July/28 July 1472), succeeded his father and married Eleanor of Navarre (niece of John's first wife). *Peter (died 1454) Viscount of Lautrec After Jeanne's death, John married thirdly in 1436 to Joanna, daughter of James II of Urgell and Isabella of Aragon; they had no children, but the marriage helped John recover the remaining Spanish property he was owed.

She began piano studies at an early age with Friedrich Kalkbrenner in Paris, and in 1822 made her debut in Frankfurt am Main at a concert organized by Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Guhr. This was followed by a European tour the next year, including appearances in Paris and London, and later by additional tours.

The concerto premiered in 1831 and Mendelssohn dedicated the work to her. In 1833, Von Schauroth married English clergyman Edwin Hill-Handley and moved to London, but continued her concert appearances.

Noise generators are used to test signals for measuring noise figure, frequency response, and other parameters. Noise generators are also used for generating random numbers. Theory There are several circuits used for noise generation. For example, temperature- controlled resistors, temperature-limited vacuum diodes, zener diodes, and gas discharge tubes. A source that can be switched on and off (\\"gated\\") is beneficial for some test methods. Noise generators usually rely on a fundamental noise process such as thermal noise or shot noise. Thermal noise generator Thermal noise can be a fundamental standard. A resistor at a certain temperature has a thermal noise associated with it. A noise generator might have two resistors at different temperatures and switch between the two resistors. The resulting output power is low. (For a 1 kŒ© resistor at room temperature and a 10 kHz bandwidth, the RMS noise voltage is 400 nV.Google Calculator result for 1 kŒ© room temperature 10 kHz bandwidth) Shot noise generator If electrons flow across a barrier, then they have discrete arrival times. Those discrete arrivals exhibit shot noise. The output noise level of a shot noise generator is easily set by the DC bias current. Typically, the barrier in a diode is used. Different noise generator circuits use different methods of setting the DC bias current. =Vacuum diode= One common noise source was a thermally-limited (saturated-emission) hot-cathode vacuum tube diode. These sources could serve as white noise generators from a few kilohertz through UHF and were available in normal radio tube glass envelopes. Flicker (1/f) noise limited application at lower frequencies; electron transit time limited application at higher frequencies. The basic design was a diode vacuum tube with a heated filament. The temperature of the cathode (filament) sets the anode (plate) current that determines the shot noise; see Richardson equation. The anode voltage is set large enough to collect all the electrons emitted by the filament. If the plate voltage were too low, then there would be space charge near the filament that would affect the noise output. For a calibrated generator, care must be taken so that the shot noise dominates the thermal noise of the tube's plate resistance and other circuit elements. =Gas-discharge tubes= Long, thin, hot-cathode gas- discharge glass tubes fitted with a normal bayonet light bulb mount for the filament and an anode top cap, were used for SHF frequencies and diagonal insertion into a waveguide.Hewlett-Packard 1981 Catalog, page 437, \\"The 347A waveguide sources are argon gas discharge tubes carefully mounted in waveguide sections for frequencies from 3.95 to 18 GHz. Model 349A also uses an argon tube in a coaxial configuration for frequencies from 400 to 4000 MHz.\\" They were filled with a pure inert gas such as neon because mixtures made the output temperature-dependent. Their burning voltage was under 200 V, but they needed optical priming (pre-ionizing) by a 2-Watt incandescent lamp prior to ignition by an anode voltage spike in the 5-kV range. One miniature thyratron found an additional use as a noise source, when operated as a diode (grid tied to cathode) in a transverse magnetic field. =Forward-biased semiconductor diode= Another possibility is using the collector current in a transistor. =Reverse-biased semiconductor diode= Reverse-biased diodes in breakdown can also be used as shot noise sources. Voltage regulator diodes are common, but there are two different breakdown mechanisms, and they have different noise characteristics. The mechanisms are the Zener effect and avalanche breakdown. Zener diode Reverse-biased diodes and bipolar transistor base-emitter junctions that breakdown below about 7 volts primarily exhibit the Zener effect; the breakdown is due to internal field emission. The junctions are thin, and the electric field is high. Zener breakdown is shot noise. The flicker (1/f) noise corner can be below 10 Hz. The noise generated by zener diodes is a simple shot noise. Avalanche diode For breakdown voltages greater than 7 volts, the semiconductor junction width is thicker and primary breakdown mechanism is an avalanche. The noise output is more complicated. There is excess noise (i.e., noise over and above the simple shot noise) because there is avalanche multiplication. For higher power output noise generators, amplification is needed. For broadband noise generators, that amplification can be difficult to achieve. One method uses avalanche multiplication within the same barrier that generates the noise. In an avalanche, one carrier collides with other atoms and knocks free new carriers. The result is that for each carrier that starts across a barrier, several carriers synchronously arrive. The result is a wide-bandwidth high-power source. Conventional diodes can be used in breakdown. The avalanche breakdown also has multistate noise. The noise output power randomly switches among several output levels. Multistate noise looks somewhat like flicker (1/f) noise. The effect is process dependent, but it can be minimized. Diodes may also be selected for low multistate noise. A commercial example of an avalanche diode noise generator is the Agilent 346C that covers 10 MHz to 26.5 GHz.http://www.home.agilent.com/agilent/product.jspx?nid=-536902744.536880071.00&lc;=eng&cc;=US, 346C Noise Source, 10 MHz to 26.5 GHz, nominal ENR 15 dB See also *Excess noise ratio *Noise figure meter *Radio noise source References * * Category:Electronic test equipment Category:Noise (electronics) Category:Random number generation ","title":"Noise generator"},{"id":"29501351","text":"Valiha is a bamboo genus in the tribe Bambuseae found in Madagascar.

During the first 15 days after Kik's re-release as a messaging app, over 1 million accounts were created. In May 2016, Kik Messenger announced that they had approximately 300 million registered users, and was used by approximately 40% of United States' teenagers. Kik Messenger announced in October 2019 they had signed a letter of intent with MediaLab AI, followed by the announcement Kik Interactive would be reducing their staff from 100 to just 19.https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/13/kik-says-its-here-to- stay-following-shutdown-reports MediaLab owns several mobile apps, most notably Whisper.  History  Kik Interactive was founded in 2009 by a group of students from the University of Waterloo in Canada who wished to create new technologies for use on mobile smartphones. Kik Messenger is the first app developed by Kik Interactive, and was released on October 19, 2010. Within 15 days of its release, Kik Messenger reached one million user registrations, with Twitter being credited as a catalyst for the new application's popularity. On November 24, 2010, Research In Motion (RIM) removed Kik Messenger from BlackBerry App World and limited the functionality of the software for its users. RIM also sued Kik Interactive for patent infringement and misuse of trademarks. In October 2013, the companies settled the lawsuit, with the terms undisclosed. In November 2014, Kik announced a $38.3 million Series C funding round and its first acquisition, buying GIF Messenger \\"Relay\\". The funding was from Valiant Capital Partners, Millennium Technology Value Partners, and SV Angel. By this time, Kik had raised a total of $70.5 million.Russell, Jon November 19, 2014 TechCrunch. \\"Chat App Kik Raises $38M And Makes Its First Acquisition, Buying GIF Messenger Relay\\" On August 16, 2015, Kik received a $50 million investment from Chinese Internet giant Tencent, the parent company of the popular Chinese messaging service WeChat. The investment earned the company a billion dollar valuation. Company CEO Ted Livingston stated Kik's aspirations to become \\"the WeChat of the West\\" and said that attracting younger users was an important part of the company's strategy. In 2017 Kik decided against more VC funding, instead raising nearly $100 million in a high-profile initial coin offering (ICO) on the Ethereum blockchain. In this crowd sale, they sold \\"Kin\\" digital tokens to the contributors. In November 2017, Kik Messenger was silently removed from the Windows Store. As of 23 January 2018, neither the developers nor Microsoft have provided a statement or an explanation on the removal of the app. In June 2018, the Kin Coin was officially released on the Kik platform in Beta. In July 2018, the Kin Foundation released the Kinit beta app on the Google Play store, restricted to US residents only. It offers different ways of earning and spending the Kin coin natively; for example, a user can do simple surveys to earn Kin and spend it on digital goods like gift cards. In September 2019, Kik's CEO and founder Ted Livingston, announced in a blog post that Kik Messenger would be shut down on 19 October 2019 to focus more on the Kin coin whilst in an ongoing legal battle with the SEC. He further announced that over 100 employees would be laid off. An announcement on 13 October 2019, however, ultimately retracted the decision to close Kik and it was announced that the app would remain. In October 2019, Kik announced in its blog that Medialab acquired Kik Messenger . Features A main attraction of Kik that differentiates it from other messaging apps is its anonymity. To register for the Kik service, a user must enter a first and last name, e-mail address, and birth date (which, as of February 2016, must show that the user is at least 13 years old), and select a username. The Kik registration process does not request or require the entry of a phone number (although the user has the option to enter one), unlike some other messaging services that require a user to provide a functioning mobile phone number. The New York Times has reported that, according to law enforcement, Kik's anonymity features go beyond those of most widely used apps. As of February 2016, Kik's guide for law enforcement said that the company cannot locate user accounts based on first and last name, e-mail address and/or birth date; the exact username is required to locate a particular account. The guide further said that the company does not have access to content or \\"historical user data\\" such as photographs, videos, and the text of conversations, and that photographs and videos are automatically deleted shortly after they are sent. A limited amount of data from a particular account (identified by exact username), including first and last name, birthdate, e-mail address, link to a current profile picture, device-related information, and user location information such as the most recently used IP address, can be preserved for a period of 90 days pending receipt of a valid order from law enforcement. Kik's anonymity has also been cited as a protective safety measure for good faith users, in that \\"users have screennames; the app doesn't share phone numbers or email addresses.\\" Kik introduced several new user features in 2015, including a full-screen in-chat browser that allows users to find and share content from the web; a feature allowing users to send previously recorded videos in Kik Messenger for Android and iOS; and \\"Kik Codes\\", which assigns each user a unique code similar to a QR code, making it easier to connect and chat with other users. Kik joined the Virtual Global Taskforce, a global anti-child-abuse organization, in March 2015. Kik began using Microsoft's PhotoDNA in March 2015 to premoderate images added by users. That same month, Kik released native video capture allowing users to record up to 15 seconds in the chat window. In October 2015, Kik partnered with the Ad Council as part of an anti-bullying campaign. The campaign was featured on the app and Kik released stickers in collaboration with the campaign. Kik released a feature to send GIFs as emojis in November 2015. Kik added SafePhoto to its safety features in October 2016 which \\"detects, reports, and deletes known child exploitation images\\" sent through the platform. Kik partnered with ConnectSafely in 2016 to produce a \\"parents handbook\\" and joined The Technology Coalition, an anti-sexual exploitation group including Facebook, Google, Twitter and LinkedIn. =Bots= Kik added promoted chats in 2014, which used bots to converse with users about promoted brands through keywords activating responses. The feature allows companies to communicate with more potential clients than would be possible manually. Promoted messages reach target audiences by gender, country and device. In April 2016, Kik added a bot store to its app, which allows users to order food or products through an automated chat. Third-party companies release bots which will access the company's offerings. The bot shop added a web bubble (also known as \\"wubbles\\") feature to allow rich media content to be shared in conversation threads, as well as suggested responses and a feature allowing bots to be active in group threads. An update, released in September 2016, added concierge bots which can give users tips, tutorials, or recommendations within a specific brand.  Security  On November 4, 2014, Kik scored 1 out of 7 points on the Electronic Frontier Foundation's secure messaging scorecard. Kik received a point for encryption during transit but lost points because communications are not encrypted with a key to which the provider does not have access, users cannot verify contacts' identities, past messages are not secure if the encryption keys are stolen, the code is not open to independent review, the security design is not properly documented, and there had not been a recent independent security audit. Awards and recognition On October 1, 2014, Sony Music and Kik Interactive were given a Smarties award by the Mobile Marketing Association (MMA) for their global music marketing campaign with One Direction. In October 2016, company CEO Ted Livingston was recognized as Toronto's most brilliant tech innovator by Toronto Life for his work with Kik. Livingston was also recognized for being one of the \\"Most Creative People in Business\\" on Fast Companys 2017 list.  Controversies  =Child exploitation= Child exploitation is prominent on Kik Messenger, causing law enforcement and the media to frequently express concerns about the app. Automated spam bots have also been used to distribute explicit images and text over Kik Messenger. A state law enforcement official interviewed by The New York Times in February 2016 identified Kik as \\"the problem app of the moment\\". Police say they find Kik's response frustrating and one detective said obtaining information from Kik was a \\"bureaucratic nightmare\\". Constable Jason Cullum of Northamptonshire Police paedophile online investigation team stated delays in obtaining information from the company increased the risk to children. Cullum stated, \\"It's incredibly frustrating. We're banging our heads against a brick wall. There's a child that's going to be abused for probably another 12 months before we know who that is.\\"Kik chat app 'involved in 1,100 child abuse cases' BBC Prior to 2015, Kik Interactive addressed this issue by informing parents and police about their options to combat child exploitation. In March 2015, the company adopted a more aggressive strategy by utilizing Microsoft's PhotoDNA cloud service to automatically detect, delete, and report the distribution of child exploitation images on its app. (Some experts have noted that because PhotoDNA operates by comparing images against an existing database of exploitative images, it does not effectively prevent \\"realtime\\" online child abuse and may not detect material not yet added to its comparison database.) Kik Interactive also began collaborating internationally with law enforcement by joining the Virtual Global Taskforce, a partnership between businesses, child protection agencies, and international police services that combats online child exploitation and abuse. The company also sponsors an annual conference on crimes against children. =Minors' use of Kik= Kik has been criticized for providing inadequate parental control over minors' use of the app. The ability to share messages without alerting parents has been noted as \\"one of the reasons why teens like Kik\\". Parents cannot automatically view their child's Kik communications remotely from another device, but instead must have the password to their child's user account and view the communications on the same device used by their child. As of February 2016, Kik's parents' guide stresses that teens between 13 and 18 should have a parent's permission to use Kik, but there is no technical way to enforce the requirement or to guarantee that a minor will not enter a false birthdate. Kik Interactive has said that it uses \\"typical\\" industry standards for age verification, that \\"perfect age verification\\" is \\"not plausible\\", and that the company deletes accounts of users under 13 when it finds them, or when a parent requests the deletion. =Open-source module name= In March 2016, Kik Interactive was involved in a high-profile dispute over use of the name \\"kik\\" with independent code developer Azer Ko√ßulu, the author of numerous open- source software modules published on npm, a package manager widely used by JavaScript projects to install dependencies. Ko√ßulu had published an extension to Node.js on npm under the name \\"kik\\". Kik Interactive contacted him objecting to his use of the name, for which the company claimed intellectual property rights, and asked him to change the name. When Ko√ßulu refused, Kik Interactive contacted npm management, who agreed to transfer ownership of the module to Kik without Ko√ßulu's consent. Ko√ßulu then unpublished all of his modules from npm, including a popular eleven-line code module called \\"left- pad\\" upon which many JavaScript projects depended. Although Ko√ßulu subsequently published left-pad on GitHub, its sudden removal from npm caused many projects (including Kik itself) to stop working, due to their dependency on the Node and Babel packages. In view of widespread software disruption, npm restored left-pad and made Cameron Westland of Autodesk its maintainer. The incident sparked controversies over the assertion of intellectual property rights and the use of dependencies in software development. Cryptocurrency Kin is an ERC-20 cryptocurrency token issued on the public Ethereum blockchain. Kin was first announced in early 2017 which marked a pivot in Kik's strategy, a response to difficulties faced from competing with larger social networks such as Facebook. Kin was launched in September 2017 with an initial coin offering (ICO) raising $98 million from 10,000 participants. The purpose of the token is to facilitate value transfers in digital services such as gaming applications and social media, and was initially launched on Kik Messenger to leverage the application's 15 million monthly active users. The enforcement division of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission considers the cryptocurrency offering to have been an unregulated security issue and is expected to begin legal action against the company. Kik has challenged the SEC's ability to regulate cryptocurrencies. On September 7, 2017, only days before the Kin ICO, Kik announced that Canadian citizens would be barred from participating, citing weak guidance from the Ontario Securities Commission for the decision. This partly suppressed participation in the ICO, with only $98 million raised of the $125 million goal. By 2019 the value of Kin had fallen by 99%.

Officially opened on 20 June 1897, it occupies about of land. The park was developed by the town of Hanley over a period of five years and cost approximately ¬£70,000. It has been described as a good example of a late Victorian municipal park. Site The area previously comprised a large waste ground called 'Stoke Fields', cut in two by the Caldon Canal. The land was purchased from the estate of Shelton Hall which stood a third of a mile to the north between Cemetery Road and Caledonian Road, and is now substantially outside the area of Hanley Park. Design of the park The park was developed under the supervision of the landscape architect Thomas Hayton Mawson of Windermere, who created Burslem Park around the same time. Mawson's design makes use of terracotta to highlight features such as the axis between the bridge across the canal and the pavilion. The pavilion, which is arguably the park's main focal point, was completed in 1896, and was designed by Mawson's junior partner Dan Gibson. The bandstand was the beneficiary of Mr George Howson, a local pottery owner. The southwest end consists of a lake where fishing is permitted. Next to the lake is a word sculpture that reads and Other facilities in the park include a basketball court, a football court and four children's play areas. At the western end of Hanley Park, adjacent to Stoke-on-Trent College, previously known as Cauldon College, there is the small Cauldon Park. The Hanley Park Fete was held from 1897 to 1939 and featured a funfair, side shows and a display of fireworks. The Potteries Central Horse Parade (open to anyone living within 10 miles of Hanley Town Hall) was also held annually (but it was never resumed after World War II). Restoration In June 2015, it was announced that a ¬£4.5 million Heritage Lottery Fund grant had been secured, which would allow for the restoration of the pavilion, boathouse, canal bridges, lake and fountains. Hanley parkrun Hanley Park hosts a free, weekly, timed 5km parkrun every Saturday at 9 a.m. The first Hanley parkrun took place in September 2011.

History Nightfreight GB was first founded in 1984. A year later, in 1985, a cooperative with several like minded transport companies was formed. This was to help each other, with parcel deliveries around the country. The original group consisted of seven depots, and a hub operation in Willenhall. Over the next few years, the Nightfreight network grew rapidly, with new members joining the consortium. In 1990, a purpose built hub was introduced in Willenhall, and the company developed and introduced a computerized parcel tracking system (NightTrak). This was to speed up the operation of the company. During the beginning of the 1990s, various companies that had previously been consortium members, became owned subsidiaries of the company. In August 1993, it was listed on the London Stock Exchange as a PLC until January 2001, after which the company was placed back into private ownership. In September 1995, Hay Pollock was acquired, which subsequently became the International and Logistics arm of the company. In April 2004, a new home delivery service, Deliver2Home, was launched adding to the one man home and white glove two man Pacemaker delivery services. The company over time developed a niche in delivering irregular dimension and weight, or IDW, freight and soon became the market leader within that specific segment. Nightfreight operated a fleet of over 1,000 vehicles, and employed over 2,500 people, spanning across three hubs and fifty two depots around the United Kingdom. On 15 March 2012, Nightfreight GB was acquired by the DX Group, resulting in a business with combined revenues of approximately ¬£300m per year. The acquisition created the United Kingdom and Ireland's largest independent mail, courier, and network distribution service provider. On 27 February 2014, DX Group announced its First Day of Dealings on the AIM Stock Market.

KhƒÅdir or Khadar and BƒÅngur (Hindi language: ‡§ñ‡§æ‡§¶‡§∞ ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§¨‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ó‡§∞, Urdu language⁄©ŸáÿßÿØÿ± ÿßŸàÿ± ÿ®ÿßŸÜ⁄Øÿ±) are terms used in Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi and Sindhi in the Indo-Gangetic plains of North India and Pakistan to differentiate between two types of river plains and alluvial soils. Bangur and Kadir areas are commonly found in the doab regions. Some villages may have both Khadar and Bangar areas within their revenue boundaries. Bhangar soils are less fertile as they are above flood level whereas Khadar soils are more fertile as they are below flood level. Bhanger is full of kankers(lime module) and khadar soil is composed of fine silt & clay. Khadar and Bangar =Khadir or Nali areas= Khadir or Khadar (Hindi: ‡§ñ‡§æ‡§¶‡§∞), also called Nali or Naili, are low-lying areas that are floodplains of a river which is usually relatively narrower compared to unflooded bangar area. Khadar areas are prone to flooding and sometimes include portions of former river-beds that became available for agriculture when a river changes course. It is moisture retentive and sticky when wet. Khadir soil consists of new alluvial soil relatively higher in new silt content from the river, gets replenished with each flooding cycle,and is often very fertile.Kiran Prem,1994, Haryana District Gazetteers: Faridabad, Haryana, Page 16. The Khadir is also called Nali in the northern Haryana which is the fertile prairie tract between the Ghaggar river and the southern limits of the Saraswati channel depression that gets flooded during the rains.\\"The imperial gazeteers of India, 1908\\", British Raj, page 288.] Sri Sri Ravi's Art of Living Foundation World Culture Festival, 2016 (11 March) was held on Yamuna's Khadir floodplains and National Green Tribunal (NGT) recommended a fine of INR 50 million, on Art of Living Foundation for damaging ecology on Yamuna's Khadar flood plains. = Bangar areas and subtypes= Bangar/Bangad/Bhangar (Hindi: ‡§¨‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ó‡§∞) areas are beyond floodplains,August 2010, On The brink: Water governance in the Yamuna river basin in Haryana, Society for Promotion of Wastelands Development, PEACE Institute Charitable Trust, page vi. that lie more upland, and compared to Khadar it consists of older alluvial soil which is higher in sandy loam content. Bangar area are less prone to flooding but are usually more sandy and less fertile as well. A Bangar area, can be further subdivided into the following based on the type of irrigation:Punjab Law Reporter journal.Sunil Kumar Singh, 2001, Dictionary of Land Revenue Terms in India, Centre for Rural Studies, Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration [in association with] Greenfields Publishers. * Barani area are traditionally rain-fed areas. These are any low rain area where the rain-fed dry farming is practiced. Bagar tract, the dry sandy tract of land on the border of Rajasthan state adjoining the states of Haryana and Punjab,E. Walter Coward, 1980, \\"Irrigation and Agricultural Development in Asia: Perspectives from the social sciences\\", Cornell University press, . is an example of Barani land. Not all the Barani lands are part of the Bagar tract. Some of Brani areas nowadays are dependent on the tubewells for irrigation wherever groundwater level is not too low, hence technically they can now be termed as Chahi even though their legal classification in land revenue records may still be Barani. * Nahri is any canal-irrigated land, for example, the Rangoi tract is a Nahri area because it is irrigated by the Rangoi canal made for the purpose of carrying flood waters of Ghagghar river to the dry bangar areas.1987, \\"gazetteer of India: Hisar District\\" , page 7.1987, \\"Gazeteers of Hisar district, 1987\\" , Government of Haryana, page 162.] For the Nahri lands, Warabandi is a roaster of water to be drawn from a canal by each farmer for irrigating their land. Chak, based on British Raj era revenue collection system, is the land revenue settlement/assessment circle marking a contiguous block of land,Technical terms in land revenue and law. which has also become synonymous with the name of village founded by migrant farmers within the revenue circle.Randhir Singh, Sir William Roberts, 1932, An economic survey of Kala Gaddi Thamman (Chak 73 g. b. ) a village in the Lyallpur District of the Punjab. * Chahi is any land that is irrigated through wells/tube wells. Chahi Khalis is the land irrigated only by the well. Chahi Nahri is the land partly irrigated by the well and partly by the canal. Chahi Sailab is the land within Kadhir areas which is partly irrigated by the well and partly by the floods. Chahi Taal or Taal is land irrigated by johad (pond). =Related terms= Zamindar (landlord) is the Indian legal term for the owner of land. Both Bangar and Kadhir land can also be classified based on the type of land use: * Banjar is any uncultivated land. Kalar is barren land.  Banjar Jadid is any new fallow land that has been left uncultivated for the last four harvests.  Banjar Kadid is the old fallow land that has been left uncultivated for the last eight harvests. * Jangal is any uncultivated land covered with brushwood and small trees. Whereas Bir land means a nature reserve. * Abadi is any inhabited area on any type of land [including the Gair Mumkin land where cultivation is not possible] and Abadi Deh is any inhabited area on the cultivatable land. Abadi is a Urdu word which means a population,usually a large one, hence the name of the type of land. * Gair Mumkin is any non- cultivable land, such as hills, parts of foothills, or mountains. * Shamlat (‡§∂‡§æ‡§Æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§§), land that belongs to the community, jointly owned by the villagers in proportion to their land ownership of the cultivatable land and it is usually left uncultivated for the community usage, such as grazing or for building future facilities like schools, dispensary, johad, etc. Shamlat Deh (‡§∂‡§æ‡§Æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§§ ‡§¶‡•á‡§π) is the community land jointly belonging to all land owners of the village.  Shamlat Panna (‡§∂‡§æ‡§Æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§§ ‡§™‡§æ‡§®‡§æ) is the community land belonging to all land owners of a panna in a village, whereas pana itself is a habitation subdivision of villagers in Jat villages,A.R. Desai, 1994, Rural Sociology in India, page 716. which is also called Shamlat Patti (‡§∂‡§æ‡§Æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§§ ‡§™‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡•Ä) in the non- Jat villages. It is also called as Taraf (towards/direction). * Shamlat Thola (‡§∂‡§æ‡§Æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§§ ‡§†‡•ã‡§≤‡§æ) is the community land belonging to a thola in a village, which is a habitation subdivision of panna in the Jat villages usually made up of people belonging to the same gotra lineage. Shamlat Thola is also called Shamlat Thok (‡§∂‡§æ‡§Æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§§ ‡§†‡•ã‡§ï) in the non-Jat villages. =Other useful terms = Other useful terms in the measurement of land in Haryana and Punjab are Bigha, Khasra, Patwari (Village accountant), Shajra, Zaildar, Manish faujdar, etc. Doab A map of the Punjab region ca. 1947 showing the different doabs. Since North India are coursed by a multiplicity of Himalayan rivers that divide the plains into doabs (i.e. regions between two rivers), the Indo- Gangetic plains consist of alternating regions of river, khadir and bangar. The centers of the doabs consist of bangar and the peripheries, which line the rivers, consist of khadir. Historically, villages in the doabs have been officially classified as khadir, khadir-bangar (i.e. mixed) or bangar for many centuries and different agricultural tax rates applied based on a tiered land- productivity scale. In some areas, these terms have become incorporated in several village names themselves, such as Murshidpur Bangar and Ranchi Bangar- Khadir in Mathura district of Uttar Pradesh. Other places include Chilla Saroda Bangar, Gharonda Neemka Bangar, Pehlad Pur Bangar, Rampur Bangar and Salarpur Khadar.

The concert was recorded, but was not issued until 2010, when it was released as a 5-CD box set. Arrangement The Concert was underwritten by Tony Stratton-Smith, founder of Charisma Records, who had just taken over Zig Zag Magazine from its founder Pete Frame, although Frame remained as a writer. The selected acts were favourites of Frame and the other ZigZag journalists; John Tobler, Andy Childs, and Connor McKnight. Andrew Lauder arranged and paid for Vic Maile to record the concert. In addition to the 5 acts featured on the CD, Bristol folksinger Aj Webber, also played, but was not recorded.

ZigZag's Pete Frame was later to become their manager. ;Track listing Excluding song introductions, which the CD lists as separate tracks #\\"Going Down\\" (McGeeney) #\\"Nobody Home\\" (Poole) #\\"Never Say Too Late\\" (Whitmore) #\\"Down the Street\\" (McGeeney) #\\"Money is no Friend of Mine\\" (Poole) #\\"Everybody\\" (McGeeney) #\\"Oh What\\" (Poole) #\\"Chimes of Freedom\\" (Dylan) #\\"50/50 (Better Stop Now)\\" (Whitmore) #\\"Living in London\\" (McGeeney/Poole) ;Personnel *Tony Poole - Guitar, Vocals *Ross McGeeney - Guitar, Vocals *Iain Whitmore - Bass, Vocals *Nick Brown - Drums, Vocals CD2 - Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers were well known on the London pub-rock circuit, but it is felt that they never captured \\"the magical ambiance of their best live shows on record\\". This, their only official live recording, was made shortly before they recorded Bongos Over Balham. Having met the band at this concert, Michael Nesmith produced five tracks at the Bongos recording session, although only two tracks appeared on the final album. ;Track listing Excluding song introductions, which the CD lists as separate tracks #\\"I'll Be Home\\" (Philip Charles Lithman) #\\"The Streets of Baltimore\\" (Tompall Glaser, Harlan Howard) #\\"Papa and Mama Had Love\\" (Doug Kershaw) #\\"Midnight Bus\\" (Jesse Winchester) #\\"Older Guys\\" (Gram Parsons, Chris Hillman, Bernie Leadon) #\\"Desert Island Woman\\" (Philip Charles Lithman) #\\"Friday Song\\" (Philip Charles Lithman) #\\"Goodbye Nashville, Hello Camden Town\\" (Philip Charles Lithman) #\\"Walkin' Blues\\" (Robert Johnson) #\\"Just Like the Devil\\" (Traditional; arranged by Martin Stone) #\\"Boppin' the Blues\\" (Carl Perkins, Howard \\"Curly\\" Griffin) #\\"Choo Choo Ch'Boogie\\" (Vaughn Horton, Denver Darling, Milt Gabler) #\\"Fire on the Mountain\\" (Traditional; arranged by Chilli Willi) #\\"Drunken Sunken Redneck Blues\\"(Philip Charles Lithman) #\\"Six Days on the Road\\" (Earl Green, Carl Montgomery) ;Personnel *Phil \\"Snakefinger\\" Lithman - Guitar, Steel Guitar, Vocals *Martin Stone - Guitar, Vocals *Paul \\"Bassman\\" Riley - Bass, Vocals *Paul \\"Dice Man\\" Bailey - Guitar, Banjo, Sax, Vocals *Pete Thomas - Drums, Percussion *Will Stallibrass - Harmonica CD3 - John Stewart John Stewart and his bass player Arnie Moore flew in from the US for the concert and borrowed Chilli Willi's drummer Pete Thomas.

Regional tectonics The tectonic setting of the Molucca Sea region is unique. It is the only global example of an active arc-arc collision consuming an oceanic basin via subduction in two directions. The Molucca Sea Plate has been subsumed by tectonic microplates, the Halmahera Plate and the Sangihe Plate. The whole complexity is now known as the Molucca Sea Collision Zone. The existence of Sangihe as a tectonic plate separate from the Molucca Sea Plate is not yet entirely agreed upon by geologists. Some see Sangihe as a western slab of the Molucca Sea Plate, just as they regard Halmahera as an eastern slab of the Molucca Sea Plate. What is apparent to date is that Sangihe was part of the Molucca Sea slab subducted during the Neogene between 45 Ma and 25 Ma.R. Hall and W. Spakman, Australian Plate Tomography and Tectonics in R.

Both Sangihe and Halmahera are exposed to the surface while the Molucca Sea plate is completely subsumed below these two microplates. The southern boundary of the Molucca Sea Plate is also the boundary of the Philippine Sea Plate and the Australian Plate, and is moving northwards. Since the Sangihe Plate and the Halmahera Plate are in continuity with the Molucca Sea Plate, this implies all three slabs are moving northward in mantle with the Australian Plate.

Perspectives In 2011 Zuckerberg advocated for the abolition of anonymity on the Internet to protect children and young adults from cyber-bullying. Zuckerberg explained how anonymity is protective for perpetrators.\\"People behave a lot better when they have their real names down ... I think people hide behind anonymity and they feel like they can say whatever they want behind closed doors.\\" Personal life Zuckerberg and her husband Brent Tworetzky have two sons.

He started his career with West Bromwich Albion, whom he joined as an amateur in November 1920. In March 1921, Bedford signed professional terms with the club but made only three senior appearances for the side before joining Walsall in 1922. In the first of four spells with Walsall, Bedford played 97 league matches before joining Sheffield Wednesday in August 1925 for a transfer fee of ¬£575 (¬£ as of ). He scored 2 goals in 11 appearances for the Hillsborough outfit as they won the Football League Second Division at the end of the 1925‚Äì26 campaign. In the summer of 1926, Bedford returned to Walsall for a fee of ¬£200 (¬£ as of ). He played a total of 26 matches and scored 3 goals for the side before moving to Football League Third Division North rivals Nelson midway through the season. He made his Nelson debut on 12 March 1927, scoring twice in the 7‚Äì0 victory away at Accrington Stanley. Bedford kept his place in the team for the remainder of the campaign, and added to his goal tally with strikes against Barrow and Chesterfield. He remained the club's first-choice outside left going into the 1927‚Äì28 season and scored the winning goal in a 2‚Äì1 win away at Southport on 17 September.Dykes (2009), p. 81 Bedford lost his starting berth following the 1‚Äì9 defeat to Bradford City, Nelson's heaviest defeat during their ten seasons in the Football League, on 12 November 1927. He was recalled to the side three matches later, and scored his last Nelson goal in the 1‚Äì1 draw with Tranmere Rovers on 27 December. His last appearance for the Seedhill club came two games later, in the 1‚Äì6 loss to Crewe Alexandra on 1 January 1928. The following month, Bedford returned to Walsall for a third spell with the club. His stay was short however, as he scored once in 16 league matches before moving to Luton Town two months later. While at Luton, he played alongside fellow former Nelson players John Black and Harry Abbott, and enjoyed the most prolific goal-scoring period of his professional career, netting 15 goals in 49 appearances for the Bedfordshire club. In December 1929, he moved back to Walsall for a fourth and final time, but did not feature regularly for the first team. He was restricted to six league matches before leaving in 1931 to move into non-league football with the Bloxwich Strollers. Bedford went on to play amateur football until the age of 40, eventually retiring in June 1940 following a spell with Walsall Wood. After football, he worked as a foreman for a mineral water company.

A number of Plaetorii appear in history during the first and second centuries BC, but none of this gens ever obtained the consulship. Several Plaetorii issued denarii from the late 70s into the 40s, of which one of the best known alludes to the assassination of Caesar on the Ides of March, since one of the Plaetorii was a partisan of Pompeius during the Civil War.Crawford, Roman Republican Coinage, pp. 83, 86, 87, 408, 415, 418. Origin Chase classifies the nomen Plaetorius among those gentilicia which were either of Roman origin, or which at least cannot be shown to have originated anywhere else, implying that the name is apparently of Latin derivation. Some scholars have suggested that the Plaetorii hailed from the ancient city of Tusculum in Latium.Chase, pp. 129‚Äì132.Wiseman, New Men in the Roman Senate, p. 251. Praenomina The main praenomina of the Plaetorii were Marcus, Gaius, and Lucius, the three most common names throughout Roman history. Branches and cognomina The only distinct family of the Plaetorii under the Republic bore the cognomen Cestianus, probably indicating that they were originally adopted from the Cestii, a family of Praeneste. Their coins allude both to their name, depicting an athlete holding a cestus, and to a Praenestine origin, depicting Sors, the god of luck, associated with the renowned Praenestine oracle.McCartney, \\"Casting Puns on Ancient Monuments\\", p. 62.Crawford, Roman Republican Coinage, p. 418.

He was the son of a Dutch father Johannes Hermanus Josephus de Hoog, employed in the Dutch East Indies Navy, and Indo (Eurasian) mother Susanna Beekman. He was married to the Indo Chinese Kiong Nio Oei (1874‚Äì1961). The couple had two adoptive children. ING (Institute for Dutch History) - Biography overview. P.1 After an expeditious and successful professional career Dick de Hoog went into politics and became the undisputed leader of the Indo Europeesch Verbond (English: Indo European Alliance), the most important Indo emancipation movement of the time. As its representative he became a professional politician and full-time member of the Dutch East Indies 'Volksraad', an infant form of parliament . He successfully united all Indo social layers and built the largest Indo organisation in the Dutch East Indies. His organisation became the biggest political fraction represented in the People's Assembly fighting for race equality and a self-sufficient and independent nation, albeit as a dominion in a larger Dutch commonwealth. A beloved and popular figure among Indos in the Dutch East Indies he became the face and voice of Indo emancipation. Emerging as the IEV's charismatic leader he was a champion of Indo interests in the Dutch East Indies until his death in 1939.Meijer, Hans 'Hoog, Frederik Hermanus de (1881-1939)', in 'Biografisch Woordenboek van Nederland.' ING - Institute for Dutch History Social career De Hoog was the youngest of 5 children. Due to the death of his father when he was still an infant toddler the family was unable to afford appropriate schooling for the brilliant and inquisitive boy. Fortunately a scholarship granted by the Freemasons lodge enabled De Hoog to graduate cum laude at the Surabaya HBS at 16. He started his professional career as a clerk in Surabaya and at age 19 joined the State Railway company. Within a few years he was promoted to chief of its main cargo freight station. By 1905 he was station chief in Jombang, where his career halted due to the fact that the highest job positions in the Dutch East Indies were restricted to people educated in the Netherlands and were usually occupied by expatriate Dutchmen. With the financial help from a friend, the already married De Hoog, was able to pursue an academic education in the Netherlands in 1914. In record time he graduated from Leiden University in 1916. The next year he and his wife traveled back to the Dutch East Indies via the United States. In Batavia he became the right-hand man of the director of the State Railway company and in 1922 its principal officer in Jogjakarta. In 1925 he was promoted again and moved to Bandung as Inspector First Class. Political career Opening ceremony of the Volksraad, Batavia, Dutch East Indies, 1930. Meanwhile, De Hoog had also commenced his political career and soon became the main leader of the IEV (Indo European Alliance), the most important Indo emancipation movement of the time. Founded by Karel Zaalberg in 1919 De Hoog joined the IEV board of directors in 1920. In 1922 he became its vice-president and in 1923 its representative in the Volksraad an infant form of parliament. When in 1927 he joined the 'Board of Delegates', responsible for the daily administration of the 'Volksraad', he requested honorable discharge of his job with the State Railway organisation. De Hoog was now totally dedicated to his political aspirations. After initially having a two-headed presidency De Hoog became the IEV's sole President in 1929. That same year De Hoog, lovingly nicknamed the 'Big Boss', was responsible for successfully attracting close to 15,000 members. In 1930 he became deputy chairman of the 'Board of Delegates' and vice chairman of the 'Volksraad'. By now the IEV had grown into the largest political fraction in the 'Volksraad'. In his political functions De Hoog proved to be a skillful administrator, shrewd politician and excellent orator. Both friend and foe praised his immaculate memory, subject matter knowledge, discretion and strong work ethic. De Hoog considered solidarity essential to further emancipation and his first priority was to ensure unity within all social layers of the Indo community of the plural and polarized Dutch East Indies. Under his leadership the organisation struggled to acquire both civil rights for natives of the colony as well as increased self-determination for the Dutch East Indies. The colonial authorities however continued to procrastinate democratic progress and the Dutch East Indies remained considerably more centralised and conservative than the Netherlands. Key issues like uplifting the ban on land ownership for Indos and autonomy for the colony were never resolved. Final years In 1938 the IEV celebrated De Hoog's 10 years as president and a social fund was named after him. He was at the height of his fame and had acquired significant nicknames such as the 'uncrowned King of the IEV' and the 'Indo general'. His health however started failing and after several heart failures he suffered a fatal stroke at age 57. His death in 1939 was front-page news in both the Dutch East Indies and the Netherlands and his burial in Bandung was an impressive event paying homage to his work for the Indo community. Although during his lifetime he was widely acknowledged as the undisputed leader of the IEV and a popular and respected champion of Indo emancipation in the Dutch East Indies, his organisation was unable to build up enough influence to reverse the ongoing marginalisation of the vulnerable Indo community. After the great change of paradigm during WWII the IEV was unable to surmount the vicissitudes of the clash between Dutch colonialism and the Indonesian independence movement.Postma, Ulbe: Karel Zaalberg, journalist en strijder voor de Indo.

It also consists the last episode of the season. It originally aired on May 13, 2010. The episode was written by Bryan Oh and Andrew Chambliss and directed by Marcos Siega. Plot Everybody gets ready for the Founder's Day parade and gets dressed up in period outfits, including Elena (Nina Dobrev), something that makes her look like Katherine even more. Damon (Ian Somerhalder) tells Stefan (Paul Wesley) that he does not need to worry since he will not steal his girlfriend. Anna (Malese Jow) shows up in Jeremy's (Steven R. McQueen) room to tell him that John (David Anders) was the one who killed her mother and she wants to leave town. She gives Jeremy a vial with her blood telling him that she could turn him to go with her if he wanted to but Jeremy changed his mind since the first time he asked her to turn him. Elena is shocked by the news Stefan told her; that John is her birth father. Elena wonders if she has to confront him and ask him if it is true while she is also worried if Jeremy will ever forgive her. She tries to talk to him but Jeremy tells her to go to hell, something that Damon catches from afar. He follows Jeremy and aggressively tries to tell him not to treat Elena that way. Stefan interferes, apologizing to Jeremy for everything that happened, but Jeremy still does not feel like forgiving Elena. Tyler (Michael Trevino) tries to make up with Matt (Zach Roerig) but Matt is still mad at him. Caroline (Candice Accola) tries to talk Matt into forgiving Tyler but he cuts her off. Meanwhile, Damon thanks Bonnie (Kat Graham) for removing the spell from the Gilbert device that could have killed him. While the parade is in progress, John explains to Mayor Lockwood (Robert Pralgo) the plan of how they will use the device to find the vampires, who plan to attack the town in the night, and kill them. When the device is activated, it will produce a high pitched sound that humans will not be able to hear and it will force the vampires to reveal themselves. The council's team will inject them with vervain and gather them all together at the old Gilbert office, where they will burn them. Sheriff Forbes (Marguerite MacIntyre) enters and she does not agree with John's plan to use the town as a bait since their children will be among the crowd. John asks to talk along to the Sheriff. He knocks her out and handcuffs her to the ventilation pipes while at the same time, the tomb vampires plan their attack when Anna shows up. Anna comes to Damon to inform him that the tomb vampires are already in the town planning to attack when the fireworks go off and their target is the founding families. She only met with them earlier to find out their plan. Damon figures out that John is planning to use the device but because he still thinks that the device will not work, he runs to find Alaric (Matt Davis) and ask for his help. He also tells Elena and Stefan about the vampires being there and asks Stefan to take Elena out of town. The two of them run to find Jeremy while Damon leaves to find John. The Mayor gets into the Grill looking for Tyler. He asks him to go home but when Tyler ignores him, his father becomes aggressive. Matt and Caroline interfere taking Tyler's side and the Mayor, calmer, politely asks Tyler to go home and take his friends with him, handing him over his car keys. Anna also finds Jeremy at the Grill and tries to explain to him everything that is going on. Back at the celebration, the Mayor gives a speech about the 150th anniversary of their town and gives the signal for the fireworks to start, while the vampires wait to start their attack and John waits to activate the device. Damon walks into the old Gilbert office to confront John, but John activates the device and Damon collapses. John injects him with vervain. At the same time, the vampires outside start to collapse too with the council's team finding them and injecting them with vervain. Stefan collapses too but Alaric gets there in time to direct the deputy to another vampire and help Elena take Stefan away. Anna does not have the same luck, since they find her and take her away while she is with Jeremy and before she manages to completely tell him what is going on. Mayor Lockwood also collapses because of the sound and is taken away. Tyler, Matt and Caroline are on their way home when John activates the device. Tyler hears the noise and loses control of the car, which crashes into a gate. The paramedics get to the scene and examine the unconscious Tyler. His pulse is steady but when the paramedic tries to examine his eyes, they don't look human. Tyler wakes up and his eyes are back to normal. Caroline, who seemed perfectly fine before, collapses. John deactivates the device since the deputies have found all the vampires, while Alaric, Stefan and Elena realize what is going on and that Bonnie did not remove the spell from the device. They wonder where Damon is and Elena asks Alaric to find Jeremy and take him home while she and Stefan run to find Damon. They run into John who has already put a fire on the basement of the old Gilbert office to burn the vampires. Meanwhile, at the basement, Damon spots the Mayor among the prisoners and wonders why he is there. Damon can see that vervain did not affect him, which means that he is not a vampire, but he cannot understand what he is. The Mayor tries to get away from Damon but he gets closer to the leader of the tomb vampires who breaks his neck. At the same time, Mrs. Lockwood finds Sheriff Forbes and frees her from the handcuffs informing her that the deputies have taken her husband and she doesn't know why or where they took him. John dares Stefan to try and save his brother since he is certain that he will not make it out alive. Elena attempts to follow Stefan and John stops her. Elena tells him that as her father should care about the people she loves and cares about, something that surprises John. John's surprise makes Elena sure that he is her father and she leaves to help Damon. Bonnie stops Stefan right before he enters the burning building warning him that the fire will kill him but Stefan gets in anyway. Bonnie then stops Elena but when she sees that Elena will go in anyway, she starts chanting while holding her to prevent her from getting in. The spell calms the fire long enough for Stefan to get to Damon and help him get out. Elena and Stefan meet a little later at the Grill where Elena reassures Stefan that she loves him and not Damon, even though she cares about him. Damon goes to Jeremy's room to inform him about Anna's death and that he wanted to help her but he could not. He knows that Jeremy must be in pain and he offers to take the pain away like he did before but this time it will be his choice. Jeremy tells him that even if he erased his memory the pain is still there and compelling him again will not take the pain away now either. Jeremy asks if what Anna told him, that vampires can turn off their humanity and do not feel, is true and Damon says that it is. Vampires can turn off their humanity and that makes life easier but not better. Damon leaves and Jeremy drinks Anna's blood that she brought him earlier. He then finds a bottle of Elena's old painkillers and takes them. At the hospital, Sheriff tells Matt and Tyler that Caroline is bleeding internally and the doctors are taking her into surgery while she also tells Tyler about his father and that he should call his mother to tell her. Meanwhile back in town, Bonnie runs into Stefan and explains to him that she only saved him and Damon because of Elena. Bonnie promises Stefan that if Damon will not change and he hurts one more person, she will take him down even if that means she will have to take Stefan down as well. Elena comes home and finds Damon on his way out. The two of them have a talk with Damon opening up and thanking her for saving him today. They end up kissing when Jenna (Sara Canning) opens the door and sees them. Jenna orders Elena to come inside and she closes the door behind her asking Elena what is she doing but Elena does not want to talk about it. John is in the kitchen when Elena shows up. John tries to tell her how he met Isobel and how turning her into a vampire changed her completely when Elena grabs a knife and cuts off his fingers, severing him from his ring. John realizes that this is not Elena but Katherine but it is too late to do anything and Katherine stabs him in the stomach. The episode ends with real Elena coming back home talking with Stefan on the phone and telling him that someone took her clothes from her locker. She gets into the house to check on Jeremy before she leaves for the hospital to see Caroline when she hears a noise from the kitchen and she heads there.

Matt Richenthal from TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.9/5. \\"Wow. What a season finale! Producers had promised us a bunch of cliffhangers and they delivered. [...] Indeed, it was a stunning conclusion to what had been a somewhat meandering, disappointing episode. But that all changed with the thrust of Katherine's knife.\\" Josie Kafka of Doux Reviews rated the episode with 4/4. \\"I really didn‚Äôt see the Elena/Katherine fake-out coming. I was surprised that Elena kissed Damon, but it was so very darn sexy that I thought maybe she just got caught up in the moment. Even when she grabbed the knife, I still wasn‚Äôt sure. It wasn‚Äôt until she cut off all of Sark‚Äôs fingers that I realized Elena would probably not have the nerve to do something so gory with her aunt and brother in the house.\\" Diana Steenbergen from IGN rated the episode with 9/10 saying that the show has turned into one of the better guilty pleasures on TV and that the cliffhangers are plentiful at the end of the hour. \\"One of the great things about The Vampire Diaries is the pacing. The storylines move at breakneck speed; a conflict is introduced one week, it is resolved the next and a new conflict crops up. The big ticket items this week are Elena finding out who her father really is, Bonnie admitting that she did not remove the power of Johnathan Gilbert's device, and Damon's newfound humanity. Each storyline is suitably addressed in the hour, and as usual, new problems present themselves by the end.\\" Steenbergen also praised Somerhalder, saying that is the best part of the show: \\"He is ridiculously entertaining as Damon, the sometime evil Salvatore brother. Damon has a bit of an advantage on poor Stefan, since it is so much fun to watch the snarky, obnoxious behavior Damon dishes out to everyone.\\" Robin Franson Pruter of Forced Viewing rated the episode with 4/4 saying that the episode was satisfying on every level. \\"An exciting, engrossing end to the first season, \\"Founder‚Äôs Day\\" stands as a paragon of the serialized drama season finale. [...] We, the viewers, are left staring at the screen in mute astonishment, until it dawns on us that we‚Äôll have to wait three months in breathless anticipation of the next season‚Äôs premiere.\\" Franson Pruter also commented on Dobrev's acting as Elena/Katherine saying that she was impressed: \\"I‚Äôm really impressed with Nina Dobrev in this episode. As much as I was fooled along with Damon and Jenna by Katherine‚Äôs masquerade during the porch scene, watching this episode again, I can see Dobrev using gestures and expressions we will come to associate with Katherine.\\" Meg of Two Cents TV gave a good review to the episode saying that it was amazing and the season was eventful and incredible. \\"Holy crap! Holy crap! I‚Äôm still reeling from the last five minutes of tonight‚Äôs season finale. It‚Äôs (finally!) Founder‚Äôs Day in Mystic Falls, and with it comes murder, mutilation, mayhem, and one helluva cliffhanger!\\" Jen Yamato from HitFix gave a good review to the episode saying that the season finale went out with a bang. \\"Completing an incredibly strong 22-episode run, \\"The Vampire Diaries\\" ended its first season not just with a bang, but with an explosive, fiery, violent, sexy bang that tied up some story threads and created other deliciously unexpected ones. This was an episode that gave a lot to fans, a tense piece of storytelling that offered plenty of hints and foreshadowing and delivered on clues dropped throughout the season.\\" Popsugar of Buzzsugar also gave a good review to the episode stating: \\"I can barely express my grief that The Vampire Diaries is over for the season ‚Äî but what an insane season finale! Also causing me grief? The three, and possibly more, deaths that we witness on Founder's Day!\\" Mark O. Estes from TV Overmind gave a good review to the episode saying that the show \\"killed it tonight\\" leaving him can't wait for the new season.

During World War II, New Zealand soldiers fought in the Battle of the Green Islands.BBC: Papua New Guinea In 1949, Australia established a joint administration over both territories called the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. In September 1975, Papua New Guinea obtained independence from Australia. Soon afterwards, New Zealand recognized and established diplomatic relations with Papua New Guinea. In December 1988, the Bougainville Civil War erupted in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville when a group calling itself the Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) led a movement for secession by the island from Papua New Guinea.Papua New Guinea: History New Zealand played a role by hosting Papua New Guinean government officials and separatists for peace talks. In October 1997, following talks in Christchurch, a truce was signed between the new government and many of the Bougainville separatists. An unarmed Truce Monitoring Group (TMG) led by New Zealand and supported by Australia, Fiji and Vanuatu was subsequently deployed. In January 1998 the Lincoln Agreement was signed and New Zealand was witness to the 2001 Bougainville Peace Agreement which ended the conflict.MFAT: About Papua New Guinea New Zealand and Papua New Guinea are active members of the Pacific Islands Forum. There have been numerous visits by leaders of both nations with recent visits including New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern visiting Port Moresby in November 2018 to attend the 30th APEC summit.MFAT: Papua New Guinea In February 2020, Papua New Guinean Prime Minister James Marape paid a four-day state visit to New Zealand.PNG PM makes rare visit to NZ to 'elevate' friendship Since 2001, Papua New Guinea has been host to the Manus Regional Processing Centre on Manus Island established by Australia as a Pacific Solution aimed at stopping maritime arrivals of asylum seekers to Australia. In recent years, New Zealand has offered to take refugees who had been stuck on Manus Island. The New Zealand and Papua New Guinea governments wanted this offer to materialize, however, Australia wouldn't allow it, warning it could create an incentive for future asylum seekers to get in to Australia through a back door. Trade In 2018, trade between both nations totaled NZ$257 million dollars. New Zealand's main exports to Papua New Guinea include: electrical machinery and equipment, meat products, dairy produce and animal products.

Jim Davis, a good mechanic who irresponsibly drinks and gambles too much, is fired by his friend, but atones with a heroic act during a fire. Alperson's rival crew is getting jobs by under-bidding Joe's. A farmer's flirtatious niece, Fay Rankin, finds a field for Joe's workers and then unsuccessfully tries to seduce him. She wants to come along and sets her sights on Jim instead, marrying him. Fay's interference becomes a problem. Joe ends up owing money and Alperson tries to buy his combines. Fay makes another play for Joe, who calls her \\"cheap\\" and \\"poisonous.\\" Jim catches her slapping Joe, which leads to a fight between the men. Joe's loyal crew member King catches thievery of wheat by Jim and reports it. Joe, almost broke, is saved again by a penitent Jim, who sells Fay's car, enraging her. Fay finally reveals to Jim that she never loved him at all and that their marriage was a \\"joke.\\" Joe and Jim team up on a new 3,000-acre job, making them prosperous at last.

It was bought by Paramount in May 1946 specifically as a vehicle for Alan Ladd. A. I. Bezzerides was hired to work on the script. Tay Garnett signed to direct and Brian Donlevy was originally announced as Ladd's co star. Before a final script and cast had been confirmed, second unit filming commenced in July 1946 at the Russell Giffen ranch, 47 miles north of Fresno in the San Joaquin Valley. Tay Garnett and the film crew shot footage of a real wheat harvest involving 27 combines and Alan Ladd. Female lead Dorothy Lamour was not cast until August. William Demarest also joined in the cast. Eventually Donlevy was replaced by Lloyd Nolan, who was borrowed from 20th Century Fox. Demarest dropped out and Robert Preston was cast as the third lead. The cast included a 28-year-old Caren Marsh‚Äîa bit-part actor who had appeared in a Paramount training film warning military personnel against the dangers of women. So many navy and army men wrote in asking for Marsh's picture that Paramount signed her to a long-term contract; Wild Harvest was her first appearance. Filming was meant to start on 2 September 1946 but was postponed a day so Alan Ladd could enjoy his birthday. Filming did not finish until November 1946, ten days behind schedule, causing production of Ladd's next film, Saigon, to be postponed. The film was retitled Wild Harvest in December. The wheat field fire was filmed in part by using miniatures and special effects. These were overseen by Byron Haskin, his last assignment in that capacity for Paramount before he became a director.

It was directed by Tay Garnett. Plot London, 1918: In a gentlemen's club, General Brunswick regales junior officers celebrating a British advance in France with the tale of how he won his brigade command during his service in India, not with gallantry under fire but under circumstances that warranted a court martial. As the longtime colonel of 1st Battalion, the Rutlandshire Regiment, an infantry unit, Brunswick had a trusted aide, Capt. Pindenny, and the service of three able but not always reliable privates, Ackroyd, Malloy and Sykes, who for his eighteen years as commander were \\"the Queen's hard bargain\\", sneaking off to drink, fight and gamble whenever they could. Against their wishes, one man must be elevated to sergeant to separate them and Ackroyd is the unhappy choice. Sent from their garrison at Hyderalipore to provide a show of force at a reported disturbance in Mirzabad, Brunswick and his battalion are recalled and placed under rival Colonel Groat of the 28th Hussars and his officious adjutant, Major Mercer. A rift develops between the three friends after Ackroyd's promotion, but it is mended after he saves Sykes' life. Sykes and Malloy become part of a small force under Mercer and Pindenny to an abandoned fort at Imara as a sacrificial lure to entrap the insurgent forces of Manik Rao. Ackroyd is left behind and apparently becomes a deserter. Groat separates his command and Brunswick uses it as an opportunity to ignore Groat's order to return to his garrison post and take his battalion to Imara. At Imara the fort is attacked by Manik Rao and overrun, with the British survivors taking refuge in its powder house. Manik Rao threatens to blow them up if they do not surrender. Ackroyd enters the fort in disguise, slays Manik Rao, and saves the lives of the trapped British troops. Brunswick expects to be court-martialed but finds he was goaded by Groat into acting as he did to avoid officially starting a war. Groat \\"suggests\\" that Brunswick led his command in pursuit of the deserter Ackroyd and Brunswick is promoted instead. Ackroyd's \\"punishment\\" for desertion, on the other hand, is to be demoted back to private as he wished.

A film crew was sent to India under Geoffrey Barkas to shoot second unit footage. A script had been written based on \\"The Courting of Dinah Shadd\\" and Lung Tung Pen\\" and involve a climax especially written by Kipling involving a battle at the Khyber Pass. The battle was shot with army cooperation. Michael Balcon of Gaumont then set about trying to secure a cast. He visited Hollywood and said he was interested in Pat O'Brien to play the lead. Then Richard Dix, Maureen O'Sullivan and C. Aubrey Smith were all mentioned as possible stars. Gordon Harker was also announced as a lead. Smith actually travelled to England to make the movie, but wound up appearing in Trans-Atlantic Tunnel instead. Soldiers Three was postponed.

Los Angeles Times, 30 September 1950: 9. The bulk of the story was taken from Kipling's \\"The Incarnation of Krishna Mulvaney\\". Pandro S. Berman told the New York Times he was aware the story was politically tricky: > We are making a rough and tumble brawling comedy with three British soldiers > out of a Kipling work as major characters and that presents major problems. > The people of India hated Kipling. As to the British, how they will react > when we show three roistering, drunken Tommies on the screen is a question. > When I produced Gunga Din at RKO in 1938 it was banned in India and efforts > were made to stop it being shown in the British Isles. But if we were to > film Soldiers Three to please either Britain or India we would have to make > it much too dull to for our much bigger audience here at home. Nonetheless Berman insisted on the creation of a new character, Gobind Lal, a peaceful Indian, who was not in the Kipling original, although care was taken that Lal did not resemble Mahatma Gandhi too closely. The final scene was altered so that Indian rebels laid down their arms to indicate their support of passive resistance. Berman also arranged for Mulvaney's irreverence to the Hindu god Krishna to be removed so as not to offend Indians. Further changes were made when it was realised that Granger could not do an Irish accent ‚Äì the character of Mulvaney was changed to the Cockney \\"Ackroyd\\" (Granger could do Cockney). Once this change was made, Berman decided that the other two lead characters should also have their names changed, to Malloy and Sykes, to emphasise that the work was more of an MGM original than derived from Kipling.HOLLYWOOD ISSUE: DANGER LURKS BEHIND THE SWINGING DOORS By THOMAS F. BRADY. New York Times, 26 November 1950: X5. Filming started October 1950. During the filming of a barroom brawl scene, a balcony collapsed and two stunt men were hospitalised.

Trying to restore equilibrium with jokes and > gags was like trying to cure bubonic plague with warm beer. Stewart Granger later said he enjoyed working with stuntman Yakima Canutt on the film, \\"but the script. Oh dear! If Metro had planned to ruin my career they couldn't have chosen a better subject.\\" Reception According to MGM records the movie earned $1,016,000 in the US and Canada and $1,221,000 overseas, making a profit of $23,000.

Enterprise social networking focuses on the use of online social networks or social relations among people who share business interests and/or activities. Enterprise social networking is often a facility of enterprise social software (regarded as a primary component of Enterprise 2.0), which is essentially social software used in \\"enterprise\\" (business/commercial) contexts. It encompasses modifications to corporate intranets (referred to as social intranets) and other classic software platforms used by large companies to organize their communication, collaboration and other aspects of their intranets. Enterprise social networking is also generally thought to include the use of a standard external social networking service to generate visibility for an enterprise. History Social networking sites started to form in the 1990s; an example of these websites is Theglobe.com, which began in 1995. As other websites such as GeoCities and Tripod.com started to form online communities, they encouraged their users to interact with each other via chat rooms and other tools. They also provided easy-to-use publishing tools along with free web space. Classmates.com‚Äôs approach was to link people together via their emails, the website was like a friends search engine. Businesses eventually realized that social networking websites could provide a fast and efficient way of marketing. Social media websites are great places for businesses to reach their customers, and the environment can provide a means for growing a business. In 2005, as social networking websites were becoming more and more popular, Myspace had more page views than Google. Myspace was followed by Facebook which started in February 2004. When Facebook began, users were limited to college students in the United States, who had to use a college email with a .edu extension to join the network. In September 2005 some high schools were allowed to join the network, but they needed an invitation to join. On September 26 of 2006, Facebook announced that anyone around the world older than 13 years old with a valid email would be able to join Facebook‚Äôs online community. In October 2007, Microsoft purchased a 1.6% share of Facebook. That gave them the right to place international ads on Facebook. In July 2010 it was reported that Facebook had more than 500 million active users. This means that one out of fourteen people around the world is a Facebook user. The growth of Facebook was a boom in the social networking space. Facebook became a huge corporation that had 1400 employees in 2009; their estimated revenue was US$800 million in 2009. In 2010, it was reported that there were more than 200 social networking websites on the web.Get Connected: The Social Networking Toolkit for Business By Starr Hall, Chadd Rosenberg Over 200 social networking sites : InfoJuice website.

Different companies have embraced social networking and they are creating their own internal social networking sites. IBM is one example and they have created the Beehive research project, based on their Lotus Connections product.Geyer, Werner, Dugan, Casey, DiMicco, Joan, Millen, David R, Brownholtz, Beth and Muller, Michael (2008). Use and Reuse of Shared Lists as a Social Content Type.http://www-01.ibm.com/software/ucd/gallery/beehive_research.html Another example is Atos, which is deploying its in-house blueKiwi product across all 76,000 employees to achieve its Zero Email ambition by the end of 2013. Many companies are encouraging employees to use their social networks so they can connect with other employees, help people socialize when they take a break, or even help contribute to other work-related issues.DiMicco, Joan, Millen, David R., Geyer, Werner, Dugan, Casey, Brownholtz, Beth and Muller, Michael (2008). Motivations for Social Networking at Work. Some companies are even joining typical social networking sites like Facebook or MySpace to gain more clients, communicate with their clients, or target individuals based on their likes. These companies want to gain the trust of their clients.http://www.cio.com/article/481215/Social_Networking_at_Work_Fear_Not_Facebook_MySpace_and_Bebo_ Applications The year 2009 saw 92% of Inc. 500 companies using at least one social media channel, a dramatic increase over the 77% reported in 2008.http://blog.20dbs.com reporting data from http://www.inc.com Medpedia is one of about 70 medical wikis that allows physicians and researchers to share information.

Deloitte has been a pioneer in its use of the corporate social networking applications for consulting. Boral Limited was one of the first major building and construction materials companies in Australia to adopt Enterprise Social Networking using the Yammer platform.

In addition to using social networking to market the enterprise, companies are involving customers in the design process. Chicago company Threadless invites their customers to submit their T-shirt designs to the Threadless web site for review by other customers. Smart companies are also involving their customers in technical support using enterprise social networking.\\"Offering Tech Support Via Social Media: Too Impersonal?\\", 12 March 2014, Retrieved on 27 June 2014. eBay was an early adopter of the practice of allowing users to assist each other online.Chittoor, Vijay, 2010. Social Media: More than Creating Connections Issues =Lack of adoption= If training in the use of enterprise social networking tools is not provided to employees who do not have experience using them, they are unlikely to be widely adopted. The use of enterprise social networking must be championed at the highest levels of the enterprise to provide the resources needed and promote adoption throughout the organization. Gartner have said that only 10% of organisations see value in a social collaboration product, primarily due to the lack of change management provided during rollout. The lack of adoption is a complex issue with many theories put forward: =Transparency= The sharing of information across the enterprise through social networking creates a transparency that may or may not necessarily be welcomed by all sectors of the organization. =Perception= There is often an assumption that social networking will not work well in a particular industry or that its use may be perceived as unprofessional. In addition the ability to justify use of enterprise social networking, based on return on investment is not always readily apparent.Hinchclife, Dion, 2009. Ten top issues in adopting enterprise social computing. Members of traditional or conservative organisations perceive social networking as a time wasting tool. However once employees see usage by other employees, they often begin seeing the value and hence engaging and contributing content. =Privacy and security= Privacy issues associated with social networking sites can be seen from many perspectives. Some people will argue that this is just a part of globalization and the growth of technology, while others will still believe that it is a right for any citizen, and will never change their views and perspectives about their privacy. With the increase in popularity of social networking, many users have given up their personal privacy in order to join these networks. Social media privacy issues didn‚Äôt begin with social networking sites; they have historically been persistent issues with many other types of social media such as text messaging, instant messaging and computer-supported collaboration work. Oscar Gandy in 1993 claimed that in the age of digital media, people probably do not have any privacy. He stated that ‚Äúthe panoptic sort is an antidemocratic system of control that cannot be transformed because it can serve no purpose other than that for which it was designed ‚Äî the rationalization and control of human existence.‚Äù Gandy demanded creation of an agency that would ensure the survival of privacy.Gandy, Oscar H., 1993. The panoptic sort: A political economy of personal information. p. 227. From a policy perspective, according to Schement and Curtis (1994),Schement, Jorge Reina and Curtis, Terry, 1994. Tendencies and tensions of the information age: The production and distribution of information in the United States privacy is seen ‚Äúas security against intrusion by government‚Äù. According to Garfinkel (2000) ‚ÄúPrivacy isn‚Äôt just about hiding things. It‚Äôs about self‚Äìpossession, autonomy, and integrity.‚Äù Garfinkel, 2000, p. 4 Because social tools make many things that were normally private much more public, including all types of corporate data, many organizations would rather wait for best practices or to see what their peers are doing before delving very far into social networking. Privacy can become a huge issue at the enterprise level, when customer and employee data are at stake. Security concerns must be addressed prior to embarking upon creation of an enterprise social network. =Behavioral issues= One of the significant areas of concern with the use of social networking internally within organisations is the impact and effect of behavioral issues. As the interactions within a social network are loosely coupled to business process and structured information systems, the effect of individual personalities and human psychology become more pronounced within social networks. Such emerging concerns cover issues such as attention management, death by trivia, dominant personalities, behavioral adoption and influence strategies.Butler, Chester.

Plot A range war is building in Wyoming. Caught on opposite sides are Sam Brassfield, who builds fences to protect his grass land, and Clay Mathews, a cattle baron determined to keep an open range. Both men argue their case before the cattlemen's association to President Chester A. Arthur, who happens to be in Cheyenne for a visit. A hired gun of Mathews picks a fight with Brassfield's top man, Johnny Quatro, in a saloon, then vows revenge after Brassfield intervenes. Brassfield proposes marriage to Sharleen Travers, who runs a neighboring ranch with her brother Harry. At first the spineless Harry sides with Mathews, but after a scolding from his sister, he apologizes to Brassfield. A while thereafter, the hired gun Bodine shoots and wounds the unarmed Harry, then kills Sharleen in cold blood. Another rancher mistakenly blames Brassfield for a raid that Matthews ordered. He changes sides after overhearing Brassfield speak on his behalf to the President. In a final showdown, Brassfield urges Mathews to keep the dispute between themselves, then outdraws Mathews in a gunfight. Bodine also pulls a gun, but Quatro shoots him down.

Hang Ten products are sold in many countries around the world, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Brazil, Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, China, Singapore, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Cambodia, Pakistan and South Africa. History Hang Ten was founded in 1960 in Seal Beach, California by Doris Moore and Duke Boyd, as a maker of surfing apparel. It branched into other sports apparel, and helped develop the action-sports apparel industry. Boyd sold Hang Ten in 1970. The brand was bought by Hong Kong-based conglomerate Li & Fung in 2012.

This type of micro-fluidic biochip is based upon the principle of microfluidics; to take advantage of noninertial pumping for lab-on-a-chip devices using noninertial valves and switches under centrifugal force and Coriolis effect to distribute fluids about the disks in a highly parallel order. This biodisk is an integration of multiple technologies in different areas. The designer must be familiar with the process of biology testing before designing the detailed micro-structures in the compact disk. Some basic element components such as valves, mixing units, and separating units should all be used to complete the full testing process. The most basic principles applied in such micro-fluidic structures are centrifugal force, coriolis effect, and surface tension. The micromachining techniques, including patterning, photolithography, and etching should all be used as long as the design is verified. Once the testing process is successful in the biodisk, the complex detection technique is started. There are many methods proposed by scientists in this area. The most popular method is immunoassay which is widely use in the testing of biology. The final step is receiving data from the biodisk by means of a CD drive and modifying either software or hardware that can achieve this function. A popular method is reading data from the biodisk using a common CD drive with some developed software, which contains the advantage of being low on cost. Once the centrifugal micro-fluidic biochip is developed well enough to be manufactured on a large scale, it will cause a wide effect on the industry as well as medical care, especially in developing countries, where high-precision equipment is not available. People in developed countries who are willing to do such regular home-care detections can also benefit from this new technology. History The centrifugal microfluidic platform, including the chip and the device, has been a focus of academic and industrial research efforts for almost 40 years. Primarily targeting biomedical applications, a range of assays have been adapted on the system. The platform has found success as a research or clinical tool and has been further commercialised recently. Nonetheless, this micro-fluidic lab-on- a-chip technology has experienced a breathtaking surge over the last 10‚Äì15 years, and new developments in centrifugal microfluidic technologies have the potential to establish widespread utilization of the platform. Therefore, different liquid-handling platforms have been developed to implement unit operations such as sample take-up, sample preconditioning, reagent supply, metering, aliquoting, valving, routing, mixing, incubation, washing, as well as analytical or preparative separations. The integration of such sample preparation, incubation, analysis on a self-contained disc in a device that controls the spinning for automatic performance encourages the sample-to- answer diagnosis in the point-of-care biomedical platform. Dr. Marc Madou in UC Irvine is one of the leaders in the centrifugal micro-fluidic biochip. He has done several research projects on this area and has made great success such as pneumatic pumping in centrifugal microfluidic platforms, integration of 3D carbon-electrode dielectrophoresis, and serial siphon valving. His group members are working on projects including cell lysis, PCR card, DNA hybridization, anthrax diagnostics and respiratory virus detection (see external links). Dr. Hua-Zhong Yu in SFU.ca also made great progress in this area, proposing a new digitized molecular diagnostics reading method and a new DNA detection method on plastic CD. (see external links) Dr. Gang Logan Liu in UIUC is currently also focusing on this area (see external links). Structure design The design of structure bases on the principle of microfluidics and typical components are used in the platform. many structures for centrifugal microfluidic biochips have been developed, with more interesting ones yet to be released. Madou's group invented the valve-chamber structure in 2004. In recent years, Saki Kondo released the vertical liquid transportation structure, which pushed the design to become a three-dimensional concept. Madou's group also invented a serial siphon valving structure which makes flow control much easier. Hong Chen created a spiral microchannel which allows parallel testing with more steps. =Principle= The principle for the centrifugal micro-fluidic biochip includes the basic forces of a particle as well as the principle of flow control. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License For a particle in the flow the basic forces are centrifugal force, Coriolis force, Euler force and viscous force. The centrifugal force plays a role as a pump in the fluid flowing. It offers the basic source to transfer the fluid flowing from the inner radius of CD to the outer radius. The magnitude of the centrifugal force is determined by the radius of particle location and the rotational speed. The formula for centrifugal force density is: f_\\\\mathrm=N{\\\\omega}^2r. where N is the mass density of the liquid, œâ the angular frequency and r the (radial) distance between the particle and center of the disk. The formula for Coriolis force density is: f_\\\\mathrm{C}=2N{\\\\omega}u. where u is the flow velocity. The Coriolis force generates when the liquid has a velocity component along the radial direction. This force is generally smaller than the centrifugal force when the rotating speed is not high enough. When it comes to a high angular frequency, the Coriolis force makes a difference to the flow of liquid, which is often used to separate fluid flow in the separation unit. Another basic force is Euler force, which is often defined as the acceleration of angular frequency. For example, when the CD is rotating at a constant speed, the Euler force is relatively slow. The formula for Euler force density is: f_\\\\mathrm{E}=Nr\\\\frac{d{\\\\omega}}{dt}. As for a particle in the fluidic flow, the viscous force is: f_\\\\mathrm{v}=v\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}. v is the viscosity of the liquid. As for the entire fluid flow, surface tension plays an important role in flow control. When the flow comes across a varied cross section, the surface tension will balance the centrifugal force and as a result block the flow of liquid. Higher rotation speed is necessary if the liquid would like to enter the next chamber. In this way, due to surface tension, the flowing process is divided into several steps which makes it simpler to realize flow control. =Typical component= There are various typical units in a centrifugal microfluidic structure, including valves, volume metering, mixing and flow switching. These types of units can make up structures that can be used in a variety of ways. Valves Passive valves solely actuated by centrifugal forces: (a) capillary, (b) hydrophobic, (c) burstable seal, (d) centrifugo-pneumatic overpressure, (e) centrifugo- pneumatic under pressure, (f) remotely vented collection chamber (e.g., by wetting a dissolvable film56), (g) remotely vented inlet chamber (e.g., by a clepsydra structure), (h) capillary siphon, (i) overflow siphon, and (j) pneumatic siphon valve.The principle of valves is the balance between centrifugal force and surface tension. When the centrifugal force is smaller than the surface tension, the liquid flow will be held in the original chamber; when the centrifugal force overbalances the surface tension due to a higher rotating speed, the liquid flow will break the valve and flow into the next chamber. This can be used to control the flow process simply by controlling the rotating speed of the disk. The most commonly used valves include the hydrophilic valve, the hydrophobic valve, the syphon valve and sacrificial valve. As for hydrophilic and hydrophobic valves, the generation of surface tension is almost the same. It is the sudden change of cross section of the channel that generates the surface tension. The liquid flow will be held in a hydrophilic channel when the cross section suddenly becomes large, while the flow will be held when the cross section of hydrophobic channel suddenly shrinks. The siphon valve is simply based upon the siphon phenomenon. When the cross section of the channel is small enough, the liquid in the chamber is able to flow along the channel due to surface tension. Unlike hydrophilic or hydrophobic valves, surface tension acts as a pump in this model while centrifugal force acts as resistance instead. The sacrificial valve is a new technique that is controlled by laser irradiation. These sacrificial valves are composed of iron oxide nanoparticles dispersed in paraffin wax. Upon excitation with a laser diode, iron oxide nanoparticles within the wax act as integrated nanoheaters, causing the wax to quickly melt at relatively low intensities of laser diode excitation. The valve operation is independent of the spin speed or the location of the valves and therefore allows for more complex biological assays integrated on the disk. Volume metering Aliquoting principle.Volume metering is a typical function of centrifugal fluidics to reach a certain amount of liquid reagent. It can be achieved by simply connecting an overflow channel to the chamber. Once the liquid is at the level of the overflow channel, the rest of the liquid will be routed into the waste chamber connected to the overflow channel. Mixing Mixing is an important function in microfluidics, which combines various reagents for downstream analysis. As the fluid is confined in the microscale domain, mixing becomes difficult due to the low Reynolds number with laminar flow. That indicates that there is no convective mixing but diffusion, which limits the mixing process. This problem can be solved using several methods. A typical way is to rotating the disk in different directions, namely clockwise and counter clockwise rotation. Flow switching Flow switching is necessary when routing reagents into different chambers. A common method for flow switching in a centrifugal device is to utilize the Coriolis force within a Y-shaped structure. When the rotating speed is too low, the liquid flow will follow the original path; when the rotating speed is high enough, which is at almost the same level as centrifugal force, the liquid flow will be routed into another chamber. Others Other functions such as sedimentation are also used in microfluidic platforms when necessary. Due to the different mass and radius between different particles, these particles can be separated by viscosity and velocity. In this way, the sedimentation of different particles can be achieved. Materials Many structures can be formed using the most common, rapid prototyping technology, soft lithography with polydimethylsiloxane(PDMS). PDMS is an inexpensive, clear elastomeric polymer with rubbery mechanical properties at room temperature. In the laboratory, PDMS is mixed in small batches, poured onto moulds, for example, poly(methyl methacrylate)(PMMA), with microscale features, and cured at moderate temperatures for minutes to hours. Open PDMS channels are closed by adhering the channel bearing component to a glass slide or a second, flat piece of PDMS. Inlets and outlets can be formed easily using punch tools. Although many surface modifications are not permanent on PDMS due to its relatively high chain mobility compared with polymers, PDMS still remains relevant as a material for microfluidic applications. Thermoplastics are also coming into use. The use of engineering thermoplastics has many advantages, although most of these advantages have not yet been realized. There are a few commodity plastics that have emerged as suitable for medical microfluidic applications. These include poly(methyl methacrylate)(PMMA), polystyrene, polycarbonate, and a variety of cyclic polyolefin materials. PMMA has good optical properties for fluorescence, and UV detection modes are relatively easy to seal to themselves. These are available in grades suitable for both injection and compression molding. Polystyrene is a material known for assay development. Polycarbonates have a high glass transition temperature but poor optical properties for fluorescent detection. The cyclic polyolefins appear to have the best combination of optical and mechanical properties. Detection =Signal sending= Sample preparation Before the molecules react with the reagents, they should be prepared for the reactions. The most typical is separation by centrifugal force. In the case of blood, for example, the sedimentation of blood cells from plasma can be achieved by rotating the biodisk for some time. After separation, all molecular diagnostic assays require a step of cell/viral lysis in order to release genomic and proteomic material for downstream processing. Typical lysis methods include chemical and physical method. The chemical lysis method, which is the simplest way, uses chemical detergents or enzymes to break down membranes. The physical lysis can be achieved by using bead beating system on a disk. Lysis occurs due to collisions and shearing between the beads and the cells and through friction shearing along the lysis chamber walls. ELISA/FIA ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays) and FIA (fluorescent immunoassays) are two methods of immunoassays. Immunoassays are standard tools used in clinical diagnostics. These tests rely on the specific detection of either the antibody or antigen, and are commonly performed by labeling the antibody/antigen of interest through various means such as fluorescent or enzymatic labels. However, washing, mixing, and incubation always take a great deal of time. When integrated in microfluid biodisks, the detection times become extremely short and such types of tests can be widely used in this area. In ELISA method, enzymes are used to produce a detectable signal from an antibody‚Äìantigen complex. At the first step, any antigen present will bind to capture antibodies which have been coated on the channel's surface. Then, detecting antibodies added to bind to the antigen. The enzyme-linked secondary antibody follows the detecting antibodies and binds to them. Finally, when substrate is added, it will be converted by enzyme to a detectable form. Base on this principle, Sergi Morais achieved multiplexed microimmunoassays on a digital versatile disk. This multiplexed assay could achieve detection limits (IC10) of 0.06Œºg/L and sensitivities of (IC50) 0.54Œºg/L.* In addition to typical ELISA assays, fluorescent immunoassays (FIA) are also introduced on a centrifugal microfluidic device. The principle of FIA is almost the same with ELISA; the most significant difference is that fluorescence labels are used instead of enzymes.  Nucleic acid analysis  Nucleic acid sensing using gene-specific nucleic acid amplification with a fluorescence dye or a probe, nucleic acid microarrays, such as DNA microarrays, have become important tools for genetic analysis, gene expression profiling, and genetic-based diagnostics. In the gene-specific nucleic acid amplification, standard PCR or isothermal amplification, such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), is used to amplify the target genetic marker with the DNA-binding fluorescence dye or a sequence-specific probe is applied for signal generation. The fluorescence can be detected in a modified CD/DVD drive or a disc device. In the nucleic acid microarrays, the process of probe immobilization and signal amplification can be separated into five steps. The surface of the microchannel is first irradiated with UV light in the presence of ozone to produce a hydrophilic surface with a high density of carboxylic acid groups (step 1). Then, the probe molecules (biotin, DNA, or human plasma IgG) are covalently attached to the polycarbon surface via amide coupling (step 2). Later, the target molecules are labeled with fluorescent tags and this biotin-labeled target DNA is hybridized with the probe DNA immobilized on the disk (step 3). Subsequently, gold nanoparticles are bonded with the target via streptavidin conjugate (step 4). Silver is then deposited onto the gold ‚Äúseed‚Äù (step 5) to increase the particle size from a few to several hundred nanometers. The amplification of fluorescence will be detected by the detection system in the CD drive. =Signal receiving= The detection system should be completed by the signal receiving component. There are roughly three types of systems which can be used for detecting. The first is Hardware and software modification, which means the CD/DVD drive should be modified and the software should also be developed at the same time. This type will cause superfluous labor and expenses, and may not be versatile in developing countries or indigenous areas. The second type is Software modification with standard hardware, which means that the detection can be achieved by developing customer software on platforms such as C++ without making any changes to hardware. The third is Standard hardware and existing software, which means that the detection can be realized simply by using the existing equipment. Manu Pallapa described a new protocol to read and quantify biotin‚Äìstreptavidin binding assays with a standard optical drive by using a current CD-data analysis software (IsoBuster) successfully. The latter two types are both considerable when coming across different situations. No matter which type of detection system one uses, the reading method is an important factor. There are mainly two reading methods, which are AAS (acquired analog signals) and ERD (error reading detection). In the AAS method, to determine multianalytes on a DVD, the analog signals acquired directly from the photodiode of a CD/DVD drive correlate well with the optical density of the reaction products. The ERD method is based on the analysis of reading errors. It can use the same digital versatile disk and a standard DVD drive without any supplementary hardware. ERD In the ERD method, the position and level of the resulting reading error correspond to the physical location and the intensity of the bioassay signal, respectively. The errors are then compared with a perfectly recorded CD to identify the time when one certain error was read out. There are several free CD-quality diagnostic programs, such as PlexTools Professional, Kprobe, and CD-DVD Speed, which can be used to access the error-statistic information in a CD/DVD drive and to generate a plot displaying the variation of the block error rate as function of playtime. In a typical 700-MB CD-R containing 79.7 minutes of audio data, for example, the radius that error occurs can be calculated from the following equation: r=\\\\sqrt{{t \\\\over 79.7} (58^2-25^2)+ 25^2} t is the reading time and r is the radius location. AAS In the AAS method, the set of servo systems (focus, tracking, sled, and spindle servos) keeps the laser beam focused on the spiral track, and allows disc rotation and laser head motion during the scanning. The amplification/detection board (DAB) is integrated into the CD/DVD drive unit and incorporates a photosensor and electronic circuitry to amplify the RF signal extracted from the photodiode transducer. The photosensor generates a trigger signal when detecting the trigger mark. Both signals are brought to the USB2.0 data acquisition board(DAQ) for digitization and quantification.

The drainage of of land around Tattershall was authorised in 1796, and came under the control of the Witham Third District commissioners in 1844 The building dates to 1856 when a rotative beam engine was built to replace windmill style engines possibly dating to 1540 and draining land between the rivers Bain and Witham. The engine discharged into the River Witham, but has a long fetch from a drain parallel to the river called The Dogdyke engine drain originating just south of Kirkstead at a place called Parkbeck. 1856 is relatively late and Wheeler does say that the 1856 engine replaces one installed in 1841, but the location of that is unknown. The building is a grade II listed ancient monument. Engines * Bradley and Craven Beam engine and scoop wheel, built 1856 * Ruston & Hornsby Diesel engine and centrifugal pump, built 1940 * Ruston & Hornsby auxiliary engine. =Steam engine= The engine frame and flywheel The Scoop wheel The steam engine is maintained by a preservation trust, and steamed on weekends throughout the summer. Although the Pinchbeck Engine is older, it can no longer be steamed. The preservation trust claim this is the oldest working steam drainage engine. The engine built by Bradley & Craven Ltd of Wakefield has a flywheel, and a cylinder of diameter and stroke. The construction is similar to an 'A' frame, but the decorative form of the cast iron upright obscures that basic shape and might be considered unique. The scoop wheel is in diameter and runs at up to 7rpm through a 4:1 gearbox from the engine. The first boiler, which lasted until 1909, was a twin tube Cornish type, working at 12psi. The replacement was a Lancashire boiler made by Fosters of Lincoln, delivering 15psi. Although the structure of this boiler survives, its rear end has been removed to make room for a modern vertical boiler which is used for the demonstration steamings. The original Chimney was struck by lightning in 1922 and reduced somewhat. It was felled in 1941 after the conversion to diesel operation. =Diesel engines= The Ruston engine The two diesel engines are maintained by The Witham Third District Internal Drainage Board as a standby for the nearby electric pumping station. They are usually operated when the museum is open. The steam engine was replaced in 1940 by a Ruston & Hornsby 7XHR diesel engine, serial number 194833, driving a 22 inch Gwynnes centrifugal pump. This engine has a capacity of 23.6 litre. The 7XHR design has a single horizontal cylinder of bore, stroke, and develops at 300rpm. There is also a Ruston & Hornsby 1VTO auxiliary engine, used to provide the starting air for the larger engine and to operate a small priming pump for the Gwynnes Limited pump. The 1VTO design has a single horizontal cylinder of bore, stroke, and develops at 1000rpm. Public access Access to the site on steaming days involves driving down an unmade road and walking across a grassed area. Although essentially on one level, disabled access is limited because of the historic nature of the site. Toilets, teas and limited wheelchair access are offered.

In 2007, Ventrone transferred to Villanova University, his brother Ray's alma mater, where he earned a football scholarship. He played in all 11 games in 2007, finishing third on the team with 64 tackles while also recording five pass break-ups and one interception. As a junior in 2008, Ventrone led the team with four interceptions, along with 61 tackles and a fumble recovery in 13 games played. Ventrone was part of the Wildcats' NCAA Division I FCS Championship in 2009. He recorded 73 tackles including 53 solo stops, as well as 6.5 tackles for loss and three sacks. Professional career =New England Patriots= 2010 season After going undrafted in the 2010 NFL Draft, Ventrone was signed by the New England Patriots on April 29, 2010. He played in the team's preseason opener against the New Orleans Saints before being waived on August 15. He was re-signed on August 23, and played in the team's final two preseason games before being waived during final cuts on September 4. He was signed to the Patriots' practice squad on October 19, 2010.

Markwart, Wehrot und Arang, ed. H. H. Schaeder, Leiden, 1938, pp. 133ff.) One of the old, thorny problems in studies on Avestan geography is represented by Airyana Vaƒì«∞ah (Pahlavi: ƒírƒÅnwƒìz), \\"the area of the Aryans\\" and first of the sixteen districts in Vd. 1, the original name of which was airyan…ôm vaƒì«∞≈ç va≈ãhuyƒÅ dƒÅityayƒÅ, \\"the Aryan extension of Va≈ãuhƒ´ DƒÅityƒÅ\\", where Va≈ãuhƒ´ DƒÅityƒÅ \\"the good DƒÅityƒÅ\\" is the name of a river connected with the religious \\"law\\" (dƒÅta-). The concept of Airyana Vaƒì«∞ah is not equivalent to that of airy≈ç.≈°ayana- in Yt. 10.13, or to the group of airyƒÅ dai≈ãÃÅhƒÅvƒÅ \\"the Aryan lands\\" which is recurrent in the yashts; this, in fact, refers to just one of the Aryan lands, as the first chapter of the VidƒìvdƒÅd clearly shows. It does not designate \\"the traditional homeland\\" or \\"the ancient homeland\\" of the Iranians. These definitions perpetuate old interpretations of the Airyana Vaƒì«∞ah as \\"Urheimat des Awestavolkes\\", \\"Urland\\" of the Indo-Iranians (F. Spiegel, Die arische Periode und ihre Zust√§nde, Leipzig, 1887, p. 123), \\"Wiege aller iranischen Arier\\" (J. von Pr√°≈°ek, Geschichte der Meder und Perser bis zur makedonischen Eroberung I, Gotha, 1906, p. 29), drawing from the texts more than the contents really warrant. Airyana Vaƒì«∞ah is only the homeland of Zoroaster and of Zoroastrianism. According to Zoroastrian tradition ƒírƒÅnwƒìz is situated at the center of the world; on the shores of its river, Weh DƒÅitƒ´ (Av. Va≈ãuhƒ´ DƒÅityƒÅ), there were created the gƒÅw ƒ´ ƒìw-dƒÅd (Av. gav aƒìv≈ç.dƒÅta) \\"uniquely created bull\\" and Gay≈çmard (Av. Gay≈ç.mar…ôtan) \\"mortal life,\\" the first man; there rises the ChagƒÅd ƒ´ DƒÅidƒ´g, the \\"lawful Summit,\\" the Peak of HarƒÅ, in Avestan also called \\"of good activity\\"; the Chinvat Bridge is there, and there too, Yima and Zoroaster became famous. Taken all together, these data show that Zoroastrianism superimposed the concept of Airyana Vaƒì«∞ah onto the traditional one of a center of the world where the Peak of HarƒÅ rises. The fact that Airyana Vaƒì«∞ah is situated in a mountainous region explains its severe climate (Vd. 1.2.3) better than does its supposed location in Chorasmia (Markwart, ƒírƒÅnshahr, p. 155). This is not surprising if we consider the analogy between the Iranian concept of the peak of HarƒÅ with the Indian one of Mount Meru or Sumeru. The Manicheans identified AryƒÅn-wai≈æan with the region at the foot of Mount Sumeru that WishtƒÅsp reigned over, and the Khotanese texts record the identification of Mount Sumeru in Buddhist mythology with the Peak of HarƒÅ (ttaira harays√§) in the Avestan tradition. All this leads us to suppose that the concept of Airyana Vaƒì«∞ah was an invention of Zoroastrianism which gave a new guise to a traditional idea of Indo-Iranian cosmography. Yasht references There is further geographical interest to be found in another passage from the Avesta Yasht 10.13‚Äì14, where the whole region inhabited by the Aryans (airy≈ç.≈°ayana-) is described. The description begins with Mount HarƒÅ, the peak of which is reached by Mithra as he precedes the immortal sun and looked at the Aryan homeland. Like the Mihr Yasht, the Farvardƒ´n Yasht also contains some passages of use in the reconstruction of Avestan geography, in particular Yt. 13.125 and Yt. 13.127, where some characters are mentioned because of their venerable fravashi.it should be born in mind that the character related to the land of Apaxshƒ´rƒÅ, Parsha·π±.gav, may be connected with a Sƒ´stƒÅni tradition and that the passage in Yt. 13.125 is dedicated to the fravashi of members of the family of Saƒìna, the son of Ah≈´m.st≈´·π±, who also had connections with Sƒ´stƒÅn. The ZamyƒÅd Yasht, dedicated to X·µõar…ônah, is of very great importance for Avestan geography as it provides a surprisingly well- detailed description of the hydrography of the Helmand region, in particular of HƒÅm≈´n-e Helmand. In Yt. 19.66‚Äì77 nine rivers an mentioned: X·µõƒÅstrƒÅ, HvaspƒÅ, FradaŒ∏ƒÅ, X·µõar…ônahvaitƒ´, U≈°tavaitƒ´, UrvaŒ¥ƒÅ, ∆ér…ôzƒ´, Zur…ônumaitƒ´, and Haƒìtumant; six of these are known from the TƒÅrƒ´kh-e Sƒ´stƒÅn. Other features of Sƒ´stƒÅni geography recur in the same yasht, like the KƒÖsaoya lake (Pahlavi KayƒÅnsih) or Mount U≈°i.‚ÄôƒÅm (K≈´h-e Kh·µõƒÅ«∞a), both closely bound up with Zoroastrian eschatology, so that with the help of comparisons with Pahlavi and classical sources, mainly Pliny and Ptolemy, we can conclude that the ZamyƒÅd Yasht describes Sƒ´stƒÅn with great care and attention. In Avestan geography no other region has received such treatment. There is an echo of Sƒ´stƒÅn‚Äôs importance in Avestan geography in the brief Pahlavi treatise Abdƒ´h ud sahƒ´gƒ´h ƒ´ SagastƒÅn. Yet another reference to Sƒ´stƒÅn is to be found it another passage of the great yashts, Yt. 5.108, in which Kavi Vƒ´≈°tƒÅspa, prince and patron of Zoroaster, is represented in the act of making sacrifice to Ar…ôdvƒ´ S≈´rƒÅ AnƒÅhitƒÅ near FrazdƒÅnu, the FrazdƒÅn of Pahlavi literature, that is, one of the wonders of Sƒ´stƒÅn; it can probably be identified with Gowd-e Zera. Conclusion If we compare the first chapter of the VidƒìvdƒÅd with the passages of geographical interest that we come across mainly in the great yashts, we can conclude that the geographical area of Avesta was dominated by the Hindu Kush range at the northeast, the western boundary being marked by the districts of Rey, possibly gilan = Var…ôna and Alborz mountains. The Margiana, Hyrcania, Areia, and Drangiana in central, the eastern one by the Indo-Iranian frontier regions such as GandhƒÅra, Bunƒìr, the land of the ‚ÄúSeven Rivers.‚Äù Sogdiana and, possibly, Chorasmia (which, however, is at the extreme limits) mark the boundary to the north, Sƒ´stƒÅn and Baluchistan to the south.

More significantly, Willard sent letters to the Puritan minister Cotton Mather who published an account of Elizabeth Knapp's possession in his Magnalia Christi Americana. Knapp, who was sixteen at the time was the daughter of a farmer and the servant in the house of Willard. Her possession, which has striking resemblance to those that are seen in Salem some twenty years later,Elaine G. Breslaw, Witches of the Atlantic World: A Historical Reader and Primary Sourcebook (New York: New York University Press, 2000), 230. serves as an insight into Puritan life and society. Life in Groton Groton, Massachusetts is located 32 miles NW of Boston. During the time of Elizabeth Knapp's possession it was located in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. In 1676, just four years after the Knapp case, the town was attacked by 400 Native Americans, and all but a few of the homes were destroyed in the attack.\\"Groton, Mass,\\" NewEnglandTowns.org, accessed November 6, 2010.

America: History & Life, EBSCOhost (accessed November 7, 2010) The possession The possession case of Elizabeth Knapp is unique and strange in the aspect that it was documented and approached from a thoughtful, and scientific aspect. Knapp was the servant at the household of Samuel Willard, a prominent Reverend in the church of Groton. This became an issue because Willard was known for his sermons about damnation and obedience to God. One Sermon in particular states that the youth of the town should have been very careful because, \\"although God is ready to receive them, the Devil is ready to endeavor them\\".Elisabeth Ceppi, \\"Invisible Labor: Puritan Servitude and the Demonic Possession of Elizabeth Knapp.\\" America: History and Life, EBSCOhost accessed November 6, 2010,(2006):263. When Knapp, a member of his own household, began to show signs of a demonic possession, Willard took a careful and scientific approach to the situation, which was rare for 17th century Puritan New England.Elaine G. Breslaw, Witches of the Atlantic World: A Historical Reader and Primary Sourcebook (New York: New York University Press,2000), 362. He called in a medical doctor on several occasions and tried to find a cure for her symptoms. After they could provide no explanation for her fits he declared that it was a case of possession. Throughout the entire process, as noted in his journal, Knapp seemed to have the most violent fits when he was present. Willard carefully and meticulously documented Knapp daily from the night she first showed signs, Monday October 30, 1671 until January 12, 1672. Willard states that Knapp, at first, began to complain of pains throughout her body. She would grab certain body parts, such as her leg, breast, and neck and yell out, particularly about strangulation. She would go through emotional fits, sometimes laughing to the point of hysterics, weeping, or screaming out. Hallucinations then followed. On several occasions she claimed to see 'two persons' walking around her. Also she stated to have seen a man floating around her bed. Knapp also broke out into fits, particularly at night time, and convulse on the ground. Then she tried to throw herself into the fire. Willard notes that on the first Sabbath day after the symptoms appeared the young girl became violent, leaping, and contorting her body to the point where it took three to four people to hold her down. As she was throwing these fits, she would yell out the words: \\"money, money, sin and misery, misery!\\"Samuel Willard. \\"A Brief Account of a Strange and Unusual providence of God Befallen to Elizabeth Knapp of Groton (1671‚Äì1672),\\" in Witches of the Atlantic World: A Historical Reader and Primary Sourcebook, ed. Elaine G. Breslaw (New York University Press, 2000), 236. Willard then documented that on the night of November 2, 1671 Knapp made a confession of meeting with the devil, a characteristic of most possession cases. She stated that for three years the devil met with her promising her money, youth, ease from labor, and the ability to see the world. She then claimed that he had presented her with a book of blood covenants which were signed by other women as well. She also said the Devil had tried to get her to kill herself and others, Willard and his family included, but she could not do what he asked. She continued with fits and apparitions of the Devil and various other spirits until the night of November 28, in which she had a fit lasting for 48 hours. Afterwards she was in a catatonic state until the night of December 8, in which she made the confession that after being assaulted by the devil various times, she made the pact with him, and allowed him into her bed. Willard's Journal continued on to state that she, throughout the month of December goes in and out of violent fits, one much worse than the next, she talks in a strange, deep voice, and made animal sounds. It is also this during these few weeks that Willard states the Devil, \\"talked through her body\\", calling him a rogue minister.Samuel Willard. \\"A Brief Account of a Strange and Unusual providence of God Befallen to Elizabeth Knapp of Groton (1671-1672),\\" in Witches of the Atlantic World: A Historical Reader and Primary Sourcebook, ed. Elaine G. Breslaw (New York University Press, 2000), 239-241. Willards entries do not begin again until January 10, 1672 where he writes that he met with Knapp again. She confessed to him that the Devil had control of her body and that he was much more powerful than she was. She stated that he also took hold of her speech and she had no control of the things that she was saying. The next night she went into a fit of hysterical crying and weeping in which she called for Willard's presence. The fits \\"held her till late in the night...as long as [Willard] tarried, which was more than an hour. I left her in them. And thus she continues speechless to this instant January 15.\\" Samuel Willard. \\"A Brief Account of a Strange and Unusual providence of God Befallen to Elizabeth Knapp of Groton (1671-1672),\\" in Witches of the Atlantic World: A Historical Reader and Primary Sourcebook, ed. Elaine G. Breslaw (New York University Press, 2000), 244. After this night Willard ends his documentation of the possession case stating that he will leave it to those who are \\"more learned, aged, and judicious\\" than he was. Willard concluded his entries with a final four points in which he gave his final opinions about the validity of the possession case. In the first point he stated that Knapp's distemper in no way can be counterfeit on the grounds that it was physically impossible to fake such actions. The second point refers to whether or not her temper was natural or diabolical, in which he stated, because of the length of her convulsions and the strength of her fits, he believed them to be diabolical. In the third point he concluded that even though many were skeptical of the fact that the devil talked through the girl, he was convinced. He stated on several occasions she spoke with her mouth closed, her throat would swell up like a balloon, and the voices that he heard were not her own. However, in the fourth point he said he has strong doubts about Knapp making a pact with the Devil. This is because she is so contradictory about the facts, and what happened in her supposed meetings with the Devil.Samuel Willard. \\"A Brief Account of a Strange and Unusual providence of God Befallen to Elizabeth Knapp of Groton (1671-1672),\\" in Witches of the Atlantic World: A Historical Reader and Primary Sourcebook, ed. Elaine G. Breslaw (New York University Press, 2000), 244‚Äì245. Willard went on to give several powerful sermons in the village of Salem during the Salem Witch Trials in 1692, as well as discredited evidence of conviction for several women during the trials, stating that the trials should be held in a \\"fair and legal way\\".Stephen L. Robins \\"Samuel Willard and the Spectres of God's Wrathful Lion.\\" New England Quarterly 60, no. 4 (December 1987): 596‚Äì603. America: History & Life, EBSCOhost (accessed November 7, 2010). After Willard stopped entries into his journal it has been a historical mystery what happened to Knapp.Elaine G. Breslaw, Witches of the Atlantic World: A Historical Reader and Primary Sourcebook. New York University Press p. 245. However her case has been cited and used as examples by various historians. Possible explanations In the study of Witchcraft in history there has been many psychological theories that have arisen as to why so many possession cases took place during the 17th and 18th centuries. One theory is the strict religious atmosphere at the time. It is apparent that most possession cases took place in areas in which religion was the predominant aspect of the society. This could be responsible in the aspect that Knapp felt confined in her community and was frustrated with her situations. She acted out, both mentally and physically, in the only way that she knew, which was through religion. By saying and acting as if she was possessed by the Devil she was rebelling against the institution which was restricting her.Bernard Rosenthal, \\"Witchcraft, Magic, and Religion in Seventeenth-Century Massachusetts.\\" New England Quarterly 57, no. 4 (December 1984): 598-602. America: History & Life, EBSCOhost (accessed November 7, 2010). For example, when Knapp stated that the Devil tried to bribe her on several occasions with fine silks and an ease of labor, her giving in would have been her breaking down her Christian loyalties.John Demos, ‚ÄúUnderlying Themes in the Witchcraft of Seventeenth-Century New England,‚Äù in Witches of the Atlantic World: A Historical Reader and Primary Sourcebook, ed. Elaine G. Breslaw (New York University Press, 2000), 484. A second explanation of could be in regards to the dissatisfaction that Elizabeth Knapp felt about her placement in society. Once she began showing her symptoms she no longer was required to do her work as a servant. Servants, in Puritan New England were treated harshly, especially women who were expected to do most of the manual labor. They had to care for the entire house and the children. She used the possession as an excuse to speak out against all those who held authority over her, for example Willard, her master and Reverend, and her father. The possession, in a sense, moved her up a place in society. Knapp was no longer a sixteen-year-old girl, but an important person who was known throughout the town. No longer considered just a child Knapp now had a place in the Puritan society which did not involve being someone's servant.Elisabeth Ceppi, \\"Invisible Labor: Puritan Servitude and the Demonic Possession of Elizabeth Knapp.\\" America: History and Life, EBSCOhost accessed November 6, 2010,(2006):263-89.

He participated in the southern conquests and held Thessaly with the rank of caesar (kesar) in 1348‚Äì56. His son Thomas Preljuboviƒá was Despot of Epirus in 1366‚Äì84. Biography Preljub appears in sources in 1344, taking part in the Serbian conquest of Macedonia during the Byzantine civil war of 1341‚Äì1347. According to contemporary chroniclers, Stefan Du≈°an considered him the best of all his magnates \\"in valor, courage and experience\\". In May 1344, he led a Serbian army in the Battle of Stephaniana against the Emirate of Aydin, allies of the Byzantine emperor John VI Kantakouzenos. The battle was a defeat, but it did not seriously affect the progress of the Serbian conquest.; In 1348, reinforced with large numbers of Albanians, Preljub invaded Thessaly. Aided by the depopulation brought about by the Black Death, which, among others, had killed the local Byzantine governor, John Angelos, he wrested most of the region from the Byzantines and the Catalans of the Duchy of Neopatria by November of the same year. Du≈°an named him governor of Thessaly, with Trikala as his seat, and gave him the title of caesar as a reward.; Several earlier scholars have stated that Preljub also controlled parts of Epirus, including the city of Ioannina, but recent research regards this as unlikely, and most likely the result of additions or mistakes in later sources. In 1350, John VI Kantakouzenos took advantage of Du≈°an's absence in a campaign against Bosnia, and attempted to recover his lost provinces in Macedonia and Thessaly. He landed at Thessalonica and succeeded in regaining several key fortresses in Macedonia, but his advance towards Thessaly was stopped by Preljub, who, with 500 men, held the strategically important fortress of Servia against him. Kantakouzenos, whose army was rather small, withdrew, and Du≈°an was able to recover his lost fortresses with ease.; Preljub died in late 1355, or early 1356, shortly after Du≈°an himself, in a clash with local Albanian clans.; His widow, Irene Asanina, a daughter of Dushan, and their son Thomas, soon faced an invasion by Nikephoros Orsini, the former Despot of Epirus. Orsini managed to rally the Greek inhabitants of the province to his side, forcing Irene to return to Serbia. In 1357, she married Radoslav Hlapen, the governor of much of western Macedonia, including Vodena and Berrhoea.; In 1366/67, Thomas became ruler of the Despotate of Epirus at Ioannina.

The non-solvable ones were classified by Thompson during his work on finding all the minimal finite simple groups. Simple N-groups The simple N-groups were classified by in a series of 6 papers totaling about 400 pages. The simple N-groups consist of the special linear groups PSL2(q),PSL3(3), the Suzuki groups Sz(22n+1), the unitary group U3(3), the alternating group A7, the Mathieu group M11, and the Tits group. (The Tits group was overlooked in Thomson's original announcement in 1968, but Hearn pointed out that it was also a simple N-group.) More generally Thompson showed that any non-solvable N-group is a subgroup of Aut(G) containing G for some simple N-group G. generalized Thompson's theorem to the case of groups where all 2-local subgroups are solvable. The only extra simple groups that appear are the unitary groups U3(q). Proof gives a summary of Thompson's classification of N-groups. The primes dividing the order of the group are divided into four classes œÄ1, œÄ2, œÄ3, œÄ4 as follows *œÄ1 is the set of primes p such that a Sylow p-subgroup is nontrivial and cyclic. *œÄ2 is the set of primes p such that a Sylow p-subgroup P is non-cyclic but SCN3(P) is empty *œÄ3 is the set of primes p such that a Sylow p-subgroup P has SCN3(P) nonempty and normalizes a nontrivial abelian subgroup of order prime to p. *œÄ4 is the set of primes p such that a Sylow p-subgroup P has SCN3(P) nonempty but does not normalize a nontrivial abelian subgroup of order prime to p. The proof is subdivided into several cases depending on which of these four classes the prime 2 belongs to, and also on an integer e, which is the largest integer for which there is an elementary abelian subgroup of rank e normalized by a nontrivial 2-subgroup intersecting it trivially. * Gives a general introduction, stating the main theorem and proving many preliminary lemmas. * characterizes the groups E2(3) and S4(3) (in Thompson's notation; these are the exceptional group G2(3) and the symplectic group Sp4(3)) which are not N-groups but whose characterizations are needed in the proof of the main theorem. * covers the case where 2‚àâœÄ4.

Also, the treaty required Korea to consult with Japan before making treaties with foreign powers, and before granting concessions or making contracts with foreigners. The treaty presumes that the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of His Majesty the Emperor of Japan and the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs ad interim of His Majesty the Emperor of Korea were respectively authorized and empowered to negotiate and to agree upon the specific language of the proposed bilateral treaty:Scott, * Article I. The Korean Government shall engage as financial adviser to the Korean Government a Japanese subject recommended by the Japanese Government, and all matters concerning finance shall be dealt with after his counsel has been taken. * Article II. The Korean Government shall engage as a diplomatic adviser to the Department of Foreign Affairs a foreigner recommended by the Japanese Government, and all important matters concerning foreign relations shall be dealt with after his counsel has been taken. * Article III. The Korean Government shall consult the Japanese Government previous to concluding Treaties or Conventions with foreign Powers, and in dealing with other important diplomatic affairs such as granting of concessions to or contracts with foreigners. :::-- Hayashi Gonsuke, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary (dated: the 22nd day of the 8th month of the 37th year of Meiji) :::-- Yun Chi-ho, Acting Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (dated: the 22nd day of the 8th month of the 8th year of Gwangmu) An amplified explanation of the scope and purpose of Article III was mentioned in a 1904 letter from the Japanese Ambassador to the United States Takahira Kogor≈ç to the American Secretary of State John Hay: :\\"Article III is not intended to place an impediment in the way of the legitimate enterprise of foreigners in the sphere of commerce and industry, but is calculated to serve as a precaution against the conclusion of improvident and dangerous engagements which have often in the past proved a source of serious complications, as was conspicuously shown in the case of the Russian lease of Yongampho.\\"Scott, Recision Gojong's analysis of the \\"treaty of 1905\\" - just one of many efforts to invalidate the consequences of a coercive process. This \\"alleged treaty\\" was contrived in a coercive process; and Koreans sought to invalidate the unwanted consequences by presenting evidence to the international community. For example, * 1905: Emperor Gojong of the Korean Empire wrote personally to the heads of state in those countries having treaties with Korea; and the Korean government filed formal appeals and sent formal cable notices,Korean Mission ; excerpt, \\"The foregoing are in addition to the appeal of the Emperor of Korea, filed in the State Department on November 25, 1905, and his cable notice of the illegality of the claimed protectorate, filed in the State Department on November 26, 1905.\\" but these diplomatic gestures were unavailing. * 1907: In what is sometimes called the \\"Hague Secret Emissary Affair,\\" Korean emissaries sought unsuccessfully to seek international assistance at the Hague Convention of 1907 at The Hague, Netherlands in 1907.Eckert, Carter J. et al. (1990). Korea Old and New: A History, p. 245. * 1921: Korean representatives attempted to gain a hearing at the Washington Naval Conference of 1921;Korean Mission but the effort was ineffective. This treaty was confirmed to be \\"already null and void\\" by Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea concluded in 1965. \\"It is confirmed that all treaties or agreements concluded between the Empire of Japan and the Empire of Korea on or before August 22, 1910 are already null and void.\\" In 2010, Japan argued that the chronological point of reference for \\"already null and void\\" was August 15, 1948, when the government of the Republic of Korea was established. This point of view is disputed by the Korean analysis, which construes the 1965 treaty as acknowledgment of the nullification of all Japanese-Korean treaties and agreements from 1904 onwards.Lee Man-yeol. \\"For a view of history that puts us at the center,\\" Northeast Asian History Foundation News. 2010.

During the early part of the 20th century parts of the estate were sold off to create a reservoir and a series of local small holdings. The manor house was constructed in the 17th century at least, standing about half a mile to the west of the parish church, north of Park Road. The last house to stand on the site is believed to have been built in the early part of the 19th century by the Sir John Gibbons, 2nd Baronet, who owned the manorial rights from 1754 to 1933. The house had two storeys and was cement rendered with a low-pitched roof behind a parapet. The later west wing was built of red brick, and some of the outbuildings were older than the main house. The surrounding park land was laid out in the 18th century. The bend at the entrance gates in Park Road is probably due to Sir John Gibbons diverting the road in 1760. After Gibbons had enclosed Borough Field in 1771, the Park extended from Oaks Road in the east to Borough Green to the north and was over . The size of the park went down over the years, however.

Gibson moved to Stanwell whilst building the Queen Mary Reservoir at Littleton (then the largest water storage reservoir in the world). He lived at Stanwell Lodge before his purchase of Stanwell Place (90 acres), and the adjoining Stanhope farm (261 acres, including Hammonds farm). In 1936 the Metropolitan Water Board bought most of Gibson's estate, in a contract encompassing 346 acres. It used this land in 1947 to develop the King George VI Reservoir. During the Second World War, Gibson, as deputy director-general civil engineering (special) at the Ministry of Supply (1943‚Äì44), was one of the principal people responsible for the construction of the top secret Mulberry Harbours. It was as a result of this that he lent Stanwell Place to the SHAEF Commanders, and they held two top level meetings there during the buildup to D-Day and the Normandy Invasion. The highest level US commanders, including Henry L. Stimson, General George C. Marshall, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Admiral Ernest J. King, and General of the Air Force Henry H. Arnold, stayed at Stanwell Place for these meetings.

After the assassination of King Faisal in 1958, the house and its grounds was purchased for gravel extraction. Despite local attempts to prevent it, the house was allowed to become derelict and was eventually demolished.

It is a solid, known only as a thermally unstable, insoluble white powder.  Nomenclature  The systematic name cadmium dihydride, a valid IUPAC name, is constructed according to the compositional nomenclature. Cadmium dihydride is also used to refer to the related molecular compound dihydridocadmium and its oligomers. Care should be taken to avoid confusing the two compounds. Cadmium hydride is also used as a compositional IUPAC name for the compound with the chemical formula CdH.  History  In 1950 a research group led by Glenn D. Barbaras, synthesized cadmium hydride for the first time. This reaction sequence consisted of demethylation of dimethylcadmium in diethyl ether at ‚àí78 ¬∞C, to cadmium hydride.  Chemical properties  Solid cadmium hydride, on the basis of its infrared spectrum, is believed to contain hydrogen-bridge bonds. Other lower metal hydrides polymerize in a similar fashion. Unless cooled below , cadmium hydride rapidly decomposes to produce cadmium and hydrogen: : ‚Üí n Cd + n  Dihydridocadmium  Dihydridocadmium is the monomeric, molecular form with the chemical formula (also written ). It is a colorless gas that does not persist undiluted. It was produced by the gas phase reaction of excited cadmium atoms with dihydrogen, H2, and the structure determined high- resolution infrared emission spectra. The molecule is linear, with a bond length of 168.3 pm. = Chemical properties = The two-coordinate hydridocadmium group (-CdH) in hydridocadmiums such as dihydridocadmium can accept an electron-pair donating ligand into the molecule by adduction: :] + L ‚Üí Because of this acceptance of the electron-pair donating ligand (L), dihydridocadmium has Lewis-acidic character. Dihydridocadmium can accept two electron-pairs from ligands, as in the case of the tetrahydridocadmate(2‚àí) anion (). The compound, Cs3CdH5, prepared by the reaction of caesium hydride, CsH, and cadmium metal powder at high temperature contains the ion, along with caesium cations, Cs+, and hydride anions, H‚àí. The tetrahedral anion is an example of an ionic complex of CdH2. The average Cd-H bond length in is 182pm. In gaseous dihydridocadmium, the molecules form groups (trimers), being connected by van der Waals forces. The dissociation enthalpy of the dimer is estimated at 8.8 kJ mol‚àí1.

Japanese game development is often identified with the golden age of video games, including Nintendo under Shigeru Miyamoto and Hiroshi Yamauchi, Sega during the same time period, Sony Computer Entertainment when it was based in Tokyo, and other companies such as Taito, Namco, Capcom, Square Enix, Konami, NEC, and SNK, among others. The space is known for the catalogs of several major publishers, all of whom have competed in the video game console and video arcade markets at various points. Sega - Service Games, founded by American veterans in Japan after World War II - released Periscope in 1966, a major arcade hit in Japan, preceding several decades of success in the arcade industry there. Nintendo, a former hanafuda playing card vendor, rose to prominence during the 1980s with the release of the home video game console called the Famicom or \\"Family Computer\\", which became a major hit as the Nintendo Entertainment System or \\"NES\\" in the United States. Sony, already one of the world's largest electronics manufacturers, entered the market in 1994 with the Sony PlayStation, one of the first home consoles to feature 3d graphics, almost immediately establishing itself as a major publisher in the space. Shigeru Miyamoto remains internationally renowned as a \\"father of videogaming\\" and is the only game developer so far to receive Japan's highest civilian honor for artists, the ÊñáÂåñÂäüÂä¥ËÄÖ bunka k≈çr≈çsha or Person of Cultural Merit. Arcade culture is a major influence among young Japanese, with Akihabara Electric Town being a major nexus of so-called otaku culture in Japan, which overlaps with videogaming heavily. The Japanese role- playing game is a major game genre innovated by Japan and remains popular both domestically and internationally, with titles like Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest selling millions. The country has an estimated 67.6 million players in 2018. History =Background= In 1966, Sega introduced an electro- mechanical game called Periscope \\\\- a submarine simulatorBrian Ashcraft (2008) Arcade Mania!

Wolf (2008), The video game explosion: a history from PONG to PlayStation and beyond, p. 149, ABC-CLIO, Sega later produced gun games that used rear image projection in a manner similar to the ancient zoetrope to produce moving animations on a screen. The first of these, the light-gun game Duck Hunt, appeared in 1969; it featured animated moving targets on a screen, printed out the player's score on a ticket, and had volume-controllable sound-effects. Another Sega 1969 release, Missile, a shooter, featured electronic sound and a moving film strip to represent the targets on a projection screen. =1970s-early 1980s= Use of color graphics and individualized antagonists were considered \\"strong evolutionary concepts\\" among space ship games. The Namco Galaxian arcade system board also introduced multi-colored animated sprites. That same year saw the release of SNK's debut shoot 'em up Ozma Wars, notable for being the first action game to feature a supply of energy, resembling a life bar, a mechanic that has now become common in the majority of modern action games.Playing With Power: Great Ideas That Have Changed Gaming Forever, 1UP It also featured vertically scrolling backgrounds and enemies. Epoch's TV Tennis Electrotennis, Japan's first home video game console. The Color TV-Game Block Kuzushi. Japan's first home video game console was Epoch's TV Tennis Electrotennis, a licensed version of the ping-pong game from the Magnavox Odyssey. It was followed by the first successful Japanese console, Nintendo's Color TV Game, in 1977. Sega's black and white boxing game Heavyweight Champ was released in 1976 as the first video game to feature fist fighting. The first stealth games were Hiroshi Suzuki's Manbiki Shounen (1979) and Manbiki Shoujo (1980), Taito's Lupin III (1980), and Sega's 005 (1981).005, Arcade History Tomohiro Nishikado, creator of the shooter game Space Invaders. Eventually, the 1978 arcade release of Space Invaders would mark the first major mainstream breakthrough for video games in Japan.Martin Picard, The Foundation of Geemu: A Brief History of Early Japanese video games, International Journal of Computer Game Research, 2013 Created by Nishikado at Japan's Taito Corporation, Space Invaders pitted the player against multiple enemies descending from the top of the screen at a constantly increasing rate of speed.Buchanan, Levi, Space Invaders , IGN, March 31, 2003. Accessed June 14, 2008 Space Invaders pitted the player against multiple enemies descending from the top of the screen at a constantly increasing rate of speed. The game used alien creatures inspired by The War of the Worlds (by H. G. Wells) because the developers were unable to render the movement of aircraft; in turn, the aliens replaced human enemies because of moral concerns (regarding the portrayal of killing humans) on the part of Taito Corporation. As with subsequent shoot 'em ups of the time, the game was set in space as the available technology only permitted a black background. The game also introduced the idea of giving the player a number of \\"lives\\". It popularised a more interactive style of gameplay with the enemies responding to the player- controlled cannon's movement, and it was the first video game to popularise the concept of achieving a high score, being the first to save the player's score. The aliens of Space Invaders return fire at the protagonist, making them the first arcade game targets to do so. It set the template for the shoot 'em up genre, and has influenced most shooting games released since then. Donkey Kong arcade cabinet Taito's Space Invaders, in 1978, proved to be the first blockbuster arcade video game. Its success marked the beginning of the golden age of arcade video games. Video game arcades sprang up in shopping malls, and small \\"corner arcades\\" appeared in restaurants, grocery stores, bars and movie theaters all over Japan and other countries during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Space Invaders (1978), Galaxian (1979), Pac-Man (1980) and Bosconian (1981) were especially popular. By 1981, the arcade video game industry was worth $8 billion ($ in ). Some games of this era were so popular that they entered popular culture. The first to do so was Space Invaders. The game was so popular upon its release in 1978 that an urban legend blamed it for a national shortage of 100 yen coins in Japan, leading to a production increase of coins to meet demand for the game (although 100 yen coin production was lower in 1978 and 1979 than in previous or subsequent years, and the claim does not withstand logical scrutiny: arcade operators would have emptied out their machines and taken the money to the bank, thus keeping the coins in circulation). Japanese arcade games during the golden age also had hardware unit sales at least in the tens of thousands, including Ms. Pac-Man with over 115,000 units, Donkey Kong with over 60,000, Galaxian with 40,000, Donkey Kong Jr. with 35,000, Mr. Do! with 30,000, =1980s-early 2000s= Japanese-English term Famicom) From 1980 to 1991, Nintendo produced a line of handheld electronic games called Game & Watch. Created by game designer Gunpei Yokoi, each Game & Watch features a single game to be played on an LCD screen. It was the earliest Nintendo product to gain major success. Konami's Scramble, released in 1981, is a side-scrolling shooter with forced scrolling. It was the first scrolling shooter to offer multiple, distinct levels.Game Genres: Shmupsdate=December 2018 bot=InternetArchiveBot fix-attempted=yes }}, Professor Jim Whitehead, January 29, 2007. Accessed June 17, 2008 Vertical scrolling shooters emerged around the same time. Namco's Xevious, released in 1982, is frequently cited as the first vertical scrolling shooter and, although it was in fact preceded by several other games of that type, it is considered one of the most influential. The first platform game to use scrolling graphics was Jump Bug (1981), a simple platform-shooter game developed by Alpha Denshi. The North American video game industry was devastated by the 1983 video game crash, but in Japan, it was more of a surprise to developers, and typically known in Japan as the \\"Atari Shock\\". After the video game crash, analysts doubted the long-term viability of the video game industry. At the same time, following a series of arcade game successes in the early 1980s, Nintendo made plans to create a cartridge-based console called the Famicom, which is short for Family Computer. Masayuki Uemura designed the system. The console was released on July 15, 1983 as the Family Computer (or Famicom for short) alongside three ports of Nintendo's successful arcade games Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr. and Popeye. The Famicom was slow to gather momentum; a bad chip set caused the initial release of the system to crash. Following a product recall and a reissue with a new motherboard, the Famicom's popularity soared, becoming the best-selling game console in Japan by the end of 1984. By 1988, industry observers stated that the NES's popularity had grown so quickly that the market for Nintendo cartridges was larger than that for all home computer software. By mid-1986, 19% (6.5 million) of Japanese households owned a Famicom; one third by mid-1988. In June 1989, Nintendo of America's vice president of marketing Peter Main, said that the Famicom was present in 37% of Japan's households. By the end of its run, over 60 million NES units had been sold throughout the world. In 1990 Nintendo surpassed Toyota as Japan's most successful corporation. Because the NES was released after the \\"video game crash\\" of the early 1980s, many retailers and adults regarded electronic games as a passing fad, so many believed at first that the NES would soon fade. Before the NES/Famicom, Nintendo was known as a moderately successful Japanese toy and playing card manufacturer, but the popularity of the NES/Famicom helped the company grow into an internationally recognized name almost synonymous with video games as Atari had been, and set the stage for Japanese dominance of the video game industry. With the NES, Nintendo also changed the relationship between console manufacturers and third-party software developers by restricting developers from publishing and distributing software without licensed approval. This led to higher quality software titles, which helped change the attitude of a public that had grown weary from poorly produced titles for earlier game systems. The system's hardware limitations led to design principles that still influence the development of modern video games. Many prominent game franchises originated on the NES, including Nintendo's own Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda and Metroid, Capcom's Mega Man franchise, Konami's Castlevania franchise, Square's Final Fantasy,Kohler (2004), p. 95. and Enix's Dragon Quest franchises.Kohler (2004), p. 222. Following the release of the Famicom / Nintendo Entertainment System, the global video game industry began recovering, with annual sales exceeding $2.3 billion by 1988, with 70% of the market dominated by Nintendo. In 1986 Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi noted that \\"Atari collapsed because they gave too much freedom to third-party developers and the market was swamped with rubbish games\\". In response, Nintendo limited the number of titles that third-party developers could release for their system each year, and promoted its \\"Seal of Quality\\", which it allowed to be used on games and peripherals by publishers that met Nintendo's quality standards. Japan's first personal computers for gaming soon appeared, the Sord M200 in 1977 and Sharp MZ-80K in 1978. In Japan, both consoles and computers became major industries, with the console market dominated by Nintendo and the computer market dominated by NEC's PC-88 (1981) and PC-98 (1982). A key difference between Western and Japanese computers at the time was the display resolution, with Japanese systems using a higher resolution of 640x400 to accommodate Japanese text which in turn affected video game design and allowed more detailed graphics. Japanese computers were also using Yamaha's FM synth sound boards from the early 1980s. Reprinted from During the 16-bit era, the PC-98, Sharp X68000 and FM Towns became popular in Japan. The X68000 and FM Towns were capable of producing near arcade-quality hardware sprite graphics and sound quality when they first released in the mid-to-late 1980s. The Wizardry series (translated by ASCII Entertainment) became popular and influential in Japan, even more so than at home. Japanese developers created the action RPG subgenre in the early 1980s, combining RPG elements with arcade-style action and action-adventure elements. The trend of combining role-playing elements with arcade-style action mechanics was popularized by The Tower of Druaga, an arcade game released by Namco in June 1984. While the RPG elements in Druaga were very subtle, its success in Japan inspired the near-simultaneous development of three early action role-playing games, combining Druagas real-time hack-and- slash gameplay with stronger RPG mechanics, all released in late 1984: Dragon Slayer, Courageous Perseus, and Hydlide. A rivalry developed between the three games, with Dragon Slayer and Hydlide continuing their rivalry through subsequent sequels.John Szczepaniak (2016), The Untold History Of Japanese Game Developers, Volume 2, pages 38‚Äì49 The Tower of Druaga, Dragon Slayer and Hydlide were influential in Japan, where they laid the foundations for the action RPG genre, influencing titles such as Ys and The Legend of Zelda.John Szczepaniak (2016), The Untold History Of Japanese Game Developers, Volume 2, page 38 The action role-playing game Hydlide (1984) was an early open world game,1982‚Äì1987 ‚Äì The Birth of Japanese RPGs, re-told in 15 Games, Gamasutra rewarding exploration in an open world environment.

Zelda had an expansive, coherent open world design, inspiring many games to adopt a similar open world design. Bokosuka Wars (1983) is considered an early prototype real-time strategy game. TechnoSoft's Herzog (1988) is regarded as a precursor to the real-time strategy genre, being the predecessor to Herzog Zwei and somewhat similar in nature.Herzog Zwei , GameSpy Herzog Zwei, released for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis home console in 1989, is the earliest example of a game with a feature set that falls under the contemporary definition of modern real-time strategy.Zzap! Issue 68, December 1990, p.45 ‚Äì Data East's Karate Champ from 1984 is credited with establishing and popularizing the one-on-one fighting game genre, and went on to influence Konami's Yie Ar Kung-Fu from 1985. Capcom's Street Fighter (1987) introduced the use of special moves that could only be discovered by experimenting with the game controls. Street Fighter II (1991) established the conventions of the fighting game genre and allowed players to play against each other. In 1985, Sega AM2's Hang-On, designed by Yu Suzuki and running on the Sega Space Harrier hardware, was the first of Sega's \\"Super Scaler\\" arcade system boards that allowed pseudo-3D sprite-scaling at high frame rates. The pseudo-3D sprite/tile scaling was handled in a similar manner to textures in later texture-mapped polygonal 3D games of the 1990s. Designed by Sega AM2's Yu Suzuki, he stated that his \\"designs were always 3D from the beginning. All the calculations in the system were 3D, even from Hang-On. I calculated the position, scale, and zoom rate in 3D and converted it backwards to 2D. So I was always thinking in 3D.\\" It was controlled using a video game arcade cabinet resembling a motorbike, which the player moves with their body. This began the \\"Taikan\\" trend, the use of motion-controlled hydraulic arcade cabinets in many arcade games of the late 1980s, two decades before motion controls became popular on video game consoles. Sega's Space Harrier, a rail shooter released in 1985, broke new ground graphically and its wide variety of settings across multiple levels gave players more to aim for than high scores.Buchanan, Levi, Space Harrier Retrospective , IGN, September 5, 2008. Accessed February 17, 2009 1985 also saw the release of Konami's Gradius, which gave the player greater control over the choice of weaponry, thus introducing another element of strategy. The game also introduced the need for the player to memorise levels in order to achieve any measure of success.Ashcraft, p. 76 Gradius, with its iconic protagonist, defined the side-scrolling shoot 'em up and spawned a series spanning several sequels.Kasavin, Greg, Gradius Collection Review, GameSpot, June 7, 2006. Accessed February 12, 2009 The following year saw the emergence of one of Sega's forefront series with its game Fantasy Zone. The game received acclaim for its surreal graphics and setting and the protagonist, Opa-Opa, was for a time considered Sega's mascot.Fahs, Travis, Fantasy Zone Retrospective , IGN, October 1, 2008. Accessed February 13, 2009 The game borrowed Defender's device of allowing the player to control the direction of flight and along with the earlier TwinBee (1985), is an early archetype of the \\"cute 'em up\\" subgenre.Kalata, Kurt, Fantasy Zone , Hardcore Gaming 101. Accessed February 02, 2010 Hydlide II: Shine of Darkness in 1985 featured an early morality meter, where the player can be aligned with justice, normal, or evil, which is affected by whether the player kills evil monsters, good monsters, or humans, and in turn affects the reactions of the townsfolk towards the player. In the same year, Yuji Horii and his team at Chunsoft began production on Dragon Quest (Dragon Warrior). After Enix published the game in early 1986, it became the template for future console RPGs. Horii's intention behind Dragon Quest was to create a RPG that appeals to a wider audience unfamiliar with the genre or video games in general. This required the creation of a new kind of RPG, that didn't rely on previous D&D; experience, didn't require hundreds of hours of rote fighting, and that could appeal to any kind of gamer. The streamlined gameplay of Dragon Quest thus made the game more accessible to a wider audience than previous computer RPGs. The game also placed a greater emphasis on storytelling and emotional involvement, building on Horii's previous work Portopia Serial Murder Case, but this time introducing a coming of age tale for Dragon Quest that audiences could relate to, making use of the RPG level-building gameplay as a way to represent this. It also featured elements still found in most console RPGs, like major quests interwoven with minor subquests, an incremental spell system, the damsel-in-distress storyline that many RPGs follow, and a romance element that remains a staple of the genre, alongside anime-style art by Akira Toriyama and a classical score by Koichi Sugiyama that was considered revolutionary for console video game music. With Dragon Quest becoming widely popular in Japan, such that local municipalities were forced to place restrictions on where and when the game could be sold, the Dragon Quest series is still considered a bellwether for the Japanese video game market. Shoot 'em ups featuring characters on foot, rather than spacecraft, became popular in the mid-1980s in the wake of action movies such as Rambo: First Blood Part II.The History of SNK , GameSpot. Accessed February 16, 2009 The origins of this type go back to Sheriff by Nintendo, released in 1979. Taito's Front Line (1982) established the upwards-scrolling formula later popularized by Capcom's Commando, in 1985, and SNK's Ikari Warriors (1986).Bielby, Matt, \\"The YS Complete Guide To Shoot-'em-ups Part II\\", Your Sinclair, August 1990 (issue 56), p. 19 Commando also drew comparisons to RamboSegre, Nicole, \\"Commando,\\" Sinclair User, February 1986 (issue 47) and indeed contemporary critics considered military themes and protagonists similar to Rambo or Schwarzenegger prerequisites for a shoot 'em up, as opposed to an action-adventure game. In 1986, Arsys Software released WiBArm, a shooter that switched between a 2D side-scrolling view in outdoor areas to a fully 3D polygonal third-person perspective inside buildings, while bosses were fought in an arena-style 2D battle, with the game featuring a variety of weapons and equipment. Reprinted from The late 1980s to early 1990s is considered the golden age of Japanese computer gaming, which would flourish until its decline around the mid-1990s, as consoles eventually dominated the Japanese market. Reprinted from A notable Japanese computer RPG from around this time was WiBArm, the earliest known RPG to feature 3D polygonal graphics. It was a 1986 role-playing shooter released by Arsys Software for the PC-88 in Japan and ported to MS-DOS for Western release by Br√∏derbund. In WiBArm, the player controls a transformable mecha robot, switching between a 2D side-scrolling view during outdoor exploration to a fully 3D polygonal third-person perspective inside buildings, while bosses are fought in an arena-style 2D shoot 'em up battle. The game featured a variety of weapons and equipment as well as an automap, and the player could upgrade equipment and earn experience to raise stats. (Reprinted from Retro Gamer, Issue 67, 2009) (Translation) Unlike first-person RPGs at the time that were restricted to 90-degree movements, WiBArm's use of 3D polygons allowed full 360-degree movement. The PC Engine, released in 1987. On October 30, 1987, the PC Engine made its debut in the Japanese market and it was a tremendous success. The console had an elegant, \\"eye-catching\\" design, and it was very small compared to its rivals. The PC Engine, TurboGrafx-16, known as TurboGrafx-16 in the rest of the world, was a collaborative effort between Hudson Soft, who created video game software, and NEC, a major company which was dominant in the Japanese personal computer market with their PC-88 and PC-98 platforms. R-Type, an acclaimed side-scrolling shoot 'em up, was released in 1987 by Irem, employing slower paced scrolling than usual, with difficult levels calling for methodical strategies.Buchanan, Levi, Top 10 Classic Shoot 'Em Ups , IGN, April 8, 2008, May 26, 2009Todd, Brett, R-Type Dimensions Review, GameSpot, February 7, 2009.

Accessed February 13, 2009Buchanan, Levi, Raiden , IGN, February 17, 2004. Accessed February 13, 2009 In 1987, Square's 3-D WorldRunner was an early stereoscopic 3-D shooter played from a third-person perspective, followed later that year by its sequel JJ, and the following year by Space Harrier 3-D which used the SegaScope 3-D shutter glasses. Also in 1987, Konami created Contra as a coin-op arcade game that was particularly acclaimed for its multi-directional aiming and two player cooperative gameplay. Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei by Atlus for the Nintendo Famicom abandoned the common medieval fantasy setting and sword and sorcery theme in favour of a modern science-fiction setting and horror theme. It also introduced the monster-catching mechanic with its demon-summoning system, which allowed the player to recruit enemies into their party, through a conversation system that gives the player a choice of whether to kill or spare an enemy and allows them to engage any opponent in conversation. Sega's original Phantasy Star for the Master System combined sci-fi & fantasy setting that set it apart from the D&D; staple. It was also one of the first games to feature a female protagonist and animated monster encounters, and allowed inter-planetary travel between three planets. Another 1987 title Miracle Warriors: Seal of the Dark Lord was a third-person RPG that featured a wide open world and a mini- map on the corner of the screen. According to Wizardry developer Roe R. Adams, early action-adventure games \\"were basically arcade games done in a fantasy setting,\\" citing Castlevania (1986) and Trojan (1986) as examples. IGN UK argues that The Legend of Zelda (1986) \\"helped to establish a new subgenre of action-adventure\\", becoming a success due to how it combined elements from different genres to create a compelling hybrid, including exploration, adventure-style inventory puzzles, an action component, a monetary system, and simplified RPG-style level building without the experience points. The Legend of Zelda was the most prolific action-adventure game series through to the 2000s. The first Nintendo Space World show was held on July 28, 1989. It was a video game trade show that was hosted by Nintendo until 2001. At the same year, Phantasy Star II for the Genesis established many conventions of the RPG genre, including an epic, dramatic, character-driven storyline dealing with serious themes and subject matter, and a strategy-based battle system. The game's science fiction story was also unique, reversing the common alien invasion scenario by instead presenting Earthlings as the invading antagonists rather than the defending protagonists. Capcom's Sweet Home for the NES introduced a modern Japanese horror theme and laid the foundations for the survival horror genre, later serving as the main inspiration for Resident Evil (1996). Tengai Makyo: Ziria released for the PC Engine CD that same year was the first RPG released on CD-ROM and the first in the genre to feature animated cut scenes and voice acting. The game's plot was also unusual for its feudal Japan setting and its emphasis on humour; the plot and characters were inspired by the Japanese folk tale Jiraiya Goketsu Monogatari. The music for the game was also composed by noted musician Ryuichi Sakamoto. The ‚Äògolden age‚Äô of console RPGs is often dated in the 1990s. Console RPGs distinguished themselves from computer RPGs to a greater degree in the early 1990s. As console RPGs became more heavily story-based than their computer counterparts, one of the major differences that emerged during this time was in the portrayal of the characters, with most American computer RPGs at the time having characters devoid of personality or background as their purpose was to represent avatars which the player uses to interact with the world, in contrast to Japanese console RPGs which depicted pre-defined characters who had distinctive personalities, traits, and relationships, such as Final Fantasy and Lufia, with players assuming the roles of people who cared about each other, fell in love or even had families. Romance in particular was a theme that was common in most console RPGs but alien to most computer RPGs at the time. Japanese console RPGs were also generally more faster-paced and action-adventure-oriented than their American computer counterparts. During the 1990s, console RPGs had become increasingly dominant. In 1990, Dragon Quest IV introduced a new method of storytelling: segmenting the plot into segregated chapters. The game also introduced an AI system called \\"Tactics\\" which allowed the player to modify the strategies used by the allied party members while maintaining full control of the hero. Final Fantasy III introduced the classic \\"job system\\", a character progression engine allowing the player to change the character classes, as well as acquire new and advanced classes and combine class abilities, during the course of the game. That same year also saw the release of Nintendo's Fire Emblem: Ankoku Ryu to Hikari no Tsurugi, a game that set the template for the tactical role-playing game genre and was the first entry in the Fire Emblem series. Another notable strategy RPG that year was Koei's Bandit Kings of Ancient China, which was successful in combining the strategy RPG and management simulation genres, building on its own Nobunaga's Ambition series that began in 1983. Several early RPGs set in a post-apocalyptic future were also released that year, including Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei II, and Crystalis, which was inspired by Hayao Miyazaki's Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. Crystalis also made advances to the action role-playing game subgenre, being a true action RPG that combined the real-time action-adventure combat and open world of The Legend of Zelda with the level-building and spell-casting of traditional RPGs like Final Fantasy. That year also saw the release of Phantasy Star III: Generations of Doom, which featured an innovative and original branching storyline, which spans three generations of characters and can be altered depending on which character the protagonist of each generation marries, leading to four possible endings. In 1991, Final Fantasy IV was one of the first role-playing games to feature a complex, involving plot, placing a much greater emphasis on character development, personal relationships, and dramatic storytelling. It also introduced a new battle system: the \\"Active Time Battle\\" system, developed by Hiroyuki Ito, where the time-keeping system does not stop. The fact that enemies can attack or be attacked at any time is credited with injecting urgency and excitement into the combat system. The ATB combat system was considered revolutionary for being a hybrid between turn- based and real-time combat, with its requirement of faster reactions from players appealing to those who were more used to action games. Super Famicom, released on November 21, 1990. Nintendo executives were initially reluctant to design a new system, but as the market transitioned to the newer hardware, Nintendo saw the erosion of the commanding market share it had built up with the Nintendo Entertainment System. Nintendo's fourth-generation console, the Super Famicom, was released in Japan on November 21, 1990; Nintendo's initial shipment of 300,000 units sold out within hours. Despite stiff competition from the Mega Drive/Genesis console, the Super NES eventually took the top selling position, selling 49.10 million units worldwide, and would remain popular well into the fifth generation of consoles. Nintendo's market position was defined by their machine's increased video and sound capabilities, as well as exclusive first-party franchise titles such as Super Mario World, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Super Metroid. In the early 1990s, the arcades experienced a major resurgence with the 1991 release of Capcom's Street Fighter II, which popularized competitive fighting games and revived the arcade industry to a level of popularity not seen since the days of Pac- Man,Spencer, Spanner, The Tao of Beat-'em-ups (part 2), EuroGamer, 12 February 2008. Retrieved 8 March 2009 setting off a renaissance for the arcade game industry in the early 1990s. Its success led to a wave of other popular games which mostly were in the fighting genre, such as Fatal Fury: King of Fighters (1992) by SNK, Virtua Fighter (1993) by SEGA, and The King of Fighters (1994‚Äì2005) by SNK. In 1993, Electronic Games noted that when \\"historians look back at the world of coin-op during the early 1990s, one of the defining highlights of the video game art form will undoubtedly focus on fighting/martial arts themes\\" which it described as \\"the backbone of the industry\\" at the time. A new type of shoot 'em up emerged in the early 1990s: variously termed \\"bullet hell\\", \\"manic shooters\\", \\"maniac shooters\\" and , these games required the player to dodge overwhelming numbers of enemy projectiles and called for still more consistent reactions from players.Ashcraft, p. 77 Bullet hell games arose from the need for 2D shoot 'em up developers to compete with the emerging popularity of 3D games: huge numbers of missiles on screen were intended to impress players. Toaplan's Batsugun (1993) provided the prototypical template for this new breed, with Cave (formed by former employees of Toaplan, including Batsugun's main creator Tsuneki Ikeda, after the latter company collapsed) inventing the type proper with 1995's DonPachi.Ashcraft, pp. 78-80 Bullet hell games marked another point where the shoot 'em up genre began to cater to more dedicated players. Games such as Gradius had been more difficult than Space Invaders or Xevious, but bullet hell games were yet more inward-looking and aimed at dedicated fans of the genre looking for greater challenges.Ashcraft, pp. 77-78 While shooter games featuring protagonists on foot largely moved to 3D-based genres, popular, long-running series such as Contra and Metal Slug continued to receive new sequels.Magrino, Tom, Contra conquering DS , GameSpot, June 20, 2007.

It has also been credited as the first known video game to feature a playable pregnancy, a concept that has since appeared in later games such as Story of Seasons. Dragon Quest V's monster-collecting mechanic, where monsters can be defeated, captured, added to the party, and gain their own experience levels, also influenced many later franchises such as Pok√©mon, Digimon and Dokapon. In turn, the concept of collecting everything in a game, in the form of achievements or similar rewards, has since become a common trend in video games. Shin Megami Tensei, released in 1992 for the SNES, introduced an early moral alignment system that influences the direction and outcome of the storyline, leading to different possible paths and multiple endings. This has since become a hallmark of the Megami Tensei series. Another non-linear RPG released that year was Romancing Saga, an open-world RPG by Square that offered many choices and allowed players to complete quests in any order, with the decision of whether or not to participate in any particular quest affecting the outcome of the storyline. The game also allowed players to choose from eight different characters, each with their own stories that start in different places and offer different outcomes. Data East's Heracles no Eik≈ç III, written by Kazushige Nojima, introduced the plot element of a nameless immortal suffering from amnesia, and Nojima would later revisit the amnesia theme in Final Fantasy VII and Glory of Heracles. The TurboGrafx-CD port of Dragon Knight II released that year was also notable for introducing erotic adult content to consoles, though such content had often appeared in Japanese computer RPGs since the early 1980s. That same year, Game Arts began the Lunar series on the Sega CD with Lunar: The Silver Star, one of the first successful CD-ROM RPGs, featuring both voice and text, and considered one of the best RPGs in its time. The game was praised for its soundtrack, emotionally engaging storyline, and strong characterization. It also introduced an early form of level-scaling where the bosses would get stronger depending on the protagonist's level, a mechanic that was later used in Enix's The 7th Saga and extended to normal enemies in Square's Romancing Saga 3 and later Final Fantasy VIII. 3D polygon graphics were popularized by the Sega Model 1 games Virtua Racing (1992) and Virtua Fighter (1993), followed by racing games like the Namco System 22 title Ridge Racer (1993) and Sega Model 2 title Daytona USA, and light gun shooters like Sega's Virtua Cop (1994),Virtua Cop , IGN, 7 July 2004. Retrieved 7 February 2009 gaining considerable popularity in the arcades. In 1993, Square's Secret of Mana, the second in the Mana series, further advanced the action RPG subgenre with its introduction of cooperative multiplayer into the genre. The game was created by a team previously responsible for the first three Final Fantasy titles: Nasir Gebelli, Koichi Ishii, and Hiromichi Tanaka. The game received considerable acclaim, for its innovative pausable real-time battle system, the \\"Ring Command\\" menu system, its innovative cooperative multiplayer gameplay, where the second or third players could drop in and out of the game at any time rather than players having to join the game at the same time, and the customizable AI settings for computer-controlled allies. The game has influenced a number of later action RPGs. That same year also saw the release of Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium, which introduced the use of pre-programmable combat manoeuvers called 'macros', a means of setting up the player's party AI to deliver custom attack combos. That year also saw the release of Romancing Saga 2, which further expanded the non-linear gameplay of its predecessor. While in the original Romancing Saga, scenarios were changed according to dialogue choices during conversations, Romancing Saga 2 further expanded on this by having unique storylines for each character that can change depending on the player's actions, including who is chosen, what is said in conversation, what events have occurred, and who is present in the party. PCGamesN credits Romancing SaGa 2 for having laid the foundations for modern Japanese RPGs with its progressive, non-linear, open world design and subversive themes. In 1994, Final Fantasy VI moved away from the medieval setting of its predecessors, instead being set in a steampunk environment,. The game received considerable acclaim, and is seen as one of the greatest RPGs of all time, for improvements such as its broadened thematic scope, plotlines, characters, multiple-choice scenarios, and variation of play. Final Fantasy VI dealt with mature themes such as suicide, war crimes, child abandonment, teen pregnancy, and coping with the deaths of loved ones. Square's Live A Live, released for the Super Famicom in Japan, featured eight different characters and stories, with the first seven unfolding in any order the player chooses, as well as four different endings. The game's ninja chapter in particular was an early example of stealth game elements in an RPG, requiring the player to infiltrate a castle, rewarding the player if the entire chapter can be completed without engaging in combat. Other chapters had similar innovations, such as Akira's chapter where the character uses telepathic powers to discover information. Robotrek by Quintet and Ancient was a predecessor to Pok√©mon in the sense that the protagonist does not himself fight, but sends out his robots to do so. Like Pok√©mon, Robotrek was designed to appeal to a younger audience, allowed team customization, and each robot was kept in a ball. FromSoftware released their first video game, titled King's Field, as a launch title for the PlayStation in 1994. The game was later called the brainchild of company CEO Naotoshi Jin, who was later considered a key creative figure in the series. The eventual success of the first King's Field prompted the development of sequels, establishing the King's Field series. The design of King's Field would influence later titles by FromSoftware including Shadow Tower, which used similar mechanics to King's Field; and Demon's Souls, described by its staff as a spiritual successor to King's Field, and inspired multiple follow- up titles which form part of the Souls series and propelled FromSoftware to international fame. In 1995, Square's Romancing Saga 3 featured a storyline that could be told differently from the perspectives of up to eight different characters and introduced a level-scaling system where the enemies get stronger as the characters do, a mechanic that was later used in a number of later RPGs, including Final Fantasy VIII. Sega's Sakura Wars for the Saturn combined tactical RPG combat with dating sim and visual novel elements, introducing a real-time branching choice system where, during an event or conversation, the player must choose an action or dialogue choice within a time limit, or not to respond at all within that time; the player's choice, or lack thereof, affects the player character's relationship with other characters and in turn the characters' performance in battle, the direction of the storyline, and the ending. Later games in the series added several variations, including an action gauge that can be raised up or down depending on the situation, and a gauge that the player can manipulate using the analog stick depending on the situation. The success of Sakura Wars led to a wave of games that combine the RPG and dating sim genres, including Thousand Arms in 1998, Riviera: The Promised Land in 2002, and Luminous Arc in 2007. The survival horror video game genre began with Capcom's Resident Evil (1996), which coined the term \\"survival horror\\" and defined the genre.\\"Enter The Survival Horror... A Resident Evil Retrospective,\\" Game Informer 174 (October 2007): 132-133. The game was inspired by Capcom's Sweet Home (1989), retroactively described as survival horror. The first Tokyo Game Show was held in 1996. From 1996 to 2002, the show was held twice a year: once in the Spring and once in Autumn (in the Tokyo Big Sight). Since 2002, the show has been held once a year. It attracts more visitors every year. 2011's show hosted over 200,000 attendees and the 2012 show bringing in 223,753. The busiest TGS was in 2016 with 271,224 people in attendance and 614 companies had exhibits. The event has been held annually since 1996 and was never canceled. The 20th anniversary of TGS was celebrated in 2016. The Fujitsu FM Towns Marty is considered the world's first 32-bit console (predating the Amiga CD32 and 3DO), being released only released in Japan on February 20, 1993 by Fujitsu. However, it failed to make an impact in the marketplace due to its expense relative to other consoles and inability to compete with home computers. Around the mid-1990s, the fifth-generation home consoles, Sega Saturn, PlayStation, and Nintendo 64, began offering true 3D graphics, improved sound, and better 2D graphics, than the previous generation. By 1995, personal computers followed, with 3D accelerator cards. While arcade systems such as the Sega Model 3 remained considerably more advanced than home systems in the late 1990s. The next major revolution came in the mid-to-late 1990s, which saw the rise of 3D computer graphics and optical discs in fifth generation consoles. The implications for RPGs were enormous‚Äîlonger, more involved quests, better audio, and full-motion video. This was clearly demonstrated in 1997 by the phenomenal success of Final Fantasy VII, which is considered one of the most influential games of all time, akin to that of Star Wars in the movie industry. With a record-breaking production budget of around $45 million, the ambitious scope of Final Fantasy VII raised the possibilities for the genre, with its more expansive world to explore, much longer quest, more numerous sidequests, dozens of minigames, and much higher production values. The latter includes innovations such as the use of 3D characters on pre- rendered backgrounds, battles viewed from multiple different angles rather than a single angle, and for the first time full-motion CGI video seamlessly blended into the gameplay, effectively integrated throughout the game. Gameplay innovations included the materia system, which allowed a considerable amount of customization and flexibility through materia that can be combined in many different ways and exchanged between characters at any time, and the limit breaks, special attacks that can be performed after a character's limit meter fills up by taking hits from opponents. Final Fantasy VII continues to be listed among the best games of all time, for its highly polished gameplay, high playability, lavish production, well-developed characters, intricate storyline, and an emotionally engaging narrative that is much darker and sophisticated than most other RPGs. The game's storytelling and character development was considered a major narrative jump forward for video games and was often compared to films and novels at the time. One of the earliest Japanese RPGs, Koei's The Dragon and Princess (1982), (Translation) featured a tactical turn-based combat system. Koji Sumii's Bokosuka Wars, originally released for the Sharp X1 computer in 1983 and later ported to the NES in 1985, (translation) is credited for laying the foundations for the tactical RPG genre, or \\"simulation RPG\\" genre as it is known in Japan, with its blend of basic RPG and strategy game elements. The genre became with the game that set the template for tactical RPGs, Fire Emblem: Ankoku Ry≈´ to Hikari no Tsurugi (1990). Treasure's shoot 'em up, Radiant Silvergun (1998), introduced an element of narrative to the genre.

Girls playing The House of the Dead III in an amusement arcade in Japan, 2005. PlayStation 3 at Tokyo Game Show 2006 In 2002, the Japanese video game industry made up about 50% of the global market; that share has since shrunk to around 10% by 2010. The shrinkage in market share has been attributed to a difference of taste between Japanese and Western audiences, and the country's economic recession. Nintendo had seen record revenues, net sales and profits in 2009 as a result of the release of the Nintendo DS and Wii in 2004 and 2006, respectively, but in Nintendo's subsequent years, its revenues had declined. In 2009, FromSoftware released Demon's Souls for the PlayStation 3, which brought them international exposure. Its spiritual successor, Dark Souls, was released in 2011. In March 2014, Dark Souls II, was released, while Dark Souls III was released in 2016. A title inspired by the Souls series, Bloodborne, was released in March 2015. The Souls series, along with Bloodborne, received widespread critical acclaim, as well as strong sales domestically and internationally.May 8, 2014, Financial Highlights for the Fiscal Year Ended March 2014, NAMCO BANDAI Holdings Inc.May 7, 2014, Dark Souls II Ships 1.2 Million In U.S. And Europe, Siliconera They have also received a number of awards, primarily those for the role-playing genre, including multiple \\"RPG of the Year\\" and Game of the Year awards. Since release, Dark Souls and Bloodborne have been cited by many publications to be among the greatest games of all time. The decline of the Japanese video game development industry during this period was partially attributed to the traditional development process. Japanese companies were criticized for long development times and slow release dates on home video game consoles, their lack of third-party game engines, and for being too insular to appeal to a global market. Yoichi Wada stated in the Financial Times on April 27, 2009 that the Japanese video game development industry has become a \\"closed environment\\" and \\"almost xenophobic.\\" He also stated: \\"The lag with the US is very clear. The US games industry was not good in the past but it has now attracted people from the computer industry and from Hollywood, which has led to strong growth.\\" At the 2010 Tokyo Game Show, Keiji Inafune stated that \\"Everyone's making awful games - Japan is at least five years behind\\", and that \\"Japan is isolated in the gaming world. If something doesn't change, we're doomed.\\", stressing the need for Japanese developers to bring in Western approaches to game development to make a comeback. Related to the isolationism, games developed in Western countries did not perform well in Japan, whereas Japanese games were readily played by Western market consumers. Foreign games often sell more poorly in Japanese markets due to differences in what consumers expect for escapism between these cultures. Microsoft had attempted to push both the Xbox and Xbox 360 consoles in Japan with poor success, at they struggled to compete against Sony and Nintendo there. However, as detailed above, Japanese console games became less successful, even in their own country, as of 2013. In the Japanese gaming industry, arcades have remained popular through to the present day. As of 2009, out of Japan's $20 billion gaming market, $6 billion of that amount is generated from arcades, which represent the largest sector of the Japanese video game market, followed by home console games and mobile games at $3.5 billion and $2 billion, respectively. In 2005, arcade ownership and operation accounted for a majority of Namco's for example. With considerable withdrawal from the arcade market from companies such as Capcom, Sega became the strongest player in the arcade market with 60% marketshare in 2006. Despite the global decline of arcades, Japanese companies hit record revenue for three consecutive years during this period.https://www.segasammy.co.jp/english/ir/library/pdf/printing_annual/2008/e_2008_annual.pdf Page 16: \\" The domestic market has continued to expand for five years and has set new records for three consecutive years.\\" However, due to the country's economic recession, the Japanese arcade industry has also been steadily declining, from ¬•702.9 billion (US$8.7 billion) in 2007 to ¬•504.3 billion ($6.2 billion) in 2010. In 2013, estimation of revenue is ¬•470 billion. In the 2010s, Japanese RPGs have been experiencing a resurgence on PC, with a significant increase in the number of Japanese RPGs releasing for the Steam platform. This began with the 2010 release of doujin/indie game Recettear (2007) for Steam, selling over 500,000 units on the platform. This led to many Japanese doujin/indie games releasing on Steam in subsequent years. Beyond doujin/indie titles, 2012 was a breakthrough year, with the debut of Nihon Falcom's Ys series on Steam and then the Steam release of From Software's Dark Souls, which sold millions on the platform. Other Japanese RPGs were subsequently ported to Steam, such as the previously niche Valkyria Chronicles which became a million-seller on the platform, and other titles that sold hundreds of thousands on Steam, such as the 2014 localization of The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky (2014) and ports of numerous Final Fantasy titles. Japanese developers have been increasingly considering Steam as a viable platform for the genre, with many Japanese RPGs available on the platform. By 2015, Japan had become the world's fourth largest PC game market, behind only China, the United States, and South Korea. The Japanese game development engine RPG Maker has also gained significant popularity on Steam, including hundreds of commercial games. Every year, hundreds of games released on Steam are created using RPG Maker, as of 2017. In the present day, Japan is the world's largest market for mobile games. The Japanese market today is becoming increasingly dominated by mobile games, which generated $5.1 billion in 2013, more than traditional console games in the country. Former rivals in the Japanese arcade industry, Konami, Taito, Bandai Namco Entertainment and Sega, are now working together to keep the arcade industry vibrant. This is evidenced in the sharing of arcade networks, and venues having games from all major companies rather than only games from their own company. =2016 - present = Japanese players at a shoot 'em up arcade in Akihabara, Tokyo. (2017) A line graph depicting the first-year sales of the Nintendo Switch (red), Wii U (green), and PlayStation 4 (blue) in Japan. The eighth generation of video game consoles primarily includes the home video game consoles of the Wii U released in 2012, the PlayStation 4 family in 2013; the handheld game consoles of the Nintendo 3DS in 2011, Nintendo 2DS in 2013, and the PlayStation Vita in 2011; as well as the first hybrid game console, the Nintendo Switch in 2017, which played as a handheld but could be docked to played like a home console. Unlike in most prior generations, there were few new innovative hardware capabilities to mark this generation as distinct from prior ones. Sony continued to produce new systems with similar designs and capabilities as their predecessors, but with improved performance (processing speed, higher-resolution graphics, and increased storage capacity) that further moved consoles into confluence with personal computers, and furthering support for digital distribution and games as a service. Motion-controlled games of the seventh generation had waned in popularity, but consoles were preparing for advancement of virtual reality (VR); Sony introduced the PlayStation VR in 2016. Though prior console generations have normally occurred in five to six-year cycles, the transition from seventh to eighth generation lasted approximately eight years. The transition is also unusual in that the prior generation's best-selling unit, the Wii, was the first to be replaced in the eighth generation. In 2011, Sony considered themselves only halfway through a ten-year lifecycle for their seventh-generation offerings. Interview with Jack Tretton, president and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment America. Nintendo president Satoru Iwata had stated that his company would be releasing the Wii U due to declining sales of seventh generation home consoles and that \\"the market is now waiting for a new proposal for home consoles\\". Sony considered making its next console a digital download only machine, but decided against it due to concerns about the inconsistency of internet speeds available globally, especially in developing countries. On September 13, 2012, Nintendo announced that the Wii U would launch in Japan on December 8, 2012. The PlayStation 4 and Wii U use AMD GPUs, and the PS4 also use AMD CPUs on an x86-64 architecture, similar to common personal computers (as opposed to the IBM PowerPC Architecture used in the previous generation). Nintendo and Sony were not aware that they were all using AMD hardware until their consoles were announced. This shift was considered to be beneficial for multi-platform development, due to the increased similarities between PC hardware and console hardware. In October 2013, online retailer Play.com announced that its Wii U sales saw a 75% sales increase. The company also predicted that the Wii U would be more popular than its competition, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, among children during the holiday season. Following the release of Wii Party U on October 31 in Japan, weekly Wii U sales spiked to 38,802 units sold. During the first two weeks of December, the Wii U was the top performing home console in Japan, with 123,665 units sold. In fiscal year (FY) 2013 (ending early 2013), Nintendo sold 23.7 million consoles. By February 26, 2014, Wii U sales had surpassed those of the Xbox 360 in Japan. However, by June 2015, the basic Wii U was discontinued in Japan, and replaced by a 32 GB \\"Premium\\" set that includes white hardware and a Wii Remote Plus. In mid-November 2016, Nintendo announced that Japanese production of the Wii U would be ending \\"in the near future\\". The PS4 was released in Japan at ¬•39,980 on February 22, 2014. In September 2015, Sony reduced the price of the PS4 in Japan to ¬•34,980, with similar price drops in other Southeast Asian markets. Within the first two days of release in Japan during the weekend of February 22, 2014, 322,083 consoles were sold.2014-02-25, „Éó„É¨„Ç§„Çπ„ÉÜ„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥4„ÅåÁô∫Â£≤2Êó•Èñì„Åß32‰∏á2083Âè∞„ÇíË≤©Â£≤ , Famitsu PS4 software unit sales surpassed 20.5 million on April 13, 2014. During Japan's 2013 fiscal year, heightened demand for the PS4 helped Sony top global console sales, beating Nintendo for the first time in eight years. Since 2016, Japanese video games have been experiencing a resurgence, as part of a renaissance for the Japanese video game industry. In 2017, Japanese video games gained further commercial success and greater critical acclaim. In 2016, the global success of Pok√©mon Go helped Pok√©mon Sun and Moon set sales records around the world. Final Fantasy XV was also a major success, selling millions. There were also other Japanese RPGs that earned commercial success and/or critical acclaim that year, including Dragon Quest VII: Fragments of the Forgotten Past, Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse, Bravely Second, Fire Emblem Fates, Dragon Quest Builders, World of Final Fantasy, Exist Archive: The Other Side of the Sky and I Am Setsuna. Anticipating the release of the console's successor, the Nintendo Switch, a hybrid video game console, Nintendo had planned to diminish production of the Wii U. It formally announced the end of its production on January 31, 2017. The company had posted its first loss as a video game company in 2012 prior to the Wii U's introduction that year, and had similar losses in the following years due to the console's poor uptake. The New York Times attributed Nintendo lowering financial forecasts in 2014 to weak hardware sales against mobile gaming. Previously, the company had been hesitant about this market, with then-president Satoru Iwata considering that they would \\"cease to be Nintendo\\" and lose their identity if they attempted to enter it. About three years prior to the Switch's announcement, Iwata, Tatsumi Kimishima, Genyo Takeda, and Shigeru Miyamoto crafted a strategy for revitalizing Nintendo's business model, which included approaching the mobile market, creating new hardware, and \\"maximizing [their] intellectual property\\". Prior to his death, Iwata was able to secure a business alliance with Japanese mobile provider DeNA to develop mobile titles based on Nintendo's first-party franchises, believing this approach would not compromise their integrity. Following Iwata's death in July 2015, Kimishima was named as president of Nintendo, while Miyamoto was promoted to the title of \\"Creative Fellow\\". The Switch was officially released on March 3, 2017 in Japan with an MSRP of . The design of the Switch was aimed to bridge the polarization of the gaming market at the time, creating a device that could play \\"leisurely\\" video games along with games that are aimed to be played \\"deeply\\", according to Shinya Takahashi and Yoshiaki Koizumi, general manager and deputy general manager of Nintendo's Entertainment Planning & Development Division (EPD), respectively. This approach also would apply to the cultural lifestyle and gaming differences between Japanese and Western players; Japanese players tend to play on the go and with social groups, while Western players tend to play at home by themselves. The design of the Switch would meet both cultures, and certain games, like 1-2-Switch, could potentially make social gaming more acceptable in Western culture. Two key elements that were set to address this mixed market were the ability for the unit to play both on a television screen and as a portable, and the use of detachable controllers. In Japan, first weekend sales exceeded 330,000 units, which was on par with the PlayStation 4 during its launch period. Media Create estimated that more than 500,000 Switch units were sold in Japan within its first month, beating out the PlayStation 4 to this figure. Console sales in Japan, which had been languishing due to the strength of the mobile game market, saw its first annual growth of 14.8% in 2017 due to the release of the Switch. Based on its first year sales, the Switch was considered to be the fastest-selling game console in history in many regions. With 2017 year end Japanese sales data from Media Create, the Switch became the fastest-selling home console in Japan in first year sales, with its total sales of 3.2 million units exceeding the 3.0 million units of the PlayStation 2 during its first year of release, while Famitsu reported that these sales had eclipsed the lifetime sales of the Wii U in the country, and helped to support the first growth in sales within Japan's console market in eleven years. By May 2019, the Switch had overtaken the PS4's lifetime sales in Japan. In 2017, Japanese RPGs gained further commercial success and greater critical acclaim. The year started strong with Gravity Rush 2, followed by Yakuza 0, which some critics consider the best in the Yakuza series, Nioh which is considered to have one of the eighth-generation's best RPG combat systems, and then Nier Automata which has gameplay and storytelling thought to be some of the best in recent years. Persona 5 won the Best Role Playing Game award at The Game Awards 2017. Some Japanese RPGs that were previously considered niche became mainstream million-sellers in 2017, including Persona 5, Nier: Automata, Nioh, and Xenoblade Chronicles 2 on the Nintendo Switch. 2017 was considered a strong year for Japanese RPGs, with other notable releases including Dragon Quest VIII on the Nintendo 3DS, Tales of Berseria, Valkyria Revolution, Ever Oasis, Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age, Ys VIII, Etrian Odyssey V, Dragon Quest Heroes II, The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky the 3rd, Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia, Final Fantasy XIV: Stormblood, and Tokyo Xanadu. In 2018, Monster Hunter: World sold over 10million units, becoming Capcom's best-selling single software title, and Square Enix's Octopath Traveler sold over 1million units. Sony have announced plans for the PlayStation 5 to be released in 2020 and have emphasized that they want this to be a soft transition, allowing PlayStation 4 games to be directly backwards compatible on their respective systems. Sony has stated the \\"overwhelming majority\\" of PlayStation 4 games will play on the PlayStation 5, with many running at higher frame rates and resolutions.

This \\"alleged treaty\\" was contrived in a coercive process; and Koreans sought to invalidate the unwanted consequences by presenting evidence to the international community. For example, * 1905: Emperor Gojong of the Korean Empire wrote personally to the heads of state in those countries having treaties with Korea; and the Korean government filed formal appeals and sent formal cable notices,Korean Mission ; excerpt, \\"The foregoing are in addition to the appeal of the Emperor of Korea, filed in the State Department on November 25, 1905, and his cable notice of the illegality of the claimed protectorate, filed in the State Department on November 26, 1905.\\" but these diplomatic gestures were unavailing. * 1907: In what is sometimes called the \\"Hague Secret Emissary Affair,\\" Korean emissaries sought unsuccessfully to seek international assistance at the Hague Convention of 1907 at The Hague, Netherlands in 1907.Eckert, Carter J. et al. (1990). Korea Old and New: A History, p. 245. * 1921: Korean representatives attempted to gain a hearing at the Washington Naval Conference of 1921;Korean Mission but the effort was ineffective. This treaty was confirmed to be \\"already null and void\\" by Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea concluded in 1965. \\"It is confirmed that all treaties or agreements concluded between the Empire of Japan and the Empire of Korea on or before August 22, 1910 are already null and void.\\" In 2010, Japan argued that the chronological point of reference for \\"already null and void\\" was August 15, 1948, when the government of the Republic of Korea was established. This point of view is disputed by the Korean analysis, which construes the 1965 treaty as acknowledgment of the nullification of all Japanese-Korean treaties and agreements from 1904 onwards.Lee Man-yeol. \\"For a view of history that puts us at the center,\\" Northeast Asian History Foundation News. 2010.

It stars Victor McLaglen and Edmund Lowe playing the same characters with different names that they played in What Price Glory? and several sequels; however the original film trailer mentions What Price Glory? and The Cock-Eyed World.http://www.tcm.com/mediaroom/index.jsp?cid=74368 The film features extensive stock footage from RKO's Soldiers of the Sea that in some cases appear on process screens that the actors stand in front of. Plot Ex-Marines Jimmy McGinnis (Victor McLaglen) and Harry Curtis (Edmund Lowe), who haven't seen each other for fifteen years, meet at a racetrack. They both immediately drop their jobs as an attendant and cleaner to rekindle their friendship and brawl over which one will have Violet (Binnie Barnes) for their girl. When visiting a clip joint called the Shoreleave Cafe with Violet, they meet the owner, Jim Blake (Paul Kelly). Blake was their former captain; he left the Corps under a cloud when he was blamed for a security breach. Blake is involved in espionage, arranging to buy the plans for a new amphibious vehicle. Jimmy and Harry are called back to active service as gunnery sergeants with the 6th Marines where they crash the spy ring. The fast-paced comedy uses the spy plot as merely an excuse for five musical numbers by Harry Revel and a variety of comedy sequences, such as barroom brawls over thrown garters, spies and policemen with speech impediments, and jeep, motorcycle and car chases.

RKO's Call Out the Marines had a troubled production history with different stars and technicians announced in trade papers of the time for the film. The United States Marine Corps, which had initially cooperated with the producers, was outraged over the completed film in December 1941 and ordered the film shelved as \\"bad for morale\\".

In 2015, Modern Healthcare magazine named him the most influential physician- executive in the United States. Prior to becoming UCSF's ninth chair of medicine, he served as chief of UCSF's Division of Hospital Medicine. He is generally regarded as the academic leader of the hospitalist movement. Hospitalists are internists and other physicians who specialize in the care of hospitalized patients. He and a colleague, Lee Goldman, are known for coining the term \\"hospitalist\\" in a 1996 New England Journal of Medicine article. He is a past president of the Society of Hospital Medicine and a past chair of the American Board of Internal Medicine. He is also a noted expert in the field of medical errors and patient safety. He edits the U.S. government's leading patient safety website, AHRQ Patient Safety Network; this site receives approximately 1.5 million visits each year. He has also written two books on safety, Internal Bleeding and Understanding Patient Safety. In 2004, he won the John M. Eisenberg award, the nation's top honor in patient safety. His book on healthcare technology, The Digital Doctor: Hope, Hype, and Harm at the Dawn of Medicine's Computer Age, was published by McGraw-Hill in 2015, and became a New York Times science bestseller.

The project was then dependent on the Oireachtas passing new legislation on gaming legislation to allow for the Casino to open. In September 2011, Minister for Justice Alan Shatter said the casino was \\"out\\" based on a decision made at Cabinet on 20 September.

YouTube commenters at times have jokingly declared one or the other of these songs as the unofficial \\"national anthem\\" for YouTube, particularly \\"Dreamscape\\", \\"Trinity\\", and \\"With a Spirit\\" due to those three being the most popular. Because the artists were alphabetically sorted, 009 Sound System songs were placed at the top of the AudioSwap list, leading them to be chosen by a majority of users.  Personal life  Perls is married to Los Angeles jewelry designer Sonia Boyajian. Perls is CEO of the Los Angeles software company Ezvid.

Geography  The town is located on the banks of the Georgina River in Central West Queensland, north west of the state capital, Brisbane and south west of the regional centre of Mount Isa. Urandangi is in the Channel Country. All watercourses in this area are part of the Lake Eyre drainage basin, and most will dry up before their water reaches Lake Eyre. The predominant land use is grazing on native vegetation. The Marmanya Aboriginal community is located in Urandangi.  History  Waluwarra (also known as Warluwarra, Walugara, and Walukara) is an Australian Aboriginal language of Western Queensland. Its traditional language region is the local government area of Shire of Boulia, including Walgra Station and Wolga, from Roxborough Downs north to Carandotta Station and Urandangi on the Georgina River, on Moonah Creek to Rochedale, south-east of Pituri Creek. An unnamed township was established 2 August 1883. On 12 December 1884, it was officially named Urandangi. The name is believed to be derived Aboriginal words, uranda-ngie, meaning much gidyea. The township was a centre for travellers and drovers where a stock route crossed the Georgina River. By 1920 Urandangi had a pub, two stores, post office, police station and a dance hall.  Facilities  Today, Urandangi's only major facility is the Urandangi Hotel or the \\"Dangi Pub\\".  Education  Urandangi State School opened on 11 April 1994. The school caters for students from Prep -Year 7. It is a very small school, with only 8 students enrolled in 2015. There are no secondary schools in Urandangi. The nearest secondary school is in Mount Isa but too far for a daily commute. The Spinifex State College in Mount Isa offers boarding facilities. Other boarding schools or distance education would be options.

The phone used the T-Mobile network, but was only available for purchase at Microsoft retail stores or directly from Dell. The launch of the phone suffered multiple setbacks, due to many technical and logistics issues, with poor communication between Dell and its customers. In March 2012, Dell stopped production of Venue Pro smartphones. Launch The phone was codenamed 'Lightning', and was leaked to the Internet on April 21, 2010. Despite being cited as a launch partner for Windows Phone headsets early in July, the phone was not widely on sale in the United States on the launch day, unlike phones from other launch partners, such as Samsung Focus and three other phones by HTC. On October 11, in an official statement, Dell announced the phone to be available in the U.S. in holiday season of 2010. On November 8, Windows Phone was launched, and a very limited quantity of Venue Pros were available for purchase only in the seven Microsoft stores in the U.S. However, some early adopters of the phone received defective phones with Wi-Fi issues, SIM card issues, faulty headphone jack, and batteries marked as \\"Engineering Sample\\". Despite Dell urging users to return the phones, no phones were available in stock for exchange, and phones were not reshipped on November 19 as claimed. After missing both the States-wide launch on November 8 and the online launch on November 15, Dell announced that they were \\"ramping up production\\" and intended to launch the phone on a bigger scale. On December 1, Dell reintroduced the phone and began taking orders. Customers were given a shipping date of December 15. However, a day before the estimated shipping date, customers were informed that the shipping date was pushed further until January 6, 2011, two months after its intended launch date, as the phones \\"were being reworked in the factories\\". This caused user uproar in many Windows Phone communities. On December 16, Dell issued a new notice to assure that orders received before December 14 would be shipped before Christmas with an overnight shipping upgrade and a free gift. However, the Estimated Delivery Date of the orders were not updated until a couple days later, causing confusion amongst anticipating customers. Several customers who ordered on a later date received phones before those who ordered earlier. The promised shipping upgrade was also not fulfilled for many customers. On February 3, 2011, Dell launched Venue Pro in India. The launch price of Dell Venue was Rs. 34,990. On September 23, 2011, Dell posted that the Dell Venue Pro will get the Mango update \\"later this fall\\" on the unlocked Cincinnati Bell and T-Mobile devices. Dell released the Venue Pro for the AT&T; network later that year. As of December 1, 2011 all Dell Venue Pros have been upgraded to Mango, including those shipped from the factory. As of March 8, 2012 Dell are discontinuing future production of the Dell Venue Pro and Venue smartphones -- This was announced internally to Dell staff on the 8th of March. Wi-Fi bug The first batch of Dell Venue Pro phones to be manufactured suffered a bug which prevented them from logging onto secure Wi-Fi networks. Dell urged users with buggy phones to return them to the place of purchase and receive replacement handsets. In addition, even after the full launch of the Venue Pro, there have been reports of WiFi crashing the phone while downloading or using the data connection in some way.

In the 1880s he abandoned republicanism for socialism, and became Italy's leading theoretical writer on the issue for a time.Seton- Watson, Italy from liberalism to fascism, p. 155 He has been called the father of Sicilian socialism.Seton-Watson, Italy from liberalism to fascism, p. 161 Due to the Socialist party's discourse of Marxist class struggle, he reverted in 1894 to his original republicanism. Colajanni was an ardent critic of the Lombrosian school in criminology. In 1890 he was elected in the national Italian Chamber of Deputies and was re-elected in all subsequent parliaments until his death in September 1921. Redshirt Colajanni was born in Castrogiovanni (now Enna) in Sicily in a family of intense patriotic feelings. His father Luigi Colajanni and mother Concetta Falautano were small entrepreneurs in the sulfur industry. Colajanni, Napoleone, Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 26 (1982) At a young age he was inspired by Giuseppe Garibaldi and attempted to join the Redshirts in the Expedition of the Thousand for the unification of Italy in 1860 escaping to Palermo at the age of 13, but without success. A relative recognised the young boy and brought him back home. Two years later, in 1862, when Garibaldi passed by Castrogiovanni in his Expedition against Rome, Colajanni joined the troops. He reached the Aspromonte, where he was captured by government troops and deported to the island of Palmaria. Il re della mafia, by Marcello Donativi, in Nel regno della mafia, pp. 9-10 Liberated after an amnesty he returned to Sicily but volunteered again with Garibaldi's troops in the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866 and participated in the Battle of Bezzecca in Trentino, northern Italy, in July 1866. After the war, he finished school and started to study medicine in Genoa. He made contact with the Republicans of Mazzini and started to write for Il Dovere (The Duty). In 1867 he returned to Castrogiovanni due to the death of his father, but immediately left to join Garibaldi again in his new campaign to capture Rome. He arrived too late when the Battle of Mentana ‚Äì in which Garibaldi was defeated by Papal troops and a French auxiliary force ‚Äì had already ended. He took up his study in medicine again, this time in Naples. On February 26, 1869, he was arrested for taking part in a Republican conspiracy. He remained in prison until November 17, when an amnesty was declared because of the birth of the future king of Italy, Victor Emmanuel III of Italy. Towards positivist and evolutionary socialism After graduating in Medicine in 1871, he enrolled as a physician on a ship to South America before returning to Italy to devote himself to the study of sociology and continue his political activities. He returned to his home town, Castrogiovanni, where he practiced medicine and managed some sulfur mines owned by his mother. In 1875, Colajanni was among the participants at the Republican Congress in Rome to revive the movement. He started to collaborate with the magazine La rivista repubblicana of Arcangelo Ghisleri, which put him in contact with the exponents of republicanism and socialism in Milan. Through these democratic groups Colajanni came into contact with the positivist theories, and personalities such as Filippo Turati and Leonida Bissolati. Colajanni became one of the protagonists of the Italian positivist and evolutionary socialism, inspired by Darwinian evolution. With his book Il socialismo, published in 1884 in Catania, he became one of the first theoreticians of the Italian workers movement. His socialism was not based on the scientific Marxist approach, but was closer to the ideology of Mazzini ‚Äì one of the fathers of Italian unification ‚Äì with some influence of French utopian thinkers such as Georges Sorel, and in terms of practical politics resulted in a kind of radical-democratic reformism. In 1892 he was appointed Professor of Statistics at the University of Palermo. Since 1896 he directed the Rivista popolare, by means of which he strove to improve the moral and intellectual standard of the masses and combated all forms of intolerance and hypocrisy. Criminal sociology Napoleone Colajanni in his study He published many books and essays on social and political problems, and exposed the unscientific theories of Cesare Lombroso and his Scuola positiva (Positive school)See for instance: Homicide and the Italians, by Napoleone Colajanni, The New York Times, March 24, 1901 and Enrico Ferri on criminology. Colajanni was particularly critical of Lombroso's biological determinism ‚Äì in particular the alleged inferiority of southern Italians ‚Äì and he put a much greater emphasis on social conditions as a cause of offending. Lombroso and his disciples, however, remained dominant in Italy.Emsley, Crime, police, and penal policy, p. 191 Colajanni was the first to publish a book with criminal sociology in the title.Hurwitz & Christiansen, Criminology, p. 28 He belonged to the Terza scuola (Third School) and argued that in order to curtail the level of crime in a society there should be a certain level of security with regard to sustainable living conditions, economic stability and a more equal welfare distribution.Van Swaaningen, Critical Criminology, p. 37 After the publication of his two-volume study La sociologia criminale in 1889, in which he emphasized the social factors on criminal behaviour, he was virulently attacked by Lombroso and his disciples. The work received a moderately positive response from the scientific community both in Italy and abroad. Lombroso, however, did not allow any criticism by rival scientists and his alleged scientific supremacy. He unleashed a smear campaign and scientific crusade against Colajanni while blocking access to academic journals to prevent Colajanni's replies.Hiller, Bodies that tell, pp. 36-41 In his essay Per la razza maledetta (For the cursed race, published in 1898) Colajanni ridiculed the anthropometrical categories of the Lombrosian school and deconstructed their cultural stereotypes. He argued that the high rates of criminality in Southern Italy ‚Äì the so-called evidence of Southern racial inferiority ‚Äì could simply be explained by social conditions and levels of education. He opposed the notion of racial superiority as an ideological tool to legitimise dominance and exploitation, which would lead to the destruction of other races instead of its alleged progressive transformation. In a later work, Latini e anglo-sassoni: Razze superiori e razze inferiori (Latins and Anglo-Saxons. Inferior and superior races, published in 1903), he expanded his critique on the concept of superior and inferior civilisations to the Anglo- Saxon nations.Huysseune, Modernity and Secession, p. 52 Political activities In 1879 Colajanni had been appointed as a municipal councillor in Castrogiovanni. In 1882 he was a candidate in the general election in the constituency of Caltanissetta, and while not elected he obtained a significant following. Although poor health forced him to stay at Castrogiovanni, he continued to write political articles in periodicals of democratic orientation. In 1890 he was elected in the national Italian Chamber of Deputies in the district of Caltanissetta for the first time. He was re- elected in all subsequent parliaments until his death in September 1921. Napoleone Colajanni, Camera dei diputati, portale storico In Parliament he sat as a Republican and showed socialist tendencies, becoming one of the de facto leaders of the Republicans in Parliament. He sponsored initiatives such as the parliamentary inquiry on Eritrea (1891) and the Banca Romana scandal (1892). He argued against the incipient colonial policy of the moderate Left. Anti- colonialism was one of his favourite themes. In his book Politica coloniale (Colonial policy), written in 1891, Colajanni rejected the colonial adventure in Eritrea. The poor agricultural conditions made the country inappropriate for impoverished southern Italian populace and completely inadequate to serve as a market for the emerging Italian industry. Colajanni played an important role in the Banca Romana scandal. A suppressed report about the sorry financial state of the bank was leaked to Colajanni, who divulged its contents to parliament. On December 20, 1892, Colajanni read out long extracts in Parliament and Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti was forced to appoint an expert commission to investigate the bank.Seton-Watson, Italy from liberalism to fascism, p. 154 The resulting inquiry caused the fall of the government of Giolitti in November 1893.Cabinet Forced To Resign; Italian Ministers Called \\"Thieves\\" by the People, The New York Times, November 25, 1893 Fasci Siciliani Though never a member of the Socialist Party, Colajanni was Sicily's leading political radical. He supported the Fasci Siciliani a popular movement of democratic and socialist inspiration, which arose in Sicily in the years between 1891 and 1893. The demands of the movement were fair land rents, higher wages, lower local taxes and distribution of misappropriated common land.Seton-Watson, Italy from liberalism to fascism, pp. 162-63 He took the Fasci under his political protection, defending them in parliament and in the press.Fentress, Rebels & Mafiosi, pp. 227-228 Francesco Crispi, who took over after the fall of Giolitti in December 1893, promised important measures of land reform for the near future. Crispi was not blind to the misery and the need for social reform. Before 1891 he had been the patron of the Sicilian working-class and many of their associations had been named after him. Crispi's good intentions were soon drowned in the clamour for strong measures. In the three weeks of uncertainty before the government was formed, the rapid spread of violence drove many local authorities to disregard Giolitti's ban on the use of firearms. In December 1893 many peasants lost their lives in clashes with the police and army.Seton-Watson, Italy from liberalism to fascism, pp. 165-67 In order to stem the turmoil, Crispi offered Colajanni the Ministry of Agriculture, which he refused. When riots on the island got out of hand, Crispi asked Colajanni to undertake a mission of appeasement on Sicily. On January 3, 1894, only four days after Crispi had promised Colajanni there would be no state of siege, martial law was declared in the island. General Roberto Morra di Lavriano was dispatched with 40,000 troops to restore order. Colajanni condemned the Fasci leaders for lacking to keep the peace.Sicily in a State of Siege; The Tax Agitation Has Been Practically Suppressed, The New York Times, January 9, 1894 After conferring with general Morra he issued a manifesto in which he urged the people to restore order. He argued that the government was engaged in bettering the working conditions and deserved their confidence, at least for a while. People breaking the peace he called fools and traitors.More Troops For Sicily, The New York Times, January 7, 1894 Within a few days of the declaration of martial law and the violent suppression of the Fasci, Colajanni broke with Crispi and wrote the book Gli avvenimenti di Sicilia e le loro cause on the events in Sicily, which put the main blame on Crispi. The disorders were not the product of a revolutionary plot, but Crispi chose to believe otherwise. On the basis of dubious documents and reports, Crispi claimed that there was an organised conspiracy to separate Sicily from Italy; the leaders of the Fasci conspired with the clerics and were financed by French gold, and war and invasion were looming. Disillusioned by the spread of violence in Sicily, to which he believed the Socialist party's discourse of class struggle had contributed, Colajanni reverted in 1894 to his original republicanism. On April 12, 1895, he took part in the founding congress of the Italian Republican Party (Partito Repubblicano Italiano). Napoleone Colajanni, biografie dei protagonisti Repubblicani Against the Mafia A recurring theme of his political engagement was the struggle to overcome the economic contrast between North and South of Italy, through a reform of society, but also of the state through federalism. His contribution the socio-political definition of the Southern question was substantial, in particular with the volumes Settentrionali e meridionali (Northern and southern, published in 1898) and Nel regno della mafia (In the realm of the Mafia, published in 1900). Colajanni identified the root of the backwardness of Sicily in power groups of landowners of the rural estates and the Mafia, which were closely connected to each other and in a close relationship with public administration on the island. This connection was well established had become normal practice from 1876 onwards. The only hope to change the situation lay in an autonomist-federalist reform of the state. In 1900, Colajanni wrote a j‚Äôaccuse directed at the magistracy, the police, and the government in relation to the trial about the 1893 murder of Emanuele Notarbartolo, the ex-mayor of Palermo and ex-governor of the Bank of Sicily. Notarbartolo had been killed on the instruction of Raffaele Palizzolo, a member of parliament and a director of the Bank of Sicily, in revenge for exposing a swindle using the bank's money. Palizzolo was allegedly involved with the Sicilian Mafia.Fentress, Rebels & Mafiosi, p. 246 The Italian government, Colajanni wrote, has done everything to consolidate the Mafia and render it omnipotent. ‚ÄúTo fight and destroy the reign of the Mafia, it is necessary that the Italian government ceases to be the king of the Mafia,‚Äù he said in his book Nel regno della mafia. The government, he said, needed to clean up Sicily and institute a fair and practical administration. Anti- Marxism Colajanni continued to reject the ideological underpinnings of classical Marxism, which he considered to be a contradiction to democracy. He remained a social-Darwinist throughout his life, convinced that socialism would be a product of a natural process of evolution and social selection.Gregor, Young Mussolini and the intellectual origins of fascism, p. 13 He did not consider himself a materialist: the social question was not only an economic issue but also an ethical one. He rejected the concept of class struggle. He did not deny that there was a struggle, but he saw it as the first stage of evolution, which was not be encouraged, but passed in favour of a greater spread of altruism. A position that proved irreconcilable with Marxism, which led him to adhere to the newborn Republican Party. He also opposed revolutionary syndicalism and severely criticized the general strike of 1904. He opposed the Italian invasion of Libya in 1912, but at the outbreak of the First World War, despite his anti-militarist ideas, he became an ardent supporter of the interventionist camp on the side of the Triple Entente. He launched a vigorous campaign against Avanti, the organ of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), when Benito Mussolini was removed as chief editor, and openly criticized the PSI for what he considered Bolshevik sympathies. He strongly opposed the communists that had left the socialist party in January 1921, and felt certain sympathy for fascism in its initial phase. Like many other intellectuals and politicians of all persuasions, he saw fascism as an extreme defence against the dangers of Bolshevism, but condemned its recourse to violence. In August 1921 he applauded the agreement between socialists and fascists to put an end to the civil war. His death on 2 September 1921, saved him from, with the benefit of hindsight, an embarrassing adhesion of fascism. Main books * Il socialismo e sociologia criminale.

As an attacking midfielder or forward she represented England at full international level. Broadhurst also played for leading English clubs Doncaster Belles, Arsenal and Croydon/Charlton Athletic. Playing career =Club career= Broadhurst began playing for Sheffield FC Ladies, coached by her father Brian, at age 12. She moved to Doncaster Belles at 18 after studying Leisure and Recreation at college and spending a summer working for Pontin's. While playing for the all-conquering Belles, Broadhurst worked as a forklift truck driver for Royal Doulton in Stoke. As a playmaker, Broadhurst was a key component of the side which wrested the League title back from Arsenal and completed a domestic double in 1994. Belles manager Paul Edmunds said of Broadhurst \\"the more she gets the ball, the better we play.\\" In 1995 Broadhurst moved to Arsenal and was given a job in the club's mail order department. In summer 1996 she underwent surgery on a knee injury, but finished the season as top goalscorer. By 1997-98 Broadhurst was playing for Croydon, scoring the opening goal in a 3-2 defeat to Arsenal in that season's FA Women's Cup final. Croydon won a League and Cup double in 2000, clinched when they beat Aston Villa 6-0 to win the league. Broadhurst scored twice in that game. When Croydon came under the auspices of Charlton Athletic, Broadhurst returned to Doncaster Belles. However, she was back with Charlton in 2001-02. From 2003-2005 Broadhurst featured in three successive FA Women's Cup finals with Charlton. She played in a 3-0 loss to the professionals of Fulham in May 2003, then in another defeat--again 3-0--to former club Arsenal the following year. In 2005 Broadhurst was on the winning side as Charlton beat Everton 1-0 at Upton Park. It was Broadhurst's eleventh appearance in the domestic women's game's showpiece event. Broadhurst retired after hitting the winning goal as Charlton reserves beat Millwall Lionesses 3-2 in the 2006 Kent County Cup final. =International career= Broadhurst made her England debut aged 16. Manager Martin Reagan called-up Broadhurst for the Mundialito tournament in August 1984 and handed her a first cap against hosts Italy. Along with Kirsty Pealling, Broadhurst was controversially dropped from the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup squad, with manager Ted Copeland saying \\"They are not international footballers at this level.\\" Copeland had first excluded Broadhurst in August 1994 after taking exception to an interview Broadhurst and Mandy Lowe gave to The Guardian. \\"He only picks boring bastards, he doesn't like personality. So what can I do?\\" was Broadhurst's response. Broadhurst was later recalled by Copeland and scored a hat-trick against Scotland in March 1997. Coaching career In 2012 Broadhurst joined Liverpool Ladies as an assistant coach.

In British culture, the phrase is used to criticise public-facing organisations and customer service staff who rely on information stored on or generated by a computer to make decisions and respond to customers' requests, often in a manner which goes against common sense. It may also refer to a deliberately unhelpful attitude towards customers and service-users commonly experienced within British society, whereby more could be done to reach a mutually satisfactory outcome, but is not.  Little Britain  In Little Britain, \\"Computer says no\\" is the catchphrase of Carol Beer (played by David Walliams), a bank worker and later holiday rep and hospital receptionist, who always responds to a customer's enquiry by typing it into her computer and responding with \\"Computer says no\\" to even the most reasonable of requests. When asked to do something aside from asking the computer, she would shrug and remain obstinate in her unhelpfulness, and ultimately cough in the customer's face. The phrase was also used in the Australian soap opera Neighbours in 2006 as a reference to Little Britain. The catchphrase returns in Little Brexit, where Carol is still working at Sunsearchers as a holiday rep, confronted by a woman wanting to go to Europe. Carol uses the paraphrase \\"Brexit Says No\\", when the woman wants to go to France, Spain and Italy. Usage The \\"Computer says no\\" attitude often comes from larger companies that rely on information stored electronically. When this information is not updated, it can often lead to refusals of financial products or incorrect information being sent out to customers. These situations can often be resolved by an employee updating the information; however, when this cannot be done easily, the \\"Computer says no\\" attitude can be viewed as becoming prevalent when there is unhelpfulness as a result. This attitude can also occur when an employee fails to read human emotion in the customer and reacts according to his or her professional training or relies upon a script. This attitude also crops up when larger companies rely on computer credit scores and do not meet with a customer to discuss his or her individual needs, instead basing a decision upon information stored in computers. Some organisations attempt to offset this attitude by moving away from reliance on electronic information and using a human approach towards requests. \\"Computer says no\\" happens in a more literal sense when computer systems employ filters that prevent messages being passed along, as when these messages are perceived to include obscenities. When information is not passed through to the person operating the computer, decisions may be made without seeing the whole picture.

Together with his long-time business partner Alan Morris, he formed the Australian advertising agency Mojo which enjoyed much Australian and some international success in the 1980s and whose name survived until 2016 as Publicis Mojo, the Australian subsidiary of the French multinational advertising and communications company holding Publicis Groupe. Career Born in Adelaide Johnston started out as a copywriter in that city before taking a job as an assistant producer in an Adelaide ad agency, then moving into the copy department writing jingles. He relocated to Sydney in 1968, joining an agency called Marketing and Advertising, later to be known as Hertz Walpole Advertising. In the mid 1970s he was teamed with freelance writer Alan Morris and together they had immediate success as a team working on campaigns for Hertz Walpole's clients Meadow Lea margarine (\\"You oughta be congratulated\\") and Tooheys beer (\\"How do you feel?\\"). In 1973 they left the agency and in 1975 started their own consultancy and continuing to work on such accounts as they grew their business. In 1979 their creative consultancy became the full-service ad agency Mojo and Meadow Lea and Tooheys amongst other clients, signed with the new shop. During the 1970s and 1980s Mojo was the hottest creative agency in Sydney and Mo and Jo had success jointly authoring World Series Cricket's \\"C'mon Aussie C'mon \\". and later the Australian Tourism Commission's spot with Paul Hogan's instruction to put another \\"Shrimp on the barbie. The Mojo approach to TV advertisements used a colloquial and irreverent style, often with a catchy jingle to simple accompaniment and frequently sung in Jo's own \\"gravelly\\" voice. Contrasting against the clipped and British-imitating style of voice presenters on Australian TV up till that point, Mojo ads highlighted Australian idiom and its laconic accent. Ads such as ‚ÄúI‚Äôm as Australian as Ampol‚Äù, ‚ÄúHit ‚Äòem with the Old Pea Beau‚Äù (insectide), ‚ÄúEverybody loves Speedo‚Äù, ‚ÄúI Can Feel a Fourex Coming on‚Äù, ‚ÄúEvery Amco tells a Story‚Äù (for Amco jeans) all came out of the Mojo agency in the 1980s. The use of Peter Allen's I Still Call Australia Home to promote Qantas was developed at Mojo in the late 1980s and until 2011 this campaign concept was still used by Qantas and its ad agencies. In August 1987 Mojo was acquired by the Melbourne-based publicly listed agency Monaghan Dayman Adams Limited and became MojoMDA. The resultant merged business maintained its listed status until 1989. The Mojo MDA Group had offices in London, New York, San Francisco, Hong Kong, Singapore and affiliates throughout Asia. In 1988 Advertising Age named it as International Agency of the Year. In August 1989 the Mojo MDA Group was Australia's largest ad agency with billings of $180million and was acquired by the Los Angeles agency Chiat\\\\Day. The merger was unsuccessful and in 1992 Chiat/Day sold off Mojo to Foote, Cone & Belding.Answers.com - TBWA/Chiat/Day - company history In later international dealings which saw FCB acquired by the Interpublic Group, the Australian Mojo offices were sold to Publicis. In 1994 Jo left the employment of the Australian Mojo business and returned to Hertz Walpole as an Executive Creative Director, taking up a shareholding. When Alan Morris finished up a stint at Singleton Ogilvy & Mather in 1999, he took up the opportunity to re- unite with Jo and Jim Walpole and their agency was renamed \\"Morris Johnston Walpole\\".

A co-production of the United Kingdom and Ireland, the film stars Richard Coyle, Ruth Bradley, Bronagh Gallagher and Russell Tovey among an ensemble cast of Irish actors. Alt URL Grabbers premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2012, and received mostly positive reviews upon release. Plot Garda Ciar√°n O'Shea (Richard Coyle), an alcoholic, initially resents his new partner, Garda Lisa Nolan (Ruth Bradley), a workaholic seeking to impress her superiors by volunteering for temporary duty in a remote Irish island. After discovering mutilated whale corpses, the quiet community slowly comes to realise that they're under attack by bloodsucking tentacled aliens of various sizes that came from a ball of green light that fell from the sky, dubbing them \\"Grabbers\\". When Paddy (Lalor Roddy), the town drunk, inexplicably survives an attack, the local marine ecologist, Dr. Smith (Russell Tovey), theorizes that his high blood alcohol content proved toxic to the Grabbers, who survive on blood and water. O'Shea contacts the mainland, but an oncoming storm prevents any escape or help. The group also realizes the rain will allow the remaining large male Grabber to move about the island freely. Seeking to keep calm in the town, Nolan and O'Shea organize a party at the local pub, intending to keep the island's residents safe but unaware of the danger. Initially hesitant to join in a celebration when no good reason can be offered, the people enthusiastically agree when Brian Maher (David Pearse), the pub owner, offers free drinks. O'Shea volunteers to stay sober so that he can coordinate the town's defenses, and everyone else becomes drunk. In a drunken stupor, Nolan reveals that she has come to the island to escape the shadow of her more-favoured sister. When they are alone in a squad car, Nolan confesses to O'Shea that she has feelings for him despite turning down his advances earlier. Smith wanders outside the pub and tries to get a picture of the beast, reasoning that his inebriated state will protect him from being eaten. Instead, the monster throws him into the air and kills him. Nolan and O'Shea escape to the pub, where they try to protect the townspeople. Nolan drunkenly reveals the danger they are in while trying to reassure everyone that nothing is trying to kill them. Panicked, they retreat to the second level of the pub, and baby grabbers take over the first floor. Nolan accidentally sets the pub on fire while trying to sneak out, but she and O'Shea manage to draw the attention of the adult. O'Shea and Nolan drive to a construction site, and the monster follows them. There, they hope to strand the monster on dry land, as it needs water to survive. Before they can successfully set a trap, the monster arrives and attacks O'Shea. Although wounded, he survives the attack, and Nolan uses the heavy construction equipment to mount a counter-attack, pinning it at the base of a pit. The monster grabs O'Shea, but before it can eat him he dumps a bottle of Paddy's poit√≠n into its mouth, sickening it and causing it to release him. Nolan then ignites nearby explosives with a flare gun, killing the Grabber. As the storm clears up, O'Shea throws away his flask, and they return to town. Unknown to anyone, more Grabber eggs are buried on the beach, and they are about to hatch.

She became famous for Celia, lo que dice (\\"What Celia Says\\") the first in the series of children's novels which were a collection of short stories first published in magazines in 1929. The series were both popular and successful during the time of their publications and are today considered classics of Spanish literature. Life She was the daughter of Leocadio Aragoneses, a yeoman of the Spanish Royal Guard from Segovia and her mother was Basque. Born in Madrid she spent her summers with her grandfather, Isidro, in Abades, a small village west of Segovia. She studied Philosophy in Madrid. In 1908 she married her cousin, Eusebio de Gorbea y Lemmi, a military man, intellectual and writer. They had two sons, the youngest, Bol√≠n, died in 1920 at the age of 10 and she sunk into a deep depression at times trying to contact her son through a Ouija board. Her younger son, who had lost an eye in a hunting accident, eventually married Ana Mar√≠a Link, a young Swiss student who was studying at the Residencia de Se√±oritas in Madrid. Encarna lived mainly in Madrid but also spent time in Tenerife in the Canary Islands, San Roque, Zaragoza, Barcelona, Valencia, France and Argentina. Her husband, Gorbea, a playwright, was a member of the Generation of 1914 and introduced Encarnaci√≥n to his circle of writers and artists. By the late 1920s she had decided to write and began writing for children in 1928 for the magazine Blanco y Negro under the pseudonym Elena Fort√∫n,Abades City Council a name of one of her husband's characters. Her stories became so popular that the publishing house of Aguilar became interested and began putting them into print in 1935. Set in Madrid, these stories were told from the perspective of seven-year-old Celia G√°lvez de Montalb√°n, a young girl who questions adults and the world around her in ways that were both ingenuous and innocent. She especially queried the educational system that sought to dampen the imaginations of young girls. Patricia Jorge Rubio, The magic works of Elena Fort√∫n: the revolutionary tales of young Celia, RTVE.ES, April 16, 2002.Encarna knew how to excite the hearts, minds and dreams of children and these stories became favorites with Spanish girls during the 1930s through the 1960s. Spanish Civil War Although a member of the Lyceum Women's Club, Encarna Aragoneses was not engaged in any political activity, however she believed that the Second Spanish Republic would end illiteracy and bring equality into women's lives. At the start of the Spanish Civil War she stayed in Madrid with her husband who was loyal to the Republic. In Celia en la revoluci√≥n (1987), an accurate portrayal of Republican Spain during the siege of Madrid, the author wonders who is right and expresses her own thoughts and sufferings of the war through Celia who is horrified at the uncompromising positions of both sides. P√âREZ, Janet & IHRIE, Maureen The Feminist Encyclopedia of Spanish Literature , Greenwood Publishing Group (2002), pp. 243 In 1938 she became a member of the Comisi√≥n del Teatro de los Ni√±os and in July her play Mo√±itos (Baubles) was staged. Exile Later that year she and her husband went to Paris and then into exile in Argentina with help from her daughter-in-law's family. In Buenos Aires she met the writer Jorge Luis Borges at the National Public Library where they were both working. Unlike other writers who left Spain because of the war, her Celia books continued to be published despite the fact that Celia, like Encarna and her husband, was a Republican with no specific party affiliation. In 1948 she returned to Spain to negotiate the possibility of an amnesty for her husband. She was not persecuted because she did not belong to a political party, her only crime was being a woman who felt that the Republic would enhance the education and role of women in society. She visited with her old friends from the \\"defunct\\" Lyceum Women's Club which was continuing its activities in an unofficial and clandestine way. A few months later her husband, who was still in Buenos Aires, committed suicide. P√âREZ, Janet & IHRIE, Maureen The Feminist Encyclopedia of Spanish Literature , Greenwood Publishing Group (2002), pp. 244-245 Grief-stricken she went to America to live with her son who was in exile. Later she returned to Madrid and died on 8 May 1952 at age 65. In 1957, a few years after her death, Mar√≠a Martos de Baeza and playwright Matilde Ras sponsored a fund raising effort to erect a monument in her honor in the Parque del Oeste in Madrid. The relief which shows Elena Fort√∫n between two children was designed by the Murcian sculptor Jos√© Planes. In C√≥rdoba there are the beautiful Jardines Escritora Elena Fort√∫n named in her honor; as well as the streets, Calle Elena Fort√∫n in Madrid, Las Rozas de Madrid, Valdetorres de Jarama and, in M√°laga, the Calle Escritora Elena Fort√∫n. In 1993 Celia, lo que dice, Celia novelista and Celia en el colegio were adapted into a series of six episodes for Spanish television and directed by Jos√© Luis Borau. In November 2019, her book Celia en la revoluci√≥n was adapted by Alba Quintas into a theater play, directed by Mar√≠a Folguera. It premiered at the Valle- Incl√°n Theater of the Spanish National Drama Center Roc√≠o Garcia, El Pa√≠s, October 31, 2019 Javier Vallejo, El Pa√≠s, November 16, 2019.

Description and history The Sargent house consists of a 1-1/2 story main block, three bays wide, with a long ell. The main block is oriented to the southwest, with its centered entry framed by sidelight windows and pilasters, and topped by a simple entablature. The flanking windows are replacement sash windows, as are those on the other elevations. The house is finished in clapboards, completely obscuring the log structure. The logs are roughly hewn, with limestone mortar filling the gaps. In places where the log beams are too short, two logs were simply butted together. The corners are formed by the use of square corner notches. The logs show evidence of having been covered in sheathing from an early period. The house's ell has more traditional frame construction, and was probably built during the Greek Revival period, around the same time the front door surround was added. Its interior consists of three rooms. The interior of the main block has a central hall with large chambers on either side. The western chamber has a narrow staircase leading upstairs, where there are four small chambers accessed off a narrow hallway. The house is thought to have been built by Levi Sargent (1786-1861), a Methodist minister who moved to the area in the 1790s and married in 1811. That same year he purchased the land on which this house sits (then ).

His main task as minister was to produce a Bill on local government rating but this proved highly controversial and the issue was a magnet for a whole range of problems associated with housing, including the failure of the government to increase the number of houses being built, to be raised at Mitcham and elsewhere, including to Johnstone‚Äôs advantage at Willesden.The Times, 22 February 1923, p7The Times, 26 February 1923, p15The Times, 28 February 1923, p12 It was reported that the loss of the by-election would represent a blow for the Unionist government, although it was too early after the general election to see the results as a definitive verdict on Bonar Law‚Äôs administration.The Times,3 March 1923, p11 Result The result was a gain for the Liberal Party from the Unionists with Johnstone gaining 60% of the poll and a majority of 5,176 over Stanley. The Liberal victory was described by Austen Chamberlain as a ‚Äúsmash‚Äù and a bad omen for the by-election at Mitcham being held on the same day, The Austen Chamberlain Diary Letters: The correspondence of Sir Austen Chamberlain; Royal Historical Society, Cambridge University Press, 1995 p221 which the Unionists also lost, this time to Labour. Clearly the absence of a Labour candidate at Willesden meant the Liberals were able to present Johnstone as the only progressive and anti-Tory candidate.The Times, 3 March 1923, p10 This tactical advantage was underscored by an unproved allegation against Stanley that he or his supporters had tried to bribe a Labour man into standing as a candidate for the purpose of splitting the Liberal vote.The Times, 1 March 1923, p12 The loss of Willesden by such a large majority was unexpected The Times, 5 March 1923, p12 Aftermath It was hard to discern Willesden as part of any pattern of political success for the Liberal Party. Cook and Ramsden in their survey of British by-elections comment that none of the by-elections in the 1922-1923 Parliament pointed to the outcome of Stanley Baldwin‚Äôs Tariff reform general election of 6 December 1923.Chris Cook & John Ramsden, By-elections in British politics; UCL Press, 1997 p40 At that election, Johnstone narrowly held the seat despite the intervention of a Labour party candidate.

It consists of four amino acid residues; aspartate, cysteine, glutamate, and glycine, bonded with four (Cr3+) centers. It interacts with the insulin receptor, by prolonging kinase activity through stimulating the tyrosine kinase pathway, thus leading to improved glucose absorption. and has been confused with glucose tolerance factor. The exact mechanisms underlying this process are currently unknown. Evidence for the existence of this protein comes from the fact that the removal of 51Cr in the blood exceeds the rate of 51Cr formation in the urine. This indicates that the transport of Cr3+ must involve an intermediate (i.e. chromodulin) and that Cr3+ is moved from the blood to tissues in response to increased levels of insulin. Subsequent protein isolations in rats, dogs, mice and cows have shown the presence of a similar substance, suggesting that it is found extensively in mammals. This oligopeptide is small, having a molecular weight of around 1 500 g/mol and the predominant amino acids present are glutamic acid, glycine, and cysteine. Despite recent efforts to characterize the exact structure of chromodulin, it is still relatively unknown. Nature of binding From spectroscopic data, it has been shown that Cr3+ binds tightly to chromodulin (Kf = 1021 M‚àí4), and that the binding is highly cooperative (Hill Coefficient = 3.47). It has been shown that holochromodulin binds 4 equivalents of Cr3+. Evidence for this comes from in vitro studies which showed that apochromodulin exerts its maximal activity on insulin receptors when titrated with 4 equivalents of Cr3+. Chromodulin is highly specific for Cr3+ as no other metals are able to stimulate tyrosine kinase activity. It is believed to stimulate the phosphorylation of the 3 tyrosine residues of the Œ≤ subunits of the insulin receptor. From electronic studies, the crystal field stabilization energy was determined to be 1.74 x 103 while the Racah parameter B was 847 cm‚àí1. This indicates that chromium binds to chromodulin in the trivalent form. In addition, magnetic susceptibility studies have shown that chromium does not coordinate to any N-terminal amine groups but rather to carboxylates (although the exact the amino acids involved are still unknown). These magnetic susceptibility studies are consistent with the presence of a mononuclear Cr3+ center and an unsymmetric trinuclear Cr3+ assembly with bridging oxo ligands. In chromodulin isolated from bovine liver, x-ray absorption spectroscopy studies have shown that the chromium (III) atoms are surrounded by 6 oxygen atoms with an average Cr‚ÄîO distance of 1.98 √Ö, while the distance between 2 chromium (III) atoms is 2.79 √Ö. These results are indicative of a multinuclear assembly. No sulfur ligands coordinate to chromium and instead, it has been proposed that a disulfide linkage between 2 cysteine residues occurs owing to a characteristic peak at 260 nm.

Character The Colonel acts as a \\"straight man\\" comic foil to the show's absurd characters and sketches. He maintains a rigidly mirthless personality and is always dressed in olive green British Army uniform. He occasionally makes appearances in the show, usually breaking the fourth wall and disrupting sketches to pronounce them too silly for the public and, therefore, demanding that something else be shown. He often orders the show to proceed in a different direction (sometimes to the unshown director) and frequently makes offhanded insults to men with long hair. The Colonel's role in stopping or redirecting sketches has been discussed as an example of a character breaking the fourth wall of theatrical production, challenging the \\"fictional credibility\\" of the presentation, and has been compared to the work of Luigi Pirandello. Main appearances The Colonel appeared first in the pilot episode, \\"Whither Canada?\\" in a documentary-formatted sketch, to help describe the Allied Forces involvement in joke warfare during World War II. He appears four times in \\"Owl-Stretching Time\\", protesting rip offs of the British army's slogan, \\"It's a Man's Life in the Modern Army.\\" The Colonel appears most frequently in \\"Full Frontal Nudity\\". In this episode, the Colonel is writing in his office when he is suddenly approached by Private Watkins (played by Eric Idle), a young soldier who has been in the army for one day, claiming he wants to leave as it's dangerous and people get killed. They're interrupted by the entrance of two gangsters, Dino and Luigi Vercotti, who attempt an outrageously obvious protection racket, hoping to extort money from the Colonel in exchange for agreeing to protect his army. After a brief dialogue between the gangsters and the humourless Colonel, the latter stands up, exclaiming that the whole premise is too silly. He addresses the unseen director of the sketch and begins to take over the show. He claims that he has not been given a single funny line and demands to have the camera zoom in on his face. Looking straight into the camera, the Colonel orders that the show proceed to an animated segment, which it does. Later on, the Colonel again stops the episode to announce \\"Now, I‚Äôve noticed a tendency for this programme to get rather silly\\". After a brief speech of condemnation, he lets the show move on to an outdoor hermit sketch. He then interrupts this sketch in the middle of a scene, forcing the actors and, in fact, the entire filming crew to desert the set. Afterwards, he later interrupts the famous Dead Parrot sketch, when after Mr Praline calls the situation too silly, the Colonel bursts in on the scene, expressing his agreement and demanding that the show \\"Get on with it!‚Äù The Colonel lastly appears in this episode during the documentary sketch about \\"Hell‚Äôs Grannies\\", when a vicar (Eric Idle) is attacked by a vicious gang of keep-left signs. The Colonel effectively ends the episode, by staring straight into the camera and saying \\"Now for a complete change of mood\\". Other appearances The Colonel has made appearances in Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl, at Pink Floyd's 1975 concert at Knebworth UK, and in a May 1982 episode of Saturday Night Live in which the character is used to comment on NBC's earlier refusal to air a commercial (featuring Chapman as the Colonel) for the Amnesty International benefit The Secret Policeman's Other Ball. Archive footage of the Colonel was used in Monty Python Live (Mostly) for 2014. The surviving members of Monty Python sent a \\"boot-shaped floral arrangement\\" to Graham Chapman's funeral, which included the phrase \\"stop us if we're all getting too silly\\", in recognition of his role as The Colonel.

The surviving structure dates from 12th to 15th centuries Wynebald de Ballon (variously spelt Baalun, Baalan, Balun, Balodun, Balon etc.),The name is usually modernised to conform with the modern French cartographic spelling of Ballon, Sarthe. The first name is spelled variously as Guinebaud, Winebald, Winebold, Winebaud, etc. (c.1058‚Äìc.1126), was an early Norman magnate. He appeared in England during the reign of William Rufus, along with his brother, Hamelin de Ballon, later created 1st Baron of Abergavenny.Traditional accounts give them another brother, Wynoc de Ballon, about whom little is recorded.  Origin  Wynebald was born in France, probably as his brother Hamelin was known to have been,Hamelin is described as \\"de Castello Baladone natus\\" (born in the castle of Ballon) in a charter (no. 1045) dated between 1087 and 1100, by which he gives the Chapel of Bergavenny to St. Vincent's Abbey, Le Mans (Round, J. Horace (ed.) Calendar of Documents Preserved in France, Vol. I: A.D. 918‚Äì1206 (1899), \\"Maine\\" pp.359-371) in the ancient castle of Ballon, 12 miles north of Le Mans, capital of the ancient County of Maine. From its strength the castle was known as \\"The Gateway to Maine\\". Ballon is today a French commune, in the department of Sarthe (72), in the modern region of Pays-de-la-Loire. Maine was invaded and conquered by William Duke of Normandy in the early 1060s, just prior to his invasion of England.  Career  The Lower River Usk.

It was of the Cluniac order, held in much affection by the first Norman kings, as witnessed by William II (1087‚Äì1100) having donated his royal manor of Bermondsey, Surrey as its site. It was directly across the River Thames from the Tower of London, recently built by William I (1066‚Äì1087) as his principal seat. In 1092 Wynebald de Ballon, no doubt to please William II, made several donations of land to Bermondsey Abbey. These were:Bermondsey Annals Annales Monasterii de Bermundeseia Luard, H.R.

Turstin had been standard bearer to William the Conqueror at Hastings, according to Orderic Vitalis(b.1075) in his Ecclesiastical History, written between 1123 and 1141. William had asked successively 2 great nobles to fill the post of standard bearer for him, but both had declined, stating they had contingents of their own retainers to command; effectively they felt their valour would be better displayed taking an active part in the battle. William was therefore grateful for the acceptance of the humbler Turstin, who proved to be very courageous in his duty, and remained at all times by William's side. It was no doubt due to Turstin's loyal service that he was awarded by the Conqueror the several English manors which amounted to a significant fiefdom. It is not certain how or why the transfer of virtually Turstin's entire fiefdom in several English counties came to Wynebald. These lands included not only those Turstin had held in capite from the King, but also his mesne holdings where he held from a non-royal overlord. For some unstated reason commentators seem to rule out a marriage between Wynebald and a daughter of Turstin's as the causal agent behind the transfers. Turstin appears to have been banished and stripped of his land holdings for rebelling against William Rufus. =North Cadbury, Som.= In 1086, as shown in the Domesday Book, North Cadbury manor in Somerset was held by Turstin fitzRolf. It passed before 1092 to Wynebald, who was recorded as holding it in that year.Sanders, English Baronies, p.68 This appears to have been his principal manor. It passed via his daughter Mabilia to her husband Henry de Newmarch. =Dyrham, Glos.= The manor of Dyrham, Glos. passed to the Newmarch family from Wynebald de Ballon  Marriage and issue  By his wife Elizabeth he had two sons, Roger and Milo, and one daughter, Mabilia. Roger, the elder son, died in about 1126 having confirmed in the same year his father's grant to Gloucester Abbey. He had married Hawise de Gournay, by whom he had three sons, Roger, Hamelin and Arnold, all of whom died without issue before 1166. His daughter Mabilia, the wife of Henry Newmarch, therefore became his sole heiress. She confirmed her father's grant to Bermondsey.BL Harley 4757, f.7  Succession  He was succeeded in his estates by his son-in-law, Henry of Newmarch. Sources *Sanders, I. J.

While the ship has never been positively identified, there are two theories of its history. It may have been the Caledonia, built on the River Rouge near Detroit in 1799 and originally used in the fur trade in the early 19th century. It was commandeered by the British military at the outbreak of the War of 1812 and then captured by the Americans a year later. It was later sold to Pennsylvania merchants who renamed it the General Wayne and used it as part of the Underground Railroad to ferry runaway slaves to Canada until sinking sometime before 1850.

The organization merged with a student organization sponsored by the Communist Party, USA in 1935 to form the American Student Union.  Organizational history  =Background= In 1921 the Intercollegiate Socialist Society (ISS) was transformed into the League for Industrial Democracy (LID). With the change in name, the organization broadened its scope to become a more of a general educational society that included not only collegians and alumni, but also non-collegians in its ranks and activities. The organization continued to arrange campus lectures, as well as publishing pamphlets and off-campus speaking tours, but paid little attention to the organization of active campus groups. League student organizations continued at the University of Wisconsin,Students in Revolt: The Story of the Intercollegiate League for Industrial Democracy. New York: League for Industrial Democracy, 1933; pg. 6. Columbia, Vassar,Students in Revolt, pg. 7. Yale, Harvard,Students in Revolt, pg. 8. the University of Texas, and elsewhere, but the emphasis of the national organization remained on building a non-campus movement in tangent with the Socialist Party. By 1929 student members of the LID were outnumbered by non-student members. An Intercollegiate Student Council existed within the group to coordinate the activities of college students, but this was \\"poorly organized and somewhat inactive,\\" according to historian Robert Cohen.Robert Cohen, When the Old Left was Young. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993, pp. 31-33 and pg. 351, fn. 31 and 33. =Depression era activity= The coming of the Great Depression had a radicalizing influence on many students, who saw world capitalism in a state of chaos. Members of the Intercollegiate LID energized by the 1932 Presidential campaign of Norman Thomas, as well as competition with the Communist-led National Student League. In 1932 the student members of the LID held their own national convention which abolished the old Intercollegiate Student Council of the LID and elected instead a new National Executive Committee and national chairman, Maurice Newfield. The new independent organization began to issue a new national magazine, Revolt, (later named Student Outlook) and in 1933 formally adopted for itself the name \\"Student League for Industrial Democracy\\" (SLID).Cohen, When the Old Left was Young, pg. 361, fn.11. Between 1933 and 1935 SLID participated in protests over violations of student free speech, the reception of a \\"good will tour\\" of students from Fascist Italy, the Italian invasion of Ethiopia and instances of racial discrimination, often in conjunction with the Communist Party-led National Student League (NSL).Cohen, When the Old Left was Young, pp. 116, 136, 211.\\"Outbreaks Greet Fascist Students: Visiting Group Ushered Out of City College Hall After Free-for-All Begins,\\" New York Times, October 10, 1934. One of the group's most dramatic activities was organizing the National Student Strike Against War on April 13, 1934 and 1935, commemorating American entry into the First World War. The first strike, coordinated only with the NSL, drew 25,000 students nationwide, 15,000 of which were in New York City. The second demonstration however, in April 1935, drew 175,000 students, 160,000 outside of New York, and was co-sponsored by the National Student Federation of America, the National Council of Methodist Youth, YMCA, YWCA, the Interseminary Movement, the youth section of the American League Against War and Fascism, among others.Cohen, When the Old Left was Young, pp. 92-93. An important aspect of the two annual strikes was an Americanized version of the Oxford Pledge, in which students pledged \\"We will not support the government of the United States in any war it may conduct.\\"Cohen, When the Old Left was Young, pg. 73. =Principles= The Student League for Industrial Democracy proclaimed its goal to be the establishment of \\"a classless cooperative society in which men will have an equal opportunity to achieve the good things of life.\\"Students in Revolt, pg. 10. It took a Fabian approach to this long- term objective, advocating a minimum program which included the organization of labor, expansion of merit-based academic scholarships, defense of civil liberties and academic freedom, and opposition to \\"any manifestation of militarism in education, especially the R.O.T.C.\\" = Merger = With the Student League for Industrial Democracy and the Communist-led National Student League working together so often, there arose sentiment in favor of amalgamating the two organizations. The NSL proposed this first in December 1933, and again the next year. The leadership of the SLID, however, was weary of the NSL uncritical view of the Soviet Union and less than democratic nature of the NSL. Due to the unprecedented size of the April 1935 student strike, however, pressure from within the SLID ranks became difficult for its more cautious leadership to contain. This was especially true on the West Coast, were the local SLID members felt it that anti-fascist unity was a pressing need in the wake of a local red scare. With its California chapters already planning an amalgamation conference for the fall, in June 1935 the SLID National Executive Committee relented buy appointed a committee to discuss the merger with representatives from the NSL. By October they arrived at an agreement to merge the two organizations at a convention that December into a new group to be named the American Student Union.Cohen, When the Old Left was Young, pp. 138-139.
