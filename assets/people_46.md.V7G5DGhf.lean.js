This grad student from Maine solved it in days , August 20, 2020 is an American mathematician who works on geometry and low- dimensional topology. In 2020, Piccirillo published a mathematical proof in the journal Annals of Mathematics determining that the Conway knot is not a slice knot, answering an unsolved problem in knot theory first proposed over fifty years prior by English mathematician John Horton Conway. In July 2020, she became an assistant professor of mathematics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Early life Piccirillo was raised in Greenwood, Maine and attended Telstar Regional High School in Bethel, Maine. Her mother was a middle school math teacher. As a child, she had many hobbies, such as riding dressage, being involved in her church's youth group and she participated in drama and band in school.  Education  Piccirillo earned a B.S. in mathematics from Boston College in 2013 and a PhD in low-dimensional topology at the University of Texas at Austin under the supervision of John Luecke in 2019, followed by postdoctoral research at Brandeis University. Boston College professor Elisenda Grigsby cited Piccirillo's creativity as contributing to her success, adding that Piccirillo did not fit the mold of a \\"standard golden child math prodigy\\" during her undergraduate studies.  Work  The Conway Knot. The slice property of the Conway knot was a long-standing unsolved problem in knot theory. The knot was named after its discoverer, English mathematician John Horton Conway, who first wrote about the knot in 1970. The Conway knot was determined to be topologically slice in the 1980s; however the nature of its sliceness, and whether or not it was smoothly slice, eluded mathematicians for decades up until Piccirillo's breakthrough. Piccirillo's work on the Conway knot completed the classification of slice knots with under thirteen crossings, as the Conway knot had been the last outstanding knot in its group fully unclassified. Piccirillo first learned of the Conway knot problem in 2018 at a conference on low-dimensional topology and geometry. She was a graduate student at the time and spent less than a week working on the knot in her free time before finding an answer. The Washington Post reported that her proof had been \\"hailed as a thing of mathematical beauty, and her work could point to new ways to understand knots.\\" Following the publication of Piccirillo's proof in Annals of Mathematics, she was offered a tenure-track position at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology set to begin fourteen months after the completion of her doctorate. Recognition In association with the 2021 Breakthrough Prizes, Piccirillo was awarded one of three 2021 Maryam Mirzakhani New Frontiers Prizes, for early-career achievements by a woman mathematician. The other two winners were Nina Holden and Urmila Mahadev.

Odencrantz (22 August 1884, Gothenburg, Nebraska ‚Äì 7 April 1969, New York City) was an American social scientist. She was an empirical labor economist who focused on women‚Äôs labor force experience. Education and early career Born in rural Nebraska, where her Scandinavian immigrant parents were homesteading, Odencrantz moved with them first to Texas, then to New York City. She attended the Morris High School in the Bronx and won a scholarship to Barnard College. While majoring in Latin because she expected to become a teacher, she took several economics courses from Columbia professors whose ideas shaped U.S. economic and social policies during the twentieth century. Inspired by them and by female speakers at campus events, who emphasized that, even without the suffrage, women could work for social justice, she applied for a fellowship to the College Settlement on Rivington Street, one of the settlement houses that were opening in American cities to serve the growing immigrant population. After gaining her B.A. in 1907, she enrolled in graduate courses at Columbia University, and, while staying at the settlement on the Lower East Side, investigated the conditions of women working in local factories. She earned her M.A. in social sciences in 1908. Survey, a national journal that featured the work of leading social scientists and reformers, published her thesis, ‚ÄúThe Irregularity of Employment of Women Factory Workers,‚Äù in May 1909 with photographs by Lewis Hine, one of the major documentary photographers of the century. After completing her degree, Odencrantz joined the staff of the Russell Sage Foundation. Under the guidance of Mary Van Kleeck, head of the Foundation's Committee on Women‚Äôs Work, she and other researchers studied the millinery industry, the bookbinding trade, artificial flower-making and working girls in evening schools. She also directed a study of Italian women in industry, published under her name, and took part in an investigation of industrial conditions in Springfield, Illinois. Employment services and personnel work From 1915 to 1919, Odencrantz served as superintendent of New York State‚Äôs first public employment bureau for women, where she developed effective procedures and connected thousands of women with jobs‚Äîmany in non-traditional fields. U.S. entry into World War I increased the need for female labor and expanded the scope of her activities to include Federal employment services in the state. When funding for public employment bureaus declined, Odencrantz took a position in private industry as personnel manager for a silk manufacturer. She helped settle a strike with an agreement that recognized the interests of both workers and employers and was acknowledged by the U.S. Department of Labor as a model of its kind. At a time when the country had turned isolationist, she joined colleagues in founding the International Industrial Relations Institute and attended several conferences in Europe; in 1925 she was elected vice president of the organization. After the silk factory closed, she produced a job study of social work, directed an employment agency for disabled workers, and became a strong advocate for the inclusion of this marginalized group. During the 1930s, Frances Perkins recruited her to serve on state and federal commissions on unemployment measures; she helped prepare guidelines for implementation of the Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933, contributed to a study of public employment services in the United States for the Social Science Research Council, and served as head of training for the New York State Department of Labor, Division of Placement and Unemployment Insurance from 1937-1941.[2] Active retirement In 1946, Odencrantz retired from her final position as executive director of the Social Work Vocational Bureau. She remained active in the Democratic Party and other causes that had engaged her throughout her life, volunteered for domestic organizations, and supported international associations including the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom and the United World Federalists.

February 27, 1956) is an American neurologist and neuroimmunologist and the Section Head of Neuroimmunology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri. Cross holds the Manny and Rosalyn Rosenthal‚ÄìDr. John L. Trotter Endowed Chair in Neuroimmunology at WUSTL School of Medicine and co-directs the John L Trotter Multiple Sclerosis Clinic at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. Cross is a leader in the field of neuroimmunology and was the first to discover the role of B cells in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis in animals and then in humans. Cross now develops novel imaging techniques to observe inflammation and demyelination in the central nervous systems of MS patients for diagnosis and disease management.  Early life and education  Cross grew up in Mobile, Alabama. Cross pursued her undergraduate degree at the University of South Alabama in Mobile, Alabama. She majored in chemistry and graduated summa cum laude with her Bachelors of Science in 1976. After completing her Bachelors, Cross pursued a medical degree at the University of Alabama School of Medicine in Birmingham, Alabama. Cross completed her medical training in 1980 and then pursued a residency in neurology at George Washington University School of Medicine in Washington, D.C. Cross completed her residency in 1984 and pursued further medical specialization through several fellowships. Cross first completed fellowship training in Neuroimmunology at the National Institutes of Health, in Bethesda Maryland. After completing this training in 1986, Cross completed her next fellowship in the Department of Virology and Molecular Biology at St. Jude Children‚Äôs Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Cross completed her final fellowship in Neuropathology in 1990 with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, New York. Her education and training focused in neuroimmunology and the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis set up Cross to merge her clinical and research careers in a translational and patient-directed way.  Career and research  In 1990, Cross became an Assistant Professor of Neurology and Pathology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. She held this position for one year and was then recruited to Washington University in St. Louis where she became an Associate Professor of Neurology with tenure. In 2003, Cross was named the Manny and Rosalyn Rosenthal-Dr. John L. Trotter MS Center Chair in Neuroimmunology within the Barnes-Jewish Hospital Foundation. She now is the co-director of the John L. Trotter MS Center at Washington University School of Medicine as well as the Section Head of Neuroimmunology. In addition to her faculty and research roles, Cross sees about 2000 patients annually who suffer from multiple sclerosis. Cross is the principal investigator of the Cross Lab where she explores the pathogenesis of demyelination and inflammation in the central nervous system with a specific focus on the mechanisms of multiple sclerosis and the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. The lab currently focuses on developing novel imaging techniques to differentiate between different types of demyelinating and inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system. Cross also focuses on the effects of the diet and calorie restriction on brain inflammation. = B cells in multiple sclerosis = Early in Cross‚Äôs career, there was a debate regarding the role of B cells in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. Cross sought to settle the debate concerning the role of B cells in MS and showed, in 1999, that B cells in fact play a major role of the pathogenesis of the disease. When a large polypeptide is used to induce experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS in animals, B cells are critical to initiating the onset of disease. This process is thought to be similar to the onset of autoimmune disease in humans when a complex protein antigen is the stimulus for the autoimmune response. They further found that B cells are not critical for the induction of an autoimmune response by small peptides which might explain the previous debates and discrepancies in results concerning the role of B cells in EAE and MS. Cross then sought to determine a way to target B cells as a means of treatment for MS. She used rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that targets CD20, to deplete B cells and observed that depletion of B cells abrogated disease and reduced T cell infiltration of the central immune system. Cross elucidated that Rituximab is an effective treatment for MS in humans through modulation of B cells, though the exact mechanisms are still to be determined. To determine what the optimal response to rituximab therapy is, Cross looked at the tissue biomarkers of patients with multiple sclerosis on rituximab therapy. She found that rituximab therapy led to decreased markers of inflammation and higher IgG and CXCL13 in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients when successful. = Imaging techniques for multiple sclerosis = In order to track demyelinating diseases and diagnose them in patients, Cross began exploring various imaging techniques as a means to diagnose inflammatory and demyelinating disease. She found that diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was a useful tool for observing demyelination in patients and could serve as a tool to detect axon injury and guide therapies. Cross also has used DTI to detect acute optic neuritis, since axial diffusivity can serve as a marker of axon injury in white matter. Cross later found that DTI could also be used to effectively detect spinal cord tissue injury as well in ms and neuromyelitis optica. An important breakthrough that Cross and her colleagues made recently was discovering that gradient echo MRI can be used to reliably assess cortical gray matter damage, a common finding in MS patients. With these novel imaging techniques, Cross has enabled the field with the ability to track disease course in human patients which will improve understanding of disease progress in a non-invasive way. = Diet and neuroimmune disease = Cross, in collaboration with a former mentee Laura Piccio, have been elucidating the impacts of diet on multiple sclerosis and CNS inflammation. They have previously found that calorie restriction abrogates EAE symptoms in animal models. Specifically, they found that intermittent fasting in mice with EAE had increases microbial diversity. The immunomodulatory effects of intermittent fasting suggest that it could pose as a potential therapy for MS.

He previously was a candidate in the 2020 elections for Connecticut state senator for the 28th district, dropping out before the August primaries. He is the older brother of first grade student Jesse Lewis, a victim of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut.  Early life and education  JT Lewis was born Joseph Theodore Lewis on May 18, 2000, to Scarlett Lewis. He is the older brother of six-year-old Jesse Lewis, who was a first grade student at Sandy Hook Elementary School when he and others were killed in a shooting at the school on December 14, 2012. He was a twelve-year-old seventh grade student when his brother died. Lewis was raised on a farm with his younger brother and they had horses, dogs, and chickens, which their mother bought in 1998. Several days after the shooting, former president Barack Obama met with Lewis, his mother, and the victims' families at Newtown High School. Lewis recalled the event years later saying that \\"President Obama treated me with the utmost respect and class. More importantly, [he] honored my brother‚Äôs memory.\\" Months after the shooting, Lewis's mother was crying after being reminded of Jesse's death, with Lewis telling her \\"You know mom, time isn't the same on earth as it is in heaven. In heaven, a lifetime is a second, so Jesse won't have to wait very long to be with us again.\\" Lewis attended Newtown High School and was on the varsity football team, graduating in 2018. He currently attends University of Connecticut as a political science major.  Advocacy and politics  U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, in 2018. After the shooting, Lewis became an advocate for trauma victims and founded the organization Newtown Helps Rwanda, which raises money for relatives of the victims of the 1994 Rwanda genocide to attend college and also participates in other causes. Survivors of the genocide reached out to Lewis via Skype to talk about their traumatic experiences losing family members due to violence and offer their condolences to him. As a gesture of gratitude to the survivors, Lewis founded the organization to raise money for their education. After a few months of fundraising, the organization raised enough money to send several survivors to college and have raised over $35,000. Lewis's organization also helped Ugandan former child soldiers build fishponds and poultry farms for self-sufficiency. The organization has expanded its focus to several causes to help victims of trauma, such as victims and suvivors of automobile accidents. He has also interned for the non-profit organization Jesse Lewis Choose Love Movement, which his mother founded. Lewis co-won the Courage Award at the 2016 Teen Choice Awards for his advocacy work. The award was presented to him by singer Ne-Yo and actress Jessica Alba. He also met with singer Justin Timberlake after the ceremony. Lewis met with president Donald Trump in 2018 and participated in a roundtable discussion in the Roosevelt Room on the Federal Commission on School Safety report that was published after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting to address gun violence in American schools. He attended with his mother Scarlett and sat next to Andrew Pollack, father of Meadow Pollack, a victim of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, two seats away from the President. He shared his ideas about how to improve school safety with the President and other commission members. After the meeting, Lewis had a private moment with his mother and the President in the Oval Office. After the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in 2018, Lewis became involved in school safety reform and policy. In July 2019, Lewis announced that he was running as a Republican in the 2020 elections to represent Connecticut's 28th senate district in the Connecticut State Senate and unseat third-term incumbent senator Tony Hwang. He decided to run for public office to honor his younger brother. His campaign was centered on improving gun regulations, mental health and mental health law, and improving school safety. He has been critical of Hwang, saying that Hwang is \\"all about taking pictures and not taking action.\\" Though he was running as a Republican, Lewis has expressed himself as a unifying figure and working with all lawmakers. If he won the election, he said he would still continue to attend the University of Connecticut as a state senator. He dropped out of the election in July. He announced on Instagram on July 10 that he accepted a position with President Donald Trump's 2020 campaign.  Political views  Lewis is a member of the Republican Party and has said he is supportive of president Donald Trump and his administration. He supports improving national background checks on gun purchases. Commenting on his work with the Federal Commission on School Safety report, Lewis commented \\"It's not 100 percent perfect, but it is a great first step in the school safety movement.\\" He also supports improving security at schools, including having armed guards at schools. Lewis is supportive of LGBT civil rights and is a supporter of gun rights and the Second Amendment. He criticized the non-profit organization Sandy Hook Promise for using graphic images in their PSAs about school shootings. Lewis views that Twitter's recent crackdown on President Trump's tweets that glorify violence as a \\"direct threat to our national security\\".  Personal life  Since 2019, Lewis has been dating grocery clerk Sophia Vetare, both meeting Vice President Mike Pence and Advisor to the President (his daughter) Ivanka Trump in February 2020.

Overview The chapel is located on the site of the Battle of Koromogawa, and was built on the ruins of the of Fujiwara no Motohari as was mentioned in the Azuma Kagami. The palace was located on a hill overlooking the Kitakami River some 500 meters east-southeast of the temple of Ch≈´son-ji. In 1189, it was occupied by Fujiwara no Yasuhira, who extended shelter to Minamoto no Yoshitsune after the latter had a falling out with his brother, Minamoto no Yoritomo. This provided Yoritomo with a pretext to declare war on the Northern Fujiwara and his forces quickly overran the defenses of Hiraizumi. The palace was destroyed and was the site of Yoshitsune's last stand with his faithful retainer Benkei, as was celebrated in the medieval account Gikeiki. In 1683, the 4th daimy≈ç of Sendai Domain, Date Tsunamura built a memorial chapel on the site, and enshrined a statue of Yotsushine.

The complex is centered around the mausoleum of Abu al-Abbas as-Sabti (or Sidi Bel Abbes), a Sufi teacher who died in 1204. He is the most venerated of the Seven Saints of Marrakesh, generally considered the \\"patron saint\\" of the city. The zawiya's architecture dates in large part to the late Saadian period (early 17th century) but has been modified and restored multiple times since then.  History  Abu al-Abbas al-Sabti (full name: Sidi Ahmed ibn Dja'far al-Khazraji Abu al-Abbas as-Sabti) was born in Ceuta in 1129 or 1130. He studied under Abu Abd Allah al-Fakhkhar, who was in turn a student of Qadi Ayyad (another of the seven saints buried in Marrakesh). In 1146 he moved to Marrakesh during the final weeks of the Almohad siege of the city and established himself there after its capture, mainly staying on the hill of Jbel Gilliz (or Gueliz). subsequently receiving financial support from the Almohad regime. Abu al-Abbas's doctrine was relatively simple, placing great emphasis on charity (zakat and sadaqah), inciting the rich to give to the poor. He was distinguished by his generosity, which in turn gained him considerable popularity. When he died in 1204 he was buried in an unmarked grave in the former Cemetery of Sidi Marwan, near Bab Taghzout (the northern gate of the city at the time). Over time he acquired a reputation for having performed miracles and he became the most important patron saint of Marrakesh, as well as more specifically the patron saint of commerce. His barakah (blessing) was also said to aid or cure illnesses, and especially to assist the blind; a reputation which has more or less remained to the present day. Eventually a mausoleum was built over his tomb and it became the site of a popular pilgrimage. The current complex around his tomb, however, was initially built by the Saadian sultan Abu Faris Abdallah during his reign between 1603 and 1608. Abu Faris built the mosque and the minaret, as well as madrasa and library. He was reportedly motivated to do this because he suffered from severe epilepsy (which was attributed to djinns) and hoped that by patronizing the tomb of Sidi Bel Abbes he could receive blessings that would cure him. The zawiya was originally located outside the city walls, near the former northern gate of Bab Taghzout, but his zawiya attracted more and more settlers to the area until a flourishing neighbourhood developed here outside the walls of the city. In the late 17th century, Abu al-Abbas was chosen as one of the \\"Seven Saints\\" of Marrakesh and his tomb became one of the stops in an associated ziyara (pilgrimage) established on the initiative of the Alaouite sultan Moulay Isma'il (ruled 1672‚Äì1727). Moulay Isma'il also built the main mausoleum chamber over the tomb in 1720. In the 18th century, under the reign of the Alaouite sultan Muhammad ibn Abdallah (also spelled \\"Mohammed Ben Abdallah\\"), the walls of the city were finally extended to encompass the zawiya and its neighbourhood, forming the new northern point of the city. Muhammad ibn Abdallah also renovated the mausoleum and its mosque in 1756. The complex was expanded again in the 19th century. It was renovated again in 1988 on the order of King Hassan II.

It sparked a lengthy legal and protest dispute between his partner and immediate family, who wanted him buried in Christchurch, and his wider family and Kutarere elders, who wanted him to remain buried at Kutarere. In 2011, courts found the wider family had acted illegally in taking the body without the wife's permission. Attempts to disintern the body in 2014 were blocked by protesters. The two parties reached a confidential resolution through mediation in 2015. The case sparked a wider legal and ethical debate about New Zealand's burial laws. =Recent history= One person was burnt during a house fire in Kutarere in August 2016.

It is restricted to the Blue Mountains in New South Wales. Description Leionema lachnaeoides is a tall shrub to high with white stems covered in fine, smooth, silver star-shaped hairs quickly becoming smooth. The leaves are more or less terete , long, wide, arranged alternately along the branches on a flattened petiole, with a slight upward curve and ending in a point. The leaf upper and lower side and edges are smooth, surface leathery, margins rolled under almost obscuring the paler underside. The flowers are borne singly on a short peduncle about long in upper leaf axils and covered in soft star-shaped hairs. The pedicel is fleshy and about long with 4 tiny bracts at the base. The green calyx lobes are triangular-shaped, about long and smooth. The spreading, five yellow flower petals are narrowly oval shaped, about long, smooth and dotted with glands. The 5 prominent, yellow stamens only slightly longer than the petals. The dry fruit are rounded with a distinctive long beak and the seed is dispersed on maturity in early summer. Flowering occurs between winter and late spring. Taxonomy and naming This species was described in 1825 by Allan Cunningham, but the name was changed to Leionema lachnaeoides in 1998 by Paul G. Wilson and the description was published in the journal Nuytsia. The specific epithet (lachnaeoides) is from the Greek lachne- meaning \\"soft wool\\" and -oides meaning \\"resembling\\" a reference to the hairiness of the species.

Biography Chatterton was born in Clerkenwell in central London. His father was a practitioner of Japanning, a form of lacquerwork, but an accident left him unable to continue his craft. Chatterton suffered poor health when young and his attempts to establish himself as a bootmaker were unsuccessful. In the 1850s, at the time of the Crimean War he enlisted in the army, but appears to have spent much of his military service in a hospital in Malta. He subsequently earned what seems to have been a precarious living as a bill poster and a peddler of left-wing literature. Chatterton married twice ‚Äì his first wife, Emma, died in St Pancras workhouse at the age of 32. He lived in slum housing in the Cromer Street area of King's Cross and later around Drury Lane in Covent Garden. He was buried in an unmarked grave in St Pancras cemetery in Finchley. Of his children, only one, Alfred, outlived him. Political activism Chatterton said that he imbibed his atheism and freethought from his father. By his own account, he was 'badly injured' when police used violence to clear a Chartist protest on Clerkenwell Green in 1848.Biography of Dan Chatterton He appears to have been influenced by the ideas of the Chartist and socialist Bronterre O'Brien and was prominent in several of the small extreme radical groups which emerged in the early 1870s. At about this time, he published the first of his own pamphlets, in total producing at least twenty titles often incendiary in tone, denouncing the royal family, organised religion and government and urging workers to revolt. While the tone of Chatterton's writings was intemperate and angry, he also addressed issues which touched directly on the lives of the urban poor. He advocated birth control so that women could enjoy 'all the sexual pleasures of love, of life, of all desire' without giving birth to children they could not afford to feed. In another pamphlet, he expressed fierce criticism of slum clearances which left slum-dwellers homeless and argued that land and houses should be nationalised. In 1884, Chatterton began publishing the 'Scorcher', which appeared roughly every three months - more than forty issues in all - for the rest of his life. It was often produced on cheap paper with irregular type and printed without a press. He was the only contributor. The full title, 'Chatterton's Commune, the Atheistic Communist Scorcher' reflected his interest in the Paris Commune of 1871 as a model of working class self- organisation and rebellion. He repeatedly denounced \\"kingcraft\\" and \\"priestcraft\\" and the various \\"shams and swindles\\" which he saw as perpetuating inequality and the misery of the urban poor. Chatterton has been described as 'a born contrarian' who was also 'an authentic voice, steeped in British and continental political demands, typical themselves of the result of Victorian non-conformity'. Chatterton was a regular orator at outdoor speaking pitches and often spoke from the floor at religious and political meetings. His outlandish appearance and fierce polemics gained him a reputation - and a degree of affection - beyond the confined circles of left-wing activists. Although Chatterton did not describe himself as an anarchist, his highly individualist and insurrectionary style of propaganda gained the attention of anarchist activists who came to regard him as one of their own. 'Old Chat', as he sometimes styled himself, became known as a character of the London streets and several novelists based fictional characters on him, including Richard Whiteing in his 1899 best-seller 'No 5 John Street' and also W. Pett Ridge and John Henry Mackay and perhaps George Gissing.

Since 2003 Klasiƒá is a professor at the Department of History at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences of the University of Zagreb. His work focuses on contemporary Croatian and world history. Klasiƒá is a prominent critic of attempts at rehabilitation of the World War II fascist Usta≈°a movement in the country. He is ambassador for the European Association of History Educators. Early life and education Hrvoje Klasiƒá was born in Sisak in Socialist Republic of Croatia (Yugoslavia) on 6 December 1972. In 1991, when he was 18, he was a military volunteer in Croatian forces during the Croatian War of Independence. In an interview for Bosnian daily newspaper Dnevni avaz he sarcastically commented that if he was a victim of the war he would be a hero in his town, but since he was not some consider him today to be a traitor. Klasiƒá completed his undergraduate (in 1972), master and doctoral studies at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences of the University of Zagreb. In 1995-2003 period he was employed as a high school (gymnasium) professor in Sisak.

Public engagement Hrvoje Klasiƒá is a prominent critic of historical revisionism in Croatia, specifically attempts at rehabilitation of the World War II fascist Usta≈°a movement in the country, which made him a target of nationalist threats. Klasiƒá welcomed the decision by Austrian authorities to ban and sanction the public display of the WWII Usta≈°a movement‚Äôs symbols. Klasiƒá is also critical of unbalanced and negative interpretation of Yugoslavism, underlining that the idea have a long history among Croat intellectual elites including the Roman Catholic clergy starting with 15th century Vinko Pribojeviƒá, and subsequently Josip Juraj Strossmayer and Franjo Raƒçki. His interpretation of the Croatian War of Independence as a \\"war of aggression with the elements of civil war\\" was criticized by many in Croatia. He underlined that the war in Croatia started before the international recognition and that the republic's Serb citizens from Petrinja, Vukovar, Glina or Knin fought with Croat citizens which are all elements of a civil war. He underlined that other civil conflicts such as Lebanese Civil War and Spanish Civil War included significant foreign interference which still does not make them exclusively wars of aggression. In February 2020, together with Vesna Ter≈°eliƒç, Dra≈æen Laliƒá, ≈Ωarko Puhovski, and other members of the Antifascist League of Croatia, he condemned an attack on Nata≈°a Kandiƒá by the group allegedly instructed by Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj, ICTY convicted war criminal and president of nationalist Serbian Radical Party. In relation to right-wing bias of the Croatian Wikipedia Hrvoje Klasiƒá stated that ‚Äúthere is a large difference‚Äù between English-language and Croatian Wikipedia. He stated that occasionally he tells his students to look something up on English-language Wikipedia if the article has plenty of academic and scientific references. Contrary he stated that, ‚ÄúI would never give Croatian Wikipedia to my students if they want to learn something about the Croatian history.

He was a member of the management of the Socialist Youth, Secretary General of the PSOE in Cadiz, Secretary of Organization of the PSOE in Andalusia and Secretary of Municipal Policy and Secretary of Institutional and Autonomous Relations in the Federal Executive Committee of the PSOE. Alfonso Perales was at the historic Suresnes Congress in 1974, and over time he helped rebuild the structure of the PSOE, first in Cadiz and then in Andalusia. Endowed with an extraordinary capacity for irony and sense of humour, he practised politics from the principles of loyalty to institutions and the search for agreement and consensus. His last great contribution to the PSOE and to Spanish politics was the negotiation in the Congress of Deputies of the reform of the Statute of Andalusia with the rest of the political forces, his assistance being fundamental so that the reform of the Andalusian Statute, which had not been voted on by the PP in Andalusia, could achieve a broad consensus in the Spanish Parliament. In the institutional field, he was elected councillor in the City Council of Cadiz and between 1983 and 1987 President of the Provincial Council of Cadiz. From 1989 to 1996, he obtained the act of deputy to the Congress, and later he joined the Andalusian Government as Minister of Governance. He returned as a member of Congress in 2004. After the general elections of 2004, he coordinated the political position of the PSOE in the reforms of the Statutes of Autonomy of the Valencian Community, Catalonia and Andalusia.

Pavlou is also known for organising protests on-campus in support of the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests, activism for increased scrutiny around universities' international relationships and against Chinese government policies on Uyghurs and Tibetans. He is currently subject to a one-semester suspension from the university over what disciplinary and appeals boards have described as \\"serious misconduct\\". Early life Pavlou's family are Greek Cypriots from the Larnaca District of Cyprus, migrating to Australia in the 1960s to open a number of hospitality and retail shops on the Gold Coast in Queensland. He was born on 4 June 1999, something that he has linked to the end of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. At two-years-old, Pavlou's family moved to Brisbane, where he would then go on to complete high school at Villanova College, admitting to having a tense relationship with authority from a young age. He was then admitted to the University of Queensland where he was studying for a Bachelor of Arts majoring in Philosophy before his suspension. His grandmother‚Äôs brother was a fighter with Greek nationalist guerrilla organization EOKA, and was killed during the Cyprus Emergency. 2019 Hong Kong protests In July 2019, during the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests, Pavlou organised a protest at the University of Queensland in support of Hong Kong democracy. He has alleged that he was assaulted twice during clashes with counter-protestors. Brisbane-based Chinese Consular-General and Adjunct Professor at UQ, Xu Jie, responded to the protests by condoning counter- protestors for ‚Äúself-motivated patriotic behaviour‚Äù and condemning the protest as ‚Äúanti-China separatist activities‚Äù. Pavlou responded by alleging Xu Jie was inciting violence and issuing a death threat, a claim which was rejected by the Chinese embassy in Canberra. The Magistrates Court rejected the application for a case before it was heard at trial, citing international diplomatic immunity laws. Suspension from the University of Queensland Throughout April and May 2020, Pavlou was summoned to the University of Queensland disciplinary board after a 186-page report suggested he violated university student discipline policies 11 times, including by bullying, discriminating against, and harassing students and staff online and on-campus. ABC News has reported that complaints raised to the board include Pavlou improperly claiming to make statements on behalf of the university and a Facebook post of Pavlou posing in front of the UQ Confucious Institute in a biohazard suit during the COVID-19 pandemic with the caption: Pavlou has admitted to directing profanity at students on Facebook and another university forum after complaints were raised by a number of students. Complaints included in the dossier alleged that Pavlou called UQ business and finance students \\"\\", and that they held no views beyond that of wealthy parents. In another incident, after being called a \\"dog\\" by international students on Facebook, Pavlou responded with \\" your ancestors to the 18th generation\\", a highly offensive insult in Mandarin. Pavlou then invited the student to a cafe on-campus with the comment, \\"I'll be the one in the black jumper. We will see who the dog is \\". It is unclear if the Facebook incident actually formed part of the case against Pavlou. On 5 May, Pavlou walked out of a disciplinary board hearing, labelling the hearing as a \\"Stalinist show trial\\" and threatening to take the matter to Queensland's highest court, the Supreme Court. Pavlou's legal team claimed that they were denied access to confidential university documents that may demonstrate UQ collusion with the Chinese government. A spokesperson for the university stated that the matter did not concern political freedom of speech but misbehaviour, that university policy is developed independently of politics, and that the university was unable to comment directly on the matters of the hearing. On 29 May, the board handed down its decision to suspend Pavlou for two years, the remainder of Pavlou's tenure as UQ senator. UQ Chancellor Peter Varghese expressed concern on the UQ News website about \\"the findings and the severity of the penalty\\", convening an out-of-session meeting of the UQ Senate to discuss the matter. On 2 June, Pavlou sought a review from the UQ Senate Disciplinary Appeals Committee (SDAC), the appellate body for disciplinary matters formed from the UQ Senate, and student and staff representatives. Part of the appeal case presented includes an email sent to his barrister from someone claiming to be a victim of Pavlou's comments, stating: Queensland University of Technology Student Guild President Olivia Brumm, who claims to have viewed the 186-page case against Pavlou, has told the ABC that she thought the majority of the 11 allegations were \\"absurdly trivial\\", as they related to Pavlou's behaviour at protests or online. Pavlou, in response to the report, claimed that one of the allegations surrounded him testing a pen in a campus shop and placing it back on the shelf, something Brumm confirms was in the report. She went on to describe Pavlou as \\"a very outspoken and brash and kind of unapologetic person\\", that he \\"takes a lot of issue with the things that the university administration does, and the way they conduct themselves\\", and that the way the report was compiled \\"indicate[s] that there is a vendetta against Drew\\". On 13 July, SDAC issued its findings, concluding that two counts of serious misconduct were justified, however dismissing other charges. As a result, SDAC reduced the suspension from two years to one semester (roughly six months). In a statement released by the Committee and Chancellor Varghese, they explained that \\"neither of the findings of serious misconduct concerned Mr Pavlou‚Äôs personal or political views about China or Hong Kong\\", and that Pavlou is now ineligible under the University of Queensland Act (as UQ is a public university) to return as a senator. His seat was filled by the candidate with the next most vote from the 2019 Senate elections, Bachelor of Science student, Gabii Starr. In September 2020, the Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission declined a request by Pavlou to investigate Chancellor Varghese and former Vice-Chancellor Peter H√∏j, saying there was \\"insufficient evidence to suggest anyone who was subject of the complaint had engaged in corrupt conduct\\". The university responded in a press statement that it was pleased by the findings, and that it had been advised by the commission that no action will be taken.  Court case against the University of Queensland  On 11 June 2020, Pavlou launched a case against the University of Queensland, Chancellor Varghese, and former Vice-Chancellor H√∏j, seeking damages of 3.5 million for an alleged breach of contract and defamation. The case was lodged with the Supreme Court of Queensland. In a response to an ABC News inquiry, a UQ spokesperson said, \\"when we receive a formal notice of claim we will consider it and respond through the appropriate channels.\\" Pavlou announced the case on Twitter, saying he was \\"seeking damages for breach of contract, negligence, defamation, deceit and conspiracy\\" and that the case was \\"not about money\\".

All these locomotives were withdrawn by the late 1990s.  History  The history of WDS-3 class starts in the early 1961s with the aim of the Indian Railways(IR) to address the growing requirement for a shunting locomotive. These locomotives was designed by Mak to specification set by RDSO. Many aspects of this locomotive were taken from the DB Class V 60. They use Suri transmission developed for these diesel locomotives and were designed as shunting-cum-shuttle service locomotives. For this purpose, the reversing gear box attached to the Suri transmission was designed to have two gear stages; in the lower gear, designated as \\"shunting gear\\", the locomotive was designated to have a maximum speed of 27 Km and in the higher speed gear designated as \\"Mainline gear\\", the maximum locomotive speed was 65 I<m/h. The 1ocomotive was fit for both shunting and mainline type of services up to a limited speed of 65 Km/h. Subsequently, it was decided to manufacture locomotives of similar type ingeniously by CLW. These locomotive are designated as WDS4/WDS4B class. When the lot of 7 WDS3 shunters came,initially they had a lot of troubles with these locomotives, but the trouble was confined more to the power pack than to the transmission. But in course of time,going into detail about the troubles that were being experienced and the mechanics were able to get over a lot of these difficulties and in-fact the transmission was also modified to suit with the engine. By 1979 Out of 7 locomotives, five are still after 15 years of service working and did not have trouble. But by 1990s all units were withdrawn from service.

History  During WW2 the USATC took effective control of the ports of Bombay, Calcutta and Karachi and to operate them obtained 50 General Electric built Bo-Bo diesel locos; these were a standard General Electric 45 ton design of locomotive. When delivered to India the locos were split between the BAR, BB&CIR;, GIPR and NWR and were used for working military traffic between the ports and mainline railways. After the war they became the property of the mainline railways and in turn became IR locos. Post war they were designated as ADE class and on IR they were WDS-1 class. One unidentified member of the class has been preserved and is now at the DLW, Varanasi. Upon the departure of the Americans, the locos all became part of the stocks of their respective companies. In 8/1947 14 of the locos became the property Pakistan. Unsurprisingly all the NWR examples were among these along with two each from BBCIR (6500-01), GIPR (6526-27) and the BAR pair. They became their ADE36 class with the running numbers 6501 to 6514. The ones that remained in India became ADE class locos and were numbered 410 to 425. All but one of these 15 became WDS-1 class locos and received the numbers 19000 to 14. The missing loco was sold to CLW for use as their works shunter where it remains albeit now preserved.

The WAG-5 though were greatly successes, had become underpowered to meet the growing demands of the Indian Railways. So in early 1990s decided to look for a successor the WAG-5 class. The required specification was of a 5000 horsepower locomotive. Initially, the Indian railways invited tenders to build locomotives to the new specification. The following responses were received: * CLW submitted their upgraded WAG-5 model with 5000 hp with Co-Co bogies. * BHEL submitted a 5000 hp locomotive with thyristors control and Co-Co bogies Each company submitted their prototypes and Indian Railways designated these prototypes as the WAG-7 class and WAG-8 class respectively. Development on the WAG-8 class in 1990 while BHEL was also manufacturing WAG-5HS. Technologically the BHEL WAG-8 was meant to be superior to the WAG-7 which was effectively using tap-changer technology from the 1960s. They most likely had the Hitachi HS15250A seen in present day WCAM-3 and WCAG-1.These locos were to be handed it over to Railways for trial in December, 1992, but the whole project was cancelled due to arrival of the WAG-9 and thyristors control had become obsolete to 3 Phase AC technology.

Early life He was the second, posthumously-born son of John Ley Hichens, army surgeon, and his wife, Catherine Bacchus (1843‚Äì1924), and was known as Nel Hichens. His father became surgeon to the 1st Staffordshire Regiment of Foot in 1858; he was later a physician in St Ives, Cornwall. His mother was a daughter of William Bacchus of Edgbaston. Hichens was educated at Winchester College, and studied at New College, Oxford, in France and in Germany. He was briefly a teacher at Sherborne School. He joined the City Imperial Volunteers during the Black Week of the early Second Boer War, and served as a dispatch rider. With Lionel Curtis, Hichens was under Sam Hughes in Henry Settle's column. Lord Cromer in 1900 gave him an administrative position in British Egypt. Shortly, Hichens was brought back to South Africa, co-opted into Milner's Kindergarten. He was treasurer of Johannesburg in 1901‚Äì2, and of the Transvaal from 1902 to 1907. He went on a royal commission to India headed by Charles Hobhouse in 1907, and on a board of enquiry to Southern Rhodesia in 1909. He also contributed to the founding of the Round Table movement. In business In 1910 Hichens became chairman of the engineering firm Cammell Laird, despite a lack of business experience. It is assumed that the influence of William Palmer, 2nd Earl of Selborne, a mentor, was involved in the appointment. During World War I he was heavily involved with the Ministry of Munitions, in partnership with Robert Brand setting up the Imperial Munitions Board. They went to Canada in autumn 1915, and resolved the administrative supply difficulties, to the satisfaction of Robert Borden and Sam Hughes, by appointing Joseph Flavelle to head the new board, replacing the existing Shell Committee.Keith Neilson, R. H. Brand, the Empire and Munitions from Canada, The English Historical Review Vol. 126, No. 523 (December 2011), pp. 1430‚Äì1455, at p. 1436. Published by: Oxford University Press Hichens chaired from 1916 the Central Council of Associations of Controlled Firms for armament suppliers. After the war, Hichens continued as chairman at Cammell Laird, and served on a number of public bodies. He was brought in as chairman at English Electric in 1927, which under the management of John Pybus had seen serious mistakes made: Pybus suffered a breakdown that year. Cammell Laird had common ground with English Electric, which had taken over Coventry Ordnance Works from it in 1918, and a financial stake through loans made. At this time John Brown & Company held a controlling interest. Hichens stayed as chairman until 1930, when restructuring had occurred and Holberry Mensforth had been brought in, who recruited George Nelson. In 1928 the English Steel Corporation was formed, in which Cammell Laird and Vickers pooled their steel interests. The amalgamation involved Hichens in the closure of steel plants at Grimsthorpe and Penistone. Hichens died in a bombing raid during The Blitz on 14 October 1940, as a bomb hit Church House, Westminster. Views Hichens was considered a progressive employer, with views on working hours, minimum wage and job security comparable to those of Lord Leverhulme and Seebohm Rowntree. He gave two Rowntree Lectures during the 1920s. In the wartime context of the Ministry of Munitions he had suggested a type of joint industrial council, about which George Ranken Askwith had reservations. He gave a paper in 1919 to the Society for Arts on \\"The Wage Problem in Industry\\", which caused Askwith to express astonishment. In 1919 Hichens spoke at the United Summer School in Swanwick, Derbyshire, and published the talk as The New Spirit in Industrial Relations, an early use of \\"industrial relations\\" as a term. The Summer School was an inter-denominational conference for those attending adult schools. He was an activist for the Industrial Christian Fellowship (ICF), formed in 1920 when the Christian Social Union (UK) (CSU) merged with the Navvy Mission Society. David Carnegie, whom Hichens had encountered on the Shell Committee and Imperial Munitions Board, was a CSU supporter and Liberal Party candidate who adopted his line on industrial relations in the ICF. A proponent of adult education, Hichens chaired the board of governors of Birkbeck College from 1927. Family In 1919 Hichens married Mary Hermione Lyttelton, daughter of General Neville Lyttelton and sister of Lucy Masterman and Hilda Margaret Grenfell. They had three sons and three daughters. Their daughter Stella (born 1927), an opera singer, married in 1951 Richard Phipps Hornby.

Bondovsky fought in World War I as a junior officer and was wounded during the Russian Civil War. He held command positions between the wars and rose to regimental and then division command during the 1930s. At the outbreak of Operation Barbarossa in June 1941 he commanded the 85th Rifle Division, which was destroyed in Belarus during the first weeks of the war. Escaping the encirclement on foot, he was captured twice but slipped out of prisoner columns moving to the rear. Bondovsky did not reach Soviet lines until December and after being cleared by an investigation served as an instructor at a training course. He returned to the front in late 1943 as a deputy corps commanded and soon received command of the 324th Rifle Division in fighting in eastern Belarus. In early 1944 he was severely wounded in action and after months of hospitalization returned to the training course. He retired soon after the war ended for health reasons.  Early life, World War I, and Russian Civil War  A Russian, Bondovsky was born on 25 December 1896 in Penza and graduated from a gymnasium school. He was mobilized into the Imperial Russian Army in August 1915 and became a one-year volunteer of the second category due to his relatively rare secondary education. He was sent to the 28th Reserve Battalion at Chuguyev camp, later moved to Kharkov. From January 1916 he was a junker at the 4th Moscow Warrant Officer School. After graduating from the school in April, Bondovsky served with the 186th Reserve Regiment at Narovchat as a junior officer of a company and platoon commander. Sent to Yamburg with a march battalion in July, he served on the Northern Front with the 174th Romny Infantry Regiment of the 44th Infantry Division of the 12th Army as junior officer of a company, rising to half-company commander. Bondovsky completed a machine gun instruction course under the army headquarters in 1916 and fought in the Battle of Riga, going on leave in late November 1917. Bondovsky served as a militsiya supervisor at the 3rd Militsiya Station in Penza beginning in February 1918. Drafted into the Red Army in July, he was appointed a company commander in the 3rd Rifle Regiment (later renumbered as the 246th) and with the 28th Rifle Division fought on the Eastern Front against the Orenburg Cossacks of Alexander Dutov and the forces of Alexander Kolchak. While serving as acting battalion commander in battle on 26 January 1919 at the village of Yepishino-Golukhino, west of Kungur, Bondovsky was wounded, and until July hospitalized at the Penza Evacuation Center. After recovering, he was appointed a platoon commander with the 3rd Machine Gun Commanders' Course at Penza, and with a cadet detachment from the course fought in the suppression of the uprising of Filipp Mironov in Saransk and Saratov Governorate. From September 1919 he served as detachment chief, assistant machine gun company commander, and machine gun company commander with the detachment of cadets drawn from the Penza and Kursk Commanders' Courses. Before the Orel‚ÄìKursk operation, the detachment joined the 80th Kursk Regiment of the 9th Rifle Division. In the latter, Bondovsky became a machine gun company commander. In the operation, he fought in battles against the Kornilov Division of the Volunteer Army. After the end of the offensive, the detachment returned to the courses and Bondovsky was appointed commander of a half-company of the course.  Interwar period  After the end of the war, Bondovsky served as a company commander with the 112th Infantry Commanders Course at Penza from December 1920, transferring to serve in the same position at the 19th Samara Infantry School in January 1923. After the disbandment of the school, he served in the same position with the Combined Muslim Commanders Courses, which were renamed the 6th Combined Kazan Tatar-Bashkir Commanders School in October. Bondovsky transferred to the 3rd Rifle Regiment of the 1st Kazan Rifle Division of the Volga Military District in December 1923, serving successively as a platoon and battalion commander and as assistant regimental commander for supply. Following his completion of the Vystrel course in 1926, he was appointed assistant commander for personnel of the 101st Rifle Regiment of the 34th Rifle Division at Syzran in December 1927 and in November 1929 transferred to take the same position with the 170th Rifle Regiment of the 57th Rifle Division at Sverdlovsk. Bondovsky became commander of the 193rd Rifle Regiment of the newly formed 65th Rifle Division at Tyumen in May 1931, transferring to Ishim in June 1932 to command the 311th Rifle Regiment of the division. For organizing successful combat and political training in the regiment, he was awarded the Order of the Red Star on 16 August 1936. Taking command of the 85th Rifle Division of the Ural Military District in August 1939, Bondovsky was promoted to kombrig on 4 November. His division, which was raised to wartime strength, was sent to the Northwestern Front to participate in the Winter War in January and February 1940, but did not arrive before the war ended. The 85th returned to the district and in June relocated to the area of Sebezh, then to Minsk, where it was assigned to the Western Special Military District. Bondovsky became a major general on 4 June when the Red Army introduced general officer ranks. The division eventually was placed under the direct control of the 3rd Army of the Western Front, in what was effectively the army reserve.  World War II  Actions in the vicinity of Grodno, 24‚Äì25 June 1941 When Operation Barbarossa began on 22 June, Bondovsky was at the division headquarters discussing ammunition resupply with his chief of artillery when he heard the sound of German bombs and the explosions that followed, though his headquarters and that of the army were unscathed. Later that day, he was summoned to the army headquarters to receive instructions for the defense of the line of the Lasosna from the mouth of the river to Gnevenizishchna, west of Grodno, which became the 3rd Army's rear position. Until 23 June the 85th defended these positions, then retreated to the line of the Neman and Svislach and further to Grodno. The division covered the retreat of the 11th Mechanized Corps towards Novogrudok and after battles against German troops crossing the Shchara retreated to the area of Venzovets and Dzyadlovo in the fighting, during which it was encircled. Avoiding the battle, the division bypassed Novogrudok from the southeast via Raytsa, Yeremechi, the Naliboki forest, and Rubeksevichi. They met units of the 21st Rifle Corps on 4 July and the Soviet commanders decided to attempt to breakout from the encirclement south of Minsk at Rudensk. From 5 July, the remnants of the 85th moved east towards Osipovichi and Smyk, then continued, splitting into small groups. Bondovsky attempted to organize resistance until realizing the futility of these efforts on 17 July, exchanging his uniform for civilian clothes with five others. They moved east on foot but were captured on 21 July near the village of Maleyevka; Bondovsky's rank was not noticed by the Germans. After five days being marched to the rear with a prisoner of war column, he slipped away at the village of Dubinka together with a lieutenant. From 16 September Bondovsky continued alone, and on 21 October he was again captured in the area of Koloshino while attempting to cross the Desna. Escaping the same night, he continued in the general direction of Novgorod- Seversky, Yampol, Glukhov, Rylsk, and Kursk. Bypassing these cities, on the night of 24 December Bondovsky reached Soviet lines in the sector of the 333rd Rifle Regiment of the 6th Rifle Division south of Dolgaya in the area of Kryukovo northeast of Kursk. An investigation by intelligence officers from the special section of the division did not find compromising evidence in Bondovsky's record, and as a result he was placed at the disposal of the Southwestern Front military council on 28 December, who were notified that he had been briefly captured. As officers who had escaped from captivity were suspected of being German agents, he did not initially receive a combat command and in early February was sent to the Main Personnel Directorate in Moscow. Bondovsky was assigned as a tactics instructor at the Vystrel course in April 1942 and in July became chief of a class of the course. In late November 1943 he returned to the front at his own request as deputy commander of the 121st Rifle Corps of the 50th Army in eastern Belarus, fighting in the Gomel‚ÄìRechitsa Offensive. Bondovsky became commander of the 324th Rifle Division in December, leading it in the battles for a bridgehead on the western bank of the Pronia, in which it fought in actions for the settlements of Dalnye Borki and Podlinovka. In early January 1944, after reaching the line of the Ukhlat in the area of Vetrinka and Somlitsa, the 324th went on the defensive. By 21 February, having handed over its sector, the division relocated to the east bank of the Dnieper in the area of Selets and Kholopeyev. On 23 February it crossed the Dnieper in the area of Adamenka south of Bykhov at the beginning of the Rogachev‚ÄìZhlobin Offensive. On the same day he was severely wounded during a German artillery bombardment while conducting reconnaissance, and lost his right leg. Bondovsky, who received the Order of the Red Banner for his leadership of the 324th, was evacuated to a hospital and after recovering in September returned to the Vystrel course as chief of a class, where he spent the rest of the war.  Postwar  After the end of the war Bondovsky continued in the same position until March 1946, when he became a senior tactics instructor at the course. From September 1946 he was chief of the military department at the Poltava Pedagogical Institute. Medically retired on 21 May 1947, Bondovsky died in Ivanovo on 15 March 1970. He was buried in a cemetery in that city.  Awards and honors  Bondovsky was a recipient of the following decorations: * Order of Lenin * Order of the Red Banner (2) * Order of the Red Star (2) * Medals * Honorary weapon A street in Grodno is named for him.

The app allows users to scan official QR codes at the premises of businesses and other organisations they visit, to create a digital diary. It was launched by New Zealand's Ministry of Health on 20 May 2020, during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It can be downloaded from the App Store and Google Play. History The NZ COVID Tracer app was developed for the Ministry of Health by New Zealand company Rush Digital and partially relies on an Amazon Web Services platform. It was formally launched on 20 May 2020. Some people were able to download it from App Store on 19 May and a Health Ministry spokesperson said later that it had been submitted to App Store and Google Play that evening and that there can be a variation in time between submitting an app and it going live. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern described the NZ COVID Tracer app as a \\"digital diary\\". It worked on mobile devices using Android 7.0 or above, and Apple iOS 12 or above, with future updates to include support for older systems. Immediately following its release, several users encountered difficulties with logging into the app or using it. There were also complaints from the public about iPhones and Android phones running the older, incompatible versions of operating systems being unable to download the app. The Ministry advised people without a compatible mobile device to keep a manual record of the people and places they have visited for contact tracing purposes. The app received an average rating of 2.6 on Google Play Store, with most complaints relating to its poor design and difficulty with finding the app. As of 20 May, more than 92,000 people had downloaded the app and over 1,000 businesses had signed up to it. On 12 June, Stuff reported that many businesses were finding the app clunky to use and had to rely upon secondary apps. A poll conducted on Neighbourly found that less that 37% of respondents had downloaded the COVID Tracer app due to privacy concerns, lack of access to a smartphone, and confusion about how to use it. By 17 June, the Ministry of Health reported that 562,000 people had registered with the COVID Tracer app. 56,552 posters displaying the official QR codes had been created. There have been 1,035,154 poster scans to date. The Ministry of Health released a new version of the app on 30 July 2020 that could be used on phones running Android 6 or iOS 11. Additionally, the update added the ability for users to manually enter location data for places they visit that do not have a QR code displayed. It became compulsory for businesses to display the official QR codes at their doors or reception areas from noon 19 August. By 18 August, more than 234,000 QR posters had been generated but not all clinics and retirement villages had displayed them. From 11:59 pm on 3 September, it became compulsory for all public transport providers, including buses, trains, ferries, ride-share vehicles and train operators, to provide the QR codes for passengers to use. As of 17 September, there are 2,228,300 registered users. Contact tracing The NZ COVID Tracer app allows users to scan official Ministry of Health QR codes at businesses, public buildings and other organisations to track where they have been, for contact tracing purposes. People can also register their contact tracing details on the official NZ COVID Tracer website. Information on people's movements will be stored for 60 days by the Ministry of Health securely on the user's device before being automatically deleted. Initially the period of retention for scan data was 31 days, however an update to the app on 9 September increased this to 60 days to make it easier for contact tracers to establish links between cases of COVID-19. First-time users are required to enter their name, phone number, email address and create a password. They will then receive a six digit code that allows them to complete the registration process. The app also allows users to store their contact details and physical address, which is provided to the National Close Contact Service (NCCS) in order to facilitate contact tracing in the event that the user is identified as a close contact of someone who has contracted COVID-19. The COVID Tracer app also supports two-factor authentication. While the NZ COVID Tracer app is currently only available in English, the New Zealand Government intends to include support for the MƒÅori, Chinese, and several unspecified Pacific languages. On 10 June, the Government announced that it would be updating the NZ COVID Tracer app to allow the app to contact users who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and giving them the option of voluntarily sending their location history to public health officials. Privacy and oversight The NZ COVID Tracer app was developed by the Ministry of Health in consultation with the Privacy Commissioner and has also undergone independent security testing. Any personal information and contact details registered on the Tracer app are provided to the National Close Contact Service. This information is retained for public health purposes only and is not shared with agencies outside the health sector. Any information entered through the Tracer app including the locations that users sign into is stored securely on the phone and automatically deleted after 60 days. Users have the right to share information with contact tracers.

The regular attempt by adversaries to deny one another freedom of movement on the battlefield can be observed throughout history . What makes anti-access/area-denial nowadays different from the past is the rapid improvement in military and communication technology in recent decades and new ways of implementing these strategies that such technology creates. Most scholarly attention seems to have gone to Chinese anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities, most likely because modern military technology is required to uphold A2/AD, it is almost always exclusively practiced by advanced regional powers like China. The A2/AD portfolio leverages diplomatic, information, military, and economic (DIME) activities. The focus of the Iranian A2/AD threat in the Strait of Hormuz is limited to the military dimension. Historically, A2/AD strategies have been employed by several different actors over time but they are particularly attractive when geography and/or political circumstances support them.. Most often, the force implementing A2/AD strategies is the strategically weaker force. That is, when implementing this strategy, one does not have to be the strongest force, just strong enough to prevent the other force from gaining access to the theater of operations they seek to conquer. A2/AD concepts have been presented interchangeably as asymmetric defensive and offensive measures restricting military freedom of movement of forces already into theatre, thereby utilizing attack aircraft, warships, and specialized ballistic and cruise missiles designed to strike key targets, which is anti-access, and denying the freedom of movement of forces already there, employing more defensive means, that is area denial. Conceptualizations vary in their scope or their focus either on the strategic or operational level.  The A2/AD Threat in the Strait of Hormuz  A decisive factor in A2/AD strategies is geography. However, a specific geography is not a necessary component of an A2/AD strategy, it can prove helpful for particular operations on land and sea as geographical chokepoints and difficult terrain provide favorable opportunities for A2/AD operations.maritime chokepoints lend themselves well into anti-access measures and make it easier to implement area denial strategies. An anti- access strategy is easiest to implement when there are limited ways to reach the target under the best circumstances. In littoral areas within a few hundred miles of the coast, like the Strait of Hormuz, there are a number of A2/AD capabilities forces could make use of. For instance, Krepinevich concept of A2/AD is to describe the threat posed by long-range missile systems, precision munitions, and satellite technology that will make military operations in the littoral areas challenging for naval forces. Demonstrated or available A2/AD systems include over-the- horizon targeting systems, long-range strike aircraft, anti-ship cruise missiles and in some way ballistic missiles, submarines and missile-firing surface combatants, swarming fast attack craft, mines, and coastal defense artillery. Additionally, integrated air defenses seek to prevent naval strike aircraft, aerial delivery platforms, and land-attack cruise missiles. Iran holds an advantageous geographic position at the Strait of Hormuz that allows it to control the northern shore of the maritime chokepoint. Iran‚Äôs enviable geographic position astride the Strait gives it a range of options for delaying movements through the Strait. The geographical features of the Persian Gulf region combined with Iran‚Äôs weakness in a direct military competition with a considerably stronger force suggests that Iran will pursue an asymmetric hybrid A2/AD strategy that mixes advanced technology with guerilla tactics to deny the foreign forces access and freedom of maneuver. The Iranian military complex includes a variety of weapons that could be used to deny access to the Persian Gulf. It includes ballistic missiles that can reach targets across the Persian Gulf region, anti-ship cruise missiles, a variety of mines, fast attack craft, and other advanced weaponry to exert their control over the Strait of Hormuz. Iran might pursue an A2/AD strategy suited to its relatively modest resources and geographic and geostrategic attributes of the region. Teheran would seek to impose costs on a foreign force by using a layered approach that begins with offensive strikes over long ranges and culminates with defenses that increase in intensity with a foreign forces approach. An Iranian military campaign, attempting to sabotage or block the passage would depend on its ability to coordinate the use of mines, anti- ship cruise missiles, and air defense to create a littoral trap for any intervening force. Iran would start by laying minefields in and around the Strait's shipping channels, as well as using anti-ship cruise missiles against merchant traffic and any foreign force mine countermeasure and convoy vessels. The geography of the waterway plays an important role for the Iranian Navy and Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy to exploit its features for their A2/AD strategy. The Strait provides a very narrow entrance to the Persian Gulf. It is approximately 180-kilometer- long and at its narrowest point 40 kilometers wide and probably no more than 60 meters at its deepest. It contains two shipping lanes for large vessels, each 3.2 km wide, with a 3.2-kilometer- wide buffer zone between them. The northern channel is within only a few dozen kilometers of the Iranian coast. For Teheran‚Äôs navies that means that they would benefit from very short lines of communications. The proximity of the Strait of Hormuz to major Iranian port facilities, such as Bandar Abbas, would permit Iran‚Äôs large inventory of small boats, fast attack craft, and fast inshore attack craft equipped with naval mines to rapidly engage or disengage from maritime exclusion operations. Iran has developed a guerilla warfare strategy intended to exploit the perceived weaknesses of traditional naval forces that rely on large vessels. Furthermore, the geography of the waterway enables Iran to use smart mines, small boats swarming attacks, short-range unmanned aerial vehicles, and shore-based anti-ship missiles to deny military and civilian vessels safe passage. The Gulf's acoustic conditions and relative shallowness may also degrade anti-submarine warfare. = Iranian Mine Warfare = Naval mines are essentially a defensive weapon employed for access denial where their operator is seeking to manipulate the movement of enemy forces by restricting access to critical spaces. Mine warfare plays a crucial part in the Iranian A2/AD strategy. By deploying mines, the Iranians intend to slow and disrupt the movement of maritime forces operating in the Strait‚Äôs relatively restricted waters, making ships easier to target. Iran is believed to possess around 6000 mines. It is one of two dozen nations that can manufacture mines domestically. Naval mines can be adapted for use against specific target sets ‚Äì different types of naval mine are defined according to their actuation triggers. Different types are defined according to their actuation triggers and the position in the water they are designed to be laid. Iran possesses or produces bottom-moored contact mines (which were used extensively during the Tanker War), moored and bottom-influence mines incorporating magnetic, acoustic, and pressure fuses, limpet mines, drifting mines, and remotely controlled mines. Iran might deploy its less sophisticated mines from a variety of surface vessels, while it reserves its submarine force to lay influence mines covertly. The primary goal is to deny passage and force foreign forces to engage in prolonged mine countermeasure operations while under threat from Iranian shore-based attacks . The ability of Iranian forces to rapidly deploy mines depends in variables related to its minelaying platforms. For the types of mines, Iran possesses, submarines represent the best mine-laying platforms using high-speed small boats. Besides small speedboats and submarines, nondescript civilian vessels manned by military crews to covertly mine shipping corridors and harbor entrances, would additionally be used as minelaying platforms. = Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles in the Strait of Hormuz = Iran possesses a large number of shore-, ship-based, and air-launched anti-ship missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles. These assets include shore batteries of anti-ship cruise missiles near the Strait, along its coast and on its islands in the Gulf, many of which are on mobile launchers. Many of Iran‚Äôs missiles can be deployed on the smaller, harder to detect, and more expendable ships and boats, some could be remotely targeted by maritime patrol aircraft or unmanned aerial vehicles. While many of its missiles are relatively short- ranged, the Strait of Hormuz is only 40 km wide at its narrowest point, and Iran has many islands near the shipping channels. Smaller ships and boats are harder to detect by radar, and Iran might mount some missiles on commercial ships ‚Äì a tactic it has practiced with other types of missiles. Iran‚Äôs primary naval platforms for delivering anti-ship cruise missiles are its fast missile boats. Nevertheless, Iran may have put some of its missiles on relatively vulnerable platforms such as inland truck-mounted batteries . The maximum effective range of Iran‚Äôs anti-ship cruise missiles may be limited more by their target acquisition radars than their onboard fuel capacity and suggest that in keeping with its asymmetric maritime strategy, Iran could use target data from submarines, small military and civilian vessels, and unmanned aerial vehicles, under the condition that these platforms have precision navigation and the ability to communicate with shore- based anti-ship cruise missile batteries . Iran would deploy its land-based ASCM from camouflaged and hardened sites to firing positions along its coastline and on Iranian-occupied islands in the Strait of Hormuz while placing decoys at false firing positions to complicate countermeasures. Although Iran‚Äôs long- range coastal artillery and shore-based anti-ship missiles can provide some level of area denial over substantial parts of the Strait, surface vessels are required to control the Gulf. However, significant uncertainties exist regarding the types, numbers, and performance characteristics of missiles in Iran‚Äôs inventory; how many mobile launchers; how they are located across naval versus land-based or air-based platforms. = Air Defense over Iran = Air defense systems are yet another part of Iran‚Äôs multi-layered A2/AD complex in the Strait of Hormuz. Iran‚Äôs most effective and efficient means of defending its airspace are land-based air defense systems. As with much of its military equipment, Iran‚Äôs air defense network is a mix of older Western and newer, generally Russian-designed, systems. Iran's ability to defend its airspace with fighter aircraft is limited. Iranian land-based air defense capabilities pose a more persistent threat. Iran has devoted considerable resources and attention to its land- based air defenses in recent years. Iran operates a diverse array of surface- to-air missiles and radar systems intended to defend critical sites from attack by a technologically superior air force.Iranian air defenses are a central element of its deterrent capabilities. It enhances the freedom of action of its own air and naval forces, and its offensive capabilities. When confronted with highly-developed air forces and lacking a capable air force of its own, Iran has chosen to deny its enemies the ability to achieve air superiority through its use of ground-based air defenses The common denominator in the debate surrounding Iran‚Äôs air defense capabilities is, that, massed together, Iran‚Äôs air defenses provide Teheran with a degree of deterrence because they increase the difficulty, expense and time to launch air attacks on Iran and with that Iran could potentially place an A2/AD umbrella over the Strait of Hormuz. However, Iran surface-to-air missile and radar systems show deficiencies that make them vulnerable to concerted actions by foreign powers. For example, considering the country's size and the number of sites Iran presumably wants to defend, the numbers are relatively low.. Another deficiency manifests itself in the monitoring and communication structure, that Iran has at its disposal to bring different areas and points together to an integrated air defense system  References  Category:Strait of Hormuz Category:Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force Category:Naval mines ","title":"Iranian anti-access and area denial strategy in the Strait of Hormuz"},{"id":"64013419","title":"Octanol-water partition coefficient"},{"id":"64013466","text":"Leopoldo Ruiz y Fl√≥res (13 November 1865 ‚Äì 12 December 1941) was a Mexican prelate of the Catholic Church who served as Archbishop of Morelia from 1911 until his death in 1941. He was previously Bishop of L√©on from 1900 to 1907 and Archbishop of Linares o Nueva Le√≥n from 1907 to 1911. During the Church- state negotiations following the Cristero War, he represented the Holy See as its Apostolic Delegate to Mexico. He was sent into exile in 1932 in reprisal for a sharp critique of the Mexican government by Pope Pius XI and returned in 1938. Biography Leopoldo Ruiz y Fl√≥res was born on 13 November 1865 in Amealco, Mexico. He was ordained a priest on 17 March 1888. On 12 November 1900, Pope Leo XIII appointed him Bishop of L√©on. He received his episcopal consecration on 27 December 1900. On 14 September 1907, Pope named him Archbishop of Linares o Nueva Le√≥n. On 27 November 1911, Pope Pius X named him Archbishop of Michoac√°n. (The name of that archdiocese changed to the Archdiocese of Morelia on 22 November 1924.) He was appointed Apostolic Delegate to Mexico on 10 October 1929 by Pope Pius XI. The Cristero War, a rebellion against the government's suppression of the Catholic Church, was ending, but years of conflict about its resolution followed. In his new role, Ruiz led the Mexican bishops into alignment with Pope Pius, who opposed the rebellion but struggled with the government's ongoing anti-clericalism. Ruiz represented the Church in difficult negotiations with the government while contending with instructions and pronouncements from Rome. The situation worsened when Pope Pius issued an encyclical, Acerba animi, on 29 September 1932 that denounced the government for reneging on earlier agreements. Ruiz had always been a moderate in tone and posture, but as the Vatican's representative became the target of the government's response. On 3 October 1932, the Chamber of Deputies voted him into exile. He based himself nearby in San Antonio, Texas. Under pressure from Rome he resigned as Apostolic Delegate and then returned to Mexico in 1938. He was still Archbishop of Morelia when he died on 12 December 1941 at the age of 76.

The annual Ramapir Mela festival is the second largest Hindu pilgrimage in Pakistan, after the annual Hinglaj yatra which is the largest Hindu pilgrimage in Pakistan Legend The temple was built in 1859, three and a half centuries after the demise of Ramdev Pir in 1459 AD. According to a legend, a Hindu man in Tando Allahyar took a vow that if he was blessed with a child, he will arrange a Mela (fair) of Rama Pir in Tando Allahyar. As his wish was fulfilled, he brought an earthen lamp from the original temple of Rama Pir in Ramdevra in India to Tando Allahyar in Pakistan and built a temple here. In the mela carrying \\"Dajja\\" (flags) in their hands, they recite \\"Bhajans\\" whole night sitting outside the city and early in the morning at 5:00AM they hoist \\"Dajja\\" at the temple by dancing on the beat of drums and trumpets. Thousands of devotees, including man, women and children, traveled on foot to pay homage to Rama Pir. They had brought flags which were hoisted at the temple. Although Ramdev alias Rama Pir, a Hindu saint of 19th century, was cremated in Rajasthan, but he had come to Tando Allahyar and his devotees had constructed a temple in his memory at the place where he had worshiped as far back as 1800. Since then, a fair is held at the Rama Pir temple by his devotees every year. Rampir Mela Dajjah(flag) in the temple The annual Ramapir Mela occurs in 3 days.

The stadium will be the permanent home of Prva HNL side NK Osijek, replacing its current home, the Gradski Vrt Stadium. It is set to be completed in June 2021 and will have a capacity of 12,850. The precinct will also act as the training base of NK Osijek, with seven football pitches adjoining the stadium. The stadium will have a roof covering all of the seats and be in close proximity to the pitch. It will be located alongside the Drava river. The cost is estimated at ‚Ç¨50 million, financed by NK Osijek with a grant from the Hungarian Government.  History  Aerial view on the construction site from the northwest, June 2020 External view on the construction site from the northeast, July 2020 The project was officially announced on 19 April 2018, in the famous Osijek movie theather \\"Urania\\", by the former president of the club and the current president of the NK Osijek Football Academy, Ivan Me≈°troviƒá. Early enabling works on the site began in late 2018, when vegetating clearing was carried out. The plot was raised by 1.5 meter through additional landfill. With the site spanning 15.3 hectares, this represented thousands of truckloads. In April 2020, within a month, 1,000 piles (each 12 meters deep) were inserted into the ground, ensuring future stability of the stadium. In November 2019, the most famous NK Osijek player and current Croatian Football Federation president Davor ≈†uker announced a symbolic ‚Ç¨1 million contribution from the federation to the project.  Specifications  The size of the precinct will be 15.3 hectares. There will be 750 parking spaces available to the public and 150 VIP parking spaces. It will be a Category 4 UEFA stadium. Boxes in the West Stand will include beds, saunas, and jacuzzis, whilst the adjoining camp will have a hotel, seven heated pitches and entertainment facilities for players. The stadium will have a capacity of 12,850 which will be able to be extended to 15,000 and will be the first all-covered stadium in the country. Roughly 550 seats would be of higher standard, of which 100 spread across 7 skyboxes. The roof (188x150m) will stretch outside the stadium, ensuring shade or rain protection and making it a more friendly public area. Hovering 22.5 meters above ground, it will be the landmark element. The stadium's facade will be translucent, ensuring sufficient sunlight access by day to facilities beneath the stands. Divided into 12 horizontal rings, the facade would be illuminated in varying colours, making the stadium attractive by night.

It is a vigorous annual, and is an invasive species in South America and Madagascar. It reaches heights of up to 1 m and is primarily recognized by the ridged surface of its sessile spikelet‚Äôs lower glume. Despite its historic importance as fodder in Asia, the grass has become a major weed in mid- latitude rice paddies throughout Asia and South America. Description Ischaemum rugosum is a resilient annual that inhabits marshes and other wet habitats, growing in loose clumps to heights of 10‚Äì100 cm. The species is primarily recognized by the wrinkled texture of the sessile spikelet‚Äôs lower glume, with 4‚Äì7 distinct horizontal ribs. The plant produces brown, ovoid grains 2 mm long. The culms are wrapped by a papery, loose leaf sheath up to 16 cm long, with bulbous-based hairs at the node base and sheath margin. Sheaths are topped with a membranous ligule 6 mm deep. The linear leaf blades are 5‚Äì30 cm long and 3‚Äì15 mm wide, gradually tapering down at the base and sometimes resembling a petiole. Blades have a margin of stiff minute hairs, and may either be smooth or covered with thin hairs on the leaf surface. The inflorescence may be terminal or axillary, and is composed of two racemes, tightly back to back, and typically 3‚Äì12 cm long. Spikelets on each raceme are in pairs; one spikelet is fertile and sessile, and the other is sterile and pedicelled. Sessile spikelets are 4‚Äì6 mm long and contain two florets, one sterile and one fertile; the pair lack a rachilla extension between them. The awn of the upper lemma reaches up to 2 cm. Glumes are unalike; the lower glume is ovate with a ridged, convex surface, and the upper is thinner and boat- shaped. The pedicelled spikelets may be highly reduced or well-developed, and are at least as long as the sessile spikelets, or shorter (2‚Äì6 mm long). The pedicel is typically 1 mm long and stout, and spikelet‚Äôs lemmas are usually empty and awnless. The glumes are papery, and ovate to pointed with a blunt apex. Etymology The genus Ischaemum L. takes its name from the Latin ischaemon (Greek ischo ‚Äúto restrain‚Äù and haima ‚Äúblood‚Äù), as recorded by Pliny the Elder to describe an herb used to stop bleeding. As circumscribed by Linnaeus, the genus contained some species whose seeds had been known to have styptic properties, and so the name was inherited. The specific epithet rugosum authored by Salisbury is derived from the Latin rugosus ‚Äúwrinkled‚Äù, and refers to the wrinkled lower glumes on the sessile spikelets. Habitat and ecology The species grows in water, wet grasslands, moist river banks, and drainage ditches, and is important to grazing animals in the regions to which it is native. It‚Äôs vigorous nature gives it a high invasive potential, and it is a well-known agricultural weed throughout the moist tropics. Within the optimum temperature range of germination from 20‚Äì30 ¬∞C, a 2015 study observed a 97.5% germination rate in lab conditions, which attests to its competitiveness as an invasive species. However, germination is restricted to sufficiently moist soil, and completely inhibited in darkness, which may inform future directions in weed management. Distribution Ischaemum rugosum occupies a wide native distribution in tropical and temperate regions of Asia, Africa, and Oceania. However, it has extended its range as an invasive species within the mid-latitudes of Latin America. Taxonomy and systematics Taxonomists recognize five sections within the genus Ischaemum, placing Ischaemum rugosum within the section Aristata (recognized by a rugose lower glume and awnless upper glume on the sessile spikelet). The species was first described formally by the British botanist Richard Anthony Salisbury in 1791, in his publication Icones Stirpium Rariorum Descriptionibus Illustratae. Symptomatic of its extensive distribution, the species has accumulated 20 synonyms across 7 genera; however, as presently recognized, the species adopts Salisbury‚Äôs original classification. Since the species inhabits such a wide native range from tropical Africa to southern Asia, it goes by a myriad of regional names as well (e.g. fovo in Sierra Leone, amarkarh in parts of India, m√¥m u in Vietnam, and ka-gyi-the-myet in Myanmar). Ischaemum rugosum belongs to Poaceae (Graminae), an economically important group and the fifth largest Angiosperm family (with 11,506 species). The genus Ischaemum has undergone several iterations of supergeneric classification within the tribe Andropogoneae, in the subfamily Panicoideae; these disagreements owe largely to the high degree of variation over a morphological continuum in Andropogoneae, which has made it a challenge to circumscribe monophyletic subdivisions. Early molecular phylogenetic revisions of the Andropogoneae suggested its major lineages arose from a rapid evolutionary radiation, in which such case the circumscription of well-supported subtribes would be difficult, if not arbitrary. However, the most recent synthesis of morphological and molecular data presents a phylogenetic classification that recognizes the genus Ischaemum within subfamily Panicoideae, supertribe Andropogonodae, tribe Andropogoneae, subtribe Ischaeminae. Several previously recognized varieties have been reduced to synonymy. In agriculture Besides the grain occasionally being used as food, the species has historically been economically important as forage for horses and cattle, and harvested as hay. However, its greatest economic impact has been as a noxious weed in vegetable and rice fields in countries including India, Thailand, Ghana, Brazil, Venezuela, and Malaysia. A study in India reported that an outbreak of Ischaemum rugosum can reduce a rice paddy yield by up to 69.4%. One challenge is that the young shoots of the plant resemble the rice growing in the fields. But a greater concern is that over the past several decades, it has evolved resistance to several commonly used herbicides. Presently, the most effective weed management strategies recognized are cultural methods, such as mulching with rice residue and shallow tillage.

Hong Kong and Dubai. After winning three minor races as a juvenile in 2001 she emerged as a top-class performer in the following year, winning the Prix de Diane and Prix de l'Op√©ra as well as running second in the Prix Saint-Alary and third in the Prix Vermeille. In 2003 she added a third Group 1 success in the Prix d'Astarte and was placed in the Prix d'Ispahan, Prix du Moulin and Prix de l'Op√©ra. She was retired from racing after two unsuccessful starts as a five-year-old. As a broodmare she produced several minor winners. Background Bright Sky is a chestnut mare with white star and a white sock on her left hind leg bred in Ireland by Dayton Investments, the breeding company of her owner Daniel Wildenstein. After Wildenstein's death in October 2001 the filly was owned by the executors of his estate before passing into the ownership of Ecurie Wildenstein in 2002. She was sent into training with Jean-Marie B√©guign√© at Chantilly in France and was ridden in most of her races by Dominique Boeuf. She was the most successful horse sired by Wolfhound an American-bred sprinter who won the Prix de la For√™t in 1992 and the Haydock Sprint Cup in 1993. Bright Sky's dam Bright Moon was a top-class racemare who won the Prix de Pomone in 1993 and 1994. She was descended from the influential French broodmare La Troienne. Racing career2001: two-year- old season= On her racecourse debut, Bright Sky started 2/1 favourite for a maiden race over 1400 metres on soft ground at Clairefontaine Racecourse on 22 July and won by a length from Ana Marie. After finishing fifth behind Melody Blue in a race over 1600 metres at Chantilly Racecourse in August she recorded a five length victory in a minor event over 1800 metres on heavy ground at Longchamp Racecourse on 21 October. In November the filly ended her season by winning the Prix Belle Sicambre over the same distance at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse coming home four lengths clear of her seven opponents. =2002: three-year-old season= Bright Sky began her second season with a step up in class for the Listed Prix Finlande over 1800 metres at Longchamp on 7 April and ran second, beaten three quarters of a length by Turtle Bow. In the Group 3 Prix Vanteaux over the same course and distance three weeks later she finished strongly but failed by a short head to overhaul Ana Marie. At the same track on 19 May the filly started 2.2/1 favourite (coupled with her stablemate Atlantique) in the Group 1 Prix Saint-Alary over 2000 metres. After being restrained towards the rear of the field she produced a sustained run on the outside but was beaten a neck into second place by the outsider Marotta. Despite finishing runner-up in her last three starts Bright Sky started 3/1 favourite for the Prix de Diane over 2100 metres at Chantilly on 9 June. Her fourteen opponents included Marotta, Ana Marie, Turtle Bow (Prix Cl√©op√¢tre), Dance Routine (Prix de Royaumont), Music Club (Prix Melisande), Monturani (Fillies' Trial Stakes), Ombre Legere (Prix Penelope) and Summertime Legacy (Prix des R√©servoirs). Bright Sky was held up by Boeuf in the early stages, as her stablemate Blue Lightning set the pace, and was still in last place exiting the final turn. She then made rapid progress in the straight, producing what was described as a \\"devastating burst of acceleration\\" to overtake Turtle Bow 150 metres from the finish and win by two lengths from Dance Routine. Turtle Bow finished third but was relegated to fourth behind Ana Marie for causing interference. After a three-month break Bright Sky was stepped up in distance for the Prix Vermeille over 2400 metres at Longchamp on 15 September and came home third of the eleven runners behind Pearly Shells and Ana Marie. She was then dropped back in trip for the 2000 metres Prix de l'Op√©ra at Longchamp on 6 October when she was accompanied by her pacemaker Blue Lightning and started the 0.9/1 favourite in a twelve-runner field. Her opponents for the Group 1 prize included Quarter Moon, Irresistible Jewel (Ribblesdale Stakes), Marotta, Serisia (Prix de Psych√©), Walzerkoenigin (Prix Chlo√©) and Golden Silca (Mill Reef Stakes). Blue Lightning set the pace with Bright Sky settling at the rear of the field before producing her customary stretch run. She gained the advantage from Irresistible Jewel 200 metres from the finish and drew away to win in \\"impressive\\" style by four lengths. For her final race of 2002 Bright Sky was sent to Japan to contest the Japan Cup which was run that year over 2200 metres at Nakayama Racecourse on 24 November. Ridden by Thierry Thulliez she was never in contention and came home thirteenth of the sixteen runners, nine and a half lengths behind the winner Falbrav. =2003: four-year-old season= On her first appearance as a four- year-old Bright Sky started 1.4/1 favourite for the Prix Ganay over 2000 metres at Longchamp on 18 May but despite staying on well in the straight she was beaten a length and a half into second place by Falbrav. After a lengthy absence from the track the filly returned on 3 August to contest the Group 1 Prix d'Astarte over 1600 metres at Deauville Racecourse and went off the 4.9/1 third choice in the betting behind the three-year-olds Six Perfections and Acago (Prix Chlo√©). The rest of the twelve-runner field included Musical Chimes (Poule d'Essai des Poulains), Campsie Fells (Prix Vanteaux) and Diacada (Henckel-Rennen). Bright Sky raced in mid-division before making progress entering the last 300 metres and ran down Six Perfections in the final strides to win by a neck. Boeuf commented: \\"I was a little worried when Six Perfections went for home, because we all know how good she is. However, Bright Sky responded magnificently. It was a calculated risk bringing the filly back in trip, and her preparations have been geared accordingly.\\" At Longchamp on 3 September Bright Sky started 2/1 favourite for the Prix du Moulin and kept on well after being briefly outpaced in the straight to finish third behind Nebraska Tornado and the Japanese challenger Lohengrin. On 5 October Bright Sky started favourite as attempted to repeat her 2002 victory in the Prix de l'Op√©ra but despite taking the lead 300 metres from the finish she was overtaken in the final strides and beaten a neck and a head into third place by Zee Zee Top and Yesterday. Three weeks later the filly was sent to California to contest the Breeders' Cup Turf at Santa Anita Park and came home sixth of the eight runners behind the dead heaters High Chaparral and Johar. She ended her season in December at Sha Tin Racecourse when she finished fourth behind her old rival Falbrav in the Hong Kong Cup. =2004: five-year- old season= Bright Sky remained in training as a five-year-old and made her seasonal debut in the Prix Exbury at Saint-Cloud on 6 March. She started favourite and took the lead in the final stages only to be caught on the line and beaten a short head by the seven-year-old Polish Summer. Three weeks later she was sent to the United Arab Emirates to contest the Dubai Duty Free Stakes at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse and came home seventh of the eleven runners behind Paolini, beaten two and a half lengths by the German-trained winner. Breeding record At the end of her racing career Bright Sky was retired to become a broodmare for Dayton Investments (now owned by the Wildenstein family). She produced at least eight foals and three winners: *Bright Style, a bay filly, foaled in 2005, sired by Fasliyev. Failed to win in two races. *Blagueuse, bay filly, 2007, by Statue of Liberty. Won two races. *Blue Picture, chestnut filly, 2008, by Peintre Celebre. Failed to win in two races. *Best of All, bay filly, 2009, by Dylan Thomas.

She and four similar ferries, Lady Chelmsford (1910), Lady Denman (1912), Lady Ferguson (1914), Lady Scott (1914) were a new series of \\"Lady-class\\", designed by renowned naval architect, Walter Reeks. Lady Edeline and her four sisters survived the 1932 opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and were converted to diesel power that decade. They also survived the 1951 NSW State Government takeover of the ailing ferry fleet. She was taken out of service in 1984 following the sinking of fellow old wooden ferry, Karrabee earlier that year. She was laid up on the Parramatta River where she settled into the mud in 1988 and was broken up. Lady Edeline was the longest serving of the five sisters, and the last wooden ferry run by the government service. Continuing a Balmain Ferry Co convention of naming their ferries after the wives of Governors-General of Australia and Governors of NSW, Lady Edeline was named after Lady Edeline Strickland, wife of New South Wales governor, Sir Gerald Strickland. This naming nomenclature was again used by the State Government harbour ferry operator with the introduction of 6 new \\"Lady-class ferries\\" in the 1960s and 1970s. Design and construction In common with most Sydney Harbour ferries at the time, Lady Edeline and her four sisters were wooden double-ended screw steamers. The five ferries had only a single propeller at one end that pushed the vessels in one direction and pulled them in the other. This feature was introduced by the ferry's designer, Walter Reeks, on a previous Balmain company ferry, Lady Rawson of 1906. The configuration contrasted with the double-ended vessels of Sydney Ferries Limited (the K-class ferries) which had a continuous propeller shaft and a screw at each end. A single propeller and one shaft simplified the internal arrangements and put less stress on the timber hulls compared to shafts running a propeller at either end. Apart from some unusual handling characteristics, the single-propeller configuration was a success and Reeks unsuccessfully tried to patent it. Lady Edeline was built by G A Washington of Balmain. Her sisters were by various builders; Lady Chelmsford (1910) was built by Brisbane Waters shipbuilder Rock Davis, Lady Denman (1912) and Lady Scott (1914) were built by Joseph Dent of Jervis Bay and Lady Ferguson (1914) by David Drake of Balmain. With construction of a Sydney Harbour Bridge seeming likely, she and her four sisters were designed for a maximum of fifteen years of life. Instead, the five would serve on the harbour for at least 60 years, with Lady Edeline operating until 1985. Because she was intended to have a limited life-span, she was lightly built and almost austere in her fittings, such as her roof of galvanised iron. The five were relatively small and had a veed shape and shallow draft to navigate the muddy and silted upper reaches of their upstream runs.Ferries of Sydney Lady Edeline's machinery was supplied by Pollock. The 28 hp steam compound steam engines could push her to 11 knots. Service history From 1900, the Balmain New Ferry Company began a period of expansion to keep up and compete with the tram network expanding into what is now referred to as Sydney's Inner West. Older ferries were sold off including several series of \\"Lady-class\\" class ferries were introduced. Lady Edeline was the third of five in the Balmain company's final series of \\"Lady-class\\" ferries, the others being Ladies Chelmsford (1910), Denman (1912), Scott (1914), and Ferguson (1914). This series was introduced to replace the single-ended ferries on the Lane Cove River service. They also worked on the run from Balmain to Erskine Street wharf (at site of current Barangaroo). Lady Edeline, and the rest of the Balmain fleet, were bought by Sydney Ferries Limited as part of its take over of the Balmain company on 1 March 1918. The five operated the Lane Cove River services to Fig Tree until 12 November 1931 when weekday services were suspended. They ran weekend services to Fig Tree on weekends until 2 September 1945. Lane Cove River services were discontinued altogether on 10 November 1950, after which the five saw them work the Parramatta River and across other routes. Sydney Ferries ran a service to Balmain until it was taken over in 1939 by Nicholson Brothers Harbour Transport Company with their own ferries. The five \\"Lady class\\" ferries were run on other routes across the Harbour. At Greenwich in the 1960s as a diesel in her 1936 colour scheme In 1932, the Sydney Harbour Bridge was opened, and Sydney Ferries Ltd's annual patronage dropped from 40 million to about 15 million. As part of economy measures, almost older and/or larger steamers were put up for sale, and the five \\"Lady-class\\" ferries were converted to diesel power in the 1930s with Lady Chelmsford first. Their tall black smoke stacks were replaced with short funnels. Facing uncertain times, Sydney Ferries Ltd sought a refreshed look for their ferries, painting over the original livery of varnished timber and white trim with a scheme of yellow and green with a red trim. In 1936, Lady Edeline re-entered service with a six-cylinder 228 bhp Gardner diesel that pushed her to 10 knots. The five \\"Lady\\" ferries continued to run the Hunters Hill and Balmain services. The post-Bridge drop in demand for the ferry fleet was somewhat mitigated as many could not afford their own transport in the Great Depression of the 1930s and rationing of fuel during World War 2 made the coal required for the steam ferries relatively cheap.Kirawa on ferriesofsydney.com However, the post World War II years saw the drop in demand pick up pace. In 1951, with annual patronage down to 9 million, the NSW State Government took over Sydney Ferries Limited and its remaining fleet and assets. The ferries became assets of the Sydney Harbour Transport Board and the Port Jackson and Manly Steamship Company, which ran the Manly service, was paid to run the services. The services and fleet were quickly rationalised with most of the larger remaining timber K-class steamers being decommissioned. The five relatively small and economical \\"Lady-class\\" ferries, however, were retained. Throughout the remainder of the 1950s and into the 1960s, they became the back-bone of Sydney Harbour's non-Manly ferry fleet, along with Karginal and Karrabee the smallest of the K-class ferries. Their routes were expanded to all inner-harbour (ie, non-Manly) services including Taronga Park Zoo, Milsons Point, Cremorne and Hunters Hill. The five sister ferries (except Lady Scott) were re-engined again in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Lady Edeline's 1936 Gardner diesel was replaced by a 300 bhp 4-cylinder Crossley Brothers diesel in 1963. In the 1960s, the Board updated the 1930s green and gold livery to a more muted cream and khaki scheme. In 1974, the board became the Public Transport Commission (PTC) and a royal blue and white scheme was adopted for all the ferries.

Lady Chelmsford, the first built of the five, was sold in 1969 and rebuilt as a show boat in Adelaide. She was sold to Melbourne interests in 1985 where she was used as a cruise boat. She sank at her moorings in 2008 and was broken up in 2011. By the 1970s, Lady Ferguson was being used as a spare ferry on Sydney Harbour. She was towed to Hobart with Kosciusko in 1975 to assist following the collapse of the Tasman Bridge however she was found to be in too poor condition and was scrapped. Lady Denman was pulled from ferry service in 1979 following the introduction that year of the new Lady Street. She is now on permanent land display at Huskisson on the New South Wales south coast and of the original five, is the only extant vessel. Following the high- profile sinking of Karrabee in January 1984, the remaining wooden ferries, namely, Kameruka, Karingal and Lady Edeline, were removed from service later that year with Lady Edeline being the last. The same year, the first of nine First Fleet-class ferries were put into service. Lady Edeline was laid up on the Parramatta River near the Mortlake Punt. She sank into the mud in 1988 following heavy rain. Her superstructure was removed but her hull can be seen in low tide.

Aux origines du marxisme arm√©nien : Les sp√©cifistes. In: Cahiers du monde russe et sovi√©tique, vol. 19, n¬∞1-2, Janvier-Juin 1978. Le Caucase. p. 67-117 The S.D.B.H.K. was founded in Baku in October 1903 by a group of Armenians who had become Marxists during studies in Germany or Switzerland, as well as a few ex- Dashnaks, ex-Hunchak intellectuals and others. The group was, in particular, dissatisfied with the outcome of the 2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. The S.D.B.H.K. was seeking to building trade unions among Armenian workers along similar lines as how the General Jewish Labour Bund functioned. Like the General Jewish Labour Bund, the S.D.B.H.K. argued towards the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks to allow authonomous ethnic organizations within the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. The organization argued that the situation 'specific' conditions applied in Transcaucasia, especially in Armenian-dominated areas and that these areas needed a special agrarian program. Key ideologues of the S.D.B.H.K. included Bakhshi Ishkhanyan, A. Rubeni (who later joined the Bolsheviks), Ghazar Der Ghazarian, Nariman Der Ghazarian, T. Isakhanyan, E. Palyan G. Kuzikyan (Yesalim), D. Ter-Danielyan (Davit Ananoun).Soviet Armenian Encyclopedia. ’ç’à’ë‘ª‘±‘º-‘¥‘µ’Ñ’à‘ø’ê‘±’è‘±‘ø‘±’Ü ‘≤‘±’Ü’é’à’ê‘±‘ø‘±’Ü ’Ä‘±’Ö ‘ø‘±‘∂’Ñ‘±‘ø‘µ’ê’ä’à’í‘π’Ö’à’í’Ü ’ç‘¥‘≤’Ä‘ø In its early phase, the small organization began agitations among workers and students, and began publishing leaflets and brochures for mass distribution. The S.D.B.H.K. distributed its propaganda in and around Baku (mobilizing workers in Balakhani, Bibi-Eybat and Black Town) as well as in Batumi, Tiflis, and in the country-side of Karabakh. On May 1, 1904 S.D.B.H.K. organized a strike of 4,000-5,000 Armenian workers in Balakhani. The Armenian Social-Democratic Workers Organization concentrated its efforts in labour organizing, leading some thirty strikes between 1906 and 1917. It claimed to have some 2,000 workers organized in its unions. The organization had influence among Armenian workers in Baku, Tiflis and Batumi. The S.D.B.H.K. favoured a system of broad local government and national-cultural autonomy within Russia. In 1904 its main organ was Sotsiyalist ('Socialist') issued from Baku, which later relocated to Geneva and continued publishing there 1905-1906. In January 1905 the S.D.B.H.K. was invited to a conference of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, the General Jewish Labour Bund, the Social Democracy in the Latvian Territory and the Revolutionary Ukrainian Party. S.D.B.H.K. had expressed its intention to send a delegation for the conference, but did not attend in the end. The S.D.B.H.K. received fierce criticisms from the other social democratic factions in the Caucasus, both the Bolsheviks (Stalin and Stepan Shaumian) and Mensheviks ( and Noe Zhordania). Ahead of the 3rd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1905, both the Menshevik leader Zhordania and the Bolshevik leader Lenin argued against a union with S.D.B.H.K. Lenin referred to the group as a 'bundist creature'. Following the defeat of the Russian Revolution of 1905, S.D.B.H.K. had local units in Baku, Tiflis, Batumi and Shusha. During 1906-1907 the S.D.B.H.K. published Kiank ('Life') and, later, Tsayn ('Voice') as its Tiflis organs. Later Specifist organs included Banvor ('Worker') published in Baku in 1907 (revived in 1917), Kortz ('Work') in Tiflis in 1908; Nor kiank ('New Life') in Baku 1911-1912, Karun ('Spring') in Moscow irregularly 1910-1912 and Mer ughin ('Our Way') published in Baku in 1912. By 1910-1911 the organization had been largely suppressed by the Russian government. Following the 1917 February Revolution, the supported the Provisional Government of Russia. It opposed any reduction of the war effort. In the summer of 1917 the S.D.B.H.K. merged with the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Mensheviks) and the General Jewish Labour Bund to create a united Social Democratic organization in Baku. Whilst the Specifists never gained a broad mass following, the Specifist tendency continued to be active in the Communist Party of Armenia well into the Soviet period.

The Vita Sanctae Consortiae tells us that their religious conversion involved intense isolation. In the 420s monks from L√©rins visited Paulinus and told him how Eucherius, Galla and their sons were living an ascetic and secluded life in the monastery there. Both sons were later sent to visit Paulinus of Nola. The family practised \\"unwealth\\" - where life was restricted to the minimum in order to support prayer and devotion. After the death of Galla, Eucherius retired to Lerins. Since Epistola 51 was written in either 421 to 426, we can assume Galla died some time after then in the 420s.

Daniel Hymus (1835-1920) and his wife Fanny (nee Bell) (1848-1913) were involved in the establishment and running of the Rockingham Hotel, then named the Port Hotel.

The current house was built in 1895 by their son Daniel (1876-1932) and the property stayed in the family until 1935, when it was sold to farmer Joseph Stokes, who converted it to a dairy. The farmland around Hymus House was subdivided in 2007, under the condition that the building was to be restored. The house now functions as the landowning company‚Äôs administrative office.

Career He was the son of a Pomeranian nobleman Gert Ramel and Margrethe Massow. After study in Padua in 1568, and travel in Europe and Asia, he entered the service of the Polish King Stephen B√°thory and then of Duke Johan Frederik of Pomerania. But he, like the noble Mecklenburg Belou family, joined the service of Denmark in 1581, where a Mecklenburg princess, Sophie of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow was Frederick II's queen. Ramel was secretary of the German Chancery, and attended ambassadors to Denmark. The English diplomat Daniel Rogers described him as the young king's overseer and steward, and a chief counsellor to Sophie, and the mouthpiece of the four governors.David Scott Gehring, Diplomatic Intelligence on the Holy Roman Empire and Denmark during the Reigns of Elizabeth I and James VI, Camden Fifth Series, 49 (2016), pp. 146-7: Henry Ellis, Original Letters Illustrative of British History, 2nd Series, vol. 3 (London, 1827), pp. 149-50. =Embassy to Scotland= Henrik Ramel, Manderup Parsberg, Henrik Belou and Nicolaus Theophilus were ambassadors to Scotland in 1586. James VI appointed Sir James Melville of Halhill, William Schaw, and the Laird of Segie to be their companions. Melville described the events of the embassy. At Dunfermline Palace they discussed the disputed ownership of the Orkney Islands. It was also rumoured they discussed the king's marriage. They were not treated in the usual manner but had to pay their own expenses, and when they were to travel to St Andrews the promised horses were late. At St Andrews they suffered some abuse organised by supporters of the pro-French faction. A leading courtier, James Stewart, Earl of Arran, who had served in Sweden was a ringleader. The English ambassador Edward Wotton helped them because England and Denmark were allies, and told them privately that James VI had criticised Danish customs and their king Frederick II. According to Melville, the Danish envoys considered leaving Scotland, but he persuaded them to continue and spoke to James VI in their favour. When the mission was concluded, the ambassadors were supposed to receive gifts of gold chains but these were not ready.Thomas Thomson, Memoirs of his own life by Sir James Melville of Halhill (Edinburgh, 1827), pp. 346 In July 1590 he met the Scottish ambassador John Skene at Hamburg, and on 24 July Skene and his company dined with Ramel and his wife Abel Rantzau at Haderslev.David Scott Gehring, Diplomatic Intelligence on the Holy Roman Empire and Denmark during the Reigns of Elizabeth I and James VI, Camden Fifth Series, 49 (2016), pp. 155, 164. In 1597, he was sent to Joachim Frederick, Elector of Brandenburg to arrange the marriage of Christian IV to Anna Cathrine and signed the marriage contract. In August 1598 he wrote a letter of courtesy to James VI in response to a Scottish embassy which had requested a promise of military support to James in the event of the death of Elizabeth I of England.Annie I. Cameron, Warrender Papers, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1932), p. 365. Ramel came to London in January 1605 and during the visit of Anna of Denmark's brother, the Duke of Holstein, he was lodged at Denmark House on the Strand.Jemma Field, Anna of Denmark: The Material and Visual Culture of the Stuart Courts (Manchester, 2020), pp. 190, 212 fn. 63.

According to myth of their caste, they belong to the progeny of Hindu god, Shiva and have been Shaivites since ancient times. Chambhars are also Lingayat, since after reform movements of Basava. Chambhars have many contributions in religious and reform movements, e.g - Haralayya (Karnataka region), Santbai, Dapa Muchi founder of Darpanarayani sect, etc. Even prior to Bhakti movement Chambhars had consciousness of social upliftment and fought many times against oppression. Chambhars were also part of Bara Balutedar system of Maharashtra and also worked as hereditary servicing castes of villages. Historically, Chambhars are related to leather work but gradually they also moved towards midwifery, peasantry, poultry and industrial labour. Chambhars gave service to the rulers of their region by making leather products used in cavalry and later also worked as soldiers and guards for them. They played an important role in the armies of Maratha Empire and British Indian Army. A lot of Chambhars also served in Mahar Regiment but their recruitment got halted after the introduction of martial race theory. In 1943, The Chamar Regiment was formed where a small no. of Marathi Chambhars also incorporated but still it was dominated by Chamars of North Indian.

The club's name comes from its home ground, which is located on the former land of Lysengg√•rd, a farm in H√∏jbjerg. The football department is the most notable one of Idr√¶tsforeningen Lyseng, a major multi-sport club who compete in football, handball, volleyball, swimming and beach volleyball, among others. Founded in 1970 as a merger of Sk√•de Boldklub and Kragelund Idr√¶tsforening, the club is known for their iconic orange team colour, which was initially chosen as a compromise, as its parents clubs wore red and green, respectively. IF Lyseng is affiliated to DBU Jutland, the regional football association. The team plays its home matches at Lyseng Idr√¶tscenter, where it has been based since 1975. The club spent most of its history in the lower regional tiers of Danish football, but reached promotion to the Danish 2nd Division, the third tier, for the first time in its history ahead of the 2017‚Äì18 season. IF Lyseng has 1,200 paying members, making it the one of the largest sports clubs in Jutland and Denmark as a whole.  History  Beginnings and merger = The roots of IF Lyseng go back to 1922. In Sk√•de, on the lands of estate owner Valdemar Rasmussen, a group of pupils attending Sk√•de Skole began playing association football after school. At first, this was mostly random kicking to a leather laced ball but soon an organised club was established, \\"Sk√•de Boldklub\\", and a board was elected. Later, the team was allowed to use the pitch at Sk√•de Skole, popularly called the \\"hen house\\" (or \\"H√∏nsehuset\\" in Danish). Football quickly grew in popularity, and youths formerly of the athletics department began playing football instead. In 1936, an association football pitch with a clubhouse (today the Marselisborg Hockey Club) was constructed next to Hotel Kragelund. The board of Sk√•de Boldklub immediately applied for a relocation to this ground, which was accepted under the conditions that a name change occurred, and Sk√•de Boldklub therefore changed its name to Kragelund Idr√¶tsforening (Kragelund IF). For two decades, the small Kragelund Stadium, surrounded by tall trees, was the setting the activities of Kragelund IF, until the parish of Holme-Tranbjerg bought six acres of land from Lysengg√•rd Farm in 1955, on which two association football pitches and two handball courts were constructed on the exact area where Lyseng Idr√¶tscenter is located today. At the same time, a new clubhouse was erected in the area; a wooden house which had previously functioned as a restaurant during the summers at Moesg√•rd Beach. In Holme, however, a club had also formed. At \\"the meadow\\" (or \\"Engen\\" in Danish), by Holme Skole, students had been playing football for decades, and a sports club was finally founded on 1 April 1953 named Holme Idr√¶tsforening (Holme IF). Holme IF and Kragelund IF quickly became local rivals. Following the Municipal Reform of 1970, many changes were implemented for sports in the area. At the executive level, the two clubs held multiple meetings on the subject of merging. These discussions resulted in a decision to merge, which was decided at a general executive meeting on 18 June 1970. Thus, Holme's red uniforms and Kragelund's green uniforms were, after having reached a compromise, replaced with an iconic orange colour. Then, the old \\"dance restaurant\\" at Moesg√•rd Beach was transformed into Lyseng Idr√¶tspark, where the club had its first home ground. In the mid-1970s, there were talks about the clubhouse not being to date, and negotiations were initiated with the municipality on the construction of a new clubhouse. However, a fire in 1978 caused the clubhouse to burn down. Therefore, negotiations on building a new clubhouse were moved forward, and in the intervening period, outdoor locker room facilities at Lyseng Swimming Pool were used as an emergency solution. In 1980, IF Lyseng initiated its new clubhouse, one of the most modern in Aarhus at the time. = Recent years = IF Lyseng spent most of its history in the lower regional tiers of Danish football, but surprisingly reached promotion to the Danish 2nd Division, the third tier, for the first time in its history ahead of the 2017‚Äì18 season. This feat was achieved under head coach Mick Andresen, who had coached the first team since 2011, where Lyseng was placed in the bottom of the Jutland Series, the fifth tier of Danish football. Before his tenure as a manager, he had a short career as a footballer for AGF, the major club in the city. The club made its first appearance in the third tier on 6 August 2017 in the home opener against Jammerbugt FC, which ended in a 1-2 loss. Issa Kharoub scored Lyseng's first goal ever in the division, a penalty kick in the 61st minute. The following week, however, the club achieved its first victory with a win in the local matchup against VSK Aarhus, bringing three points home to H√∏jbjerg after a 1-2 win at Vejlby Stadion. In the autumn, Lyseng finished 7th out of 8 in Group 3, with only Odder IGF having a worse record - partly due to Odder being deducted six points for paying salaries to amateur players. Therefore, the club competed in the relegation group during the spring of 2018, where they did not win a single game and thus suffered relegation to the Denmark Series after only one season at the third level. Before relegation became a fact, head coach Andresen had agreed to step down from the position. John Andersen was appointed as his replacement on 21 May 2018, with Johnny Jungquist becoming his assistant.

History and establishment  On May 28, 1918, in the Transcaucasian Seym, the Muslim faction declared itself as the National Council of Azerbaijan. Thus, in fact, the first Parliament of Azerbaijan was established, and the foundation of the first parliamentary republic was laid. As stated in the Declaration of Independence, \\"Until the convening of the Constituent Assembly, Azerbaijan is headed by the National Council elected by the people and the Provisional Government, which is responsible to the National Council.\\" On September 17, 1918, three months after the formation of Fatali khan Khoyski's cabinet, the government of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic moved to Baku. Baku was declared the capital. On November 9, the state flag of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was replaced by a tricolour flag with the image of a crescent and an octagonal star. Socio-political, economic and cultural life in the various sectors of the construction work expanded. Adhering to the legal norms and rules of the parliamentary republic, the government of Fatali khan Khoyski also began preparations for the convening of the Constituent Assembly. To this end, a special commission was created. National Council in 1918, June 17 since the decree of 6 months thereafter, or rather, the government's sole authority to maintain authority in the case, Fatali Khan Khoyski initiative and at the request, 1918, November 16, the National Council of the operational again started. At the suggestion of the Chairman of the Government Fatali khan Khoyski, the National Council of Azerbaijan undertook to convene the Constituent Assembly. The first session of the Parliament of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic At the meeting of the National Council of Azerbaijan chaired by Mammad Amin Rasulzade on November 19, 1918, critical decisions in the history of the Azerbaijani Parliament were made. At that time, the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, despite operating in challenging and complicated conditions, took the path of extremely democratic development. At that meeting on 19 November, it was stated that all nationalities living within the state should be represented in parliament. According to the Caucasus calendar, these areas have a population of 2,750,000. Of these, 1,900,000 were Muslims, 500,000 were Armenians, and 230,000 were Russians. Muslims - 80, Armenians - 21, Russians - 10 representatives should be sent at the rate of one representative for every 24,000 people. It is decided to form the Azerbaijani Parliament consisting of 120 members. According to the law, out of 21 Armenian representatives to be elected to the Parliament, 8 were to be elected from Ganja, 8 from Shusha and 5 from Baku Armenian committees. 10 representatives of the Russian population in Baku were to be sent to the Russian National Council, -1 to the German National Organization, -1 to the Jewish National Council, 1 to the Georgian Committee and -1 to the Polish Committee. In addition, the law provided for the sending of 3 representatives to the Parliament of the Republic of Azerbaijan by the Baku Trade Union Council and 2 representatives by the Baku Industry and Trade. Members of parliament had parliamentary immunity. According to the decision of the meeting of the National Council of Azerbaijan dated November 19, 1918, 44 Turkish-Muslim representatives elected to the All-Russian Constituent Assembly in late 1917 were directly included in the new parliament. The remaining 36 Muslim deputies and representatives of other nationalities had to be re- elected. The formation of the new Parliament was to be completed on December 3, 1918. Parliament in 1918 Apparently, despite the fact that half a year has passed since the March 1918 genocide, 21 Armenian representatives were allowed to participate in the Azerbaijani parliament. This step taken in the historical conditions of that time is a bright proof of the deep respect of the Azerbaijani people for the democratic nature and human rights. On behalf of the National Council of Azerbaijan in connection with the convening of the Parliament of the Republic of Azerbaijan, its chairman, M.A. On November 29, 1918, signed by Rasulzade \\"To the whole population of Azerbaijan\\" In Azerbaijani and Russian languages. The application is published. The appeal stated: {{Quote‚ÄúCitizens! War and revolution during the emergency condition, considering the strike, which has the Suraiya-team iqtizai time to reconnect with Baku, Azerbaijan collected. Suraiya-team first adopted the law only the Muslims belonging to Suraiya-Milli national picture from the state was to take a picture. According to the law adopted on the 19th of this month, the National Council will become a 120-member Majlis-Mabusan (Parliament) by December 3. Lawyers from the country's provinces were invited to the meeting, as well as representatives from minority nations. The prisoner who will be gathered in this way will be the owner of our country, will decide its destiny, organize its government and defend its interests until the Assembly of the Azerbaijani Parliament convenes in the future by a general election method... let us put aside enmity and discord that give us nothing but disaster and misery. History has forced us all to live together. Let's build our lives on a rational and humane basis, love and respect each other, so that we can easily bear the natural hardships of a new life. Despite national and religious differences, all Azerbaijani citizens are children of the same country. They must reach out and help each other to build a common life in a common homeland and achieve their happiness together.‚Äù On December 7, 1918, at one o'clock in the afternoon, the grand opening of the Azerbaijani Parliament took place in the building of Haji Zeynalabdin Tagiyev's former girls'; school on Nikolayev Street (now the building of the Institute of Manuscripts named after Fuzuli). It was the first parliament in the entire Muslim East to be formed on the basis of the most democratic principles of the time. Chairman of the National Council of Azerbaijan Mohammad Amin Rasulzadeh delivered a congratulatory speech at the opening of the parliament. At the suggestion of the Musavat faction, Alimardan bey Topchubashov was elected chairman of the parliament, and Dr. Hasan bey Agayev was elected his first deputy. As A. Topchubashov, who left for the Paris Peace Conference, was on a visit, H. Agayev headed the activities of the parliament. At the first session of the parliament, the resignation of the government of Fatali khan Khoyski was accepted and it was decided to form a new government. The formation of the new government was again entrusted to F. Khoisky. On December 26, 1918, F. Khoisky addressed the parliament with his program and submitted the composition of the new government for approval. The parliament adopted the government's program and expressed confidence in the government formed by F. Khoyski. One of the most important lessons of history at the time of the establishment of the Azerbaijani Parliament is that despite the fact that Republican figures and all our people allocated 21 seats to Armenians and 10 to Russians in the first Azerbaijani Parliament, they did not attend the opening. The Baku Russian National Council decides not to participate in the Parliament if it has no moral right to speak on behalf of the Russian population in Azerbaijan. They tried to prove that Azerbaijan had violated the idea of a \\"united and indivisible Russia\\" in declaring its independence. Allegedly, the participation of the Russian National Council in the Parliament and the Government would mean \\"recognition of the fact of separation of Azerbaijan from Russia\\", which facilitated the recognition of Azerbaijan in the international arena. The decision of the Russian National Council did not reflect the views of the Russian population, which supported the convening of the Azerbaijani parliament and the participation of its representatives there. Thus, the \\"Russian-Slavic Society\\" operating in Baku appealed to the chairman of the National Council of Azerbaijan MA Rasulzade to allow the representatives of this society to \\"enter the Parliament\\" in order to participate in \\"general state-building\\" in Azerbaijan. At that time, Armenians, unable to reconcile with the independence of Azerbaijan, also defended the Russian National Council and did not participate in parliamentary sessions for some time. The tactic of Armenians not to participate in the Azerbaijani Parliament has been going on for more than two months. Finally, they also decide to participate in Parliament. They create two factions in the Azerbaijani Parliament - the Armenian and the Dashnaktsutyun. Their subsequent activities in the parliament showed that the main reason for the participation of Armenians in the Azerbaijani Parliament was not to serve the establishment of Azerbaijani statehood, development of the Azerbaijani economy and culture, but to gain a new platform to promote their chauvinist separatist ideas of \\"Greater Armenia\\". In addition, the existence of 11 factions and groups in the Parliament, which concentrated the supreme power in the hands of the country and numbered less than 100 people, seriously hampered the building of an independent state in a very complex domestic and international environment. Individual factions and groups in many cases preferred the interests of their limited factions and groups to the national interest. For example, the Socialist Bloc of Parliament, under the guise of \\"protecting the interests of the poor\\", regularly promoted the annexation of Azerbaijan to Soviet Russia, succeeded in deciding to open a diplomatic mission in Soviet Russia, and finally advocated the intervention of the Red Army. It was nothing but a violation of the People's Republic. From the first days of its establishment, the Azerbaijani Parliament has been building its work on the basis of organizational principles inherent in democratic republics. The law on the organization of the Parliament provides for 120 members of the Parliament, but for various reasons, the Parliament has never had this number of deputies. However, the Parliament of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic has left a deep and rich mark on the history of Azerbaijani statehood, especially in the history of parliamentary culture, with its experience of building an independent state, high-level legislative acts and decisions adopted during its 17-month activity. The first meeting of the Azerbaijani Parliament, the party factions and groups in its work teams are making statements about the programs. These statements drew attention to a common goal - to preserve the independence and territorial integrity, national and political rights of the young Republic of Azerbaijan, to establish and strengthen friendly relations of the Azerbaijani people and government with other nations and governments, especially neighbouring governments, to establish a democratic state, to carry out a wide range of social reforms, create a powerful army that can defend the country.  Adoption of laws  More than 270 bills were submitted to the parliament, about 230 of which were adopted. The laws were discussed in a lively and businesslike exchange of views and were adopted only after the third reading. Members of parliament from 11 factions and groups participated in the preparation, discussion and approval of parliamentary laws. There were 11 commissions in the parliament: Finance and Budget, Legislative Proposals, Central Commission for Elections to the Constituent Assembly, Mandate, Military, Agrarian Issues: Commissions on Inquiries, Command and Control on the Use of the Country's Productive Forces, Editorial and Labor Commissions. The activities of the Parliament were governed by a charter specially prepared for this purpose - the \\"Instruction (instruction) of the Parliament of Azerbaijan.\\" Mammad Amin Rasulzade assessed the activity of the Parliament of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic as follows:  The end of the Parliament  On the night of April 26-27, 1920, the occupying 11th Red Army units crossed the borders of the independent Azerbaijani state without declaring war and attacked Baku. Baku was also besieged from the sea. Early in the morning of April 27, armed groups of communists seized important facilities both inside and outside the city. In fact, in the conditions of the overthrow of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, a delegation of communists acting on the dictates of the occupiers issued an ultimatum to hand over power to the Azerbaijani Parliament on behalf of the Central Committee of the Azerbaijani Communist (Bolshevik) Party, the Baku bureau of the Caucasus Committee of the Russian Communist (Bolsheviks). In this connection, after the resignation of Nasib bey Yusifbeyli on March 30, a special commission headed by Mammad Hasan Hajinski (MA Rasulzade, G. Garabeyov, A. Safikurdski, A. Gardashov, S.Aƒüamalƒ±oglu) was created. Mammad Hasan Hajinski, who had close ties with the Azerbaijani Bolsheviks, held talks with the Communists. The ultimatum and the results of the commission's negotiations were discussed at the last (145th) session of the parliament chaired by Mammad Yusif Jafarov. The meeting started at 20.45 on April 27 and lasted until 23.25. During the discussions at the suggestion of MA Rasulzade, the doors of the Parliament were opened to the people. In his speech, M.A. Rasulzadeh said: Informing about the ultimatum, M.H. Hajinski said that the power should be handed over to the communists tonight; The Central Committee of the AK (b) P states that otherwise, it will do its best to hand over power to the Red Army. The Communists also warn that if we do not hand over power to them tonight, the political parties represented in Parliament, including the Musavat party, will be banned; M.H.Hajinski also said that the Communists refused to consider our proposals and warned that if the government is not handed over voluntarily, all responsibility for the consequences lies with the members of Parliament. At the end of his speech, M.Hajinski called on the members of Parliament to make the only right decision in the current situation \\"for the salvation of the nation.\\" However, Samad agha Agamalioglu, Gara bey Garabeyov, Aslan bey Safikurdski, Mohammad Amin Rasulzade and Sultanmajid Ganizade opposed the proposal of MH Hajinski to unconditionally hand over power to the communists. However, in order to prevent bloodshed, they expressed their support for the transfer of power to the Communists only under certain conditions, first of all, on the condition of maintaining the independence of the Motherland. As a result, the Parliament decided by a majority vote to hand over power to the Communists on the following terms: # The full independence of Azerbaijan, ruled by the Soviet government, is preserved; # The government formed by the Communist Party of Azerbaijan will be a temporary body; # The final form of government of Azerbaijan shall be determined by the supreme legislative body of Azerbaijan in the person of the Soviets of Workers', Peasants' and Soldiers' Deputies, independent of any external pressure; # All government employees remain in office, but those in positions of responsibility are replaced; # The newly formed Provisional Communist Government guarantees the inviolability of the life and property of members of Parliament and Government; # Measures will be taken to prevent the Red Army from entering Baku by battle; # The new government will take decisive measures at its disposal against all foreign forces seeking to undermine Azerbaijan's independence, no matter where it takes place. The Parliament of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic remained faithful to its democratic traditions and ideas of independence at the same meeting held under siege. However, the occupiers ignored the decision of the Parliament of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic to hand over power to the communists peacefully, without bloodshed. Although Northern Azerbaijan was re-occupied by Russia as a result of the military intervention of Soviet Russia in violation of international law and the bloody military operations of the XI Red Army units, the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic has left a deep mark on the history of our people's liberation movement. Despite living only 23 months, the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic has proved that even the most brutal colonial and repressive regimes are not able to destroy the ideals of freedom and the traditions of independent statehood of the Azerbaijani people. The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, the first parliamentary republic in the history of the Azerbaijani people, was also the first example of a democratic, legal and secular state in the whole East, including the Turkic-Islamic world. The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic did not lag behind the traditional democratic republics of Europe in terms of its political structure, the measures are taken to build a democratic state, as well as the goals and objectives set for it.  Elections  Is the stenographic record of the Parliament of the Republic of Azerbaijan reports that the elections will be hidden and Muslim Majlis-M…ôbusana the parliament members, in addition to the 44 people who are part of the National Council elected 36 new members. The proportion of members to be involved was as follows: From the Armenian minority population - 21 members: 8 from Ganja Armenian Population Committee, 8 from Shusha Armenian Population Committee, 5 from Baku Armenian Population Committee; \\\\- from the Russian population from the Russian National Council in Baku - 10; \\\\- Organizational-nationality of the German population - 1; \\\\- Jewish National Council - 1; \\\\- from the Georgian committee - 1; \\\\- from the Polish Committee - 1; \\\\- Baku Trade Union Council - 3; \\\\- Jointly with Baku Soviet Congress and Trade and Industrial Societies - 2.

Written by both of the performers in Barcelona, Spain, the track was released on June 22, 2020 through XL Recordings and Columbia Records as the fourth single of Arca's fourth studio album Kick I.  Background  Arca and Rosal√≠a have hung out multiple times. Their friendship started in 2018 when Arca discovered the Spanish singer through her hit single \\"Malamente\\" and saw her set at the S√≥nar music festival. In April 2019, during an Instagram livestream, Arca teased a song called \\"KLK\\" and stated \\"I can't wait to put this record out, oh my god\\". The couple of friends were seen in public again at Frank Ocean's PrEP+ Party in New York City, where the Venezuelan played a special DJ set. In November 2019, Rosal√≠a sampled Arca's voice as an interlude to transition from \\"A Pal√©\\" to \\"Con Altura\\" during her performance at the 2019 Latin Grammy Awards. On March 8, 2020, Arca revealed to Garage Magazine that her new album would be released in 2020 and that would feature collaborations with Bj√∂rk and Rosal√≠a among others, confirming the participation of the Spanish new flamenco artist in her fourth studio album. On June 21, Arca and Rosal√≠a had an Instagram live conversation in where they discussed the track and previewed it. Without any anticipation, \\"KLK\\" was released on digital download and different streaming platforms the day after along with its instrumental version.  Composition  The track was first recorded in Barcelona on September 17, 2018 and was lyric empty. To fill the song with lyrics but, since the Spanish singer was promoting her second studio album in Madrid and Miami, her vocals were sent to the Venezuelan musician through a WhatsApp voicenote. Thus, the song has partly been recorded on iPhone. \\"KLK\\" was also produced by Venezuelan musician Luis Garban, who goes under the stage name Cardopusher. Garban and Arca became close in high school back in the day. About \\"KLK\\", Arca explains that it is inspired by traditional Venezuelan music, specifically on an instrument called furruco: ‚ÄúVenezuelan music has always been with me, and I am grateful that I have studied some of the typical styles of Venezuelan music. I always think of the furruco when I program a subbass. It is an indigenous instrument of Venezuela that is played with friction, you rub a stick hooked from the leather of a large drum and it has a super infra sub bass, it marks the pulse of the gaita, a style of music typical of Venezuela\\".

The expeditions were inspired by previous trans-oceanic expeditions by the Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl. Main aim of the Abora expeditions was to prove that a keel-less reed boat could be steered crosswise and against prevailing winds, using sideboards (leeboards) in lieu of a fixed keel. The name of the vessels was derived from the Canarian deity Abora. The Abora I originated as a school project in Germany using locally grown Giant (Miscanthus). All subsequent vessels were commissioned to boat builders from the Aymara nation living at Lake Titicaca in Bolivia; the same boat builders worked already for Thor Heyerdahl. As building material they used the very sturdy and durable Totora reed which is far better suited for this purpose. Vessels Abora I = ABORA I (1999) The Abora (or Abora I, in retrospective) was designed, built and used between 1996 and 1999. It sailed from Alghero (Sardinia, Italy) to Piombino (Tuscany, Italy). =Abora II= The Abora II sailed in 2002 across the Mediterranean: from Alexandria (Egypt) to Beirut (Lebanon), Cyprus and back to Alexandria. It thus became the first modern-time reed boat which managed to complete an extended round trip and then to return to the port of departure. The departure at Alexandria coincided with the inauguration of the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, the new Alexandrian library; the Abora crew brought some gifts (books) from Thor Heyerdahl's Kon Tiki Museum in Oslo, Norway in honor of the inauguration. Thor Heyerdahl had also personally supported the preparation of the Abora I and II expeditions; by coincidence the launch of the Abora II took place on 18 April 2002, which turned out to be the day when Thor Heyerdahl died. =Abora III= ABORA III (2007), New York With Abora III, Dominique G√∂rlitz attempted the first ever crossing of the Atlantic from West to East with a reed boat. G√∂rlitz considered it possible that such events actually took place in antiquity. As a motivation, he particularly quoted the finding of traces of cocaine and nicotine in Egyptian mummies, including chopped tobacco leaves and the remains of a Mexican tobacco beetle in the mummy of Ramses II (1298‚Äì1213 BC). Both the tobacco plant and the coca plant are only native to America (for more information on this topic see the Wikipedia article on claims of trans-oceanic travel originating from the New World). Compared to an East-West crossing, which Thor Heyerdahl successfully demonstrated in 1970 with the barely maneuverable reed boat Ra II, a west-east crossing of the Atlantic is much more difficult. This must be done further north along the Gulf Stream. However, the Guf Stream does not flow evenly, but forms huge eddies. Furthermore, the winds there blow inconsistently from all directions. This means that this crossing cannot take place as a practically pure drift, as in the case of the Ra II in the opposite direction, rather the reed boat must be able to cover longer distances by wind even under adverse conditions. The hull of the boat was again manufactured in Bolivia (in 2006). The boat was finalized one year later in New York. The Abora III expedition started in New York on July 11, 2007. An initially supportive Azores high dissolved completely in early August, and the crew faced one storm after another. Two of these storm lows reached hurricane strengths with wind speeds of up to 51 knots. These bad weather fronts affected the Abora III, but did not yet lead to serious damage. However, three side swords broke during the first storm, but this happened close enough to the American mainland that replacement swords could be delivered and replaced. In mid-August, after 500 km of a total of around 6000 km, a calm delayed the trip. A three-day hurricane then damaged the rear of the Abora III on August 27, 2007 in such a way that it had to be separated from the hull. during the subsequent 4 days, the crew reinstalled the intact rudder and moved the mast further towards the bow. The modified Abora III could temporarily set full sail and even sail up to 90¬∞ to the wind. On September 4, the next storm with wind force 10 severely affected both the Abora III and an escort vessel approaching from the Azores. Therefore, the crew abandoned the experiment on September 5, 2007, about 900 kilometres from the Azores, the 11-member crew and switched to the escort vessel. The reed boat was left to the sea after cutting the strings that held the hull together. A message in a bottle thrown into the water before the boat was evacuated was found in the Bahamas in October 2010. This illustrates that a West-East crossing of the Atlantic requires an intact sailing ability of the boat (in contrast to the opposite direction: Thor Heyerdahl's Ra II was also badly damaged in 1970, but was still able to drift to America with the help of the Canary Current). =Abora IV= Abora IV at Santorin Caldera The aim of the Abora IV expedition was to retrace possible trade contacts between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. Herodotus mentioned in his Histories trading contacts between the Egyptians and the Caucasus on the eastern Black Sea coast; according to him, especially metals were imported into Egypt via this route. According to the expedition leader Dominique G√∂rlitz's assumption, tin and amber were also exported from Central Europe to Egypt via the Balkans and finally the Black Sea to the Mediterranean. Varna in Bulgaria was chosen as the starting point of the expedition both because of the place's historic significance (Varna Necropolis) and for practical reasons; the expedition received strong support from the Varna Archaeological Museum. The final construction took place from May to August 2019 in Beloslav near Varna. Due to the late delivery of the prefabricated reed bundles from Bolivia and due to extremely bad weather conditions in Bulgaria, the launch of the Abora was greatly delayed and the start of the expedition could only take place on August 16. The Abora IV sailed through the Black Sea to Istanbul in Turkey, then through the Bosporus (on tow, for safety reasons), through the Marmara Sea and into the Dardanelles (again on tow) to √áanakkale (a modern harbor near antic Troy), then onward into the Aegean Sea. Here, the first station was the Greek island of Limnos, where the vessel managed to enter and to leave the prehistoric port of Poliochni without being supported by a tug boat. From there, it sailed on to Santorin, hereby managing to pass several straits between several Greek islands. During the expedition, Dominique G√∂rlitz received the offer from the Turkish Ministry of Culture in Ankara to exhibit the reed boat in the Patara Archeology Park (near Antalya) as a permanent exhibit. Thereupon it was decided to sail from Santorin straight to Ka≈ü (a modern harbour near Patara) at the Lycian coast. Here, the Abora IV arrived on 19 September; the entire distance from Varna to Ka≈ü was covered in 34 days. As planned, the vessel is now on permanent display on the Agora of the ancient city of Patara. Scientific assessment Like most experimental- archaeological projects, also the ABORA projects could only examine the technical feasibility of a proposed method. Whether these methods were indeed exploited in the past, can only be clarified by archaeological finds. The Abora expeditions specifically acclaimed to have reproduced an ancient navigation technology based on the use of leeboards. The expedition organizers consider their approach being corroborated by: *ancient petroglyphes of vessels that show explicit details which can be interpreted as leeboards. *ancient depictions of reed rafts in general: Even if no details of the steering technology are shown, the depictions prove as such that reed rafts were in widespread use, and this again suggests that those vessels were also navigable, able to conduct e.g. round trips, or harbour approaches. Larger reed rafts are too heavy to be moved by oars and thus depended on their sailing capabilities. The expedition leader Dominique G√∂rlitz presented various examples of such depictions (with and without leeboards) in his books and on the official project website. Ethnological evidence for the use of large navigable rafts exists only from South America, where such rafts were in use also after the Spanish conquest. These rafts used so-called centerboards or guaras; they could be navigated even without a rudder. Also Thor Heyerdahl conducted already some experiments using those guaras. Therefore, Heyerdahl followed the ABORA expeditions with great interest until his death in 2002. Positive appraisals of the ABORA projects came also from various other scientists, for instance Havva Iskan (Akdeniz University, Turkey, lead archaeologist at Patara, where the ABORA IV is now on permanent display). In 2007, during the ABORA III expedition, a critical article appeared in the German popular-scientific journal Spektrum der Wissenschaft. It quotes a German Egyptologist who doubts G√∂rlitz' interpretation of details of boat depictions as leeboards, as well as his assumptions with regard to the age of those depictions, but does not offer an alternative explanation. Specifically with regard to the Abora III expedition (attempt of a West-East Atlantic crossing), doubts are also expressed about alleged evidences for tobacco or cocaine use in ancient Egypt.

Geography The Fradinhos are located off the coast of Terceira, approximately off of Porto Judeu and from Angra do Hero√≠smo. The four exposed rock formations are the basaltic tops of a submarine volcanic cone, heavily eroded by the sea and frequently immersed completely by waves during inclement weather. As such, the rocks only reach between above sea level. However, the Fradinhos are part of larger rock formations which slope up to sea level rather steeply from the surrounding ocean floor. The underwater environment in the area is characterized by lava flows with various caverns, slopes, and fractures‚Äîall eroded by the sea over time‚Äîwhich is typical in the volcanically-formed Azores. =Biome= The zone around Fradinhos is biodiverse, with more than 100 identified species. Its waters are home to Azores chromis (Chromis limbata), barred hogfish, black corals, groupers, Mediterranean parrotfish (Sparisoma cretense), red scorpionfish (Scorpaena scrofa), oysters, slipper lobsters (family Scyllaridae), and European spider crab (Maja squinado). The area also supports pelagic fish such as barracuda, bluefish, longfin yellowtail, and Chilean devil ray. Though the exposed surfaces of the Fradinhos are not vegetated by terrestrial plants, the underwater surfaces are home to various algae including the red alga Asparagopsis armata. The Fradinhos offer excellent visibility for scuba diving. However, due to their location in open ocean relatively far off the coast, strong currents, and caverns up to deep, only experienced divers should attempt a visit. By boat it takes approximately 20 minutes to reach Fradinhos from Angra do Hero√≠smo, or 35 minutes from Praia da Vit√≥ria.

Few members of this gens are mentioned by ancient historians, but others are known from inscriptions. Origin The nomen Suedius belongs to a class of gentilicia formed using the suffix ' or ', originally based on names ending in ', but later applied to other names without regard to morphology.Chase, pp. 121, 122. Most of the Suedii known from epigraphy came from Umbria or Picenum, indicating that they were likely of Umbrian or Picentine origin, although the surname Sabinus and its diminutive, Sabellus, borne by two of this gens, suggests that at least some of the family claimed Sabine descent.Chase, pp. 113, 114. Praenomina The only praenomina attested among the Suedii are Lucius, Titus, and Quintus, all of which were among the most common names throughout Roman history. Members * Suedia, buried at Aquae Sirenses in Mauretania Caesariensis, aged eighty-five.. * Lucius Suedius Bassus, one of the municipal duumvirs at Lucus Feroniae in Etruria in the first half of the second century.

Suedius was more concerned with his popularity than with the discipline of the soldiers under his command, who despoiled the villages of Alpes Maritimae. He seems to have survived Otho, and was restored to favour under Vespasian, serving as a judex in Pompeii.

Early life and high school career Queen began playing basketball at the age of four at a hoop in his garage. He played shortstop and pitcher on the baseball field growing up, which he said was his best sport. Queen played football for the FAB Phenoms Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) program. He played basketball for North County High School in his hometown of Glen Burnie, Maryland. He began playing for the varsity team as a sophomore for the final playoff game of the season. Queen moved to a high school in Florida for his junior season but was not allowed to play basketball because he had transferred too late. Queen returned to North County as a senior and played nine games. He had no college basketball offers by the end of his high school career. College career Queen originally planned to attend Prince George's Community College due to a mutual relationship between the school's basketball coach and his AAU coach, but he redshirted his first season because of paperwork issues. He began playing college basketball at College of Marin in Marin County, California. While attending the school, Queen lived in crowded conditions at a retirement home before he and his roommates were kicked out. For one week, he lived with three teammates in a car in East Oakland, before moving into the home of his teammate's relative. Queen scored a freshman season-high 29 points, to go with 11 rebounds and eight steals, in a December 10, 2016 win over Feather River College. In 14 games with Marin, he averaged a team-high 21.3 points, 7.9 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game.

Besides his judicial career, from 1905 Morwitz was a friend of the poet Stefan George and member of his circle, publishing poetry in George's journal, the Bl√§tter f√ºr die Kunst. Following George's death in 1933 and his own subsequent emigration to the United States, he played an important role in promoting George's work in the Anglosphere through translations of his poems.

He won the folk competition of the Vi√±a del Mar International Song Festival in 1964 with the tune \\"Qu√© bonita va\\", performed by Los Huasos Quincheros. Biography Flores del Campo was born in the rural locality of Antonio Varas, in the outskirts of Santiago. He began his musical apprenticeship in 1923, when he began to study singing with Claudio Massuetto. In 1929 he obtained a scholarship from the Municipality of Vi√±a del Mar to study in the United States, where he lived for eight years. There, he began a film career, acting in a minor role in the film El d√≠a que me quieras, alongside Carlos Gardel. At the same time, he performed in various hotels and nightclubs in New York and Los Angeles. With these experiences he returned to Chile in 1939, starring in one of the first national film productions, Romance de medio centenario (Chile Films), and later artistic director of the Municipal Casino of Vi√±a del Mar. A sore throat prevented him from keep singing, but this allowed him to focus on musical composition, in which he was prolific. Of the 150 registered works he penned, many of them have been successfully recorded by Chilean and foreign artists. One of his best-known works is the musicalization of the work La pergola de las flores by the Chilean author Isidora Aguirre, a musical comedy released in 1960, and set in Santiago in the late 1920s. Flores del Campo composed the music in function of the rhythms in vogue of those years, adding to it melodies from Chilean folk music. In this way, he incorporated rhythms such as charleston, waltz (\\"Yo vengo de San Rosendo\\" or \\"Campo lindo\\"), cuecas (\\"La revolta\\"), tango-habanera (\\"Je suis Pierre\\") and tonada (\\"Tonada de medianoche\\"). Death Flores del Campo died on December 11, 1993, in Santiago, of a heart attack. His health was already debilitated after having throat cancer diagnosed the year before.

St Jacques retired after 30 years of service in October 2016, while Stephane Dion was Minister of Foreign Affairs and just short of one year after the Trudeau government came to power. =Controversies=Drop the gloves with China on canola In March 2019, St Jacques suggested that in retaliation for China's suspension of canola imports from Canada that Canada could expel Chinese athletes who were training in Canada for the 2022 Beijing Winter Games and could bring Beijing before the UN Security Council where it could level accusations of bad faith. He also suggested bringing the Chinese to the WTO process. To PMO: call me St Jacques made the headlines in July 2019, when someone at the PMO convinced Paul Thoppil, ADM for Asia-Pacific at Global Affairs Canada, called him to ask for him not to comment on China in the media. St Jacques said the PMO should call him directly if it has a problem with what he is saying. It came to light that the PMO had employed similar tactics with another Ambassador, David Mulroney. Later on once the damage had been done, the Minister in charge of Global Affairs, Chrystia Freeland, called him privately to beg his forgiveness, and her colleagues quashed a motion for an investigation by a Parliamentary subcommittee into the affair. The two Ambassadors earned strong support in from Colin Robertson, a former colleague, when he said: Chinese supply-chain v Hong Kong refugees In early May 2020, St Jacques pointed out that it would be nice to shelter refugees from Hong Kong in light of the 2020 police crackdown on 2019 protestors for democracy: References Category:Living people Category:Ambassadors of Canada to China ","title":"Guy Saint-Jacques"},{"id":"64015968","text":"Aroostook Farm is an experimental farm near Presque Isle, Maine.

Following the foundation of the Women's Charitable Society in 1819, numerous charitable societies were founded all over Sweden. These were commonly referred to as fruntimmers-skyddsf√∂reningar (literary:'Women's protection societies') because they were founded and managed by (rich) women. They were founded with the equivalent women's charitable societies in Germany as role models, with the common thought to offer secular charity without using it to enforce religion upon the poor. These fruntimmers-skyddsf√∂reningar eventually existed in almost every city and town, and in 1858 the duchess of √ñsterg√∂tland founded her own local fruntimmers-skyddsf√∂rening for the area of Kungsholm in Stockholm. In 1866, the Kungsholm Protection Society united all the other local Protection Societies in Stockholm to one central organisation named the Stockholm Public Protection Society. The Society collaborated with the authorities and acted as a channel between the private charitable societies and the Communal Poor Help of the state which had been introduced in Sweden in the Poor Help Law of 1847. They provided temporary monetary assistance as well as acting as employment agencies and housing agencies. From 1867, they were given financial support from the city council. Their work was important as a complement to the social help provided by the state, because after the introduction of the Poor Help Law of 1871, the communal and state authorities could no longer give any assistance to any poor people except the physically or mentally challenged, the aged or children, so all the other in need of assistance were referred to private charities, notably the Stockholms Allm√§nna Skyddsf√∂rening or its equivalent local fruntimmers-skyddsf√∂rening, as most cities and towns had one.

The line operates every 20 minutes during the weekday peak hour and weekend late nights, 30 minutes all other times on weekdays, and 40-45 minutes on weekends. Y2 trips are roughly 55 minutes long, Y7 trips are roughly 62 minutes long, and Y8 trips are roughly 70 minutes long. This route provides service along Georgia Avenue in Maryland providing service to multiple communities. Background Route Y2 at Wheaton station Routes Y2, Y7, and Y8 operate along Georgia Avenue providing frequent service to multiple communities. Route Y2 operates daily as a direct service between Silver Spring station and MedStar Montgomery Medical Center, skipping both the ICC Park & Ride lot and the Leisure World clubhouse. Route Y7 operates on weekdays only via the Leisure World clubhouse but instead terminates at the ICC Park & Ride lot instead of MedStar Montgomery Medical Center. Route Y8 operates daily on the same Y2 routing but serves the Leisure World clubhouse. Routes Y7 and Y8 only operate between 6:00 AM and 8:00 PM when the Leisure World clubhouse is open while route Y2 rarely operates between those hours on weekdays (it runs all day on weekends). Routes Y2, Y7, and Y8 operate out of Montgomery division. It often uses articulated buses due to its high ridership volume. History The line originally operated under former streetcar lines prior to becoming buses in 1973. During Metro's inception, routes Y2 and Y4 operated between Silver Spring station and Kensington before being replaced by Ride On through the 1980s-1990s. Then route Y4 operated between Rockville and Glenmont station before being replaced by Ride On route 49 in 1998. Route Y1 operated between Montgomery Village and Potomac Park. Route Y3 originally operated between Leisure World and Southwest Mall, then became apart of the Homecrest- Wheaton Line. Both the Y1 and Y3 were later discontinued around the 1990s and replaced by Ride On routes. The original Georgia Avenue‚ÄìMaryland Line operated as routes Y5, Y6, Y7, Y8, and Y9. At one point during its inception, route Y5 would operate between Leisure World to Federal Triangle, then operate as part of the Norbeck‚ÄìWheaton Line until the 1990s when it was replaced by Ride On route 48. Route Y5 would later join the Georgia Avenue‚ÄìMaryland Line. Route Y6 operated between Glenmont and Wheaton before being extended to Aspen Hill. Route Y7 would operate between Montgomery Village and Southwest Mall. Routes Y8 and Y9 would only operate between MedStar Montgomery Medical Center and Silver Spring. All routes would primarily operate along Georgia Avenue. During the 1980 to 1990s, routes Y5, and Y7 were rerouted to operate with routes Y8 and Y9 MedStar Montgomery Hospital and Silver Spring. Y6 would also join the line but would keep its same routing between Glenmont and Aspen Hill. =1990s= In the 1990s, route Y6 was renamed route Q3 which would operate on its same routing. The route was later replaced by Ride On route 41 in 1998. Y5 was also eliminated and replaced by routes Y7, Y8, and Y9. Since the 1990s, the Georgia Avenue‚ÄìMaryland Line operates as the following: * Y7: Montgomery General Hospital to Silver Spring via the Norbeck Park and Ride only. * Y8: Montgomery General Hospital to Silver Spring via Leisure World only. * Y9: Montgomery General Hospital to Silver Spring as a direct route. =2003 Changes= On September 7, 2003, route Y5 was reincarnated to operate between Montgomery General Hospital and Silver Spring via the Norbeck Park and Ride and Leisure World in order to supplement routes Y7, Y8, and Y9. =2011 Changes= On December 18, 2011, new service was added to the new Intercounty Connector Park and Ride Lot off Georgia Avenue. Routes Y5 and Y7 would enter the Park and Ride in order for passengers to transfer to MTA Maryland 201 and 202. Service to the Norbeck Park & Ride Lot was discontinued. =2012 Study= Route Y7 at Silver Spring station. Between 2011 and 2012, WMATA released a study on the Y lines. At the time, the Y line was suffering from insufficient run time, inconvenient service frequencies, and operational issues the line has. Proposals were to simplify the line, add time to schedule buses, combine bus stops together, improve amenities at bus stops, and convert route Y9 as a MetroExtra route. These changes will go under short to long term plans. At the time of the study, frequencies goes as the following: * Y5: Weekday Peak Hour service (AM to Silver Spring, PM to Olney) and Sunday service only. * Y7: Weekday Peak Hour service (AM to Silver Spring, PM to Olney) and late night Saturday service only. * Y8: Daily (except service in the Weekday Peak direction). Most Saturday service only operates between SIlver Spring and Leisure World. * Y9: Daily direct between Silver Spring and Olney. Most Sunday trips only operates between Medstar Montgomery Medical Center and Wheaton station. =August 2014 Changes= On August 24, 2014, routes Y5 and Y9 were discontinued by WMATA and replaced by routes Y7 and Y8 in order to simplify the Georgia Avenue‚ÄìMaryland Line. Route Y7 would also be shortened and rerouted to Georgia Ave‚ÄìICC Park & Ride Lot instead of MedStar Hospital while route Y8 would discontinue service to the Leisure World clubhouse remaining straight along Georgia Avenue. During the weekends, route Y7 would only operate between Leisure World clubhouse and Wheaton station. =Temporary Y4= Between October 14, 2014 and December 12, 2014, a temporary route Y4 was introduced as the Leisure World‚ÄìOlney Line running on weekdays between 8:00 AM and 3:00 PM in order to provide residents access to the Leisure World clubhouse from Olney. This was because residents lost direct access to the clubhouse on August 24, 2014 when the Y8 became a direct route. Passengers would have to walk from the clubhouse onto Georgia Avenue to take the Y8 instead of waiting at the bus stops as the Y7 would take them to Silver Spring or up to the Georgia Ave‚ÄìICC Park & Ride Lot on weekdays only. =December 2014 Changes= On December 14, 2014, a new route Y2 was introduced to operate a direct routing between MedStar Montgomery Medical Center and Silver Spring station which was the Y8 routing and former Y9 routing. Route Y8 was also rerouted back to the Leisure World clubhouse but discontinued all weekend service. Route Y4 was also discontinued as there was no need for the route to operate anymore as the Y8 covered the same routing. These changes were all towards customer feedback and frustration due to the August 24 changes. =September 2015 Changes= When the Paul S. Sarbanes Transit Center at Silver Spring station opened, routes Y2, Y7, and Y8 were rerouted from its terminus along Wayne Avenue to the new transit center. The Y2, Y7, and Y8 were assigned to Bus Bay 219 on level 2. =June 2017 Changes= On June 25, 2017, weekend route Y8 service was restored operating its full route. Route Y7 also discontinued weekend service on the same day being replaced by routes Y2 and Y8. This gives residents from Olney weekend service to the Leisure World clubhouse which has not happened since the 2014 changes. Incidents * On October 11, 2011, 52-year old Victor McEachin stabbed a Y7 bus driver at Wheaton station after he allegedly had inappropriate sexual behavior on board the bus. After a 26 year old women reported the incident to the driver, the driver told the man to respect other passengers, then began talking in a loud manner. After arriving at Wheaton station, the driver got off and McEachin began attacking the driver and the 26 year old woman. McEachin then attempted to punch the woman, then got into a physical altercation and stabbed the driver. The suspect later fled the scene but was later arrested nearby University Boulevard West and Amherst Avenue. The driver suffered minor injuries. McEachin was later convicted on May 2, 2012. * On May 11, 2020 around 9:30 PM, a passenger threatened a Y2 bus driver which caused the driver to be distracted and serve along Georgia Avenue and struck a sign on a Church lawn. No series injuries were reported and it's unknown if any arrests were made.

The AAFC aims to create spaces for identity exploration, political education, community building, and advocacy through the events, workshops, and resources that they provide. The AAFC has attributed their ability to think and act critically in community activism to the work of Black feminist thought and feminist movements in developing nations. Since 2018, the AAFC has published three zines: Building an Asian American Feminist Movement, How to Make History, and Care in the Time of Coronavirus. Common themes in their zines have included dissecting privilege and access, among other social issues.  History  In the surge of feminist resistance that helped launch the 2017 Women's March, AAFC's founding members (Julie Ae Kim, Rachel Kuo, Senti Sojwal, and Tiffany Diane Tso) noticed that women of color and their needs were often excluded or tokenized. The inaugural members of AAFC found it crucial that they help rekindle Asian American feminism and activism to insure the inclusion and representation of the needs of Asian American women, girls, and marginalized genders when it came to political resistance. In early 2017, they created an Asian American Feminism event series before launching the AAFC in September 2018.

Attack British Airways said the attack affected bookings from 21 August 2018 and 5 September 2018 with credit card details of around 380,000 customers being compromised. The attackers obtained names, street addresses, email addresses, credit card numbers, expiration dates and Ccard security codes - enough to allow thieves to steal from accounts. One customer of the airline reported that his card had been used to buy items by phone at Harrods while he was in Malaysia. The attempt was rejected - the customer did not think his card was exposed except by this attack. Aftermath British Airways urged customers to contact their banks or credit card issuer and to follow their advice. NatWest said that it received more calls than usual because of the breach. American Express said that customers would not need to take any action and that they would alert customers with unusual activity on their cards. Analysis The Information Commissioner's Office said that the attack had begun in June 2018. Consequences for British Airways British Airways was issued with a ¬£183 million fine by the Information Commissioner's Office, which was the biggest fine issued by the office up to that date. It was roughly 367 times the previous record, which was a ¬£500,000 fine imposed on Facebook over the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The Facebook fine was the heaviest that could have been imposed at the time - a new law mirroring GDPR had been introduced between the Facebook and British Airways scandals. The fine was 1.5% of the airline's worldwide turnover in 2017. The maximum under the new laws would have been 4% of worldwide turnover, which would have approached ¬£500 million. CEO and chairman √Ålex Cruz said the airline was \\"surprised and disappointed\\" in the ICO's finding. In October 2020 British Airways was fined ‚Ç§29 million by the Information Commissioner's Office, considerably smaller than the ¬£183 million fine that the ICO originally intended.

Christianity and Druze are Abrahamic religions that share a historical traditional connection with some major theological differences. The two faiths share a common place of origin in the Middle East, and consider themselves to be monotheistic. Christianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. Its adherents, known as Christians, believe that Jesus is the Christ, whose coming as the messiah was prophesied in the Old Testament, and chronicled in the New Testament. The primary scriptures of Christianity is the Bible.Olson, The Mosaic of Christian Belief. It is the world's largest religion with about 2.4 billion followers. Jethro of Midian is considered an ancestor of Druze, who revere him as their spiritual founder and chief prophet. It is a monotheistic and Abrahamic religion based on the teachings of Hamza ibn-'Ali ibn-Ahmad and the sixth Fatimid caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, and Greek philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Pythagoras, and Zeno of Citium. The Epistles of Wisdom is the foundational text of the Druze faith. Even though the faith originally developed out of Ismaili Islam, Druze do not identify as Muslim. The number of Druze people worldwide is between 800,000 and one million, with the vast majority residing in the Levant.  Religious comparison  In terms of religious comparison, mainstream Christian denominations do not believe in reincarnation or the transmigration of the soul, contrary to the beliefs of the Druze. Where the reincarnation is a paramount tenet in the Druze faith.Seabrook, W. B., Adventures in Arabia, Harrap and Sons 1928, (chapters on Druze religion) Christianity teaches evangelism, often through the establishment of missions, unlike the Druze who do not accept converts to their faith. Marriage outside the Druze faith is rare and is strongly discouraged. Similarities between the Druze and Christians include commonalities in their view of monogamous marriage and divorce, as well as belief in the oneness of God and theophany. The Druze faith incorporates some elements of Christianity, and other religious beliefs. Both faiths give a prominent place to Jesus: Jesus is the central figure of Christianity, and in the Druze faith, Jesus is considered an important prophet of God, being among the seven prophets who appeared in different periods of history. Both religions venerated John the Baptist, Saint George, Elijah, and other common figures.  History  Druze and Christian clerics in Israel. The relationship between the Druze and Christians has been characterized by harmony and coexistence, with amicable relations between the two groups prevailing throughout history, with the exception of some periods, including 1860 Mount Lebanon civil war. Fakhr-al-Din II (1572 ‚Äì 1635) was a Druze prince and a leader of the Mount Lebanon Emirate. Maronite Ab≈´ NƒÅdir al-KhƒÅzin was one of his foremost supporters and served as Fakhr-al-Din's adjutant. Phares notes that \\"The emirs prospered from the intellectual skills and trading talents of the Maronites, while the Christians gained political protection, autonomy and a local ally against the ever-present threat of direct Ottoman rule. After the Shehab dynasty converted to Christianity, the Druze lost most of their political and feudal powers. Also, the Druze formed an alliance with Britain and allowed Protestant Christian missionaries to enter Mount Lebanon, creating tension between them and the native Maronite Church. Approximately 10,000 Christians were killed by the Druze during inter-communal violence in 1860. The members of the Christian communities (Maronites, Eastern Orthodox, Melkite Catholic, and others) mixed with the Unitarian Druze, led to the presence of mixed villages and towns in Mount Lebanon, Jabal al-Druze,The Druze and Assad: Strategic Bedfellows the Galilee region, and Mount Carmel. The Maronite Catholic and the Druze founded modern Lebanon in the early eighteenth century, through the ruling and social system known as the \\"Maronite-Druze dualism\\" in Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate. A number of the Druze embraced Christianity, such as some of Shihab dynasty remembers,Mishaqa, p. 23. as well as the Abi-Lamma clan. During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Protestant missionaries established schools and churches in Druze strongholds, with some Druze converting to Protestant Christianity; yet they did not succeed to convert Druze to Christianity en masse. On the other hand, many Druze immigrants to the United States converted to Protestantism, becoming communicants of the Presbyterian or Methodist Churches. According to the Druze religious courts, between 1952 to 2009, around 10% of Israeli Druze who left the Druze faith converted to Christianity.Druze Identity, Religion ‚Äì Tradition and Apostasy By one estimate made by Elisabe Granli from University of Oslo, around 1,920 Syrian Druze converted to Christianity; according to the same study, Christians with a Druze background (Druze converts to Christianity) still regard themselves as Druze, and claim that there is no contradiction between being Druze and being Christian.

Cover art, 1977 Description War of the Star Slavers, designed by Dave Casciano, is a science fiction game in which players can take on the roles on one of two Empires, or become a Star Slaver. The game components are: * a scenario outline * two empire commerce charts * over 200 cardstock counters representing ships and cargos * four 12.75\\" x 10.5\\" hex maps representing a star cluster, totalling 114 hexes wide by 80 hexes long * a 12-page rule folder * a large 15\\" x 12\\" ziplock bag to hold the game =Setting= The Ascarian and Dracko Empires are weakened after a mutually destructive war. Despite their distrust of each other, they must trade, running cargo ships through the demilitarized zone. Here, undefended by either space navy, the cargo ships fall prey to the piratical Star Slavers. The four-section map delineates the star systems belonging to the two Empires, as well as features that will affect space travel like gas clouds and gravity wells. =Gameplay= The Empire players each have assorted warships and cargo ships, and their own timetable of commercial runs. Each Empire player tries to complete as many profitable runs as possible, vying to earn more money than the other Empire. Empire players can also try to hunt down Slavers, since one less Slaver means a better chance for their cargo to arrive safely. Each Star Slaver has an armed cruiser, and must intercept and destroy cargo ships in order to take their cargo. Once a Star Slaver has cargo, the ship can proceed to any planet in the Neutral Zone or one of the Empires to sell it. The Star Slaver will get a better price in one of the Empires, but at greater risk of being jumped by an Empire warship. Out of their earnings, Star Slavers must pay for their crew, as well as any necessary repairs to their ships. =Movement= There are two types of movement: * Rocket Movement, which moves any unit 1 hex per turn. * Hyper Jump, which moves a unit a varying amount according to its rating. A destroyer can jump 10 hexes, a freighter only 2 hexes. Hyper Jumps must be plotted three turns in advance. =Combat= Every ship has a certain number of Null guns, a number of defence shields, and an integrity rating. The difference between the number of Null guns attacking and the number of shields on the target is indexed against the range on the Combat Results Table (CRT). Each resultant hit reduces the target's Integrity by one. When a ship's Integrity reaches zero, it is destroyed, and its cargo is left in space to be picked up. =Diplomacy= Any player can make any agreement with any other player, as long as it doesn't contravene the game rules. Reviewer Gary Porter noted as an example that a Star Slaver could reach an agreement with the Ascarians to only attack Dracko ships. =Victory conditions= Victory conditions vary from scenario to scenario, but generally the two Empires try to outperform the other, and Slavers attempt to earn 200 credits of net profit in order to retire. Reception In the June-July 1977 edition of Moves (Issue 33), Phil Kosnett criticized the amateurish components, pointing out the \\"poorly hand drawn two color counters.\\" In the August-September 1977 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #2), Gary Porter was very critical of the game, stating, \\"War of the Star Slavers is a badly flawed game. Ignoring such minor flaws as ambiguous rules and woolly presentation, we are left with such problems as the movement rules which just don't work.\\" Porter also was not impressed by the quality of the components, pointing out that the ship counters are almost identical, meaning \\"players find themselves constantly cross-referring between board, rule book (where the profiles are defined), and scenario sheet (which contains the specs).\\" He admitted the game was \\"different and challenging,\\" but concluded by giving the game an extremely poor rating of only 3 out of 10.

Early life Valerie Place was born at 20 St Brendan's Crescent, Walkinstown, Dublin on 24 March 1969. She was the third child of Patrick, coachbuilder, and Margaret Place (n√©e Byrne). She had three brothers and three sisters. Place attended St Paul's secondary school, Greenhills, and was trained as a nurse at St. James's Hospital, Dublin from 1987 to 1990. She worked for a period with Caring and Sharing Association (CASA). Career Place went to Somalia in September 1992 as a volunteer worker on a two-year contract with Concern, the Irish overseas aid agency. Concern had been part of the international emergency response in Somalia since May 1992. Place was one of 70 Irish aid workers based in 17 locations across Somalia. She was the supervisor of a feeding station for 2,500 children and an adjoining school in Mogadishu. The aid workers worked with local guards, and later the Unified Task Force of 30,000 troops to secure the areas for the distribution of humanitarian relief. The task force struggled to protect the aid convoys from attacks from armed groups. Death and legacy Place was travelling in a party, which included Rev. Aengus Finucane, on 22 February 1993 to attend the opening of a school in Wanlewein for 1,200 when the party was ambushed. Place was fatally wounded when her car, the last in the convoy, was ambushed at Afgoi. She was airlifted to a military hospital in Mogadishu by a US Air Force helicopter, but died within minutes of her arrival there. Place's funeral at the Church of the Holy Spirit, Greenhills, Dublin was attended by 2,000 people, including Irish President Mary Robinson. Robinson had met Place during her visit to Somalia in October 1992. At the time of her death, Place was the second western aid worker killed in Somalia, after the death of Sean Devereux in January 1993. Place's death caused demands that the task force do more to protect aid workers and to disarm the Somali factions, as well as prompting fresh criticism of the UN mandate in its failure to support military intervention with political initiatives. As the situation worsened, American troops withdrew in March 1994, and the UN disengaged in March 1995. The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs founded the Valerie Place commemorative scholarship in March 1993, which brings Somali teachers and nurses to train in Ireland. In June 1997, St. James's Hospital school of nursing unveiled a portrait and a classroom dedicated to her memory. There is also a mural to Place in Mogadishu.

A viol player looks over the harpsichordist's shoulder to see the figured bass line. 18th century amateurs routinely realized accompaniments from figured bass. Realization is the art of creating music, typically an accompaniment, from a figured bass, whether by improvisation in real time, or as a detained exercise in writing. It is most commonly associated with Baroque music. Competent performers of the era were expected to realize a stylistically appropriate accompaniment from a mere harmonic sketch, called a figured bass, and to do it at sight. A system that allowed much flexibilty, it became a lost art, but was revived in the 20th century by scholar-performers. To realize a figured bass by writing down the actual notes to be played was (and is) a traditional exercise for students learning harmony and composition, and is used by music editors. It was rare for established composers of the Baroque era to write down realizations. With few exceptions, those that have survived are short teaching demonstrations, or else student exercises. From this exiguous material must present-day scholars seek to recover the styles of the period, which varied considerably from time to time and place to place. Concept Ex. 1 A figured bass line, and a realization for theorbo (Thomas Mace, 1676) (play) Audio simulation Ex. 2 Four realizations of a short figured bass (1753) (play) Ex. 3 A figured bass, and a guitar realization (Nicola Matteis, 1682) (play) Ex. 4 Bach MS: the keyboard part is thought to be an extremely rare transcription of a live Bach realization (play)p repeat on the lute stop. Caccini unfigured bass, Dowland realization (play) Ex. 6 Jacopo Peri: early voice and figured bass, and a continuo realization; (play) (a) without and (b) with keyboard realization Ex. 7 Harmony realized in the solo instrument itself (a) without (b) with the technique (play) Corelli sonata fragment (b) + continuo realization by Antonio Tonelli (play) Ex. 9 Duet for two viols, with optional harpsichord realization (Antoine Forqueray, 1747))The piece was designed for two viols and harpsichord, or any two of those: Without, and with, the harpsichord option (play) Composers of the Baroque era seldom wrote out the musical accompaniment (called the basso continuo, or simply continuo). Performers were expected to realizeThe word is thus spelled in both British and American English. one to suit the occasion, guided by no more than a bare sketch called a figured bass (or thorough bass). The figured bass consisted of a bass line written in normal staff notation, but marked with numerals or other symbols to indicate the harmony (see Ex. 1, first line). Indeed the entire Baroque period is sometimes referred to as the Figured Bass period. A basso continuo is analogous to the rhythm section of present-day jazz and popular bands; the figured bass, to the lead sheets used by such bands. However, realizing a figured bass has a challenging extra dimension. It is not enough that the correct harmonies (regarded as vertically stacked notes) be played: the notes must succeed each other horizontally according to certain voice leading rules, which in the Baroque era were quite strict.Performers are supposed to avoid consecutive fifths and octaves, duplication of the leading note, and many other pitfalls. Execution The realizer, while usually following the harmonic scheme indicated in the figuring, has a choice on such matters as rhythmic effect, chordal spacing, ornamentation, arpeggiation, imitation and counterpoint, limited only by sound judgement and good taste, and adherence to the genre's voice leading rules and stylistic conventions ‚Äî ideally, those of the composer's time and place. Ex. 2 shows four realizations of the same figured bass by the Baroque composer Francesco Geminiani. In early Baroque the bass was usually unfigured. However, by also considering the solo part the realizer could usually guess the harmonies ( Ex. 5). Baroque era scores were riddled with copyist's or printer's errors, and sometimes an error of judgement by the composer himself. Accordingly, the realizer had (and has) to be ready to spot these and correct them. Thus, not only the figured harmonies, but even the written bass line can occasionally be altered. Said C.P.E. Bach: Benefits John Butt has argued that figured bass is an instance of \\"purposely incomplete\\" notation conferring a positive advantage.. Accompaniments improvised from a figured bass line can be made to suit varying circumstances e.g. tempi, instrumentation, and even the hall acoustics. Further, wrote Robert Donington: > It was not from mere casualness that baroque composers preferred to trust > their performers with figured bass ... It was from the high value they set > on spontaneity. They believed, and modern experience confirms, that it is > better to be accompanied with buoyancy than with polished workmanship. An > accompanist who can give rhythmic impetus to his part, adapt it to the > momentary requirements of balance and sonority, thicken it here and thin it > there, and keep every bar alive, can stimulate his colleagues and help to > carry the entire ensemble along. This is not merely to fill in the harmony; > nor is it merely to make the harmony into an interesting part; it is to > share in the creative urgency of the actual performance. Drawbacks Since few realizations were written down, except by pupils, not many have survived; (A sonata movement by Bach ‚Äî Ex. 4 ‚Äî is believed to be a rare exception for this major composer.) Where one has survived, it is precious evidence on the style of that particular time and place. The notation \\"had this inherent defect ‚Äî that no one who had not heard a composer play from his own figured bass parts could know the precise effects he produced or intended\\" or contemplated (for styles and performing conventions varied much, not only from country to country, but from time to time). \\"... the vast terrain encompassed by the periods of Monteverdi and Mozart, the national styles of Italy, France, Germany and England, and the many different types of music that flourished in these lands in the 17th and 18th centuries. Well, of course no continuo player of the Baroque ever reckoned on having to manage all this; his style already existed where he lived, as did the musical idiom of the day, and all he had to be aware of ... was, whether he was in church, opera house or court concert\\": (Dalton, 1971). So when these realizing traditions were lost, a passage in figured bass was a dead letter, unless it could be somehow be revived by scholarship (see below). Writing as late as 1959 Benjamin Britten said: In actual performanceBaroque era= Keyboard accompaniments (e.g. harpsichord or organ) were meant to be spontaneously realized from the figured bass notation, the performer filling in the harmonic sketch as he went along. J.S. Bach wrote: Though keyboards have received most attention in the literature, there is abundant evidence the harmony was often realized by hand-plucked instruments e.g. lute, theorbo, guitar or harp (Exs. 1, 3, 5). Further, it was played chordally on the same cello that supplied the bassline; or even on the solo violin itself ‚Äî by double stopping (Ex. 7). Praetorius recommended a judicious selection of trombones, regals, flutes, violins, cornetts, recorders, \\"or a boy may sing the top line of all\\". Early operas were produced from a score containing, mostly, just the vocal parts and figured bass (as in Ex. 6, without keyboard realization); these were elaborated and ornamented by the performers . The harmonic sketch in figured bass was only meant to be a suggestion, wrote Marc Pincherle, adding: In Georg Philipp Telemann's understanding, \\"There are occasions when the accompanist may not wish to sound all the notes shown in the figuring. He is just as much within his rights in leaving out part of what is figured as he is in adding to what is figured.\\" Professionals To realize a figured bass at sight was an expected accomplishment for any professional accompanist, an essential part of his musical training. In 1761 the nine-year old Muzio Clementi, to qualify for an organ post in Rome, passed a test where candidates were given a figured bass and told to perform an accompaniment, after which they were obliged to transpose it into various keys. A top realizer had to be a master of composition, insisted Roger North (1710): > Altho a man may attain the art to strike the accords true to a thro-base > [thorough bass] prescribed him according as it is figured, yet he may not > pretend to be master of his part, without being a master of composition in > general, for there is occasion of so much management in ye manner of play, > sometimes striking only by accords, sometimes arpeggiando, sometimes > touching ye air, and perpetually observing the emphatick places, to fill, > forbear, or adorne, with a just favour, that a thro-base master, and not an > ayerist, is but an abecedarian. Even more demanding was partimento, in which composers were taught to improvise not just an accompaniment but a fully-fledged composition. Amateurs In the 18th century not just professionals were expected to accompany from a figured bass. Music handbooks for amateurs proliferated, and most of these contained figured bass instructions. Handel wrote a course in realization for the daughters of George II. It taught, not only how to improvise accompaniments, but even fugues. It is on sale today. Music publishing originated in 18th century Europe, and it did so to cater for a growing army of cultivated amateurs. \\"Everybody sang or played, and the experience of teaming up with others was enormous fun. Composers were more than happy to oblige by writing music that was within the grasp of these amateurs\\". The London publisher John Walsh ‚Äî who sometimes passed off spurious pieces as and for the works of Corelli, Handel or Telemann ‚Äî routinely issued his productions with figured basses. \\"Indeed, the chief consumers of the sonatas of Corelli and his imitators were not professional musicians but rather the gentlemen members of amateur music clubs. Walsh would have been able to count on a public of aristocratic and middle-class amateurs\\". File:Title page from Handel's 'Saul'.pngWalsh's Handel for amateurs, 1740 File:Author of Peace.png(Inside) Vocal part, with nothing but figured bass File:The property of a lady, 1718.pngThe property of a lady, 1718 Some amateurs were outstanding, wrote Mary Cyr:One such woman was the unusually gifted Princess Anne, Handel's lifelong friend, whose continuo realizations impressed. For fashionable young ladies who only wanted to acquire the art as a social skill, there were tutors that taught a quick pragmatic way to play a continuo ‚Äî of sorts. Although not considered very elegant, a player could usually get by by arpeggiation, (illustrated in Ex. 9). The ability of some amateurs to play from figured bass, and even direct an orchestra from the keyboard, persisted into the early Classical period. In the United States, familiarity persisted farther. Not only could amateurs be found who could play from figured bass, but briskly selling tune books ‚Äî of popular music ‚Äî were routinely published with figured bass parts, until the middle of the 19th century. =Disuse= After the Baroque era the art died out.Except among some English cathedral organists who continued to practise it up to the early 20th century: ; ; . By the time of the popular revival of J.S. Bach's music (by Mendelssohn, 1829) the performing traditions had been forgotten; musicians took no account of Bach's figured basses; they played him without a continuo realization ‚Äî sometimes with grotesque results.\\"The public was treated to a dialogue between a contrabass and a flute, or even to a contrabass monologue\\" (Schweitzer, 1923b). Here and there a Brahms could be found who was adept at continuo improvisation but the ordinary competent musician demanded a realized score. In 1949 William J. Mitchell wrote: \\"The extemporaneous realization of a figured bass is a dead art. We have left behind us the period of the basso continuo and with it all the unwritten law, the axioms, the things that were taken for granted; in a word, the spirit of the time\\". That year American harpsichordist and musicologist Putnam Aldrich tried to revive the practice at a Pierre Monteux rehearsal of \\"absolutely authentic\\" Bach: But a revival of the art of live realization was underway. =Modern revival= Already in 1935 the highly successful recordings of the Brandenburg Concertos by the Busch Chamber Players had a continuo realization. Their 1948 Kingsway Hall concerts were the highlights of the London season; audiences, reported Adolf Aber, felt here, at last, was the music of Bach and Handel as it was meant to be performed. even though it had no pretence to be historically informed ‚Äî just plain, unobtrusive chords on a grand piano sounded by Rudolf SerkinBest heard in e.g. the 2nd movement of Brandenburg Concerto No.2 in F. which may or may not have been written down in advance. Interest in improvising historically informed realizations of figured bass was first revived by amateurs in England. The early music pioneer Arnold Dolmetsch's The Interpretation of the Music of the XVIIth and XVIIIth Centuries (1915) had a chapter on realizing figured bass, richly illustrated with historical examples. Dolmetsch advocated spontaneity before academic pedantry. Thus, a \\"noble\\" specimen by Michael Praetorius was \\"just right for effect; but it would not get a high number of points in a musical examination\\". Ex. 10 A realization in an embellished style, 1697 (play) Ex. 11 A figured bass, and three realizations by Georg Muffat, illustrating the \\"thicker\\" style (play) In 1931 Franck Thomas Arnold, who like Dolmetsch was a self-taught scholar, published his pioneeringThe Art of Accompaniment from a Thorough-bass: As Practised in the XVIIth & XVIIIth Centuries. Wrote Arnold: Highly acclaimed by scholars and criticsSee the main article F. T. Arnold ‚Äî Ernest Newman said it was \\"the finest piece of musicography ever produced\\" in England ‚Äî Arnold's book was studied by a new breed of historically informed scholar-performers, including American Ralph Kirkpatrick and Janny van Wering and Ton Koopman in the Netherlands. Other works were Thurston Dart, The interpretation of music (London, 1954); Robert Donington, The interpretation of early music (London, 1963);; and Peter Williams, Figured Bass Accompaniment (Edinburgh, 1970), of which a reviewer wrote, \\"So far as any sense can be made of a subject the essence of which is that it be not written down, Dr Williams has done it\\". By the end of the 20th century the scene had been transformed. Wrote American harpsichordist and editor Doris Ornstein: \\"[Thurston] Dart lived long enough to see his book, teaching, and personal example create a whole new breed of scholar-performers who can create stylish realizations. (In England, continuo playing is practically a cottage industry!)\\" . Already by the late 1960s the lost art had been recovered by a number of harpsichord players, of which Gustav Leonhardt was the most prominent.. Under his direction the Conservatorium van Amsterdam abolished the written paper requiring the realization of a figured bass line, in favour of a practical one. By 2013 the Conservatorium was offering a degree course in Basso Continuo Specialization, the first institute in the world to do so; a Master's degree was available. It was objected, however, that practitioners had evolved a 'generic' basso continuo style characteristic of the late-20th century. Described by Lars Ulrik Mortensen as modest, discreet and unobtrusive, it was not what Baroque practioners necessarily did.. Some would have played a \\"full-voiced\\" (thicker) style, for example (Exs. 8, 11) or an embellished style (Ex. 10). No real Baroque-era musician could have managed the diversity of styles and idioms that flourished in different lands and at different times in the period, concerning which specific knowledge is patchy. These required a new generation of specialist scholar-performers. In writing Ex. 12 Increasing intricacy made spontaneous realization too demanding. (play) Without and with keyboard realization As a detained exercise in writing, figured bass has been realized when performers could not improvise, or as a teaching exercise, or when music publishers wanted to supply a pre-realised product. Towards the end of the Baroque era, wrote Ernio Stipƒçeviƒá Bach's BWV 1097 was composed at the end of the Baroque era. Though it has a figured bass, its harmonies are demanding. Ex. 12 contains a written out realization by Bach's former pupil Johann Kirnberger . =Music publishing= Ex. 13a Realization of a Handel continuo by Brahms, of the 'Romantic' factionQuoted in . (play) Ex. 13b By Robert Franz, a 'Hegelian' who had sneered at Brahms' effortQuoted in . (play) Figured basses are realized by editors of performing editions when performers cannot or do not wish to do it by themselves. The early music revival in mid 19th century Germany, which by now had the most sophisticated music publishing industry in the world, created a demand for editions with pre-realized continuos since most performers did not know how to realize figured bass any more. As to that, two philosophical schools were bitter rivals, and nowhere did they clash more fiercely than on how to realize figured bass. The 'Romantic' school venerated the past, revering it for its own sake. Adherents included Friedrich Chrysander, Philipp Spitta, and Heinrich Bellermann. Their most impressive achievement was the Bach-Gesellschaft complete edition of J.S. Bach's works, \\"based on the original sources and with no changes, cuts, or additions\\" ‚Äî hence, with figured basses, but no realizations. They were jeered by the rival school for being mere musicologists with no artistic creativity. To refute this, in 1870 Chrysander published an edition of Handel songs in which the figured basses were realized by indisputably talented musicians, including Johannes Brahms ‚Äî one of their supporters. The contending 'Hegelian' school believed that deep historical laws ensured that art manifested itself in increasingly perfect forms, and so early music ought to be modernised for present-day audiences. They sincerely believed they owed it to the music, since they were only doing what Bach, Handel, and so forth, would have done themselves, had they been alive to do it. Members of this school included Robert Franz, Selmar Bagge and Julius Schaeffer. The Handel songs edition attracted their scorn. Franz penned a highly critical open letter in which, amongst other things, he caught out Brahms in the sin of writing a number of parallel fifths and octaves (\\"Handel's style allows for no schoolboy mistakes\\", he mocked) ‚Äî which touched Brahms on a raw nerve.. In 1882 Franz himself brought out an edition of some of the same Handel songs. Unlike Brahms, Franz's realizations were florid and obtrusive (Exs. 13a vs. 13b). This dichotomy meant that, for generations after its revival, either Bach's music was published without any realizations, ‚Äî often being performed with no continuo at all, therefore ‚Äî or else with historically inauthentic realizations, criticised for being \\"purely fantastic\\", \\"strangely unreal\\", \\"ruthlessly corrupted\\", \\"heavy, pianistic, and with a strangely nineteenth-century flavour\\", just \\"a few dull chords\\", or as conceited, pushy, usurping the composer's function. Modern editorial realizations, when they are provided at all, depend for their success on sound judgement and careful scholarship. There may be a dilemma. Said one modern editor: \\"A good realization depends on scholarship, imagination, sympathy with the soloist, familiarity with every nuance of the text, and consideration of the varying circumstances of performance\\"; and, for her eidition, she went to the extent of imagining a specific performance with a particular singer and the sonorities of a particular harpsichord, which, logically, could have implied a single performance and a single sale. Already this dilemma had been faced by Brahms, who believed that \\"[ideally] each individual realization should be made with a view to a particular performance, taking into account specific forces, instruments, and location. =Teaching and exams= A realization by Thomas Attwood, Mozart's favourite pupil, with Mozart's remarks in English e.g. 'bad bar' and 'come to morrow at three' Ex. 14 A realization by one of Bach's pupils (blue notes), as corrected by his teacher (play) J.S. Bach's pupils were routinely given a single melody line with a figured bass and told to realize a four-part chorale. Or he made them realise figured basses by Italian composers (Ex. 14). Only when they had mastered these exercises were they allowed to compose their own bass lines and harmonies.. Such pedagogical methods were commonplace in the 18th century. Thomas Attwood, while Mozart's pupil, was made to realize figured basses. Once Attwood had acquired confidence, Mozart challenged him with a very chromatic figured bass ‚Äî it swiftly progressed from the key of C to C#. (Back in England, these papers were passed on reverently from master to favourite pupil for several generations.) However, after the Baroque era ‚Äî when basso continuo was employed no longer ‚Äî the original purpose was lost sight of, since these educational methods had acquired a momentum of their own, carried on anyway by sheer inertia. Realization of figured bass became a puzzle-solving skill in its own right, bearing no relation to practical musicianship. Realizing a figured bass was a routine exam question; marks were impartially deducted for academic faults regardless of their artistic significance, if any. George Bernard Shaw recalled having to do those exercises: By 1932 R.O. Morris could say \\"Figured Bass as a means of teaching harmony is now universally discredited.\\" See also Partimento References and notesSources         * *.             * * Category:Accompaniment Category:Baroque music Category:Historically informed performance Category:Music education Category:Music history Category:Musical improvisation ","title":"Realization (figured bass)"},{"id":"64016563","text":"Mike Mourant (born 21 July 1962) is a Canadian diver.

They played important religious and political roles in the history of Sylhet, Bengal and the subcontinent. Jitu Miah, the last jagirdar of the family, died in 1925 without leaving behind an heir. However the family estate managed by the local government, continued to be a prominent landmark in the town and a legacy of the family. History Maulvi Kalim Faruqi is generally considered to be the founder of the family. Faruqi was a student and successor (khalifah) of the 18th-century Urdu poet Mirza Mazhar Jan-e-Janaan of Delhi. Faruqi was considered to have been a scholar of hadith. Mawlana Azmi, author of a history book on Hadith in Bengal, peculiarly attributed the suffix Sylheti to Faruqi suggesting the family may have had connections with the Sylhet region this early on; either originating from there or inhabiting there. Faruqi's grandson was Maulvi Abu Nasr Muhammad Idris Khan who was also a scholar of hadith. Idris moved to Sylhet during the Nawabi period to work as a Qadi and subjudge. Historian Achyut Charan Choudhury claims Idris migrated from a region south of Sylhet known as Tripura where he and his forefathers lived. Idris was the Sadr-us Sudur of Bengal and wrote a sharh (commentary) on Al-Suyuti's Jam' al- Jawami. Idris had two sons who were both authors and alims; Abu Muhammad Abdul Qadir and Maulana Abul Husayn Abdur Rahman Ziya (d. 1893). Maulvi Abu Muhammad Abdul Qadir was a respected Mawlana, judge and celebrated polyglot writer. Some of Abdul Qadir's notable books include Ad-Durrul Azhar Fi Sharh il-Fiqh il-Akbar, Ar-Radd ul-Makul Ala an-Nahjil Maqbul (a book opposing the Wahhabi Movement), Al-Fawaid al-Qadiriya Fi Sharh al-Aqaidin Nasfiyyah (Arabic) and Al-Jawami Al-Qadiriya Fi Mutaqid Ahl is-Sunnah wal-Jamaat (Arabic, c. 1818), Kashful Qadir Fi Sharh al-Jami as-Saghir (unpublished manuscript). He was praised by Siddiq Hasan Khan, a nawab of the Bhopal State for his works. The first editions of his books Tafsir-e-Qadiriya (Persian) and Khulasatul Masail (Urdu, 1865) were in Kanpur and last editions circulated in 1969 by the Karachi Education Press. In 1886, he published the Urdu book Makhzanul Irfan Min Sunuis Subhan in Agra. Khan Bahadur Maulvi Abu Nasr Muhammad Yahia, commonly known by his sobriquet Jitu Miah, was born in either 1848 or 1851 in the family home in Sheikghat, Sylhet. Yahia first started working as a sub- registrar under the British Raj. From 1897 to 1903, he was vice-chairman and honorary magistrate of the Sylhet Municipality (now Sylhet City Corporation). As part of the 1924 New Year Honours, King George V awarded Yahia with the First Class Kaisar-i-Hind Medal in St James's Palace for his public services in British India. Yahia's first wife was his paternal first cousin, Sara Khatun. Sara died shortly after. Yahia later married the daughter of Khwaja Rasul Baksh of the Nawab family of Dhaka. She also died not long after and Yahia had no descendants. Yahia was said to have more wives later on from whom he had many children which he never publicly admitted. However, to preserve the existence of his estate, before his death in 1925, he made his estate a waqf with authorisation from the Government of Assam. The Sylhet District administrator became the mutawalli of the K B Yahia Waqf Estate. When Sylhet was upgraded to the divisional level, the mutawalli was the administrator of the Sylhet Division. He was said to have donated 60% of his wealth to social, religious and educational institutions and charities. Estate Abdul Qadir built the first family house in 1886 located in what is now the cow-haat of Kazir Bazar. The estate was damaged during and after the earthquake of 1897. In 1911, a two-storey Mughal-style building, made of limestone and powdered brick-dust, was built by his son, Yahia, in the front part of the estate, known as Yahia Villa. The ground floor acted as a drawing room and contains hand-calligraphy of the Quran and Hadith collected by Yahia. The entire floor has an area of 5523.959 square metres On top of the right side of this room is another room which contains a long black table and 20 chairs. This room acted as a meeting room. Many politicians, scholars and influential people visited, stayed in and were invited to the estate such as Mahatma Gandhi, Khwaja Salimullah, Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, Muhammed Saadulah, Khwaja Nazimuddin, Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani, Yusuf Ali Chowdhury, Hussain Ahmed Madani, Badshah Mian (descendant of Haji Shariatullah) and M. A. G. Osmani. The Government also gave rights for the possession of guns in the estate. =Legacy= Yahia became notable for his philanthropic works and the family estate became so famed during his time that it continues to be locally known today as Jitu Miyar Bari (Jitu Miah's house) and officially as Yahia Villa. A popular old proverb about the Sylhet city mentions the house: . This translates to \\"Chandnighat's stairs, Ali Amjad's Clock, Bangku Babu's beard and Jitu Miah's house\\". Rajon Das later did some conservation work for the building. It was proposed in 2019 that this historical house be a place to conserve the culture and history of the region by making it the headquarters of the Department of Archaeology's Sylhet Divisional Archaeological Museum.

The battery was constructed in 1915 at Braefoot Point, then part of the Earl of Moray‚Äôs Donibristle Estate. The site is situated between the new town of Dalgety Bay and Aberdour in Fife. Forth defence lines In the First World War three lines of defence were established on the Firth of Forth to protect Rosyth Naval Dockyard, then home to the Battle Cruiser Fleet. These lines of defence were known as the Outer, Middle and Inner Defence Lines. War Office chart showing the three Forth Defence Lines in WW1 The Outer Line ran from a gun battery at Kinghorn to a battery at Leith Docks, with fortified gun emplacements on the island of Inchkeith. The Middle Line of defence ran from Braefoot Battery in the North to a battery on Cramond Island in the South, with fortified gun emplacements on the islands of Inchcolm and Inchmickery. The Inner Line of defence was situated close to the Forth Bridge, with batteries at Downing Point on the North coast and Hound Point on the South coast of the river. Additional batteries were located at Carlingnose Point, Dalmeny, and on the island of Inchgarvie. Each line of defence also had an associated anti-submarine boom. Battery specification A 9.2 inch gun emplacement on Gibraltar during WW2, the same type of gun was employed at the Braefoot Battery The Braefoot Battery was equipped with two large calibre naval gun emplacements, designed to engage any large enemy surface vessels threatening ships at anchor in the Firth of Forth and the naval facilities at Rosyth Dockyard. Each gun emplacement housed a BL 9.2-inch Mk IX ‚Äì X naval gun which could fire a shell weighing 55kg out to range of 26km. The battery was manned by local men of the Territorial Royal Garrison Artillery The coast guns were such an important part of the defence of the country that considerable efforts were made to protect them from landings of enemy troops that might put them out of action. The battery had a defended perimeter comprising, from inside out, a firing trench, a 10 foot high ‚Äòpalisade‚Äô fence, and a barbed wire entanglement. The barrack building was heavily fortified and the outward facing side contained firing loop holes. The site was also surrounded by a ring of six blockhouses inland and along the shore. History According to official records, approval had been given before the war for the construction of a battery of 9.2-inch guns at Braefoot and formal plans were drawn up by the War Office in 1912. Authority to proceed with construction was given in July 1914 and orders were placed for the guns, carriages and other equipment. Mounting pedestals for the guns arrived at Aberdour Station in January 1915 however they did not reach the battery until May. The two guns were mounted on 28 May and 6 July 1915. Later in the war the fleet anchorages moved East of the Forth Bridge and consequently the defensive lines were also moved Eastwards. It was suggested that the guns be removed to the battery at Kinghorn, but permission for this was not given. However, in October 1917 the guns were ordered to be dismounted and stored ready for reallocation - with one gun sent to Portsmouth in December. Current status Remains of Emplacement B, one of the 9.2 inch gun emplacements at Braefoot Battery, site now overgrown Today much of the Braefoot Battery remains and can be accessed by the public. The battery site, and the clear view over the River Forth from the gun emplacements, is now obstructed by a post war woodland plantation. Braefoot Plantation is owned by ExxonMobil who operate the adjacent LPG Tanker Terminal but public access is permitted through the Scottish Outdoor Access Code. The location is popular with walkers and a substantial (but unofficial) mountain bike trail has been constructed in the surrounding woodland. Although the actual guns are now long gone, the gun emplacements and all of the battery buildings are still present (although now bricked up for public safety).

He established his independent record label 100% Electronica in 2015, and in 2019 launched the first vaporwave music festival, 100% ElectroniCON. Biography George Clanton was born in Richmond, Virginia. He grew up going to punk rock shows. His career began when he accidentally downloaded a misnamed Brian Jonestown Massacre song, which led him down an Internet rabbit hole where he discovered \\"a whole new world of music\\" which inspired him to write and release his own under the pseudonym Mirror Kisses, and later ESPRIT Á©∫ÊÉ≥. He decided to start using his real name before releasing his album 100% Electronica, because \\"[he] didn't want to release one more album as Mirror Kisses\\", and he \\"hated saying 'Mirror Kisses' every time someone asked [him his] band name.\\" He tried to make a sequel to 100% Electronica for three years but felt that he failed, because he wasn't being able to find the sound he wanted for it. After giving up, he started experimenting and writing stuff for fun and felt that the \\"songs [were writing] themseves\\". Eventually, this material transformed into his next album, Slide, where he incorporated electric guitar and acoustic drums as well. In 2015 he established his record label 100% Electronica along with his girlfriend, fellow musical artist Negative Gemini. He and Negative Gemini both hail from Virginia and played their first show together in 2011 along with other artists such as Skylar Spence. In 2019, they launched 100% Electronicon, the first vaporwave music festival. Clanton streams his live performances regularly on Twitch and YouTube. He described New York City as his favorite city in the world to perform. Clanton has a degree in anthropology and taught himself computer science in order to create virtual interactive experiences for his record label. Songwriting process and style George Clanton's music has been described as a fusion of electropop, trip hop, and vaporwave, while also using elements of grunge, acid house, and shoegazing. Critics have also associated his music with chillwave and hypnagogic pop. Clanton noted that unlike some vaporwave artists, he does not try to be \\"ironic\\" or \\"silly with his lyrics\\", and prefers to \\"write great pop songs that are representative of an emotion that [he] actually [feels] when [he's] singing them.\\" He described his album Slide as a \\"vaporwave opera\\". When he finds a sound that he likes, he uses it as often as he can, believing it helps him make his albums sound more cohesive and iconic. Clanton's aim is for his music to evoke \\"nostalgia\\". When he starts writing a song, he randomly presses notes on his keyboard instrument and cycles through patches and effects until they trigger emotions and memories on him. Although he is frequently associated with vaporwave, Clanton himself states that he embraces the tag purely for marketing purposes, and does not consider himself strictly a vaporwave musician. Vaporwave is primarily an instrumental genre, which contradicts Clanton's use of vocals. His only conscious attempt at the genre was with the ESPRIT Á©∫ÊÉ≥ sideproject. Influences George Clanton's influences include Seal, Anton Newcombe, The Prodigy, New Order, and 311, which was the first band he saw live. Clanton collaborated with 311's Nick Hexum on several songs which they released in 2019, as well as a full album in 2020.

The islets are also visible from Horta, Faial, and from the ferries which travel regularly between Horta and Madalena. Locally, the shorter of the two islets is known as Ilh√©u Deitado (\\"Lying Down\\" Islet), while the taller islet is known as Ilh√©u em P√© (\\"Standing Up\\" Islet). Geography The Madalena Islets are the exposed remains of a submarine volcano which have been eroded by the sea and seismic activity over the ages. The space between the two islets is the old volcanic crater formed of tuff rock and is approximately deep. The rocks are composed mainly of compacted palagonite tuff. Surrounding waters include sandy clearings and areas of small sea-eroded rocks called calhau rolado (\\"rolled pebbles\\") in Portuguese. Ilh√©u Deitado is approximately in height and Ilh√©u em P√© is approximately tall. =Biome= Terrestrial plants present on the islets include endemic Azorean flowering plants such as Spergularia azorica and vid√°lia (Azorina vidalii). Aquatic plants growing in the waters around the islets include the brown alga Sphacelaria plumula, and the red algae Lithophyllum incrustans and Pterocladiophila capilacea. Various marine birds shelter on the islets, including common tern, Cory's shearwater, Eurasian whimbrel, grey heron, Kentish plover, roseate tern, ruddy turnstone, and sanderling. The waters surrounding the islets are home to common bottlenose dolphins, Atlantic bonito, groupers, and needlefish. Since June 1995 the Madalena Islets have been recognized as a protected Natura 2000 site by the European Environment Agency under the Habitats Directive. There are ongoing efforts to formally protect the islets locally as one of the protected areas of the Azores, thus far unsuccessful. Experienced scuba divers may visit the islets, particularly the small bay between them. Divers should exercise immense caution leaving this protected bay due to the strong currents in the Faial-Pico Channel, and so as to avoid the ferries and other vessels plying the channel.

It was originally located in a room on the second floor of 37 Church Street and was named for the room's large window. One of these women was Elsa Br√§ndstr√∂m Ulich, a Swedish-immigrant nurse and philanthropist.  Background  In 1939, four women opened the Window Shop at 37 Church Street with a combined sum of 65 dollars to aid immigrants fleeing German-occupied Europe who needed jobs, housing, and English education. At first, the Shop served as a consignment shop where immigrant women could sell their handicrafts and homemade baked goods, but after moving to 102 Mt. Auburn Street in November 1939, it was able to open a tea room and pastry shop, and within a year, was serving lunch. It would also eventually contain a dress and gift shop. Shop revenue was used to pay employees, who were mostly immigrants or refugees. During the 1940s, the Shop became one of the first businesses in Cambridge to hire African-Americans. The Window Shop created jobs for and trained hundreds of people in various skills, such as salesclerks, dressmakers, bakers, etc. Employee schedules were based on their own needs and availability, and not at the whim of the Shop. The Shop was also concerned with working conditions, wages, and providing benefits not required by law, which made it a progressive employer for the time. The Window Shop also was funded in part by, and cooperated with, the New England Christian Committee for Refugees (NECCR). In addition to providing a space for immigrants to work and make money, The Window Shop also provided scholarships to children of employees and emergency assistance funds. In January of 1942, Frances Fremont-Smith (wife of Frank Fremont-Smith), opened a Friendship House, where immigrants and refugees could attend lectures, sing, check out books from a lending library, and get information about other events around town one day a week, while enjoying refreshments. However, due to lack of funding, the Friendship House closed after a year of operation. Due to lack of space, The Window Shop relocated, for the last time, to 56 Brattle Street in 1947. The new building, constructed in 1811 for Torrey Hancock, had previously been the Cock Horse Inn, Dexter Pratt's Blacksmith Shop (made famous by the Henry Wadsworth Longfellow poem \\"The Village Blacksmith\\"), and after The Window Shop sold it in 1972, it was the Hi-Rise Bakery and then the Cambridge Center for Adult Education. The Window Shop restaurant would, at times, serve around 8,000 customers a day, but by the late 1960s, patron usage declined, and despite rebranding the Shop restaurant with a new manager and a Viennese Cafe, The Window Shop had to sell out and close in 1972. After closure, The Window Shop changed its name to The Window Shop, Inc. Scholarship Fund, which was incorporated in 1942, and it continued to offer scholarships to \\"new Americans\\" until 1987. In 1987, The Window Shop Inc., Scholarship Fund dissolved, with board members deciding that it outlived its usefulness and deeming that other Cambridge institutions could carry out their work. After dissolution, the Fund left its name and some assets to Northeastern University to give to refugee students. Other funds were given to former employees, some were designated for the processing of their archival materials at the Schlesinger Library, and some for a future history written on The Window Shop. The majority of the assets, however, went to The Boston Foundation to assist with refugees and foreign-born residents.

Biography Passovoy was born in Paterson, New Jersey. She was ahead of her time in the early 1960s, both on the court and in life. Her tennis skills earned her a place in collegiate tennis history and a place in her school's sports history as a female who competed on the 1963 men's tennis team at Orange State College (now known as California State University, Fullerton) and lettered on the team in her senior class year. At the time she was a married mother of three children. Passovoy remains the only female in the school's sports history to letter on a male varsity sport's program at the school. She accomplished this by beating players already on the Titans' team in challenge matches with her powerful forehand groundstroke and serving skills. There was no Titans' women's tennis team until three years later when the program began in 1966. If Passovoy wanted to play, it had to be on the men's tennis team. The team's number one singles player that year was Mike Bouck who had transferred after playing one year of collegiate tennis at UCLA for legendary Bruin head coach J.D. Morgan with four all-American teammates including Allen Fox on a team that was highly ranked nationally in collegiate men's tennis. Stan Smith, brother of C. Ken Smith ('63), was also a member on the 1963 Titan team.

Derevensky also has publications in different literary magazines and collective books.  Biography  Boris Derevensky was born on 30 June 1962, in a family of an electrical engineer in the Kentau (South of Kazakhstan}. He was the elder of two brothers. His father's bloodline included Ural Cossacks. In 1981‚Äì1986, he studied at Abai Kazakh National Pedagogical University (Alma Ata); his major was history and Soviet law. After graduating, he worked as a staff correspondent in such newspapers as \\"Kentau‚Äôs truth\\", \\"Shymkent Panorama\\" and as a news anchor at \\"Ikar\\" TV studio in Kentau. It was the time of his first literary experience as well. His debut as a writer took place in 1991 in Shimkent, when his booklet \\"Afterworld: Legends. Evidence. Facts‚Äù came out. At the same time, he became interested in the history of the ancient world. In 1996, ‚ÄúLenizdat‚Äù published his novels ‚ÄúHerod and Cleopatra‚Äù and ‚ÄúFatale Monstrum‚Äù, both dedicated to famous Egyptian empress Cleopatra VII. His historical essay ‚ÄúWomen at the fate of Marc Anthony\\" was printed in the appendix of the novel. The same year, he started working with Historical reliability of the Gospels and wrote a novella in two parts \\"Pilate\\" (1996) and several short stories. However, what Boris considered to be the most important was the publication of an omnibus of historical documents dedicated to Jesus Christ. After laborious work of gathering and translating the materials (part of which had never been published before), the omnibus \\"Jesus Christ in the Documents of History\\" came out in 1998 in Saint-Petersburg Publishing House \\"Aletheia\\". Impartially, as a true researcher, Derevensky published it, providing detailed commentaries to various documents: evidences of Jewish, Greek and Roman writers of the 1st and 2nd centuries; extracts from the works of early Christian authors; stories from New Testament apocrypha; messages from Talmud and Midrash. A separate chapter was dedicated to Muslim literature, which narrated about Prophet ‚ÄòIsa Ibn Maryam. Many fabrications on the subject of Gospel were also included in this book. During interviews and discussions, Derevensky claimed that this book should be a desk book for Biblical scholars and everyone who is interested in the History of Christianity.All about Jesus. Israel Shamir‚Äôs article (1999) Indeed, the omnibus was accepted by a large readership with great interest.Review of A.V. Seregin on an anthology of \\"Jesus Christ in the Documents of History\\" Bulletin of Ancient History. 2002, ‚Ññ 1. P. 189‚Äì201. This book has been quoted from by historians specializing in Christianity, as well as by divines. However, the book has also drew criticism from those who were not happy with the fact that many apologetic statements were there along with antichristian extracts from the Talmud sources, which happened to be the historical documents. The omnibus included three versions of translation of the Jewish anti-Gospel \\"Toledot Yeshu\\" ‚Äì something that had never been published in Russia before (see also: Yeshu). The 5th, extended and revised edition of the omnibus (2007) considers almost all critical comments and suggestions which were found in the scientific literature. ‚ÄúDoctrine of Antichrist in ancient times and Middle Ages\\" (2000) is another work by Derevensky, which also attracted the attention of historians and divines. It seemed natural that, after writing about the figure of Christ, the theologian-writer turned to the figure of His hell-twin ‚Äì the Antichrist. In 2007, the Saint-Petersburg Publishing House \\"Amphora\\" published the revised edition of this work ‚Äì \\"The book of Antichrist\\".Portal- Credo.Ru By this time, Publishing House \\"Amphora\\" became quite aware of Derevensky's attraction to Islam and his respect towards Muslim tradition. In 2009, this Publishing House published one more omnibus of documents: ‚ÄúMuslim Jesus. Gospel tradition in Islam‚Äù.Muslim Jesus. Amphora, 2009 In an atmosphere of strained relations between the West and East civilizations, when in the Western eye Islam became a hostile, aggressive religion, Derevensky tried to show how close Islam and Christianity in actuality are to each other (\\"Islam is as close to Christianity as no other religion\\"), how much the Muslims had embraced from Gospel legends and how much they were imbued with the doctrine of the Messiah-Christ.

He joined Anubhava Mantapa, the hall created by Basava, where every caste was welcome.  History  Haralayya was born in Kalyan, Karnataka. He was a cobbler and an ardent follower of Basava, who founded Lingayatism. He married Kalyanamma, who was also a follower of Basava. Once he met Basava on the streets and greeted him, eliciting a polite reply Basava. Haralayya was dumb struck that he was greeted so courteously by the king's treasurer. Later he regretted that he did not answer Basava's greeting and failed to show humility. So he and Kalyanamma decided to offer footwear made from their own skin to Basava. But Basava refused to accept the gift, because he did not regard himself worthy. On his way back home, Haralayya met Madhavarasa, a Brahmin minister of Kalchuris, who tried to snatch the shoes and take them with him, but because of this misdeed, he contracted leprosy. His maid took him to Haralayya to cure him, and after bathing in water from Haralayya's tank, he healed. Madhavarasa apologized to him and took 'Istalingadiksha' and became a follower of Lingayatism. Basava arranged the marriage of Madhavarasa's daughter, Lavanya, to Haralayya's son, Sheelavantha, which resulted in strong opposition by Bijjala II, the ruler of Southern Kalachuris. Offended by the decision, he killed both Madhavara and Haralayya's family.  In popular culture  In 2014, Kannada film director Purushottam directed the movie Mahasharana Haralayya, chronicling the story of Haralayya's life.

He also worked briefly in the diplomatic service of the Holy See, as Apostolic Delegate to Mexico from 1921 to 1923 and Apostolic Delegate to Constantinople from 1923 to 1925. Biography Ernesto Eugenio Filippi was born on 17 May 1879 in Collelongo, Italy. He was ordained a priest on 21 September 1901. On 22 July 1921, Pope Benedict XV appointed him titular archbishop of Serdica and Apostolic Delegate to Mexico. He received his episcopal consecration on 7 August 1921. He initially established cordial relations with the government, but was quickly drawn into the contentious relationship between the Church hierarchy and the anti-clerical political establishment. The government was enforcing a ban on political movements with a religious affiliation, which restricted the ability of Catholic lay associations to advocate for change in Church-state relations. In response, clandestine Catholic associations were operating with the almost universal support of the Mexican bishops and sometimes under their leadership. Filippi was suspicious of this approach from the first and as he gathered information he only became more negative, fearful of provoking further government repression, especially if he was correct in believing that the associations sheltered advocates of violent revolution. Before he could report fully to his superiors in Rome, he ran afoul of a different government restriction. For decades, Mexico had banned religious rites in public. In January 1923, when he had been in Mexico more than a year, Filippi led a group of bishops in blessing the cornerstone of a monument to Christ the King being constructed on a hillside near Silao. The government of President Alvaro Obreg√≥n deemed this a violation of its prohibition on public religious ceremonies and deported Filippi, provoking popular protests. On 31 March 1923, Pope Pius XI named him Apostolic Delegate to Constantinople. On 6 April 1925, Pope Pius appointed him Archbishop of Monreale. On 11 February 1951, Pope Pius XII appointed Francesco Carpino to serve as Archbishop Coadjutor there. He died on 23 August 1951 at the age of 72.

A prewar Bolshevik, Kiryukhin was drafted into the Imperial Russian Army during World War I. He served as a commissar in the 24th Rifle Division during the Russian Civil War and moved to command positions before fighting in the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War. Kiryukhin held a series of command and staff positions during the interwar period, rising to division and corps command in the late 1930s. After Operation Barbarossa began, he took command of the new 324th Rifle Division and led it in the Battle of Moscow.

From October he served as commissar of the 1st Simbirsk Rifle Regiment, which was redesignated as the 214th Rifle Regiment a month later while the division became the 24th Rifle Division. With the division, Kiryukhin fought in battles against the White troops of Alexander Kolchak in Siberia from Simbirsk to Aktyubinsk. Kiryukhin briefly became assistant commissar of the 72nd Brigade of the division in December 1919 before returning to the 214th Rifle Regiment a month later to command a company and then a battalion. He was transferred west with the division for the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, during which the 24th advanced on Mozyr and later Lutsk. During the war and after its end the division also engaged in fighting against the Ukrainian People's Army and the army of Stanis≈Çaw Bu≈Çak-Ba≈Çachowicz. Kiryukhin was awarded the Order of the Red Banner in 1921.  Interwar period  After the end of the war, Kiryukhin remained with the 24th Division for several years, commanding a battalion of the 213th Rifle Regiment from July 1921. A year later, he became a company commander in the 71st Rifle Regiment as the Red Army demobilized and the division was reorganized to consist of three regiments. From March 1923 he served successively as an assistant battalion commander and battalion commander in the 70th Rifle Regiment. Kiryukhin began studies at the Frunze Military Academy in August 1924 and graduated from it in July 1927.

Kiryukhin led the division in the Soviet counteroffensive during the Battle of Moscow. His division captured Bogoroditsk during the Tula Offensive on 15 December and fought on the approaches to Sukhinichi, which was not captured until 29 January, during the Kaluga Offensive. The division then fought in battles to eliminate the German bridgehead on the north bank of the Zhizdra. Appointed deputy commander of the 16th Army in early March, Kiryukhin temporarily commanded it from 7 and 8 March after army commander Lieutenant General Konstantin Rokossovsky was wounded during the attacks on Duminichi and Zhizdra.

Geometric diodes differ from all other forms of diodes because they do not rely on a depletion region or a potential barrier to create their diode behavior. Instead of a potential barrier, an asymmetry in the geometry of the material (that is on the order of the mean free path of the charge carrier) creates an asymmetry in forward vs reverse bias current (aka a diode).  Creating a Geometric Diode  Simple geometric diodes schematic showing generic blue particles (these could be electrons or holes). From left to right the particles are funneled through the diode, but from right to left they are blocked. Geometric diodes are formed from one continuous material (adding a caveat for 2D-electron gasses which are layered systems) that has an asymmetry in the structure on the order of the size of the charge carrier's mean free path (MFP). Typical room temperature MFPs range from single digit nanometers for metals up to tens of hundreds of nms for semiconductors, and even >1 micrometer in select systems. This means that to create a geometric diode, one must either use a high MFP material, or have a fabrication process that has nanometer precision in order to create the relevant geometries. Geometric diodes are majority carrier devices that do not need a potential barrier. The diode behavior comes from an asymmetry in the shape of the structure (as shown in the figure). Quite simply geometric diodes can be thought of as funnels or lobster traps for charges; In one direction it is relatively easy for charges to flow, and in the reverse direction it is more difficult. Additionally, it is ideal to have specular reflection of the charge carriers at the surface of the structure; however, this is not as critical as being small enough to be in a ballistic regime. Advantages and Disadvantages of Geometric DiodesAdvantages= Because all other diodes create asymmetry in current flow through some form of a potential barrier, they necessarily have some degree of a turn-on voltage. Geometric diodes could theoretically achieve zero-bias turn-on voltage due to their lack of potential barrier. With zero-bias turn-on voltage, there is no DC bias that must be supplied to the device; therefor, geometric diodes could greatly reduce the power needed for to operate a device. This could also be beneficial in that the diodes would be more sensitive to small signals. This is of course theoretical, and truly zero-bias diodes may be limited from being experimentally realized. A second major advantage also stems from their lack of potential barrier and minority carriers. A potential barrier is a large source of capacitance in a diode. Capacitance serves to decrease a diodes frequency response by increasing its RC time. Geometric diodes lack of potential barrier means they can have ultra- low capacitance down to the attofarads. A geometric diode's frequency response is limited not by RC time or minority carrier mobility, but by the flight time of the charge carriers through the structural asymmetry. Therefore, geometric diodes can achieve frequency response into the THz. The ability for a geometric diode's electronic properties to be tuned by the geometry of the structure, the surface coating on the structure, and the properties of the material used offer a level customization that is unrealized in any other diode system. Principles learned from geometric diodes and ballistic systems will be used in understanding technology as devices become increasingly on small and exist at or below charge carrier MFPs. =Disadvantages= The same benefits from the lack of potential barrier also come with their share of downsides. The main one being that the reverse bias current from a geometric diode can be quite high (anywhere from three to less than one orders of magnitude less than the forward bias current). Depending on the application, a high reverse bias can be tolerated though. Typically geometric diodes are on the nano-scale, so that necessarily means that have high resistances. However, depending on the fabrication process this can be mitigated by stringing many diodes in parallel. Perhaps the largest hurdle for geometric diodes to overcome is the reliability of their fabrication and ability to scale it up. Geometric diodes are typically made using nanofabrication methods that do not scale up well, but with the increasing resolution of photolithography this may not be a problem for long.  Experimental Examples  Geometric diodes are linked to the phenomena of electron ratchets, and their histories are intermingled. =2DEG= Early work on geometric diodes used 2D electron gasses (2DEG) at cryogenic temperatures because these material systems have a very long charge carrier MFP. One of the most studied structures is a four- terminal geometry that either had a single antidot at the center, or an array of antidots that forces charges down instead of up when current is supplied from either the left or right. This system was initially demonstrated at cryogenic temperatures, but then was able to operate at room-temperature and rectify signals of 50 GHz. =Graphene= The four-terminal geometries have also been created in graphene and function at room-temperature. Additionally, a different, two-terminal geometry resembling the simple geometric diode schematic was demonstrated in 2013. This work showed rectification speeds at THz speeds. =Nanowires= Geometric diodes formed from etched Silicon nanowires were shown to operate at room-temperature in April 2020. This work highlights the tunability of geometric diodes by thoroughly studying the effects of geometry on the diode's electronic properties. The work also demonstrated rectification up to an instrument-limited 40 GHz.

SCAN originated in March 2020 as a partnership between the Public Health department of Seattle and King County in Washington, USA and the Seattle Flu Study. SCAN's predecessor, the Seattle Flu Study, reported the first known case of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States.  Origin and ties to the Seattle Flu Study  The greater Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network originated from the Seattle Flu Study, a public health surveillance program established in 2018. The Seattle Flu Study tracked the spread of bacterial and viral respiratory infections, including influenza, in the greater Seattle area by collecting nasal swabs from volunteers in the community. The public arm of the program allowed people to enroll online and request an at-home nasal swab sample collection kit, to be mailed back to the study team. Additional tests were performed at various locations throughout the community, including public transportation hubs, malls, hospitals and schools. During the 2018-2019 Flu season (October-May), the study collected 3,653 community samples, and 11,273 hospital samples. From January 1st through March 9th, 2020, 3,524 samples were collected through online enrollment. Following the first confirmed case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the COVID-19 outbreak in Washington state, the Seattle Flu Study team decided to test all received samples for SARS-CoV-2. A nasal swab collected by the Seattle Flu Study on February 24, 2020 became the first documented case of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States.  Regulatory challenges  SCAN's predecessor, the Seattle Flu Study, faced significant delays in acquiring federal regulatory approval to test samples for SARS-CoV-2, and made the decision to proceed with testing in the interest of public health. As of May 13, 2020, SCAN was required to halt testing by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) until receiving additional approval from the agency. SCAN responded by noting that they initiated the process to gain FDA approval on March 23, 2020, and have submitted all requested data.  Members and funding  SCAN began as a partnership between the Seattle Flu Study and Public Health - Seattle and King County. It is affiliated with the Brotman Baty Institute, a collaboration between the University of Washington School of Medicine, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and Seattle Children's. It has received technical support from the Institute for Disease Modeling, Amazon Care, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Lindsay Parkinson by Ernest Townsend, 1918 Sir Albert Lindsay Parkinson (24 February 1870 ‚Äî 3 February 1936 ), often known as Lindsay Parkinson, was a British businessman and Conservative Party politician. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Blackpool in Lancashire from 1918 until 1922. Biography Parkinson was born in Lytham to Jacob Parkinson, a joiner. The family moved to Blackpool in 1873. He left school at fourteen to join his father's business, Jacob Parkinson & Co., which later expanded into the building trade. On the death of Jacob in 1902, the business became a limited company, with Lindsay Parkinson as managing director. Parkinson served on Blackpool Town Council from 1905 to 1919, and served as Mayor of Blackpool from 1916 to 1919. At the 1918 election, he was selected as the Coalition Conservative candidate for the seat of Blackpool. He did not contest the seat in 1922, when it was held for the Conservatives by Leonard Molloy. Parkinson was appointed Knight Bachelor in the 1922 King's Birthday Honours. He was knighted by King George V at Buckingham Palace on 8 July 1922. On being knighted, Parkinson changed the name of his company to Sir Lindsay Parkinson & Co. Ltd. On 13 July 1937, it was incorporated as a public company, technically known as Sir Lindsay Parkinson Holdings Limited. Parkinson remained involved in politics, serving as chairman of the Blackpool Conservative and Unionist Association in 1924. He received the Freedom of the Borough of Blackpool in 1926. A keen sportsman, Parkinson gave the cricket ground at Stanley Park to Blackpool Cricket Club. He arranged his own cricket eleven, which played two first-class matches, one in 1933 against the touring West Indians, and one in 1935 against Leicestershire, both at Stanley Park.

The Act sets the goals to reduce emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 and then to 85% below 1990 levels by 2050. The remaining 15% of emissions will be offset, such as by planting trees which take carbon dioxide out of the air, to reach net zero emissions.  Specific Emission Targets by Sector  One of the main hurdles to reaching this goal is dramatically transferring the source of energy within New York State. By 2030, New York aims to get 70% its electricity from renewable sources and by 2040 the goal is to have all the state's electricity come from carbon-free sources like wind and solar energy. Some New York utility providers claim this goal is too ambitious and will result in higher bills for New York residents. Already about 60% of electricity within New York State is being produced by carbon free sources, mainly hydroelectric dams and nuclear power plants. Other sectors will also need to adapt to achieve these emissions reductions targets. Transportation makes up one third of the state's emissions, but national emissions reductions standards are being rolled back to allow for more pollution and stricter state standards for reducing transportation emissions are being challenged by the Trump administration. Additionally, many residential and commercial buildings use natural gas or oil to heat their homes. To reach reduction targets, New York will likely need to invest in the innovation and implementation of new heating systems powered by renewable energy sources. These measures build upon an earlier law (Local Law 97 of 2019) to reduce emissions in existing large buildings in New York City.  Climate Justice Provisions  The plan includes certain stipulations to direct no less than 35% of the program's benefits to historically disadvantaged communities based on a number of determinants related to \\"public health, environmental hazards, and socioeconomic factors\\" and decided by the newly created Climate Justice Working Group. Additionally, the Act also aims to create a \\"community air monitoring program\\" to monitor air quality standards and pollutant levels on a community level, address air quality problems as they arise in communities affected by local air pollution, and take special care to ensure criteria pollutants are eliminated in disadvantaged communities first.  Climate Action Council  The Act created a 22-member Climate Action Council to publish actionable proposals to reduce emissions to target levels within the timespan allowed. The Climate Action Council will publish their preliminary plans within two years of the CLCPA becoming law and then update their plan every five years thereafter. Every economic sector including the transportation, building, industrial, commercial, and agricultural sectors should have a customized plan with a number of strategies for reducing their sector-specific emissions.  Environmental Activism to get the CLCPA Passed into Law  The Act is a product of years of advocacy work by New York environmentally focused community organizations to gain political support for the bill among the New York State Congress. The Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act is a version of a previous bill, the Climate and Community Protection Act. New York Renews, a coalition of over 200 \\"environmental, justice, faith, labor, and community groups, is cited as being instrumental in the bill's passing and was \\"the force behind the nation's most progressive climate law [the CLCPA]\\". New York Renews is now pushing for further progressive legislation to protect vulnerable communities with a Just Transition bill funded by a polluter penalty.

From 1989 to 2007 he held the office of chairman of the German physician's union Marburger Bund, and was named honorary chairman in 2007. In the same year, he was appointed vice president of the German Medical Association. He was the latter's president from 2011 to 2019. In 2015, Montgomery was elected vice chairman of the World Medical Association. In July 2017, he became chairman of the board of directors of Deutsche Apotheker- und √Ñrztebank which is a bank specialised on physicians and chemists in Germany as customers. The assembly of the World Medical Association on 25 April 2019 at Santiago de Chile elected him as chairman of the board for two years. He is also president of the Standing Committee of European Doctors since 2019.  Career  Montgomery was born in Hamburg to a British father who came to Germany during World War Two as a military officer, and a German mother who was a physician. He lives in Hamburg and is married to a physician with whom he has two children. After studying medicine in Hamburg and Sydney, he became an approved medical doctor in Germany in 1979. He became a specialist for radiology in 1986. He was chairman of the Hamburg chapter of Marburger Bund from 1983 to 2016. Moreover, he is member of the board of Deutsche √Ñrzteversicherung (German physicians' insurance) and was chairman of the German Medical Association from 1987 to 2002. From 1994 to 2002 and again from 2002 to 2018 he was president of the Hamburg Chamber of Physicians. As president of the German Medical Association, he held one of two co-chairs of the German Agency for Quality in Medicine. Until the end of 2018, Montgomery worked as an attending physician at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. In 2012, the senate of the city of Hamburg awarded the honorary degree of 'Professor' to Montgomery. This was done in recognition of his engagement in social and health politics, science and medical ethics. In 2013, he was honored with the Dr.-G√ºnther-Buch-Prize for medicine by the 'Johanna-und-Fritz-Buch-Ged√§chtnis-Stiftung'. The Jewish Community of D√ºsseldorf awarded a medal to Montgomery in 2019 for his work on clarifying the role of the German Medical Association during the Nazi era, and for establishing ties to the Israel Medical Association.  Ethical positions  In 2001, Montgomery backed the banning of preimplantation genetic diagnosis in Germany. One year later, he spoke out against the practice of forced application of emetics to secure criminal evidence, but recommended applying laxatives instead. He also advocates a mandatory vaccination against measles. In May 2020, he recommended a mandatory vaccination against the COVID-19 virus should there ever be a suitable vaccine.  Criticism  When he was vice president of the German Medical Association, Montgomery was criticised over his statements in a bribery scandal. Some 3,000 physicians had received gifts or money for prescribing Ratiopharm medical products, and an investigation had been launched in the city of Ulm because of multiple suspicions of fraud and breach of trust. Montgomery called the business practices of physicians who had prescribed Ratiopharm products a \\"totally normal and natural behaviour\\", which could not be considered punishable. While the Ulm prosecutor found that the first two physicians involved in the issue had been bribed by Ratiopharm with a total amount of EUR 19,180, the investigation was closed in 2013 due to a lack of criminally relevant cases. In 2012, the Federal Court of Justice of Germany ruled that physicians with a licence to bill the public health insurances in Germany cannot be prosecuted for bribery. Montgomery commented that the court had chosen the right path, but then also stated that no physician in Germany was allowed to accept gifts from pharmaceutical companies. According to article 34 of the professional responsibility code of German physicians, it is prohibited to ask for or accept compensations for prescribing medicine. In January 2013, he rejected political demands of turning the bribing of physicians into a criminal offence. \\"We reject a legal solution when it is a lex specialis made against physicians. We would, however, not oppose a law that is valid for all freelancers, i.e. also for architects, lawyers and journalists.\\" Instead he demanded more investigative competencies be given to the medical associations and an \\"improvement in the framework for penalties\\" regarding matters of professional responsibility. During the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020, Montgomery was accused of unsettling the public and not living up to his responsibilities. He had called the wearing of scarves or cloths to cover mouth and nose \\"ridiculous\\". Virologist Alexander Kekul√© described Montgomery's theses on facial covers as incomprehensible and \\"blatant nonsense\\". Montgomery was blamed for acting dangerously by creating doubts about the mandatory wearing of facial covers in Germany during the pandemic. His criticism of the government's failure to acquire stocks of high-quality facial masks in time was appreciated though.

He took part in the Battle of Ushant on 27 July 1778, earning Orvilliers' commendation. In 1779, he transferred to 74-gun Citoyen, lead ship in the White-and-Blue squadron of Orvilliers' fleet. He kept her in 1780 under Guichen, and captained her at the Battle of Martinique on 17 April 1780. In 1782, Nieuil commanded the 74-gun Robuste. He captained her at the Battle of Cape Spartel on 20 October 1782. In 1784, Nieuil was promoted to Chef d'Escadre. In 1787, Nieuil directed the Escadre d'√©volution for a training cruise, with his flag on the 74-gun Superbe. He departed Brest in June and reached Lisbon before returning in August. The year after, Nieuil was cruising with a squadron off Tunis, with his flag on Illustre. In 1788, he was made a Knight in the Order of Saint Louis. He commanded a division at Toulon in 1790. He rose to Contre-amiral in 1792.

It was then in use until 1963.  Models  Eduard Stiefel and his two senior assistants Heinz Rutishauser and Ambros Speiser were inspired by models in the USA and United Kingdom when developing the ERMETH. In 1949 Rutishauser and Speiser undertook study trips to Howard Aiken (Harvard University), John von Neumann (Princeton University) and to the University of Cambridge, which operated the EDSAC. In 1950, Stiefel rented for five years the only existing digital computer in continental Europe at that time, the Zuse Z4, completed by Konrad Zuse in 1945, for the ETH in order to gain experience with a calculating machine during the construction of the ERMETH.  Technical concept  The ERMETH had (in contrast to the Z4) a classical Von-Neumann-Architecture, i.e. it was a calculating machine in which program and processed data were stored in the same main memory; thus, numbers, as well as program parts, could be processed automatically. The ERMETH was designed for numerical calculations and worked in true decimal (not dual or hexadecimal) and had instructions for all four basic arithmetic operations with floating-point and fixed-point numbers, but not for processing letters. At the start of operation (1956), it consisted of devices (hardware) and stored user programs (software), but had no operating system, so that each user had to first read in his program, which had already been prepared on punch cards in machine language and then start it by setting the program counter to the first command. Under program control, user data was then read in (from punch cards) and parameter values were requested (via the keyboard) from the user. Already in 1952, Heinz Rutishauser had presented the concept of the compiler for the use of machine-independent computer languages in his habilitation thesis on \\"automatic computation plan production\\". Thanks to the development of the higher programming language Algol (Algol 58 and Algol 60), machine-independent programming later became possible; for the input of letters, the ERMETH 1958 had to be supplemented with a paper tape reader. The ERMETH had an arithmetic unit with 1,500 electron tubes. A 1.5-ton magnetic drum with space for 10,000 words to 16 decimal places (14 digits, sign, check digit), which rotated at 100 revolutions per second, served as the main memory. This also determined the operating speed of the ERMETH per command step, because the average access time to the commands and numbers stored on the drum was 5 milliseconds; the much higher operating speed of the electron tubes did not change this. The use of the 10'000 words of the working memory was very flexible. For each word (with 16 decimal places), either a floating-point number (11 valid digits, 3-digit exponent, sign and check digit), a fixed point number (14 digits, sign, check digit) or two instructions (2 digits for instruction type, 1 digit for index register, 4 digits for memory address) could be stored. An example: The compiler developed by Hans Rudolf Schwarz for Algol 60 programs occupied 4,000 memory cells with double instructions so that 6,000 cells remained available for an application program and its user data. If this was not enough, all 10,000 cells could be used, but only after overwriting the compiler. In this case, however, the compiler had to be reloaded before the next Algol program from punch cards, which alone took almost an hour. For numerical data input, mainly punch cards of the type Remington-edge with 90 columns were used, later on also 5-channel punch tape for Algol program input. Data output was either on punched cards or on an IBM-typewriter, which, however, also output only digits. Thus, punched cards could also be used for intermediate storage of large amounts of data as secondary storage. The electrical power consumption of the ERMETH was 30 kW. It reacted sensitively to fluctuations in the mains voltage, for example when the tram went into operation in the morning. With various technical, financial and personnel setbacks, the ERMETH was built up as a one-off unit from 1955 onwards and gradually put into operation from 1956 onwards; it performed its task until October 1963, when it was dismantled and packed. A planned licensed version of ERMETH by a private company did not come about. After spatial alterations a CDC 1604A of Control Data Corporation took its place from April 1964. The available computing power at ETH increased by a factor of 100 with the transition from the electromechanical Z4 to the ERMETH, but by a factor of 400 with the transition from the ERMETH with its time-critical magnetic drum memory to the fully electronic CDC 1604A.  Deployment  The ERMETH has been used in research and development for very different tasks. The employees of the Institute of Applied Mathematics used it for their own scientific topics to develop numerical algorithms and working aids in the sense of first operating system components. But they were also active as consultants and helpers for computing work of other ERMETH users. They came from the ETH and other universities as well as from industry and from civil and military federal agencies. The ERMETH was also used in teaching. Optional programming lectures were held from the 1950s onwards, and there were also exercises (in groups) on the computer system. If students had written a program and transferred it to punched cards, they could hand in their punched card package and, depending on the program quality, received the expected or a wrong result or even a program abort printed out the next day.  ERMETH today  After its dismantling in 1963, the ERMETH was stored for the time being as an important exhibit for the planned Technorama in Winterthur and then exhibited there from 1982-2004. Since the end of 2006, it has been on permanent loan from ETH Zurich to the Museum of Communication in Bern.  External links  * ERMETH - Elektronische Rechenmaschine der ETH. * ETH Z√ºrich.

Baibek served as the akim of Almaty from 2015 to 2019.  Early life and education  Baibek was born in the city of Alma-Ata (present-day Almaty) in 1974. After graduating from the Kulyash Bayseitova Musical School in Almaty with honors in piano, he entered the Kurmangazy Conservatory in 1992. From 1994 to 1998, he studied in Germany under the Bolashak Scholarship. In 1995, Baibek earned a degree in German Language from the Goethe-Institut‚Äôs annual program in Bremen. He then graduated from the L√ºbeck Academy of Music with a specialty as a teacher in 1998. In 2002, Baibek graduated in absentee from the University of Central Asia in Almaty with a degree in international economics. In 2010, he defended his thesis on \\"The institutionalization of the state protocol of the Republic of Kazakhstan\\", earning doctoral degree in political science.  Early career  From 1999 to 2002, Baibek worked as a referent, attache of the Consulate General of Kazakhstan in Frankfurt and the 3rd secretary of economic missions of Kazakhstan in Germany in the city of Berlin. From 2002 to 2003, he served as an expert in the Central Systems Research of the Presidential Administration of Kazakhstan. From 2004 to 2006, Baibek was the chief inspector of the Protocol of the President of Kazakhstan. In 2006, he became the chief of the Protocol of the President and worked in this position until August 2009, when he became the Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration.  First Deputy Chairman of Nur Otan (2013‚Äì2015, 2019‚Äìpresent)  Baibek in Shymkent, August 2019 On 17 January 2013, Baibek was appointed as the First Deputy Chairman of Nur Otan. In 2014, under Baibek, an anti-corruption program of the Nur Otan was developed and adopted for 2015 to 2025. In March 2015, the party initiated a number of projects dedicated to the 70th anniversary of Victory Day. In the framework of the project ‚Äú–ê—Ä–¥–∞–≥–µ—Ä–ª–µ—Ä–¥—ñ –∞—Ä–¥–∞“õ—Ç–∞–π—ã“õ‚Äù (‚ÄúTaking Care of the Older Generation‚Äù), a complete data was restored on 531 Heroes of the Soviet Union and more than 124 full cavaliers of the Order of Glory. With the assistance of the Nur Otan, the cycle ‚Äú“ö–∞–∑–∞“õ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–¥—ã“õ “õ–∞“ª–∞—Ä–º–∞–Ω–¥–∞—Ä‚Äù (‚ÄúHeroic annals of Kazakhstanis‚Äù) started. A 100 videos in Kazakh and Russian languages about the Kazakh heroes of the war were shown on the Astana channel. On 28 June 2019, Baibek was reappointed again as the First Deputy Chairman.  Mayor of Almaty (2015‚Äì2019)  Transportation = Tram closure  On 31 October 2015, tram traffic was closed in Almaty due to the results of the inspection, which revealed numerous irregularities and inconsistencies: there were gaps of up to 50 mm at all assembly joints, rail wear was up to 2‚Äì2.5 cm, wooden sleepers were rotten. Due to the condition of the tram tracks, wheel sets of wagons were heavily worn out. In 2014, there were 20 facts of the derailment of cars. Up until September 2015, there were 43 derailments. In 2017, the dismantling of tram tracks began.  Onai System  On 11 January 2016, the public transport system \\"Onai\\" was introduced, which was non-cash fare system. The system deduced unaccounted cash from the shadow turnover. In September 2016, the cash payment of Almaty residents for a month amounted to 256 million tenge, with cards to only 0.8 billion tenge. In September 2017, the monthly cash income was 91 million tenge, and through the Onai card, 1.5 billion tenge. 800 million tenge were withdrawn from the shadow turnover in one month.  Upgrades  Under the leadership of Baibek, public transport was updated by 80%, almost 1300 new buses were purchased. In January 2016, 70% of the state- owned company ‚ÄúAlmatyelektrotrans‚Äù was transferred to a private investor Green Bus Company LLP for 5 years in trust without the right to subsequent redemption.  Bus rapid transit  In September 2018, the first BRT line in the country was launched on Timiryazev Street, at peak hours, the speed of buses along the line was 3 times higher than cars. Already in the first 10 days of operation, passenger flow increased by 40% from 100,000 to 140,000 people. = Speed limit = After speed reduction on Al-Farabi Avenue from 80 to 60 km, the number of accidents decreased by 2.7 times. On the one-sided Kurmangazy street, the number of accidents decreased by 41%, and on Shevchenko street was 4 times. = Urban policies = For several years, work was underway to reconstruct the central streets of the city for pedestrians. One of the main objects of change was Panfilov Street, which became a pedestrian street from Zhibek Zholy Street to Qabanbai Batyr Street. Under Baibek, more than 600 streets and almost 1,600 courtyards of Almaty were repaired, where modern children's and sports grounds, surveillance cameras, and courtyard lighting appeared. 30% of street lighting was converted to energy-saving LED lighting. 300 km of irrigation ditches and 2000 km of engineering networks were also repaired and built. Almost 3000 illegal kiosks were demolished in the city. Baubek announced the City Without Fences program, in which 150 km of fences were dismantled. Many organizations planted bushes and trees as a replacement. In October 2015, the building of the former General Plan on Jeltoqsan Street was demolished. Members of the Defend Almaty initiative group gathered near the building, claiming that work was being carried out illegally, but the city planning council issued all the necessary permits. In October 2015, with the approval of the Town Planning Council, the Alatau Cinema building, built in 1960, was demolished for the construction of McDonald's. Social media users organized a flash mob against the demolition of the building. In response to the controversies, Baibek stated that for 20 years the cinema was empty, and it did not represent historical value, since it was made of alucobond. A project for preventive monitoring of mudflow hazard was developed. Seismic amplification of 65% of educational facilities and 53% of healthcare was carried out. To protect against mudflows, the Mynjylky Dam was reconstructed, 9 of the most breakthrough moraine lakes were emptied. 9 rivers canals were reconstructed. Protective structures strengthened the slopes at HES-1 - BAO and Medeu - Shymbulak. For the first time in the city, the ‚ÄúParticipation Budget‚Äù project was implemented where a part of the city budget is distributed by the citizens themselves. = Social objects = In a few years, 11 schools and more than 540 public and private kindergartens were opened, and 12 hospitals and clinics were commissioned. Within the framework of the project ‚ÄúBaityt Obybasy‚Äù, the payment for kindergartens was halved, and a large number of private kindergartens were opened. As a result of this work, more than 20 thousand children were enrolled in kindergartens. From 2015, Almaty schools, colleges, hospitals and KSK began to publish their reports on financial activities. In February 2019, a simplified mortgage lending program was launched for large families. While Baibek was akim, many medical centers were sold into private ownership. The privatization plan of these and other facilities in the country was previously approved by the Decree of the Government of Kazakhstan from 30 December 2015 No. 1141 ‚ÄúOn some issues of privatization for 2016-2020‚Äù. = Criticism = In May 2017, environmental activists of the ‚ÄúDefend Almaty‚Äù and ‚ÄúDefend Kokkailau‚Äù groups gave the Akim a gift-installation ‚ÄúDeath of Almaty‚Äù, which, according to the authors of the present, symbolizes the concern of the townspeople about the activities of the city akim. That same month, the appeal of a public figure Denis Krivosheev to Baibek was published.

Mitchell graduated from the all-black Howard High School school of nursing training at Provident Hospital in 1944. Mitchell wanted to come back to Delaware to work, but couldn't find employment. She was told by hospitals in the state that they did not hire African-American nurses. Instead, she worked at a Jewish hospital in Philadelphia. In 1949, Dr. Mesrop A. Tarumianz who was looking for nurses with a background in psychology, hired Mitchell to come work for him at the Governor Bacon Health Center. Mitchell was the first African-American nurse to work in a Delaware hospital. She was also the first black nurse to work with patients of all races in a state hospital. After working at Bacon Health Center, she was transferred to the Delaware State Psychiatric Hospital in 1963. Mitchell earned her bachelors degree from the University of Delaware in 1963 and eventually received a masters degree from Washington College. In 1969, she was appointed as director of nursing for the hospital. Mitchell retired from the Psychiatric Hospital in 1979.

According to Azorean chronicler Gaspar Frutuoso, the earliest settlers to the area thought the largest of the islets looked like a church or monastery, and therefore named the islets and their settlement Mosteiros. Frutuoso noted: :\\"Between the large islet and Ponta Ruiva, by the cliffs, until the promontory of Escalvados, there are some large depressions and well made fumaroles, in the form of a church, or monasteries, or of both things, that older settlers called the monasteries [Mosteiros], situated on the faj√£ that ran from the peak in Sete Cidades.\\" Geography The Mosteiros Islets are the exposed remains of a submarine volcanic cone heavily eroded by the sea over time.

He eventually completed his studies in economics at the University of Heidelberg in 1929, then obtained his doctorate in political science in 1931. = Nazi associations = In 1932, he published his first book Zwischeneuropa und die deutsche Zukunft (\\"Inter-Europe and the German future\\"), followed by Deutschland in der Weltpolitik (\\"Germany in World Politics\\") in 1933. He continued to write for Die Tat in association with other right-wing figures such as Hans Zehrer, Ferdinand Zimmermann, and Ernst Wilhelm Eschmann. He was made editor of Die Tat in 1933. In October 1933, at the suggestion of Heinrich Himmler, he was appointed Head of Policy at the M√ºnchner Neueste Nachrichten (\\"Munich's Latest News\\"). Also in 1934, Wirsing became an Anw√§rter, or candidate, for the Schutzstaffel (SS), and began working as an informant for the Nazi intelligence agency Sicherheitsdienst (SD). On November 1, 1938, Wirsing was promoted to the rank of Hauptsturmf√ºhrer of the SS (equivalent to captain), and was made chief editor of the M√ºnchner Neuesten Nachrichten in addition to his continuing work as editor of Die Tat (which began publishing as Das XX in 1939). He travelled to the United States in 1938. He also worked as a consultant for the cultural policy department of the Federal Foreign Office, for which he wrote anti-Bolshevik language regulations until the end of World War 2. = Nazi party involvement and propaganda = Wirsing formally joined the Nazi Party in 1940. Wirsing gave a lecture at the Frankfurt opening of the Alfred Rosenberg-led Institute for Study of the Jewish Question on March 27, 1941.Printed in: Welt-Kampf. Organ des Instituts, Hoheneichen- Verlag, Nr. 1‚Äì2, April‚ÄìSeptember 1941, S. 22‚Äì29. He published his view of the government and culture of the United States in his 1942 book Der ma√ülose Kontinent (The Excessive Continent). The book contrasted the American system, which he believed was manipulated by Jewish influence, with a proposed \\"new world order\\" in the form of a German-dominated European hegemony.Janich Oliver: Die Vereinigten Staaten von Europa. (books.google.ch). The book was favored by Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, who discussed the book in his diary that year. In 1943 Wirsing became editor of Nazi propaganda magazine Signal, later becoming its editor-in-chief in 1945. Until 1944, Wirsing wrote for the Deutsche Informationsstelle (\\"German Office of Information\\") in Berlin. The Deutsche Informationsstelle was an SS propaganda institute specializing in translations of propaganda into various European languages. He occasionally published under the pen name Vindex, as with the 1944 French- language propaganda booklet Stalinisme: la politique sovietique pendant la deuxieme guerre mondiale (\\"Stalinism: Soviet politics during the Second World War\\"). This booklet argued that Soviet imperialism posed an immediate threat to the nations of Europe.Martens, Ludo. On certain aspects of the struggle against revisionism - For the unity of all communists, in defence of proletarian internationalism \\\\- A Swedish-language edition was also published, titled Stalinismen. Sovjetpolitiken under det andra v√§rldskriget. During the summer of 1944, the German Information Office in Stockholm distributed 7,700 copies of this booklet.Statens Offentliga Utredningar 1946:86. Den tyska propagandan i Sverige under krigs√•ren 1939-1945. Stockholm: Socialdepartementet, 1946. p. 246 = Egmont reports = By September 1944, it had become clear to some Nazi officials that both political and military defeat were impending. General Walter Schellenberg commissioned Wirsing to begin preparing reports considering potential outcomes of such a defeat, based on various sources including SD information provided to Office VI of the Reich Main Security Office. In order to preserve his anonymity and allow for purportedly-accurate reporting, the reports were signed with the name Egmont and became known as the Egmont reports. Between October 1944 and March 1945, twelve or thirteen Egmont reports were written. = Post-war Germany = Wirsing was taken prisoner in June 1945 and soon began to work as a source of information for the United States Secret Service. He undertook a study trip on its behalf through Allied-occupied Germany in 1946, although officially he remained interned. In the internment camp, he advocated making the occupied zone into the forty-ninth American state. He was interrogated by German- American lawyer Robert Kempner in December 1947. In 1948, during the denazification process, Wirsing was classified as a Mitl√§ufer (\\"follower\\"); in other words, a person sufficiently involved with the Nazi party that they could not simply be dismissed as uninvolved, but not so involved as to be charged with any of the war crimes of the Nazi regime. Such persons were typically fined ‚Äì Wirsing was fined 2000 Reichsmarks, which was reduced to 500 on appeal. Later that year, Wirsing co-founded conservative Evangelical Christian weekly , which was an official journal of the Evangelical Church in Germany from 1949, as well as the highest-circulation weekly newspaper in the German Federal Republic until 1963. He became its editor-in-chief in 1954; despite protests from the Social Democratic Party of Germany, including politicians Herbert Wehner and Willy Brandt, he held that position until 1970.Klaus Harpprecht: Im Kanzleramt. Tagebuch der Jahre mit Willy Brandt. Rowohlt, Reinbek 2000, , S. 504 (dort auch das Wort vom Trommelfeuer). In 1967, German magazine Der Spiegel reported that Wirsing had demanded the \\"violent elimination of the Jewish element\\" in the fourth edition of Der ma√ülose Kontinent, printed in 1943, which they argued had contributed to the \\"expediency of Auschwitz\\" and therefore implicating Wirsing in Nazi war crimes. Wirsing threatened Der Spiegel with legal action. On April 16, 1959, Wirsing published an article in Christ und Welt which described a man he felt was \\"a second Albert Schweitzer\\" working in a remote area of Ghana, in West Africa. The man he was describing was actually the Nazi doctor and SS officer Horst Schumann, then a fugitive; he was extradited to Germany in 1966 to be prosecuted for Nazi war crimes.  Personal life  Giselher Wirsing was married twice. His first wife was Ellen R√∂sler, with whom he had two daughters, including journalist . His second wife was publicist Gisela Bonn. Bonn and Wirsing wrote several books together.  Bibliography  As author = * Zwischeneuropa und die deutsche Zukunft. 1932 * Deutschland in der Weltpolitik. 1933 * K√∂pfe der Weltpolitik.

He is the Director of Salt Media, and a church in Makerere, Kikoni, Kampala, the House of Prayer Ministries International (also known as Canaan land). He was named the most influential born-again preacher by the East Africa Book of Records.  Early life and education  Bugingo was born in Masaka and grew up with his maternal grandparents who took care of him after his mother left to live in Rwanda, with his Rwandan father. His uncle prevented him from continuing to a higher level of education, and Bugingo eventually left for Kampala as a teenager as a result of his uncle's abuse. Upon reaching Kampala, Bugingo initially ended up on the streets, but through friends was directed to Ssentongo Godfrey, who offered Bugingo work at his house and a place to stay. He worked as a House Boy at Ssentongo's house for a while, before Ssentongo gave him a job making and selling pop cons at Owino market. He saved enough money to start his own hawking business selling household items and ladies' dressing gowns around Kampala city. He moved to the Kampala suburb of Kazo, renting a small single room. Bugingo has a bachelor's degree in theology, and a certificate in Christian Culture Mentoring, received on 28 June 2019 from Kayiwa International University. He was awarded for his contributions to the development of the Pentecostal Church in Uganda, and graduated top in his year.  Pastoral career  On Christmas Eve, 1992, Bugingo found salvation at KPC (present day Watoto church) during a screening of a Christian film, Heaven's Gates and Hell's Flames. Bugingo started serving as a Pastor at Victory Christian Centre Ndeeba. He began participating in a Christian talk radio station based in Ndeeba , Impact FM, by making phone calls to the broadcast. Bugingo started working as a church assistant, organising the church and leading worship. Joseph Sserwadda, the lead Pastor at Victory Christian Centre Ndeeba, was impressed with his work and appointed him Pastor. In addition to his ministry as a pastor, Bugingo took on other roles at Impact FM, including moderating faith programmes such as Manya Kyokiriza. Bugingo worked at Victory Christian Centre and Impact FM until 31 December 2010, when he resigned, against the wishes of Sserwadda. After leaving Joseph Sserwadda, Aloysius Bugingo and his wife Teddy founded House of Prayer Ministry International (HPMI), Their ministry began at Bat Valley Theatre. HPMI launched Salt FM in 2014 and SaltTelevision in 2015. The church congregation and listenership on Salt Radio increased steadily, especially Bugingo's lunchtime prayer services. At one point church members rented out Bat Valley Primary School playground as not everyone could fit in the church. The growing number of HPMI members prompted a search for a bigger piece of land to house the church. Bugingo has been involved in public feuds with many other pastors in Kampala. He sometimes uses his preaching to accuse fellow pastors of robbing their church members, which has led to feuds between Bugingo and other pastors in the city that are still ongoing. He has been accused of trying to tarnish the other pastors' character to attract their followers to his church. Bugingo began teaching about missing Bible verses in the Good News and King James Bibles that refer to the Holy Spirit as 'Holy Ghost'. He asked Christians to stop reading the Bible because it was misleading them. He instead encouraged Christians to read the King James Version, but only after ensuring that every verse is present and the 'Holy Spirit' is not 'Holy Ghost'. In Bugingo's view, a ghost cannot be holy, meaning any Bible referring to the Holy Spirit as Holy Ghost is satanic. In 2017 Bugingo declared a burning of the 'satanic' Bibles. He was later sued in court, but denied the accusation, saying he was not referring to physical fire, but 'spiritual' fire. Bugingo was sued at Nabweru Magistrates Court in 2017 by two Christians, Aloysius Kizza Matovu and Evangelist Francisco Semugooma for burning Bibles. Bugingo won, as the presiding Judge said the accusers failed to produce solid evidence that Bugingo had burnt the Bibles, and the fire they showed of Bibles did not indicate him anywhere. In February 2019, Bugingo's church was sued in the High Court for noise pollution. Bugingo donated Ushs100 million to the Ugandan government to fight against COVID-19.  Personal life  In the early 1990s, Bugingo married Teddy Naluswa, and the couple lived in poverty. Despite clashes over Bugingo's born again faith, they stayed together for their children. Bugingo and Naluswa have three daughters, Doreen Gift, Winnie, and Jenifer Bugingo, and one son, Miracle Bugingo. Bugingo's marriage to Teddy made the national news in Uganda when the couple's conflicts became public. Teddy subsequently stopped attending church, and Bugingo told the church congregation that she and their daughter Doreen were working against his ministry and trying to steal church assets. Bugingo claimed that Teddy had demanded a share of church land in exchange for a divorce. Other religious leaders disapproved of Bugingo's behaviour. In 2019, Bugingo was criticized by fellow preachers and the public for insulting his wife Teddy publicly and disclosing their marriage secrets. Teddy Bugingo launched her own church, Word of Salvation Ministries International (WSMI) in January 2020. In 2020, five pastors were alleged to have left HPMI for Teddy Bugingo's Church. In September 2019 he was quizzed by Minister Nakiwala over child neglect. Bugingo subsequently entered into a relationship with Susan Makula. In December 2019, she announced that she was pregnant with twins.

It is maintained by the Dia Art Foundation, who consider it one of the eleven locations and sites they manage.  History  Max Neuhaus was a contemporary music maker and artist credited with being the first person to use sound as their primary medium in contemporary art. Times Square was one of a grouping of sound art pieces he created throughout the 1970s in public places in New York City. Other works from the same time period include Walkthrough, in what is now Jay Street‚ÄìMetroTech station, and A New Work (Underground) in the Museum of Modern Art's garden. The work to create Times Square specifically began when Neuhaus entered negotiations with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) and Consolidated Edison (ConEd) in 1973 about installing the piece. These negotiations stretched over four years largely due to the MTA's refusal to collaborate with a private individual. Neuhaus had to form a non-profit, which he named \\"Hybrid Energies for Acoustic Resources\\" (HEAR), before the state agency would begin discussions.Max Neuhaus; Times Square, 1977. Dia Art Foundation. Retrieved May 20, 2020. Once the negotiations were completed, Neuhaus constructed homemade electronic sound generators to be used specifically for this piece. He opened the street grate on a pedestrian island between Broadway and Seventh Avenue, between 45th and 46th Streets, and climbed down into a steam escape vent shaft that is visible through the grate. Here he installed both the generator and a loudspeaker. From the beginning, powering the work proved troublesome as the voltage internal to the subway system was too high to power the piece, and ConEd refused to join a line to MTA property. To rectify this, Neuhaus hired an independent maintenance company to connect the piece to a nearby street lamp through an improvised connection. An image of Times Square in 1977, the year Times Square was first installed From 1977 through the early 1990s, Times Square continued to play, but supplying power was an ongoing problem. Neuhaus began getting more commissions in Europe and moved abroad, so keeping up with the maintenance on the piece became impossible. For this reason, the piece was disconnected in 1992, but Neuhaus's reputation continued to grow. In 2002, Christine Burgin, a New York City gallery owner, conceived of bringing Times Square back. By working with Neuhaus, the MTA, the Times Square Business Improvement District, and the Dia Art Foundation, Burgin managed to relaunch the piece. The main difference in the new incarnations of the work is a higher volume to overcome the increase in noise in Times Square. Subsequently Neuhaus donated Times Square to the Dia Art Foundation, who currently maintain the piece. Between the 2002 relaunch and Neuhaus's death in 2009, Neuhaus built additional fail- safe measures into the work so that it would not turn off accidentally. He also watched the area over webcam and worked to discourage street performers as he was worried their sounds would interfere with Times Square. For about a year between 2015 and 2016, due to the multi-year pedestrianization of Times Square construction, Times Square was inaccessible but, according to the director of communications at the Dia Art Foundation, was never turned off. During this construction granite seating was added next to the grate Times Square emanates from. Also in 2016 New York introduced \\"Designated Activity Zones\\" throughout Times Square where street musicians and costumed characters are allowed to perform for tips.New Zones Painted In Times Square To Regulate Costumed Characters.

Design  Times Square is located in Times Square, on the north side of what was once a triangular pedestrian island, but is now a pedestrian plaza, created by the intersection of Broadway and Seventh Avenue, between 45th and 46th Streets. There is no signage or marking to denote the piece as a work of art per Neuhaus's request. The sound simply emanates from a grate over a steam vent. Neuhaus stated it is intended for the sound to be \\"plausible\\", dismissed as an \\"unusual machinery sound from below ground\\" and to be overlooked repeatedly until it is discovered by the viewer in a serendipitous way. The sound itself is described by Neuhaus as \\"resembling the after ring of large bells,\\" but has also been described as a \\"deep and slightly pulsating drone\\" by Dia, \\"a rich harmonic sound texture\\" by the MTA,Times Square-46th Street. MTA Arts & Design. Retrieved May, 19 2020. and \\"a deeply resonant and mildly undulating drone, its tone suggestive of low-pitched chimes or church bells,\\" by The New York Times. While it is a singular wavelength, Dia notes that the perceived sound changes in \\"pitch, timbre, and tone relative to human movement. The surrounding area has changed drastically since the work was first installed in 1977. Neuhaus described the area in 1977 saying, \\"The aural and visual environment is rich and complex. It includes large billboards, moving neon signs, office buildings, hotels, theaters, porno centers and electronic game emporiums. Its population is equally diverse, including tourists, theatregoers, commuters, pimps, shoppers, hucksters and office workers.\\" As of 2020 the area is largely a tourist area populated with \\"desnudas\\" and costumed characters performing for tips.

She was active in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War until September 1863, when she went to Tennessee for several months before returning to the east. After the war, she was active in national reform causes. Early life Elizabeth Harris was probably born in 1831 at St Athan, in the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, in the United Kingdom. Most of early life is not known, including the year when she traveled to the United States of America. She married John Harris who practiced medicine in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Civil War career In April 1861 at the start of the Civil War, Harris helped organize the Ladies' Aid Society of Philadelphia. She became the Society's field correspondent with the task of distributing the supplies gathered by the group. Because of her organizing talent, other ladies' aid societies in Pennsylvania secured her assistance. She became an agent for the United States Christian Commission and the U.S. Sanitary Commission. She accompanied the Union Army and tended to sick and wounded soldiers in the Peninsula campaign in March‚ÄìJuly 1862, after the Second Battle of Bull Run in August 1862, and after the Battle of Antietam in September 1862. She also performed nursing duties aboard a hospital ship after the Battle of Seven Pines in June 1862. Harris was active in the Eastern Theater from the First Battle of Bull Run through the Battle of Gettysburg. She was credited with inventing ginger panada which consisted of cornmeal, mashed army crackers, ginger, wine, and boiling water. This concoction, which was also called bully soup, was fed to soldiers in both eastern and western theaters of the war. Among her many duties, she distributed and cooked food, nursed sick and wounded soldiers, helped with amputations, cleaned up after surgeries, and prayed with the soldiers. She also wrote newspaper articles about her experiences; these helped raise donations for the Sanitary Commission. Despite being warned by the War Department not to go, Harris traveled to Gettysburg after the July 1863 battle. Next, she went with the soldiers to Tennessee where she remained from September 1863 to May 1864. While there, she served in the hospitals in Nashville and Chattanooga. However, she became ill and returned to Washington, D.C.. After she recovered, she nursed soldiers in the Fredericksburg, Virginia hospital. During the war, she visited over 100 hospitals in her capacity as a nurse or as an advocate for improved health care. Late and post-war From late 1864 to early 1865, Harris assisted fugitive slaves and other war refugees from Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. She also cared for the repatriated Union Army prisoners from Andersonville. At war's end, she returned home to Philadelphia where her husband's medical practice was successful. In later years she was involved in nursing and support for local and national reform causes. She died on June 12, 1891 in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania.

It was once at least 6.4 km long but now only 4.4 km is now visible. It is sometimes spelt Comb's Ditch. The earthwork consists of a bank with a ditch on the north east side. Combs Ditch forms the boundary between several parishes in Dorset. The parishes of Charlton Marshall and Spetisbury lie to the north east of Combs Ditch while Winterborne Whitechurch, Winterborne Kingston and Anderson lie to the south west. Combs Ditch is to the north of the Roman road that ran from Badbury Ring to Dorchester but there is no evidence that it intersected the road. The bank ranges from 5.4 m to 8.5 m wide with a maximum height of 2.2 m. The ditch varies in width from 4.8 to 8.5 m. Excavation found third or fourth century Roman pottery lying on the turf line behind the bank probably before its final reconstruction. The limited excavation seems to show an Iron Age boundary ditch being enlarged into a defensive earthwork in the late Roman or post-Roman period.

Identification  Physical = Eggs are approximately - long and white colored. On the larva stage yellowish, - long, with golden hair and black mandibles. During adulthood, they are dark greyish-brown, elongated, - long and covered with silver hair. They also have silver, shiny spots that form two bands crossing the elytra. In addition, males are smaller in size than females. The males‚Äô antennae are longer than their bodies whereas females‚Äô antennae are shorter than their bodies. = Behavioral = Females lay 1-3 eggs after emerging from pupation cells into large branches or bark, and into old larvae galleries. In total females lay approximately 270 eggs in their lifetime. Eggs take 9-17 days to completely develop during summertime, and in late summer, larvae reach - long. During autumn and springtime larvae penetrate into the wood into galleries, which are oriented upward and then downward like a bow. Pupation takes place during late summer and adults emerge during early autumn/summer but do not leave the little galleries chambers until the next spring. In total the life cycle of Aeolesthes sarta takes 2 years.  Distribution  The origin of the Aeolesthes sarta is Pakistan and Western India. They spread to Afghanistan and Iran, and were first found in 1911 in Samarkand, a city in Uzbekistan in Central Asia.‚ÄúAeolesthes Sarta.‚Äù Data Sheets on Quarantine Pests, March 2006. Present distribution includes Afghanistan, India, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Iran, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and former USSR. The invasive insects can be found in mountains with altitudes up to .  Modes of distribution  Aeolesthes sarta may be transported, at many different life stages, in untreated traded wood. Adults can be carried on many different surfaces. They do not attack branches, rootstocks, and trunks. For this reason, it is unlikely that they are transported in plants.  Ecological role  Aeolesthes sarta can attack both healthy and stressed trees. The pests are known to feed on at least fifteen different plant species. Generations of the pests remain on the same tree for many consecutive years before the tree dies. Young trees, that have thin barks, are more susceptible to the pest. A young larva can circle around a tree eating it‚Äôs cambium, or secondary layer, which will cause the tree to die quickly. Aeolesthes sarta has caused damage to several plantations, and as a result there are no large trees in Tashauz, Turkmenistan. Aeolesthes Sarta contributes to the disruption of ecological homeostasis in natural and urban forests located in hot/dry geographical zones where reforestation is difficult.‚ÄúAeolesthes Sarta Arthropod.‚Äù Entity Display : Aeolesthes Sarta, 14 Mar. 2002, ecoport.org/ep?Arthropod=243859&entityType;=AR****&entityDisplayCategory;=full.

Walnut trees in Kashmir Valley have been severely damaged due to Aeolesthes Sarta. Budgam has the greatest impact with 40% of walnut trees damaged. Walnut trees are one of the species more susceptible to be infected with Aeolesthes Sarta, but is also one of the most economically prosperous plant species, due to its tradeable fruit, which can be edible and also use the shells as fuel, and hardwood that is extremely valuable, high quality wood and used to make furniture, decorative items, etc. Walnut trees also serve as an employment opportunity for women. This is, that the more Walnut trees invaded by Aeolesthes Sarta, the more of them will be taken down and the more female unemployment will be.  Management  The countries and regions affected by Aeolesthes sarta are trying to keep the pest under control by cutting and burning all infected trees, replanting plant species that may be more resistant to the pest, and/or treating the new and existing trees with chemicals to prevent Aeolesthes Sarta from spreading. In addition, to contributing biological and microbiological research institutions successfully perform experiments for pest control. Experiments have shown the pesticides imidacloprid and permethran to be effective, when sprayed on elm trees, in killing the pests and preventing the deposit of the beetle eggs into the tree bark.Mazaheri, Afsaneh, et. al. ‚ÄúLaboratory and Field Evaluation of Insecticides for the Control of Aeolesthes Sarta Solsky.‚Äù Journal of Crop.

It was originally serialized by Shueisha in their magazine Weekly Young Jump from December 12, 2013 to May 12, 2016, and has since been collected in eleven tank≈çbon volumes. A light novel spin-off, Boku Girl: Boku no Arbeit, was released in 2015. The story follows Mizuki Suzushiro, who initially is depicted as a young, feminine man. Selected by the bored god Loki as a target for a magical prank, Mizuki wakes up one morning with breasts and a vagina; the transformation becomes a catalyst for self-discovery and for an exploration of Mizuki's sexuality. While adapting to the change, Mizuki is supported by Takeru Ichimonji, a childhood friend, and Yumeko Fujiwara, a classmate who Mizuki has a crush on. The series was well received for its comedy and romance, its art and character design, and its use of transgender themes. It performed well commercially across gender demographics, with many copies bought by women. Its commercial success was in part attributed to its story and art, and in part to the popularity of feminization and homosexuality as themes in manga. Synopsis Boku Girl is a transgender-themed ecchi romantic comedy, and follows Mizuki Suzushiro, who in the beginning of the series is depicted as a male high school student with a feminine beauty, which often causes Mizuki to be read as a woman and get flirted with by men, and an insecurity over a lack of masculinity. One day, the bored Norse trickster god Loki decides to play a prank on humans, and picks Mizuki as her target; the next morning, Mizuki is shocked to wake up with breasts and a vagina. Despite initially being opposed to the transformation, it serves as a catalyst for self-discovery and exploration of sexuality, and for development and confirmation of Mizuki's hidden femininity, while adapting to living as a woman and gradually beginning to like it. =Characters= * is the series' main character, a feminine high school student with an insecurity over a lack of masculinity, whose father always stressed the importance of acting like a man.

Production and release Boku Girl was written and illustrated by Akira Sugito, and was originally serialized by Shueisha in their magazine Weekly Young Jump, from the 2014/2 issue on December 12, 2013 to the 2016/24 issue on May 12, 2016. Shueisha has since collected the series in eleven tank≈çbon volumes, published under the Young Jump Comics imprint. The volumes were also published digitally through Shueisha's mobile app Yanjan. In addition to the original manga, Boku Girl merchandise has been released: A dakimakura pillow featuring Mizuki was produced in 2015, and a Mizuki bish≈çjo figurine in 2016. A light novel spin-off written by Tama and illustrated by Sugito, Boku Girl: Boku no Arbeit, was published by Shueisha on September 18, 2015. A Chinese edition of the manga is published by the Chingwin Publishing Group. alt=The logo shows \\"Boku Girl\\" written in a large font in the Latin alphabet, with \\"Boku\\" in blue and \\"Girl\\" in pink, and written within smaller circles on top in Japanese. The cover artworks for the tank≈çbon volumes were designed and illustrated by Sugito in collaboration with the Weekly Young Jump editorial department, and use pop design along with illustrations of Mizuki. After going through many design iterations and color variations, the series' cover and logo design were changed starting with volume 6. =Volumes=Reception Boku Girl was well received by critics. Honey's Anime liked the series, calling it amusing and saying that its \\"spicy\\" scenarios made it \\"almost impossible to get bored\\" with it. They described it as similar in rhythm and plot development to Akane Ogura's Kanojo ni Naru Hi (2013) and Kanojo ni Naru Hi: Another (2013), recommending fans of either to try the other. They similarly compared it to Tetsuya Hayashi's Mida Love (2016), calling both enjoyable stories about gender not mattering to love. Reviewing Boku Girl up until volume 3, Kono Manga ga Sugoi! praised it for its transgender themes and were excited about it contributing to a wave of transgender manga after series themed around that had long had a hard time finding mainstream success, and hoped that it would become a long-running series. IT Media recommended the series for people who want to try transgender manga, calling it full of charm, with cute portrayals of the protagonist considering the difference between living as a man and as a woman. They praised the series' artwork as cute and appealing, and found both its comedic and romantic elements strong. Boku Girl also performed well commercially, with three volumes debuting on the weekly Japanese top ten manga sales charts. In 2014, Japanese book retailer H≈çrind≈ç Takadanobaba called it one of the more popular manga at the time, with volume 1 selling out on release day; they attributed this in part to the art, story, and cute character design, but also to its theme of feminization, which they described as very popular, with feminization works such as Aya Higuchi's Hatsujo Loop (2014) selling very well. The series was popular among readers regardless of gender, and many tank≈çbon copies were bought by women. In a feature on the topic, Kono Manga ga Sugoi! noted that Boku Girl seemed to also be part of a trend of manga with gay or gay-adjacent themes being popular.

They are maintained or owned by the government of a country, state, province or other territorial entity or by non-profit organizations. They are distinguished from commercial, community, religious and military broadcasters, which are maintained by for-profit organizations, local formal or informal communities, religious organizations, or armed forces, respectively. Typically, the broadcast area of public service broadcasters covers the entire target territory with a network of AM and/or FM transmitters. They may be financed directly by the state or by the citizens who pay licence fee. Their political programs may be balanced that serve the public or they may be propaganda outlets that serve a government. What differentiates these stations from others is that typically each country has only one public service broadcaster (or one for each language group) that offers a group of stations, typically a news/talk, a youth/music and a classical/art music station. In some countries in Latin-America there is no public service radio but there may be public service television. Many countries also maintain international, politically motivated stations that target foreign listeners: those are not listed here.

NIVA manages the website SaveOurStages.com and advocates for federal relief on social media using the hashtag #SaveOurStages.  Formation of NIVA  On March 12, 2020, 75 independent venues and stakeholders joined together for a call organized by Independent Venue Week (IVW), to discuss COVID-19's disruption of the live entertainment industry. The call's purpose was for venues to share their experiences in different stages of the crisis. The call touched on legal ramifications, insurance questions, and governmental regulation. It was also discussed on the call whether independent business owners in the live industry can get access to the SBA loans or tax relief mentioned by Donald Trump in his address to the nation March 11. The call also included Stephen Sternschein, organizer of the ‚ÄúBanding Together‚Äù initiative in the wake of SXSW‚Äôs cancellation, as well as venue owners from the United Kingdom and United States. The National Independent Venue Association (NIVA) was announced soon after to lobby for assistance from the U.S. federal government. Within a matter of days its membership grew to over 450 member venues and a week later it had expanded to 900, including the 9:30 Club in Washington, D.C., Hotel Cafe in Los Angeles, the Red River Cultural District in Austin and the Exit/In in Nashville. At the helm of NIVA is Rev. Moose, Managing Partner of Marauder (the branding and marketing firm who organizes IVW), as well as venue owner Dayna Frank of First Avenue in Minneapolis, and Gary Witt, Executive Director of Pabst Theater Group in Milwaukee. Dayna Frank told Billboard that many of the aid packages and loan assistance available don't work for concert promoters, who will face significant obstacles reopening their businesses. Thanks to funding from See Tickets and Lyte, NIVA hired well known Washington, D.C. lobbying and international law firm Akin Gump in April 2020 to represent the organization's members and advocate for coronavirus-related assistance.  Survey Report: 90% of venues face permanent closure  In May 2020, NIVA published a member survey of its nearly 2,000 member venues and promoters, claiming that 90 percent of independent venues may be forced to permanently close their doors in the next few months, owing to the fiscal strain of ongoing coronavirus lockdown measures. The report emphasized that live entertainment establishments are unable to draw revenue but must still find a way to cover bills, insurance costs, and other expenses. NIVA conducted the survey of its nearly 2,000 member venues and promoters, 90 percent of whom indicated that they will close permanently in a few months without federal funding. NIVA said the current Paycheck Protection Program funding will not solve the crisis. The organization stated that any plan to reopen venues with partial capacity ‚Äúis not economically feasible‚Ä¶payroll, taxes, insurance, and artist pay are not on a sliding scale matching the capacity we‚Äôre permitted to host. They are fixed costs.‚Äù Plus, owing to the national routing of contemporary tours, NIVA signaled that ‚Äúour industry will not recover‚Äù until each state has fully reopened its economy, which is problematic given the differing approaches that governors are taking in directing their reopening initiatives. The report closed by describing the support that some members of Congress have offered the live event industry thus far, as well as possible ways of helping venues to weather the COVID-19 crisis‚Äôs financial fallout. On May 6, 2020, Rolling Stone published an article titled \\"Without Federal Aid, More than 1,000 U.S. Music Venues Are in Danger of Closing\\" and it changed the tide for NIVA, bringing nationwide publicity and calling for immediate action. Dayna Frank told Rolling Stone that \\"90% of its member venues report they do not have cash on hand to last more than six months without federal intervention, and 55% say they do not have enough to last more than three months.\\" Despite never having worked together before, the article explains, its member venues banded together for the first time to seek federal support such as tax relief and business recovery grants.  Artist Letter to Congress  In June 2020, as a response to the growing crisis in the entertainment industry, over 600 major recording artists, including Dave Grohl, Neil Young, Billie Eilish, Lady Gaga, Robert Plant, Willie Nelson and John Mayer, signed a letter to Congress imploring legislators to financially support these institutions. > \\"Dear Congress: We, the undersigned artists, respectfully submit this letter > in support of NIVA‚Äôs request for federal assistance for independent music > venues and promoters across the United States. We will know America is > ‚Äúback‚Äù when our music venues are filled with fans enjoying concerts safely. > The live music experience is inextricably tied to our nation‚Äôs cultural and > economic fabric. In fact, 53% of Americans ‚Äì that‚Äôs 172 million of us ‚Äì > attended a concert last year. We urge you to remember we are the nation that > gave the world jazz, country, rock & roll, bluegrass, hip hop, metal, blues, > and R&B.; Entertainment is America‚Äôs largest economic export, with songs > written and produced by American artists sung in every place on the globe. > All of these genres of music, and the artists behind them, were able to > thrive because they had neighborhood independent venues to play in and hone > their craft, build an audience, and grow into the entertainers that bring > joy to millions. Independent venues give artists their start, often as the > first stage most of us have played on. These venues were the first to close > and will be the last to reopen. With zero revenue and the overwhelming > overhead of rent, mortgage, utilities, taxes and insurance, 90% of > independent venues report that if the shutdown lasts six months and there‚Äôs > no federal assistance, they will never reopen again. We are asking you to > support NIVA‚Äôs request for assistance so these beloved venues can reopen > when it‚Äôs safe and welcome us and our fans back in. The collapse of this > crucial element in the music industry‚Äôs ecosystem would be devastating. > Independent venues are asking for an investment to secure their future, not > a handout. One Chicago report found that every dollar small venues generate > in ticket sales results in $12 of economic activity. If these independent > venues close forever, cities and towns across America will not only lose > their cultural and entertainment hearts, but they will lose the engine that > would otherwise be a driver of economic renewal for all the businesses that > surround them. With respect and solidarity, we, as artists and as community > members ourselves, urge you to pass federal legislation that will help > #SaveOurStages.\\" See the full list of signatories on NIVA's website.  Save Our Stages (SOS) Act  A Forbes article declared in July 2020 that Save Our Stages has finally evolved \\"from hashtag to legislation.\\" A new bill from Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and John Cornyn (R-TX) seeks to provide Small Business Administration grants for independent live music venue operators affected by Covid-19 stay- at-home orders. Introduced July 22, the Save Our Stages Act (SOS Act) would provide six months of financial support to keep theaters and other venues afloat, pay employees and help preserve the ecosystem of restaurants, shops, hotels and other places of business that before March were thriving around indie venues in communities across the country. ‚ÄúThe red light is flashing and we are at the precipice of the collapse of the independent venue industry as we know it. Venue operators are holding on with white knuckles, and feels like the ledge is greased,‚Äù says Audrey Fix Schaefer, Communications Director for NIVA and DC-area venues including the legendary 9:30 Club, the Anthem and Lincoln Theatre. Up to 90% of indie concert venues could shutter in the fall as the shutdown lingers, if no federal funding becomes available, and the venues are forecast to lose almost $9 billion in revenue if the rest of 2020 remains dark. As of mid-June, one in three leisure and entertainment business locations were closed relative to prepandemic levels, and one in three employees in the industry are no longer working. ‚ÄúMinnesota‚Äôs concert halls, theaters and places of entertainment, like First Avenue in Minneapolis, where Prince famously performed, have inspired generations with the best of local music, art, and education,‚Äù Klobuchar said. ‚ÄúThis legislation would help ensure that small entertainment venues can continue to operate, and serve our communities for generations to come.‚Äù ‚ÄúTexas is home to a number of historic and world-class small entertainment venues, many of which remain shuttered after being the first businesses to close,‚Äù said Cornyn. ‚ÄúThe culture around Texas dance halls and live music has shaped generations, and this legislation would give them the resources to reopen their doors and continue educating and inspiring Texans beyond the coronavirus pandemic.‚Äù The Save Our Stages Act is endorsed by NIVA and the National Independent Talent Organization (NITO). The new bill directs the Small Business Administration to make grants to eligible venues equal to the lesser of either 45% of operation costs from calendar year 2019 or $12 million. It would allow the SBA to issue supplemental grants in the future if funding remains available and applicants can demonstrate need, and permits recipients to use grants for costs incurred during the pandemic. The legislation requires recipients to return remaining funding after one year from the date of disbursement. Its introduction follows that in late May of the RESTART Act by Senators Michael Bennet (D-CO) and Todd Young (R-IN), a measure aimed at supporting small- and mid-sized businesses most affected by the Covid-19 crisis.

Biography Mar√≠a Elisa √Ålvarez Obaya was born in Villaviciosa, Asturias on 12 January 1934. She studied pharmacy at the University of Santiago de Compostela and the University of Barcelona, graduating in 1961. After receiving her degree, she moved to Har√≠a, Lanzarote, where she ran a pharmacy. In January 1962 she became the municipal pharmaceutical inspector. Later, she became a researcher in the laboratories of the pharmaceutical inspector of Las Palmas. She worked there until her death on 26 February 2010. Methanol poisoning case In 1963, when she had been Har√≠a's municipal pharmaceutical inspector for one year, √Ålvarez uncovered an infamous poisoning case. After three Lanzarote residents died and two suddenly went blind, she determined that all had recently consumed alcoholic drinks from a particular winery. She ordered all of the company's products seized from local shops and bars. By analyzing the contents of bottles, carafes, and barrels in her pharmacy's small laboratory, she discovered that the patients had been victims of methanol toxicity. She sent samples to the Las Palmas Health Department, which confirmed her findings. Her investigation led to the conviction of an alcohol merchant from Ourense and ten others who had been involved in selling drinks adulterated with dangerous amounts of methyl alcohol, a toxic chemical compound used as antifreeze, solvent, and fuel, across Galicia and the Canary Islands. Despite the rapid action of Mar√≠a Elisa √Ålvarez, it is estimated that more than 50 people died and that dozens lost their vision as a result. Honors In recognition of her work in the \\"Methyl Case\\", √Ålvarez received tributes from the College of Pharmacists of Las Palmas and that of Asturias. In 1965, during the First National Assembly of Pharmacists, held in Lloret de Mar, she received the with a plaque from the General Council of Pharmacists. The same year, the Real Academia Nacional de Farmacia awarded her the ninth , in its Bronze category. In 2016 the Har√≠a City Council dedicated a plaque in her honor.

A provincial from Nemausus, Gaul (modern N√Æmes, France), he gained his military experience as legatus or commander of the Legio III Gallica in the East under Corbulo.

It presents Justice League‚Äîthe fifth film of the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) and based on the DC Comics superhero team of the same name‚Äîas director Zack Snyder had intended it before he left the production and Joss Whedon took over his duties. It features an ensemble cast that includes Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa, Ray Fisher, Jeremy Irons, Diane Lane, Connie Nielsen, and J. K. Simmons. Like the theatrical release, Zack Snyder's Justice League follows the Justice League‚ÄîBatman, Superman, Wonder Woman, the Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg‚Äîas they attempt to save the world from the catastrophic threat of Steppenwolf and his army of Parademons. The theatrical Justice League, released by Warner Bros. in 2017, suffered a difficult production. Its script underwent major changes before and during production between 2016 and 2017. In May 2017, Snyder stepped down during post-production following the death of his daughter, and Whedon took over, completing the film as an uncredited director. Whedon oversaw reshoots and other changes that added a brighter tone and more humor, and cut the runtime down to 120 minutes in accordance with a mandate from Warner Bros. The theatrical Justice League was a box-office bomb and received mixed reviews, leading Warner Bros. to re-evaluate the future of the DCEU and focus development on individual films. As details surfaced about the film's troubled production and its state before Snyder stepped down, many fans expressed interest in an alternate cut more faithful to Snyder's vision. Fans and members of the cast and crew petitioned for the release of this, which they nicknamed the Snyder Cut. At the time, industry insiders regarded the release as unlikely. However, Warner Bros. decided to move ahead with it in February 2020; the following May, Snyder announced that the original cut would be released as Zack Snyder's Justice League via the streaming service HBO Max. The restoration will cost around $70 million to complete the visual effects, score, editing, and additional shooting. Zack Snyder's Justice League is scheduled to be released around early to mid-2021 on HBO Max. It will initially be released as a four-part miniseries, with each episode being an hour long. This will be followed by a version that combines the episodes into a four-hour film.  Premise  Following the death of Superman in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), Batman and Wonder Woman recruit the Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg to form the Justice League and protect the world from Steppenwolf and his army of Parademons, who seek the three Mother Boxes.  Cast  * Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne / Batman * Henry Cavill as Kal-El / Clark Kent / Superman: In 2018, Cavill described Superman as he appears in director Zack Snyder's version of Justice League as completing his character arc that began with Man of Steel (2013) and becoming the \\"true\\" Superman as depicted in the comics. * Gal Gadot as Diana Prince / Wonder Woman * Ezra Miller as Barry Allen / The Flash * Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry / Aquaman * Ray Fisher as Victor Stone / Cyborg: Much of Cyborg's character development was removed in the theatrical release, and Snyder described Cyborg as he is depicted in Zack Snyder's Justice League as \\"the heart of the movie\\". Similarly, Fisher stated that Cyborg's character arc is emotional and allegorical of \\"the journey that Black people have taken in [America]\\". * Amy Adams as Lois Lane * Jeremy Irons as Alfred Pennyworth * Diane Lane as Martha Kent * Connie Nielsen as Hippolyta * J. K. Simmons as James Gordon * Ciar√°n Hinds as Steppenwolf: An alien military officer from the planet Apokolips who leads an army of Parademons and is searching for the three Mother Boxes held on Earth. Hinds had previously described Steppenwolf as \\"old, tired, still trying to get out of his own enslavement to Darkseid\\". Snyder redesigned Steppenwolf for Zack Snyder's Justice League. * Joe Morton as Silas Stone * Amber Heard as Mera * Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor * Kiersey Clemons as Iris West * Willem Dafoe as Nuidis Vulko * Zheng Kai as Ryan Choi * Karen Bryson as Elinore Stone * Julian Lewis Jones as King Atlan * Peter Guinness as DeSaad: Darkseid's master torturer. * Ray Porter as Uxas / Darkseid: A tyrannical New God from Apokolips and Steppenwolf's master. Darkseid did not appear in the theatrical cut, meaning Zack Snyder's Justice League will mark the character's first appearance in a live-action film. Porter played Darkseid through the use of motion capture and \\"went through a few different vocal gymnastics trying to figure out the voice\\". Porter was unfamiliar with the Darkseid character upon being cast, but Snyder and screenwriter Chris Terrio helped guide him with their knowledge of the comic book lore. * Marc McClure as Officer Ben Sadowsky Additionally, Joe Manganiello portrays Slade Wilson / Deathstroke in the post- credits scene.  Differences from the theatrical version  There are many differences between the theatrical Justice League and Zack Snyder's Justice League. While the basic framework of the story is the same, dozens of additional scenes, backstories, mythos, worldbuilding elements, new characters, and teases for upcoming films are present in Snyder's version but not the theatrical release. Zack Snyder's Justice League will not include any scenes shot by Whedon for the theatrical cut. Snyder has also stated that his version of Justice League will be set in a different continuity to Whedon's version. In August 2020, Jason Momoa confirmed that James Wan's Aquaman (2018) took place right after Zack Snyder's Justice League rather than Whedon's version. Due to the initial length of the director's cut, Warner Brothers and Zack Snyder decided to release Zack Snyder's Justice League as a series rather than a full-length film. The series will premiere on HBO Max in early 2021 as a four-part episode series. It will be later reassembled as a one-piece four- hour film after its release.  History  Production of Justice League = Following the release of Man of Steel (2013), director Zack Snyder outlined the basis of the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), which centered around a five-film arc including Man of Steel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), and a Justice League trilogy. Snyder's original vision was to have Batman v Superman be the darkest in the franchise, and have the films become more hopeful in tone from there. However, Batman v Superman was poorly received, with criticism directed at its dark tone, lack of humor, and slow pace. This reaction caused distributor Warner Bros. and Snyder to re-evaluate upcoming DCEU films, particularly Suicide Squad (2016), which had already wrapped principal photography, and Justice League, which was a month away from filming. Snyder and screenwriter Chris Terrio rewrote Justice League to be more hopeful in tone than originally planned. Cinematographer Fabian Wagner said Snyder wanted to \\"get away from the stylized, desaturated, super-high contrast looks of other films in the franchise.\\" Zack Snyder, the director of Justice League Principal photography for Justice League began in April 2016 and wrapped the following December. Months later, multiple cuts of Snyder's Justice League were shown to Warner Bros. executives, in addition to friends and family of Snyder. A final run-time and picture lock were achieved, though the cuts had incomplete visual effects shots and partial audio mixing. Snyder said that he had multiple cuts that were essentially \\"done\\", only needing \\"a few CG tweaks\\" to complete. Forbes contributor and film screenwriter Mark Hughes reported that Snyder's cut was more than 90% complete, while The Daily Telegraph cited a visual effects expert as estimating that Warner Bros. would need another $30‚Äì40 million to finish the film. Warner Bros. executives who saw Snyder's cut felt that Snyder made significant efforts to lighten the tone following the criticism of Batman v Superman. Despite this, Warner Bros. was still unhappy with the results and insider reports indicated that it considered the cut \\"unwatchable\\". After disapproving of Snyder's direction, Warner Bros. hired Joss Whedon, who directed the Marvel Cinematic Universe films The Avengers (2012) and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), to rewrite the script and help with extensive reshoots. Warner Bros. CEO Kevin Tsujihara mandated that Justice League length was not to exceed two hours. Warner Bros. also decided not to push back the release date (which would have allowed the filmmakers more time to properly complete Justice League) so that executives could keep their annual bonuses and partly due to concerns that parent company AT&T; might dissolve the studio after an upcoming merger. Snyder was expected to film the scenes that Whedon re-wrote, and they were working together to meet Warner Bros.'s requests when Snyder's daughter, Autumn Snyder, committed suicide in March 2017. Snyder continued to work on Justice League for two months to distract himself, before stepping down in May. His wife Deborah Snyder, who was producing Justice League, also left the project. Once Snyder left, Whedon assumed full control over the production of Justice League, although Snyder retained directorial credit for the released film. Whedon added nearly 80 new pages to the script, and Wagner estimates that Whedon's cut uses only about 10% of the footage that Snyder shot. Composer Tom Holkenborg completed his film score before being replaced by Danny Elfman halfway through post-production. The scenes that Whedon wrote or re-shot for the theatrical release featured a brighter tone and more humor, and reduced the level of violence seen in Snyder's darker direction. To meet the mandated runtime, more than 90 minutes of Snyder's footage was removed, but the result still adhered to the basic outline of the story. While the initial cut was poorly received by test audiences, the early screening of Whedon's cut scored as high as Wonder Woman (2017), so Warner Bros. decided to move forward with it. Justice League was released theatrically on November 17, 2017. Critics described the theatrical cut as a \\"Frankenstein\\" film, obviously the work of two different directors with competing visions. Justice League grossed $657.9 million against an estimated $300 million budget. Up against an estimated break-even point of as much as $750 million, Deadline Hollywood reported that the film lost Warner Bros. around $60 million. Due to the film's poor performance, Warner Bros. decided to move away from Snyder's vision for a shared universe of interconnected films and focus on standalone films and solo franchises instead. = #ReleaseTheSnyderCut movement = Immediately after the theatrical release of Justice League, which later gained the derisive nickname \\"Josstice League\\", fans created an online petition to release the \\"Snyder Cut\\" that gained more than 180,000 signatures. The movement, which used the hashtag #ReleaseTheSnyderCut on social media, began before fans had any knowledge that a cut of Snyder's Justice League film actually existed in any capacity. The movement was ignited by the mixed reviews of the theatrical cut, as fans knew that Snyder left directorial duties and the final cut of the film in the hands of Whedon; thus, they assumed that Whedon created an inferior film. The circumstances have been compared to the situation of Superman II (1980). Both involved a director who was replaced before completion, which led to a second director coming in and making substantial changes. Richard Donner had been able to complete his Superman II cut in 2006. Some assumed that an alternate cut of Justice League was inevitable because some of Snyder's films have been re-released as extended cuts for home media (such as Watchmen (2009) and Batman v Superman), which some critics see as superior to the theatrical versions. Members of the Justice League cast and crew showing support for the Snyder Cut's release included actors Jason Momoa, Ciar√°n Hinds, and Ray Fisher; photographer Clay Enos; storyboard artist Jay Oliva; cinematographer Wagner; and Ben Affleck's stunt double Richard Cetrone. On the two-year anniversary of the theatrical cut, cast and crew voiced support through social media. Other film- and comic-book-industry figures not related to Justice League have also supported the release of a \\"Snyder Cut\\" including filmmaker Kevin Smith, television producer Steven S. DeKnight, and comic book writers Rob Liefeld, Robert Kirkman, and Jerry Ordway. Other figures were less optimistic. Shawn Robbins, chief analyst for Boxoffice Pro, suggested the size of the movement was too small to make an impact, stating, \\"another cut of Justice League just doesn't seem to be something many outside the die-hard fan base are clamoring to see\\". Industry insiders also called the Snyder Cut's release unlikely. Writer Mario F. Robles, based on his industry connections, said Warner Bros. did not trust Snyder's vision and was not willing to spend millions to finish his cut. Throughout the movement, members of the media referred to the Snyder Cut as \\"fabled\\" or \\"mythical\\". Members of the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut movement engaged in acts of fan activism to promote it. In June 2018, fans reached out to executives at AT&T; following a merger between the company and Warner; in June 2019 they reached out to new Warner Bros. CEO Ann Sarnoff, who replaced Tsujihara after his resignation, following that up a month later with a mass letter-writing campaign; and in July 2019 they reached out to Warner Bros. parent company WarnerMedia after the announcement of its new streaming service HBO Max. Ahead of the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, a fan launched a crowdfunding campaign with half of the funds to be spent on an advertising campaign (including billboards and a flying banner ad promoting the Snyder Cut), and the other half to be donated to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP). For a similar campaign at the 2019 New York Comic Con, the movement purchased ad space on two billboards over Times Square featuring quotes from members of the cast and crew. In December 2019, the movement rented another flying banner ad, this time passing over Warner Bros. Studios and directly asking Sarnoff to release the Snyder Cut. In January 2020, the movement bought four-minutes of ad space advocating for the film's release on a digital banner wrapped around the interior of Riverside Stadium during the FA Cup. As of January 2020, the movement had raised more than $150,000 for the AFSP. Their efforts garnered praise from Snyder and from the AFSP. However, members of the movement have also been described by members of the media as \\"toxic\\" for harassing, threatening, and cyberbullying those who express opinions about the Snyder Cut that are contrary to their beliefs. Yohana Desta of Vanity Fair broadly described the act of fans demanding an alternative cut as a \\"modern pattern of audience demand that is actively making fandoms more toxic\\", and compared it to the 2017 harassment of Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017) actress Kelly Marie Tran. Journalists are subjected to the kind of harassment experienced by Kayleigh Donaldson of Pajiba: through email, website comments and social-media direct messages. In September 2018, former DC Entertainment president Diane Nelson deleted her Twitter account after substantial online harassment by members of the movement. Warner Bros. telephone operators, inundated with regular calls about the \\"Snyder Cut\\", were trained to treat these inquiries as prank calls. Members of the movement tracked down Justice League stuntman Richard Cetrone to ask him questions about the Snyder Cut, only to digitally alter his response and spread on social media a fake text message that appeared to support their cause. Brandon Katz of The New York Observer said that the movement was composed of \\"both toxic DC fans that hurl vitriolic harassment at any and all opposition, and supportive moviegoers that genuinely enjoy Snyder's style and are just hoping to see the conclusion of his trilogy that began with 2013's Man of Steel. As with any contingent, there are both extremists and level-headed individuals in its ranks.\\" Bob Rehak, Swarthmore College Associate Professor and Chair of Film and Media Studies, said that fandoms such as #ReleaseTheSnyderCut revolt when a major change is made to something they love, and that this reaction usually comes from a smaller subsection of the fandom, which \\"[paints] the whole community with a really broad brush.\\" The #ReleaseTheSnyderCut movement inspired several copycat campaigns. In early January 2020, many Star Wars fans organized a #ReleaseTheJJCut fan campaign in response to rumors that J.J. Abrams had to change a lot of his plans for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019) under the directive of The Walt Disney Company. Similarly, after joining Letterboxd in late 2019, Fantastic Four (2015) director Josh Trank met a #ReleaseTheTrankCut fan campaign due to his previous claims that his film was altered in reshoots under the directive of 20th Century Fox, though he has stated that while he appreciated the initiative, it was impossible because much of the sequences he had planned were not filmed. Immediately after news regarding the release of Snyder's cut break, fellow DCEU director David Ayer commented on the changes Warner Bros. imposed on his Suicide Squad film during reshoots, which led to a #ReleaseTheAyerCut fan campaign to see Ayer's original version be released as well. Reports of a longer, darker cut of Batman Forever (1995) have existed since at least as far back as the movie's 2005 DVD release; a #ReleaseTheSchumacherCut movement first appeared in 2017 and experienced a dramatic surge in popularity following the passing of Joel Schumacher in June 2020. However, Warner Bros has stated that they have no plans to release it and are unsure if the footage has survived. = Revival and editing = In March 2019, after months of speculation, Snyder confirmed his original cut did exist, and stated that it was up to Warner Bros. to release it. In November, an insider claimed that Warner Bros. was unlikely to release Snyder's version in any form, calling such hopes a \\"pipe dream\\". However, the following month, Snyder posted a photo in his Vero account, showing boxes with tapes labeled \\"Z.S. J.L Director's cut\\", with the caption \\"Is it real? Does it exist? Of course it does.\\" According to Snyder, he initially imagined that his cut would never see a release, but snippets could potentially be included in a documentary. Robert Greenblatt, then-WarnerMedia chairman and head of HBO Max, stated that discussions surrounding the release of Snyder's Justice League began in late 2019, and that they lasted a few months. According to Snyder, WarnerMedia decided to move forward with the Snyder Cut in February 2020, after chairman Toby Emmerich acknowledged the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut movement and reached out to Snyder. The Snyders invited executives from Warner Bros., HBO Max, and DC to their home to view the Snyder Cut. Snyder also presented ideas, which included potentially releasing the cut in episodes. Impressed, the executives decided to let the project proceed. Snyder began to reassemble the film's original post-production team to finish the cut. The effort was almost thwarted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which was escalating around the time, but the Snyders pushed to continue with it. Snyder notified the original cast of the undertaking between April and May 2020; according to Snyder, Fisher initially thought he was joking. On May 20, 2020, Snyder announced during a Q&A; after an online watch party of Man of Steel that his cut of Justice League would be released as Zack Snyder's Justice League on HBO Max in 2021. Greenblatt said WarnerMedia tried to get the news out \\"as quickly as possible\\" before HBO Max launched on May 27. Snyder, who had not yet seen the theatrical cut, described his cut as \\"an entirely new thing, and, especially talking to those who have seen the released movie, a new experience apart from that movie.\\" The Snyders felt that being able to finally finish Justice League would bring them closure, and were excited by the prospect of expanding the film's character development. At that point, it was unclear what format Zack Snyder's Justice League would take for the release, whether as a four-hour-long film or a six-part miniseries. The Hollywood Reporter wrote that it was expected to cost $20‚Äì30 million to complete the visual effects, score, and editing. However, Greenblatt indicated the release would be \\"wildly expensive\\" and cost more than the reported $30 million to complete. It was initially believed that the project would not involve reshoots with the original cast, which Snyder wanted to perform but was not given permission by HBO. On June 23, 2020, Sandra Dewey, president of productions and business operations for WarnerMedia, stated in an interview that they are aiming for an \\"early to mid-2021\\" release. On September 23, 2020, it was revealed that Snyder was prepping for a shoot in October, despite earlier reports that the work would not involve additional photography. Affleck, Cavill, Gadot, and Fisher were reported to be reprising their roles for the shoot. It was also reported that, with the cost of the additional shoot, the budget was estimated to be around $70 million. The reshoots began by October 6.  Release  Zack Snyder's Justice League is set to be released around early to mid-2021 on HBO Max. It will be initially released in four separate one hour episodes, followed by a version which edits all four parts together into one film. Snyder also confirmed that DC and WB are currently working on other distribution plans for the cut in international markets where HBO Max is not available. The cut will be released in a 1.66:1 aspect ratio. = Marketing = Alongside the announcement of Zack Snyder's Justice League, HBO released posters depicting the six members of the Justice League. Although these posters had previously been used for the theatrical film's marketing campaign, the HBO ones featured a black-and-white filter and strongly emphasized Snyder's name. Chris Agar of Screen Rant called the filter \\"a stark contrast from the colorful Justice League posters that were prevalent in the buildup to the theatrical release, which is most definitely an intentional choice to separate the two versions of the movie.\\" Snyder announced on May 22, 2020 that a trailer was in the works. A brief teaser, featuring Wonder Woman, a voiceover of Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, and the reveal of Darkseid, was released on June 18. On July 25, 2020, an official clip was released with the reveal of black suit Superman during Justice Con 2020. On August 22, 2020, the first teaser was released during the DC FanDome event. It was well received from audiences and critics alike. = Reactions = The announcement of Zack Snyder's Justice League was celebrated by the #ReleasetheSnyderCut movement, with many fans expressing their enthusiasm on social media. Some Snyder fans uploaded videos of them destroying their DVD and Blu-ray copies of the theatrical cut. Many industry figures, such as cast members of Justice League, expressed their gratitude to the fans who supported the release of Snyder's version of the film. However, some journalists expressed concern that WarnerMedia was conceding to fans who had engaged in forms of harassment and trolling during the movement, which they feared would set a negative precedent. Screen Rant wrote that it sent the message that fan pressuring can work to influence film studios, networks, and streaming services. In response to this concern, CEO of HBO Max Tony Goncalves reiterated the passion of the fandom and denied such claims, affirming that as a business they listen to demand from consumers.

Early life and education  Matthew Smyth or Smith was born in Lancaster.\\"The History and Antiquities of the Colleges and Halls in the University of Oxford\\":, Vol 3 p364 √† Wood, A: Oxford; Clarendon; 1786 One of his contemporary relations, Gilbert Smith, held the Archdeaconry of Peterborough. Matthew Smith began his Bachelor of Arts degree at Oxford (Oriel College) in 1501; he was a Fellow of Oriel from 1506 to 1512. Ralph Churton notes that Smith is frequently documented as a regent Master from 1509 onward. In 1545, he was named Bachelor of divinity.  Brasen Nose  Smith then became Principal of Brasenose Hall on 24 August 1510. He remained so until his death in 1547/8, serving during the foundation of Brasenose as a College. He was recorded as the \\"Principal of the College and Hall of Brasen Nose\\" in 1514. (One other former Principal of Brasenose Hall, John Formby, held a similar title during the transition period.) Falconer Madan, a Fellow of Brasenose and later Librarian of Bodleian Library, suggested in a 1909 \\"Quatercentenary\\" reflection that the continuity established by Smith proceeding from the administration of Brasenose Hall to presiding over Brasenose College is unique among other Oxford colleges. As Principal, Smith presided over a college of twelve Fellows, six senior and six junior (including a Vice-Principal and Bursar), as well as 60 or 70 students. His responsibilities included providing surety for university students committing infractions, as recorded in the Registrum Cancellarii for a student named \\"Hastyngs\\" in August 1512. During this time, Smith also received various preferments for positions in the Anglican Church. Sources conflict on whether William Smyth, a co-founder of Brasenose College, was definitely related to Matthew Smith/Smyth and therefore granted him the position through nepotism. Churton wrote in an 1800 biography of William Smyth: > Matthew Smyth, the first Principal of Brasen Nose college, is intitled[sic] > to a place here by his personal merits and probable kin to the Founder, > though none of the pedigrees of the family, which I have seen, acknowledge > him; not have I been able, from any other quarter, fully to authenticate the > fact.  Death and legacy  Smith died on February 6 in 1547/8 and was buried in Oxford at St. Mary's. Smith's will is dated 11 December 1547.

Briand led the Global Influenza Programme during the 2009 swine flu pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Briand launched the WHO Information Network for Epidemics which looked to counter the spread of coronavirus misinformation.  Early life and education  Briand completed her doctorate in medicine at Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse. After graduating, she completed a master's degree in public health and a doctorate in epidemiology. She started her medical career working in the H√¥pitaux de Toulouse. Briand became increasingly interested in public health, and worked with the European Commission in South America on PROCED, a project which looked to control the re-emergence of cholera in South America.  Research and career  In 1999, Briand joined CREDES international, a public health consultancy. In 2001 she joined the World Health Organization (WHO). Her first role at the WHO was as medical officer in the Global Task force on Cholera Control, where she developed technical guidance for the management of cholera. She was appointed lead for the Yellow Fever Initiative. The Yellow Fever Initiative saw 100 million people being vaccinated in Africa, which eliminated yellow fever outbreaks in West Africa. The 2016 yellow fever outbreak in Angola created an urgent need for 28 million vaccinations, which exhausted the global supply. In response to this outbreak, Briand launched the Eliminate Yellow fever Epidemics initiative, which looked to (1) protect the most vulnerable populations, (2) prevent the spread of yellow fever internationally and (3) contain local outbreaks quickly. In her next role at the WHO, Briand joined the influenza group, and was promoted to Director of the Global Influenza Programme in 2009. In 2012 she was made Director of the Pandemic and Epidemic Diseases, which oversees projects on antimicrobial resistance, the WHO pandemic preparedness framework and several disease control programmes. In 2013 Briand worked with UNICEF to launch the Battle against Respiratory Viruses (BRaVe) initiative, which recognised acute respiratory infections represent a significant public health problem. Briand emphasised that 97% of deaths due to pneumonia occur in the developing world. The BRaVE initiative created a public health agenda that addressed gaps of knowledge on respiratory infections, partnered with decision making bodies and engaged with the pharmaceutical industry. In 2017 Briand was involved with the launch of OpenWHO, a massive open online course that trained first responders in how to handle medical emergencies. The MOOC included four channels, covering outbreaks, emergency responses, social skills and emergency field work. She established EDCARN, a network of clinicians all around the world who trained health workers to fight the Western African Ebola virus epidemic. She developed a pocket guide which outlined best practise on the management of Ebola patients with viral haemorrhagic fever which was distributed around community care centres and Ebola treatment units. Alongside providing acute medical advice, Briand emphasised the need to engage communities to stop the spread of the disease, as well as burying patients who die with dignity and appropriate safety precautions. The management of Ebola was a complex challenge; making burials safe required the World Health Organization to adapt their advice to address local beliefs. After the Ebola outbreak, Briand called for more social scientists to be involved with the management of epidemics. She hoped that this would help to understand why people do or do not cooperate with public health advice, and how to better design and adapt interventions so that they were more efficient and effective. Briand was closely involved with the WHO response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Amidst the extraordinary number of scientific studies, coronavirus disease inspired considerable misinformation and pseudoscience. Working with the WHO, Briand led the creation of the Information Network for Epidemics, a strategy to counter the infodemic that spread online. She encouraged people, including politicians, to avoid shaking hands, and instead use elbow bumps or footshakes. In May 2020, Briand emphasised that it was crucial to know how SARS-CoV-2 evolved. She said that the WHO were surprised by the lack of global preparedness in fighting coronavirus disease. She believes that after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, countries prepared; they created stockpiles and made plans. But the 2009 swine flu pandemic was deemed \\"not all that bad\\", and the world experienced what Briand deemed \\"pandemic fatigue\\". Making use of the OpenWHO, Briand launched an online programme in coronavirus disease.

In 2019, DJ Lag notably collaborated with Tierra Whack, Beyonc√©, Moonchild Sanelly, Nija, Yemi Alade, and Busiswa on a track called \\"My Power\\" on Beyonc√©'s record, The Lion King: The Gift. Early life With aspirations of becoming a soccer player growing up in Durban, Lag suffered an ankle injury which derailed his pursuits. His cousin, a rapper within the Durban hip hop scene at the time, then introduced him to FL Studio, on which he taught himself to produce. Following this, he began to explore DJing. He went on to play his first gig at Durban's club Uhuru during a high school graduation event while he was in 10th grade.  Career  Releasing his first EP on Whatsapp, DJ Lag began is career using methods unorthodox to Western distribution methods common in Gqom's formative years. Fans signed up on the DJ's website with the promise that an exclusive EP would be delivered to them via the mobile messaging app free of charge, with the help of Black Major, an artist management agency based in Cape Town. DJ Lag's specific style is known to be focused on what local producers dubbed \\"uthayela\\" (an isiZulu word for \\"corrugated iron\\" which describes the rough timbre and hard bass-lines specifically made for listening to in club settings. In late 2016 at the age of 21, DJ Lag made his live global debut at the Unsound Festival in Poland and finishing up at Seoul‚Äôs Cake Shop nearly a month later. Since then, he‚Äôs performed at Afropunk New York City and secured a residency at RinseFM. He also embarked on a four-part worldwide tour called #GqomIsThePresent and was featured on BBC Radio 1, including shows by Diplo and Benji B, with a BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix set hosted by Pete Tong. DJ Lag was a featured speaker at the 2019 Amsterdam Dance Event (ADE). In 2019, he released a 6 track EP entitled UHURU under Diplo's American record label, Good Enuff Records, under the Mad Decent umbrella. This album payed homage to DJ Lag's hometown club of the same name, which acted as a monumental meeting place for Gqom producers such as Rudeboyz and Naked Boyz, to try out new techniques on larger audiences. In 2019, DJ Lag began to curate and host his own event, called Something For Clermont where new acts are encouraged to experiment with sounds contributing to the evolution of the genre, the first of which was held in partnership with music broadcaster Boiler Room. Collaborations My Power from Beyonce's The Lion King: The Gift = DJ Lag co-produced a track that was initially released as Drumming alongside percussionist Moses Boyd, which was later chosen by Beyonce to form part of the collaborative album, The Lion King: The Gift, which featured American rapper Tierra Whack, Busiswa, Yemi Alade and Moonchild Sanelly. = Anywhere We Go with Shekhinah = DJ Lag and Shekhinah collaborated on Anywhere We Go as part of an adidas campaign.

It is a game that is widely practiced among children and is called as different names depending on the regions. Some of those names are biseokchagi (ÎπÑÏÑùÏ∞®Í∏∞), biseokkagi (ÎπÑÏÑùÍπåÍ∏∞), mogjakkagi (Î™©ÏûêÍπåÍ∏∞), jakkagi (ÏûêÍπåÍ∏∞), bisasaeggi (ÎπÑÏÇ¨ÏÉâÍ∏∞), etc. Etymologically it means tombstone. This game can be played by just two people, but it is more fun to have several people split into 2 teams. After determining the order, one team place its stones side by side at regular intervals. Then, the other team throws its stones and knocks down the opponent's stones at a certain distance. At this time, if this team turns over all the opponent's stones, they win. If they do not, the turn to play is passed to the other team. Origin Biseokchigi is a game with a long history, but it is difficult to find a record of its origin ‚àíthus the various names by which it is known in different areas‚àí giving that it is only required to play a few flat stones and an open space or yard. However, according to the origins of the oral tradition, the background of this game reflects the late Joseon era. There are many places called Monument Streets all over the country, and this is a place name given to the monuments standing side by side. Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (2016) How to play Since this game is played nationwide, the method of play differs slightly from region to region. Korea Creative Content Agency # Draw two long lines at a distance of 4 ~ 5m. # Each person prepares a palm-sized stone then each captain or player, if they are not playing in teams, uses a rock-paper- scissors to decide who will attack first. # The losing team must place the stone vertically on the previously drawn line while the winners throw their stones trying to knock down the rival's. There are several stages of biseokchigi, as you can simply throw the rock while standing or carry it with your shoulder, head, feet or even your armpit and drop it off. # If the opponent's stone cannot be knocked down or is missed while moving, the attacker will change # The person or team who has passed the whole process and its stone remain standing wins.

He was an All-American college player at Michigan State University and went on to become the all-time leading scorer in the Eastern Basketball Association (later known as the Continental Basketball Association). McCoy played for Farrell High School in Farrell, Pennsylvania, where he led the team to the 1952 Pennsylvania State championship. He scored 1,471 career points for Farrell, a record that still stood at the time of his death in 2008. An undersized forward in high school, he was the tallest player on the 1952 squad at just over six feet tall. He was recruited by Michigan State to play college football by then-assistant Duffy Daugherty, and chose the Spartans because he would have the opportunity to play basketball, which he ultimately chose to pursue. Nicknamed \\"Hooks\\" for the size of his hands, McCoy played for coach Pete Newell and was an immediate impact player as a sophomore. He averaged 18.6 points per game, a mark which dipped to 16.7 the following year. In his senior season, McCoy broke out, scoring 27.3 points per game ‚Äì good for second in the Big Ten Conference behind Robin Freeman of Ohio State. At the close of his senior campaign, McCoy was named a third-team All-American by both the Associated Press and United Press International and was selected first-team All-Big Ten. After the close of his college career, McCoy was drafted by the St. Louis Hawks in the 1956 NBA draft. However, he was also drafted into the U.S. Army and served in the military, resuming his basketball career with the Williamsport Billies of the Eastern Basketball Association (EBA) in 1958. He averaged 24.3 points in the 1958‚Äì59 season and earned EBA Rookie of the Year honors. He played twelve seasons in the league, primarily for the Billies and the Sunbury Mercuries, and was the all-time leading scorer in the league's history (prior to it becoming the Continental Basketball Association in 1977) and won the league MVP award in 1966. In 1995, McCoy was named to the CBA's 50th anniversary team. After the conclusion of his playing career, McCoy served as a teacher and head boys' coach for John Harris High School in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania from 1971 to 1983. He then worked in the Pennsylvania Bureau of Transportation until his retirement in 2004. McCoy died of complications from diabetes on April 4, 2008 at age 76.

Aside from teaching, she worked with the poor, advocated for peace and the Catholic Worker Movement.  Early life  Anne Montgomery was born on November 20, 1926 in San Diego California to a small family. She had one sibling, a younger brother. Montgomery was born into a Navy family which meant that she moved around a great deal during her childhood. She attended Eden Hall Academy of the Sacred Heart in Torresdale, Pennsylvania and Manhattanville College, graduating with a bachelor's and master's degree. She later earned a second master's degree from Columbia University in New York.  Society of the Sacred Heart  In 1948, when Montgomery was 22 years old, she entered the Society of the Sacred Heart (RSCJ) in Albany. She made her first vows in 1951 and her final vows in 1956 in Rome. She taught at the Covenant of the Sacred Heart in New York City from 1959-1969 and at Street Academy of Albany in 1970. In 1975, she began educating children with learning disabilities. In the late 1970s, she returned to New York City to work with high school dropouts in East Harlem. In the late 1970s, Montgomery joined the Catholic Worker House in New York, which was part of the Catholic Worker Movement. She was also a part of the Little Sisters of the Assumption in East Harlem. She became an advocate for peace, determined to disarm nuclear weapons using nonviolent tactics.  Activism  Plowshares Movement = In 1980, Montgomery joined the Plowshares Eight which was an anti-nuclear weapons and Christian pacifist movement. The movement often consisted of members calling for the abolition of nuclear weapons. Some members of the movement damaged nuclear weapons and military bases to directly disarm the facilities. Montgomery was among the first that were arrested for these acts, and served time in prison. She participated in several other Plowshares movement actions, including one in 2009, at the age of 83. In 1987 Montgomery helped write and edit a book titled ‚ÄúSwords into Plowshares‚Äù which is about the nonviolent direct action for disarmament, peace, and social justice. = Other peace activism = In the late 1970s, Montgomery became a member of the Christian Peacemaker Teams (CPT), and the Pax Christi, which is the national catholic peace movement. Throughout the 90s, she travelled to places of conflict in Iraq, West Bank, Hebron, and the Balkans. In January 1991, she protested against the US bombing Iraq. She supported the Gulf Peace Team Camp on the Iraq-Saudi border which was there to provide a nonviolent presence before and during the initial stages of the war, and in 2000 she fasted for a month to show her disapproval of US support for the UN sanctions against Iraq. In 2005, she participated in a 70-mile walk and a four-day fast and vigil with the organization witness against torture, which worked toward the closing of the Guantanamo Naval Base. Anne Montgomery said the following regarding her peace activism: ‚Äúcivil disobedience is, traditionally, the breaking of a civil law to obey a higher law, sometimes with the hope of changing the unjust civil law. ‚Ä¶ But we should speak of such actions as divine obedience, rather than civil disobedience. The term ‚Äòdisobedience‚Äô is not appropriate because any law that does not protect and enhance human life is no real law.‚Äù  Later life and death  In 2012 Montgomery won the Courage of Conscience Award from the Peace Abbey in Sherborn, Massachusetts one week before her death. She died on August 27, 2012, at the age of 85 at Oakwood in Sacred Heart, Atherton, California.

SloCo was founded in 2017 by sloth researcher Dr. Rebecca Cliffe. SloCo is a local non-profit focused on a community-based approach that encourage people and sloths to coexist in a mutually beneficial way.  History  Bradypus variegatus) being monitored as part of Dr. Rebecca Cliffe's Sloth Backpack Project.alt= While researching sloths in Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia and Brazil over a period of 10 years, Dr. Cliffe witnessed firsthand the various threats faced by wild sloth populations. SloCo was born out of the need to protect wild sloth populations while furthering the scientific understanding of these poorly understood species.  Activities  Bradypus variegatus) crossing a road using a rope bridge. Loss of habitat due to rainforest urbanisation (including power line electrocutions, dog attacks and traffic collisions) agriculture, climate change, wildlife trade and irresponsible ecotourism (i.e. wildlife selfies) are some of the main threats that sloths face. Sloths are now considered to be a conservation concern in Costa Rica, and, according to a 2017 report published by the World Animal Protection, Costa Rica is one of the top ten worst countries for selfies with wild animals. alt= = Combating habitat fragmentation = Nursery saplings with recycled plastic bottle protectors. Due to their slow nature and highly specialized arboreal lifestyle, sloths are particularly sensitive to the effects of habitat fragmentation and degradation. Without a natural or artificial canopy bridge, the only way for a sloth to cross between trees in disturbed areas is by crawling on the ground. Crossing on the ground takes a lot of time and energy as their specialised muscle structure is adapted for hanging in trees, and, as a result, they often get hit by cars while crossing roads. To combat the effects of development, SloCo restores and protects critical sloth habitat through reforestation with tree species favoured by sloths. As a part of their Connected Gardens Project, SloCo installs ‚Äòsloth crossing‚Äô canopy bridges to connect forest fragments in disturbed areas. These bridges give sloths and other wildlife a safe way to travel across roads and navigate urban areas without having to risk coming to the ground. = Preventing dog attacks and electrocutions = When sloths come to the ground they are at a higher risk for dog attacks, which are a leading cause of death for sloths in Costa Rica. With the aim of reducing the probability of dog attacks on sloths, SloCo funds the sterilization of stray dogs, as part of their Oh My Dog campaign, to reduce the overall number of dogs roaming freely in Costa Rica. SloCo also provides funding to insulate power lines to prevent the electrocution of sloths and other types of wildlife, which number in the thousands every year in Costa Rica. = Teaching responsible tourism = Lessons about sloths taught at local schools. SloCo coordinates online and local education programs to encourage the protection rather than the exploitation of wildlife. Awareness is raised on the issue of wildlife trade through educational campaigns and speaking out against organizations that exploit wildlife. Due to pressure from SloCo and other concerned parties, two organizations known for their exploitation of sloths and other wildlife (Dade City‚Äôs Wild Things and Alligator Attraction at John's Pass) have ceased these activities. = Conducting research = To further ongoing conservation projects, SloCo funds and coordinates high-quality scientific research on sloths published in open-access, peer-reviewed journals. The director of SloCo, Rebecca Cliffe has published various studies providing new insights into the biology, ecology, genetics and physiology of all six sloth species and continues to conduct research to improve the scientific understanding and conservation efforts of sloths in the wild.

It is situated in North Cascades National Park, on the shared border of Chelan County and Skagit County. Despite its position only southwest of Easy Pass, and west of the North Cascades Highway, it is not visible from either. Its nearest higher peak is Black Peak, to the southeast. Mount Arriva has a secondary summit, called East Peak (8,160+ ft), which was first climbed in August 1940 by Fred Beckey, Jim Crooks, and Ed Kennedy. The first ascent of the true summit (West Peak) was made July 6, 1966, by Joe and Joan Firey, John and Irene Meulemans. Climate Mount Arriva is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. This climate supports a small glacier on the northeast side of the peak. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Precipitation runoff from Mount Arriva drains into tributaries of the Stehekin and Skagit Rivers. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

It is not, as popularly supposed, a variant of Blackjack nor is Pontoon derived from Blackjack, but both are descended from the early British version of Vingt-Un. In Britain, it first became known as Pontoon during the First World War, the name apparently being a soldier's corruption of its former French name. The games has no official rules and varies widely from place to place. It is a popular family game, but also widely played by children, students and in the armed forces. In 1981, Pontoon was the 3rd most popular card game in Britain after Rummy and Whist. It has been described as \\"an amusing round game and one which anyone can learn in a few minutes.\\"  History  Vingt-Un is first recorded in the second half of the 18th century in France, Britain and Prussia, but its first rules were published in 1800 in Britain, and elaborations of this simple game were developed over the course of the 19th century. The name \\"Pontoon\\" appeared during the First World War and appears to be a soldier's corruption of Vingt-Un. It is recorded as such in 1917 by an American soldier who served with the British during the First World War, where he describes Pontoon as one of the pastimes played by \\"Tommy\\" when off duty and equates it to the American \\"Black Jack or Twenty-One\\", adding that \\"the banker is the only winner.\\" Another name that was probably also a mispronunciation was Van John. It took time for the new name to be established; in 1939 it was still referred to as Vingt-et-Un with the name Pontoon being given as an alternative. The game's popularity continued unabated such that, by 1981, it had become the 3rd most popular card game in Britain after Rummy and Whist, a phenomenon possibly helped by the prominence of its casino game forms known as Blackjack or Twenty-One. Unlike the latter, however, it has no official rules and consequently its manner of play varies widely from place to place. It is very much an informal family game, but is also popular with children, students, workers and members of the armed forces.  Rules  The following rules give a brief illustration of the development of Pontoon from its progenitor Vingt-Un as it was played around 1800, to the more elaborated rules developed during the 19th century and finally to Pontoon as it is typically played today. = Cards = The game is played with a standard, 52-card, French-suited pack, without Jokers. The values of the cards are as follows: an Ace scores 1 or 11 as desired; court cards score 10 each and the pip cards score their face value. If the two cards dealt to a player (excluding any subsequently drawn) are an Ace and a court card or an Ace and a Ten, they scores 21 exactly and the combination is called a natural or a natural vingt-un. The game may be played by two or more players, six or eight being best according to \\"Trumps\\" and five or six according to Arnold, who sets an upper limit of ten players. Phillips and Westall suggest the use of a second pack if more than seven play. \\"Trumps\\" merely states that two or more packs may be combined \\"if the party is large\\". = Vingt-Un (1800) = The following is a summary of the earliest known rules for Vingt-Un, published in the 1800 edition of Hoyle's Games. The first dealer is chosen by any agreed method, e.g. the first player to turn up an Ace becomes the dealer. It is likely that deal and play were clockwise and that players staked a fixed amount before the deal, but the rules are vague on these points. The dealer deals two cards to each player, one at a time. He then asks each player, in rotation and beginning with eldest hand (to his left), whether he wants to 'stand' or choose another card. In the latter case, the dealer gives him the top card from the pack. The player may continue to ask for more cards until he reaches or exceeds a score of 21 or decides to stand. If he exceeds 21, he immediately throws his cards up and pays his stake to the dealer. The dealer may also draw additional cards and, on taking Vingt-un, receives double stakes from all who stand, except those who also have 21, with whom it is a drawn game. When any opponent has 21, but the dealer does not, the dealer pays double stakes. If no-one has 21, the dealer pays a single stake to those whose score is higher than his and receives a single stake from those whose score is lower. Any player with the same score as the dealer neither pays nor receives a stake. If the dealer exceeds 21, he pays all who have not 'thrown up' their cards. The first player in rotational order who declares a Natural Vingt-Un takes over as the next dealer and earns a double stake from all players except those who also have one, who need not pay anything. The new dealer reshuffles the pack and deals afresh. Otherwise, the cards must be dealt out in succession, the pone (youngest hand) collecting the cards that have been played and shuffling them until the pack is exhausted, whereupon the same dealer re-deals. = Vingt-Un (1850) = By 1850, the rules had been elaborated as follows: The deal rotates clockwise every time a natural vingt- un occurs. The custom that the player holding the natural vingt-un takes over the deal is an \\"old mode of play\\" that many still adhered to. If the natural vingt-un occurs in the first round, the dealer is allowed a misericorde (reprieve) and retains the deal. After the dealer has dealt the first card each, face down, each player places a stake on it; it may be as low as a single counter. At this point, the dealer looks at his card and may announce \\"double\\", which doubles all the stakes. He then distributes the second card to each player and, lastly, to himself. The dealer now looks at his cards and, if he has a natural vingt-un he declares it and collects double stakes. Otherwise he proceeds as before, inviting players to stand or call for more cards, one by one. A player exceeding 21 is said to be 'overdrawn'. When the dealer has gone around everyone else, he turns his own cards face up and may stand or add to his hand as well. Those scoring the same or less, pay him their stake; those scoring more receive the same amount as their stake from the dealer and those who have a vingt-un receive double. If by drawing, the dealer scores exactly 21, he receives double stakes, excepting any ties and those who have already thrown up. If he exceeds 21, he pays all who stand, paying any vingt- uns double. If a player has a natural vingt-un but the dealer does not, he does not, as in the 1800 rules, receive a double stake from each player, but only settles with the dealer. Pairs and Triplets. If a player or the dealer turns up a pair, e.g. two Kings, he may 'go on both' and play them as separate hands. Likewise if the 3rd card is of the same rank, three hands may be played. Brulet. After the cards have been cut, the dealer may look for the brulet i.e. a natural vingt-un formed by the top and bottom cards of the pack. These cards are thrown out and mixed with those collected by the poney. Brulet clears the board of stakes (one or two counters levied on each player at the start of the game) or takes the amount of the limit (e.g. 6d) from each player, as agreed. = Pontoon (1939) = The following rules for Vingt-et-Un (Pontoon) are based on Phillips and Westall (1939). The player who draws the highest card becomes the first dealer and is known as the Banker. The game is played for stakes: money, counters or matches. After the first card is dealt, players look at their cards before placing a stake of their choosing up to an agreed limit. Again, the dealer may double the stakes after looking at his card. Any player who has a Natural on receiving his second card, declares it immediately, exposes his cards and, unless the dealer also has a Natural, is paid treble and takes the Bank for the next deal. If more than one player has a Natural, the one nearest the dealer's left takes it. Player are now asked whether they wish to 'buy' or 'twist' any more cards. Players may buy cards by giving as many counters for them as they like (e.g. \\"buy one for two\\"), up to their original stake; the card is then passed to them face down. Players may ask for a twisted card (\\"twist me one\\"), which is passed face upwards. A player cannot buy a card once he has had one twisted. Once satisfied with their cards, players announce \\"stand\\". A player exceeding 21 must declare that he is 'busted'. Players who are busted, pay their stake to the dealer. If the dealer has a Natural, he receives single stakes from any player who has a Natural, double stakes from any player who has 21 or \\"five and under\\" and treble stakes from the others. If the dealer has 12 or \\"five and under\\", he receives a single stake from any player who has the same, and double stakes from the rest. Otherwise the dealer pays double to anyone with 21 or \\"five and under\\" and single stakes to any player whose total is better than his own. He receives single stakes from anyone who scores less than him. A player with the same score also has to pay. Pairs may be played as two separate hands by announcing \\"split\\", but the brulet is not known. The Bank does not pass on a split Natural. = Pontoon (2011) = The rules of modern Pontoon vary widely. Those below are based on a description by Arnold of the standard rules. All is as in the 1939 rules except as follows. The first player to draw a Jack becomes the dealer or banker. Players place stakes of any value between the agreed lower and upper limits after looking at their first card. The banker may not look at his cards or double the stakes. Any player who holds a pontoon (Ace and 10-point card) on being dealt his second card declares it immediately and places it on the table. As before, the banker then asks each player in turn what they wish to do: stand or 'stick', buy or twist. A player may not stand on a score of lower than 16. A player may buy up to 5 cards, which beats everything except a pontoon. A player may not buy a fifth card unless he already has 12 points. He may, however, twist. Players do not pay for twisted cards, but may not buy after having twisted. Players who have busted, lose their stake and pass their cards to the banker who places them face down under the pack. Players do not show their cards during this process. Players may only split if they have two (or more) Aces. Once the banker has gone around all the players, he exposes his two cards. If he has a pontoon, he claims all remaining stakes, even from players with a pontoon themselves. Otherwise he may stand or deal himself more cards. He may not split. If he has a five-card hand, he beats all other hands except a pontoon. The banker wins all ties. If he busts, he pays all those still in the game. A player with a pontoon is paid double, unless it is part of a split hand. The banker is not paid double for a pontoon. Once a player beats the banker with a pontoon, he takes over the deal if he wishes. If two or more players have a pontoon, positional priority applies.

As of December 31, 2019, LME Copper contracts are associated with 144,675 tonnes of physical copper stored in LME approved warehouses around the world, or around 0.7% of 2019 world copper production of 20.6 million metric tonnes. Despite the small share of physical copper associated with LME Copper contracts, their prices act as reference prices for physical global copper transactions. This practice started in 1966, when Zambia, Chile, and most Copper-producing countries abandoned fixed price copper contracts, and announced that they would set copper contract prices based the average monthly price of the nearest contract month LME Copper futures contract. This pattern of using LME futures contract prices as reference prices for physical transactions spread to other base metals in the 1970s, and for Aluminium in the 1980s. Contract Description LME Copper contracts trade on the London Metal Exchange, which began trading in the metal at the start of the exchange in 1877. The contracts require physical delivery of the asset for settlement, and deliverable assets for the contracts are 25 tonnes of Grade A copper cathode. The contracts prices are quoted in US dollars per tonne. LME prices have minimum tick sizes of $0.50 per tonne (or $12.50 for one contract) for open outcry trading in the LME Ring and electronic trading on LMEselect, while minimum tick sizes are reduced for inter-office telephone trading to $0.01 per tonne (or $0.50 for one contract). Carry trades involving Aluminium futures also have reduced minimum tick sizes at $0.01 per tonne. Contracts are organized along LME's prompt date (or delivery date) structure. =Prompt date structure= LME offers three groups of LME Copper contracts with daily, weekly, and monthly delivery dates. Contracts with daily settlement dates are available from two days to three months in the future, which means that on 2020-05-12, contracts with daily delivery dates for 2020-05-14, 2020-05-18, 2020-05-19 ... 2020-08-10, 2020-08-11, and 2020-08-12 are available for trading. Contracts with weekly settlement dates are available from three months to six months in the future, which means that on 2020-05-12, contracts with weekly delivery dates for 2020-08-12, 2020-08-19, 2020-08-26 ... 2020-11-12, 2020-11-18, and 2020-11-25 are available for trading. Contracts with monthly settlement dates are available from six months to 123 months in the future, which means that on 2020-05-12, contracts with monthly delivery dates for 2020-05-20, 2020-06-17, 2020-07-15, ... 2030-06-19, 2030-07-17, and 2030-08-21 are available for trading. The origins of the LME prompt date system, in particular the three months daily prompt date system, actually originated with LME Copper trading at the beginning of the exchange. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 reduced the London delivery time of Tin from Malaya to match the three months delivery time for Copper from Chile. When the LME was founded in 1877 based on Copper and Tin trading, the exchange instituted the daily prompt date contracts to match the delivery times of those commodities. Non-commercial uses LME Copper contracts with delivery dates up to 123 months into the future are available, and prices of those contracts can produce forecasts of the spot price of Copper at those delivery times. However, LME Copper price forecasts of spot copper prices were found to exhibit biases. LME Copper futures prices are also a part of the S&P; GSCI commodity index, which is a benchmark index widely followed in financial markets by traders and institutional investors. Its weighting in these commodity indices give LME Copper futures prices non-trivial influence on returns on a wide range of investment funds and portfolios. Conversely, traders and investors have become non-trivial participants in the market for LME Copper contracts, and have had a better track record than commercial participants in the copper supply chain at predicting copper industrial cycles. LME Copper has been used as important financial and economic signals. Contract prices have been used as signals for general financial market conditions and equity market return. They have also been used as leading indicators for economic activity and business cycles. Related derivatives The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) also offer Copper futures contracts. Market studies have show that all three markets are closely linked, and that LME traded copper contracts are the dominant source of price discovery for the other exchanges. Financial market conventions and empirical studies have grouped copper futures contracts with other base metals futures contracts together as an asset class or a sub-asset class. The Base Metals grouping usually includes futures contracts on Aluminium (sometimes including Aluminium Alloy contracts), Copper, Lead, Nickel, Tin, and Zinc, and they are also sometimes called Industrial Metals, Non-ferrous Metals, and Non-precious Metals. All of the metals in this group have associated LME contracts available for trading. Sumitomo copper affair From 1986 to 1996, the head Copper trader of Sumitomo corporation, Yasuo Hamanaka, sought to manipulate the LME Copper market by secretly building a dominant market position in LME Copper spot and futures markets. Through facetious purchasing and sale agreements, Hamanaka established the illusion of a large commercial Copper operation at Sumitomo, which allowed him to purchase large amounts of LME Copper futures contracts and warrants to corner the LME Copper market. By November 24, 1995, Hamanaka controlled 93% of all of outstanding LME copper warrants, which are claims on physical copper in the LME warehouse system. Hamanaka's Copper market position led world copper prices to rise rapidly, which led to physical copper leaving COMEX warehouses to LME warehouses, notably LME's Long Beach warehouse. The rapid movement of Copper prices and of physical Copper out of COMEX warehouses lead to investigations by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Investments Board (SIB). Ultimately, Sumitomo cooperated with these investigations and dismissed Hamanaka, which lead Hamanaka to confess in 1996. Hamanaka's speculative position contributed to LME Contract prices to rise to $2800 per metric tonne in May 1996, and Sumitomo's subsequent unwinding of that position contributed to those same prices to plunge to $1785 per metric tonne, a two and a half year low, on June 25, 1996 almost two months later. The affair costed Sumitomo $2.6 billion USD in losses. Chapter 7: Sumitomo, pp. 97‚Äì101. In response to the affair, LME began to publish more meaningful open interest data, information on large warrant and trading positions, and daily LME warehouse stocks for all relevant LME contracts, including LME Copper contracts. Chapter 1: Background: key issues, pp. 11-12. The affair also led seventeen commodity market regulators from sixteen countries met at the Tokyo Commodity Futures Markets Regulators' Conference to discuss proposed regulatory oversight of the world's commodity futures markets in 1997. The market regulators endorsed futures markets best practices, standards of market surveillance, and intentions for regulatory information sharing among the endorsing countries. State Reserve Bureau copper scandal The State Reserves Bureau Copper Scandal refers to a loss of approximately $150 million USD as a result of trading LME Copper futures contracts at the London Metal Exchange (LME) by rogue trader Liu Qibing, who was a trader for the Import and Export Department of the State Regulation Centre for Supply Reserves (SRCSR), the trading agency for the State Reserve Bureau (SRB) of China in 2005.

She had no formal academic qualifications but she created and ran three successful schools when girls were first being offered high school education.  Life  Alger was born on 4 February 1838 at Diss, Norfolk, she was one of several daughters of John Alger, a corn merchant, and his wife Jemima (born Goldworth). Her only brother was the journalist John Goldworth Alger. Her brother went to school and he was writing for the Norfolk News at age sixteen. She had a varied private education and she taught in private schools. She became the first headmistress of the Girls' Public Day School Company (GPDSC) (later Trust) fifth school at Clapham when she was 37. The new middle school opened on Clapham Common on 3 May 1875. The GPDSC was transforming education for girl's in Britain and Alger became one the trusts major assets, despite lacking the formal academic training of other heads. Her employers valued her but they moved her at short notice when she was showing some success. Heads of schools were valued but they would be replaced if the school started to flounder. In 1878 she was moved to Sheffield taking with her Miss E.Woodhouse. The Sheffield High School thrived and Miss Woodhouse was left there as head as Alger was again moved the same year to another school planned by the company for Dulwich. She enjoyed thanks from the Sheffield students but it is Woodhouse who is usually credited as the first head. The new girl's school opened in Dulwich in 1875 with less than 50 pupils. Within ten years there was 400. She was establishing education for girls but some only attended on a temporary basis. Exercise was avoided and the girls opted for botany and not for chemistry. Alger died in Dulwich in 1894 in the house next door to the school. Dulwich High School continued until 1913 when it came under the control of the Church's School Company. It closed in 1938.

It has numerous wildlife habitats from ponds to creeks to a large meadow area, succession forest, freshwater wetlands and the only extensive salt marsh in Westchester. It borders Long Island Sound and can be entered via an easement on the historic Boston Post Road. It is one of 5 properties that together constitute the Boston Post Road Historic District. It has high archaeological sensitivity. The conservancy has also been designated an Important Bird Area History Archaeology supports the presence of a vibrant Paleo-Indian population for thousands of years at the location. Findings include identification of pre-contact deposits from the Archaic and Woodland periods. Map of Boston Post Road Historic District including watercourses Prior to its 20th century partitioning, the Conservancy was originally land belonging to two neighboring estates: the Jay Estate, owned by Founding Father John Jay and his descendants and neighboring Lounsbury owned by the Parsons family. The nature preserve, first named the Devereux Reservation, came into being through two separate real estate donations in 1966 and again in 1977. The initial gift was one of 120 acres from Zilph Palmer Devereux to Westchester County made on November 9, 1966 and formally accepted by the Westchester County Board of Supervisors on November 21, 1966. A small shelter was built in 1972 and the property re-opened as Marshlands Park on June 7, 1972 during the dedication of the preserve. A special volunteer Advisory Board was created to ensure continued oversight of the County's management of the land. Another donation of 17 acres was contributed by Fanny Wickes Parsons in 1977 with the caveat \\"that no garages or maintenance buildings be erected and that no marinas be built on or near the shorefront of the tract.\\" The ensuing property of 147 acres [59 ha] (which includes tidal lands) was rededicated in 1997 as passive parkland by the Board of Legislators of Westchester County \\"The natural area and wildlife sanctuary will be protected, preserved and regulated as a nature and wildlife preserve to be used only for passive recreation.\\" That same year, a Friends group was organized to help staff the shelter and provide tours as well as raise additional funds to supplement the maintenance and mowing of the meadow. FeaturesArchaeological sensitivities= A 1985 report confirmed the importance of Rye Marshlands as one of two sites in Rye with high archaeological significance, the other being an area in the Blind Brook watershed. The discovery of 88 stone fishtail points and fragments, 31 of which were collected between 1981 and 1987 by Stuart Fiedel, further suggests encampments of what is known as an Orient phase or culture at the site. Additional artifacts were found by Wilbur Clark. =Salt marsh and tidal flats= The preserve's salt marsh was recognized in 1987 as a rare ecosystem and tidal flats community by the N.Y.S. Department of State Division of Coastal Resources & Waterfront Revitalization. =Woodland trails and ruins= There are two trail loops. One is 2.8 miles long. Passive recreation only is permitted at Marshlands Conservancy including walking, hiking and birdwatching. Dogs and bikes are strictly forbidden according to regulations adopted on December 31, 1975. Ruins of a summer home built on the property by 20th century owners can be found on the trail. All that remains is a chimney and stone foundation. =Watercourses= The East Stream and West Creek are two watercourses that run through the Marshlands Conservancy. Fauna Marshlands Conservancy is home to many creatures from horseshoe crabs to coyotes. Visitors can see foxes, herons, egrets and more. Nature study is especially focused on salt water life. =Birds= The Conservancy land was donated with the goal of creating a wildlife sanctuary especially for waterfowl and migratory birds. Over 230 species of birds have been spotted from Black rail to American Avocet =Fish and shellfish= Marine life at Marshlands include pipefish, killifish. =Mammals= Deer, fox, coyotes, rabbits and groundhogs are among the mammals that have habitats at the conservancy. FloraNative plants= Native plants historically found at the Conservancy include lopseed, marshmallow, and butterfly weed. =Invasive species= Like many other sanctuaries that are impacted by climate change, the ecology of Marshlands is changing due to the aggressive pressure of invasive species. Non-native threats include mugwort, Japanese knotweed, Japanese stiltgrass, jetbead, multiflora rose, wineberry, Norway maples and garlic mustard. Asian shore crabs have been implicated in the decline of the common periwinkle at Marshlands.

Known as ‚ÄúEl Pintor de Los Toros,‚Äù he painted mostly Spanish bulls and landscapes and he was a pupil of[ Salvador Dal√≠. He held over 300 exhibitions. In 1970, 1971 and 1972 he exhibited with Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dal√¨. He is included in the cultural heritage of Emilia-Romagna and has pictures in several museums, such as ., the in Castelfranco Veneto, and the Gallery of Contemporary Figurative Arts in the Vatican.  Early life and education  Roberto Montanari was born on July 19,1937 in Ravenna, Italy. After the Academy of Fine Arts of Ravenna, in the early Sixties, he went to study the Impressionists in France, but the ones who continued to fascinate him were the Spanish painters of the twentieth century, especially Picasso, Mir√≤ and Dal√¨. For this reason he moved to Madrid, where he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts and where he met Salvador Dal√¨ of whom he was a great admirer during his entire life. He met the bullfighter Gitanillo de Triana II, who was fascinated by the drawings of Montanari bulls and he named him ‚ÄúEl Pintor de Los Toros.‚Äù  Career  After a few years, he came back to Italy and married a fellow academy student, Margherita, in Bologna. In 1967 they moved to Ravenna where they opened an art gallery that they called \\"The Cathedral\\" and the gallery also had several other painters beside Montanari. In those following years Roberto Montanari also began to hang out with friends such as the writer Pier Paolo Pasolini, the painter Antonio Barrera and other intellectuals of the time. A few years later Montanari moved to Vicenza, the city of the architect Andrea Palladio. He received help from his friend Hector Puricelli who in those years coached the Lanerossi Vicenza. In 1972 he opened up another art gallery, this time by himself, which he called \\"El Matador\\", where it was placed a plaque in his memory and which became the cultural center of the city, since he periodically organized meetings with always different characters to connect art with sport, music, theater and cinema. It is in one of these occasions that Montanari's friend and a film director, Sergio Leone, stated that he was going to shoot the movie ‚ÄúOnce upon a time in America.‚Äù In 1976 the weekly magazine \\"Oggi\\" asked Roberto Montanari to do what would be the last interview of the Italian press to Salvador Dal√≠, who in those years was rarely interviewed. \\"El Pintor de los Toros‚Äù accepted but on the condition that he was a journalist friend of his and not an art critic to do the interrogation and for this reason a different and informal report was made of Dal√≠. The Weekly \\"Oggi\\" thanked Montanari in public. In Vicenza he met the painter Virgilio Guidi with whom he had a strong intellectual friendship and who came to define Roberto Montanari \\"the painter of bulls and light,‚Äù outside the existing categories but within the great surface of expressive possibilities.‚Äù In the Eighties he continued his activity with several exhibitions and he met other painters, such as Franco Gentilini, Domenico Purificato, Pietro Annigoni and Ernesto Treccani and Roberto Sebasti√°n Matta. Some of them also participated in charities organized by Montanari himself to restore ancient monuments, to help earthquake victims, the poor, Chernobyl children etc. In 1981 Roberto Montanari suffered a brain tumor that was damaging his eyesight and he was operated and after several therapies he painted again and from 1982 to 1992 various monographies were published. On November 20th 1985 he was invited by Pope John Paul II to which he presented the painting \\"La Grande Via Crucis.‚Äù He traveled to the Vatican on May 7, 1986 with the American singer James Brown and his wife Adrienne Rodr√≠guez to deliver the oil \\"The Descent of Christ.‚Äù He returned a third time, on February 10th, 1988 and presented to the pope the work \\"Virgen de Macarena\\" with the bullfighter D√°maso Gonz√°lez. In 1990, the Verona City Council invited Montanari to represent Spain in the World Cup and the painter decided to present a series of work with the title \\"Spain to Verona\\" in which he inserted Spanish subjects into Veronese landscapes. In 2003 Montanari had a stroke that paralysed his eyes and on that occasion doctors said that he would not survive that but after several operations he rose again and started to paint again. In 2004 he was appointed president of the Critics Commission of the Veneto Region for the Academy \\"Antonio Canova\\" which he led for three years until 2007. In 2004, on the occasion of the ‚ÄúDell'Arte e del Lavoro\\" Award, Poste Italiane created a philatelic cancellation with a work by Roberto Montanari. In 2008 he was elected artistic director for the \\"Michelangelo Buonarroti Award‚Äù in Rome \\"for his remarkable artistic and cultural talent\\". On July 19th, 2017 Roberto Montanari was invited by the mayor of Vicenza at Palazzo Trissino for a tribute and on that occasion the painter donated to his adopted city the painting \\"El Toro en el Encierro\\" of 1997. = Other artistic activities = In the second half of the Seventies Montanari used drawings of his depicting \\"El encierro de San Fermin\\" and bulls to make costumes, such as scarves, T-shirts and dresses and also curtains. In addition, in the same period he drew the firm for a fashion house of the time: \\"Simon.‚Äù In the Eighties he painted crockery with the theme of the bull and made pure silk ties with drawings of Andalusian streets and flamenco dancers. In 1994 Roberto Montanari published the monograph \\"110 e lode‚Äù.. Profili di Roberto Montanari ‚ÄúThe Bulls Painter.‚Äù  Death and legacy  He lived between Spain and Italy until his death on August 10th, 2017, on the \\"Night of San Lorenzo.‚Äù It was an inexpiable death that even doctors didn't get an answer to. What is thought is that Roberto Montanari, at 80 years old, had \\"let\\" himself die because he felt unable to paint as he did once. In fact, painting was a necessity for him and he lived because his bulls lived. He used to say: ¬´I am like the bulls I paint, I always stand up to death.‚Äù In July 2018, after less than a year of his death, the City Council of Estepona decided to dedicate a citizen road to him. On March 16th, 2019, the Vicenza City Council organized a concert at Palazzo Chiericati in his memory with the title \\"A travel to Spain of painter Roberto Montanari\\" with a film about the life of the artist and some of his work exhibited alongside those of the Tiepolo. Roberto Montanari is buried in the monumental cemetery of Vicenza.

Howard Moore before the Chicago Vegetarian Society. It was reprinted several times by the society and other publishers. Background Moore, circa 1899 John Howard Moore, born in Missouri in 1862, was an American writer, zoologist, and science teacher, and a prominent member in the Chicago Vegetarian Society. Around 1886, Moore became a vegetarian for ethical reasons. He advocated for the ethical treatment of animals and authored several books, essays and pamphlets on the subject, as well as on the subjects of vegetarianism, evolutionary history, and humanitarianism. Carrica Le Favre, a well-known health lecturer, dress reformer, child-rearing expert, and physical culture advocate, founded the Chicago Vegetarian Society around 1890, which Moore joined shortly thereafter, while in attendance of Chicago University. Moore earned a baccalaureate degree from Chicago University in zoology. While at the university, Moore was one of the founders of the Vegetarian Eating Club, which he eventually became the lead and front of. Moore later wrote several well-regarded books, such as the 1906 work The Universal Kinship, the 1909 work The New Ethics, and the 1916 work Savage Survivals, among many other publications. =Addresses= Great Northern Hotel, 1900 Moore wrote the paper \\"Why I Am a Vegetarian\\" around the early part of 1895, which was primarily on the benefits of living on a vegetable diet, along with his opinions on the advances in the animal rights advocacy movement. He delivered an address with this paper, before the Chicago Vegetarian Society at the newly constructed Great Northern Hotel, on the northeast corner of Dearborn Street and Jackson Boulevard in Chicago, on March 3, 1895. Moore was persuaded to publish the paper, and it was printed shortly afterwards. The Chicago Vegetarian Society published the pamphlet Why I Am a Vegetarian, based on his speech, later that year. The preface is dated May 3, 1895. This publication was the first of Moore's. Another address, after the printing of the pamphlet, was delivered by Moore around June 1896, at the Philosophic Club, in Englewood, Chicago. The lecture was reported, in the monthly Food, Home and Garden newsletter, as being well received by those in attendance, with a discussion that followed afterwards. On the reading, Dr. Viola H. Ludden wrote that \\"the paper was broad and most excellent; full of scientific suggestion and humane thought.\\" Moore continued to give addresses on the subject of vegetarianism and animal rights with the Chicago Vegetarian Society for the following two decades, until his death in 1916. Publication Advertisement in the left column, appearing in issue 7, volume 6 of The Vegetarian Magazine The brochure Why I Am a Vegetarian, subtitled An Address Delivered before the Chicago Vegetarian Society, was published by the Purdy Publishing Company, in Chicago, Illinois, in 1895. At 5.5 x 18 centimeters, the 44-page pamphlet is described as \\"explaining that vegetable food is far better for humanity in a truly healthful sense, [with] the plea [...] for the human practice of the Golden Rule towards the animals which we [...] kill for food,\\" in an advertisement in the April 15, 1902 edition of The Vegetarian Magazine. It was also published in the same year as a 42-page pamphlet, by The Ward Waugh Publishing Company, at 5496 Ellis avenue, as well as in the periodical Good Health. It also appeared in the September 1897 issue of Chicago Vegetarian. An early edition of the publication was available for 10 cents. A 48-page third edition, printed in 1898, was sold for a cost of 25 cents per issue, or 5 copies for $1.00. It was advertised as having a fancy green cover, which was fastened with a silk cord, and as being \\"suitable for gifts.\\" The publisher was the Eastman Kodak Company. By 1899, the publication had made its seventh thousandth print and was being sold in crepe paper, still for a cost of 25 cents. Why I Am a Vegetarian is held at university and public libraries in the United States. A response to Moore's pamphlet, entitled Why I Am Not a Vegetarian: Why He is Wrong, was written by Danish-born American lawyer, lecturer, and political activist Laurence Gronlund. Moore later replied to Gronlund's writing, saying that for the carnivore, \\"every meal is a murder,\\" and that to \\"tell why one is 'not a vegetarian' is to give justification, or to attempt to give justification, for being a predatory animal.\\" Content Opening page in the 7th edition The Journal of the American Medicine Association notes that the \\"booklet is of interest,\\" by an author who is a \\"zo√∂philist vegetarian [who] uses no scientific arguments in favor of his thesis.\\" The preface for Why I Am a Vegetarian begins with an analogy of mankind's succeeding generations, in that \\"the human race is like a snake‚Äîit sheds. Ever and anon, as the ages bloom, old forms of thought are superseded by intellectual bran-news.\\" The following page, opposite the opening, are excerpts from several works, including the Irish novelist and poet Oliver Goldsmith's The Hermit, as well as an anonymous poem \\"What more advance can mortals make in sin?...\\" It also contains quotes from the British surgeon and polymath Sir Henry Thompson, the Scottish born geologist and natural scientist Richard Owen, and the Greek biographer and essayist Plutarch. He opens with writing, earnestly, that he \\"hope[s] in half a hundred minutes to rinse from your brains sand bars that have been ages in depositing,\\" in regards to a meat-eating diet. Moore then confounds that \\"human beings preach as the cardinal of morality that they should act upon others as they would be pleased to have others act upon them, and then take the most sensitive and beautiful beings all palpitating with life, and chop them into fragments with a composure that would do honor to the managers of an inferno.\\" Moore asserts that the meat-eating habits of English and American peoples exist because their forefathers were cannibals. Moore says that he is a vegetarian because he believes \\"that present-day ethics is founded on that puerile, pre-Darwinian delusion that all other kinds of creatures and all worlds were created explicitly for the hominine species. Vegetarianism is the ethical corollary of evolution [and] has taught us the kinship of all creatures.\\" His concluding paragraph begins with \\"Enjoy and let others enjoy. Live and let live. Do more. Live and help live. [...] Pity the grub and the ladybug, and have mercy on the mole. Poor, defenceless, undeveloped, untaught creatures. They are our fellow mortals.\\" The last page of the pamphlet contains an advertisement for twenty publications by Frances L. Dusenberry, at the McVicker's Building, in Chicago. Reception The journal Boston Ideas writes that the brochure is \\"one of the most eloquent treatises on the subject that we have read,\\" calling his language \\"vitally expressive [with] convincing sincerity.\\" It concludes with writing that \\"vegetarianism is the coming practice for the intelligent and sincere, and its inroads are already more rapid than is generally realized.\\" In their review of Why I Am a Vegetarian, the periodical The Public writes that it is \\"doubtless [to] question in some form [what] many persons who nevertheless go on eating what they do not hesitate to describe as 'corpses,'\\" noting that \\"we do kill men as well as animals; and, both having been killed, what difference is there between making food of one of the other?\\" It is described by The Vegetarian as being \\"worth the savings of a lifetime to every human being who desires to be honest [and] it should be got out in cheaper form, printed by the million, and [have] a copy placed in the hands of every human being who can read English and translated for the benefit of those who cannot.\\" The Pacific Health Journal writes that J. Howard Moore \\"portrays very vividly the relation which we as rational beings sustain to the whole animal creation, if we viewed it in a sensitive light, such as we would if we had never been educated to live upon flesh meats.\\" A review in Good Health says that it is a \\"little booklet which every meat eater ought to read [and] it is difficult to see how any person possessed of a really human soul can look a cow or a sheep in the face without blushing, after reading this book.\\" A quote from Moore's brochure, that \\"vegetarianism is the ethical corollary of evolution [and] is simply the expansion of ethics to suit the biological revelations of Charles Darwin\\" appears in Adam D. Shprintzen's 2013 work, The Vegetarian Crusade: The Rise of an American Reform Movement 1817-1921, at the beginning of the sixth chapter. In addition to several other citations, the pamphlet has also been made available in eBook format by several digital publishing companies. =Criticism= Review in the left column, in the Journal of the American Medical Association In a mixed review from the Journal of the American Medical Association, the reviewer writes that, as indicated in the pamphlet, vegetarianism is \\"being taken up with more vigor; its propaganda is more active than for some time past.\\" However, on Moore's intolerance to meat- eating, they note the terms \\"Christian cannibals\\" and \\"ghoulish clowns of science\\" as examples of his utterances towards \\"those who disagree with his dietetic opinions.\\" The New Church Life newsletter describes Moore's writings as \\"vigorous, [yet] his argument is not convincing to a Newchurchman, although [it] contains statements which, in the minds of some, awaken scruples as to eating things slain.\\" ReferencesCitationsSources=       External links *Why I Am a Vegetarian at Internet Archive  Category:1895 non-fiction books Category:Books about animal rights Category:Books about vegetarianism Category:English non-fiction books Category:Ethics books Category:Pamphlets Category:Vegetarian-related mass media ","title":"Why I Am a Vegetarian"},{"id":"64018612","text":"Salavdi Gugaev (–°–∞–ª–∞–≤–¥–∏ –ì—É–≥–∞–µ–≤; 1917‚Äì2010) was a Chechen-American who worked for the rehabilitation of Chechens and Ingush who were exiled to Central Asia in an act of ethnic cleansing. Salavadi was initially a Soviet soldier who was captured by the Wehrmacht during the Continuation War, he had to spend a prolonged period of time in a POW camp.  Life as an activist  After being released from the POW camp, Salavdi moved to the United States, where he began to periodically publish and appear on the air of the Voice of America and Radio Liberty stations, trying to draw the attention of the free world and heads of democratic states to the persecution for Stalin regime. The most significant contribution that Gugaev made to the rehabilitation of the peoples repressed in the USSR was his appeal to the United Nations on 1 July 1955, on the eve of the arrival of Nikita Khrushchev at the United Nations General Assembly. The document revealed the essence of the Stalinist actions (including the wholesale deportations of all ethnic Chechens and Ingush, Kalmyks, Balkars, and Karachays to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Siberia), citing facts, figures, and eyewitness accounts; an employee of the UN apparatus helped to deliver the message to the addressee.

For five years between 1992 and 1996 the event was not held. In 1997 the event was renewed as a three year old event and scheduled in February over the shorter distance of 7 furlongs and in 1998 the event received sponsorship from Budweiser which continued until 2007. In 1999 the event was moved to the turf track at a longer distance of one mile. In 2004 the conditions of the event were changed, in that four year olds and older could enter. The distance was extended to the now miles and the running was on the dirt track. In 2020 the event was upgraded to a Grade III event.

The line operates every 12-18 minutes during weekday peak hours, 25 minutes during weekday midday, 25-30 minutes during weeknights, and 20-30 minutes during the weekends. Route W4 trips are roughly 60 minutes long. Background Route W4 operates daily between Deanwood station and Anacostia station mostly operating between Northeast and Southeast. The line mostly runs along Division Avenue NE, Benning Road SE, Southern Avenue, and Alabama Avenue SE connecting multiple neighborhoods. Additional trips from Ballou High School are operated during school days in both directions. Select trips also end at Malcolm X Avenue & Newcomb Street SE, though passengers can remain on the bus as far as Malcolm X Avenue & South Capitol Street. Route W4 currently operates out of Southern Avenue and Shepherd Parkway divisions. During the weekday peak-hours, the line utilizes articulated buses due to its high ridership volume from Shepherd Parkway. Route W4 used to operate out of Bladensburg until Shepherd Parkway received articulated buses. History The line originally operated on portions of former streetcars lines before becoming taken over buses in the 1950s to 1960s. Route W4 originally operated under the Capital Traction Company under streetcars lines and later became a bus line on December 23, 1924. The line then was operated under DC Transit and then WMATA when it acquired DC Transit in 1973. Route W4 originally operated between Capital Plaza Mall in Landover Hills, Maryland and Bolling Air Force Base via Craftsman Circle and Prince George's Plaza Hospital. The line mostly operated along Division Avenue NE, Benning Road SE, Alabama Avenue SE, Kenilworth Avenue, and Baltimore‚ÄìWashington Parkway. Off peak service would terminate along Kenilworth Avenue. =1978 Changes= On December 3, 1978, route W4 was rerouted to Deanwood station via Minnesota Avenue in the middle of its route shortly after the Orange Line began service. The line would terminate at Deanwood station during the off peak-hours and would serve Capital Plaza during the weekday peak-hours only. =2001 Changes= On January 13, 2001, route W4 was rerouted along Alabama Avenue to serve the new Congress Heights station. Alternative service to 11th Place and Congress Street is available on the W2 and W3. =2003 Changes= Due to security concerns at Bolling Air Force Base, route W4 could not enter the base beginning on March 21, 2003. The route would have to be rerouted South Capitol Street between Firth Sterling Avenue and Malcolm X Avenue. Passengers will be able to alight at stops on South Capitol Street at the Navy‚Ä≤s Firth Sterling Gate, walk through the security checkpoint, and access an internal military shuttle bus which will follow the W9 routing around the base to reach destinations within Bolling Air Force Base and the Navy‚Ä≤s Anacostia Annex. On June 29, 2003, route W4 was rerouted from Bolling Air Force Base to Anacostia station as a result of the detour. =Proposed Changes= In 2011, WMATA proposed to eliminate route W4's routing between Deanwood station and Capital Plaza Mall. This was because route W4 was suffering from low ridership with large Portion of the Line in Maryland runs on Congested Roadways, impacting on-time performances with extended run times in Maryland that creates scheduling inflexibility in DC, where overwhelming majority of boardings occur. It was also proposed to improve the frequency of buses during all hours of the day. It was proposed to extend either routes F1, F2, or F13 from Prince George's Hospital to Deanwood station discontinuing service to Cheverly station. =2013 Changes= On March 24, 2013, W4 service between Deanwood station and Capital Plaza Mall via Craftsman Circle and Prince George's Hospital was discontinued due to low ridership and to improve on time performance. Alternative service was provided by routes A12, routes F1, F2, F8, F13, R11, R12, V7, V8, V14, and V15. There was no alternative service to Craftmans Circle however. =2020 Proposed Changes= In 2019 as part of WMATA's FY2021 budget, it was proposed to reroute the W4 to Fort Drum and D.C. Village in order to discontinue the A4 and W5, Service to Anacostia station would be discontinued with alternative service will be provided on routes A2, A6, A7, A8, A9, and W2. Fort Drum and DC Village residents would lose direct service to Anacostia station if the proposal goes through. However WMATA later backed out the proposal on March 31, 2020. Incidents * On October 20, 2011, 22 year old Demetrius Thompson was shot in the face by two men onboard a W4 bus near the intersection of 24th Street and Alabama Avenue SE.

She was the wife of Maharana Lakha Singh and mother to his heir, Mokal. Born as a Rathore princess of Mandore, she brought peace between her clan and that of her husband, the Sisodias, which lasted until the reign of her grandson, Rana Kumbha . She advised her son during the beginning of his reign, questioned the intentions of Mewari nobles, and is also believed to have educated Rana Kumbha.  Early life and marriage  Hansa Bai, born Hansa Kumari, was the daughter of Chunda Rathore of Mandore and Rani Suram Sankhali. As a daughter of the king, she lived in the palace's harem (Rani Mahal) with her mother. Hansa learned how a woman could rule effectively by watching her stepmother, Sona Mohil. Sona influenced Hansa's father to appoint Sona's son, Kanha, as his successor, instead of his son, Ranmal. In response, Ranmal left Mandore in self-imposed exile. She was first betrothed to the elder son of Maharana Lakha Singh of Mewar, Prince Chunda Sisodia. However, when the delegation from Mandore had arrived in Chittor to officialize the betrothal, Chunda was away from court. Lakha waited with the delegation until the prince returned. The aging leader of Chittor said the proposal was not meant for a \\"greybeard\\" like him and turned them down jokingly. When Prince Chunda later learned of the comment, the prince refused the marriage, for he could not accept a proposal which his father had publicly declined, however offhanded. The Maharana failed to change his son's mind, and, rather than offend Hansa's powerful family, was forced to marry the princess himself. In return, Chunda gave up his right to inheritance to the eldest son born by Hansa Bai.  After Marriage  As Rani of Mewar = Hansa Bai married Lakha Singh around either 1408 or 1407 and later gave birth to her son Mokal in 1409. She taught him as he grew and introduced him to his father's building plans, which would have a huge impact on him later in life. She also taught him of his lineage, his kingdom, and the Sisodia Hindu traditions, such as the God Eklinji, the many honor traditions such as robes of honor (which her brother used to kill another of Lakha's sons Raghedev) and the many other traditions such as Jahar, Saka and how to perform puja. In this way, she prepared him to be king. = As Queen Mother = Mokal and Hansa the top of her head shown far right In 1421 Lakha Singh, Hansa's husband died in the war, leaving young Mokal as his successor. Being a minor, Hansa's former betrothed Chunda began to look after the state of affairs, as promised to Rana Lakha. But Hansa Bai disapproved of the influence that Chunda had over the nobles of Mewar. She questioned his integrity and doubted his intentions. Her resentment made Chunda leave Chittor and retire to Mandu, capital of Malwa. Rani Hansa Bai obtained help from her brother Ranmal to administer the state of affairs on behalf of Mokal until he became older. He fulfilled this role admirably over the following years, launching military campaigns against Mewar's rivals. These include Firuz Khan of Nagaur, Ahmad Shah I of Gujarat and the Hadas of Bundi. However, there was resentment among the nobles of Mewar at the growing Rathore influence at court, in particular regarding the level of nepotism with which Ranmal awarded high positions. During this time Hansa also arranged Mokal's marriage to Sobhagya Devi. Though the couple was young, they conceived quickly and had Prince Kumbha. Maharana Mokal had a brief stint as the ruler of Mewar but rose to fame as the most celebrated warrior of his race. He defeated Nagpur, Gujarat, and repelled an invasion by the Delhi Sultanate (Sayyid dynasty). But most importantly, he completed palaces that were commenced by his father, Maharana Lakha, and conspired to build more aesthetic structures. During this time, Hansa's father Chunda was killed in battle in 1423 and was succeeded, as the latter had planned, by his younger son Kanha. However, in 1428, Kanha too died and was followed by another son of Chunda, who also had a short reign. Seeing an opportunity, Ranmal marched on the capital city, Mandore, at the head of a Mewari army and seized the throne, becoming the new Rao of Marwar. As a Rao, his influence grew and the more power he had the more people resented him, such as Lakha's other son Raghedev. With more power, Ranmal began capturing land and while capturing land he made reforms, like introducing systems of weights and measures which Hansa and the other Mewar nobles agreed with. = As Queen Grandmother = In 1433, Mokal was assassinated by his paternal uncles, Chacha and Mera, which brought an end to the great Maharana in the making at the young age of 24. Lack of support, however, caused Chacha and Mera to flee thus once more leaving a small child as ruler of Mewar, now in the person of Mokal's son Kumbha. Hansa Bai, now the queen-grandmother again called on her brother Ranmal to take charge of the state and become regent until the new Rana reached an older age. Ranmal accompanied by some of his twenty-four sons, returned to Chittor, nominally taking up the position of caretaker to his minor great-nephew though, for all intents and purposes, he became the true power in the kingdom. The new regent's first action was to strike the allies of Mewar's rival kingdoms of Gujarat and Malwa, the latter of which having sheltered Mokal's killers. The rulers of Bundi, Abu, Bhoola and Basantgarh were crushed and the Sultan of Malwa, Mahmud Khalji, was defeated in the Battle of Sarangpur in 1437. He and Hansa also began to hunt down the conspirators, with some being killed and others being forced into hiding. One of them, Mokal's paternal uncle Chacha, had his daughter Bharmali taken captive and married by Ranmal. 500 other girls belonging to the families of the fugitives were captured and given out by Ranmal to his favorites. One of Mokal's brothers, Raghavdev, objected to this action and took the women into his protection. He began to grow apprehensive of the growing Rathore influence in the court and started preparing a resistance to Ranmal. Conversely, Ranmal also viewed the Mewari prince as a threat and too launched a conspiracy. Events came to a head when Ranmal invited Raghadev to present him with a traditional robe of honor. However, unknown to the latter, the sleeves of the robe had been sown in such a way to restrict his movement. Raghadev was then ambushed oby Ranmal's men, who immediately cut down the helpless prince. Hansa was outraged and did not support her brother killing Raghavdev and the captivity of the women and this may be what influenced the young Kumbha to kill Ranmal as he was drunk and tied to his bed. During this time Ranmal's son Jodha escaped from Mewar and it is possible that Hansa helped him, not wanting her homeland of Mandore to be without a king. As King Kumbha regularly prayed to the god Eklingji he was likely taught by Hansa to do so. = Death = The accurate date of Hansa's death is unknown and it is possible that she wasn't alive to see the assassination of her brother and died shortly after the reign of her grandson began and that is why the nobles waited to assassinate Ranmal, not wanting to displease the Queen Grandmother. Her descendants were kings of Mewar and the peace between the Rathores and Sisodias was broken after her death and chaos resumed for decades.

Life and research  Mary Florence Curtis was the oldest of five children born to Jennie Esther (Lucas) (1857‚Äì1945) and Frank Abbott Curtis (1857‚Äì1937) in Westminster, Massachusetts. She attended Fitchburg High School in Massachusetts and in 1902 she began her undergraduate studies at Wellesley College. She was a Wellesley Honors Scholar throughout her college years and received her Bachelor of Art's degree in 1906. As was common practice at that time, Mary Curtis took a teaching position at Leominster High School in Westminster, where she taught German, algebra and geometry for two years, traveling to Europe for the summer of 1907. After her return, from 1908 to 1910, she taught German and natural science at the Cushing Academy in Ashburnham, Massachusetts. (During the summer break of 1909, she studied botany and pedagogy at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.) Returning to Germany, Curtis studied mathematics and science for three semesters (May 1910 until August 1911) at Leipzig University. Upon her return from Leipzig, she joined the Wellesley College mathematics faculty where she taught from September 1911 to June 1914. Even while she was on the Wellesley faculty, she started graduate school at nearby Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Mass. in September 1913 and was awarded a one- year Mary E. Horton fellowship to facilitate her schooling. Curtis earned her M.A. in 1915 and her Ph.D. in 1917 with a dissertation in differential geometry titled Curves invariant under point transformations of special type. Professors Charles Leonard Bouton and Julian Coolidge were her faculty reviewers. She was the first woman from Harvard-Radcliffe (the two are now combined) to earn a doctorate in math. = Professor = From 1917 to 1918, Dr. Mary Curtis taught at the College for Women at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, From 1918 to 1920 she was an instructor and then until 1921 assistant professor at Wellesley College. In the summer of 1920 she returned to Leipzig, Germany. Mary's mathematical research did not go unnoticed. According to mathematician Judy Green: > \\"In a November 1920 letter extracted in the Bulletin of the AMS, the Italian > geometer and historian of mathematics Gino Loria wrote to the American > historian of mathematics D. E. Smith that 'Mary F. Curtis had established > [a] remarkable result, that every rectifiable skew parabola is a helix‚Äù (27 > (1921): 201). The extract from Loria‚Äôs letter referred to Curtis‚Äôs 1918 > paper On the rectifiability of a twisted cubic and motivated her 1921 paper > On skew parabolas.‚Äù It was in Wellesley, on June 10, 1921, at the age of 37, that she married another mathematician William Caspar Graustein (1888-1941), who was born in Cambridge and teaching at Harvard when he met Curtis, one of his students. After their marriage and her subsequent name change, Mary Graustein took an academic leave of absence for two years before returning to teach at Wellesley College as assistant professor. There, from 1923 to 1929, she taught as an assistant professor. From 1926 to 1941, she and her friend and fellow mathematician Rachel Blodgett Adams, Ph.D., worked as tutors at Radcliffe College, work that she enjoyed, as quoted by Green. > ‚ÄúMy tutorial work at Radcliffe consists of eleven ‚Äòtutees.‚Äô I see each of > them for an hour every other week.

A pair of C-130Es similar to the stolen aircraft Background Sergeant Paul Meyer was an aircraft mechanic in the United States Air Force. At the age of 23 he was already a Vietnam veteran. He had married earlier that year and was close to his wife and stepchildren. He had suffered flashbacks and was homesick and unhappy. He also was drinking heavily. A few days before the theft he'd requested to be transferred from Mildenhall to Langley Air Force Base but the request was turned down. Night of theft On the night of 22 May 1969 he was at a military colleague's house party where he drank heavily and began to behave erratically and aggressively. His friends tried to persuade him to go to bed but he escaped through a window. Shortly after, Suffolk Police found him on the A11 and he was arrested for being drunk and disorderly. He was escorted back to his barracks and told to sleep it off. Instead of obeying orders he assumed the alias \\"Captain Epstein\\", went to a hangar where a Lockheed C-130E Hercules serial no. 63-7789 was and ordered it to be prepared. He had worked on it so knew the protocols to access it and had a working knowledge of how to fly it. The stolen aircraft took off at 05:08. =Call to wife= During the flight he was able to make a phone call to his then wife, Jane Meyer (now Mary Ann Jane Goodson) which lasted for more than an hour. The last twenty minutes of their conversation was recorded. At one point the voice of Colonel Kingery from Mildenhall interrupts. Around 06:55 radar contact was lost with Meyer's aircraft and an hour and forty-five minutes after takeoff the C-130 crashed into the English Channel. A few days later small parts from the missing C-130, including a life raft, washed up near the Channel Island of Alderney. =Accident report= The accident report records that only two aircraft were dispatched to find Meyer, a C-130 from RAF Mildenhall and an F-100 from RAF Lakenheath. Neither aircraft established visual or radio contact. French Air force fighters were scrambled. =Allegations C-130 was shot down= Peter Nash was a senior aircraftman at RAF Wattisham with 29 Squadron. It was an airbase with a Quick Reaction Alert squadron. According to Nash, he was involved with preparing three English Electric Lightnings. Two of them took off, loaded with missiles. In his 2011 book Lightning Boys Rick Groombridge claims that an American exchange pilot took over his aircraft at Wattisham and returned to base minus one missile. Groombridge declined to be interviewed by the BBC but stands by his story. Nash disputes this account - he was chief armourer and says both aircraft returned to base with all four missiles unused. Nash says that a few weeks after the event he went on a course and met another armourer from RAF Chivenor. Nash says he was told that at least one Hawker Hunter was scrambled. The other armourer also claimed that the pilot in question returned to base minus missiles, that the pilot was met by RAF police for a secret debrief along with his plane's camera gun. Nash himself keeps an open mind but says it would be within the capabilities of the Hawker Hunter to have intercepted the missing aircraft. The scope for this claim must be viewed with some scepticism as RAF Hunters were never fitted for, nor ever carried air to air missiles. Some marks did carry air to ground rockets, and most types had 4 30mm cannons. Rediscovery of wreck The wreck was rediscovered in 2018.

She created an extensive West Coast abortion network in the United States, which catered to a range of clients in the early 20th century. It is estimated that her clinic provided about 50,000 abortions in San Francisco and about 150,000 abortions total. In her lifetime, Burns was widely covered in the press, due to her socially unconventional lifestyle, legal troubles, and occupation as an abortionist in the pre-Roe v. Wade era.  Early life  On September 5, 1886, Inez Brown Burns (n√©e Ingenthron) was born. The accounts of her birthplace vary, with some sources claiming that she was born in a two-bedroom cardboard shack in the outskirts of Philadelphia, while others say that she was born in San Francisco. According to her biographer, Burns was truly born in a tenement building in the South of Market district of San Francisco. The Philadelphia story was merely a legend told by Burns. At the time, the South of Market neighborhood was comparable to Hell's Kitchen in New York City, due to its gritty warehouses, street gangs, and cramped living spaces. Her parents were Alice Bell Cross, an American, and Fredrick Ingenthron (b. 1853), a poor German immigrant. Her father, originally from Traunstein, was a cigar maker and an alcoholic. The couple had met in Indiana and lived in Chicago before moving to San Francisco. In 1894, Frederick died, leaving Alice to raise four children as a single parent. Burns had a difficult childhood, and she was forced to leave school at 5 years old in order to work at a pickle factory. Burns taught herself to read, due to her lack of formal schooling.  Early work  As a teenager, Burns found a job as a manicurist at the Palace Hotel. She was admired by many male guests of the hotel, who often sought her services, including Eugene West, a full-time abortionist. At the time, West was a \\"lady's man,\\" according to historians, and three times the age of Burns. He and Burns became lovers, and he reportedly performed some abortions on her. He eventually offered her a job at his abortion clinic, and she worked by his side for years. In early 20th century, there were strict birth control laws in the United States, resulting in many unintended pregnancies. Furthermore, abortion was illegal, and it was a felony to provide abortion services. In 1872, San Francisco had even adopted an anti-abortion statute. However, a large underground economy of abortion providers existed, which was primarily marketed through word-of-mouth. The doctors, midwives, and specialists who performed underground abortions were rarely arrested, unless the pregnant person died during the procedure. As a result, underground abortion services were fairly common at the time. At that time, many abortion providers were undertrained, under-equipped, or worked in unhygienic conditions. This led to many abortion-related injuries and deaths.Similarly, West was not without scandal. In 1902, he was charged with dismemberment, after he had thrown the body of a dead patient into the San Francisco Bay. He claimed that he had tried to save the patient from a botched abortion performed by another doctor, and he had been unsuccessful. Furthermore, West had other court appearances, due to malpractice. As written by Riggins, his \\"incompetence and malpractice routinely kept him in the courtroom.\\" Following her affair with West, Burns began a relationship with George Washington Merritt, a 42-year old businessman. She became pregnant with a child, while seeing Merritt. It was considered unpleasant and uncomfortable for a pregnant woman to work at an abortion clinic, so Burns then left her job. Before she left, she stole a satchel of medical equipment, as well as bottles of chloroform and quinine, which she took home with her. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake radically altered the city, as many people lost their professions, homes, or loved ones. During the earthquake, Burns quickly ran out of her apartment, grabbing the medical equipment that she had stolen from West's office. Her home had been destroyed in the earthquake, and she found herself among the homeless who camped out in Golden Gate Park. However, in this environment, Burns found a business opportunity. She began to perform abortions for other campers in the park in Sharon Meadow, and news of her talents soon spread. Following the devastation of the earthquake, Burns briefly left San Francisco for Pittsburgh. In 1910, she returned to San Francisco on the Southern Pacific Railroad for a new life. By that point, she was mother with two sons, Bobby and George, but she only returned with one of her children (Bobby). When her sister, Nellie, asked about George, Inez said, \\"I‚Äôll send for George later,\\" although she apparently never did. The boy remained with his father, George Merritt, in Pennsylvania.  Abortion clinic  In San Francisco, Burns quickly became known as a skilled abortion provider. In 1922, she opened her first abortion clinic in a 2-story building, located at 327 Fillmore Street. The clinic had multiple people on staff, including nurses, a blood technician, and a janitor. It was designed to feel pleasant and inviting, with Persian carpets, Chippendale chairs, oil paintings, and crystal chandeliers. The reception room had Burns' business cards in a copper bowl, where she was described as only a \\"Designer.\\" The clinic had one operating room, which included surgical devices, a bowl, and a basin. Other rooms had beds for recovering patients. The backyard had large, concrete incinerators, where the staff would burn the fetal remains. Perhaps due to the prior scandals of West, Burns was particularly concerned with health and hygiene. The operating instruments at the clinic were always sterilized and she employed trained anesthetics. When patients left the clinic, they were given detailed instructions for aftercare. If they experienced any complications, the clinic would cover any related costs. Consequently, the clinic had very few problems related to malpractice of complications. The clinic had various arrangements to address the illegal nature of the work. Trapdoors were installed, in case of police raids, and the clinic paid kickbacks to the San Francisco Police Department (reportedly $400/day by the 1940s), which enabled the clinic to stay open. Burns made sure to have a minimal paper trail. She did not keep detailed records of her appointments, and she carefully stored her money in various safes and compartments rather than in a bank. The clinic was considered clean, efficient, and discreet, and business quickly grew. An average of 20-30 women were serviced per day, and they paid between $75 and $200 per abortion. The clients were both wealthy and poor, but Burns barely provided discounts, as she was primarily interested in the financial aspects of the business (rather than political or philosophical reasons). Clients of the clinic included housewives, celebrities, and athletes, and it was common for women to be waiting when Burns opened the doors in the morning. The majority of her clients were married, middle-class and wealthy women, and some did not tell their husbands that they were pregnant and/or that they had sought out abortion services. Hollywood studios sent contract actresses to her clinic, and the Olympic skater Sonja Henie reportedly visited her clinic. The clinic network eventually spanned the West Coast, with services extending from Seattle to San Diego. At her peak, Burns was making at least $50,000 per month through the clinic. By 1924, Burns was able to purchase a home at 274 Guerrero Street, where she stored much of her cash. That year, she married Charles A. Granelli, a stylish and handsome Italian playboy. Over time, she acquired a range of properties, including a house in Atherton and a 800 acre ranch (known as \\"Burns Ranch\\") in La Honda, amidst the Santa Cruz Mountains. Burns drove around in a chauffeured limousine. She hosted famously raucous parties on Wednesday nights, especially at Burns Ranch, which attracted politicians, prostitutes, policemen, and health care professionals. Some attendants of her parties included Pinky Lee, Dwight Fiske, Burl Ives, and a magician named Gali-Gali. During this period, she became a source of social fascination in gossip headlines, particularly due to her flamboyant lifestyle. She eventually left Granelli. In 1932, she married Joseph Burns, a California Assemblyman, who she met at one of her parties. She took his last name. In 1945, Burns claimed that she made about 1 million dollars per year, but about half of that money went to kickbacks and bribes.  Raids and legal issues  The abortion clinic suffered many police raids during its existence. The first raid was in 1936, when police stormed the Fillmore Street location and arrested a maid and a janitor, whom they called \\"vagrants.\\" However, the clinic was not shut down and Inez was not arrested. Two years later, in 1938, the clinic was raided again, when a patient had informed the police that Inez had performed an abortion. The police questioned 10 women in the waiting room, and they arrested Burns and Margie Silver, a nurse. A few weeks later, Burns and Silver were released when the police were unable to acquire formal complaints from the clinic's clients. It was repeatedly difficult for the police to find formal evidence and charges for the clinic, as most women did not want to share that they had received an abortion. In 1939, Burns was charged with tax evasion. She settled it in 1940 by paying a $10,000 fine. In the following decade, Burns faced some of her greatest legal challenges, when Pat Brown became District Attorney in 1943. He had run a campaign to rid the city of vice and police corruption. A few years later, on September 23, 1945, a young woman had visited San Francisco's Central Emergency Hospital, requesting treatment after a recent abortion. The woman was questioned and it was determined that she had received an abortion at the Fillmore Street clinic. The next day, two undercover police officers were instructed to watch over the location. They found no incriminating evidence or activity, but a police raid was still conducted on September 26th at 9:40am. By the time the police arrived, Burns had fled the flat with her husband, another women, and various documents in a bag. They had driven away in a limousine. With this news, Police Inspector Frank Ahern drove to Inez's home on Guerrero Street, where he discovered $289,217 in cash, and a piece of paper (that Burns reportedly tried to first swallow) that detailed her revenues. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was notified and Burns was immediately arrested. Following the arrest of Burns, the police and legal forced clamped down on the clinic. Yet another raid was conducted, where police found notebooks with extensive financial records. They learned that the clinic had performed about $500,000 worth of abortions in 1944. Then, Burns and seven clinic employees were charged with conspiracy to commit abortion and violation of state medical laws. Burns pled not guilty before a grand jury. The jury members could not agree on her guilt, despite a large amount of evidence supplied by the prosecution. On Sep. 26, 1946, Burns was convicted of performing illegal abortions. She served two years and seven months at Tehachapi Women's Prison. She later had convictions for tax evasion and served additional prison sentences. In total, Burns paid about $800,000 in back taxes.  Death  Inez spent the final years of her life with her husband, Joe, at a nursing home in Moss Beach, California. She died on January 25, 1976 at 87 years old, and a few years after the Supreme Court legalized abortion in Roe v. Wade (1973). Although she was very wealthy as a middle-aged woman, she was destitute in her old age, most likely due to the multiple tax evasion charges brought against her.

It was an influential and widely used tract. It places the \\"land of Jerusalem\\" (terra ierosolimitana) at the centre of the world and describes it in detail. It lists its neighbours, the various Christian denominations living in it and the different European groups. It describes the special status of the Pisan, Genoese and Venetian communities within the kingdom. It contains a short description of the Hospitallers, a lengthy description of the Templars and a detailed description of the Latin ecclesiastical structure of the kingdom. The Christian holy places are listed in the sequence in which they appear in the ministry of Jesus. The names of the kingdom's main cities at different times are listed. The physical geography, fauna and fruit-bearing trees of the kingdom are given. At the end of the treatise, the feudal structure of the kingdom is detailed, including the king's coronation oath and the service that the barons of the kingdom owe. The most important barons and the number of knights they were required to supply are given. The Principality of Antioch and the County of Tripoli are described as beyond the kingdom's borders, but its vassals nevertheless. Finally, the non-Christian inhabitants of the kingdom are noted. In content and structure, the Tractatus is utterly unlike contemporary pilgrimage accounts. The date of the text is disputed. Hans Eberhard Mayer dated it no more precisely than to the late 12th century, without stating his reasons. Its most recent editor, Benjamin Kedar, dates it on internal grounds to between 1168 and 1187. He rejects its reference to the coronation of King Leo I of Armenia in 1198 as a later addition to the text. Paolo Trovato, on the other hand, dates it to after 1198 on philological grounds.

Early life Willis Garner \\"Sec\\" Taylor was born in Wichita, Kansas on January 20, 1887. He originally signed his name W. Garner Taylor, but he feared that it sounded pretentious.Congressional Record, March 9, 1965, p. 4523 Accordingly, he went by the name Garner W. Taylor throughout his career. His readers and friends called him \\"Sec\\" Taylor, which was the name most associated with him. A lifelong sports fan, he played quarterback on his high school football team.\\"Garner W. Taylor, Sports Editor, 78: Writer with the Des Moines Register 50 Years Dies\\" New York Times, Feb. 27, 1965, p. 25 He also played high school baseball and basketball, and later played semi-professional basketball. Sports Writing Career Taylor began his career as a sportswriter in his hometown of Wichita, Kansas. He got his start with the Wichita Beacon in 1905.\\"Death Halts Typewriter of 'Sec' Taylor,\\" Chicago Tribune, Feb. 27, 1965, p. A4 He was paid $5 per week. Twice he gave up his job at the Beacon to attend college, but each time he returned to journalism after just a few weeks in school. He later worked for the Wichita Eagle, the St. Joseph Gazette, and the Chicago Blade. While he lived in St. Joseph, Missouri, he worked as a secretary for a local baseball team, during which he acquired the nickname \\"Sec.\\" In 1914 he moved to Des Moines, Iowa to become the sports editor of the Des Moines Register. He would work for the Register for the next 51 years. John Cowles, Sr. persuaded Taylor to start a regular sports column for the Register. Taylor's column was titled \\"Sittin' In with the Athletes,\\" and it eventually became one of the most popular sports columns in the country. When Taylor entered the newspaper business, most sports writers served as little more than public relations officials for local boxing promoters and sports team owners. Taylor saw his job differently. He brought to his column a focus on objectivity and a commitment to reporting facts. Along with the famous sports writer Grantland Rice of the New York Tribune, Sec Taylor helped usher in a new era of independent-minded, fact-based sports writing. Other writers that followed in the same tradition included Red Smith, Halsey Hall, W.C. Heinz, and Shirley Povich. Taylor covered more than 40 World Series during his sports writing career.Nancy Clark, \\"Sec Taylor's Baseball Legacy,\\" Des Moines Register, p. C1 A highly talented reporter, he nevertheless missed one of the biggest baseball stories ever. Taylor got a tip that the Chicago White Sox planned to fix the 1919 World Series, but he failed to follow up on it, a decision that he always regretted. Baseball remained his favorite sport throughout his life. Although he was not based in a city with a Major League team, he covered Major League baseball games across the country on behalf of the Des Moines Register. Taylor routinely traveled by train with the teams, which enabled him to get to know executives, managers, and players throughout Major League baseball. He became so well-known that E.R. \\"Salty\\" Saltwell, a Chicago Cubs executive, expressed amazement at how often he was asked by players and team officials, \\"Hey, do you know Sec Taylor? How's Sec?\\" Taylor wrote about a wide range of sports besides baseball. In a national poll of sportswriters, he correctly predicted that Joe Louis would defeat James Braddock in their 1937 world heavyweight championship bout at Comiskey Park.\\"Poll of Sports Writers Picks Louis to Take the Title,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, June 20, 1937, p. B4 Taylor co-founded the Football Writers Association of America in 1941. He also served as its president. In 1957 Taylor received the Grantland Rice Memorial Award for excellence in sports writing.\\"Sports Editor Honored: Taylor of Des Moines Gets Grantland Rice Award,\\" New York Times, Nov. 2, 1957, p. 16 In addition to his sports writing duties, Sec Taylor served as a Director of the Des Moines Register and Tribune Company. As Kenneth MacDonald, the Register's long-time editor and publisher, observed: \\"Sec's reputation for integrity was unquestioned.\\" Officiating Career Sports writing was Taylor's principal career, but he also worked as an official for college basketball and football games. Renowned for his objectivity and fairness, he officiated games in the Big Ten Conference, the Missouri Valley Conference, the Big Six Conference, and the Big Seven Conference. After officiating games, he often wrote the stories on them for the next day's edition of the Register. He also refereed boxing and wrestling matches in Iowa and Missouri. Taylor served as the Field Judge for the 1940 Chicago Charities College All-Star Game at Soldier Field between the NFL champion Green Bay Packers and an all-star team of college football players.\\"Starting Lineups,\\" Chicago Tribune, Aug. 29, 1940, p. 21 At a time of racial segregation, the 1940 All Star game was notable because it was racially integrated, and included UCLA star tailback Kenny Washington. Besides officiating games, Taylor also served as a consultant to the Big Ten and the Pacific Coast conferences.Wilfrid Smith, \\"Big Ten, Pacific Chiefs Indorse A.C.E. Proposals,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, April 30, 1952, p. B3 Minor League Baseball in Des Moines Taylor played a leading role in minor league baseball's long history in Des Moines. Professional baseball had deep roots in the city, dating back to teams like the Des Moines Prohibitionists, who played in the Western Association in the 1880s and 1890s. When Sec Taylor arrived in 1914, the Des Moines Boosters were a fixture of the Western League. In 1925 the Des Moines Demons became the city's baseball club in the Western League. On May 2, 1930, the Demons made history when they hosted one of the first night games played under permanent lights in professional baseball history.http://www.milb.com/content/page.jsp?ymd=20060206&content;_id=41085806&sid;=t451&vkey;=team1 General Electric provided the artificial lights on stanchions placed around Holcomb Park, the team's home field, which was located on the city's north side at the intersection of Holcomb Avenue and 6th Avenue. Over 12,000 people attended the first game played under the lights, and NBC Radio broadcast the game live from Holcomb Park. Sec Taylor covered the game. The next day in the Register, he wrote, \\"Baseball was played successfully after dark on an illuminated field and the Demons won 13-6 in a contest that was normal in every respect so far as the playing was concerned.\\" But in 1937 the city lost its minor league baseball club when the Des Moines Demons folded as a result of the Western League's collapse. To attract a new team, Taylor spent years campaigning on behalf of the construction of a new ballpark, which culminated in the opening of Pioneer Memorial Stadium in 1947. Crucially, he also helped persuade the Chicago Cubs to take on the Des Moines Bruins as their minor league affiliate in the newly re-established Western League. The Bruins played at Pioneer Memorial Stadium from 1947 to 1958. In 1959 a revived version of the Des Moines Demons replaced the Bruins as the city's minor league franchise. The Demons served as the Philadelphia Phillies farm club in the Three-I League. By order of the Des Moines City Council, Pioneer Memorial Stadium was renamed \\"Sec Taylor Stadium\\" on September 1, 1959. Representatives of many Major League Baseball teams attended the naming ceremony, as well as the boxing champion Jack Dempsey. A long-time friend of Taylor, Dempsey said, \\"I'd have gone anywhere in the world to pay tribute to Sec. He's one of the grandest men that ever lived. He always said the right thing -the truth.\\" When told that the stadium would be renamed in his honor, Taylor said, \\"It is the greatest thing that has come to me in my life. I don't feel I'm deserving but being human, I like it.\\" Death Sec Taylor died of a heart attack in his hotel room in Miami, Florida on February 26, 1965, while covering Major League Baseball's spring training.Congressional Record, March 9, 1965, pp. 4522-23 He was 78 years old. Maury White, Taylor's colleague at the Des Moines Register, observed after Taylor's death: \\"At 78, many men have outlived most of their friends. 'Sec' never stopped making new friends.\\" Reverend James W. Lenhart of Plymouth Congregational Church presided at the funeral service. Family and Legacy Sec Taylor and his wife, Hazel, had two sons: Rex and Garner Jr. The minor league stadium in Des Moines is now home to the Iowa Cubs, the AAA club of the Chicago Cubs. Although the stadium was renamed Principal Park in 2004, the playing field is still named Sec Taylor Field.Annie Shuppy, \\"Sec Taylor Becomes Principal Park,\\" Des Moines Register, Aug. 6, 2004, p. B3 Besides the Iowa Cubs, Sec Taylor Field also hosts the Iowa State High School Baseball Tournament.

It was planned that it would attempt a mission to Africa but it was destroyed and its sister ship LZ 104 (L 59), nicknamed Das Afrika-Schiff (\\"The Africa Ship\\"), made a famous attempt at a long-distance resupply mission to the beleaguered garrison of Germany's East Africa colony. Modifications LZ 102 (L 57) in 1917 The Imperial German Naval office in hopes of outfitting a ship that could fly to Africa had LZ 102 cut in half and added two more segments - in length. The gas in these extra two segments increased the Airship's gas volume by . This additional volume was more than then entire volume of early Zeppelin LZ 3. It was designed to reach an altitude of about . History The first flight of the new airship took place on 26 September 1917 at the Friedrichshafen base. = Destruction = The flight to Africa would only be in one direction; the airship would not be able to return to Germany due to losses of the hydrogen lifting gas during the flight. The Imperial German Naval command selected the relatively inexperienced Korvettenkapit√§n (\\"lieutenant-commander\\") Ludwig Bockholt as they did not want to lose an experienced commander. According to Bockholt, LZ 102 (L 57) was difficult to control and had insufficient engine power but it was decided that despite this it would be sent on the Africa mission. After two additional test flights, the L.57 flew to the base in J√ºterbog where cargo intended for Africa was loaded on its deck, including 85 boxes with various types of medical supplies. Loading was completed at noon on 6 October. During previous flights, no tests had been carried out with full engine power and it was only after loading the cargo that Bockholt decided to carry out tests the same evening. Despite the rising wind, Bockholt ordered the airship to be removed from the hangar, which almost always ended in disaster due to strong gusts of wind. Bockholt decided to wait out the impending storm in the air, but he delayed the start waiting for food and warm clothes to be delivered aboard the airship. Just before midnight, a strong gust of wind hit the airship, damaging it. About 40 minutes after midnight, the wind decreased sufficiently that it was decided that it would be possible to place the airship back into the hangar. However, just in front of the hangar door, the airship suddenly rose into the air and a strong gust of wind began to pull it across the field despite efforts of the ground handlers. Bockholt released gas from the airship's gas chambers and ordered the soldiers to shoot holes in some of the chambers to speed up the dumping of the gas. Despite all efforts, the wind took again the damaged blimp, which caught fire about two o'clock. Loaded with fuel and ammunition, the fire burned until the morning and the valuable medical supplies burned onboard the aircraft.

The aMRI method takes high temporal-resolution MRI data as input, applies a spatial decomposition, followed by temporal filtering and frequency-selective amplification of the MRI frames before synthesizing a motion-amplified MRI data set. This approach can reveal deformations of the brain parenchyma and displacements of arteries due to cardiac pulsatility and CSF flow. aMRI has thus far been demonstrated to amplify motion in brain tissue to a more visible scale, however, can in theory be applied to visualize motion induced by other endogenous or exogenous sources in other tissues. aMRI uses video magnificent processing methods such which uses Eulerian Video Magnification and phase- based motion processing, with the latter thought to be less prone to noise and less sensitive to non-motion induced voxel intensity changes. Both video- processing methods use a series of mathematical operations used in image processing known as steerable-pyramid wavelet transformation to amplify motion without the accompanying noise.

The battery was formed when Captain John C. Landis recruited men from the Missouri State Guard in late 1861 and early 1862. The battery fielded two 12-pounder Napoleon field guns and two 24-pounder howitzers for much of its existence, and had a highest reported numerical strength of 62 men. After initially serving in the Trans- Mississippi Theater, where it may have fought in the Battle of Pea Ridge, the unit was transferred east of the Mississippi River. The battery saw limited action at the Battle of Iuka before providing artillery support for Confederate infantry assaults at the Second Battle of Corinth, both in 1862. In 1863, the unit was transferred to Grand Gulf, Mississippi, a key point on the Mississippi River. After Major General Ulysses S. Grant landed Union infantry at Bruinsburg, Landis's Battery formed part of Confederate defenses at the battles of Port Gibson in early May, after which Landis was promoted and Lieutenant John M. Langan took command. Later that month, it took part in the Battle of Champion Hill. On May 17, the battery was part of a Confederate force tasked with holding the crossing of the Big Black River at the Battle of Big Black River Bridge, where it may have suffered the capture of two cannons. Landis's Battery next saw action during the Siege of Vicksburg. While there, the battery helped repulse Union assaults on May 22. Landis's Battery was captured when the Confederate garrison of Vicksburg surrendered on July 4. Although the surviving men of the battery were exchanged, the battery was not reorganized after Vicksburg; instead, it was absorbed into Guibor's Missouri Battery along with Wade's Missouri Battery. Background In the United States during the early 19th century, a large cultural divide developed between the Northern States and the Southern States over the issue of slavery. By the time of the 1860 United States presidential election, slavery had become one of the defining features of southern culture, with the ideology of states' rights being used to defend the institution. Eventually, many southerners decided that secession was the only way to preserve slavery, especially after abolitionist Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860. His candidacy was regionally successful, as much of his support was from the Northern States; he received no electoral votes from the Deep South. Many southerners rejected the legitimacy of Lincoln's election, and promoted secession. On December 20, 1860, the state of South Carolina seceded, and the states of Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed suit in early 1861. On February 4, the seceding states formed the Confederate States of America; Jefferson Davis became the nascent state's president. 12-pounder Napoleon cannon, similar to those issued to the battery In Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, the military installation of Fort Sumter was still held by a Union Army garrison. On the morning of April 12, the Confederates fired on Fort Sumter, beginning the American Civil War. The fort surrendered the next day. Shortly after the attack, Lincoln requested that the states remaining in the Union provide 75,000 volunteers for the war effort. In the coming weeks, the states of Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas joined the Confederacy. A Union army commanded by Brigadier General Irvin McDowell moved south into Virginia and attacked two Confederate armies commanded by Brigadier Generals P. G. T. Beauregard and Joseph E. Johnston on July 21. In the ensuing First Battle of Bull Run, the Union army was routed. Meanwhile, the state of Missouri was politically divided. The state legislature voted against secession, but Governor Claiborne F. Jackson supported it. Jackson decided to mobilize the state militia to a point outside of St. Louis, where the St. Louis Arsenal was located. Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon, the commander of the arsenal, moved to disperse the militiamen on May 10 in the Camp Jackson affair; a pro-secession riot in St. Louis followed. In turn, Jackson created the Missouri State Guard as a new militia organization on May 12, appointing Major General Sterling Price as the organization's commander. After a June 11 meeting between Lyon, Jackson, Price, and United States Representative Francis P. Blair Jr. failed to lead to a peaceable compromise, Lyon moved against the state capital of Jefferson City, ejecting Jackson and the pro-secession elements of the state legislature on June 15. Two days later, the Missouri State Guard suffered another defeat at the hands of Lyon, this time at the Battle of Boonville, which led Jackson and Price to withdraw to southwestern Missouri. Lyon pursued, although a portion of his command, under Colonel Franz Sigel, was defeated at the Battle of Carthage on July 5. Price was reinforced by Confederate States Army troops commanded by Brigadier General Benjamin McCulloch; the latter commanded the combined force. On August 10, Lyon attacked the Confederate camp near Wilsons Creek. Lyon's plan in the ensuing Battle of Wilson's Creek was a pincer attack, with Lyon leading the main Union body to attack one side of the Confederate camp, and Sigel swinging a column around to attack the Confederate rear. The plan failed as Sigel was routed and Lyon was killed; the Union troops retreated all the way to Rolla after the defeat. Price followed up the Confederate victory at Wilson's Creek by driving north towards the Missouri River. On September 13, the Missouri State Guard encountered Union troops near Lexington; the city was soon placed under siege. The Union garrison surrendered on September 20, ending the Siege of Lexington. However, Major General John C. Fr√©mont concentrated Union troops near Tipton, threatening Price's position. In turn, Price withdrew to Neosho in the southwestern part of the state. On November 3, Jackson and the pro-secession elements of the state legislature voted to secede and join the Confederate States of America as a government-in-exile; the anti-secession elements of the legislature had previously voted against secession in July. Service history1862= Map of the IukaCorinth campaign Captain John C. Landis, formerly an officer in the Missouri State Guard, was authorized in December 1861 to recruit an artillery unit for official service in the Confederate States Army. Landis's recruiting operations were centered near Osceola, Missouri, and the men recruited were former members of the Missouri State Guard. Despite not being able to enlist enough men to bring the battery to full strength, the unit traveled to Des Arc, Arkansas in January 1862 to be equipped with cannons. The battery was assigned two 12-pounder Napoleon field guns and two 24-pounder howitzers; all four cannons were made of brass. The unit joined the Army of the West in March 1862 after the Battle of Pea Ridge; more men joined the unit afterwards. Archaeological evidence suggests that at least a portion of the battery may have been engaged at Pea Ridge, as part of a cannonball that could only have been fired from a 24-pounder howitzer was recovered at Pea Ridge National Military Park in 2001. As Landis's Battery was the only Confederate artillery battery armed with 24-pounder howitzers to serve west of the Mississippi River, this would likely indicate that at least a portion of the battery participated in the fighting, likely as part of Brigadier General William Y. Slack's brigade. However, other sources indicate that the battery did not see action in the battle. Around this time, the battery was assigned to Brigadier General Daniel M. Frost's artillery brigade and followed the rest of the Army of the West across the Mississippi River in mid-April. On May 1, while stationed in the vicinity of Memphis, Tennessee, the battery officially elected its officers. A muster conducted on May5 at Corinth, Mississippi, found 62 men in the battery; it also noted that the battery was armed with four cannons. Union troops had previously occupied positions near the city on May 3, beginning the Siege of Corinth. During the siege, Landis's Battery held a strong redoubt with its four cannons, dueling with Union batteries at a range of . The battery also fought in a skirmish in the vicinity on May 28 before the Confederates abandoned the city on the night of May 29/30. Landis's Battery then spent the next several months stationed at various points in Mississippi. In September 1862, Price, now commanding the Army of the West, was preparing for an offensive designed to support the Confederate Heartland Offensive. On September 14, Price occupied Iuka, Mississippi, as part of his movement; additional Confederate forces under the command of Major General Earl Van Dorn were only a four-days' march away. Major General Ulysses S. Grant, one of the top Union commanders in the region, wanted to avoid the possibility of Price and Van Dorn joining forces. To accomplish this goal, Grant sent troops commanded by Major General E. O. C. Ord to attack Iuka from the north, and others under Major General William Rosecrans to attack the city from the south. During the ensuing Battle of Iuka on September 19, Landis's Battery fought as part of Brigadier General Martin E. Green's brigade, assigned to Brigadier General Lewis Henry Little's division of the Army of the West. Although the battery came under hostile fire at Iuka, it did not fire its cannons. Price was able to fend off Rosecrans, and an acoustic shadow prevented Ord from learning of the fight until after it was over. By September 20, the Army of the West had escaped from Iuka. Price and Van Dorn then joined forces; Van Dorn commanded the combined army, as he had seniority over Price, who was relegated to corps command. Rosecrans responded to the Confederate consolidation by moving his army to Corinth on October 2. The Union position at Corinth consisted of an exterior line of fortifications built by the Confederates earlier in the war and a new inner line built as the result of orders by Major General Henry Halleck. On October 3, Van Dorn attacked, beginning the Second Battle of Corinth. Landis's Battery was part of Green's brigade of Brigadier General Louis H√©bert's division of Price's corps during the battle. During the battle, Landis's Battery continued to operate two 12-pounders and two 24-pounders. On the first day at Corinth, Landis's Battery, as well as Guibor's Missouri Battery, participated in an artillery duel with two Union batteries from the 1st Missouri Light Artillery: Battery I and Battery K. After two more Confederate artillery batteries joined the fighting, the Union artillery was forced to withdraw, allowing the infantry of Green's brigade to attack the Union line. Later that day, while the Confederate infantry was still fighting along the Union main line, Union infantry approached the Confederate flank, and advanced towards Landis's and Guibor's batteries. Artillery fire from the two batteries stopped the progress of the Union advance, and the Union infantry withdrew as darkness began to fall. The Confederate infantry assaults on October 3 had driven Rosecrans's men from the outer line, but the inner line was still in Union hands. That night, Landis's Battery fired at the interior Union lines, as the battery's guns had a longer effective range than most of the other Confederate artillery. Van Dorn then ordered another assault the next day. The October 4 fighting briefly carried portions of the inner Union line, but the gains could not be held. The Confederates withdrew from Corinth that night in defeat. Landis's Battery suffered 10 casualties at Corinth. The unit formed part of the Confederate rear guard, avoiding capture at the Battle of Davis Bridge. The battery's equipment had been damaged during the Corinth campaign, so the unit was detached to Jackson, Mississippi, for repairs. On November 29, Landis's men rejoined the Army of the West and they spent the rest of 1862 at Grenada, Mississippi. =1863= Map of the Vicksburg campaign On January 27, 1863, the battery was transferred to Grand Gulf, Mississippi, joining the defenses on the Big Black River. While stationed at Grand Gulf, the battery participated in several minor engagements with Union gunboats, although some of the artillerymen reported boredom. In mid-March, the battery guarded a point known as Winkler's Bluff on the Big Black River, with orders to allow no boats to pass the point. On April 29, Union Navy vessels commanded by Admiral David Dixon Porter bombarded the Confederate position at Grand Gulf, resulting in the Battle of Grand Gulf, although Landis's Battery was not part of the Confederate front line. One fort held out, so Grant landed 24,000 men downriver at Bruinsburg. These men soon moved east from the river, leading Brigadier General John S. Bowen, the Confederate commander at Grand Gulf, to send a blocking force to Port Gibson in an attempt to stop Grant's incursion. During the morning of May 1, Landis's Battery's two howitzers and their crews were sent to join the blocking force. During the Battle of Port Gibson, the battery fired at men of Major General John McClernand's Union corps and engaged in an artillery duel with the 8th Michigan Light Artillery; the unit suffered three casualties during the fighting and did not disengage until the late afternoon. At one point in the battle, the battery was also subjected to Union sharpshooter fire, before dispersing their attackers with canister. Despite holding initially, Union pressure eventually drove in Bowen's right, causing the Confederates to retreat before Grant outflanked them. After Port Gibson, the Confederates were forced to abandon their position at Grand Gulf on May 3; Landis's Battery again served as part of a rear guard. Meanwhile, Grant was faced with a choice: he could approach Vicksburg from either the south or the east. An attack from the south presented a more direct path to the city, but an advance from the east presented the better chance of a complete envelopment of Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton's garrison at Vicksburg, so Grant decided on the latter route. On May 12, Union troops brushed aside Confederate resistance at the Battle of Raymond before moving against Jackson, where Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston was positioned with 6,000 men. Grant attacked the city on May 14, and a Union victory in the ensuing Battle of Jackson forced Johnston out of the city, preventing him from reinforcing Pemberton. In turn, Johnston ordered Pemberton to move east and take the offensive. On May 16, Confederate Brigadier General Stephen D. Lee encountered elements of Grant's army during the move east, beginning the Battle of Champion Hill. During the battle, Landis's Battery provided artillery support for the Confederate center. By this time, Lieutenant John M. Langan had replaced Landis as battery commander, after the latter became divisional artillery commander within Bowen's Division. The infantrymen of Bowen's Division made a strong attack against the Union line, and some of the Confederate artillery, including Landis's Battery, moved forward to support the charge. As Bowen's men were deploying, Landis's and Wade's Batteries fired on Union skirmishers, temporarily dispersing them. The 17th Ohio Battery then arrived on the field, and began firing on the Confederate batteries. Landis's and Wade's guns lacked the range to effectively return fire, and the Ohioans had the better of the exchange, as Landis's two howitzers were disabled. When Bowen's attack was forced back, Landis's Battery moved forward to provide covering fire, expending all its ammunition. At one point, Landis ordered the men to fire a shell in the path of a retreating Confederate regiment in an attempt to force the men to rally. At Champion Hill, Landis's Battery suffered either five or nine casualties. Four of the losses were inflicted by a single shell fired by the 17th Ohio Battery. Pemberton's entire army retreated from the field later that day. A Confederate division commanded by Major General William W. Loring had become separated from the rest of the Confederate force during the retreat, leading Pemberton to order Bowen's division and a brigade commanded by Brigadier General John C. Vaughn to hold the crossing of the Big Black River in hopes that Loring could rejoin the main Confederate force. The next day, the battery was present at the Battle of Big Black River Bridge. The unit's exact placement during the fight is variously reported. The historian Philip Thomas Tucker reports that a portion of the battery was assigned to the Confederate front line, and the rest on the far side of the river. Tucker then states that when the Confederate line was broken by a Union assault, that front line portion of the battery lost its cannons, as the battery's horses had been sent to the other side of the Big Black River. Other sources state that the battery was positioned entirely on the far side of the river. The historian James McGhee states that the two pieces damaged at Champion Hill were not present at this action. Either way, the portion of the battery across the river helped cover the Confederate retreat, and entered the fortifications of Vicksburg. During the Siege of Vicksburg, some of the artillerymen served as sharpshooters due to a shortage of cannons. On May 22, the battery helped repulse Union attacks, at one point using double-shotted ammunition. Over the course of the siege, the unit suffered either 10 or 13 casualties during a 47-day span of mostly continuous fighting. The Confederates surrendered Vicksburg on July 4, and Landis's Battery was captured at this time.

She was a founding member of the Metropolitan Council on Housing and the Cooper Square Committee. Beginning in 1959, she led a successful campaign to defeat an urban renewal plan of Robert Moses, which would have replaced historic, affordable housing with a freeway in the Lower East Side. For decades, Goldin was associated with the Lower East Side, where she was a neighborhood preservationist and community figure. The 175 Essex Building of Essex Crossing is named in her honor, and she was profiled in the documentary It Took 50 Years.  Early life  Frances Goldin was born on June 22, 1924, and she grew up in Springfield Gardens, Queens. Her parents were working-class Jewish immigrants from Russia and Ukraine. Her father, Michael Axler, was a toolmaker and mechanic for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). Frances described him as a \\"freethinker\\" and \\"very much a union man.\\" Her mother, Sophie (Saslowsky) Axler, was a homemaker and former seamstress who had been fired due to her union activity. Frances had a difficult youth; she described her childhood as \\"miserable.\\" Her neighborhood was almost entirely Christian. She experienced antisemitism, and bricks flew at her family's window when they lit candles on Friday night for Shabbat on at least two occasions. She also experienced class discrimination as a child. Many of the neighborhood families were wealthier, and neighborhood fathers often worked in business capacities. As she later explained, \\"I hated where we lived... We were one of nine Jewish families. The other eight Jewish families were shopkeepers. My father was a worker. So we were shunned by the non-Jews and shunned by the Jews, because my father worked with his hands.\\" As a teen, Goldin attended Andrew Jackson High School, where she was valedictorian. Her parents expected her to become a traditional Jewish wife. Her mother wanted her to go to secretarial school rather than college. During this time, Goldin met communists while working at the War Shipping Administration, and \\"they quickly converted me.\\" When Goldin was 19 years old, she joined the Communist Party. She enrolled in the Jefferson School of Social Science, an adult education school that was founded and managed by the Communist Party USA. At Jefferson, Goldin studied the history of capitalism and socialism, and she read Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. In 1944, when Frances was 20 years old, she married Morris Goldin. The couple had met through the Communist Party. Morris was also a party member, and he was a leader of the Government Workers‚Äô Union. The couple moved to the Lower East Side in Manhattan, where they lived in a one-bedroom apartment in the fourth floor of a building. In the Lower East Side, she found \\"nirvana.\\" She explained, \\"It was amazing to see people of different nationalities, colors, opinions, living together in harmony. And what bound them was poverty.\\"  Early activism  Goldin first became involved with housing rights activism when she visited the Lower East Side Tenement and Consumer Council. At the time, she wanted to confirm that she was being charged the correct rent ($65 per month) by her landlord. After confirming that this was the case, \\"...they said, 'You seem intelligent, would you like to come work in the tenant council and help us out?' I said sure, and I‚Äôve worked with the tenant council ever since. I never left,\\" as she explained in an interview. In some of her early work, Frances helped translate and interpret for Yiddish speakers at the tenant clinic. She also met with local American Labor Party organizers. In 1950, when she was 27 years old, Goldin ran for the New York State Senate, as part of the American Labor Party. The ticket also included W.E.B. DuBois. Due to these political activities, the Goldins were blacklisted and under surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). This resulted in her husband losing her job, and Frances became the sole income earner in the family. She supported the family by working as a secretary.  Cooper Square activism  In 1959, she led an effort to oppose a Robert Moses plan to bulldoze twelve blocks of the Lower East Side, which was marketed as \\"urban renewal.\\" The plan was to build a proposed Cross-Manhattan Expressway, so that wealthy residents could more easily commute to Wall Street. Through these efforts, Goldin co-founded Cooper Square Committee, along with Thelma Burdick and Walter Thabit. The Committee advocates for affordable housing and tenant rights. In 1961, the Committee released Alternate Plan for Cooper Square, which proposed the building of public housing on vacant lots. Through their pressures, a vote was made by the New York City Board of Estimate, which adopted the Alternate Plan for Cooper Square. In total, the work of Goldin and the Committee saved 328 tenement apartments, and an additional 530 income- restricted apartments were later built in Cooper Square. Despite these efforts, the Committee struggled to find wider support in local government until David Dinkins became mayor. In 1990, they signed a Memorandum of Understanding, which stated that they would oversee affordable housing development in neighborhood under the Cooper Square Mutual Housing Association. Finally, in 2012, the Committee's plan came to fruition, after years of activism, when the city decided to develop a housing cooperative, where residents could buy their apartments for as little as $250 per unit. She said, \\"We organized and demonstrated and finally beat [Robert Moses] 50 years later.\\" The story of Cooper Square Committee has inspired other local groups that advocate for the poor in New York City, such as Picture the Homeless. Goldin was also a founding member of the Metropolitan Council for Housing, and she became an advocate for squatter rights.  Seward Park activism  In the 1960s, Goldin was involved in the movement that advocated for former tenants of Seward Park. In total, 1800 residents had been displaced by Seward Park Urban Renewal Area on Delancey Street, with the evacuation process largely completed by 1959. The effort was initially led by Robert Moses, as part of his Slum Clearance Committee, and then continued to be led by other organizations and interests. Goldin advocated for the right of the former tenants to return to their homes. The elite figures of the neighborhood represented the interests of the primarily assimilated, middle-class tenants. Meanwhile, the primarily Asian and Latino immigrant tenants represented a newer generation in the neighborhood. In 2018, after fifty years of struggle, a 100-unit low-income senior citizen building was completed in the area, where 50% of the units are allocated for affordable housing. The building was named Frances Goldin Houses in her honor.  Literary agency  Beginning in the 1950s, Goldin began to work in a small literary agency, so she could begin to understand the publishing industry. Eventually, in 1977, Goldin launched Frances Goldin Literary Agency, which focused on left-wing writers. Her clients included Dorothy Allison, Staceyann Chin, Martin Duberman, Mumia Abu- Jamal, Barbara Kingsolver, Adrienne Rich, Robert Meeropol, Juan Gonzalez, and Mike Wallace. She said, \\"I do not market any material that is sexist, racist, homophobic or gratuitously violent.\\" Many of the authors were included in Imagine: Living in a Socialist USA, published by Goldin, in 2014.  Protests  Goldin was a recognizable figure in multiple protest movements and marches. She was a longtime advocate for LGBTQ rights and participated in the NYC Pride March for 35 years. She was known to carry a sign that read, \\"I Adore my Lesbian Daughters KEEP THEM SAFE,\\" and she became a recognizable figure of the parades. As she aged, Goldin continued to protest. In 2011, Goldin was involved in the Occupy Wall Street protests. She was known to carry a sign that said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 87 and MAD AS HELL.\\" In 2018, when she was 92 years old, she participated in the Women's March in a wheelchair. She raised her fist and chanted, \\"92 and Comin‚Äô Through!‚Äù For many years, Goldin was known for her outspoken personality and distinctive style. In her old age, she had a neon purple streak in her white hair, and she wore a pin that said \\"TAX THE RICH,\\" which was pinned to a purple sweatshirt.  Personal life  Goldin was married to Morris Goldin, a staff member of the New York State American Labor Party and advisor to Congressman Vito Marcantonio in East Harlem. Frances and Morris divorced in 1971. The couple had two daughters, Sally and Reeni, who are both lesbians. They both came out after their first pride parade in 1970. Every year since then Goldin attended the NYC Pride Parade where she was always seen holding the same banner: \\"I Adore My Lesbian Daughters- Keep Them Safe.\\"  Death  On May 16, 2020, Goldin died at her home on East 11th Street, where she had lived for nearly 50 years. She had endured years of declining health before her death. She was 95 years old. The New York Times called her a \\"...protester, provocateur and voice for lost causes\\" in its obituary. The Indypendent dedicated a full page obituary to her, in which they wrote, \\"Frances Goldin was relentless, her enthusiasm infectious. And her life shows the value of being a long distance runner.\\" She is survived by her daughter Reeni Goldin and daughter-in-law Marge Burns, daughter Sally Goldin, and her grandson, Morris Goldin.

Location  In the center of Bordeaux, close to the town hall and the square Gambetta, the museum is accessible by line B of the tramway de Bordeaux from station Gambetta- M√©riadeck.  History  H√¥tel de Lalande = In 1778, the architect Etienne Laclotte built for the parlementarian jurist Pierre de Raymond de Lalande, the H√¥tel de Lalande, one of the most beautiful townhouses in Bordeaux. Belonging to the \\"noblesse de robe\\", Raymond de Lalande used to possess, by his marriage to Jeanne de Lalande-Gayon, dame d‚ÄôUrtubie, extensive holdings with slaves in the colony of Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti)https://madd-bordeaux.fr/en/museum/unique-history. Sold in 1828, the property of the Lalande heirs changed hands several times during the 19th century. Finally, in 1880 the city of Bordeaux acquired the H√¥tel de Lalande and converted into a police and vice control headquarters. At the rear of the property, a jail was built in the former garden. = The museum = In 1925, several rooms of the H√¥tel de Lalande were used to display works of art belonging to the City of Bordeaux. The first museum was called Mus√©e d'Art ancien. The museum was obliged to close during World War Two, and in 1940 the collections were crated and stored in the cellars of the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts (Fine Arts Museum). On 2 July 1955, the museum reopened to the public as the Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs (Decorative Arts Museum). In 1984, the museum was converted to evoke a wealthy aristocratic residence, typical of the Enlightenment in Bordeaux and its reserves are located in the former prison. In 2013, the institution was renamed the Mus√©e des Arts d√©coratifs et du Design on Constance Rubini's initiative, thus indicating the wish to turn it into a major place for disseminating the culture of design. The former jail building now houses the temporary exhibitions.  Historical Monuments  Both buildings, the h√¥tel de Lalande and the former prison, are classified as historical monuments in 2018.  Collections  The museography features several reconstitutions (in the spirit of American period rooms) as well as rooms in which display cases and antique furniture exist side by side in tasteful harmony. The museum's collections had expanded, ranging from the Middle Ages to the late 18th century and illustrating the applied arts in crafts involving wood, metal, earth and fire. In particular, the ceramics collections, through their extraordinary wealth and variety, were unsurpassed in France.

Anne and her five sisters all were \\"beautiful and charming belles of Wilmington and Philadelphia, where they made their debuts.\\" They spent a year in Europe with their parents, arriving in Vienna in the early 1880s. Matilda was the only daughter who ever returned to America. Reportedly, every time their father would return from his trip back to Philadelphia to manage the family business, one of his daughters would be engaged. Personal life On December 17, 1890, Anne was married to Friedrich Wilhelm, Prince of Ardeck (1858‚Äì1902) in Dresden. At the time of their wedding, the Prince, the eldest son of Maria von Hanau-Ho≈ôowitz and Prince William of Hesse-Philippsthal-Barchfeld, was a Lieutenant of the 2nd Hussar Regiment of the Prussian Army.

Notwithstanding that his mother was a daughter of William II, Elector of Hesse and Princess Augusta of Prussia (a daughter of King Frederick William II of Prussia), the Grand Duke of Hesse-Darmstadt regarded his parent's marriage as morganatic. Upon his parent's divorce in 1872, his mother and the children were styled Princess of Ardeck and Princes of Ardeck.Michel Huberty: L' Allemagne dynastique: Les 15 familles qui ont fait l'empire, vol. 1: Hesse -- Reuss -- Saxe, Le Perreux-sur-Marne, 1976, Her mother died in Stuttgart in April 1892.

He is best known as the creator, director and co-writer of The Chosen, the first multi-season series about the life of Christ, and the highest crowd-funded media project of all time. Jenkins's career is focused on faith-based media. In an interview with the Chicago Sun Times, Jenkins said, \\"We feel like if people can binge watch and have watch parties all over the world for shows like Game of Thrones and Stranger Things, there‚Äôs no reason not to binge watch a show about Jesus. The term binge means to, you know, kind of have an obsession with something, and if we figure out how to have an obsession with Jesus, we might as well encourage that.\\"  Early life  Jenkins‚Äô father is Jerry B. Jenkins, a Christian novelist best known for the Left Behind series, one of the highest selling book series of all time, selling over 60 million copies. Jenkins graduated from University of Northwestern-St. Paul in 1997, where he met his wife, Amanda.

After this, Jenkins made a short film for his church in Elgin, Illinois, U.S., The Shepherd; filmed on a friend's farm in Marengo.

Done in oil on canvas, Bubbles - Chardin‚Äôs first figural painting - depicts a young man blowing a soap bubble. Chardin's original work is currently in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and two later versions of the painting are in the collections of the Los Angeles County Museum and the National Gallery of Art.  Description  Though he had been trained as an academic artist, Chardin often shirked away from academic art. Notably, he resisted painting figures using models, instead choosing to paint from memory or conceptually during the early stages of his career. His first painting in which he used a model to paint a picture was Soap Bubbles, thus making said painting his first figural painting. Chardin exhibited his work at the 1739 Paris Salon, though which version of Soap Bubbles he presented is not known. Some sources speculate that Chardin chose soap bubbles as a subject due to their historical appearance in 17th-century Dutch paintings where they served as allusions to the transience of life.

It is the largest YMCA resident facility in the United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. The seven-story building was designed in the Jacobethan Revival and Late Gothic Revival styles by Walter F. Shattuck. The YMCA was first established in Columbus in 1855, reorganized in 1875, and moved locations numerous times. The organization purchased the lot for the current YMCA in 1916, with delayed construction due to World War I. The building was constructed in 1923 and dedicated in 1924. With no renovation since about 1997, and after years of studying potential renovations, the 403-unit building is set to close in three to seven years, as the YMCA moves its residents to newer facilities.

The organization plans to lease out a facility and redistribute residents to existing facilities, and to build a new full-service downtown facility for its 3,400 YMCA members in the next five to ten years. The YMCA is confident the building can be repurposed, having talked to 8-10 developers, with none who have toured having proposed demolishing it.https://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/news/2019/10/08/downtown-ymca-to- shutter-more-modern-facility.htmlhttps://radio.wosu.org/post/hundreds- downtown-ymca-residents-be-moved-over-next-few-years#stream/0 See also * National Register of Historic Places listings in Columbus, Ohio ReferencesExternal links * *Official website Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1924 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Columbus, Ohio Category:Buildings in downtown Columbus, Ohio Category:YMCA buildings in the United States ","title":"Downtown YMCA"},{"id":"64019639","text":"Kavitakusumavali () was the first poetry magazine published in Dhaka in what is today Bangladesh.

(German: Kinder- und Hausm√§rchen). A princess falls into the glass mountain and is entrapped by Old Rinkrank. She becomes his slave until she frees herself.  Synopsis  A king has a glass mountain built, declaring that whoever scales its slope could marry his daughter. The princess decides to aid one of the suitors. As the princess and her suitor climb, she slips; the glass mountain opens up and swallows her. She is found by Old Rinkrank in the cave she falls into. He offers her death or servitude. As his servant, she washes his dishes, makes his bed, and grows old. He takes to calling her Mother Mansrot. Every day Old Rinkrank takes his ladder out of his pocket, using it to climb to the top of mountain, and pulls the ladder up behind him. Every evening he returns with gold and silver to add to his hoard. One day Mother Mansrot washes his dishes, makes his bed, then shuts all the doors and windows, except one small window. She refuses to open up when Rinkrank returns. He looks through the small window to see what she is up to, and she slams the window sash on his beard. Trapped, he must surrender the ladder. After climbing to the top of the mountain, she releases him by pulling on a long rope. Returning to her father and betrothed, she tells them what has happened to her. The king condemns Old Rinkrank to death, taking his gold and silver. The princess finally marries, and they live in splendor and joy.  History and background  This story did not appear in the Grimms‚Äô collection until the sixth edition of the seven they produced. According to their notes, they found it in Frisian Archiv von Ehrentraut, written in Frisian dialect, which may have appealed to the Grimms because of its rustic nature, but which is difficult to read in German and more difficult to translate into English. One verse of rhyme, in particular, has been construed variously as ‚ÄúHere stand I, poor Rinkrank, On my seventeen long shanks, On my weary, worn-out foot,‚Äù and also as ‚ÄúHere I stand, poor Rinkrank, Seventeen feet long I stand on planks, On my tired-out feet.‚Äù There are numerous glass mountain stories. They harken back to Brynhildr‚Äôs deliverance from the Hall of Flame, protected by a wall of shields atop Mount Hindarfjall, which only the horse Grani could reach. Usually, the variants involve a princess sitting on top of the glass mountain, often holding a golden apple, to which knights on horseback must ascend.

A Russian scientific journal rejected Zak's paper as being too informal, as did the bioRxiv preprint repository, and Zak published it instead on ResearchGate, a social networking site for scientists and researchers.

Early life Przemys≈Çaw \\"Przemek\\" Ogrodzi≈Ñski was born to a Polish family in Lemberg (modern Lviv, Ukraine) in the Austrian Empire. Lemberg was the capital of the Austrian province of Galicia, a region that spanned modern southeastern Poland and western Ukraine. Galicia was populated by a mixture of Poles, Ukrainians, and Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazi Jews. Shortly after Ogrodzi≈Ñski's birth, Galicia became part of the newly re-established Poland and Lemberg became the Polish city of Lw√≥w. Ogrodzi≈Ñski graduated in law from Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w, before returning to his hometown, where he became active in the ZwiƒÖzek Niezale≈ºnej M≈Çodzie≈ºy Socjalistycznej (Union of Independent Socialist Youth). As an young socialist activist in Lw√≥w, Ogrodzi≈Ñski had many Jewish friends who were active in the Socialist movement. Occupation and the Underground In September 1939, the Soviet Union joined Germany in invading Poland. Polish Galicia was annexed to the Soviet Ukraine and Lw√≥w was again renamed, now as Lvov. Under Soviet rule, Ogrodzi≈Ñski together with his father were imprisoned under charges of falsifying documents. In June 1941, Germany invaded the USSR and captured the Soviet half of Poland on the way. The Germans restored the Galician capital's Austrian name: Lemberg. Under the German occupation, Ogrodzi≈Ñski became involved in resistance activities, as a member of the Polish Socialist Party ‚Äì Freedom, Equality, Independence and as the editor of the underground socialist newspaper O wolno≈õƒá i niezale≈ºno≈õƒá (For Freedom and Independence). Under the German occupation, the entire Jewish population of the city was forced to live in a ghetto, in dismal conditions. In August 1941, Ogrodzi≈Ñski assisted with the publication of an underground newspaper in the ghetto: Lwowski Tygodnik,. In May 1943, Ogrodzi≈Ñski was a founding member of the Lw√≥w branch of ≈ªegota, the Council to Aid Jews. He served as the treasurer to the local branch of ≈ªegota that sought to hide Jews outside the ghetto and smuggle food to those still inside the ghetto. Working closely with the local chairwoman of ≈ªegota, W≈Çadys≈Çawa Choms, later known as the \\"Angel of Lvov\\", Ogrodzi≈Ñski worked to obtain the money that bought the extra food for the ghetto and which bought materials to make the false papers for Jews to escape the ghetto. During his dangerous work for Zegota, Ogrodzi≈Ñski adopted the alias 'Stanis≈Çaw'. Many Ukrainians in Lemberg believed the Reich would establish an independent Ukrainian state after its expected \\"final victory\\" and the city became a dangerous place in which to operate. The Polish historian Teresa Prekerowa wrote the sheer number of Ukrainian collaborators in the city made Lemberg a particularly dangerous city for Polish resistance work. On 3 June 1943, the Germans liquidated the Lemberg ghetto, sending in Ukrainian police units to round up most of the Jews. They were sent to the Be≈Ä≈ºec death camp, where almost all of them were exterminated immediately on arrival. A few thousand \\"work Jews\\" (skilled laborers) were retained at a camp on Janowska street until October 1943, when they were killed in turn. Zegota's work was limited to helping the few hundred Jews who had escaped from either the ghetto or the Janowska street camp. It cost about 500 zlotys to support one Jew in hiding per month. Despite the difficulties, it is estimated that Ogrodzi≈Ñski as the treasurer of the Lw√≥w branch of ≈ªegota was able to extend financial assistance to between 100‚Äì200 Jews living in hiding in the city. During this time, Ogrodzi≈Ñski married a fellow ≈ªegota worker, Halina Jacu≈Ñska-Ogrodzi≈Ñska. She later recalled: \\"≈ªegota had its headquarters in Warsaw, under the auspices of the underground government which represented several political groupings. In Lvov there was a parallel union of political parties. Przemek acted on behalf of the PPS. The PPS played an important role because, among other things, it had a lot of Jewish members...we sent as many people as possible away from Lvov. We needed documents [fake identity cards, called ‚ÄòAryan papers‚Äô] for this.\\" At considerable risk to her life, Halina Jacu≈Ñska-Ogrodzi≈Ñska hid two Jewish women, Maria Glass and Olga Lilien, for she which was recognized by the Yad Vashem Institute in Jerusalem as one of Righteous Among the Nations on 28 June 1979. The People's Republic of Poland and Diplomacy On 27 July 1944, Lemberg was recaptured by the Red Army and its name reverted to Lvov; the region was incorporated into the Soviet Union. In October 1944, Ogrodzi≈Ñski became a member of OMTUR (Oganizacja Mlodziezowa Towarzystwa Uniwersytetu Robotniczego-Youth Organization of the Workers' University Society). On 31 December 1944, Ogrodzi≈Ñski became a member of the State National Council. He served as a member of the National Council's Foreign Affairs Committee. ;Rome & home In 1945, Ogrodzi≈Ñski joined the Polish diplomatic corps and served as a counselor in the Polish embassy in Rome. In 1948, he returned to Poland to take part in the congress that united the Polish Workers' Party and the Polish Socialist Party into the Polish United Workers' Party, which was the official name of the Communist Party. In 1951, he was awarded 2nd Class Knight's Officer in the Order of the Banner of Labour. ;Paris On 10 July 1952, he became the charg√© d'affaires at the Polish embassy in Paris, serving as the de facto head of the Polish embassy until the spring of 1954, as the Polish ambassador to France was absent. In Paris, Ogrodzi≈Ñski was keen to capitalise on the weakening relations between France and the United States. His opportunity came with the proposed European Defence Community (EDC) which would permit West German rearmament, a subject arousing fierce opposition in France at the time. Working closely with Sergei Vinogradov, the Soviet ambassador in Paris, Ogrodzi≈Ñski sought to maximise the traditional French sympathy for Poland to make the case that the EDC was a reckless move, endangering the peace of Europe. Ogrodzi≈Ñski also stated that the United States, by forcefully supporting West German rearmament, was a danger to all of Europe. As part of his diplomacy, Ogrodzi≈Ñski cultivated French politicians, reminding them of the historical Franco-Polish friendship going back centuries, and in December 1953 arranged for the visit of a group of National Assembly members to Poland. The French delegation was co-headed by the former premier, √âdouard Daladier, and Jacques Soustelle. As Soustelle was close to General Charles de Gaulle at the time, Ogrodzi≈Ñski felt that Soustelle's visit to Poland was a sign that the Gaullists were sympathetic to the anti-EDC forces. ;Indochina and the ICC From 1954 to 1956, Ogrodzi≈Ñski served as the first Polish Commissioner to the International Control Commission (ICC). The ICC supervised the Geneva Accords in Vietnam and comprised three delegations, from: Poland, Canada and India, with the Indian Commissioner serving as the Chief Commissioner of the ICC. Ogrodzi≈Ñski was given much leeway to operate in the manner that he felt best on the ICC, and contrary to expectations held in the West, he did not consult much with Moscow, Beijing or Warsaw before making a decision. Ogrodzi≈Ñski was informed \\"that the Indians must not be antagonized\\" as India's socialist neutralism was felt to make the Indians favorable to the Soviet bloc, but he was told to expect the worse from the Canadians whom it was believed were serving \\"agencies of the US\\". The first conference of the ICC in New Delhi on 1‚Äì6 August 1954 did not bring about the expected Canadian-Polish clash. The government of Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent was reluctant to have Canada involved in the ICC and only agreed under heavy American pressure. As a consequence, the Canadians wanted to keep their delegation as small as possible. The Poles also wanted to keep their delegation small owning largely to a shortage of diplomats and soldiers with the necessary knowledge of French and English. Thus, for different reasons, at the first meeting of the ICC, both the Poles and Canadians found themselves in agreement about the size of the ICC. On 18 August 1954, the ICC began its work in Vietnam. Ogrodzi≈Ñski reported to Warsaw that the authorities in both Vietnams did not provide the ICC delegations with offices to work in with meetings being held in the hotel rooms of the delegates, which he reported as having \\"improved the atmosphere\\". Right from the start, Ogrodzi≈Ñski complained that he needed more delegates who were fluent in French and English. Ogrodzi≈Ñski noted that all of the Indian delegates were fluent in English and some of the Canadian delegation were French-Canadian, and even the majority who were English-Canadian usually spoke good French. He wrote that everything the Polish delegation achieved was made possible \\"at the expense of simply unbelievable improvisations\\". A particular problem were the uniforms provided to the Polish delegation, which were not designed for the tropics and which disintegrated after being run through the washing machine a couple of times. One of the Canadian diplomats called Ogrodzi≈Ñski \\"a formidable opponent\\" and \\"the Polish version of Machiavelli\\". Another Canadian diplomat recalled: \\"He impressed us as able and forceful, and he also has charm, a dangerous combination\\". The acting Canadian Commissioner, R.M. Macdonnell, pressed for the Communist Viet Minh to release all of their French prisoners of war (POW) swiftly, but Ogrodzi≈Ñski sided with the Viet Minh who stated they would release the POWs slowly. Despite the tensions with the Canadian delegation, Ogrodzi≈Ñski reported with some surprise to Warsaw that: \\"you cannot see pro-American tendencies in the Canadians (which is extremely interesting)\\". He also reported that relations with other delegations were good, writing: an \\"Idyll of unanimity continues in the Commission\\". ;Foreign Ministry From 1956 to 1962 Ogrodzi≈Ñski was the Director- General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, making him the number three man in the Foreign Ministry. The new Polish Foreign Minister, Adam Rapacki, was one of the leaders of the more liberal side of the Communist party, but most of the team he selected were people who had loyally served the Stalinist regime. Ogrodzi≈Ñski had loyally served the Stalinist faction prior to 1956, but after 1956 as Rapacki's right-hand man he became associated with the liberalizing faction in the Communist Party. The Polish historian W≈Äodzimier Borodziej described Ogrodzi≈Ñski as typical of the Polish generation whose formative life experiences were the German occupation in World War Two. For many of Ogrodzi≈Ñski's generation, the refusal of the West German government, established in 1949, to recognize the Oder-Neisse line as Poland's western frontier, whilst maintaining a territorial claim to various territories now part of Poland, looked alarmingly similar to the refusal of successive German governments, in the interwar period, to recognize the eastern frontiers of Germany established by the Treaty of Versailles. The fact that many of the officials in the West German government were men who had loyally served the Nazi regime added to the Polish concerns regarding West Germany. Thus, for Ogrodzi≈Ñski and many other Poles, the perceived threat of German irredentism and revanchism caused them to look for the Soviet Union as a counterweight, all the more so as the United States and other Western powers had allied themselves with West Germany and did not criticize the West German refusal to accept the Oder-Neisse line. Ogrodzi≈Ñski saw the Soviet domination of Poland as a lesser evil compared to the possibility of a return to a neo-Nazi occupation. Ogrodzi≈Ñski as a director-general at the Foreign Ministry was very close to Rapacki, serving as one as his principle advisers. The background of Ogrodzi≈Ñski as a socialist turned communist was exactly the same as Rapacki, who saw him as a kindred spirit. Rapacki was a self-described \\"socialist humanist\\" who spent much of World War Two in a German POW camp and who had reluctantly joined the Communist Party in 1948. Like Ogrodzi≈Ñski, Rapacki's World War Two experiences had convinced him that Germany was a far greater threat to Poland than the Soviet Union, and through Rapacki was known for wanting Poland to have greater independence from Moscow and for greater freedom of expression within Poland, he was convinced that Poland needed the Soviet Union to counter the perceived threat of German revanchism. In 1957, the administration of President Dwight Eisenhower complained the United States was bearing a disproportionate amount of the costs associated with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and publicity suggested perhaps the United States should transfer nuclear weapons to West Germany as a way to force the western European states to spend more on NATO. Through Eisenhower's gambit was intended to force greater defense spending in western Europe, in Warsaw the mere suggestion that the United States was going to arm West Germany with nuclear weapons provoked immense fear as the Poles were convinced that the West Germans would use nuclear weapons against them sooner or later to take back the lands east of the Oder-Neisse line. To preempt this possibility, Rapacki together with several officials at the Foreign Ministry such as Ogrodzi≈Ñski developed the Rapacki Plan calling for Central Europe to be a nuclear weapons free zone. Ogrodzi≈Ñski was described by the Polish historian Piotr Wandycz as one of the \\"fathers of the Rapacki plan\\". Under the Rapacki plan, no nuclear weapons nor missiles capable of firing nuclear weapons would be allowed in both Germanies, Poland and Czechoslovakia. From the Polish perspective, the Rapacki plan had the additional advantage of keeping the Soviet Union from stationing nuclear weapons in Poland, which would mean that in the event of World War Three, that there would be no American nuclear strikes to destroy them, thereby limiting the amount of nuclear fall-out in Poland. Many in the West assumed the Rapacki Plan was a Soviet diplomatic initiative, but in fact, it was a Polish diplomatic initiative, through permission still had to be asked of Moscow first. During his talks with East German officials about the Rapacki Plan, Ogrodzi≈Ñski rejected any joint East German-Polish diplomatic offensive, telling the East German diplomat Otto Winzer that the chances of the Rapacki plan being accepted by the West would be greater if it was seen as a purely Polish diplomatic initiative. ;India In a demotion, Ogrodzi≈Ñski was appointed the Polish ambassador to India. Despite his removal to New Delhi, Ogrodzi≈Ñski still retained influence as one of the favorite advisers to Rapacki. Because an Indian diplomat always served as the Chief Commissioner of the ICC, the Polish Foreign Ministry attached much importance to relations with India in the 1960s, and Ogrodzi≈Ñski was appointed ambassador in New Delhi largely because Rapacki wanted an able diplomat whom he could trust as the ambassador to India. On 24 September 1962, Ogrodzi≈Ñski presented his credentials to President Rajendra Prasad of India at the Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi. From February‚ÄìJune 1963, he also served as the Polish ambassador to Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka). As an ambassador, Ogrodzi≈Ñski was involved in the Marigold negotiations, an attempt in 1966 to end the Vietnam war. During the Marigold talks, Ogrodzi≈Ñski was in regular contact with Roland Michener, the Canadian high commissioner in New Delhi, as proposals were made to have a conference chaired by the ICC powers. Ogrodzi≈Ñski advised Warsaw to \\"express our consent\\", as rejecting the proposal would \\"strengthen Rightist tendencies\\" in the Indian government, while accepting it \\"could be played out to show that the rigidity of the Canadians makes it impossible to come to an understanding\\". ;Norway In 1968, in the aftermath of the \\"March Events\\", Ogrodzi≈Ñski refused to join the \\"anti-Zionist\\" campaign that saw a number of Polish Jews sacked from their jobs. Rapacki was sacked in 1968, and Ogrodzi≈Ñski's career went into decline with his sacking. In another demotion, Ogrodzi≈Ñski was appointed ambassador to Norway. On 10 June 1969, Ogrodzi≈Ñski presented his credentials as Poland's ambassador to King Olav V of Norway at the Royal Palace, Oslo. He was also appointed the Polish ambassador to Iceland. On 15 October 1969, he traveled to Reykjav√≠k to present his credentials to President Kristj√°n Eldj√°rn at the Bessasta√∞ir. He served as the Polish ambassador to Norway and Iceland until his retirement in May 1975.

She is the ex-wife of former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Biography Occelli was born in 1949 in Mexico City as one of nine children. Her father, Armando Occelli, was an engineer, while her mother, Ana Maria Gonz√°lez, raised the children. Occelli attended primary school at the Instituto Guadalupe and secondary school at the Instituto F√©lix de Jes√∫s Rougier, a school run by the Sisters of the Holy Spirit and Mary Immaculate. Occelli then pursued an early career as a bilingual executive secretary. She first met Carlos Salinas de Gortari in 1958 when both were around ten years old at a party for the National Association of Charros, where both of Occelli's brothers were members. They were introduced to each other by Carlos Salinas', Adriana Salinas. However, they did not begin dating until 1965, when she was 16-years old and he was 17, when both met at another charro party. The relationship ended in 1968 when Carlos Salinas moved to the United States to study economics. In 1971, Occelli and Salinas reconnected when both were in Williamsburg, Virginia. Salinas soon asked Occelli to marry him. The couple wed on April 15, 1972, at the Barrio de las Aguilas church in Mexico City. They moved to Boston, where Salinas began his master's degree program at Harvard University. Occelli became pregnant with their first child during his first semester at Harvard. Their oldest daughter, Cecilia, was born on January 22, 1974. Their second child, Emiliano, was born on February 19, 1976, while their youngest son, Juan Crist√≥bal, was born in 1979. Cecilia Occelli served as First Lady of Mexico from 1988 to 1994 during her husband's presidency. She focused on issues facing children, young people and the elderly. She promoted related civic programs and projects, notably the creation of the Papalote Museo del Ni√±o, a children's museum in Chapultepec which opened in 1993. Occelli also simultaneously served as the President of the National System for Integral Family Development (DIF) from 1988 to 1994. President Salinas left office in 1994 at the end of his single term. He traveled to New York City in December 1994 soon after leaving office. When he returned to Mexico in 1995, he surprised Occelli by immediately announcing that he wanted to divorce her. The divorce was finalized later in 1995, abruptly ending their 23-year marriage. Shortly after his divorce from Occelli, Salinas married his second wife, Ana Paula Gerard Rivero, whom he is believed to have met in 1983. Gerard Rivero had worked as a technical secretary for the Economic Cabinet during the Salinas administration. During the 2000s, Occelli became President of the Fundaci√≥n de Apoyo Infantil A.C., which works in conjunction with Save the Children. Occelli also continued to serve on the board of trustees for the Papalote Museo del Ni√±o, which she helped to establish. In 2010, author Rosa Mar√≠a Valles Ruiz released a biography of Occelli entitled \\"El encanto de la discreci√≥n\\" (\\"The Charm of Discretion\\") with Occelli's help. Occelli appeared with Valles Ruiz at the book's release party, which was held at the Papalote Museo del Ni√±o in March 2010. In the book, which recounts her life, Occelli expressed pride in the work accomplished by her former husband, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, and said that she was \\"proud for having shared 20 years of my life with him.\\" References Category:Living people Category:Date of birth unknown Category:1949 births Category:First Ladies of Mexico Category:People from Mexico City ","title":"Cecilia Occelli"},{"id":"64020122","text":"By-elections () are held in Italy whenever a parliamentary seat becomes vacant in either the Chamber of Deputies or the Senate of the Republic.
