The black comedy focuses on David, a blind Vietnam War veteran who finds himself unable to come to terms with his actions on the battlefield and alienated from his family because they neither can accept his disability nor understand his wartime experience. Rabe explores the conflicted feelings of many civilians during the era by parodying the ideal American family as it was portrayed on the television sitcom The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet. Beneath the perfect facade of the playwright's fictional Nelson family are layers of prejudice, bigotry, and self-hatred that are peeled away slowly as they interact with their physically and emotionally damaged son and brother. Sticks and Bones was the second play in Rabe's Vietnam trilogy, following The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel and preceding Streamers. A veteran himself, he wrote it while a graduate student at Villanova University, where it was staged in 1969. The off-Broadway production, directed by Jeff Bleckner, opened on November 7, 1971 at Joseph Papp's Public Theater, where it ran for 121 performances. The cast included David Selby as David, Tom Aldredge as Ozzie, Elizabeth Wilson as Harriet, and Cliff DeYoung as Rick. In 1973, Robert Downey Sr. wrote the teleplay for and directed a CBS television film based on Rabe's play. The cast included DeYoung as David, Aldredge as Ozzie, and Anne Jackson as Harriet.

At the end of her life, she was actively teaching as a faculty member of Boston University and the Manhattan School of Music as well as teaching privately. Career Lawrence was born into a prominent family with historic roots in New England (Lawrence, Massachusetts). Her father was a prominent businessman in New Orleans, at one time owner of the first cold-storage warehouse in the city. He once boated the length of the Mississippi with Mr. Hormel, of the meat-packing plant in Minnesota. She was a fourth-generation harpist, beginning her studies at age six. Her aunt was for many years a prominent non-professional Boston harpist, who performed the Boston premiere of the Debussy Sonata for harp, flute and viola. At the age of eight, Lucile appeared as soloist with the New Orleans Junior Philharmonic. A prodigious student, she was introduced to Carlos Salzedo while he was in New Orleans performing on tour with his Trio de Lutece, and began private study with him in New York and Seal Harbor at age fourteen, then returned to finish high school at age fifteen, thereafter studying full-time in New York. Her advanced studies were all conducted privately, with music history and theory lessons taken with the eminent composer Edgard Varese. [all notes from private conversations with Miss Lawrence and other published articles] Her studies consisted of at least two harp lessons a week, piano study and practicing harp four to five hours daily, along with two hours of piano, French studies, and swimming and riding. It was during summers of study in the artistic colony of Seal Harbor, Maine that Lucile came to know many society people and prominent musicians. She recalled the games of charades all would gather to play, and how Leopold Stokowski would swaddle his head in diapers to play the clue, \\"Moses in the bullrushes\\". She made her professional debut at age 18 with an eight-month concert tour of Australia and New Zealand, a lengthy 123-concert tour of joint recitals with the soprano Edna Thomas. She enjoyed recalling lunching with Fritz Kreisler while on tour, as he was also touring the same area. Upon returning to the U.S., she continued her private study with Salzedo, toured as first harpist in the Salzedo Harp Ensemble throughout the U.S., and with her own Lawrence Harp Quintette on smaller engagements. She then married Salzedo, an event that was noted in the Minneapolis Journal, but they were later divorced in 1936. She subsequently married Paul Dahlstrom, a colleague from Radio City Music Hall, and they had a family together. She appeared as harp soloist with the Cleveland Orchestra, the Chicago Symphony, the Chamber Orchestra of Boston, the Conductorless Orchestra, the George Barrere Ensemble, the Coolidge Festival of Chamber Music, in duo-recital with Carlos Salzedo and in the New York Trio with Frances Blaisdell and Seymour Barab. She premiered Salzedo's Concerto for Harp and Seven Winds and recorded it as well. She later performed for several years in the symphony orchestra of Radio City Music Hall, and in the 1950s on television in the Firestone Orchestra. She was a sought-after orchestral harpist, turning down full-time positions with top orchestras (New York Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, Metropolitan Opera) to remain a free-lance artist and teacher. As such, she made many recordings under the baton of Leopold Stokowski. While she was married to Salzedo, they made a summer trip to Europe to fulfill concert engagements and met with Maurice Ravel. She recalled performing his Introduction et Allegro for him and receiving his instructions on how to perform it. Salzedo presented to Ravel his arrangement of the well-known Sonatina as a trio for flute, cello, and harp. They quoted Ravel's response as, 'Why didn't I think of that?' It was agreed that upon their return the next summer, Ravel would compose a harp concerto. The next year, Salzedo decided he needed to start a summer teaching center rather than make another trip to France, even though it meant foregoing the promise of a concerto for harp by Ravel. Instead, the Salzedos purchased a house in Camden, Maine, remodeled it with interior decoration by the renowned designer Jules Bouy, and launched the Salzedo Summer Harp Colony, which continued into the late 1990s. The harp solos in orchestral works by Ravel may provide a clue as to what kind of work he might have composed. Lawrence was a dedicated teacher for most of her life, an idealist and a pedagogue, publishing several methods and texts on harp as well as collections of music for performing. The Method for the Harp by Lawrence and Salzedo was her idea, to assist with teaching. In creating it, she created a powerful tool for learning through a modern approach and modern music, and the best description of Salzedo's influential teaching. This began a collaborative partnership of several books. The Salzedo Method, as it is referred to, is perhaps the most widely used harp method book of the 20th Century. It is a deliberate break, in some aspects, with the traditional French approach found in methods by contemporaries such as Renie. It is more of a leap directly from the popular Universal Method of Bochsa into the Modern age, bypassing the late-romantic period altogether. When Salzedo was invited to found the harp department of the newly formed Curtis Institute of Music, Florence Wightman was hired as his teaching assistant. When Wightman left to take the position of Principal Harp with the Cleveland Orchestra, Lawrence was hired in 1927 as Associate Instructor. As such, she taught the first-year students, who included such legendary harpists as Edna Phillips and Alice Chalifoux. When cutbacks due to the Depression caused her to be laid off in 1928, she was invited to found the Harp Department at the Philadelphia Musical Academy. She was so successful with her students there, as she put it, that after just two years, she was brought back, along with her best students, to the Curtis faculty where she remained until 1933, having become a competitive threat to Salzedo. Having joined Radio City's orchestra in 1932, her schedule was ultimately too heavy to continue traveling to Philadelphia to teach, so she resigned from the Curtis. She continued to teach privately, and joined the faculties of the Mannes College of Music, later Manhattan School of Music, and Boston University and its Tanglewood Harp Seminar. She also taught at the Longy School, Teacher's College of Columbia University, and gave master classes in Houston, San Jose, Denver, Michigan, Philadelphia (her last master class was held there in 2003) and many other locations. For many summers she taught 10 to 16 students of all ages at Tanglewood, giving an intensive 8-week learning experience of twice-weekly private lessons and weekly master classes. She served as the first president of the American Harp Society, and as a judge for the International Harp Contest in Israel, where her student Grace Wong was the highest-placed American winner (second prize). Her students have held many important orchestral and teaching positions and won many competitions. They are known for high musical and technical standards. Over the years, she taught such harpists as Cynthia Otis (formerly New York City Ballet Orchestra, Little Orchestra Society, Joffrey Ballet Orchestra), Beatrice Schroeder Rose (formerly Houston Symphony, faculties of Rice University, U. of Houston), Maria Pinckney (formerly St. Louis Symphony), Grace Wong (Israel contest prize-winner, Rochester Symphony), Sara Cutler (soloist, now NYC Ballet), Karen Thielen (Monterey Opera Orchestra, faculty San Jose State University and Santa Clara University), Susan Robinson (Kennedy Center Opera Orchestra, Ibis Chamber Music Society), Faye Seeman (Wheaton College, Northern Illinois University faculties), Jennifer Hoult, Elizabeth Richter (faculty, Ball State University), Susan Miron (Centaur recording artist), Jacquelyn Bartlett (Artist Faculty, University of North Carolina School of the Arts, FIRE PINK TRIO, formerly Indianapolis Symphony and North Carolina Symphony), Ray Pool, Saul Davis Zlatkovski (artistic director, Harp Festival of Philadelphia), Donald Hilsberg (Colorado Springs Symphony), Elizabeth Panzer (soloist), Ellen Ritscher Sackett (former North Texas State University faculty), Jim Pinkerton (soloist), Hank Whitmire, Beth Schwartz Robinson (formerly Pittsburgh Symphony, faculty Kean University), Lise Nadeau Harmon (New Jersey Symphony, other orchestras), Lois Colin, Emily Halpern Lewis (faculty, M.I.T.), Francziska Huhn (faculty, Longy Schoo, New England Conservatory and Tanglewood), Elizabeth Morse Feldman (Williams College), Carolyn Mills (New Zealand Symphony Orchestra) and hundreds of others with solo, teaching, orchestral or careers that combine all of the above. She also touched countless other harpists' lives as a coach, friend and adviser. Among her final students were Yu-Hsin Huang, a doctoral student at Boston University, and Helen Gerhold. Her former pupil, Franziska Huhn now teaches harp at Boston University, as well as New England Conservatory, the Longy School of Music, and at Tanglewood. She published with G. Schirmer the seminal texts Method for the Harp, ABC of Harp Playing and Art of Modulating, all with musical contributions by Carlos Salzedo, and Peer-Southern's Pathfinder to the Harp, with one study by Salzedo (\\"Conflict\\"), and other preludes composed by Miss Lawrence. She published her many editions of numerous solos, frequently with Lyra, and the ever-popular Solos for the Harp Player, which ranges from baroque to twentieth-century composers such as Alojz Srebotnjak and Rudolf Forst. She recorded a comprehensive two-LP recording of many works by Carlos Salzedo: his Prelude for a Drama, Five Preludes and Five Poetic Studies, along with Intrada by Josef Tal, and her monumental edition from manuscript of the Sonata for Harp by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach. She also collaborated with Carlos Salzedo on a Mercury LP recording of his most popular harp duos. She worked with many composers, including John Lessard, Rudolf Forst, Quinto Maganini, Charles Fox, George Perle, and perhaps most extensively, Ami Maayani. She edited several of his works for publication, though not always named on her editions. She published most frequently with Lyra and G. Schirmer. At the age of 93, she was still traveling to Boston University from her home in River Edge, New Jersey to teach her students.Rabinowitz, Nancy. \\"At 93, harpist still is treasured teacher, mentor\\", South Coast Today, October 22, 2000. Accessed December 15, 2013. \\"Even if that means hopping a bus near her home in River Edge, N.J., and making the four-hour, 200-mile trip to her students at Boston University, where she has been on the faculty of the School for the Arts for the past 36 years.\\" She was the leading exponent of the Salzedo Method, in fact its creator in writing the Method for the Harp, and a purist proponent of its aesthetics. Her teaching style was that of a master teacher, correcting technical faults and guiding interpretations. The influence of her education with Edgard Varese showed in how she viewed the sound in abstract fashion and sculpted it with a sense of chiaroscuro. She often referred to Michelangelo in her teaching. She ever sought to give harpists the finest qualities of artistic musicianship. She gave her last master class in Philadelphia in 2003, for the American Harp Society chapter there. At her death in 2004, Lawrence was still presenting new ideas on pieces she had taught for more than 50 years, and was ever searching for ways to improve harp playing, harp music, and its status in the world.

Following graduation he furthered his training in Prague, and afterwards became an assistant at the eye clinic at Konigsberg. In 1879 he became a \\"full professor\\" of ophthalmology at the University of Giessen, and in 1890 returned as a professor to the University of K√∂nigsberg. In 1892 he attained the chair of ophthalmology at the University of Halle, and in 1901 went to G√∂ttingen, where he was director of the newly founded University Eye Clinic. He retired in 1914, and was replaced at the G√∂ttingen eye clinic by his son Eugen. Von Hippel made contributions in his research of intraocular pressure, color blindness and near-sightedness, but is remembered for his pioneer work in lamellar keratoplasty. In 1886, he grafted a full-thickness cornea from a rabbit into the lamellar bed of a young female patient. After the operation the girl was able to count fingers at a distance of two meters, for a visual acuity of 20/200. He is also credited for the invention of a mechanized trephine for corneal procedures. This device became the prototype for trephines that are used in ophthalmology today. *Note: Arthur von Hippel is sometimes confused with his grandson Arthur Robert von Hippel (1898-2003), a German-American physicist.

It is native to Europe, but in the cooler areas of North America was widely used as a pasture grass until the 1940s. Although it has largely been replaced by soybeans and more palatable grasses, it still gets some use in poor soils. It was one of the grasses planted in areas disturbed by the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. It generally does well in response to fires, due to survival of rhizomes and seeds. It can be found in open woodland, rough grassland, hedgerows, roadsides and waste ground, and as a weed on arable land. This species is similar to Agrostis stolonifera, with the key difference being that the latter has stolons. In fact the two are sometimes treated as a single species, and it is not always clear precisely what an author means by Agrostis alba or Agrostis stolonifera. Many internet sources describe Agrostis capillaris as being the tallest of the bent species. However C E Hubbard describes its height as ranging from 10 to 70 cm high, whereas Agrostis gigantea is .

He enjoyed a long career on both club and international level, currently having the third longest international career in the history of the national team with nearly seventeen years. He played on the left side of the pitch, mainly as a left winger and inside left, but later in his career also as left midfielder and left back. Club career Born in The Hague, Matthijs Clavan started his club career with RVC Rijswijk before moving to ADO. At the age of 15, he acquired the nickname Mick, as his speed and cunning playing style drew comparisons with Mickey Mouse. Aside from his footballing skills, Clavan also showed a capricious character, such as when in 1951, while on military service, he insulted a sergeant and was convicted to two months in jail. In 1954, professionalism was introduced to Dutch football, which prompted Clavan to move to the newly formed \\"paid club\\" SHS. Here, he formed a successful partnership with fellow left-sided forward Bertus de Harder. In 1956, he returned to ADO, which also had begun to pay its players. During the 1956‚Äì57 season, he helped ADO to achieve promotion to the Eredivisie. He also helped them reach the final of the KNVB Cup in 1959. In 1962, he returned to SHS (later renamed Holland Sport), which was by then playing in the second division. He retired at the age of 37. International career On 26 May 1948, aged 19, Clavan made his debut for the Dutch national side, scoring once in a 2‚Äì1 away win against Norway. He was subsequently selected for the Dutch squad at that year's Summer Olympics, but did not make an appearance. By the end of 1950, he had gained 12 caps, but due to his fickle character, Clavan's international appearances became more scattered after that. He was selected for the 1952 Summer Olympics, where he played in the Netherlands' only match, a 1‚Äì5 defeat against Brazil. On 3 April 1957, Clavan gained his 24th cap in a 1‚Äì2 home defeat against West Germany. He would subsequently not be called up for more than five and a half years, until November 1962, when Elek Schwartz recalled Clavan, by now 33 years old and playing for a second tier club, for a European Championship qualifier against Switzerland. He helped the team win the home match 3‚Äì1. Almost two years later, in October 1964, Clavan was recalled again, this time for a World Championship qualifier against Albania. With him, the Netherlands won this away match 2‚Äì0. Clavan gained his final cap on 26 January 1965, aged 35, as a substitute for Klaas Nuninga in a 1‚Äì0 away win against Israel. In total, he earned 27 caps, in which he scored 7 goals. Clavan's international career lasted 16 years and 245 days, which makes him currently the footballer with the third longest Oranje career, after Abe Lenstra (19 years and 19 days) and Bertus de Harder (16 years and 363 days). Later life and death rightAfter retiring, Clavan managed amateur team Ooievaars. On 11 July 1983, he died as a result of a heart attack. He was 54 years old.

The Masters derivative of rugby league aimed to extend the playing, and officiating, life of people. In 2008, in the United Kingdom the Rugby Football League (RFL) noted that there were only 2,000 registered club players aged 30 or over. This illustrates how the physical nature of competitive rugby league lends itself to being a young person's sport. History Masters Rugby League started in New Zealand in 1992. Masters Rugby League in New Zealand has seen a growth in the number of teams since then as clubs became more aware of this grade. SPARC's Push Play campaign, promoting the benefits of physical activity has also had an impact.

Eligibility Participants must be aged over 35 and have retired from competitive rugby. Rule modifications Rugby league's Laws of the Game apply except for amendments made by the governing bodies. There are slight differences between those adopted in New Zealand and the United Kingdom and the rules operated in Australia but the general modifications are the same and aim to reduce the physicality of the game, with \\"Rough and over vigorous play\\" not being condoned, and to reduce the amount of running, for example the defence must only retreat 5 metres at the play-the-ball and there is no running from dummy half. Masters players are divided by age, this being signified through the use of different coloured shorts. Physical contact is restricted or removed in both attack and defence for individual players based on these colours. The younger players can tackle normally, if older players are involved in the tackle it may be completed by a two-handed hold or by a touch.

Hartha fielded competitive sides through the balance of the decade and on to the end of World War II in 1945. The team captured division titles in 1937 and 1938 and delivered a number of top three finishes. Those titles earned BC a place in the national playoffs, but they were unable to progress beyond the opening group stage. They also made appearances in play for the Tschammerpokal, predecessor to today's DFB-Pokal (German Cup), in 1935‚Äì39 and 1941, and sent a representative to the national team in 1939.Gr√ºne, Hardy (2001).

As the war overtook the country, play became more local in character and in 1944 BC became part of the Gauliga Chemnitz which collapsed early in the 1944‚Äì45 season. Following the war the former membership of BC was re-formed as Sportgemeinde Hartha which became part of the separate football competition that emerged in East Germany. The team was renamed BSG Industrie Hartha in 1949 and again in 1952 as BSG Fortschritt Hartha. From 1953 until 1958, BSG was part of the second tier DDR-Liga before slipping to the Bezirksliga Leipzig, where they played as an anonymous lower division side over the next three decades.

He was one of the most powerful feudal lords of Ky≈´sh≈´ and one of the first to allow trading with Europeans, particularly the Portuguese, through whom he amassed great profits in the import of western firearms. He was also an early host and patron to the Jesuits, who he hoped would help secure an increase in trade with the Portuguese and other European traders.Lach, Donald F. (1994) Asia in the Making of Europe. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 667.  Biography  After becoming lord of Hirado in 1543, the 14-year-old Takanobu was advised by Yasumasa Toyohisa. Toyohisa was a well-known samurai and cousin of the previous lord of Hirado and, under his guidance, the domains of the Koteda family were increased to include much of Ikitsuki, together with the islands of Takushima, Ojika, Noshima as well as the areas of Kasuga, Shishi and Iira in Hirado. That same year he became an ally of the powerful wak≈ç leader Wang Zhi, inviting him to live in Hirado and allowing his band to dominate the outlying islands off Ky≈´sh≈´.Brown, Delmer M. (1951) Money Economy in Medieval Japan: A Study in the Use of Coins. New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University Press. p. 28. During the 1550s, he was involved in a fierce rivalry with the rival ≈åmura clan, the Christian convert ≈åmura Sumitada, who also competed for Portuguese trade. This led to many armed conflicts, including one attempt at taking the Portuguese black ship in the Battle of Fukuda Bay by Takanobu. This rivalry lasted for over three decades, and long after Takanobu had retired, until ≈åmura eventually won out by ceding Nagasaki to the Jesuits in 1580, making it the Portuguese port of call henceforth. Although initially tolerant to the Kirishitan movement introduced to Japan (Takanobu welcomed Francis Xavier to Hirado in 1550 and his retainer Koteda Yasumasa converted to Catholicism in 1551), he expelled the Jesuits from his domain in 1558. The evangelism of the Jesuits' followers resulted in the destruction of three Buddhist temples, who then threw artifacts into the sea. A speech given by a Zen priest from Yasumandake spoke out against Father Gaspar Vilela and resulted in several mobs of Buddhist followers stoning the three churches in the area and, in one instance, toppling the cross from one church. This recent surge in religious violence forced Takanobu to ask Vilela to leave. He later forced Kato Saemon, lord of the district of Kato, into retirement in Nagasaki due to pressure from his brothers. In 1568, he stepped down in favor of his son Shigenobu. His great-grandson, baptized in 1591 and also named Matsura Takanobu, was the 3rd daimy≈ç of Hirado Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. Matsura Takanobu died in 1599.Turnbull, Stephen R.

Description Life restoration of Subdromomeryx antilopina Palaeomerycids were a group of horned, long-legged and massive ruminants that could attain a weight of . One of the first known members of this group, Palaeomeryx, was thought to be a hornless form distantly related to the Giraffidae before paleontologist Miguel Crusafont found remains of Triceromeryx in middle Miocene Spain. This Palaeomeryx-like form carried two ossicones over its orbits that were straight and short, similar to those of true giraffids. However, the most striking feature of Triceromeryx was the third, Y-shaped appendage that prolonged the occipital bone at the back of the skull. Discoveries during the 1980s and 1990s showed a surprising variety in these occipital appendages. Ampelomeryx, a genus of palaeomerycids found at the early Miocene site of Els Casots, Valles-Penedes Basin, Spain, had a three-horned system of appendages similar to those of Triceromeryx. These appendages were, however, quite different, with the paired appendages extending laterally over the orbits, flat and wide, forming an eye-shade, while the third spectacular posterior appendage was about long. Another species of Triceromeryx, T. conquensis found in La Retama in Spain, showed an even more spectacular appendage -- instead of a Y-shaped structure, its posterior appendage was T-shaped with the lateral branches expanding toward the front. In primitive members of the group (e.g. Ampelomeryx), this appendage was a posterior expansion of the occipital bone lying close to the powerful muscles supporting the skull in a normal position, thus suggesting that this appendage was actually used for fighting between males during the breeding season. The reduced shapes of the flat and laterally oriented appendages of later species suggests that these were not used in active fighting, instead forming a function of passive display. The limbs were more similar to those of modern large bovids (e.g. buffaloes) than to those of okapis. They probably lived in boggy forests, living on soft leaves and aquatic plants (as hinted to by the brachydont teeth, which are similar to those of primitive giraffids). As a group, the palaeomerycids appear to have formed a successful part of an independent radiation of horned ruminants that diversified into a variety of forms during the early to middle Miocene, with a geographic range reaching from Spain to China. The giraffids seem to have originated in Asia south of the Alpine belt, while the cervoids seem to have originated north of the Alpine belt. Taxonomy Xenokeryx restoration The Palaeomerycidae were named by Lydekker (1883). The type genus is Palaeomeryx. The family was assigned to the Artiodactyla by Hulbert and Whitmore (2006), and to Cervoidea by Carroll (1988), Sach and Heizmann (2001) and Prothero and Liter (2007).R. C. Hulbert and F. C.

His sole campaign promise led to a \\"hard fought\\" incorporation battle, because many residents feared that incorporation would result in higher taxes. However, Mayor Zimmerman held that an impending annexation would result in even higher taxes than incorporation, which instead would give the town some control over tax rates. The other major issue was that incorporation would force him out of his position as mayor, since Texas law stated that mayors of incorporated communities had to be at least 18 years of age. He nonetheless supported a referendum to incorporate the community, stating \\"The mayor isn't there to sit and worry about keeping his job. He's there to do what's best for the people.\\" Zimmerman's incorporation bid was ultimately unsuccessful, but he was reelected as mayor following the referendum.

They are also called mud pits, as they were once simple pits in the earth. Mud tank structure Mud tanks are divided into square tanks and cone-shaped tanks according to the shape difference of the tank bottom. The body of the tank is made by welding the steel plate and section, using the smooth cone-shape structure or the corrugated structure. The mud tank surface and passages are made of slip resistant steel plate and expanded steel plate. The mud tanks are made of the side steel pipe, all of the structure can be folded without barrier and pegged reliably. The surface of the tank is equipped with a water pipeline for cleaning the surface and equipment on the tank, it uses soaked zinc processing for the expanded steel plate. The ladder is made of channel steel to take responsibility the body, the foot board is made of expanded steel plate. The two-sided guard rails are installed the safe suspension hook. The mud tank is designed to be in a standard shanty to prevent the sand and the rain. The pipeline is installed in the tank to preserve the warm air heat. The tanks are generally open-top and have walkways on top to allow a worker to traverse and inspect the level of fluids in the tanks. The walkways also allow access to other equipment that is mounted on the top. Recently, offshore drilling rigs have closed-in tanks for safety. The mud tank plays a critical role in mechanically removing destructive solids and sediment from costly land and offshore drilling systems. A tank is sectioned off into different compartments. A compartment may include a settling tank, sometimes called a sand trap, to allow sand and other solids in the drilling fluid to precipitate before it flows into the next compartment. Other compartments may have agitators on the top, which have long impellers below inserting into the tank and stirring the fluids to prevent its contents from precipitating. And mud guns are often equipped at the corners of the tanks' top, spraying high-pressed mud to prevent the drilling fluids in the corner of the compartment from precipitating, typically for the square tanks. The piping linking the mud tanks/pits with the mud pumps is called the suction line. This may be gravity fed or charged by centrifugal pumps to provide additional volumetric efficiency to the mud pumps. The role of mud tank for solids control Mud tanks play an important role in a solids control system. It is the base of solids control equipment, and also the carrier of drilling fluids. Solids control equipment that are all mounted on the top of mud tanks include the following: *shale shaker *vacuum degasser *desander *desilter *centrifuge *mud agitator *Vertical slurry pump Drilling fluids flow into the shale shaker directly after it returns to the surface of the well, and the solids that are removed by the screen would be discharged out of the tank, and the drilling fluids with smaller solids would flow through the screen into mud tank for further purification. A centrifugal pump sucks the shaker-treated fluids up to the desilter or mud cleaner for further purification. And vertical slurry pump is used to pump the drilling fluids up to the centrifuge, and a mud pump would pump the drilling fluids from mud tank into the borehole after it is treated by centrifuge and the circulation system continues. The number of the mud tanks that are needed on the drilling rig depends on the depth of the well, and also the mud demands of drilling. Normally the shale shaker and vacuum degasser and desander are mounted together on the same mud tank as the first tank at the oilfield, while desilter and centrifuge on the second tank. Also, the drilling rig has other different tanks such as a reserve tank, emergency tank, etc. The classification of mud tank Mud tanks are an important part in the solids control system. Based on functions, mud tanks include metering tanks, circulating tanks, chemical tanks, aggravating tanks, precipitating tanks, storing tanks, etc. References Category:Drilling fluid ","title":"Mud tank"},{"id":"17999651","text":"Uilke Piebe \\"Oeki\\" Hoekema (born 28 January 1949) is a Dutch retired footballer who played for Go Ahead Eagles, PSV, De Graafschap, Lierse SK, ADO Den Haag and FC Wageningen, as well as the Dutch national side.

In total, reiterations account for 12.3 percent of its stemwood volume. Like many old growth redwoods, trunks within the crown are hydraulically linked by fused branches. In addition to allowing for water transfer within the crown, these fusions strengthen the crown of the tree, making it more resilient to wind damage. Iluvatar has 30 such fusions.

Comprising of rugged coastal canyons, open grassland, and riparian woodland, the park borders the suburban cities of Aliso Viejo, Dana Point, Laguna Beach, Laguna Hills and Laguna Niguel. Aliso and Wood Canyons is part of a larger park complex known as the South Coast Wilderness. Surrounded by heavy suburban development and the Pacific Ocean, it is an important regional wildlife preserve. The park includes trails for hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding; a greenbelt and bikeway along Aliso Creek; and various geological features such as caves, springs, and exposed marine fossil beds. The park is administered by the County of Orange under the OC Parks Department. The name Aliso originated in the 18th century when Spanish explorers named Aliso Creek, probably for the Alnus rhombifolia (white alder) tree native to the area. Wood Canyon was likely named for the groves of California live oak and sycamores that are found in the canyon. History The park was originally inhabited by the Acjachemen and Tongva Native Americans who used Aliso Creek as the boundary between their respective territories to the south and north. The relationship between the two tribes was mostly peaceful. Because Aliso Canyon was one of the few places in what is now south Orange County with perennial streams and springs ‚Äì as well as providing easy access from inland areas to the Pacific Ocean ‚Äì it was a major wintering spot for native peoples.http://ocparks.com/parks/aliso/history The Acjachemen village of Niguili was located in what is now the park, near the confluence of Aliso Creek and Sulphur Creek. The 1769 Spanish Portola expedition was the first European party to explore the area. Spanish ships were also known to anchor in the bay at the mouth of Aliso Canyon and sailors \\"harvested large timbers from the river area\\". In the following decades the Spanish colonized California they established missions to convert the Native Americans to Christianity with varying degrees of success. The peoples who once lived in Aliso Canyon were moved by the Spanish to the nearby Mission San Juan Capistrano. Aliso Canyon from near the summit of Niguel Hill, looking northward towards Temple Hill After Mexico's independence from Spain in 1821 the missions were secularized and mission lands were divided into private land grants. The Rancho Niguel, which included most of what is now the park, was granted to Juan Avila in 1842. After the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in 1850, California became part of the United States; after a severe drought Avila sold the ranch in 1865. Rancho Niguel changed hands multiple times until it was acquired by Lewis Moulton and Jean Pierre Daguerre in 1895. During the 19th century, others also took advantage of the shelter and seclusion offered by Aliso Canyon. Dripping Cave (once used by the local Native Americans as a shelter), tucked into a sheltered part of Wood Canyon, became a \\"base of operations\\" of outlaws, led by Juan Flores, who robbed stagecoaches traveling between Los Angeles and San Diego. Long after the bandits were arrested, it retains the nickname \\"Robbers Cave\\". In 1871 Eugene Salter, the first white settler along Aliso Creek, claimed in the canyon just outside the Rancho Niguel. The next year, the homestead was taken over by the Thurston family who irrigated an orchard using water from Aliso Creek. Aliso Canyon was used for sheep ranching through the first half of the 20th century, although tourism was also growing due to the popularity of Aliso Beach at canyon's end, and the establishment of the Aliso Creek Inn and Golf Course on the old Thurston property in 1950.https://www.theranchlb.com/ranch/history During the 1960s, the Rancho Niguel was sold for residential suburban development in the planned cities of Aliso Viejo, Laguna Hills and Laguna Niguel. The Aliso Canyon was the proposed location of a \\"much publicized national fitness center headed by former Los Angeles Rams coach George Allen.\\"https://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-26/local/me-96_1_regional-park/2 A six-lane highway was proposed to run the length of the canyon, to link inland communities with Laguna Beach. The canyon was spared from development when about 40 land parcels were acquired by the county for use as a park, the largest in 1979 when the Mission Viejo Company donated . The park officially opened on March 31, 1990 as Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park;https://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-26/local/me-96_1_regional-park it was later designated a Wilderness Park to better preserve native habitat. Continued land acquisitions and donations since then brought the park to its current size. Features and characteristics Trail map (click to enlarge) The park encompasses the dramatic Aliso Canyon, which is the valley formed by Aliso Creek as it slices through the San Joaquin Hills on its way from the Cleveland National Forest to the Pacific Ocean. Wood Canyon is formed by Wood Canyon Creek as it flows south to join Aliso Creek in the center of the park. Another tributary, Sulphur Creek, joins Aliso Creek at the eastern end of the park. Elevations within the park range from above sea level to at Temple Hill in Laguna Beach (colloquially \\"Top of the World\\"), on the park's western boundary. On a clear day, most of Orange County can be seen from Temple Hill and the other ridge tops surrounding Aliso Canyon. Aliso and Wood Canyons links two major park systems in Orange County. The South Coast Wilderness, which protects much of the San Joaquin Hills ecosystem, includes Laguna Coast Wilderness Park which borders Aliso and Wood Canyons to the north. The Aliso Creek Corridor, a greenbelt stretching along Aliso Creek to national forest lands in the Santa Ana Mountains, also terminates in Aliso Canyon.http://scc.ca.gov/webmaster/ftp/pdf/sccbb/2013/1306/20130620Board09_Aliso_and_Wood_Canyons_Public_Access.pdf Aliso and Wood Canyons very nearly touches the popular Aliso Beach County Park on its southern end; however, the two are separated by the private Ranch at Laguna Beach (formerly Aliso Creek Inn and Golf Course), preventing visitors from accessing the beach using park trails. A plan to extend a public trail through this property was indefinitely suspended in 2009 after the global financial crisis. The park contains a large number of artifacts from past inhabitants of the area. Many types of these prehistoric artifacts are found throughout the park. These include, but are not limited to, open air shell middens, rock shelters, stone tools, and their production sites. There is also historic farm equipment and buildings dating from the Rancho Niguel period. Such historical sites include the Moulton Cement Plant, Bacon House site, and Tischler Rock. =Climate= The park has a warm, dry Mediterranean climate, with mild winters and hot summers. Most of the annual rainfall occurs between December and March. The average annual precipitation is . =Trails and access= The park is open from 7 AM to sunset. The main entrance and parking are located off Alicia Parkway at AWMA Road in Laguna Niguel. There is no entrance fee, but a $3 fee applies for parking.http://ocparks.com/parks/aliso/ About of recreational trails wind through the park.http://ocparks.com/parks/aliso/amenities The most prominent include the paved Aliso Creek Trail, which travels the length of the park, and the unpaved Wood Canyon Trail which terminates at Canyon View Park in Aliso Viejo. The Aliso Creek Trail continues north along the creek towards Laguna Hills as a paved walking/biking path. The more enclosed and shaded Wood Canyon is a popular location for horseback riding; the hills bordering Wood Canyon include many mountain biking paths, such as the Mathis Canyon and Rock-It trails, ranging in difficulty from beginner to advanced. Dripping Cave is a popular beginner's hike and was once used as a hideout by local cattle and stagecoach thieves during the 1800s. The Aliso Summit and West Ridge trails hug the ridge lines on the park's eastern and western boundaries, respectively.http://www.ocregister.com/articles/trail-314323-top-canyon.html Geology Aliso Canyon began forming about 1.2 million years ago, as Aliso Creek carved its way through the hills at the same time the hills experienced geological uplift. During the pluvial Ice Age, ending about 10,000 years ago, Orange County had a much wetter climate and sea levels were lower; the valley is a relic of a time when much more water flowed through Aliso Creek as it cut its way to the sea. At the end of the Ice Age sea levels rose, backfilling the canyon and creating a shallow fjord. Sediment deposited by Aliso Creek slowly filled the canyon to depths of and created the flat valley floor seen today. The creek remains as an underfit stream whose present size, in today's semiarid climate, appears too small to have cut the canyon through which it flows. The San Joaquin Hills consist of marine sedimentary rock that originally lay at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean before being uplifted above sea level. As the creek cut through the hills it exposed strata of the Monterey Formation dating to the Miocene (5-23 million years ago) and the Eocene (34‚Äì56 million years ago). Limestone outcrops in the northeast section of the park, part of the Pecten Reef, have yielded thousands of fossils including Miocene dolphin and whales,http://lagunacanyon.org/wp- content/uploads/2015/05/Aliso-Wood-Canyon_Web-Brochure.pdf preserved invertebrates, plankton, bryozoa, and red, blue and brown algae. Much of the scientific understanding for evolution, paleoenvironments and paleoclimates during the Miocene period in Orange County is based on the specimens collected from the Pecten Reef. Ecology The plant and animal species in the park are split between three major plant communities covering approximately equal acreage within the park. These are coastal sage scrub, chaparral, and annual grassland. Chaparral often co-exists with sage scrub on the hills and slopes of the park; mostly in the southern extreme of the park. The grassland covers the valley floor, with riparian zones along the park's perennial streams. The park, a designated wildlife sanctuary, protects the habitat of 137 species of nesting and migratory birds. =Plants= Hummingbird sage is native to southern California and flourishes in the park. The Aliso Canyon bottom is seasonal grassland, which flourishes in spring and diminishes by late summer or fall. The park protects habitat for a number of sensitive plant species, including many-stemmed dudleya, Pomona rattleweed, Orange County Turkish rugging, Palmer's grapplinghook, aphanisma, Laguna Beach dudleya, scrub oak, western dichondra, hummingbird sage, ocean spray, and crown-beard. Oak and sycamore are found in Wood Canyon, and marshes and grassy wetlands are found along Aliso Creek. Native grassland ecosystems in the less visited south- western portion of the park are considered largely intact. =Animals= The California gnatcatcher inhabits undergrowth throughout the park. The park is one of the largest sanctuaries in coastal Orange County for mammals such as coyotes and bobcats. Several sensitive bird, small mammal, and reptile species find refuge in the park, including California gnatcatcher, pond turtle, San Diego horned lizard, orange-throated whiptail, Pacific pocket mouse, great egret, white-tailed kite, northern harrier, sharp-shinned hawk, Cooper's hawk, ferruginous hawk, cactus wren, yellow warbler, and yellow-breasted chat. Up to five bald eagles have been counted in Aliso Canyon, and peregrine falcons have been sighted flying along the canyon walls. =Fish= Aliso Creek was formerly a major steelhead stream. Dam construction, upstream channelization, pollution, invasive plant species such as giant reed, as well as severe erosion problems that have in some places undermined the Aliso Creek Trail, have essentially eliminated steelhead with only occasional anecdotal sightings. Near the mouth, there was also a large population of tidewater goby (an endemic species to California) which have largely disappeared with human development. Carp of up to 18 inches (1.5 feet, 45 cm) have been taken from the creek; they are among the few fish species that thrive in the warm, silty and nutrient-rich waters. Environmental issues Among the most long-running problems afflicting Aliso and Wood Canyons is the presence of invasive species, many introduced by former ranching activities, and later, exotic ornamental plants imported for gardens. Plants such as giant reed (Arundo donax) and pampas grass crowd out native vegetation and provide less nutritional value to animals that frequent the park. Giant reed in particular has invaded many riparian zones along Aliso Creek and reduced the biodiversity of these habitats. There are also numerous invasive animal species, including the Brown-headed cowbird, a brood parasite which lays its eggs in native birds' nests. Recent mitigation projects have utilized herbicides and trapping to reduce the population of invasive species within the canyon.http://occonservation.org/wp-content/uploads/mdocs/2015annualreport.pdf Another issue affecting the park are hikers and mountain bikers who create unauthorized trails as shortcuts. Even before the opening of the park in 1990, motorcyclists would frequently trespass inside the boundaries, damaging sensitive habitat and slopes; in part because of this, motorized vehicles with the exception of maintenance and emergency workers are banned in the park. Rangers regularly block and re-plant unofficial trails, and visitors are urged to stay on the designated trails to prevent erosion.http://www.ocregister.com/articles/park-541344-trail-mountain.html =Erosion= Sign in Aliso and Wood Canyons Park The Aliso Wastewater Management Agency (AWMA) was created in 1974 to reclaim domestic sewage for irrigation; a water treatment facility was established inside the future park as the overflow into Aliso Creek when the volume of reclaimed water exceeds demand in nearby cities. Since then, the population of south Orange County has grown faster than projected, increasing the volume of wastewater entering Aliso Creek and causing erosion problems inside the park. In the 1990s Orange County and the Mission Viejo Company constructed a dam on Aliso Creek inside the park, which was intended to control erosion and help restore riparian habitat. About 10,000 trees were planted to enhance habitat conditions. This project was known as the Aliso Creek Wildlife Habitat Enhancement Project (ACWHEP). However, after flooding damages in 1997-98 the dam was severely damaged, and has led to significant degradation of the river bed such that the creek now flows in a gully below the surrounding land. This has caused further environmental problems along the creek, and dried up former riparian habitat and wetlands. Further efforts to control erosion along the creek in the park, both to restore habitat and protect nearby waste-water pipelines,https://www.socwa.com/Planning/documents/LowerAlisoCreekErosionAssessmentSOCWAFINAL_041912.pdf have been controversial as they would severely impact the existing habitat in the canyon. A 2008 proposal by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, would have \\"locked\\" the creek in place by building 20 drop structures and underground concrete walls to counter channel migration. The works would have involved moving as much as of earth and affected of the park. In 2009 a study submitted to the City of Laguna Beach suggested that the creek should be allowed to reach natural equilibrium with its surroundings, as additional human interference would likely lead to further unexpected damages.http://www.villagelaguna.org/channelizing-aliso-creek/ Due to environmental concerns, no such project has been attempted to date.

A mud pump is an important part of the equipment used for oil well drilling. ClassificationAccording to the acting type= Mud pumps can be divided into single-acting pump and double-acting pump according to the completion times of the suction and drainage acting in one cycle of the piston's reciprocating motion. =According to the quantity of liners (piston/plunger)= Mud pumps come in a variety of sizes and configurations but for the typical petroleum drilling rig, the triplex (three piston/plunger) mud pump is the pump of choice. Duplex mud pumps (two piston/plungers) have generally been replaced by the triplex pump, but are still common in developing countries. Two later developments are the hex pump with six vertical pistons/plungers, and various quintuplex's with five horizontal piston/plungers. The advantages that these new pumps have over convention triplex pumps is a lower mud noise which assists with better Measurement while drilling (MWD) and Logging while drilling (LWD) decoding. Composition The \\"normal\\" mud pump consists of two main sub-assemblies, the fluid end and the power end. =Fluid End= The fluid end produces the pumping process with valves, pistons, and liners. Because these components are high-wear items, modern pumps are designed to allow quick replacement of these parts. To reduce severe vibration caused by the pumping process, these pumps incorporate both a suction and discharge pulsation dampener. These are connected to the inlet and outlet of the fluid end. =Power End= The power end converts the rotation of the drive shaft to the reciprocating motion of the pistons. In most cases a crosshead crank gear is used for this. =Mud pump parts= A mud pump is composed of many parts including mud pump liner, mud pump piston, modules, hydraulic seat pullers, and other parts. Parts of a mud pump: 1\\\\. housing itself, 2\\\\. liner with packing, 3\\\\. cover plus packing, 4\\\\. piston and piston rod, 5\\\\. suction valve and discharge valve with their seats, 6\\\\. stuffing box (only in double-acting pumps), 7\\\\. gland (only in double-acting pumps), 8\\\\. pulsation dampener. Performance Parameters There are two main parameters to measure the performance of a mud pump: Displacement and Pressure.. =Displacement= Displacement is calculated as discharged liters per minute, it is related with the drilling hole diameter and the return speed of drilling fluid from the bottom of the hole, i.e. the larger the diameter of drilling hole, the larger the desired displacement. The return speed of drilling fluid should reach the requirement that can wash away the debris and rock powder cut by the drill from the bottom of the hole in a timely manner, and reliably carry them to the earth surface. When drilling geological core, the speed is generally in range of 0.4 to 1.0 m^3/min. =Pressure= The pressure size of the pump depends on the depth of the drilling hole, the resistance of flushing fluid (drilling fluid) through the channel, as well as the nature of the conveying drilling fluid. The deeper the drilling hole and the greater the pipeline resistance, the higher the pressure needed. With the changes of drilling hole diameter and depth, it requires that the displacement of the pump can be adjusted accordingly. In the mud pump mechanism, the gearbox or hydraulic motor is equipped to adjust its speed and displacement. In order to accurately grasp the changes in pressure and displacement, a flow meter and pressure gauge are installed in the mud pump. Characteristics # The structure is simple and easy for disassembly and maintenance, # smooth operation, small vibration and low noise, # it can deliver high concentration and high viscosity (less than 10000 PaS) suspended slurry, # the drilling fluid flow is stable, no overcurrent, pulsation and stirred, shear slurry phenomena, # the discharge pressure has nothing to do with the speed, low flow can also maintain a high discharge pressure, # displacement is proportional to the speed, by shifting mechanism or motor, one can adjust the displacement, # it has high self-absorption ability, and can suck liquid directly without bottom valve. Maintenance The construction department should have a special maintenance worker that is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the machine. mud pumps and other mechanical equipment should be inspected and maintained on a scheduled and timely basis to find and address problems ahead of time, in order to avoid unscheduled shutdown. The worker should attend to the size of the sediment particles; when finding large particles, the mud pump wearing parts should frequently be checked for repairing needs or replacement. The wearing parts for mud pumps include pump casing, bearings, impeller, piston, liner, etc. Advanced antiwear measures should be adopted to increase the service life of the wearing parts, which can reduce the investment cost of the project, and improve production efficiency. At the same time, wearing parts and other mud pump parts should be repaired rather than replaced when possible.

It provided volunteers to the Imperial Yeomanry during the Second Boer War and formed three regiments for service during World War I. It was broken up and converted to infantry and artillery in 1920. Napoleonic Wars During the French Revolutionary Wars of the 1790s a number of English and Welsh counties formed units of Yeomanry Cavalry and Volunteer Infantry for home defence and internal security duties. Further units were formed after the Napoleonic Wars broke out in 1803, including the Montgomeryshire Volunteer Legion, raised in the Welsh county of Montgomeryshire. This consisted of four combined cavalry and infantry Troops, at Montgomery, Welshpool, Newtown and Abermule. The infantry element of the legion was short-lived, and after they had been disbanded the unit was renamed the Montgomeryshire Yeomanry Cavalry. Further troops were raised at Berriew (1813), Llangedwyn and Llanfyllin (both 1819). 19th Century Like many other Yeomanry regiments, the Montgomeryshire was disbanded in 1828 when the government withdrew payment for drills and periods of service. However, when this pay was restored in 1831 the regiment was reformed with its four original troops. Others were added and disbanded at various times during the century at Llangedwyn, Llanfyllin, and Caersws, with the regimental headquarters (RHQ) at Welshpool. The Caersws Troop was disbanded in 1889, and the six remaining Troops reorganised as three Squadrons in 1893.Army List, various dates. The Commanding Officer (CO) from 26 January 1844 was Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 6th Baronet of Wynnstay, a former officer in the 1st Life Guards (as were a number of the regiment's officers). He was simultaneously Lt-Col of the st Denbighshire Rifle Volunteer Corps. Williams-Wynn retired in 1877 and became the regiment's Honorary Colonel.Williams-Wynn Baronets, Burkes. He was succeeded in command by his nephew, Sir William Granville Williams, 4th Baronet of Bodelwyddan,Williams Baronets, Burkes. who in turn was followed on 2 February 1889 by his cousin, Sir Herbert Williams-Wynn, 7th Baronet of Wynnstay. Sir Herbert was awarded a CB in 1902London Gazette, 26 June 1902. By 1899 the Montgomeryshire Yeomanry and the Denbighshire Hussars together constituted the 15th Yeomanry Brigade. Imperial Yeomanry Following a string of defeats during Black Week in early December 1899, the British government realised that it would need more troops than just the regular army to fight the Second Boer War, particularly mounted troops. On 13 December, the War Office decided to allow volunteer forces to serve in the field, and a Royal Warrant was issued on 24 December that officially created the Imperial Yeomanry (IY). The Royal Warrant asked standing Yeomanry regiments to provide service companies of approximately 115 men each for one year. In addition to this, many British citizens (usually mid-upper class) volunteered to join the new force.Rogers, p. 228.Spiers, p. 239.Dunlop, pp. 104‚Äì18.IY at Anglo-Boer War The Montgomeryshire Yeomanry raised two companies for the first contingent of the IY, which both landed in South Africa on 6 April 1900 and served with other Welsh Yeomanry companies in the 9th Battalion, IY:IY Companies at Roll of Honour.Amery (1909), Appendix to Chapters I-XIV, pp. 503‚Äì14.

The concept was considered a success and before the war ended the existing Yeomanry regiments at home were converted into Imperial Yeomanry, with an establishment of HQ and four squadrons with a machine gun section. This included the Montgomeryshire Imperial Yeomanry, which raised an additional squadron at Rhayader. In 1906 Major Robert Williams-Wynn, DSO, was promoted to command the regiment in succession to his brother, who became its Honorary Colonel the following year.

It formed part of the South Wales Mounted Brigade, which assembled at Hereford. In accordance with the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw. 7, c.9) which brought the Territorial Force into being, the TF was intended to be a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, many members volunteered for Imperial Service. Therefore, TF units were split in August and September 1914 into 1st Line (liable for overseas service) and 2nd Line (home service for those unable or unwilling to serve overseas) units. Later, a 3rd Line was formed to act as a reserve, providing trained replacements for the 1st and 2nd Line regiments. = 1/1st Montgomeryshire Yeomanry= The 1/1st Montgomeryshire Yeomanry moved with the South Wales Mounted Brigade to Thetford in Norfolk by the end of August 1914. That month the brigade joined the 1st Mounted Division, replacing 1st South Midland Mounted Brigade which moved to 2nd Mounted Division. In November 1915, the brigade was dismounted. It was replaced in 1st Mounted Division by 2/1st Eastern Mounted Brigade when it departed for Egypt. With the brigade, the regiment was posted to Egypt in March 1916. On 20 March, South Wales Mounted Brigade was absorbed into the 4th Dismounted Brigade (along with the Welsh Border Mounted Brigade). In March 1917 they were re-roled as infantry and together with the Welsh Horse Yeomanry were converted into the 25th (Montgomery and Welsh Horse Yeomanry) Battalion, Royal Welsh Fusiliers. They joined 231st Brigade in the 74th (Yeomanry) Division. In May 1918, the Division moved to France, and the battalion saw action on the Western Front.Montgomeryshire Yeomanry at Long, Long Trail. = 2/1st Montgomeryshire Yeomanry= The 2nd Line regiment was formed at Welshpool in September 1914. In July 1915 it joined 2/1st South Wales Mounted Brigade at Dorchester. In September 1915 it moved to Southwold and the brigade joined 1st Mounted Division. On 31 March 1916, the remaining Mounted Brigades were ordered to be numbered in a single sequence and the brigade was numbered as 4th Mounted Brigade. In April 1916, the regiment went to Rendlesham with the brigade. About this time it absorbed the 2/1st Welsh Horse Yeomanry. In July 1916 it moved to Thornton Park near Brentwood and joined 2nd Mounted Brigade in the new 1st Mounted Division. In October 1916 it became a cyclist unit, amalgamating with the 2/1st Denbighshire Hussars to form the 3rd (Denbigh and Montgomery) Yeomanry Cyclist Regiment in the 1st Cyclist Brigade at Worlingham near Beccles. In March 1917 it resumed its identity as 2/1st Montgomeryshire Yeomanry, still with the 1st Cyclist Brigade, still at Worlingham. By November 1917 it was at Gorleston where it remained until the end of the war. = 3/1st Montgomeryshire Yeomanry= The 3rd Line regiment was formed in June 1915 at Welshpool. In July it was at Brecon and then it was affiliated to the 6th Reserve Cavalry Regiment at The Curragh. In June 1916 it was dismounted and attached to the 3rd Line Groups of the Welsh Division at Gobowen as its 1st Line was serving as infantry. The regiment was disbanded in January 1917 with personnel transferring to the 2nd Line regiment or to the 4th (Reserve) Battalion of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers at Oswestry. Postwar Wartime experience had proved that there were too many mounted units, and when the TF was reconstituted as the Territorial Army (TA), only the 14 most senior Yeomanry regiments were retained as horsed cavalry, the remainder being converted to other roles. The Welsh Horse Yeomanry had only been raised on 18 August 1914 and had been absorbed by the Montgomeryshire Yeomanry in 1917; it was never reformed. One squadron of the Montgomeryshire Yeomanry combined with a company of the 1st Battalion, Herefordshire Regiment to form 332 (Radnorshire) Field Battery (Howitzers) at Llandrindod Wells, Radnorshire, as part of 83rd (Welsh) Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, while the rest of the regiment formed two companies in 7th (Merioneth and Montgomeryshire) Battalion, Royal Welsh Fusiliers on 3 March 1920, and the yeomanry linage was discontinued.Litchfield, pp. 181‚Äì2.

The same year, a live version of the song was released on Live/Dead, their first concert album. Unlike the studio version, live versions usually included a section of the song called the \\"William Tell Bridge\\", which was used to segue into \\"The Eleven\\". After being played frequently in live concerts from the late 1960s to the early 1970s, the song fell out of regular performance; subsequent live performances of St. Stephen were thus considered a special event by deadheads. The song makes reference to the last days and trial of the 1st century AD saint, Stephen, the first martyr of the New Testament of the Bible, who was stoned to death (Acts 7:54-60).

The Durham, p. 149-150 creek drains in parts of the cities of Laguna Niguel, Dana Point, and San Juan Capistrano. The mostly channelized creek has no named surface tributaries. The creek begins in the central portion of the city of Laguna Niguel and flows west and south through a narrow canyon referred to as the Salt Creek Corridor, which is mostly inside a long and narrow regional park. It then flows into the Monarch Beach Golf Course in the city of Dana Point and enters a subsurface storm channel (\\"Arroyo Salada Storm Channel\\") which carries it to its discharge point at Salt Creek County Beach. Name Salt Creek's name originates from when Spanish explorers named the creek \\"Arroyo Salado\\" (Spanish: \\"Salt Creek\\"). The name given to the creek by the indigenous people has been lost. Course Salt Creek begins in a series of small canyons west of the Street of the Golden Lantern, an arterial roadway that connects with Dana Point at the south end. The canyon the creek begins in is protected as part of the Salt Creek Corridor Regional Park, which covers most of the creek's course. The creek winds west through the narrow gorge, picking up runoff from numerous residential communities both north and south of the Salt Creek Canyon. Just before it crosses beneath Niguel Road, which also runs in a north-south direction, it receives runoff from a large storm drain on the right bank; this drains much of the small valley to the north of the Salt Creek Canyon. Niguel Road crosses Salt Creek on an earthfill structure about high as Salt Creek is diverted beneath it in a concrete culvert. Turning southwest, the creek winds alongside Niguel Road, continuing to flow through a canyon that is not developed but is heavily modified to prevent erosion, especially on the northwest slopes. At this point, the Salt Creek Trail begins to parallel the creek, and continues to the mouth. Upstream of Camino del Avion, which runs east-west, it again enters a concrete pipe and is carried underneath the road to a small pond. Like Niguel Road, Camino del Avion crosses on an earthfill, not a bridge, except for a small section on the southwest which allows the Salt Creek Trail and floodwaters to pass underneath. The creek receives the water of a large, south-flowing tributary on the right bank; this tributary is now diverted into culverts and called the Arroyo Salada Storm Channel. It is speculated that Sulphur Creek, a tributary of Aliso Creek to the north, originally flowed into this creek, and as a result was a tributary of Salt Creek. Flowing through a golf course in a small canyon near the Pacific, several canyons join the Salt Creek Canyon on the left bank, then Salt Creek is diverted into a massive concrete culvert that takes it underground through the original course of a canyon that is now filled in. The culvert discharges onto a concrete apron at Salt Creek Beach, where Salt Creek is treated before it enters the sea. Watershed At in size, the watershed of Salt Creek is the smallest major watershed in the county. Shaped roughly like a \\"Y\\", the two arms of the mostly residential watershed represent the drainage basins of Salt Creek and its major tributary, the Arroyo Salada Storm Channel. Bounded almost entirely by the San Joaquin Hills, the watershed consists of a hilly region east of the Aliso Creek watershed, south of the Sulphur Creek drainage basin, and west of the valley of San Juan Creek and Trabuco Creek. The easternmost part of the watershed lies within San Juan Capistrano, and the southernmost part between Dana Point and Laguna Beach. Two-thirds of the watershed lies within the city of Laguna Niguel. If not for the uplift of the San Joaquin Hills approximately 1.2 million years ago, the Salt Creek watershed may have a different geography altogether. The unnamed tributary that now is diverted into the Arroyo Salada Storm Channel was once part of the course of Sulphur Creek, a tributary of Aliso Creek to the north. The historic creek had a length of around , far longer than the present-day mainstem of Salt Creek. At that time, the Sulphur Creek-Arroyo Salada combination would have represented the mainstem of the Salt Creek watershed, draining southward towards the Pacific, and would have added over to the Salt Creek watershed. A low saddle now divides the two drainage basins. Effects of Channelization Salt Creek just before it is diverted into the culvert near its mouth Due to channelization during urban development, the source of Salt Creek, which was a small marshy wetland but has been replaced by a community pool, is no longer where it was before the area was developed in the 1990s. At that point, The flow of Salt Creek is channeled into storm drain K01P07, which ends about 1/2 mile to the northeast of the original source at 33.52508, -117.68814. The various storm drains and the obliteration of the original source have in effect moved the source to an area completely under the street of Marina Hills. In addition, the flow of the stream is almost entirely urban runoff during dry seasons. This is evidenced by a constant annual flow, albeit low, which is low in life and the fact that it is choked with stringy algae, the growth of which is stimulated by nitrates from yard fertilizer. Also as a result of this intense channelization, Salt Creek has no surface tributaries and is inhospitable for all but the smallest mosquito fish and tadpoles. Oftentimes, there are soap suds visible on the water's surface, originating from the many residential and commercial entities in the watershed.Individual research History Like other Orange County creeks south of Aliso Creek and north of San Mateo Creek, the Salt Creek watershed was once part of the territory of the nomadic Acjachemen Native American group, which was later renamed the Juane√±o by Spanish missionaries when they founded Mission San Juan Capistrano at the confluence of San Juan and Trabuco Creeks farther south, close to the group's main population center. It is possible that Juane√±o villages once were located along the lower channel of Salt Creek, as springs feeding the creek provided a small but stable year round flow. By the 1960s, residential development had filled most of the available land within the Salt Creek watershed. Mountaintops were flattened and dumped into small canyons to create level land for tract housing and roads. Despite that, the Salt Creek Canyon remained relatively undeveloped, except for a golf course - the Monarch Beach Golf Links - at its southern end, and a golf course surrounding the Arroyo Salada Storm Channel's mainstem. As recently as the 1970s, the lowermost stretch of the Salt Creek Canyon was still in existence. This part of the canyon was also destroyed by landfill for the purpose of building more houses and the Pacific Coast Highway. Pollution and treatment The Salt Creek watershed is heavily developed, and as a result, it has been heavily impacted by polluted urban runoff. Prior to the construction of the Salt Creek Ozone Treatment Plant in 2004, at least flowed freely into the ocean, which caused a toxic plume of pollutants to drift south along the county beach and warrant its frequent closure. The $6.7 million USD facility treats the runoff with ozonation and releases it into the ocean, removing toxins, bacteria, garbage, polluted sediments, and other harmful substances. In effect the plant sterilizes the water, making it safe for contact, although not safe to drink.

Players have a large amount of control over their nation, although this varies based on the form of government the player's nation has. The English version was released on July 25, 2008, and has also been released in French, German, Spanish and Russian versions. The French version has been named Mission-Pr√©sident.https://www.amazon.com/Mission-Pr%C3%A9sident- Geopolitical-Simulator-French-Pc/dp/B0031MC40I Gameplay When starting a new game, players may choose between various scenarios, some of which have set objectives while others are more akin to a \\"sandbox\\" mode. Similarly to other government simulation games like Democracy, the player assumes the role of the chief executive of their chosen nation such as the President of the United States of America or the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Unlike in the Democracy series the player may amend the constitution of their chosen state and run it as a dictatorship. Inaccuracies The game refers to the position of chief executive as \\"Head of State\\" which is not true for all states‚Äîfor example, the President of the United States is the Head of State, but the British Prime Minister or German Chancellor are not‚Äîand in the game, the player plays as the chief executive. In many states there is a distinction between the Head of Government and the Head of State, with the Head of State often being a ceremonial president or monarch. There is also no distinction in the game between any upper and lower houses of the parliament. There are also inaccuracies relating to nations in the game, as many nations are misrepresented. For example, the Finnish are inaccurately portrayed as being culturally Scandinavian, all Finnish have Swedish names when Swedish speakers only constitute 5.5% of the population. Other inaccuracies relate to the religion. Certain minority religions, such as the Baha'i faith in India, are not represented in the game, nor are pagans of any kind. There are also mistakes relating to ethnicity. For example, all the people of Kyrgyzstan, as opposed to a sizable minority, are represented as being Caucasian rather than east Asian and also all have Russian names. Similarly, most Filipinos have Indian names.  Reception  The game received mixed to negative reviews.

Rising to a height of and 42 floors in Downtown Tampa, the structure currently stands as the tallest building in Tampa and the twenty-sixth-tallest building in Florida. 100 North Tampa was designed by the HKS, Inc. architectural firm, headquartered in Dallas, Texas. The building, an example of postmodern architecture, holds offices for Regions Bank, the American International Group, Yara, North America, KPMG, and law firm Holland & Knight. History 100 North Tampa began construction after a groundbreaking ceremony in May 1990, and was completed and opened in June 1992. Civil Engineering and Surveying for the structure was completed by John Herrick, PE, PLS of Greiner Engineering. The building was designed as the Citizens and Southern Bank Plaza, but opened in 1992 as the AmSouth Building after its primary tenant, AmSouth Bancorporation. AmSouth merged with Regions Bank on May 25, 2005, and the building was renamed the Regions Building. However, shortly thereafter, the building's owners adopted its street address as the structure's official name. The building was originally owned and developed by Plaza IV Associates; American International Group, a member of the ownership group, originally held interest in the office tower. The building was sold by AIG to the Newark, New Jersey-based Prudential Financial in a record-breaking entity sale that took place in late June 2007. While the full details of the deal, including the final price that 100 North Tampa sold at, were never released, investors estimate that Prudential purchased the building for up to US$275 per . At this price, the building would have been sold for a final price of $150 million, a record price for a premium, Class A office tower in Tampa. The deal was brokered by the CB Richard Ellis Group. Height Rising to a height of , 100 North Tampa stands as the tallest building in Tampa. The 42-story tower also stands as the tallest building in the state of Florida outside Miami and Jacksonville and the tallest structure along Florida's Gulf Coast. 100 North Tampa is overall the ninth-tallest building in Florida. In 2006, it was announced that a new construction project, Trump Tower Tampa, would surpass 100 North Tampa to become Tampa's tallest building, relegating the former Regions Building to second place in the city's high-rise rank. Trump Tower, which was expected to rise to a height of and 52 floors, began construction in mid-2006. However, the building's construction was halted in September 2006 when instabilities were found in the construction site's soil. Trump Tower Tampa was ultimately canceled due to lack of buyers in a slowing real estate market. Design 100 North Tampa is composed of a pewter-tinted glass and Spanish Rosa Dante granite fa√ßade. The former AmSouth Building is an example of postmodern architecture; postmodern aspects of the building include its Gothic-style roof, granite cornices, prominent setbacks at the levels of the 38th and 40th floors, and granite arches at the two entrances.

It was formerly classified in the family Cuscutaceae. It is native to central North America. It is a parasite of a wide range of herbaceous plants. It is a pest of lucerne and other legumes. It has become a widespread weed in many countries. It is known as 'golden dodder' in Australia. It has been confused in some recent literature with Cuscuta pentagona Engelmann, but the differences between the two species are clear. Remarkably, the seeds of the plant have been found to become dispersed by waterfowl in significant numbers. 4 Lifestyle Parasitic plants of the genus Cuscuta have little to no chlorophyll making them unable to undergo photosynthesis, a process by which plants make their own food. This makes them photosynthetically inactive. Cuscuta species are thus referred to as holoparasitic plants, as they depend on their host plant for nutrients. About 10-15 species of Cuscuta, out of the known 200, are considered agricultural weeds which wrap their vines around their hosts and obtain their nutrients from them through their extensions called haustoria. This mechanism for obtaining their food makes them very difficult to remove. Their growth has been cited to cause severe loss to crops that yield alfalfa, tomatoes, carrots and cranberry crops. The life cycle of the Cuscuta starts with seed germination. The seedlings cannot survive for long periods of time hence, they find the appropriate plant stem by recognizing plant chemo-attractants. Cuscuta campestris is known for restraining the growth of their host plants and even inhibiting their flowering. This causes the host cell to eventually die.Ashton and Santana, 1976; Cooke and Black, 1987; Dawson et al., 1994 This mechanism gives them the ability to control other populations of weeds like Mikania micrantha. Another mechanism by which these dodders recognize which plants to use as hosts depends on the light that's reflected off the plant's surface. Cuscuta campestris is highly attracted to \\"far red light\\", which is a wavelength that is reflected by most plant surfaces. Dodders that were exposed to unfiltered light were able to attach to their host before their energy had been totally exhausted, but dodders that were only exposed to red light lost their way. This could be a technique by which to control C. campestris infestations if exposed to red light within the early stages of development, to avoid the spread and growth of the plant.

He is known for his collaboration with Auguste Mariette. His younger brother was Gabriel Dev√©ria. Life Photograph of Th√©odule Deveria Th√©odule Charles Dev√©ria was born in Paris on 1 July 1831, son of the painter Achille Dev√©ria. In 1843 he met the Egyptologist √âmile Prisse d'Avennes, who instilled in him an interest in the subject that was confirmed during a visit to the Leiden museum in 1846. He studied Coptic and Arabic, and attended the Coll√®ge de France where he was taught by √âtienne Marc Quatrem√®re. He entered the Cabinet of Prints in 1851, where his father was the preserving assistant, and where he learned photography. In 1855 Dev√©ria created lithographs for publication from a set of negatives of photographs made in Egypt of excavations in Thebes. That year he joined the Louvre's Department of Egyptian Antiquities with the task of cataloging the many objects that Auguste Mariette had discovered during his excavations and sent to France. In 1856 he illustrated Mariette's Choix de monuments et de dessins d√©couverts ou ex√©cut√©s pendant le d√©blaiement du S√©rap√©um de Memphis. In December 1858 Dev√©ria left for Egypt to help Mariette read inscriptions in Cairo and its surroundings. He tried to accurately document the archaeological sites using drawings, stampings and photographs. His calotype pictures from this trip are often poor in quality, showing a lack of technical skills. In 1860 he was appointed preserving assistant at the Louvre's Department of Egyptology. He revisited Egypt in 1861‚Äì62, traveling up the Nile to Philae at the First Cataract, and into Nubia to the Abu Simbel temples. After returning he helped Mariette prepare descriptions of the excavation in Egypt in 1850‚Äì54 for publication. In November 1864 Dev√©ria met the future oriental scholar Arthur Rhon√© (1836‚Äì1910). A month later Dev√©ria, Rhon√© and some friends sailed to Egypt, where they visited Alexandria, Cairo, Memphis, and saw the work on the Suez Canal by Ferdinand de Lesseps. Dev√©ria made drawings and took photographs that were reproduced in an album of 77 plates. The party went on to the Holy Land, Damascus and Istanbul. Dev√©ria made a fourth and last visit to Egypt in 1865-66, traveling with Mariette. In 1868 he was made a knight of the Legion of Honor. He died in Paris on 31 January 1871. The renowned Sir E. A. Wallis Budge noted of him, \\"No other scholar had such a wide and competent knowledge of the Book of the Dead\\", and that his death was a \\"great loss\\" to Egyptology. Criticism of the Book of Abraham facsimiles Among his contributions was the first critical assessment of the interpretation made by Joseph Smith of Egyptian vignettes that appear in the Mormon scripture the Book of Abraham. His comments appeared in several publications, including the book The Rocky Mountain Saints: A Full and Complete History of the Mormons.

Ronsard began writing the poem in the 1540s for Henry II of France, but it was only in 1572 that the poet published, now for Charles IX, the first four books of a planned twenty- four. Various reasons have been given to explain why the poem was never finished. Obviously, the death of his dedicatee Charles IX meant that Ronsard would have to have made certain changes. Another factor might have been the verse form: Ronsard wrote in decasyllables, not alexandrines. Other reasons, too, have been put forward. More recently, it has been stated that \\"[any] attempt to pin down why the Franciade was left unfinished, while potentially interesting, probably futile\\" and that \\"we must read it despite [the fact it is unfinished], not as a fragment of what might have been, but as a text in its own right\\". Plot The poem begins in Epirus, where its hero Francus is living a lazy life with his mother Andromache and his uncle Helenus. The poem claims that Francus (the new name of Astyanax) did not die (as Homer wrote in the Iliad), but that he was saved and awaits a new mission: to found France. Jupiter, however, hopes that Francus will give up his lazy ways and set off on his mission. He thus sends down Mercury to remind him of his destiny. Francus eventually builds ships and sets sail. The second book opens with the tale of Francus' journey and shipwreck. He lands on the island of Crete and is welcomed by Prince Dic√©e. Francus saves the prince's son from a giant, and the prince's two daughters fall in love with him. The third book is focused on the love story between Francus and one of the sisters, Clym√®ne, who eventually dies, whereas the fourth and final book is mainly given over to the other sister Hyante, who delivers to Francus a prophecy about how he will give travel and eventually found France. Most of the book thus takes place on the island of Crete, whose representation owes much both to classical sources and contemporary travel narratives. Reception Ever since Sainte-Beuve published his Tableau historique et critique de la po√©sie et du th√©√¢tre fran√ßais du XVIe si√®cle in 1828, the Franciad has generally been considered a failure. But that was not the case when the poem was first published, as more recent scholars are starting to realize. Jean Braybrook, for one, notes that until recently \\"critics have tended simply to see the epic as a failure\\" but that \\"in so doing, they have overlooked the interest with which it was originally received [...] and the imitations it prompted\\". Jean-Claude Ternaux, too, has written that it is \\"historically incorrect\\" to state that the poem was not a success at the time. When Ronsard died, in fact, the poet Jacques du Perron's funeral speech called Ronsard a \\"genius\\" and an \\"oracle\\" specifically because of the Franciad. Recent scholarship is indeed pointing towards a changing of the tide, as the poem's political, historical, and poetic value is evaluated in new ways. Literary context Fran√ßois Rigolot has stated that Ronsard wanted to \\"give birth to France\\" by writing the Franciad, another way of saying that writing an epic in Renaissance France was a kind of national project. Fellow Pl√©iade poet Joachim Du Bellay had indeed written in his Defense and illustration of the French Tongue, that writing a French epic was of utmost importance and that it would allow the French language to \\"hold its head high\\". English translation The Franciad has been available in English since 2010. The English version by Phillip John Usher begins: :Muse atop the summits of Parnassus, :Steer my speech and sing for me that race :Of French kings descended from Francion, :Hector‚Äôs son and of Trojan stock, :Who in his tender childhood was called :Astyanax or by the name Scamandrius. :Tell me of this Trojan‚Äôs misfortunes, :Of the wars he fought, of his mission, :And tell me how many times on the seas :(Despite Neptune and Juno) he overcame Fortune :And how many times on solid ground he escaped :From danger, before going on to build the walls of Paris. The English translation has been well received by critics: Kathleen Wine called it \\"a vibrant and highly readable translation,\\" adding that \\"Usher manages both to make the poem accessible to readers [‚Ä¶] while nonetheless endowing it with a vigorous rhythm that lends itself to reading aloud,\\" and summarizing that the translation is \\"[a] work of scholarship and a labor of love.\\" The edition, published by AMS Press, also includes an extensive introduction to the poem's style, historical context, use of mythology, and other issues.

Early life Born in San Francisco in 1926, Janet Dietrich (better known as Jan) was the daughter of Richard Dietrich, who worked in the import business, and his wife, Marion. Dietrich began flying at an early age, getting a student pilot certificate at age 16. Jan and her identical twin sister Marion were the only girls in an aviation class at Burlingame High School. As an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, Dietrich was president of the UC Flying Club and trained at Oakland International Airport, where she earned her private pilot's license in 1946. In 1947, Janet Dietrich and her sister Marion entered the inaugural Chico-to-San Mateo Air Race and took first place, defeating experienced men. After placing in other local races, the flying twins collected the second-place trophy in the 1954 All- Women's Transcontinental Air Race, known as the Powder Puff Derby, flying a Stinson Voyager loaned to them by Futurist Donald Prell. Soon after graduating from Cal in 1949, Dietrich became chief pilot of Cessna. In her job, Dietrich delivered multi-engine aircraft from the factory in Wichita conducted test flights for the shop, flew charters, and supervised the flight and ground schools. In 1953 she was the chief pilot of Santa Monica Flyers, a flight school in Santa Monica, California. In the late 1950s, Dietrich worked as the head of the Flight Department for Air Oasis Company at the Long Beach Airport, and she mentions having this position in her appearance on the January 31, 1957 episode of You Bet Your Life‚Äîindeed, she uses the secret word \\"head\\" in identifying her position, but Groucho Marx's assistants did not notice. Later, she was a federal pilot examiner for the Federal Aviation Administration, performing pilot evaluations and issuing certificates.http://www.astronautix.com/astros/dietrich.htm NASA testing In 1960, Dietrich and her sister were among a select group of female aviators invited to the Lovelace Clinic in Albuquerque, where experts had screened potential NASA astronauts. The women underwent the same medical tests and examinations as Alan Shepherd, John Glenn, and the other men who eventually traveled into space. The extensive exams included everything from swallowing 3 feet of rubber hose to drinking radioactive water. Though only 5 feet 3 inches tall and 100 pounds, Dietrich completed the regimen of tests, as did her sister and 11 other women. While the women waited for the next phase of their program in July 1961, the testing was halted without warning or explanation. It would be two more decades before the United States launched its first woman into space, Sally Ride, an astrophysicist turned astronaut. Later career In 1960, Dietrich became the nation's first woman to earn an Airline Transport Pilot License, the highest Federal Aviation Administration license, followed by a career of commercial flying that lasted well into the 1970s. Dietrich would work for World Airways, an Oakland corporation that became a key military contractor during the Vietnam War. In that capacity she piloted regular flights between the war zone and World's base at Oakland International Airport. However, the death of her twin sister in 1974 brought Dietrich's piloting career to an end. In 2006, the International Women's Air & Space Museum opened an exhibit honoring the Mercury 13 - Mercury Women: Forgotten Link to the Future. And in May 2007, the women of Mercury 13 received honorary doctor of science degrees from the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh. Over a 34-year aviation career, Dietrich accumulated more than 12,000 hours in the pilot seat. Neither she nor her sister were ever married. Dietrich died on 5 June 2008 in San Francisco of natural causes at the age of 81.http://www.sfgate.com/cgi- bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/06/17/BA4211A0VO.DTL#ixzz1DxgTd0AI References Category:1926 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Aviators from California Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:Mercury 13 Category:American female commercial aviators Category:People from San Francisco ","title":"Janet Dietrich"},{"id":"18000567","text":"Jonathan Firstenberg is an American television composer, music supervisor, producer and consultant.

He made his first footsteps into television in the 1990s as a reporter co-presenting TV2's Newsnight alongside Simon Dallow and Alison Mau, but it was a 2003 episode of travel show, Intrepid Journeys, that set him on a new broadcasting path. Since then the longtime talkback radio host has won acclaim and awards for Off the Rails, which chronicles his journey along New Zealand's railway lines, and he spent a month in Antarctica for the series, Ice. In December 2008 Lush began work on a new television series, South, in which he explores Southland and Otago. South went to air in August 2009. Lush was raised largely in Auckland, the fourth son of a printer and a speech therapist. He began his long career in talkback by presenting a show on student station Radio B (now 95bFM), where he worked alongside Eating Media Lunch co-creator Paul Casserly. At the age of 24, he went on to take over the graveyard talkback shift on 1ZB.NZ On Screen biography During the late 1990s, he hosted the breakfast show on Auckland's 91ZM and from 2000 it was heard nationwide, except in Wellington and Christchurch. Lush's ZM programme was axed in 2001 when the 91ZM Wellington breakfast show hosted by Polly and Grant took over. Marcus Lush moved to Southland in 2002 to host the breakfast show on Foveaux FM, but left the station in 2004, and in 2005 began presenting an evening talkback programme on the newly established Radio Live. In 2007, he then became breakfast host on Radio Live.

He was born in Blackpool. Beginning with A Guide to Gun Collecting and Guns Through the Ages (both 1961) to The British Over and Under Shotgun co-authored with Susan Boothroyd (2004), Boothroyd was a prolific author on the subject of firearms. Whilst employed with Imperial Chemical Industries, an ammunition manufacturer, Boothroyd wrote a letter to Fleming professing admiration for the character of James Bond, but not his choice of weapons, particularly the .25 calibre Beretta. Fleming responded to Boothroyd, and their correspondence about weaponry has been reprinted in various places. As a result of the correspondence Fleming gave Bond a 7.65mm Walther PPK pistol in Dr. No and created a character named \\"Major Boothroyd\\" in the novel (the real Boothroyd held no such rank). Prior to the correspondence Fleming is reported to have thought the subject of guns to be rather dull and uninteresting. Boothroyd advised Fleming on the use of silencers and suggested various firearms for use by Bond and other characters. Boothroyd provided illustrator Richard Chopping with his own .38 Smith & Wesson snubnosed revolver, modified with one third of the trigger guard removed, to meet Fleming's wish for a design incorporating a pistol and a rose for the first edition cover of From Russia, with Love. Boothroyd had to assist the police with their enquiries when a similar weapon was used in a triple murder in Glasgow explaining that his weapon had been posted to Ian Fleming for a book cover. Peter Manuel was later arrested, convicted and executed for the murder. In the first Bond film, Dr. No, Major Boothroyd, portrayed by Peter Burton, recreates the scene from the novel. Geoffrey Boothroyd appeared as himself in a short film The Guns of James Bond available on the Dr. No Ultimate Edition DVD.

The site is now occupied by Sebber Church was well as Sebber Kloster Golf Club and Sebber Abbey manor house. Sebber Church  History  Interior of Sebber Church Altar of Sebber Church Sebber Priory was established as early as 1250 and certainly before 1268 as a house for Benedictine nuns. The priory was dedicated to St Lawrence. Its founding details are uncertain; it may have begun as an Augustinian house. It appears that Sebbersund was already a village in Viking times, a trading place for ships plying the Limfjord between the North Sea and the Baltic. Over 300 Viking age graves were found in one of the largest Viking cemeteries found to date on the same ground as the priory was built. Sebbersund seems to have historically been a religious site dating to pre-Christian times. Sebber Priory was constructed in Gothic style of red brick, the most common building material of the time. The priory was built to house approximately 12 Benedictine nuns in a relatively isolated place where they could practice a contemplative life without interference from the outside world. The original monastery included a refectory, assembly hall, dormitory as well as the Priory church (Klosterkirken). Reformation in Denmark The Reformation brought an end to Sebber Priory when King Christian III and the State Council adopted the , establishing Lutheranism as the state church in October 1536. The abbey and its estate reverted to the crown and was then given over to Christian Friis, a noble from Aalborg. In 1581 Sebber Kloster passed to Oluf Brockenhuus, who lived there until his death in 1608. In 1677 Major General Casper Christoffer Brockenhuus (ca. 1649 - 1713) became the sole owner of the estate. In 1697 Christoffer Brockenhuus sold the farm to the merchant (1647-1707). At his death, J√∏rgen Jensen Gleerup (1748 - 1798) took over Sebber Abbey (Sebber Kloster). Sebber Abbey Subsequent generations consolidated the estate's economy and improved its operation. The manor has been owned by the Tesdorf family since 1957. The main building of the manor burned down in 1959 and was rebuilt. In 2006, the manor underwent restoration and is now open for public occupancy. Sebber Church The former monastery church is still preserved and operated as a parish church in the Diocese of Aalborg. Sebber Church (Sebber Kirke) was the main building of the medieval priory. It remains much as it was during the Middle Ages. The church is located in direct connection with Sebber Abbey and has a direct walking path to the main building. The baptismal font and crucifix date from the days when it was still a priory church.

Fourteen people were killed and forty injured when a dust explosion occurred at a sugar refinery owned by Imperial Sugar. Dust explosions had been an issue of concern among United States authorities since three fatal accidents in 2003, with efforts made to improve safety and reduce the risk of recurrence. The refinery was large and old, featuring outdated construction methods, and these factors are believed to have contributed to the fire's severity. The origin of the explosion has been narrowed down to the center of the factory. It was believed to have occurred in a basement beneath storage silos. Investigations conducted by the Department of Justice ruled out deliberate criminal activity in 2013.\\"Imperial Sugar avoids criminal charges for fatal Georgia plant dust explosion.\\" www.dualdraw.com, March 4, 2013. As a result of the disaster, new safety legislation was proposed. The local economy declined because the factory was closed down. Imperial intended to rebuild it and return to production by the end of 2008, with replacement buildings to be completed by summer the following year. Some victims filed legal suits for damages against the owner and the company hired to clean up the refinery. Imperial said that the explosion was the main reason for a major loss in the first quarter of 2008. The U.S. Chemical Safety Board released its report on the incident in September 2009, saying that the explosion had been \\"entirely preventable\\". Investigations by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also concluded that sugar dust was the fuel for an explosion that could have been prevented. By September 2010, 44 suits had been filed in Chatham County Court against Imperial Sugar and/or its cleaning contractor. Eighteen have been settled.Skutch, Jan. \\"Appellate court rejects pre-trial appeal in Imperial Sugar case.\\" Savannah Morning News. www.savannahnow.com, September 23, 2010.

Imperial bought the refinery together with Savannah Foods to form part of a national supply and distribution network to meet demand from businesses such as Piggly Wiggly, General Mills and Wal-Mart. The refinery sat on a site and was spread across of it. This network was the second largest in the US.Bynum, Russ. \\"Ga. sugar refinery demolishing blasted silos.\\" USA Today. www.usatoday30.usatoday.com, June 24, 2008. Retrieved September 26, 2014.

They said the site had continued operating because it had good access to rail and shipping links for transport. In the last full fiscal year before the disaster, which ended on September 30, 2007, the facility refined 14.51 million hundredweight of sugar, 9% of the nation's requirements, compared to Imperial's Gramercy, Louisiana, refinery, which refined 11.08 million hundredweight of sugar in the same time period. 90% of the raw sugar supplied to the facility came from overseas in that year, and the company expected the \\"vast majority\\" to come in from abroad in the year of the explosion as well. In the time leading up to the explosion, Imperial Sugar had run into financial difficulties. In the fiscal year ending September 30, 2007, sales fell 8%, while profits were down 50% from that year's fourth quarter, and stock also down by half since April 2007.

Most of the three-mile (5 km) stretch of river that had previously been closed was reopened without restriction, although a patrol remained in place to enforce a safety zone. The river restrictions delayed one outgoing vessel and two incoming ones. There was also a minor oil spill originating from equipment at the refinery's unoccupied and rarely used dock. The explosion seriously weakened the structure of the facility, leaving it highly unstable, and there was extensive smoke damage. The packaging area was totally destroyed and in all, 12% of the refinery was demolished by the explosion.

Federal investigations by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) were launched, and they interviewed witnesses, checked documentation, and conducted on-scene examination of the plant. OSHA arrived within two hours and the CSB within 48 hours. Other brief investigations were conducted by state firefighters and police and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, but these were ended quickly after confirming there was no evidence of the explosion and fire having been deliberately started.Press Release. \\"Statement of CSB Investigations Manager Stephen Selk, P.E., Updating the Public on the Investigation of the Imperial Sugar Company Explosion and Fire, Savannah, Georgia.\\" www.csb.gov, February 17, 2008.

In a press conference held on February 17, 2008, one of the six members of the CSB team said that the explosion showed the ongoing risk from dust explosions despite their report highlighting the matter in 2004. Investigators were unable to enter the silos as OSHA ruled them to be too hazardous after the explosion. They were only able to access the area after the silos were demolished. By the time this took place, four months after the disaster, investigators believed that the explosion started in a basement area beneath the silos, from which sugar was fed up to the packaging building on conveyor belts. The factory's outdated construction materials and methods are believed to have contributed to the severity of the blaze. The ceiling was of wooden tongue and groove design. The creosote used throughout was known as ‚Äúfat lighter,‚Äù because of the fire risk it posed. Interviews of Imperial Sugar employees conducted by OSHA uncovered a lack of training, as 40 of the workers reported never receiving training on how to exit the building in an emergency. Only five employees recalled having a fire drill.Hosier, Fred. \\"Imperial Sugar workers had little emergency exit training.\\" www.safetynewsalert.com, July 20, 2009. Retrieved January 9, 2015.  Aftermath Initial response= Imperial's refinery in Louisiana was shut down by the company six weeks after the Port Wentworth disaster, over fears a similar explosion would occur there. It was kept from operating for more than a week. OSHA fined Imperial $36,000 over safety legislation violations at that plant. The Georgia plant's 371 workers continued to receive payment from Imperial, and 275 were rehired to assist with cleanup and demolition of parts of the refinery that could not be salvaged. Work began on April 18, 2008, after Imperial's board confirmed their intention to rebuild. The plan was for the plant to return to sugar refining by the end of 2008. Demolition of the sugar silos was conducted on June 24, 2008 with a wrecking ball. A replacement packaging building and new sugar silos were intended to be completed by summer 2009. During demolition, of fire-hardened sugar were recovered from one silo, and another from the second. The company hoped to recycle the product for ethanol production. In the first quarter of 2008, Imperial posted a $15.5 million loss, which they said was primarily due to the explosion. Port Wentworth suffered an economic depression after the accident, with local businesses losing many customers. Imperial Sugar was purchased in 2012 by the Louis Dreyfus Group. =Reports from OSHA and CSB= Within a month of the accident, OSHA, fearing that relevant employers may be unaware their facilities presented a risk of dust explosions, sent a letter to 30,000 employees to alert them to the danger of a similar explosion occurring. OSHA also proposed the Combustible Dust Explosion and Fire Prevention Act of 2008, a new bill aimed at introducing regulations to reduce the risk of dust explosions.\\"110th Congress, 2d Session.

Specifically, internal company memorandums by managers in 1967 expressed their concern about the potential of explosions from sugar dust. Imperial Sugar had recently made construction changes that enabled the accumulation of sugar dust. It had never practiced evacuation procedures, and the lack of emergency lighting meant that people were confined to dark hallways and tunnels at the time of the explosions. =Legal issues= Victims of the disaster continued to file claims against Imperial Sugar and its construction contractor. By September 2010, 44 civil suits had been filed in Chatham County Court in relation to the explosion, and eighteen had been settled. The state appeals court rejected an effort by defendants' attorneys for a pre-trial appeal in two related cases in an effort to limit damages.

In 1998 it was incorporated into the Royal High School.Royal High School (2012)  Early history  The Royal School for Daughters of Officers of the Army grew out of the Officers' Widows and Orphans Fund, initiated by philanthropist Alfred Douglas Hamilton as a result of the Crimean War. The school was founded in 1864, and opened on 24 August 1865 under Lady Superintendant) Emmeline Maria Kingdon, who was recommended by Florence Nightingale. She retired in 1882. Funding came in part from Queen Victoria who was a patron. The school's mission was to provide practical and religious education for the daughters of army officers who might otherwise be unable to afford it. The Royal Patriotic Fund was already providing for needy families of soldiers and non-commissioned officers. The Royal Naval Female School, founded in 1840, provided assistance for the daughters of naval officers. It formed the model on which the new school was based. The Royal School was privately funded, relying on a mixture of subscriptions, legacies and other gifts, and fees. Subscribers were eligible to vote on which girls would receive admission at reduced fees (initially twelve pounds). Greater contributors received more votes. Laggan House - one of the boarding houses of the school The school's building was originally intended to be a boys' day school. This school failed and the building, in Lansdown on the outskirts of Bath, was purchased in September 1863. A London office was maintained, initially on Cockspur Street, until a bursar was appointed at Bath after World War II. In 1870 a junior school was opened in Clarence House at Roehampton, for girls aged ten to fourteen. However, this branch of the school struggled to achieve the standards of the parent institution. In 1885 the junior school closed and the girls transferred to Bath.Osborne & Manisty (1966)  War years  In September 1939, after war was declared, the school moved to Longleat and the Admiralty's Hydrographic Department took over the Lansdown premises.Sadler (2008) Significant improvisation and some construction were required to make the situation workable. Lack of space, and difficulty in retaining domestic and teaching staff, were among many problems. However, the school remained at Longleat until the end of summer term in 1947. During this time the system of voting for foundationers was suspended, never to be reinstated. This period also saw the deaths of their host Lord Bath, a president The Duke of Connaught, and two chairmen.  Pupils  The basic admission requirements, at the outset, were reflected in the school's name. A motion to include the word \\"necessitous\\" was defeated, but the school's aims were nevertheless charitable. Daughters of needy officers were admitted at ¬£12 per annum, significantly below cost. Other families paid more. In about 1889, for financial reasons, the committee decided to admit granddaughters of officers and, with the highest fees, daughters of civilian gentlemen. Most fathers were commissioned officers, but a few rose from the ranks. The normal age for admission was ten to fifteen. Girls were expected to be able to read and write, and be in good health. Parents were encouraged to send their girls young. It was considered difficult to help them, if they had received only a haphazard education, as they grew older. Pupils were required to leave at age eighteen, except under special circumstances. The leaving age was relaxed as academic achievement and admission to university became more important, but the rule was not formally abolished until 1949. The school was initially only open only to Protestant families. This restriction prevented the school from obtaining a grant from the Royal Patriotic Fund to assist with its foundation, but was not lifted until 1920. A significant number of places were taken by girls who had lost their fathers. In 1901, during the Boer War, 54 out of 120 pupils were fatherless. During the early decades of the school, girls came from all over the empire. A particularly large group was those born in India, whether to officers of the Indian Army or British Army units stationed there. When the Indian Army was disbanded in 1947, the school lost an important source of financial support. After the return from Longleat, the school agreed in principle to accept some pupils sponsored by local education authorities; very few came. In 1949, a few day girls were admitted for the first time. A ratio of 20 day girls to 250 boarders was thought appropriate to maintain the character of the school.

This is in contrast to the more traditional Texas Rig, where the weight slides inline, resting on the nose of the bait, or the Carolina Rig, where the weight is fixed above the bait. The drop shot rig provides the ability to keep a lure off the bottom, with weightless action. Usually the bait is fished by letting the weight hit the bottom and then shaking the lure by twitching the rod. But can also be flipped, dragged, hopped, or jigged along the bottom. This simple, but versatile technique has endless combinations with the different hooks, soft plastics and weights that can be used.[1] The aim is to present a free floating, slow twitching lure to induce a strike from non-aggressive fish. This rigs known use is in bass fishing commonly used for catching Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, and Spotted Bass. But can also be used for a variety of other fish species.  How to fish  The Drop Shot Rig can be used in any place that looks like it could hold a bass. Similar to jig fishing the weight will need to hit the bottom, and fished along the bottom by twitching the rod. Another commonly used application of this rig is on deep suspended fish. The rig can be dropped down onto a school of fish directly under the boat. Because the bait is above the weight it is held up off the bottom, it makes for an easier target for fish that are suspended. Usually when throwing the bait the user will want to target harder bottoms having rock or gravel. Another place the drop shot rig is thrown, is in and around brush found on the bottom either man made or natural. The drop shot rig can even be fished from shore. Casting out away from the bank and letting the rig fall til it hits bottom or the line goes slack. Once the lure is on the bottom reel the line till it is taut and shake the rig in place. Due to the drop shot rig being a finesse rig the gear used when fishing the drop shot rig is spinning gear and light line. The line usually consist of 8-10 lb fluorocarbon or mono-filament. The hook used is usually a light wire octopus or round bend style hook. The weights are usually pretty light, and some have a swivel to prevent line twist. Some weights have a wire attached to the swivel that is used to pinch the line. The snap also makes it efficient for getting the lure free from a snag, because the line can be pulled through the snap retrieving the lure. One of the more commonly used knots when using the dropshotting technique is the palomar knot. The tag end of the knot is then placed through the eye of the hook to keep the hook out at a ninety degree angle. Once the tag line is put through the eye of the hook the weight is applied at the desired length from the lure and is ready to be fished. The common hookset used when drop shotting is a reel set. This is where the fishermen feels the bite and starts reeling while lifting the rod. Causing the thin wire hook to slide up into the top of the fish's mouth. This hook set is commonly used with the drop shot due to the thin wire hook. If the hook is set too hard then it could cause the hook to bend and lose the fish. Another important reason for this hookset is to keep from breaking the light line usually associated with this form of fishing.

An early organizer of the New Thought Movement, she is best known as the founder of Home of Truth. With her sister Harriet Hale Rix, Annie Rix Militz was a founder of the West Coast Metaphysical Bureau, a group whose aim was to study philosophies and religions.  Biography  Annie Rix Militz was born in California in March, 1856, the first child of Hale and Annie P. Militiz.\\"Annie Rix Militz.\\" Religious Leaders of America, 2nd ed. Gale Group, 1999. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center. Farmington Hills, Mich.: Gale, 2008. She was a schoolteacher in San Francisco in her early thirties when she attended a class taught by Emma Curtis Hopkins, the New Thought \\"teacher of teachers\\". During the meeting Annie found herself healed of both a migraine and deafness in one ear. That same year, 1887, saw Annie, Harriet, and Sadie Gorie found the Christian Science Home, soon renamed the Home of Truth. In 1890, she moved to Chicago to study at Emma Curtis Hopkins' Christian Science Theological Seminary and was ordained, along with Charles and Myrtle Fillmore, the following year. At the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893 in Chicago, Illinois, she met the Hindu teacher Swami Vivekananda, an event that influenced her to turn away from her formerly Christian view of New Thought to become inclusively interfaith. Her writings emphasize methods of healing and techniques for the development of mental powers. In 1911 she broke with Unity Church to promote her own emerging interfaith New Thought teachings. The 1915 International New Thought Alliance (INTA) conference, held in conjunction with the Panama-Pacific International Exposition -- a world's fair that took place in San Francisco -- featured New Thought speakers from far and wide. The PPIE organizers were so favorably impressed by the INTA convention that they declared a special \\"New Thought Day\\" at the fair and struck a commemorative bronze medal for the occasion, which was presenting to the INTA delegates, led by Annie Rix Militz. Dresser, Horatio, History of the New Thought Movement, 1919 Militz was a past president of the International New Thought Alliance. Militz and her sister are best known today as the founders, in 1905, of The Home of Truth, an independent New Thought denomination which is a member of INTA, located in Alameda, California.

Various soft plastic fishing rigs and methods have evolved through anglers targeting specific fish species. The Carolina rig is a plastic bait rig similar to the Texas rig, but with the weight fixed above the hook, instead of sliding down to it. The Carolina rig is suitable for beginning fishers. This specific rig is designed to help fishermen catch bottom feeding fish, particularly bass fish. When placed in water, bait attached to a Carolina rig will move in a circular motion. Bass are attracted to this movement and are therefore more likely to bite the lure. The Carolina rig also provides benefits for colder seasons. The heavy weight on the rig allows the bait to reach deeper waters, where fish typically stay in winter months.

He also played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Los Angeles Kings, New Jersey Devils, and the Carolina Hurricanes. Loktionov was drafted by the Kings in the fifth round, 128th overall, at the 2008 NHL Entry Draft Playing career A product of the HC Khimik hockey school in Voskresensk, Loktionov then skated for Spartak Moscow's system before signing with Lokomotiv Yaroslavl. He is also a longtime member of the 1990-born Team Russia. He was drafted 123rd overall in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft by the Los Angeles Kings. During the 2010‚Äì11 season, Loktionov scored his first career NHL goal on 19 October 2010, against Justin Peters of the Carolina Hurricanes. He was with the Kings during their 2012 Stanley Cup championship season, but did not have his name engraved on the Stanley Cup as he only played 39 regular season games (less than half of the season) with the team. On 6 February 2013, Loktionov was acquired by the New Jersey Devils in exchange for a fifth-round draft pick in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft. He was then assigned to the Devils' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Albany Devils. On 5 March 2014, Loktionov was traded to the Carolina Hurricanes, along with a 2017 conditional third-round draft pick, in exchange for winger Tuomo Ruutu. At the end of the season, the Hurricanes opted not to provide Loktionov with a qualifying offer and as a result, he became an unrestricted free agent on 1 July 2014. Without a club midway into the 2014‚Äì15 season, Loktionov signed for the remainder of the season to return to Lokomotiv Yaroslavl in the KHL on 28 November 2014. After three seasons in the KHL with Lokomotiv, Loktionov as a free agent following the 2016‚Äì17 season, opted for another attempt at the NHL in accepting a professional try-out to attend his original draft club, the Los Angeles Kings training camp on 14 July 2017. He was released by the Kings on 27 September 2017. Loktionov returned to Russia and continued his tenure with Lokomotiv. After five seasons with Lokomotiv Yaroslavl, Loktionov left as a free agent following the 2018‚Äì19 season. He signed a one-year contract to continue in the KHL with Metallurg Magnitogorsk on 1 May 2019. In the 2019‚Äì20 season, Loktionov played in a bottom six role registering just 3 goals and 13 points in 60 regular season games. He made 5 post-season appearances, collecting 2 assists. Loktionov opted for free agency for the second straight season, agreeing to a two-year contract with contending club, CSKA Moscow on 1 May 2020.

He is famous because of his connection to Johannes Vermeer. In August 1663 he owned a painting by Vermeer when he was visited by Balthasar de Monconys. Van Buyten told the diplomat, accompanied by two friends, he had paid 600 guilders (?) for the painting. Monconys opined that he would have thought he had overpaid for it had he bought it for sixty guilders.J.M. Montias, Vermeer and his milieu. A web of social history, p. 180. In a disposition of January 1676, a month and a half after Vermeer's death, Catharina Bolnes appeared before a notary to acknowledge that she had sold and transferred two paintings by her late husband to Van Buyten. Catharina further declared that she had been paid 617 guilders for the two paintings, which she owed Van Buyten for bread delivered. He would return the paintings, a person playing on a cittern and another representing two persons one of whom is sitting writing a letter if she paid all her debts. Catharina had persistently urged him to. She had over twelve years to refund the main part of the debt at fifty guilders per year, and she did not even have to pay interest.J.M. Montias, p. 218. Van Buyten must have delivered a great deal of bread to accumulate a total credit of over 726 guilders.J.M. Montias, p. 217. Van Buyten was married to Machtelt van Asson and in 1683 to Adriana Waelpot. If he earned more than 600 guilders a year, he belonged to the richest people in Holland, where a guilder a day was seen as a very good salary.

(1993) Bayesian Implementation. Pg. 13-14. Under Pareto efficiency, an allocation of a resource is Pareto efficient if there is no other allocation of that resource that makes no one worse off while making some agents strictly better off. A limitation with the concept of Pareto efficiency is that it assumes that knowledge about other market participants is available to all participants, in that every player knows the payoffs and strategies available to other players so as to have complete information. Often, the players have types that are hidden from the other player. Overview The lack of complete information raises a question of when the efficiency calculation should be made. Should the efficiency check be made at the ex ante stage before the agent sees their types, at the interim stage after the agent sees their types, or at the ex post stage where the agent will have complete information about their types? Another issue is incentive. If a resource allocation rule is efficient but there is no incentive to abide by that rule or accept that rule, then the revelation principle asserts that there is no mechanism by which this allocation rule can be realized. Bayesian efficiency overcomes problems of the Pareto efficiency by accounting for incomplete information, by addressing the timing of the evaluation (ex ante efficient, interim efficient, or ex post efficient), and by adding an incentive qualifier so that the allocation rule is incentive compatible.Baltagi, Badi Hani. (2001) A Companion to Theoretical Econometrics. Blackwell Publishing. Bayesian efficiency separately defines three types of efficiency: ex ante, interim, and ex post. For an allocation rule x:T\\\\to A: Ex ante efficiency: x is incentive compatible, and there exists no incentive compatible allocation rule y:T\\\\to A that :\\\\int U^i(y(t),t)dG^i(t) \\\\geq \\\\int U^i(x(t),t)dG^i(t) for all i, with strict inequality for some i. Interim efficiency: x is incentive compatible, and there exists no incentive compatible allocation rule y:T\\\\to A that :\\\\int U^i(y(t),t)dG^i(t_{-i}t_i) \\\\geq \\\\int U^i(x(t),t)dG^i(t_{-i}t_i) for all i and t_i, with strict inequality for some i and t_i. Ex post efficiency: x is incentive compatible, and there exists no incentive compatible allocation rule y:T\\\\to A that :U^i(y(t),t) \\\\geq U^i(x(t),t) for all i, with strict inequality for some i. Here, G^i are beliefs, U^i are utility functions, and i are agents. An ex ante efficient allocation is always interim and ex post efficient, and an interim efficient allocation is always ex post efficient.

Wigley (born Scotland 1825 - died 20 January 1866, Rome, Italy) was a British architect, journalist and supporter of Catholic causes.  Life  Church of the Redeeemer and St. Alphonsus Liguori; Rome By profession he was an architect, but subsequently devoted himself to journalism in Paris. He was one of the band of laymen who surrounded Frederick Ozanam and who founded with him the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. At Ozanam's suggestion, he wrote some letters to The Tablet describing the aims and the work of the new Society. Frederick Lucas, editor of The Tablet, then wrote some articles on the same subject and in January, 1844, the English branch was formed, with Wigley, who was by then living in London, becoming one of the original thirteen members. He designed the Redeemer and St. Alphonsus Liguori titular church, Esquiline, Rome, which was built in 1855-59. In or about 1860 Wigley took a leading part in forming both in England and in France the Peterspence Association for assisting the Pope. Shortly after, Pius IX bestowed on him the Cross of St. Gregory the Great. He met his death in attending one of the St. Vincent de Paul cases in Rome, a Protestant English sailor. Wigley nursed him, and had him received into the Catholic Church on his death-bed. Then falling ill himself, he went to the hospital of the Brothers of St. John of God, where he died on 20 January 1866.

By 1928 the three remaining Russo brothers fled St. Louis.Waugh, pp. 231-233 *The Pillow Gang -- was an Italian gang led by Pasquale Santino from 1911 until his murder in 1927. Carmelo Frisina took control of the gang, until he himself was murdered in 1931. The gang was then led by Thomas Buffa, who became boss of the St. Louis Mafia family. In 1943, Buffa fled the city and was murdered in 1947 in Lodi, California. The gang's name from the leader, Carmelo Fresina, who carried a pillow with him to sit on after he had been shot in the rear end. =Prohibition era= Mafia activity was recorded in St. Louis as early as the mid-1890s.Waugh, pp. 1-2 By the early 1910s, the recognized Mafia boss in St. Louis was Dominick Giambrone.Waugh, pp. 30 During the prohibition era in St. Louis, there were seven different ethnic gangs; the Green Ones, the Pillow Gang, the Egan's Rats, the Hogan Gang, the Russo Gang, the Shelton Gang and the Cuckoos all fighting to control illegal rackets in the city.

Harvey Publications The first Chamber of Chills was a 10-cent horror anthology published bimonthly by Harvey Publications that ran 26 issues (cover-dated June 1951 - Dec. 1954). Artists included Bob Powell, Lee Elias, Rudy Palais, Howard Nostrand, and Warren Kremer. Issue #7 is mentioned in Dr. Fredric Wertham's 1954 indictment of comic books Seduction of the Innocent (p. 389). Chamber ceased publication following the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency hearings of 1954. Harvey Comics then began concentrating on titles for young children, including Little Dot and Richie Rich. Chamber of Chills was formerly Blondie Comics, taking over that comic‚Äôs numbering with issue #21. After issue #24 (Dec. 1951), the numbering was reset to #1. Chamber of Chills became Chamber of Clues with the February 1955 issue, and ceased publication two issues later, the last cover-dated April 1955. Marvel Comics An unrelated comic-book series titled Chamber of Chills was published by Marvel Comics in the 1970s. It ran 25 issues (Nov. 1972 - Nov. 1976). The title was one of four launched by Marvel Comics editor- in-chief Roy Thomas to form a line of science fiction and horror anthologies with more thematic cohesiveness than the company's earlier attempts that decade, which had included such series as Chamber of Darkness and Tower of Shadows. Whereas those titles generally presented original stories, these new books would instead adapt genre classics and other works. With the four titles' debuts set to be staggered over the course of four months, Marvel premiered Journey into Mystery vol. 2 (Oct. 1972), Chamber of Chills (Nov. 1972), Supernatural Thrillers (Dec. 1972), and, with a late start, Worlds Unknown (May 1973). The first issue features an original six-page story by science fiction novelist George Alec Effinger, \\"Moon of Madness, Moon of Fear\\", penciled by P. Craig Russell (then credited as Craig Russell), and a slightly retitled adaptation of the Harlan Ellison short story \\"Delusions for a Dragon Slayer\\", by writer Gerry Conway and artist Syd Shores; in-between was a story by writer Stan Lee and artist Russ Heath, \\"They Wait in Their...Dungeon\\", reprinted from Menace #1 (March 1953), from Marvel's 1950s forerunner, Atlas Comics. The bimonthly series ran exclusively new material through issue #4, with one reprinted story added to the mix for the following two issues, and only one new story in issue #7, after which the series became all-reprint. Most of the reprinted stories were 1950s \\"pre-Code\\" horror stories, which the industry self-censorship organization the Comics Code Authority had forbidden on Code-approved comics until a loosening of the Code in 1971. Other creators included novelist John Jakes, scripting \\"Spell of the Dragon\\", starring Brak the Barbarian (#2), with art by Val Mayerik and Dan Adkins, and adapting his own short story \\"The Opening of the Crypt\\", a sequel to Edgar Allan Poe's \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\", with art by Frank Brunner (#4); and Gardner F. Fox, a DC Comics veteran from the 1940s on, with a story each in #3 (art by Ernie Chan) and #4 (penciled by Howard Chaykin). Also contributing were Marvel regulars Steve Gerber, Tony Isabella, Larry Lieber, Don McGregor, and Doug Moench, as well as editor Thomas, adapting Robert E.

Madhu, written by S. N. Swamy and produced by M. Mani. It stars Mohanlal, Suresh Gopi, and Ambika. The film's music was composed by Shyam. The plot follows Sagar Alias Jacky (Mohanlal), a maverick youth who runs a gold smuggling racket for Sekharankutty (Gopi), the son of the Chief Minister of Kerala. Their relationship stains after the latter brings narcotics into the business. The film was released on 14 May 1987. It performed well at the box office and became the highest-grossing Malayalam film until then, grossing more than ‚Çπ2 crore at the box office and ran for over 200 days in theatres. It was remade in Kannada as Jackey (1989) and in Telugu as 20va Sathabdam (1990). Devaraj portrayed Shekarankutty in both films. The film also has a spiritual sequel, Sagar Alias Jacky Reloaded, released in 2009 and directed by Amal Neerad with Mohanlal reprising his role.  Plot  The story is about Sagar Alias Jacky and his accomplice Shekharankutty. Ashwathy is a reporter for a news magazine looking to investigate the connection between politics and crime in Kerala. She is drawn to the life of Sagar Alias Jacky who runs a clandestine gold smuggling business for Shekharankutty, son of the Chief Minister of the Kerala state. Jacky is an enigmatic character who stops the smuggling business from growing because of ethical issues with narcotics. Ashwathy publishes a sensational article connecting Jacky to the Chief Minister. After the incident Sagar talks to Ashwathy. Jacky leaves the group because Shekharankutty's friend Koshy says they can do drug business. Jacky and Shekharankutty fight each other with tacts.

Swamy got the idea for the film from a photograph featured in an English-language Sunday magazine published from Calcutta. Swami recalled in an interview that it was the time when mafia bosses had a glorified image in the country after the national emergency period in India (1975 ‚Äì 1977). That was the time when public began to learn about Bombay-based mafia leaders such as Haji Mastan, Yusuf Patel, Varadarajan Mudaliar among others. The magazine had an article on Mastan and a photograph featuring much respected actor Dilip Kumar and his wife Saira Banu touching Mastan's feet for giving pranƒÅma. It was shocking for Swami, he never imagined a mafia leader would be respected as such. It inspired the plot for Irupatham Noottandu and the character Sagar Alias Jacky. The lengthy climax of the film was shot in a single day. Vipindas was the cinematographer. Soundtrack The music was composed by Shyam and lyrics was written by Chunakkara Ramankutty. Box office The film was released on 14 May 1987. It performed well at the box office and became the highest-grossing Malayalam film until then. The film grossed more than ‚Çπ2 crore at the box office and ran for over 200 days in theatres.

When they come out of the DIG's office they meet up with Prabhakaran Thampi who has come there to invite DIG for the stone-laying ceremony for a hospital. Thampi enquires about the investigation. The duo tell him that they are close to catching the culprits, who are masquerading as pillars of the society (referring to Isaac) and that they will unmask them. This frightens Prabhakaran Thampi. That night, when they return from the cinema, they are attacked by a masked man (Thampi's sidekick) in their house acting on the behest of Prabhakaran Thampi. They fight with him and takes his mask from his face and one of his shoes, but he manages to escape from there. The next day Ramdas and Vijayan go to Isaac's house. Vijayan dresses up and acts as a servant named Thankappan in front of Isaac, hoping to take his blood. But Issac does not allows him anywhere near the house. So Ramdas advises him to get employment in another house as servant and in the night to sneak and take the blood of Isaac after knocking him out with chloroform. The neighboring house happens to be Prabhakaran Thampi's house. When Prabhakaran Thampi arrives at house, he does not recognize Vijayan, because of the disguise. Ramdas visits Shobha and apologises for running away from their house the previous time. Shobha's mother in law tells him that her son Rajendran was murdered in an accident. Dasan asks Shobha about this. She tells him that her husband was murdered in a hit-and-run accident at checkpost. However, she did not get any compensatory \\"drying-in-harness\\" job, because Rajendran died two days before completing the mandatory 2 years. He promises her that he will do his best to help her. Meanwhile, at Thampi's house, Vijayan is caught in a power struggle between Thampi's wife and mother. Thampi's maid falls for Vijan, who is annoyed by that. At night, Vijayan sneaks to get Isaac's blood but accidentally, inhales chloroform while sneezing. At midnight, a mysterious figure arrives at Prabhakaran Thampi's house. Prabhakaran Thampi realizes that he is his old friend Ananthan Nambiar. Years ago, acting together, Nambiar and Thampi had stolen some money from a Marwadi businessman and had invested their shares in crime and had thus become mafia dons. Nambiar had broken out from jail and wants Thampi's help to escape. Next morning, Prabhakaran Thampi reads the news about Ananthan Nambiar and gets worried about this compromising him. Anandan Nambiar requests Prabhakaran Thampi to get him a fake passport. Prabhakaran Thampi tells him it won't be easy and suggest Anandan Nambiar to hide in his copra warehouse. Thampi's household maid servant continues to set her cap at Vijayan and flirts with him. Prabhakaran Thampi tells him to give his friend a lift in his bicycle and take him to the copra warehouse. Thampi's mother sees a disguised Ananthan Nambiar and Thampi introduces him as Ibrahim Kutty to his mother. Vijayan takes Ananthan Nambiar to the warehouse. Both Vijayan and Nambiar speak in falsetto, and have doubts that they have met before, but both of them dismiss their doubts. Dasan arrives at Prabhakaran Thampi's house. Prabhakaran Thampi is frightened to see him but welcomes him. They go to the upstairs. Dasan notices Isaac and begin to watch him. At that time, Vijayan arrives there with tea. He also tries to look, but ends up dropping the tea. The tea falls over Thampi who beats him. Vijayan comes back from Thampi's house, finds someone wearing the mask of murderer and beats him. Then Dasan comes, catches Vijayan and saves Damu who had been wearing the mask. Damu criticizes them for not finding any proof for the investigation. Vijayan shouts at Dasan for his lack of support at Prabhakaran Thampi's house. Vijayan tells Ramdas that he is going back to Madras (Chennai). Ramdas reveals to Vijayan that Ananthan Nambiar has broken out from jail and is searching for them. At that time, the phone rings and CI tells them that Home minister is waiting for them. They arrive at a guest house. The Home minister asks them about their developments in the investigation. They tell him that they are observing the suspect from a distance. The Home minister criticizes them for not having carried out a proper investigation and threatens to have them cashiered should they will fail. Ramdas retorts to the Home minister that he has also got a bone to pick about the treatment of SI Rajendran following his accident and reluctance of Govt. to give job to his widow Shobha. He suggests that Home minister should first try to get her job and then criticize the investigation. They leave there in a huff. Ramdas relates to Shobha all that has happened. Vijayan doubts Dasan and teases that he fallen for Shobha. Dasan retaliates by taunting Vijayan for failing to obtain Isaac's blood. Ramdas challenges Vijayan and states that he will bring Isaac's blood without his help. Dasan arrives at a hotel where Isaac and Prof. Vidyadharan have gone for lunch. Dasan tries to get Isaac's blood using a syringe, but manage to get only the waiter. Isaac tries to catch him but he escapes from there. Isaac recognizes Dasan, who has been following. He suspects that he came to stole his experimental details of bird watching. Prabhakaran Thampi arrives at the copra warehouse and tells his man to start the drug running from Idukki. His lorry rams down a check post gate and the police chase them. Meanwhile, Dasan tries to draw Isaac's blood when he is engaged in bird watching. Isaac beats Dasan and chases him but he escapes in his Jeep. At that time Thampi's lorry comes that way, Isaac jumps into the lorry and beats Thampi's men, throws them out and follows Ramdas. Dasan's jeep gets damaged and he sees Thampi's lorry and tries to stop it. When he gets into the lorry, Isaac beats him, but Dasan manages to escape because Issac is distracted by the sound of the bullfinch that he has been studying. The police arrive there and are under the impression that Dasan has single-handedly overpowered the goons and seized the ganja shipment. Realizing what is going on, Dasan acts the part. Prabhakaran Thampi is shocked to hear the news about the seizure of his shipment and blames Ananthan Nambiar for all this. Thampi's man tells Nambiar that there is another way go to Dubai without a passport. He introduces Gafoorka (Mamukkoya) to him, who, for a sum, is willing to redirect his cargo ship sailing to California via Dubai. Gafoorka advises Nambiar dress up as an Arab and teaches him a few basic Arabic greetings. Isaac and Prof. Vidyadharan plan to go after the elusive bullfinch which was observed in an island and by chance, their boarding point is exactly where Gafoorka plans to rendezvous with Nambiar. Dasan and Vijayan who follow Issac and Viyadharan, sees them getting on a boat and looks for the nearest boat which happens to be Gafoorka's. On seeing his nemeses approaching, Nambiar jumps in the lagoon and escapes. Dasan and Vijayan catch Gafoorka and retrieve the money that they had been tricked into paying him, in the previous film. Ananthan Nambiar informs Prabhakaran Thampi that the same CIDs who destroyed his mafia are the ones following him. Thampi blames Nambiar and asks his man Kunjukrishnan to smuggle Nambiar away from Kerala. He suggests to spirit Nambiar away in a lorry. Ramdas requests Shobha to sign an application for her job. Nambiar shocked to see the driver of the lorry, meant to take him away, was Puthanpurakkal Balan. He relates this to Prabhakaran Thampi and adds that Balan is a spy of CIDs. Prabhakaran Thampi decides to punish Balan who is dragged off the road by Thampi's goons, beaten up and kidnapped and presented by Kunjukrishnan before Nambiar. Balan mistakes Nambiar for a Swami. Nambiar threatens him for being a spy. Balan understands what's going on. Nambiar orders Balan to kill Dasan and Vijayan and threatens to kill his family should he disobey. Balan goes to Dasan and Vijayan's home and Damu fights with him. He is rescued by Dasan and tells Vijayan that he will stay with them. Prabhakaran Thampi and Ananthan Nambiar are in the house. Nambiar sees Isaac watching through binoculars. He frightens Prabhakaran Thampi and tells him that he is also a CID spy. Prabhakaran Thampi says he is a poor man who started living some days before. Nambiar reminds Prabhakaran Thampi of that one who caught his ghanja lorry who is bald and fat. This frightens Prabhakaran Thampi and goes to watch him. He also misunderstood Issac as CID spy. Isaac has a suitcase. Thampi and Nambiar decide to catch it, misunderstanding it as evidence against them. At night Balan tries to kill Dasan and Vijayan while they are sleeping. But he couldn't do that. Dasan finds it and is shocked. Vijayan wakes up and tells Dasan that he already told him that Balan is mad. Balan tells them, if he couldn't kill them then he will lose his family, that Ananthan Nambiar threatened him. Dasan and Vijayan are shocked to hear the news of Nambiar. They realise that Namiar is there. Balan tells them about the bald man. He thinks as Kunjukrishnan but Dasan thinks as Isaac. Dasan and Vijayan decides to rescue Balan's family. Next morning, Kunjukrishnan takes away the suitcase from Isaac's hand. Isaac and Prof. Vidyadharan chase him. Dasan and Vijayan along with Balan also chase them. They reaches at Prabhakaran Thampi's coconut farm warehouse. Vijayan and Balan recognise the place. While Isaac tries to retrieve the suitcase, Dasan and Vijayan try to beat Isaac. Dasan and Vijayan realise that Prabhakaran Thampi and Ananthan Nambiar are friends and there begins a fight. Balan tells Dasan and Vijayan that Isaac is not the bald man who threatened him. Dasan and Vijayan asks Isaac who he is. He says that he is a bird watcher. After that they begin to fight together against Kunjukrishnan and gang. Vijayan informs the police. CI arrives there with the police. Dasan and Vijayan find gold from the warehouse. Prabhakaran Thampi, Ananthan Nambiar and their gang get arrested. Dasan arrives at Shobha's house and gives her the appointment letter of her job. The home minister thanks Ramdas and Vijayan for their hard work in finding the culprits and saving his seat. Ramdas also apologises to Isaac for misunderstanding him. Isaac says never mind since it was for a good cause. The film ends by showing Dasan and Vijayan leaving for Tamil Nadu.

The live radio show originated its broadcast from the KIIS-FM studios in Burbank, California. KIIS-FM is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. Seacrest began working in New York City on May 1, 2017, as co-host of the syndicated talk show Live with Kelly and Ryan, and the KIIS-FM radio program continues to air live from 9am to 1pm Eastern Time (ET) / 6 to 10am Pacific Time (PT), with Seacrest currently broadcasting from a studio at the facilities of WABC-TV (where Live is produced). While he is on live TV, prerecorded discussions and bits air on KIIS-FM from 9 to 10am (ET) / 6 to 7am (PT), with his staff supplying live weather and traffic reports. After 10am (ET) / 7am (PT), Seacrest is heard live on KIIS-FM from the Manhattan studio. On Air with Ryan Seacrest is syndicated through an iHeart subsidiary, Premiere Networks. It is heard on over 130 radio stations in the U.S. and Canada. History 275px The radio program, which initially featured newscaster and sidekick Ellen K., includes many popular segments such as Manny Streetz, Ginger Chan with Traffic and \\"60 Seconds of Sleaze\\" featuring entertainment news segment provided by Ellen K. This segment was actually originated by Seacrest's predecessor on KIIS-FM, Rick Dees, in a segment called \\"Dees Sleaze.\\" One of the most popular segments is called \\"Ryan's Roses\\" where listeners call in with the suspicion that their significant other may either have cheated or is considering it. A staff member then calls the accused cheater imitating a florist who wishes to offer them a dozen free roses to be sent to anybody of their choosing. Often the accused cheater will send the flowers to the \\"wrong person,\\" which may result in the \\"truth\\" pouring out and an argument between the couple, moderated by Seacrest. This segment is based on the common radio skit War of the Roses, which has been used on many radio shows around the country since the mid-1990s. On October 7, 2015, Ellen K announced she was leaving the show to launch her own morning show on co-owned 103.5 KOST, beginning October 19. Her last broadcast on Seacrest's show was on October 16, 2015. Following departure from the show, Ellen was replaced by former KIIS-FM midday DJ Sisanie (who was also the substitute host for her on occasional days). Sisanie's selection was officially announced on December 4, 2015, during the KIIS Jingle Ball 2015. On May 1, 2017, Seacrest was named the new co-host of the syndicated television talk show Live with Kelly, which is broadcast weekdays from New York. To accommodate Seacrest's move, a new Manhattan studio was constructed within the facilities of WABC-TV where Live originates. =Foreign markets= * In May 2014, the show hit airwave the first time in Bangkok, Thailand, on COOLcelsius 91.5 every weekday from 7 - 10a.m. * In 2008, Singapore's 987FM was the first station outside the United States to air the program, around November 2010.

Signs and symptoms include abdominal pain, tenderness, rigidity, and bruising of the external abdomen. Complications may include blood loss and infection. Diagnosis may involve ultrasonography, computed tomography, and peritoneal lavage, and treatment may involve surgery. It is divided into two types blunt or penetrating and may involve damage to the abdominal organs. Injury to the lower chest may cause splenic or liver injuries.  Signs and symptoms  The abdominal organs Signs and symptoms are not seen in early days and after some days initial pain is seen. People injured in motor vehicle collisions may present with a \\"seat belt sign\\", bruising on the abdomen along the site of the lap portion of the safety belt; this sign is associated with a high rate of injury to the abdominal organs. Seatbelts may also cause abrasions and hematomas; up to 30 percent of people with such signs have associated internal injuries. Early indications of abdominal trauma include nausea, vomiting, blood in the urine, and fever. The injury may present with abdominal pain, tenderness, distension, or rigidity to the touch, and bowel sounds may be diminished or absent. Abdominal guarding is a tensing of the abdominal wall muscles to guard inflamed organs within the abdomen. Pneumoperitoneum, air or gas in the abdominal cavity, may be an indication of rupture of a hollow organ. In penetrating injuries, an evisceration (protrusion of internal organs out of a wound) may be present.Chih, p.343 Injuries associated with intra-abdominal trauma include rib fractures, vertebral fractures, pelvic fractures, and injuries to the abdominal wall.Hemmila, p. 231  Causes  Motor vehicle collisions are a common source of blunt abdominal trauma. Seat belts reduce the incidence of injuries such as head injury and chest injury, but present a threat to such abdominal organs as the pancreas and the intestines, which may be displaced or compressed against the spinal column. Children are especially vulnerable to abdominal injury from seat belts, because they have softer abdominal regions and seat belts were not designed to fit them. In children, bicycle mishaps are also a common cause of abdominal injury, especially when the abdomen is struck by the handlebars. Sports injuries can affect abdominal organs such as the spleen and kidneys. Falls and sports are also frequent mechanisms of abdominal injury in children. Abdominal injury may result from child abuse and is the second leading cause of child abuse-related death, after traumatic brain injury. Gunshot wounds, which are higher energy than stab wounds, are usually more damaging than the latter.Chih, pp. 346‚Äì348 Gunshot wounds that penetrate the peritoneum result in significant damage to major intra-abdominal structures in some 90 percent of cases.  Pathophysiology  Abdominal trauma can be life-threatening because abdominal organs, especially those in the retroperitoneal space, can bleed profusely, and the space can hold a great deal of blood. Solid abdominal organs, such as the liver and kidneys, bleed profusely when cut or torn, as do major blood vessels such as the aorta and vena cava. Hollow organs such as the stomach, while not as likely to result in shock from profuse bleeding, present a serious risk of infection, especially if such an injury is not treated promptly. Gastrointestinal organs such as the bowel can spill their contents into the abdominal cavity. Hemorrhage and systemic infection are the main causes of deaths that result from abdominal trauma. One or more of the intra-abdominal organs may be injured in abdominal trauma. The characteristics of the injury are determined in part by which organ or organs are injured. = Liver= The liver, the most vulnerable abdominal organ to all forms of injury because of its size and location (in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen), is injured in about five percent of all people admitted to a hospital for trauma. Liver injuries present a serious risk for shock because the liver tissue is delicate and has a large blood supply and capacity. The liver may be lacerated or contused, and a hematoma may develop. It may leak bile, usually without serious consequences. If severely injured, the liver may cause exsanguination (bleeding to death), requiring emergency surgery to stop the bleeding. = Spleen = Spleen is the most common cause of massive bleeding in blunt abdominal trauma to a solid organ. Spleen is the most commonly injured organ. A laceration of the spleen may be associated with hematoma. Because of the spleen's ability to bleed profusely, a ruptured spleen can be life-threatening, resulting in shock. However, unlike the liver, penetrating trauma to the spleen, pancreas and kidneys do not present as much of an immediate threat of shock unless they lacerate a major blood vessel supplying the organs, such as the renal artery. Fractures of the left lower ribs are associated with spleen lacerations in 20 percent of cases. = Pancreas = The pancreas may be injured in abdominal trauma, for example by laceration or contusion. Pancreatic injuries, most commonly caused by bicycle accidents (especially by impact with the handlebars) in children and vehicular accidents in adults, usually occur in isolation in children and accompanied by other injuries in adults. Indications that the pancreas is injured include enlargement and the presence of fluid around the pancreas. = Kidneys = A large hematoma (closed arrow) of the left kidney (open arrow) The kidneys may also be injured; they are somewhat but not completely protected by the ribs. Kidney lacerations and contusions may also occur. Kidney injury, a common finding in children with blunt abdominal trauma, may be associated with bloody urine. Kidney lacerations may be associated with urinoma or leakage of urine into the abdomen. A shattered kidney is one with multiple lacerations and an associated fragmentation of the kidney tissue. = Bowel = The small intestine takes up a large part of the abdomen and is likely to be damaged in penetrating injury. The bowel may be perforated. Gas within the abdominal cavity seen on CT is understood to be a diagnostic sign of bowel perforation; however intra-abdominal air can also be caused by pneumothorax (air in the pleural cavity outside the lungs that has escaped from the respiratory system) or pneumomediastinum (air in the mediastinum, the center of the chest cavity). The injury may not be detected on CT. Bowel injury may be associated with complications such as infection, abscess, bowel obstruction, and the formation of a fistula. Bowel perforation requires surgery.  Diagnosis  Pneumoperitoneum, seen as an air bubble on the lower left side of the X-ray film CT scan showing the liver and a kidney Ten percent of people with polytrauma who had no signs of abdominal injury did have evidence of such injuries using radiological imaging. Diagnostic techniques used include CT scanning, ultrasound, and X-ray. X-ray can help determine the path of a penetrating object and locate any foreign matter left in the wound, but may not be helpful in blunt trauma. Diagnostic laparoscopy or exploratory laparotomy may also be performed if other diagnostic methods do not yield conclusive results. =Ultrasound= Ultrasound can detect fluid such as blood or gastrointestinal contents in the abdominal cavity, and it is a noninvasive procedure and relatively safe. CT scanning is the preferred technique for people who are not at immediate risk of shock, but since ultrasound can be performed right in an emergency room, the latter is recommended for people who are not stable enough to move to CT scanning. A normal ultrasound does not rule out all injuries. =CT= People with abdominal trauma frequently need CT scans for other trauma (for example, head or chest CT); in these cases abdominal CT can be performed at the same time without wasting time in patient care. CT is able to detect 76% of hollow viscous injuries so people who have negative scans are often observed and rechecked if they deteriorate. However, CT has been demonstrated to be useful in screening people with certain forms of abdominal trauma in order to avoid unnecessary laparotomies, which can significantly increase the cost and length of hospitalizations.Demetriades D, Velmahos G, Cornell E 3rd, et al. Selective nonoperative management of gunshot wounds of the anterior abdomen. Arch Surg 1997; 132:178‚Äì183 A meta-analysis of CT use in penetrating abdominal traumas demonstrated sensitivity, specificity and accuracy >= 95%, with a PPV of 85% and an NPV of 98%.Goodman CS, Hur JY, Adajar MA, Coulam CH., How well does CT predict the need for laparotomy in hemodynamically stable patients with penetrating abdominal injury? A review and meta-analysis., AJR Am J Roentgenol. 2009 Aug;193(2):432-7. This suggests that CT is excellent for avoiding unnecessary laparotomies but must be augmented by other clinical criteria to determine the need for surgical exploration (23.37 positive likelihood ratio, 0.05 negative likelihood ratio). =Peritoneal lavage= Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is a controversial technique but can be used to detect injury to abdominal organs: a catheter is placed in the peritoneal cavity, and if fluid is present, it is aspirated and examined for blood or evidence of organ rupture. If this does not reveal evidence of injury, sterile saline is infused into the cavity and evacuated and examined for blood or other material. While peritoneal lavage is an accurate way to test for bleeding, it carries a risk of injuring the abdominal organs, may be difficult to perform, and may lead to unnecessary surgery; thus it has largely been replaced by ultrasound in Europe and North America. = Classification = Abdominal trauma is divided into blunt and penetrating types. While penetrating abdominal trauma (PAT) is usually diagnosed based on clinical signs, diagnosis of blunt abdominal trauma is more likely to be delayed or altogether missed because clinical signs are less obvious. Blunt injuries predominate in rural areas, while penetrating ones are more frequent in urban settings. Penetrating trauma is further subdivided into stab wounds and gunshot wounds, which require different methods of treatment.  Treatment  Initial treatment involves stabilizing the patient enough to ensure adequate airway, breathing, and circulation, and identifying other injuries. Surgery may be needed to repair injured organs. Surgical exploration is necessary for people with penetrating injuries and signs of peritonitis or shock. Laparotomy is often performed in blunt abdominal trauma, and is urgently required if an abdominal injury causes a large, potentially deadly bleed. The main goal is to stop any sources of bleeding before moving onto any definitive find and repair any injuries that are found. Due to the time sensitive nature, this procedure also emphasizes expedience in terms of gaining access and controlling the bleeding, thus favoring a long midline incision. Intra-abdominal injuries are also frequently successfully treated nonoperatively as there is little benefit shown if there is no known active bleeding or potential for infection. The use of CT scanning allows care providers to use less surgery because they can identify injuries that can be managed conservatively and rule out other injuries that would need surgery. Depending on the injuries, a patient may or may not need intensive care.  Prognosis  If abdominal injury is not diagnosed promptly, a worse outcome is associated. Delayed treatment is associated with an especially high morbidity and mortality if perforation of the gastrointestinal tract is involved.  Epidemiology  Most deaths resulting from abdominal trauma are preventable; abdominal trauma is one of the most common causes of preventable, trauma-related deaths.

Its first issue is cover dated July 1951 and its last November 1952, for a total of 5 issues. The title's creative team includes editor Sol Cohen, and artists Everett Raymond Kinstler, Louis Ravielli, Gene Fawcette, and Vince Alascia. Issue 1 presents the origin of the White Princess of the Jungle, Taanda. Historically, Taanda is predated in literature by Sheena, (a distaff Tarzan who inspired a number of comic book jungle girls), jungle lovely Rulah, and by Rima, the heroine of William Henry Hudson's novel Green Mansions (1904). Like most comics jungle girls, Taanda is white, intelligent, voluptuous, scantily clad in animal-skin bikinis, in possession of the ability to communicate with jungle beasts and birds, and wise to the ways of cruel men. Her life is devoted to preserving the peace and beauty of the jungle, confronting men up to no good, dickering with hostile, superstitious tribesmen, and exposing the deceits of bone- rattling witch doctors. Other characters who share Taanda's book include The Blue Gorilla, Captain Courage, White Hunter Jack Barnum and special guest Sheena, Queen of the Jungle. Readers are regaled with stories such as \\"Slaves of the Diamond Mines\\", \\"Coils of the Monster Snake\\", and \\"Fangs of the Swamp Beast\\". Copies of White Princess in Near Mint condition command prices in excess of $500. Stories from White Princess were reprinted in Jungle Adventures and Top Jungle Comics during the 1960s and 1970s. The comic has been cited as an example of paternalistic white savior narratives, describing a story in which \\"'fierce fighters' who were 'such simple children' begged the forgiveness of white Princess Taanda for having been hoodwinked by an unscrupulous white man who paraded as their god and had them doing vile things.\\" Further reading * Overstreet, Robert M..

However, the plant was first definitely identified as a separate species from specimens collected in Scotland in James Bolton's 1785 publication Filices Britannica. Bolton distinguished between Acrostichum ilvense and Acrostichum alpina, now Woodsia ilvensis and Woodsia alpina respectively, which had previously been conflated. The story is further confused because although Lhwyd called his find A. ilvense, and a translation of the Latin name suggests the plant we now know as W. ilvensis, examination of his specimens has shown that he collected W. alpina. The genus Woodsia was not established until 1810 by Robert Brown, who named it named after the English botanist Joseph Woods. Alpine woodsia originates as a hybrid of Woodsia ilvensis and W. glabella. The latter (commonly known as smooth woodsia) does not occur in Britain although the two species are often found together in North America. All three species are similar in appearance.Cobb, Boughton (1975) A handbook of ferns and their related families in the North American continent based on visual identification. HMCO Field Guides. . p. 148. Victorian collectors Alpine woodsia and W. ilvensis both came under severe threat from Victorian fern collectors in the mid 19th century in Scotland, especially in the Moffat Hills. This period of collecting became known as Pteridomania (or \\"fern- fever\\"). John Sadler, later a curator of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, nearly lost his life obtaining a fern tuft on a cliff near Moffat and a botanical guide called William Williams died collecting alpine woodsia in Wales in 1861.

Early life and marriage The daughter of Jack and Bluma Samuels, both Holocaust survivors, she attended public schools while growing up in Los Angeles and at the age of 10 received a Ford Foundation scholarship to study ballet at the David Lichine and Irina Kosmovska Ballet School. From ages 10 to 17 she danced with the Los Angeles Junior Ballet. When she was 17 years old she was invited by George Balanchine to attend the School of American Ballet on a Ford Foundation Scholarship. During her nine years at the New York City Ballet, under the direction of Balanchine and Jerome Robbins, she danced in Russia, Germany, Denmark, London, Paris and Washington, D.C. In 1982, Lilly Samuels married Brandon Tartikoff, Chairman of Entertainment for NBC. They had two daughters, Calla Lianne and Elizabeth Justine. In 1991, Calla, aged 8, suffered a severe brain injury in a car accident. She received intense therapy in order to walk and speak again, while Brandon received chemotherapy for the third time for Hodgkin's Disease. After a long illness, Brandon died on August 27, 1997, aged 48. In November 2009, she married Bruce Karatz, an American homebuilder and philanthropist. Philanthropic work In 1990, along with Ronald O. Perelman, Chairman and CEO of Revlon, she created the Revlon/UCLA Women's Cancer Research Program under the direction of Dr. Dennis Slamon. The annual Fire & Ice Ball in Hollywood was also established in 1990 to raise funds for this program. These funds were used to rapidly advance clinical trials which led to a new U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug, Herceptin, which increases responses and survival in women with the most aggressive form of breast cancer. Lifetime Television and Ren√©e Zellweger produced the film Living Proof Living Proof (2008) Lifetime Television Movie. Executive produced by Ren√©e Zellweger, Neil Meron, Vivienne Radkoff and Craig Zadan. which follows the true story of Lilly Tartikoff Karatz and Ronald Perelman's efforts to raise money for Dr. Dennis Slamon's cutting-edge science. The film is also based on the book HER-2Bazell, Robert. HER-2: The Making of Herceptin, a Revolutionary Treatment for Breast Cancer. Random House, October 1998. written by Robert Bazell, which chronicles Dr. Slamon's development of the drug Herceptin. The film aired on the Lifetime Channel in October 2008 during Breast Cancer Month. She co-founded the EIF Revlon Run/Walk For Women in Los Angeles with Revlon and the Entertainment Industry Foundation (EIF) in 1993 and the EIF Revlon Run/Walk For Women in New York in 1998. Since then there is an EIF Revlon Run/Walk in both Los Angeles and New York every year which continues to raise significant funds to advance cancer research. In 1997, she co-created the National Women's Cancer Research Alliance (NWCRA) along with EIF and seven leading scientists from around the nation. In 1998, she created, with EIF and the QVC shopping channel, the international \\"Cure By The Shore\\". Originally set at the International Cannes Film Festival, the event was hosted in Monte Carlo, Principality of Monaco in 2001. She partnered with Katie Couric and EIF to form the National Colorectal Cancer Research Alliance (NCCRA) in March 2000. In 2001, she launched the United Cancer Front. Dr. Slamon is the organization's Chief Scientific Director. Like those funds raised to help expedite the development of Herceptin, the United Cancer Front helped to raise badly needed, unrestricted funds to accelerate scientific discovery and delivery of breakthrough cancer therapies. In October 2000 in Washington, D.C., she received the Hope Award from the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship. In 2002 NCCS created the Lilly Tartikoff Hope Award to honor, remember and celebrate all whose lives have been touched by cancer. In October 2003, Lilly, Yves Carcelle (of Louis Vuitton) and Bob and Suzanne Wright co-chaired the first Annual Louis Vuitton United Cancer Front Gala to raise unrestricted funds for 35 of the most promising scientists to further the scientific discovery of breakthrough cancer therapies.

The committee was formed by reformists in response to sectarian clashes between Sunni and Shia members of the population. The original aims were to push for an elected popular assembly, a codified system of civil and criminal law, the establishment of an appellate court, the right to form trade unions, an end to British colonial influence (through the removal of Charles Belgrave), and an end to sectarianism. The original committee was made up of four Sunni representatives and four Shi'i representatives. The members were: * Abdulrahman al Bakir () - Secretary * Abdulaziz al Shamlan () * Ibrahim Fakhro () * Ibrahim bin Mousa () * Abdali al Alaiwat () * Sayyid Ali Kamaluddin () * Shaikh Abdullah Abudeeb () * Shaikh Mohsin al Tajir () Arrest and deportation The NUC successfully orchestrated a number of general strikes and demonstrations in the country to push for its demands. In March 1956, British Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd was visiting Bahrain. Crowds of protesters lined the streets to shout anti-British slogans and threw sand at stones at the Foreign Secretary's entourage. A number of crew members, including a stewardess, were left injured. Abdulrahman al Bakir, the secretary of the NUC, was among the leaders of the demonstrations. He was asked to leave the country after the incident for an extended stay abroad, and departed to Egypt. Al Bakir returned to Bahrain September 1956. In October 1956, the NUC called for strikes and demonstrations against the Israeli-Anglo-French attack on Egypt in the Suez Campaign. This led to days of violence in Bahrain. In November, the ruler Shaikh Salman ibn Hamad Al Khalifa (1895-1961), ordered the arrest of the NUC leaders, accusing Al Bakir, Al Shamlan and Aliwat of attempting to take his life. A specially set up court in Budaiya made up of three judges (all members of the ruling Al Khalifa family) tried the men and found them guilty. They were sentenced to 14 years at a prison located outside of Bahrain, in Saint Helena. In June 1961 the three prisoners were released from Saint Helena after a successful habeas corpus action, and were later paid financial compensation from the British government.

It was based on the 1934 play Mon Crime, written by Georges Berr and Louis Verneuil. In 1946 it was remade as Cross My Heart. Plot Helen Bartlett (Carole Lombard) is the wife of the honest lawyer Ken (Fred MacMurray). She is a \\"writer\\" but cannot think of anything to write and instead lives in her fantasy world of telling lies. When she discovers that they are broke, she attempts to get Ken to take a case of a man who stole hams. Ken, who is scrupulously honest and will not defend a client who is guilty, finds out that the man really did steal the hams, and therefore does not take the case. Helen is forced to get a job as a secretary for businessman Otto Krayler (John T. Murray), a family friend. On her first day in his sumptuous apartment/office, he attempts to seduce Helen, which causes Helen to quit the job. However, she discovers that she accidentally left her hat and coat behind. She returns with her friend Daisy McClure (Una Merkel) only to find that Krayler has been killed and $12,000 of missing money is the supposed motive. Police lieutenant Darcey (Edgar Kennedy) suspects Helen and takes her into custody. To further complicate her situation, Helen spins multiple possible accounts of the murder, discussing how she might have done it in each scenario, but finally says that she had nothing to do with it. Ken represents Helen at the trial and believes that there is no way that the jury will believe that Helen did not commit the murder, and therefore has her plead self-defense. As the trial continues, an obnoxious man named Charles \\"Charley\\" Jasper (John Barrymore) believes that Helen did not murder Krayler, but he keeps it to himself. Helen wins the case and publishes a hugely successful novel of her life story. Having earned a fortune, Helen and Ken buy a lavish home on Lake Martha, but Ken expresses remorse that their fortune has come out of crime. Helen wonders if she should confess her innocence, but Ken states that perjury would be worse than the crime she had already committed. Meanwhile, Charles visits Helen and Ken with Krayler's wallet and attempts to blackmail them into saying that he (Charley) killed Krayler and having Helen perjure herself. Helen then tells Ken that she did not kill Krayler and has Charley confess that his brother-in-law was the real murderer. Ken leaves the house, distressed by Helen's lying, but Helen chases after him and lies once more by saying that she is pregnant. For a moment, Ken believes her, but then realizes that she is lying once again. He almost walks away, but realizing that this is what life is like with a congenital fantasist, he puts Helen over his shoulder and carries her into the house, the implication being that he is going to make her lie become true by getting her pregnant.

In particular, True Confession was deemed to present perjury (as exhibited by Carole Lombard‚Äôs character, Helen Bartlett), as an evasion of ‚Äúthe processes of law‚Äù and of depicting legal scenes that were a ‚Äútravesty on the courts and the administration of justice.‚Äù Paramount was ultimately given authorization to release True Confession when Will H. Hays, president of the MPPDA, allowed that the overall ‚Äúfarcical‚Äù character of the film - a screwball comedy - was sufficient to offset the ‚Äúflippant portrayal of the courts of justice.‚ÄùKessler, 2004.

JNA was founded in 1988 in memory of late avid amateur radio operator, Jamshed N. Anklesaria (callsign: VU2JNA) who died in 1987. The organisation, currently headed by Sudhir Shah (VU2SVS) conducts classes and organises scramble teams to tackle disasters. History The organisation was formed in 1988, in memory of Jamshed N. Anklesaria who died after suffering a heart-attack in 1987. Anklesaria was a bachelor who invested much of his time amateur radio, and radio equipment. After his death, instead of selling off the equipment, Anklesaria's brother requested current secretary, to perpetuate Jamshed's memory. Shah, along with P Venkatraman and a few others then started the JNA Wireless Association with the equipment donated by Jamshed's brother. The JNA has since then organised several classes and handled disasters around the city. Classes JNA has been conducting amateur radio classes in Mumbai for over ten years. After a brief lull, JNA restarted its amateur radio classes in 2008, with two batches held at Malabar Hill and Vile Parle. Disaster management JNA has its own dedicated 70-member scrambler team and has a long history in handling disaster management. In 1993, JNA set up the first communication station at Killari, the epicenter of the 1993 Latur earthquake that killed 8,000. Headed by Sudhir Shah, JNA provided live communication between Killari and the state headquarters at Mantralaya in Mumbai. It broadcast messages relating to the extent of damage, extent of the calamity, and other life-saving messages. In 2008, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) included JNA as part of its disaster management operations to provide emergency communication support during the monsoons to provide live updates on the flooding situation in the city. Five stations were set up at Nana Chowk, Milan Subway, Kalina, Santacruz, and Chembur and were linked up to the main control centre at the BMC headquarters at Fort. In addition, another station, manned by Sha was set up at Malabar Hill with the help of the Malabar Hill Residents Association.

It is located at 42 Povarskaya Street () in the Arbat district of Moscow. The mission is housed in historical Ponizovsky House, designed by Lev Kekushev, although its exterior was later radically altered and does not display signs of Kekushev's Art Nouveau style. In 1902 Jacob Reck's development company purchased a large Volchkov estate, split it in two lots, and invited Kekushev to design two luxury mansions for resale. The better known Mindovsky House (present-day Embassy of New Zealand) was set right on the street corner, with the main entrance facing the spacious inner courtyard. Ponizovsky House was set back from Povarskaya street line, allowing a narrow strip of garden between the wall and sidewalk; its main entrance faces the corner of Povarskaya Street and Skatertny Lane. Period photographs show that the building had a flattened yet prominent dome above the main entrance and a smaller curvilinear gable above Povarskaya street facade; overall styling was reserved, with clear vertical lines of windows cut through a tiled wall. In 1914, when Kekushev was already inactive, Ponizovsky House was rebuilt to a neoclassical design, losing the dome and all original exterior finishes.

The sub plot of a man becoming a stranger amidst people speaking in a language unknown to him went on to inspire the core plot of the 2013 Hindi movie Chennai Express.https://madaboutmoviez.in/2013/08/11/chennai-express-movie- review-express-cliched-run/amp/  Plot  The story revolves around Manikyan (Mohanlal), Sreekrishnan (Nedumudi Venu) and Karthumbi (Shobana) and the love triangle between them. Initially, Manikyan and Karthumbi don't get along and get into intense arguments. But they fall in love as time goes on. Manikyan works for Sreekrishnan and Sreekrishnan sees him as a brother. Appakkala (Sreenivasan) is a servant of Sreekrishnan. Appakala is a jealous swindler who has a rivalry with Manikyan Once when they both are returning from a fair after shopping, Sreekrishnan sees Karthumbi and gets attracted. But then a fight erupts there and they all have to flee. Sreekrishnan flees alone, while Manikyan has to take Karthumbi with him. At night, he flees in the opposite direction and so loses his way. Karthumbi knows the way back, but she pretends she does not know it and enjoys the fun. Manikyan has to struggle to get out of that place. Manikyan says crude words to a shop owner, an old lady and peeked into a room with two married spouses without consent. He was tied to a tree but then untied. It was Karthumbi who caused Manikyan to land in trouble because he didn't understand what the word meant. Karthumbi later revealed that she has no house and her sister was murdered by a Mallikettu Policeman (Sharat Sexena). During that time, they fall in love. Upon returning to Manikyan's village, Sreekrishnan proposes to her and plans to marry her. Manikyan can not resist because Sreekrishnan is like an elder brother to him. But Karthumbi opposes it. When Sreekrishnan gets to know about this, he gets angry, Manikyan becomes his enemy and he tries to take revenge. One day, The Mallikettu policeman arrived and attacked Sreekrishnan. But Manikyan interfears and so he and the Mallikettu policeman engage in a fight in which Manikyan wins. The Mallikettu policeman fainted and Manikyan would chop his limbs off next time.

But they don't believe him. Karthumbi feels sympathetic to Manikyan. Manikyan runs into Appakala and is furious with Appakala spreading lies about him. Manikyan engages in a fight with Appakala. Then, the townspeople chased Manikyan and Karthumbi through the woods and the water and through the dusty road. Finally, Sreekrishnan appeared and everyone stopped chasing. Everyone in town realized that Appakalan tricked them all. He is punished by doing sit ups in front of everyone. Sreekrishnan realized his mistakes and married the woman who loved him for so long while Manikyan unites with Karthumbi.

D. Burman was initially signed in as the music composer for the film, as revealed by Burman himself in an interview to journalists in Cochin, during his visit to the city, just a few weeks before his death. But he died before he could complete the compositions of the film and was later replaced. Berny- Ignatius was accused for plagiarism for at least three of the songs in the film. The song \\"Ente Manasinoru Naanam\\" is said to be an adaptation of the popular Hindi classic \\"Piya Milanko Jaana\\", sung by Pankaj Mullick. Another song in the film, \\"Nila Pongal\\" is accused to be an imitation of a Bengali song, \\"Sun Mere Bandhu Re\\". The \\"Manam Thelinje vanne\\" song is a copy of the Ilayaraja song \\"Aasai athigam vechu\\" from the Tamil movie \\"Marupadiyum\\". Berny-Ignatius were awarded the Kerala State Film Award for Best Music Director despite the allegations, which created a controversy. Veteran music director G.

He is a Catholic martyr, beatified in 1929. Life He was over forty when he went to Douay College to study for the priesthood; no details have been preserved of his earlier life. He arrived there on 18 September 1604; received the minor orders on 16 December 1605; the subdiaconate on 26 October 1607; the diaconate on 31 May 1608; and the priesthood on the following day. On 14 October he started for England, but was driven onto the shores of Scotland, arrested, and imprisoned for three years. On obtaining his liberty he came to England where he worked for thirty years, twenty of which he spent in various prisons. He was zealous and fiery by temperament, severe with himself and others, and especially devoted to hearing confessions. Though he had the reputation of being a very exacting director, his earnestness drew to him many penitents. He was in London when Parliament issued the proclamation of 7 April 1641, banishing all priests under pain of death, but refused to retire, and on 15 July was arrested in the house of his nephew. Six days later he was brought to trial at the Old Bailey and was condemned on 23 July. He was executed on the feast of St. Anne, to whom he ever had a great devotion. An oil portrait, painted shortly after the martyrdom from memory or possibly from an earlier sketch, is preserved at St. Edmund's College, Ware.

Mohanlal also sang a song (\\"Vazhiyoram\\") with Chithra for the film. The story is about the love between a violinist played by Mohanlal and a terminally ill girl played by Urvashi. The music and background score were composed by Raveendran.  Plot  In the first scene, we are shown an old man named Venu (Mohanlal) who came with flowers to strew his lady's grave. The story is narrated through his memories. Venu was an educated young man who worked for a wealthy businessman Menon (Thilakan) at his tea plantation. After being fired, he tried to get his job back by playing music for Menon's only daughter, Sarojam (Urvashi) Sarojam eventually falls in love with Venu and expresses her wish to marry him. Wanting to keep her unawares about her fatal condition, aplastic anaemia, Menon was ready to do anything for her. Menon tells Venu about the illness and asks him whether he was ready for the marriage. Menon offers him all the wealth and the complete authority of his family business. Venu, whose family is in a dire state, accepts the offer and marries Sarojam. Initially, he pretended to love her as he felt sympathetic for her and wanted to make her happy always. However, gradually he falls in true love with her and an inseparable relation blossoms between them. Sarojam gives birth to a daughter, Ammu. When Ammu is a few years old, Sarojam develops severe symptoms of the disease. Dr. Menon (Soman) suggests that bone marrow transplant may lead to a recovery in her. After the bone marrow transplant, Sarojam seem to recover but soon her condition worsens and she dies in the hands of Venu. Then we are shown the first scene, which was Venu standing aside Sarojam's grave. After a while, Unni, a close friend of Venu comes there to inform him that his daughter Ammu is also affected with the same disease. Venu is shocked but he was not allowed to cry even as Ammu should never know about this. The heartbroken Venu returns to his bungalow with Ammu. There he has a strange visitor named Hari ( Vineeth), an unemployed young man, who comes there with a recommendation letter for a job. Soon, Venu realizes that, what has happened in his and Sarojam's life is getting repeated in his daughter's life too, through Hari. He allows Hari to stay there and in the last scene, Venu calls Hari to his room, in the same way as he was called by Menon for Sarojam's proposal.

The Mass does not correspond to the Divine Office for the day on which it is celebrated. Every day in the year has appointed to it a series of canonical hours and (except Good Friday) a Mass corresponding, containing, for instance, the same collect and the same gospel. Normally the Mass corresponds to the Office, but on occasion, may not. History The principle of the votive Mass is older than its name. Almost at the very origin of the Western liturgies (with their principle of change according to the Calendar) Mass was occasionally offered, apparently with special prayers and lessons, for some particular intention, irrespective of the normal Office of the day. Among the miracles quoted by Augustine of Hippo in \\"De civ. Dei\\", XXII, 8, is the story of one Hesperius cured of an evil spirit by a private Mass said in his house with special prayers for him‚Äîa votive Mass for his cure. The first sacramentaries contain many examples of what we should call votive Masses. So the Leonine book has Masses \\"in natale episcoporum\\" (ed. Feltoe, pp. 123‚Äì26), \\"de siccitate temporis\\" (ed. Feltoe, 142), \\"contra impetitores\\" (ed. Feltoe, 27), and so on throughout. Indeed, the Masses for ordination and for the dead, which occur in this book and throughout the Roman Rite and Gallican Rite, are examples of votive Masses for all kinds of occasions, for ordinations (ed. Wilson, pp. 22‚Äì30, etc.), for those about to be baptized (ed. Wilson 34), anniversaries of ordinations (153-54), nuns (156), for the sick (282), for marriages (265), kings (276), travellers (283), the dead (301 sq.), and a large collection of Masses of general character to be said on any Sunday (224-44). In this book the name first occurs, \\"Missa votiva in sanctorum commemoratione\\" (p. 367; Rheinau and S. Gallen MSS.). The Gregorian Sacramentary, too, has a large collection of such Masses and the name \\"Missa votiva\\" (e.g., Patrologia Latina, LXXVIII, 256). Throughout the Middle Ages the votive Mass was a regular institution. The principle came to be that, whereas one official (capitular) high Mass was said corresponding to the Office, a priest who said a private Mass for a special intention said a votive Mass corresponding to his intention. The great number of forms provided in medieval Missals furnished one for any possible intention. Indeed, it seems that at one time a priest normally said a votive Mass whenever he celebrated. John Beleth in the thirteenth century describes a series of votive Masses once said (fuit quoddam tempus) each day in the week: on Sunday, of the Holy Trinity; Monday, for charity; Tuesday, for wisdom; Wednesday, of the Holy Ghost; Thursday, of the Angels; Friday, of the Cross; Saturday, of the Blessed Virgin (Explic. div. offic., 51). This completely ignores the ecclesiastical year. But there was a general sentiment that, at least on the chief feasts, even private Masses should conform to the Office of the day. The Feast of the Holy Trinity began as a votive Mass to be said on any Sunday after Pentecost, when there was no feast.  Bible and doctrine  The Solemnity of Pentecost celebrates Jesus gift of the Holy Spirit God to the Apostolic Church, followed by its power of remitting sins and exorcizing demons, like Jesus did in His miracles. The Lord hastened to St Peter the same authority, appointing him as the first pope (\\"rock\\") of the Church. The same charisms of the Holy Spirit God were used and revealed by Jesus Christ God in the Harrowing of Hell, and also are attributed to the St Michael the Archangel, whose exorcistic prayer (called \\"Exorcism against Satan and the apostatic angels\\") is able to win Satan and all the angels pertaning to his mystical body. The Bible also mentions Raphael the archangel and the Book of Tobit against the strong demon Asmodeus.  Suffrage Mass  The Suffrage Mass is a particular type of Votive Mass in which one or more Roman Catholic baptized believers ask to the celebrating priest to offer a Mass to God in favour of the salvation of one or more souls temporary living in the Purgatory. While the Holy Mass is always offered to God, it can also be dedicated to one or more Roman Catholic saints in order to ask their intercessory prayer to God. The Council of Trent stated the belief in the intercession of saints as a canon any Roman Catholic is obliged to believe. For the Roman Catholic doctrine, any saint may pray God to intercede his divine grace in favour of any human living being, but within a hierarchical order of intercessory power: first Jesus Christ God by way of Mass (worship), secondly the Blessed Virgin Mary (hyperdulia), thirdly Saint Joseph (protodulia), and lastly the hierarchy of angels. The pious practice of the Suffrage Mass is also founded on the belief in the existence of the Purgatory. For the Roman Catholic faith, at the time of the death there is a separation of the soul form the earthly body. The soul undergoes to the particular judgment of God who is Omniscient and therefore can't fail in his judgement. The judgement is based on the personal sins and merits of salvation acquired during the earthly life. The sol can't do anything to improve its afterlife condition after the death. There are three possible judgements of God corresponding to as many possible destinations of the soul: Paradise, Purgatory and Hell. Solely the soul who died in sanctity, to say without any stain of personal sin and also without the original sin, can be admitted in Paradise. Otherwise, if they have committed some mortal sins which weren't absolved by a priest before their death, the destination is the Purgatory. The soul is believed to stay in Purgatory for a finite time in order to repair its sins and have them forgiven by God. Thi is a concern for all the sins that weren't confessed and [Absolution#Roman Catholic Churchabsolved before the death. The expiation is necessary before the expiating souls can be admitted in Paradise. The number of months or of years of its duration is believed to be proportional to the gravity of the guilts committed during the earthly life. The Suffrage Mass is believed to have the power to shorten the expiating period if God decides to grant the grace of a lower penalty for the souls to which the Mass is directed. The prayer of saints to God can contribute to reach the same purpose. When the expiation time had finished, St Michael the Archangel is believed to go in the Purgatory to liberate the expiating souls and bring them in Paradise. Paradise is dedicated to the vision of the truth and contemplation of the Face of God, which is the highest and last purpose of the human life. There, hierarchy of angels and souls pray and worship God, and live forever in communion while waiting the expiating souls of the Purgatory be definitely saved and any souls can get its resurrected flesh at the end of times. Rulings This idea of allowing votive Masses to be said only when no special feast occurs finally produced the rules contained in later missals (1570). According to these, there is a distinction between votive Masses strictly so called and votive Masses in a wider sense. The first are those commanded to be said on certain days; the second kind, those a priest may say or not, at his discretion. Strict votive Masses are, first, those ordered by the rubrics of the Missal, namely a Mass of the Blessed Virgin on every Saturday in the year not occupied by a double, semi-double, octave, vigil, feria of Lent, or ember-day, or the transferred Sunday Office (Rubr. Gen., IV, 1). This is the \\"Missa de S. Maria\\" in five forms for various seasons, among the votive Masses at the end of the Missal. To this we must add votive Masses ordered by the pope or the ordinary for certain grave occasions (pro re gravi). Such are for the election of a pope or bishop, in time of war, plague, persecution, and so on. Such votive Masses may be ordered by the ordinary on all days except doubles of the first or second class, Ash Wednesday, and the ferias of Holy Week, the eves of Christmas and Pentecost; except also days on which the office is said for the same intention or event as would be prescribed by the votive Mass. In this case the Mass should conform to the office as usual. A third kind of strictly votive Mass is that said during the devotion of the so-called \\"Forty Hours\\". On this occasion the Mass on the first and third days is of the Blessed Sacrament; on the second day it is for peace. But on doubles of the first and second class, Sundays of the first and second class, on Ash Wednesday, in Holy Week, during the octaves of Epiphany, Easter, Pentecost, on the eves of Christmas and Pentecost, the Mass of the day must be said, with the collect of the Blessed Sacrament added to that of the day under one conclusion. The other kind of votive Mass (late sumpta) may be said by any priest on a semidouble, simple or feria, at his discretion, except on Sunday, Ash Wednesday, the eves of Christmas, Epiphany, Pentecost, during the octaves of Epiphany, Easter, Pentecost, Corpus Christi, Holy Week, and on All Souls' Day. Nor may a votive Mass be said on a day whose Office is already that of the same occasion; but in this case the corresponding Mass of the day must be said, according to the usual rubrics. A votive Mass may be taken from any of those at the end of the missal, or of the common of Saints, or of their propers, if the text does not imply that it is their feast. A Sunday or ferial Mass may not be used as a votive Mass. Nor may it be said of a Beatus, unless this is allowed by special indult. The Gloria is to be said in votive Masses pro re gravi unless the colour be violet; also in votive Masses of the Blessed Virgin on Saturday, of angels, whenever said, in those of saints, when said on a day on which they are named in the Martyrology or during their octaves. The Creed is said in solemn votive Masses pro re gravi. The first and third Masses of the Forty Hours have the Gloria and the Creed, not the Mass for Peace (but if said on a Sunday it has the Creed). Solemn votive Masses have only one collect; others are treated as semidoubles, with commemorations of the day, etc., according to the usual rule. The colour used for a votive Mass corresponds to the event celebrated, except that red is used for Holy Innocents. It is red for the election of a pope, white for the anniversary of a bishop's election or consecration, violet in the general case of asking for some special grace and for the Passion. The particular case of votive Masses for each day of the week, corresponding to votive Offices ordered by Pope Leo XIII, was abolished by the Decree \\"Divino afflatu\\" of 1 November 1911. Requiems and Masses for marriages are really particular cases of a votive Mass.

The civil parish boundary between Felsted and Great and Little Leighs crosses the priory, so that it partially lies in Felsted and partially in Great and Little Leighs. The priory was designated a Grade I listed building in 1952. History In 1220, Sir Ralph Gernon decided that the hamlet of Leez, in a dip by the banks of the River Ter, would provide the perfect location on which to found a house of Augustinian canons. The priory of St. Mary and St. John the Evangelist thrived for over 300 years. King Henry VIII sent Sir Richard Rich to dismiss the monastery, during the Dissolution of the Monasteries (1536-1541). When Sir Richard Rich, 3rd Baron Rich became the Earl of Warwick, he built his own great house on the site that is now known as Leez Priory. The remains of the Augustinian Priory are very much in evidence within the grounds to the south of the existing buildings, including extensive underground drainage conduits. Known as \\"Delicious Leez\\", both the site and the rose-brick buildings are breathtaking, with old garden walls and fish ponds indicative of life and times past. In the years that followed, the mansion has been home to the Earls of Warwick and has been visited by Queen Elizabeth I, Princess Mary and many other nobles from the past. In his recent book on the origins of the English Civil War, John Adamson has emphasised the magnificence and political radicalism of Leez Priory in the 17th century. He concludes that in 1640 Leez and its owner, Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick, were probably the ‚Äútopographical and moral centre‚Äù of opposition to the King.Adamson, John, The Noble Revolt, (London : Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2007) pp. 25‚Äì26 Much of it was demolished in 1753. At this time the property was purchased by Guy's Hospital, London. Guy's Hospital were still the owners in 1910, and for some time the property had been rented out as a private residence. The priory was designated a Grade I listed building in 1952. In 1995, Leez Priory was the first country house in the UK to be licensed to hold civil ceremonies.

After that early collection, he recorded 11 collections which have been translated into 28 languages, and won ASCAP's \\"Award for Special Contributions to the Field of Music\\" six times. His songs include: The Best of Ray Repp Vol. 1 & 2 and Yesterday, Today & Tomorrow, all songs written from 1965‚Äì1985. Repp's music has been recorded by those outside the Catholic Church. Christian punk outfit Undercover and Christian rocker Phil Keaggy have covered Repp's work on their own discs. He also recorded non-religious material. \\"Don't Go In the Street\\" and \\"Apple Pie,\\" both from The Time Has Not Come True, featured sometimes humorous, prescient left-leaning social commentary. Repp drew a measure of notoriety from the mainstream journalistic media in 1997 when he sued composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, asserting that Lloyd Webber had plagiarized portions of his \\"Phantom Song\\" from his own composition \\"Till You.\\" Lloyd Webber, however, cross-litigated in counter-accusation that Repp had, in turn, plagiarized portions of \\"Till You\\" from \\"Close Every Door,\\" from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. Repp ultimately lost the case. He was married to, and lived with, his husband of twenty years, Richard Alther, a writer and painter, in their homes in Southern California and Vermont. Alther wrote \\"The Decade of Blind Dates,\\" about his past relationships as a homosexual divorcee, and his marriage to Repp.  Early life  Repp was born in St. Louis, Missouri, to Walter and Rita Kempf Repp, the eldest of their nine children. He was educated in Catholic schools: Seven Holy Founders Elementary School, St. Louis Preparatory Seminary, Cardinal Glennon College, and Kenrick Seminary, with graduate studies at St. Paul's Seminary, Ottawa, Canada. Later he studied music and languages in Vienna, Austria.  Theology  Repp as one of the first artists to employ the idiom of popular 1960's folk music within Roman Catholic worship (liturgical) music. While clearly not neglecting vertical theology in his compositions, Repp was a major proponent of horizontal theology (i.e. emphasis on social justice themes and 'love of neighbor') in Christian music. In a tribute to Repp by David Haas, another Catholic singer- songwriter, Repp is quoted as having said: \\"Latin philosophy and theology textbooks could hardly hold my attention from the books of my new heroes: Deikmann, Davis, Jungman. I was writing music at the same time, usually secretly in my small seminary room. But liturgical music? The thought never crossed my mind. If my music hadn't been officially banned in dozens of U.S. dioceses, it probably would never have caught on. My songs were written out of my frustrations then at seeing little concern for the neglected Hispanics and Blacks in Utah, not only by Mormons but my own affluent Catholics.\\" Repp added, \\"If our music is to praise God, it can only do so by helping to change us and our communities into more sensitive, loving, and just human beings.\\" Perhaps the best summary of Repp's theology can be found in Song of Micah in his 1985 work, Ever Bless. This song is based on Micah 6:3‚Äì8: > This is all I ask of you, this is the only praise I seek: That your love be > gentle and your lives be just, and humbly walk along with me. Should we go > before the Lord, bowing low, and giving praise? Will the Lord be pleased > with gifts we have to bring, with songs we want to sing? Should we make some > sacrifice? Should we offer up our lives to the Lord on high? How shall we > adore the Lord forevermore? My people hear me, what have I done ‚Äì that you > distrust so my gift of love? What will the Lord be satisfied by our gifts > and songs of praise? Will the Lord be pleased, what honor can we give? > Should we change the way we live?  Writing  In 2018, Repp published his first book, TABLE TALES: Do Ahead Dinner Party Menus That Whet Appetites, Loosen Tongues, and Make Memories.  Death  Repp died on April 26, 2020, after battling both lymphoma and metastatic melanoma, the latter the cause of his death.

Because of its great number and well-built organization, it is considered as the biggest Adabi Tanzeem (literary organization) of Asia. It was in 1952 that Abdul Ghafoor Ansari and Nooruddin Sarki coined in Sindhi Adabi Sangat. It initially was restricted to literary activities in Karachi. However, envied by the circles it soon multiplied to have branches all over Sindh and has now branches oversees as well. In 1952, Noor-ud-din Sarki and Abdul Ghafoor Ansari restructured the literary forum of Sindhi language and called it Sindhi Adabi Sangat. Initially its activities were confined to the city of Karachi. Inspired by the success of its activities in Karachi, interest developed over the rest of Sindh. This led to the launch of other branches in other parts of Sindh as well. Realizing the growing popularity of Sindhi Adabi Sangat, it was invited for the first time as a group in the 'Eighteenth Sindhi Adabi Conference' in April 1956 at Larkana by Jamait-ul-shoora-e-Sindh. Taking the advantage of the opportunity, the Sangat called upon the friends for the central organization of the Sangat. That is how Sindhi Adabi Sangat formed at the central level in 1956 with Ayaz Qadri as its Secretary and its report was published in quarterly Mehran. There are two opinions as regards the origin of Sindhi Adabi Sangat: some believe that the group in the first place was formed before the independence of Pakistan in 1947, while the others suggest that it started after the independence. A report published in the August 1947 issue of the monthly magazine Naeen Dunya, mentioned that: a meeting of Sindhi writers' was called at 'Babrs Shippers chamber' on last Sunday. The meeting was presided over by Prof. M.U Malkani where among many other writers were present the literary veterans like Lal Chand Dino Mal, Aasanand Mamtura, Chohar Mal Hinduja, Manohar Das Koromal, Jeratti Subani, Sobho Gianchandani, Gobind Malhi, Bihari Chabra, Anand Golani, Kerith Babani, Mohan Punjabi, and Bhagwan Lalvani. It is believed that Ghobind Malhi was the first secretary to Sindhi Adabi Sangat which was formed during March‚ÄìApril 1947. However, it did not survive the independence of Pakistan. Taj Baloch, Shamsherul Haidri, Anwar Pirzado, Abdul Rehman Pirzado Yousif Sindhi, Dr Zulfiqar Siyal, Dr Adal Soomro and Taj Joyo have been active members of Sangat in sixties, seventies and eighties. Whatever the case be, Sindhi Adabi Sangat in its present form commenced in 1952.

He was the eldest child of the 2nd Earl and his wife Arabella Mainwaring-Ellerker (died 1782). On 21 July 1818 he married Mary Fludyer, eldest daughter of George Fludyer of Ayston, County Rutland, esquire and of Lady Margaret Fane, daughter of the 9th Earl of Westmoreland. They had two children - *Mary Augusta (b. 4 June 1819) *Arthur George (16 June 1820 - 2 August 1856, predeceased), married 1 August 1850 Lady Katherine Anne Cust (born 1822), 4th daughter of John, 1st Earl Brownlow. They had 3 daughters. The 3rd Earl's wife predeceased him on 1 March 1830. His son died without surviving male issue of his own. On the Earl's death the Earl was succeeded by his grandnephew, William (b. 1853). He had a large Napoleonic collection and reportedly, on visiting the Louvre with Paul Delaroche in 1848, he commented on the implausibility and theatricality of David's painting Napoleon Crossing the Alps. He commissioned Delaroche to produce a more accurate version which featured Napoleon on a mule, entitled Bonaparte Crossing the Alps. Two versions survive, one at Liverpool and one at the Louvre. Elizabeth Foucart-Walker asserts that in fact the Louvre version of the ensuing work was produced first as it was already in America by 1850, when the Liverpool painting was produced. Stephen Bann suggests that Arthur George's meeting with Delaroche may have occurred, but Delaroche chose to produce two works that are almost identical and send one to America.Bann, Stephen, 'Delaroche, Napoleon and English Collectors, Apollo, October, 2005, 30 References *Arthur George Onslow, 3rd Earl of Onslow in Debrett's Peerage for 1840 *Debrett's for 1861 Category:1777 births Category:1870 deaths 3 ","title":"Arthur Onslow, 3rd Earl of Onslow"},{"id":"18002696","text":"The Petit V√©lan is a mountain of the Swiss Pennine Alps, located south of Bourg-Saint-Pierre in the canton of Valais.

Suresh Kumar as Himself Production Dennis Joseph got the plot idea from a friend of his named Harikumar, who is also actor Ashokan's brother. Initially, Joshiy and Joseph thought about casting newcomers in the principal roles. However, Joshiy later decided it to be a Mohanlal-starrer. Subsequently, the age of the characters were increased to make them youngsters rather than teenagers; Jagadish and Maniyanpilla Raju were added as Mohanlal's buddies. Some of the scenes were based on Joseph's own experience from his train journeys. Originally, Jagathy Sreekumar was fixed in the role of the actor the youngsters meet on their train journey. But a day before the filming began, Mohanlal suggested to cast Mammootty in the actor's role and to swap Sreekumar to one of the TTE's roles. Joseph and Joshiy liked the idea but was skeptical whether Mammootty would agree to do a supporting role in a film with Mohanlal in the leading role, since mid-1980s both the actors have attained stardom and have been appearing only in equally important roles or otherwise cameos, nevertheless, Joseph asked Mammootty who immediately agreed without hesitation. The interior scenes of the train was shot inside an original moving train to avoid artificial feeling of using sets. For that, they bought a Nilambur‚ÄìShoranur route train for rent and drove it to places to and fro for filming.  Soundtrack The film contains only a single song \\"Pichakappoonkaavukal\\" composed by Ouseppachan and sung by M. G. Sreekumar, lyrics were by Shibu Chakravarthy. This song was later reused in the film Husbands in Goa (2012). The background score was composed by S. P. Venkatesh. A. R. Rahman did the keyboard programming whereas Vidyasagar assisted Ouseppachan in the recording of the song \\"Pichakappoonkaavukal\\".

He reached his career-high singles ranking of World No. 317 in June 2009 and his career-high doubles ranking of World No. 147 in May 2011. In February 2009, Eaton played what was then, the longest tennis match in history, lasting 6 hrs 40 mins, eventually beating James Ward. This was a play-off match to decide the Davis Cup team, but it was not sanctioned by the ATP so was not an official record, and it was broken later. Early and personal life He learnt to play tennis at Reed's School. He was nicknamed the \\"Eaton Rifle\\" due to his big serve. He was coached by Justin Sherring from 8 to 16 yrs old. Junior career Eaton reached a career high of No. 97 in April 2005 at age 17 and 4 months. In his only singles main draw junior grand slam match, and his final match as a junior, he lost to Donald Young at Wimbledon in 2005, 1‚Äì6, 5‚Äì7.ITF Junior Activity for Eaton, itftennis.com; accessed 11 July 2016. Senior career2007= Eaton's best results in 2007 were two Futures championships in doubles in Israel and Great Britain, and a singles semifinal appearance in Israel F4 in November, where he beat No. 839 Amir Hadad. He finished 2007 ranked No. 656 in singles play. =2008= Eaton made little singles progress in the first 4 months of the year. But he had much success in doubles, making the doubles finals of 5 Futures and winning two of them. In June, he had a breakthrough singles win in the 2nd round of qualifying at Nottingham, beating his first top-100 opponent, No. 90 Guillermo Garc√≠a L√≥pez, before losing to No. 111 Vince Spadea in the final qualifying round. He followed that up the next week as a wild card by qualifying in singles for the Wimbledon Championships, beating No. 140 Mikhail Kukushkin, No. 206 Jan Min√°≈ô, and No. 162 Olivier Patience, scoring 32 aces in that match. He was also given a wild card into the main doubles draw with Alexander Slabinsky. In the Wimbledon Championships first round he beat Serbia's Boris Pasanski 6‚Äì3 7‚Äì6(8‚Äì6) 6‚Äì4. He then faced Russia's Dmitry Tursunov, the number 25 seed in the second round on Court One, his first show- court appearance, but he could not continue his winning streak and Eaton lost 6‚Äì7(2), 2‚Äì6, 4‚Äì6. As a result of his performance at Wimbledon, Eaton's ranking rose to a career high of 386, which made him eligible for Challenger events. =2009= Having played little more than a few Futures at the start of the year, Eaton was thrust into play-offs, between six British tennis hopefuls, designed by John Lloyd to help pick the two singles players to represent Great Britain in the Euro/Africa Zone Group I tie against Ukraine. Eaton started well, defeating Alexander Slabinsky 6‚Äì4 6‚Äì4 2‚Äì6 7‚Äì6 (7‚Äì5). He then beat James Ward 6‚Äì3 6‚Äì2 6‚Äì7 (3‚Äì7) 2‚Äì6 21‚Äì19 in a gruelling match lasting six hours and 40 minutes, making it the longest match in history prior to the epic Isner-Mahut match at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships. Lloyd had decided he had seen enough, and chose Eaton and Joshua Goodall as the two players to represent Britain alongside Colin Fleming and Ross Hutchins. Eaton lost his first Davis Cup match 6‚Äì3, 3‚Äì6, 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì4 to Ukrainian number 1 Sergiy Stakhovsky but managed to restore some pride to Team GB, who were on the verge of a whitewash before Eaton managed to beat Illya Marchenko 6‚Äì3, 4‚Äì6, 7‚Äì6 in the remaining dead rubber. Despite putting in one of the better performances by British players other than Andy Murray in the Davis Cup recently, Eaton didn't appear in the plans of captain John Lloyd for forthcoming fixtures. =2010= At Wimbledon Eaton and doubles partner Dominic Inglot beat the defending champions Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjic in the second round, to achieve his best Slam result with a third round appearance. Eaton began playing touchtennis as a pastime against other former professional tennis players as well as current park players and rank amateurs. He has won one title and hosted a weekly tennis phone in show on the sports website.Profile, touchtennis.com; accessed 11 July 2016. =2012= Eaton played his last match in the Wimbledon qualifying second round. =2016= Chris Eaton joined the Wake Forest men's tennis staff as an assistant coach in the 2016-17 season.

Martela worked at the Riihim√§ki woodworking company that he himself had founded. He had good relations to business circles and knew that there was demand for new office furniture. His idea was groundbreaking in its simplicity: create a company in Finland that would develop and market sensibly designed office furniture according to the new office standards. Martela, then called Tehokaluste Oy, was established in 1945. Operations did not begin with production first, as with many competitors. Instead, the company focused on designing products and marketing them to customers. The founders of the company with business degrees were Matti S. Martela, Henrik Virkkunen, Unto Eskola and Jonne Jahnukainen, plus Svante Nurmiranta and interior architect Wladimir Rumjantsew. Even before the company had been property established, Matti S. Martela had received orders for Tehokaluste from his future key client ‚Äì the Finnish Government. He had offered the Director of the Resettlement Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, Veikko Vennamo, writing desks designed by interior architect Rumjantsew. Vennamo initially ordered fifty desks, but before the company had time even to deliver these, another order arrived for fifty more. A hundred desks was such a major order for the young company that it supported operations for the first months. The government continued to be Tehokaluste's biggest client throughout the 1940s. The first order began a healthy relationship with the Finnish Government's central procurement unit that lasted for decades. *Martela history (Website of Martela 60 years anniversary in 2005) ReferencesExternal links *Website of Martela Group *Website of Martela 60 years anniversary in 2005 Category:Companies based in Helsinki Category:Companies listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange Category:Furniture companies of Finland ","title":"Martela"},{"id":"18002901","text":"At Montreux Jazz Festival is a 1998 album by Israeli singer Ofra Haza.

The SNP is located in exon 3 of the gene and the change between C and T results in a change between histidine (His) and tyrosine (Tyr) at the 452nd amino acid, i.e., it is a missense substitution. As 5-HT2A is a neuroreceptor the SNP has been investigated in connection with neuropsychiatric disorders and other brain-related variables. A 2003 study looked at memory performance and found that His/His subjects performed better. Another study reported that the SNP had an effect on the memory performance in young adults.

Five parts by Marivaux appeared from May 1734 to April 1735, and an ending was added by another writer. The work is supposedly the original for subsequent tales of poor boys of a heroic nature who have \\"made good\\". The change in style is noticeable from Marivaux's literary style to the more racy conclusion written by the other author. Summary of plot Jacob is the son of a poor peasant farmer in provincial France, and the family usually transport the wines of the local estate owner. Jacob ends up in the estate owner's house in Paris as a sort of servant, where a serving girl Genevieve falls in love with him. The master encourages them to get married with the thinly disguised attempt of keeping her as a mistress but paying Jacob handsomely. Jacob refuses to take part in this but is on the point of being forced to agree when the master dies. He leaves nothing but debts and the household is broken up. Jacob sets off for home, and on the way passes through the town. A lady has collapsed on the bridge and Jacob picks her up and takes her home before she dies of exposure or exhaustion. She is the younger of a pair of pious middle aged sisters living together. The younger is so grateful to Jacob that she wants to help him, and Jacob is allowed to stay for the night. The interfering director (their religious advisor) does not like Jacob and stirs the elder against him. Eventually the two sisters fall into a row about him, and the younger leaves home, finding lodgings where Jacob can also stay, with Mme d‚ÄôAlain and her disagreeable daughter. Eventually they decide to get married, but this results in severe opposition from the elder and the director who put every obstacle in their way, including an interview with the magistrate. However Jacob charms the company, including the influential and attractive Mme de Ferval, and so the marriage is allowed to proceed. On the way home from the interview Jacob gets involved in a domestic dispute where a man stabs his girlfriend, leaving Jacob to pick up the sword and get arrested. He spends some days in prison before his innocence is established, and finally marries Mlle Halbert. Mme de Ferval takes an interest in Jacob and recommends him to M. de Fercourt a powerful financier who can offer him a job. However, as he is offered the job there is an appeal from an attractive girl Mme d'Orville and her mother, whose husband has just been thrown out of the job. Jacob magnanimously gives up the offer provided the husband, who is very ill is allowed to keep the job. Mme de Ferval arranges a secret rendez-vous with Jacob, but the occasion is lost when a young officer bursts in thinking there was someone else there. Jacob realises the situation he has got himself into and the nature of Mme de Ferval and gets away. In another adventure he manages to save the life of a man who has been set upon by three villains. Jacob is going to the opera with this Compte d'Orsan, when the text of Marivaux finishes. An apocryphal suite has been written in which M. d'Orville turns out to be a wealthy man who can give Jacob a good position. Jacob's elder brother reappears after his marriage goes badly wrong and his profligate wife leaves him bankrupt. D'Orsan also introduces Mme De Vambures a wealthy widow. Jacob's wife dies and so he is free to set his hand at Mme de Vambures. Eventually they marry as do D'Orsan and Mme d'Orville. Jacob becomes wealthy and eventually his wife buys for him the estate in the village in which he grew up He therefore returns a wealthy man to meet his parents. He has three children and he also brings up his nephews and all are settled in good positions. Eventually all situations resolve themselves happily.

Legendary Texas Ranger Captain Bill McDonald was dispatched to Columbus to restore order. Background and violence The feud was a culmination of several factors, but mostly resulted due to the local Sheriffs race that placed incumbent Sam Reese against former Deputy Larkin Hope. Former state senator Mark Townsend, who had been the deciding factor for the past nine sheriffs due to his political connections, had pulled his support away from Sheriff Reese, throwing in behind Hope. This led to tensions between those in support of Reese, and the Townsend faction. Townsend's support of Hope all but insured his victory. However, on August 3, 1898, Constable Larkin Hope was shot and killed by an unknown assailant in downtown Columbus. Jim Coleman, a close friend to Sheriff Reese's sons Walter and Herbert, was the initial suspect. Townsend immediately chose another candidate, Will Burford, who with Townsend's support won an easy victory, becoming the newly elected Sheriff of Colorado County. However, the previous tensions were anything but over. On March 16, 1899, Mark Townsend, Will Clements, and Marion Hope, brother of the dead Larkin Hope, engaged Sam Reese and his supporters in a gunfight in downtown Columbus, during which Reese's supporters fled, resulting in Reese being shot and killed. Bystander Charles Boehme was also killed, and a boy named Johnny Williams was wounded. Although evidence and witness statements indicated that Reese provoked the gunfight, his sons vowed they would seek revenge. On May 17, 1899, January 15, 1900, July 31, 1900, June 30, 1906, and May 17, 1907, five more separate gunfights took place in Columbus, resulting in Dick Reese, brother to Sam, Sheriff Burford's son Arthur, Will Clements brother Hiram and Jim Coleman being killed. Dick Gant, another bystander, was also killed during one of the gunfights, and numerous bystanders and participants were wounded. Feuds end, aftermath The shooters during all those fights were Mark Townsend, Jim Townsend, Step Yates, Will Clements, Walter Reese, Joe Lessing, Frank Burford, and Marion Hope, which ironically were all related by either blood or marriage, despite their hatred of one another. The citizens appealed to the city council to re-establish the office of Town Marshal, abolished some years earlier. However, the council refused. Texas Rangers were dispatched, to include James Brooks, which effectively ended the violence in 1907. Despite each being unrelated to the feud itself, two of the main participants did die in later gunbattles. Marion Hope died in a vehicle accident in 1911. That same year, Will Clements was shot from ambush in Matagorda County, Texas by a man with whom he had had an altercation a few days earlier. Jim Townsend was also killed in 1911, in a gun battle with a saloon keeper in Louise, Texas. Herbert Reese was killed in 1912, when a gun he was cleaning in his Columbus home accidentally discharged. Walter Reese died in an automobile accident in El Paso, Texas in 1919.

It should not be confused with majority party. According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary: Major parties hold a significant percentage of the vote in elections and claim higher membership than minor parties. Typically, major parties have the most donors, best-organized support networks and excellent funding for elections. Their candidates for political positions are closely watched since they have the highest chance of being elected to office because of the high membership, recognition and donations that these parties are able to generate. Two major parties can lead to a two-party system. If there is only one major party, then it is a dominant-party system. In a multi-party system, a major party is one that occasionally controls the presidency or premiership and is the most influential party in a coalition government.

The station is owned by iHeartMedia and the broadcast license is held by iHM Licenses, LLC. The station was assigned the WRNX call letters by the Federal Communications Commission on September 21, 1990. Programming WRNX airs a country music format. The format change to country music from WRNX's longtime adult album alternative format was part of sister station WPKX's move to the Hartford, Connecticut market, where it became WUCS. In addition to its usual music programming, WRNX has served as the flagship station for University of Massachusetts Amherst athletics broadcasts. The station has carried all of the school's men's basketball, hockey and football games plus coaches shows and women's basketball games since 2002. Ownership In spring 2003, Pamal Broadcasting Ltd. (James Morrell, chairman/CEO) reached an agreement to acquire WPNI and WRNX from Western Massachusetts Radio Co. (Thomas G. Davis, president), for a reported sale price of $8 million. The broker for this transaction was Doug Ferber of Star Media Group, Inc. At the time of the purchase, WRNX broadcast a rock- leaning adult album alternative music format. In the summer of 2006, iHeartMedia, under its former name of Clear Channel Communications (John Hogan, CEO, radio), reached an agreement to acquire WRNX from Pamal Broadcasting Ltd (James Morrell, chairman/CEO) in exchange for five radio stations on other states. The other stations in the deal are WBPM and WGHQ in upstate New York, WZRT and WSYB in Rutland, Vermont, and WPYR in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

Administrative authority The supreme administrator and steward of to all ecclesiastical temporalities is the Pope, in virtue of his primacy of governance.Code of Canon Law, canon 1273 The pope's power in this connection is solely administrative, as he cannot be said properly to be the owner of goods belonging either to the Church or to particular churches. Papal administrative authority is exercised principally through the Congregations of the Roman Curia and similar bodies The ordinary is to exercise vigilance over the administration of the property of the diocese, religious institute or other juridical bodies subject to him.Code of Canon Law, canon 1276 What follows is taken from the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia. With the coming into force of the Code of Canon Law in 1917 and its revision in 1983, the provisions of canon law have in some points been changed. What is here needs therefore to be rewritten either by an expert in canon law or by someone who has at his or her disposal the time required to extract the necessary information from canons 1273-1289 of the Code of Canon Law and sources such as this commentary on the Code of Canon Law In each diocese the administration of property belongs primarily to the bishop, subject to the superior authority of the Holy See. From the beginning of the Church, this power has been a part of the episcopal office (can. 37, Can. Apost., Lib. II, cap. xxv, xxvii, xxxv. Const. Apost.). On him all inferior administrators depend, unless they have secured an exemption by law, as in the case of religious orders. Therefore, if an arrangement exists by which the administration of certain diocesan or parish property is entrusted to some members of the clergy or to laymen, the discipline of the Church, nevertheless, maintains the bishop in supreme control with the right to direct and modify, if need be, the action taken by subordinate administrators. Parish level One of the duties of a parish priest is the administration of the moneys and goods belonging to his church. The Third Plenary Council of Baltimore, Tit. IX, Cap. iii, gave detailed regulations concerning the manner in which a rector is to acquit himself of this obligation. Among other things, it is required that he shall keep an accurate record of receipts, expenditures, and debts; that he shall prepare an inventory containing a list of all things belonging to the church, of its income and financial obligations; that one copy of this inventory shall be deposited in the archives of the parish and another in the diocesan archives; that every year necessary changes shall be made in this inventory and signified to the chancellor. The authority of the parish priest is circumscribed by the general authority of the bishop and by special enactments which prevent him from taking any important step without the express written permission of the ordinary. Lay administration In many places laymen are called to a part in the care of church property, sometimes in recognition of particular acts of generosity, more often because their cooperation with the parish priest will be beneficial on account of their experience in temporal matters. Although the origin of the modern fabrica, or board of laymen, is placed by some in the fourteenth and by others in the sixteenth century, the intervention of laymen really goes back to very early times, since we find it referred to in councils of the seventh century. Lay administrators remain completely subject to the bishop in the same manner as the parish priest. The difficulties caused by the pretensions of trustees in the United States during the early part of the nineteenth century evoked from the Holy See a reiteration of the doctrine of the Church regarding diocesan and parish administration notably in a brief of Gregory XVI (12 August 1841) wherein the Pope declared anew that the right of such inferior administrators depends entirely on the authority of the bishop, and that they can do only what the bishop has empowered them to do. In some dioceses where the system of administration by lay trustees is in vogue the regulations and discipline of the Catholic Church are made a part of the bylaws of church corporations, a measure which is of advantage in case of a process before the secular courts. Religious institutes The administration of property belonging to religious institutes under the jurisdiction of the ordinary rests naturally with their superiors, but the bishop may reserve to himself in the constitutions a large right of control and supervision. In reference to institutes under the jurisdiction of the Holy See, the bishop's right is limited to signing the report sent to Rome every third year by the superior. Religious orders are exempt from diocesan control in the administration of their property, but are bound, when engaged in parochial work, to present to the bishop a report of the amounts they have received for parochial purposes, and of the use made of such contributions. Civil authority The exclusive rights of ecclesiastical authorities in the administration of church property have been denied in practice by civil authorities, in the past. Hence the care taken in various councils to admonish administrators to secure the titles to church property in accordance with the provisions of secular law, e.g. III Plen. Balt., no. 266.

Karp grew up first in Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and then, in the later part of her childhood, in Williamsport, Pennsylvania and the surrounding Lycoming County area. She was an educator in philosophy, cultural studies, humanities and arts from a feminist and anti-racist perspective in New York City colleges and universities since 1970. Karp was part of the founding generation of academic feminist educators, producing cutting edge-pedagogy in academic fields that, by the 1990s became categorized, disciplined, and designated as cultural and media studies. Her work stood at the intersection of gender critique and anti- racist activism. Karp's pedagogy and practice sought to further define a rigorous mode of inquiry in feminist and anti-racist studies. Karp envisioned feminism as a movement that can work across disciplinary boundaries and be informed by various traditions of inquiry. Her work was informed by her lifelong study of psychoanalysis. Paintings of Karp's appeared in the November/December 2008 issue of Tikkun magazine and by the Tikkun editor's August 2009 online blog and in the spring 2012 issue of On the Issues Magazine. In 1988, she had a one-person exhibition at the Everhart Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Academic career and art studies After studying painting and liberal arts at Chatham College from 1962 through 1964, Karp transferred to Columbia University, where she earned a B.S. in 1967 in the Philosophy Department. She was an educator in philosophy, cultural studies, humanities and arts from a feminist and anti-racist perspective in New York City colleges and universities from 1970 and continued to teach until nearly the end of her life.Barbara J. Love, Feminists Who Changed America 1963-1975, \\"Barrie Karp\\" brief biography, pp. 244-245. She taught the first feminist philosophy course at Hunter College in 1978; and she filed an unsuccessful discrimination case against City College over her complaints to the affirmative action office about a \\"current and historical lack of female Philosophy Department faculty members at CCNY.\\" She completed a doctorate (1979) in the Philosophy Department at CUNY Graduate Center. Her doctoral dissertation was titled \\"Persons and Self-Deception\\".Saatchi Online Gallery In 1982, she joined the faculty of The New School and the School of Visual Arts (Humanities and Sciences Department, Philosophy and Cultural Studies tracks), and in 1988, the faculty of Eugene Lang College The New School for Liberal Arts at Eugene Lang College. Karp began art studies with Maria Lowenstein (1954 to 1959) and Ian James, 1962. After her Chatham College studies she also studied art at Provincetown Workshop (Leo Manso, Victor Candell, summer 1964) and New York University (Leo Manso, fall 1964, spring 1965). After completing her PhD she studied at the New School for Social Research (Leo Manso, early 1980s); with the Art Students League (Leo Manso, Rudolf Baranik, 1981-1983); and at the Provincetown Art Association Museum School (Selena Trieff, 1983). In the final decade of her life, Karp was making photography, archiving ancestral photos, and writing about family photography, self-portraiture, portraiture and other kinds of photography. Karp's photographs, like her painting, are intimate explorations of the self and relationships. She is said to have loved the Arbus quote: \\"A photo is a secret about a secret.\\" The late musician, filmmaker, and photographer Jon Sholle praised the ‚Äúvision‚Äù and ‚Äúconcept‚Äù of Karp‚Äôs photographs. Artist, musician, and photographer Joe Morris praised Karp‚Äôs great regard for the subjects in her photos, seeing ‚Äúbeauty in things that are ignored by most people.‚Äù Activism on Karp's behalf In Spring 2008, Lang College The New School for Liberal Arts students conducted peaceful protests, including a conversation with faculty at a Lang College faculty meeting and at other meetings with faculty, administrators, and students; and demonstrating in the college's courtyard and student publications in the Lang College The New School for Liberal Arts paper, ‚ÄúNew School Free Press‚Äù, sometimes also known as IMPRINT. Students created a public support group on Facebook that they titled Lang Needs Barrie!!! where they put their writings and other materials related to the case. This public support group still existed as of 2019. In an article by Kevin Dugan in the April 1, 2008 issue of the New School Free Press', a Lang senior, Jamila Thompson, was quoted as saying, \\"If it can happen to Barrie, it can happen to anybody....our voices are not valued.\\" According to then-Lang student Anna Bean, in an opinion piece published in the April 15, 2008, New School Free Press, stated that 120 students, faculty, and alumni of Lang have signed the petition urging the administration to reconsider the decision\\" to not renew Karp's contract. In an April 29, 2008 letter to the editor in the New School Free Press, Lang alumna Michelle Salerno described Karp as \\"the finest professor I ever had\\" and lauded Karp's \\"breadth of knowledge on feminism, critical race studies, philosophy and the arts\\".

Radella Cricket Grounds is one of the few Cricket grounds situated 4,000 ft above sea level. Its setting is described as one of the most picturesque cricket grounds of the world. History Radella Cricket Grounds is home to the Dimbula Athletic & Cricket Club, which was founded in 1856. The first recorded match played in 18‚Äì19 November 1892, between touring Lord Hawke's XI and Up-country XI. Another notable match the grounds played host to was the tour match of MCC captained by future England cricket captain Mike Smith against Up-country XI in 1962. Recent times Probably the ground's most noted game is New Zealand's tour match against the President's XI in 1983/84 tour. Unfortunately the game was washed out due to rain. But Sir Richard Hadlee said that Sri Lanka is a good place for Swing Bowling owing to higher altitude and cloudy sky. Since then little cricket has been played here. Four Youth Cricket World Cup matches were played here including the match between Pakistan under-19s versus Kenya under-19s.

It is a cardboard-themed side-scrolling platform game with the ability to turn the camera around 180 degrees to view the 2d cardboard world from the opposite side. Flipside was developed by Danish studio Team 3, a group of students from DADIU and released June 18, 2007. Storyline Flipside is a third-person total conversion of Valve's Half-Life 2. The player takes on the identity of a mental patient with extreme mood changes who is planning his escape from an insane asylum. The imaginary escape through the landscape surrounding the insane asylum takes place in a world put together from cardboard pieces and jumping jacks decorated with magazine cuttings, stickers, and drawings. Reflecting the extreme mood changes of the character, the player can at any point turn the camera around 180 degrees to see the world from the opposite side. One side is a happy, fluffy world with rainbows, bunnies, and bumble bees, while the other side is a gloomy, hostile world with thunderclouds, evil nurses, and killer wasps. Critical reaction Flipside was an Independent Games Festival 2008 FinalistThe 10th Annual Independent Games Festival and received Mod DB's 2007 Editor's Choice award. Mod DB gave the game a rating of 8.0, praising its original concept and graphics style while criticizing its sometimes frustrating controls and lackluster AI. Similarly, a review in PC Zone found the original premise and style in the game good enough to forgive the difficulty and rough keyboard controls. A review in Games for Windows: The Official Magazine calls the fun short-lived, but notes that it is worth it to see the art in motion and the dramatic camera effect when switching side.

The current version is a light, versatile, eight-shot, double-action revolver chambered for the .22 Long Rifle cartridge, manufactured by Smith & Wesson. Due to its low weight, it can be carried for hiking or camping and used for recreational shooting, while still providing an emergency back-up in case of danger. Due to this light weight and small size, the Model 317 is quite easily concealed. With this in mind, an area of the butt of the gun is hollowed out. A transverse pin allows the use of a lanyard to carry the Model 317 under clothing. History The 317 was designed to be lighter than previous Smith & Wesson 'kit' guns carried for outdoor activities. Steel was replaced by titanium and aluminum for this purpose. Between World War I and World War II, the kit bags carried by hunters, hikers, campers, and fisherman frequently had a small handgun inside. These kit bags carried many of the necessary items one might need when alone in the open country or forest. In 1935, the .357 Magnum was released by Smith & Wesson. It was said to be ‚ÄúThe World‚Äôs Most Powerful Revolver.‚Äù After this came the more compact .22/.32 Target I-frame revolvers. The .22/.32 Kit Gun was so named because it was intended to be carried in a kit bag. The Kit Gun line began as an I-Frame, .22 caliber 6-shot revolver in 1953, and its model designation at the time was 'Model of 1953'. This is sometimes called the 'pre-34'. In 1958, S&W; renamed it as the Model 34 and began stamping the models thus. This production continued till the early 1960s, when the pistol was redesigned using the larger J-frame J-frame and marketed as the model 34-1. Due to the growing popularity of stainless steel revolvers, the .22/.32 Model 63 Kit Gun was released in 1977 (with the same design as the 34-1), the .22 WMR Model 651 in 1983, and the .32 Magnum Kit Gun in 1990. There was a Kit Gun Airweight (Model 43) and a Kit Gun chambered in .22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire (.22 WMR, the Model 51), the Target version with 6\\" barrel (Model 35), as well as the standard Kit Gun. All three were available with adjustable sights. The Model 34 continued to be manufactured until 1991, but Model 43 and 51 production stopped in 1974. The model 63 stainless was replaced by the significantly lighter model 317 in the late 2000s. Older Kit Guns have been replaced, and though some come in larger calibers, they are even lighter. This is due to advances in titanium and aluminum construction. There is the Model 317 .22 Long Rifle (.22LR) AirLite Kit Gun, the Model 337 .38 Special AirLite Kit Gun, and a .44 Special Kit Gun, the Model 396 AirLite Mountain Lite Kit Gun. These revolvers have aluminum alloy frames and cylinders made of titanium (except the Model 317, whose cylinder is aluminum). While titanium is considerably lighter than steel, it is just as strong. The aluminum barrels have a steel liner. Snub barrel variation The Smith & Wesson Model 317 is the lighter, shorter version of the Model 317 Kit Gun. It is extremely light at just 10.8 oz / 306.2 g (unloaded). The model 63 stainless also comes in an 8-shot, 3-inch-barrel version.

Background Philip, at enmity with Boniface, had aggressively expanded what he saw as royal rights by conferring benefices and appointing bishops to sees, regardless of papal authority. He drove from their sees bishops who were in opposition to his will and supported the Pope. In 1295, Boniface created a see at Pamiers from the diocese of Toulouse by the bull Romanus Pontifex, made it a suffragan of the archdiocese of Narbonne and named Bernard Saisset as bishop. However, the opposition of Hughes Mascaron, Bishop of Toulouse, and the conflict between Saisset and Roger Bernard III, Count of Foix, prevented Saisset from taking immediate possession of his diocese. As an ardent Occitan aristocrat, Saisset made no secret of the fact that he despised the northern \\"Frankish\\" French. In 1299, Boniface suspended two bishops in the south of France. Philip then attempted to exercise the droit de regale and claimed the right to seize the revenues of the vacant sees. Boniface objected that suspension is not the same as deposition and did not render a see vacant. He sent the Bishop of Pamiers to Philip as legate to protest.Robertson, James Craigie.

The letter is couched in firm, paternal terms. It points out the evils the king has brought to his kingdom, to church and to State and invites him to do penance and mend his ways. Aftermath It went unheeded by Philip and was followed by the papal bull Unam Sanctam.

This problem happens due to internal data corruption (caused by the phone), and can only be fixed by restoring the phone to its original software/firmware ‚Äî meaning that all personal data will be erased. On some occasions, this problem can be fixed by using the Update Service software that comes on the CD (or from Sony Ericsson's website). However, personal data will still be erased. Users are recommended to regularly backup their data using both a Memory Stick ‚Äî for photos and contacts ‚Äî and using the software MyPhoneExplorer to back up other data to a PC. A startup failure can be predicted when the text message menu can no longer be opened. A hardware fault that has been reported frequently is that the earpiece speaker on the slider-screen will quit working due to a fragile connector. This can sometimes be temporarily 'fixed' by depressing and holding the 'c' button on the right side; or by using the speakerphone option.

He was previously the general secretary of the Communist Party of Pakistan. Saqi was imprisoned for more than 15 years due to his political activities. During his period in jail his then wife, Sukhan, had committed suicide after reading a news paper containing allegations of Jam Saqi's death. He then left the Communist Party in 1991 and joined the Pakistan Peoples Party and the Trotskyist The Struggle group. He is married to Akhtar Sultana. Biography Born in village Janjhi, Taluka Chhachhro, district Tharparkar, In the home of Muhmmad Sachal who was an educationalist and a well known social worker at Thar. Saqi passed his matriculation examinations from Local Board High School, Chachro in 1962. Later, he studied at Government College, Sachal Sarmast Arts College Hyderabad, and Sindh University, Jamshoro from where he did his Masters. In an interview Jam Saqi recounted later that a retired primary teacher Inayatullah Dhamchar put him in touch with the underground Communist Party of Pakistan. Saqi, a fiery student leader of yesteryears, was arrested after the incident of 4 March 1967, later he founded Sindh National Students Federation (SNSF) ‚Äì a student wing of Communist Party on November 3, 1968, of which he was the founder president with Nadeem Akhter as the founding vice president and Mir Thebo as general secretary of the organization. Saqi worked with Comrade Haider Bux Jatoi, G.M Syed, Qazi Faiz Muhammad, Ghulam Muhammad Laghari many other nationalist and peasants worker of Sindh. In 1969, he joined Sindh Hari Committee (Sindh Peasants organisation) at Sakrand Hari conference. Small wonder, then, that Pakistan People's Party emerged victorious in Sindh and Punjab, Awami League in East Pakistan and National Awami Party in North West Frontier Province (NWFP) and Balochistan. All of them had socialist leaning,\\" Saqi told The News. He had to serve sentence awarded by military court in early 70s. Later he joined Natioanl Awami Party and was elected joint secretary of the party. However, he regretted that while Bhutto and Maulana Bhashani openly espoused socialism, the communist cadre was taught to refrain themselves to the slogan of national democratic revolution. In 1971 when a military operation was initiated in East Pakistan, his organization brought out rallies against the military junta in Hyderabad and Nawabshah. During this period he went underground and organised peasants and youth of Sindh. In 1983, he along with Prof. Jamal Naqvi, Sohail Sangi, Badar Abro, Kamal Warsi and Shabir Shar was tried in a special military court for allegedly acting against the ideology of Pakistan. Stalwarts, such as Pakistan Peoples Party leader Benazir Bhutto Baloch leader Mir Ghous Bux Bizenjo, Khan Abdul Wali Khan, Begum Tahira Mazhar Ali Khan, Mairaj Mohammad Khan, Fatehyab Ali Khan, Maulana Shah Mohammed Amroti, some renowned journalists Manhaj Burna, Shaikh ALi Mohammad, Shaikh Aziz, Iqbal Jafri, students leaders Hasil Bezinjo, and so on, were his defence witnesses. This case is also known as Communist case or Jam Saqi Case. Jam Saqi supported the anti Zia MRD movement launched by the alliance of political parties. Jam Saqi is also an author. He wrote a novelet \\"Khahori Khijan\\", a book about students movement in Sindh \\"Sindh Ji Shagrid Tahreek\\", while his court statements in the special military courts were published in book format (in both Urdu and Sindhi languages) with the names \\"Tareekh Moonkhay na wesarreendi\\" and \\"Zameer ke Qaidi\\". In 2009 he was given a lifetime achievement award for his outstanding services rendered for betterment of working class conditions and human rights. Death On 5 March 2018, Saqi died at the age of 73, due to kidney failure in Hyderabad, Sindh. In the evening, after the namaz-e-janaza he was laid to rest at the Baban Shah graveyard in Hyderabad.

In 1976 he began a residency in pathology at Stanford University in California, and was awarded a professorship in the Department of Pathology there. He is also staff physician and director of the Serology and Immunology Section at the Veterans Administration, Palo Alto Health Care System. Research focus Butcher and his research team study the trafficking of white blood cells (lymphocytes, dendritic cells, monocytes, etc.), including their interactions with the endothelial lining of blood vessels at sites of leukocyte extravasation, and their chemotactic responses in tissues. These events regulate immune responses by controlling the access of leukocytes to sites of inflammatory or immune reaction in the body. He and his research team have shown that lymphocytes use a variety of different adhesion molecules or \\"homing receptors\\" to recognize organ (and/or inflammation)-specific vascular ligands or \\"addressins\\" that define the tissue position (address) of blood vessels in the body. Their studies have shown that these adhesion receptors act coordinately with G protein-linked serpentine chemoattractant receptors in a multi-step process that controls the specificity and provides combinatorial diversity in leukocyte trafficking. A major focus of the group is on understanding the physiologic significance and control of targeted lymphocyte trafficking. To this end, they are studying the specialized homing mechanisms and functional properties of tissue infiltrating lymphocytes involved in local immune, autoimmune and regulatory responses in the GI tract (intestines, liver), skin, lungs, and other sites. Genetic, antibody and small molecule-based approaches allow them to define the role of trafficking molecules and mechanisms in models of autoimmune and infectious diseases. The team is also exploring mechanisms that imprint lymphocyte homing and chemokine receptor expression during tissue-specific immune responses, and are developing techniques to recapitulate such regulation in vitro for cell targeting and therapy. Dendritic cells (DC) play an important role in this context, and they are interested in the mechanisms by which specialized DC ‚Äúinterpret‚Äù and process local environmental signals (e.g. vitamins, metabolites, cytokines) to control T cell trafficking and regulatory vs. effector activities.Faculty & Researcher Profiles - Stanford University Medical Center In other investigations, the team has identified novel lymphocyte, dendritic cell and macrophage chemoattractants and receptors, as well as monocyte and arterial wall endothelial molecules that regulate monocyte-endothelial interactions in models of atherogenesis. They are interested in the structure and function of these molecules, and their importance in disease models. Finally, they have shown that leukocytes can effectively navigate through complex chemoattractant arrays, and they are exploring the mechanisms that permit this surprising behavior through computer simulations of chemotactic behavior, and through experimental manipulation of the molecules and receptors involved.

Description Gladsmuir's principal \\"claim to fame\\" relates to its role as the site of the Battle of Prestonpans (1745). Some sources - particularly maps - occasionally refer to the confrontation as the Battle of Gladsmuir. The Jacobite poet William Hamilton (1704-1754) wrote a poem entitled Ode on the Battle of Gladsmuir, 1745 in celebration of the battle. The philanthropist George Heriot, jeweller to James VI, King of Scots and founder of Heriot's Hospital, (later George Heriot's School), in Edinburgh, may have been born in Gladsmuir, his father was. Church Old Gladsmuir Parish Kirk dates from some time between 1650 and the creation of the parish in 1695 and its ruins stand to the north of the current operational church. The replacement church is a Romanesque cruciform church dating from 1839 and designed by William Burn. The interior was destroyed by a fire in 1886 and restored by architect John Farquharson of Haddington with later improvements made in 1929. The older ruined kirk can still be seen and explored behind the new kirk. The graveyard contains interesting 18th century monuments and several CWGC graves from both world wars. The manse dates from 1871 and stands to the north-east. History Gladsmuir parish was created in 1692 and in its original form it reached the southern shores of the Firth of Forth and extended to an area of 10 square miles. As well as the modern village of Gladsmuir the villages of Longniddry, Macmerry, Elvingston and Samuelston were within the newly created parish. The name Gladsmuir was originally ‚ÄòGledsmuir‚Äô and this name means ‚Äòthe moor of the kite or hawk‚Äô, gled being the Scots word for either a red kite or a common buzzard. There were limestone and coal deposits within the parish, as well a rich deposits of clay and iron and in the 19th Century this was an industrial parish. Weaving dominated in Longniddry and Samuelston while there were iron works at Macmerry and limeworkings at Harlow. Distinctively white bricks and roof tiles were produced locally, while the coal mines employed 50 miners, in addition to 30 women and 36 boys in 1836. In the mid 20th century mining had mostly disappeared from the area, however, open-cast coal extraction continued at Blindwells up to the 1970s. The Great North Road between Edinburgh and London once passed through the parish, as does the railway lines to North Berwick and the south. In the 20th Century Longniddry and Macmerry expanded and overtook Gladsmuir village in size and importance. Butterdean wood Butterdean Wood is a mixed woodland of cobifers and broad-leafed trees to the north of Gladsmuir which is owned by the Woodland Trust. It has a car park and two way- marked trails and contains a number of wildlife themed sculptures.

History  The firm was founded by brothers Cyril and Leonard Blausten as surveyors in 1934 at the Angel in north London. Then with one month‚Äôs free rent courtesy of their father and an Olympia typewriter as working capital the business began and has flourished ever since. Within ten years they opened a second office at 52 Brook Street in the West End during the Second World War, giving the two brothers an opportunity to begin their careers in development. It was in these early post-war years that Cyril Blausten formed strong friendships with other big name son the London property scene: Harold Samuel, Maxwell Joseph, Max Rayne, Jack Salmon and Jack Cotton.Cyril Blausten - Obituary in the Times In a period between 1959 and 1961 over 25 property companies came to the London Stock Market. For the Blausten brothers their first public vehicle was Simo Securities Trust, formerly an Indonesian Rubber Company shell. From then on a string of development projects in London, Guildford, Manchester and other booming areas were completed as the company became part of the drive to regenerate Britain. By 1970 Simo had grown to include, by acquisition, a merchant bank and a Lloyds Underwriting Agency. Just as Simo was turning into a property based financial conglomerate the company succumbed to a hostile takeover bid from Town and Commercial Properties. The physical devastation in post-war Britain‚Äôs major cities had presented a serious financial problem for the governments of Churchill and Attlee. However the period was a ripe opportunity for young entrepreneurs to take the lead, and so they did in an unprecedented way in Europe. Many, either refugees or sons of refugees, found freedom and sanctuary from persecution in the UK and began a development spree that lasted through to 1974 as the country was rebuilt. In addition to commercial and corporate activity Cyril Blausten formed a strong relationship with George Wimpey and through Winglaw Properties together developed and regenerated of land on the Ilchester Estate in Abbotsbury Road and St Mary Abbots Terrace on Kensington High Street. Cyril Blausten himself found time to devote to the Jewish Board of Guardians, now Jewish Care, becoming Hon Secretary, Vice Chairman and Vice President. As Chairman of the Property Committee he helped oversee one of the largest residential care home development programmes after the war.Ham and High 25 January 2007 From the mid 1970s Cyril concentrated on his private property investment companies, his financial investments and Cyril Leonard from which he retired as Senior Partner in 1996, remaining as a Consultant until 2000. Cyril Blausten died in December 2006. Douglas and Simon, two of his four sons are still senior partners within the firm.

Before it was decommissioned in March 2018, it operated the AgustaWestland Merlin HM2 helicopter. History1940‚Äì1942= 829 Naval Air Squadron first formed on 15 June 1940 as a torpedo and reconnaissance squadron at Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) Ford, Sussex, UK, and equipped with nine Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers. In October, it began nightly bombing attacks from RNAS St. Eval, Cornwall, on German shipping and docks at Brest, France. During these attacks, the commanding officer of 829 NAS L/C OS Stevinson and crew was lost on 9 October 1940. In the next month, the squadron was assigned to the aircraft carrier , which then sailed to escort the convoy WS-5A to West Africa and Cape Town. Part of the convoy came into contact with the German heavy cruiser , but the aircraft of 829 NAS failed to sight her. Leaving Cape Town in January 1941, HMS Formidable sailed for the Red Sea, where her aircraft carried out attacks on the Italian-held cities of Mogadishu and Massawa in February. After a passage through the Suez Canal, the squadron had to be partially re-equipped with Fairey Swordfish due to losses. During the Battle of Matapan, late in March, one of the squadron's Albacores scored a hit on the Italian battleship , where the squadron CO Lt. Cdr. John Dalyell-Stead was shot down and killed. Further activities in the Mediterranean involved an attack on an Italian airfield on Karpathos, the second largest of the Greek Dodecanese islands, at the end of May, after which the aircraft operated from Lod for some time, attacking Vichy French shipping during the Syria-Lebanon campaign. However, on 26 May 1941, HMS Formidable received serious damage while transporting aircraft to Malta, being hit by two German bombs that put her out of action for six months. 829 NAS was stationed in June on Cyprus where all Albacores were left when the carrier sailed for repairs at Norfolk Naval Shipyard (U.S.) in July 1941. Six of the squadron's Swordfish provided anti-submarine patrols whilst the carrier was en route for repairs in the U.S., by way of Cape Town. After being put ashore in Jamaica, 829 NAS joined for passage to Norfolk, Virginia (U.S.), before rejoining the repaired HMS Formidable to return to Great Britain. There the squadron received 12 new ASV- equipped Swordfish Mk.II, with which it rejoined HMS Illustrious in March 1942. Sailing by way of Cape Town, 829 NAS took part in an attack on Diego Suarez during the invasion of Madagascar In May. Successful attacks were carried out on the Vichy French submarines Bƒóvƒóziers and Le Hƒóros, and also a sloop and an escort ship, for the loss of five aircraft. Airborne support was provided in September for attacks on the remaining Vichy troops in south Madagascar. Following this, HMS Illustrious sailed to Durban for a refit, and whilst there 829 NAS was amalgamated with 810 Naval Air Squadron at Stamford Hill airfield (near Durban) on 7 October 1942. =1943‚Äì1944= On 1 October 1943, 829 NAS was reformed as a torpedo bomber reconnaissance squadron at RNAS Lee-on-the-Solent, flying twelve Fairey Barracuda MK.II as part of the 52nd Naval TBR Wing. These embarked in in March 1944, and on 3 April took part in Operation Tungsten, a successful attack on the German battleship in the K√•fjord, Norway for the loss of two aircraft. After an abortive attempt to carry out a similar attack in May, attacks were made on shipping off Norway, but on 9 July 1944 829 NAS was amalgamated with 831 Naval Air Squadron on HMS Victorious and ceased to exist. =1964‚Äì1994= 829 was reformed at RNAS Culdrose, Cornwall (UK), on 4 March 1964. The squadron was formed from a nucleus of No. 700W Flight, which was the training unit for Westland Wasp helicopter crews. Its task was to provide helicopter detachments to operate from small ships and survey vessels, the Wasp HAS1 performing in the role of a medium-range anti-submarine torpedo-carrying helicopter. The first four such flights were allocated to the frigates , , , and . Wasp HAS1 in markings of 829 NAS, HQ Flt at RNAS Yeovilton, 2005. The squadron also took over the responsibility for the Westland Wessex HAS1 helicopters operating from s. In 1969, the HAS1 was replaced by the Wessex HAS3. In December 1964, 829 NAS handed over the task of Wasp conversion to 706 Naval Air Squadron, and was relocated to RNAS Portland, Dorset. Until the Wasp was retired in 1988, the squadron remained responsible for all Wasp-equipped Ship's Flights. This led to several Wasps from the squadron, re-painted as a fictional HMS Hero Flight, being used in the popular 1970s BBC television drama series Warship. When 771 Naval Air Squadron was disbanded in January 1965, 829 NAS also received Westland Whirlwind helicopters returning them when 771 NAS reformed in June 1967. In 1966, 829 NAS also received two Wessex HU5s for operation from the Royal Fleet Auxiliaries and . Responsibility for the ice patrol ship was also taken over in 1966, initially using Whirlwind HAR1s. These were soon replaced by Whirlwind HAR9s, which transferred to in 1968, and were eventually replaced by Wasp helicopters in 1976. In June 1970, responsibility for small ships' Wessex helicopters was transferred to 737 Naval Air Squadron at RNAS Portland. A further restructuring took place in January 1972 when 703 Naval Air Squadron was established at RNAS Portland to take over the Wasp conversion and operational flying training role. This task was reassigned to 829 NAS in January 1981. In August 1982, the operation of Wessex HAS3 anti-submarine detachments was returned to 737 NAS. Falklands War Eleven Westland Wasp HAS1 helicopters of 829 NAS participated in the Falklands War in 1982. They were embarked in the Type 21 frigate , the es and , the ice patrol ship HMS Endurance, MV Contender Bezant and the survey ships , , and . On 25 April 1982, the Argentinian submarine Santa Fe was spotted by a Wessex HAS3 from . The Wessex then attacked it with depth charges. launched a Wasp HAS1 helicopter, and launched a Westland Lynx HAS2. The Lynx attacked the submarine with a MK 46 torpedo, and also strafed it with its pintle-mounted GPMG; the Wessex also fired on Santa Fe with its GPMG. The Wasp from HMS Plymouth as well as two other Wasps launched from Endurance fired AS.12 anti-ship missiles at the submarine, scoring hits. Santa Fe was damaged badly enough to prevent her from submerging. The crew abandoned the submarine at the jetty at King Edward Point on South Georgia and surrendered to the British forces, thus becoming the first casualty of the sea war, as well as the first direct engagement by the Royal Navy Task Force. The last Wasp was finally withdrawn from service in 1988 when the last of the Type 12 Rothesay-class frigates was decommissioned. Starting in September 1986 829 NAS had already received a number of Westland Lynx HAS2 detachments transferred from 815 Naval Air Squadron. In 1988 the squadron eventually had up to 30 Lynx. Flights were regularly deployed on the Armilla patrol in the Persian Gulf. The squadron was awarded the \\"Boyd Trophy\\" jointly with 815 NAS for their service in the Persian Gulf. Persian Gulf War Between August 1990 and February 1991, several flights of 829 NAS participated in the Persian Gulf War. Six Lynx helicopters armed with Sea Skua missiles were sent from 829 NAS to the Gulf on four Royal Navy frigates. The first success came when Lynx 335 from ‚Äîtogether with an American Seahawk‚Äîcame across and destroyed a minesweeper or landing vessel. Lynx 335‚Äîalong with 's Lynx and U.S. forces‚Äîsubsequently also destroyed two Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery batteries mounted on offshore oil rigs off Kuwait.Lawrence p.637 On 24 January 1991, Lynx 335 attacked three Iraqi vessels off the island of Quarah, sinking two minesweepers. Lynx 335 also attempted to capture a minelayer, but she was scuttled by her Iraqi crew. Quarah was later captured by coalition forces, becoming the first Iraqi territory to be liberated. On 29 January, Royal Navy helicopters spotted a flotilla of 17 Iraqi landing craft, part of an attempted amphibious assault in support of the Iraqi forces engaged in the Battle of Khafji. Lynxes from , Gloucester and Cardiff sank two, while the rest were either damaged, sunk or dispersed by U.S. carrier-borne aircraft and Royal Navy Westland Sea King helicopters. On 30 January, a convoy consisting of three Polnochny-class landing ships, three TNC-45 fast-attack craft and a single Type 43 minelayer was attacked. HMS Gloucesters Lynx destroyed a TNC-45, while Cardiff and Brazens Lynxes attacked the Type 43. Other units were also damaged, including a Polnochny that was later destroyed by RAF SEPECAT Jaguars.Lawrence p.638 On 8 February, Lynx 335 attacked a Zhuk-class patrol boat, and on 11 February, the same helicopter sank another Zhuk. In total, Lynx helicopters from 829 NAS were responsible for 15 Iraqi ships sunk in the war, at least five of which were sunk by a single helicopter, Lynx 335. The Squadron was disbanded on 26 March 1993, when all its Lynx Flights were absorbed by 815 NAS. A Merlin HM1 from HMS Monmouth flight, 829 NAS, 2007. =2004‚Äì2013= The squadron was recommissioned on 21 October 2004 at RNAS Culdrose, Cornwall with the Merlin HM.1. 829 NAS originally provided three detachments (\\"flights\\") for the following Type 23 frigates: , and . With , , and due to join during 2005 and 2006. The following ships were allocated flights from 829 NAS as well: , , and . The remaining four Type 23 frigates operate Westland Lynx HMA.8s of 815 Naval Air Squadron. As of 2012 829 NAS has five ship's flights in support of six Type 23 frigates. =2013 to present= The squadron took on Merlin HM.2 and operated from mainly Type 23 frigates. * 01 Flight: Aboard between November 2015 and present day * 03 Flight: Aboard during October 2015. * 04 Flight: Aboard during November 2014. 04 Flight became 02 Flight in May 2016.

The LD&ECR; wished to extend into Sheffield using the MS&LR;'s lines but was rebuffed, and instead joined the Midland's line at Beighton Junction. From there it went on to join the Sheffield District Railway at Treeton Junction and thereby gain access to goods traffic in central Sheffield and to the Midland Railway's station. =Closure= The station closed in 1930. The line itself closed to stopping passenger services on the outbreak of World War II in 1939. In the late 1980s the station site was home to a short-lived railway preservation attempt known as the Rother Valley Railway. This was formally abandoned in 1992, the preservationists' energy and commitment was transferred to the Cleethorpes Coast Light Railway. = Today = The station fell into disuse after closure and the track on the line was completely lifted in the 1980s when the nearby Westthorpe Colliery closed. The Station Master's house on Field Lane is now a private dwelling and has no connection to the old platforms, which themselves have been demolished along with any other traces of the station.

Background The feud involved the Tutt family, supporters of the Whig Party, and the Everett family, adherents of the Democratic Party. The Everetts had moved to Arkansas from Kentucky, with John \\"Sim\\", Jesse and Bart Everett becoming some of the most influential men in the area. The Tutt family, from Tennessee, was led by Hansford \\"Hamp\\" Tutt. They were influential in Searcy County, Arkansas, and were bitterly opposed to dividing Marion and Searcy counties. A third family, the Kings, also became involved, supporting the Tutts as Whig Party backers. Violence first occurred during a political debate in Yellville, Arkansas, which degenerated into an all out brawl. The fighting peaked when Tutt supporter Alfred Burnes struck John Everett on the head with the blade of a hoe. Many fled, thinking Everett had been killed. However, he survived, despite receiving a severe gash in his head. Over the following four years, heated arguments between the factions would often lead to fist fights and brawls. Violence increases, 1848‚Äì50 On October 9, 1848, the first gunfight took place. It happened in downtown Yellville and left John Everett dead. Two days later, the Everetts retaliated, shooting dead \\"Old\\" William King and his son Lumis. Billy King (William's son) and a friend called \\"Cherokee Bob\\", escaped with non-fatal wounds. Thereafter the rival factions engaged in gunfights almost every month, sometimes resulting in injuries but with no recorded deaths. That year, Ewell Everett was elected judge, and Tutt supporter George Adams became constable, which heightened tensions. Jesse Everett and Everett supporter Jacob Stratton and moved to Texas by the end of the year. On July 4, 1849, Marion County Sheriff Jesse Mooney, who had a gained a tough reputation by killing or capturing several local outlaws, organized a posse to stop the feud. The same day, the biggest gunfight of the feud took place. The Everetts had gathered in Yellville in a building across the street from the saloon where the Tutt faction was known to be meeting. Sheriff Mooney interceded and attempted to prevent violence. However, both sides ignored him and a gunfight broke out, with Sheriff Mooney and his posse caught in middle. The gunfight continued for hours. When their ammunition was finally exhausted, the Tutt and Everett men rushed into the street and continued the fight hand to hand with knives and clubs. When it was over, Jack King, Bart Everett, Davis Tutt, Ben Tutt, and Lunsford Tutt all lay dead. John \\"Uncle Jacky\\" Hurst had been shot in the leg while jumping in front of Sheriff Mooney when Tutt supporter S.W. Ferrall fired at him. Others had been wounded. Dave Sinclair, the man suspected of killing John Everett, fled from Yellville. The Everett faction members trailed him and killed him the next day. Jesse Everett, learning of his brother Bart's death, returned to Arkansas for revenge. Sheriff Mooney sent his son to Little Rock with an appeal for help from Governor Thomas Drew. Thomas Mooney saw the governor, but he disappeared on his return trip home. Although his horse was found, his body was never recovered, nor were killers ever identified. Governor Drew ordered the militia to organize in neighboring Carroll County, Arkansas. The militiamen relieved Sheriff Mooney and took control of Yellville. Mooney has often been criticized for not stopping the violence, but there is little he could have done by himself. It was even hard to find deputies, since so many men in the county were aligned with one or the other of the factions. The Carroll County militia arrested several members of the Everett faction, but when the militiamen went home six weeks later, the Everetts broke into the jail and freed their friends. Hansford \\"Hamp\\" Tutt was shot and murdered along the banks of Crooked Creek by a mysterious stranger named the \\"Dutchman\\" from Texas who was hired by Everett. Afterwards, \\"The Dutchman\\" was never seen or heard from again. Everett and another follower fled to Shreveport, La. Everett died soon after in a cholera epidemic. Tutt and Everett now dead, effectively ended the feud. Except for the Flynn‚ÄìDoran Feud of the 1880s, in Hot Springs, Arkansas, which preceded the Hot Springs Gunfight of 1899, this is the best known feud in Arkansas. Davis Tutt, who was a child at the time and whose father played a major part in the feud, moved west following his service in the Confederate Army. He was killed by Wild Bill Hickok on July 21, 1865 in one of the more famous Old West gunfights.

Pierre Lacau (25 November 1873 - 26 March 1963) was a French Egyptologist and philologist. He served as Egypt's director of antiquities from 1914 until 1936, and oversaw the 1922 discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun in the Valley of the Kings by Howard Carter. Early life Pierre Lacau was born in the French commune of Brie-Comte-Robert.Wikipedia - French edition He was raised and educated as a Jesuit.Pharaoh Season In Egypt: Monumental Unravelings Career Lacau's first appointment in Cairo was to the International Commission for drafting the general catalogue of the Museum of Cairo. In 1912 he was appointed director of the French Institute of Eastern Archaeology, succeeding √âmile Chassinat, whose work he continued by excavating new structures within Abu Rawash, the funerary complex of Djedefre to the east of the pyramids of Giza. From 1914 to 1936 he served as director general of the Department of Antiquities of Egypt. He was appointed in 1914 to succeed Gaston Maspero but could not take up the position until after World War I. He immediately announced that excavation concessions would be limited to representatives of public institutions and societies. He then reinterpreted the law covering division of finds so that the Egyptian National Museum could take all unique finds and give the excavator all the rest.Giza Pyramids.org - The Dead Hand (PDF) Lacau oversaw the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922 by the English archaeologists Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon in the Valley of the Kings. Relations with Carter were rarely cordial and were exacerbated by both the monopoly of publication rights which Lord Carnarvon sold to The Times, and pressure from the Egyptian government who resented the lack of Egyptian involvement in the Tutankhamen excavation.Politics and the King Tut Discovery by Jimmy Dunn In 1924 Lacau, acting under the orders of the new Minister of Public Works, forbade the wives of Howard Carter's team to enter the tomb. Carter closed the tomb in protest, locked it, refused to hand over the keys, and posted an explanatory notice in the Old Winter Palace Hotel, Luxor, thus breaking the terms of his license and relinquishing full control to Lacau.Ancient Egypt - The History, People and Culture of the Nile Valley, Audrey Carter gives insight into the life of Howard Carter for Ancient Egypt magazine In 1938 Lacau was appointed professor at the Coll√®ge de France in Paris, where he held the chair in Egyptology until 1947; he was elected to the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres in 1939.

It covers an area of 7,570 km2.Operation Loango The WWF recognized it as an area needing protection as early as 1989 and has been actively working towards protecting the forest since 1997. The park was established as a provisional reserve in 2000 but the Mink√©b√© National Park itself was officially recognized and established by the Gabonese government in August 2002. It is recognized as a critical site for conservation by the IUCN and has been proposed as a World Heritage Site. History and management The Fang people once inhabited the Mink√©b√© area but on becoming a protected area the park now has no permanent human population. The name Mink√©b√© derives from the Fang word minkegbe, which means 'valleys' or 'ditches'. Historically, the park was under former French army control in the 1920s. In 1997, the WWF initiated a management program and established two main centres of forest command, one at Oyem, the other at Makokou. A central camp was also installed at the mouth of the river Nouna to manage the protected area.Gabon National Parks, Retrieved on June 18, 2008 The Congo forest basin under the TRIDOM interzone of protection. Mink√©b√© National Park is shown in the west Since 1997, the park has received funds from DGIS (Netherlands Development Cooperation) and CARPE (USAID), and the WWF has worked with other groups to build up ways in which to manage and protect the biodiversity in the park. The park has received donors from the European Union, CARPE, UNESCO and the French Global Environment Facility (FFEM). The WWF has attempted to create a complex of protected areas in the interzone between Gabon, Republic of the Congo and Cameroon and the Minkebe was intended to become a part of a conservation process on a much broader geographical scale. This interzone is considered one of the most biologically rich forests in Africa and is ecologically a part of the Northwest Congolian Lowland Forest ecoregion, one of WWF's main global ecoregions. This work at a regional level in the interzone between Cameroon, Republic of the Congo and Gabon is known as the Dja- Odzala-Mink√©b√© Tri-National (TRIDOM), where each of the countries have committed themselves to cooperating, implementing and managing the interzone in order to promote conservation and sustainable development. The TRIDOM zone covers 140,000 km2 which equates to approximately 7.5% of the Congo Basin's forests. Although much of the protected area is unspoiled with human intervention, logging of Gabonese redwood trees has increased considerably in recent years where roads have been built and there are two logging concessions in the area which could threaten the park in the future. Other threats to the park include low scale gold mining and hunting for crocodile skin, ivory or meat to sell in the cities of Gabon although this is relatively low. Hunting management is being implemented by a protocol signed within Gabon, between the Gabonese Ministry of Forestry Economy, the Governorate of the Woleu-Ntem Province, Bordamur and the villages in which are directly involved. The protocol acknowledges the interests of conservationists, loggers and local communities on matters relating to hunting and fishing. There is also a management strategy towards hunting activities in the north-eastern periphery of the park between the Ministry of Forestry Economy, the Ministry of Mines, and local representatives. In 2007, it was reported that a Chinese company had filed to exploit the second-largest iron ore deposit in the world, near the Minkebe National Park. To clear for the mining, it would involve removing a large area of the surrounding forest, and an estimated of railway, up to 40,000 Chinese laborers, and a hydroelectric dam would be needed to make it possible. This could seriously threaten the future of the conservation area, and the WWF are working with the Chinese and other mining companies in Gabon to attempt to provide a solution. Geography The Minkebe forest itself covers 30,000 km2 in the wider area. There exists a wide diversity of habitats, from inselberg forest, herbaceous swamps, inundated river forest to secondary forest. The landscape of the park is dominated by isolated rock domes overlooking the surrounding forest and trees of many hundreds of years old are to be found. An abundance of marshy areas break the forest cover. The Mink√©b√© forest has four main rivers and there are also areas of grassland with elephant tracks. Accessibility to the park in many places is extremely limited due to the distinct lack of infrastructure in the park which has helped to protect the area and leave much of it unspoiled by human interference. Wildlife The forest elephant population is believed by the WWF to be one of the largest in Africa The western lowland gorilla in the park has been listed in the IUCN Red List The forest elephant is particularly important to the park and is believed by the WWF to contain one of the largest populations in Africa. The lesser forest in the park is inhabited by elephants, gorillas, and various small carnivores, porcupines, squirrels, african golden cats, leopards, giant pangolins, duikers and red river hog. The primary forest is inhabited by creatures such as mandrill, black colobus and chimpanzee. The western lowland gorilla, chimpanzee, black colobus, mandrill and golden potto have all been listed on the IUCN Red List. The riparian areas of the Mink√©b√© forest provide for creatures who require a water habitat, including the dwarf crocodile, spotted- necked otter, crested mangabey, sitatunga, and water chevrotain. The swampy areas interspersed with vegetation also includes habitat for parrots and python. The park contains some animals which are rare in Gabon including the bongo and the giant forest hog. Although the park itself is not permanently inhabited by humans, populations of Baka pygmy, Fang, Kota and Kw√®l ethnic groups live in the forest region and possess a rich cultural and superstitious heritage, The Kota mask, the forest spirit, Baka Edzengui, and the Kwel Deke dance are of cultural note in the region. Species of bird, including the spot- breasted ibis (Bostrychia rara) and Rachel's malimbe (Malimbus racheliae), are fairly common in the park, and the tree species Sterculia subviolacea is found in the national park and not found elsewhere in Gabon.

Armstrong helps its students re-enter traditional public and private schools with the learning tools necessary to be language proficient. Tuition, grants and donations support Charles Armstrong School, which is the only school of its kind in the San Francisco Bay Area. The school provides a full academic program, along with elective classes for middle school students, and extracurricular sports and drama activities. Charles Armstrong School is certified by the California State Board of Education and has received the highest rating from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. History Charles Armstrong School first opened its doors in 1968 to eighteen dyslexic children in the second, third and fourth grades. The school was housed in a renovated single dwelling home on University Drive in the downtown area of Menlo Park, and consisted of three classrooms and a business office. While the Charles Armstrong School opened in 1968, its roots may be traced to two occurrences some years before. In 1960, a group of concerned Bay Area parents first gathered to discuss a puzzling phenomenon ‚Äì the fact that their intelligent, motivated, and healthy children were unable to learn how to read. This group of parents began to meet in an attempt to find solutions to their children‚Äôs learning problems. They found that pediatricians were often helpful in diagnosing the condition, but were unable to suggest how the learning difficulties might be overcome. In an otherwise unrelated event, Charles D. Armstrong, physician and founder of the Menlo Medical Clinic died in 1962 at the age of 44. Eager to perpetuate the memory of a community leader whose brilliant career was suddenly cut short, friends and patients of Dr. Armstrong established The Charles Armstrong Memorial Foundation dedicated to ‚Äúimproving the well being of the community by applying today‚Äôs knowledge to today‚Äôs problems.‚Äù The plight of children with dyslexia was brought to the attention of the Foundation by the group of concerned and active Bay Area parents. The directors of The Armstrong Foundation were impressed by the importance and prevalence of the problem, and formed a committee led by director Wilbur E. Mattison, Jr., M.D., a colleague of Dr. Armstrong‚Äôs at the Menlo Medical Clinic, to survey the needs of Bay Area children with specific language disability. The Armstrong Foundation sponsored several symposia inviting medical and educational experts from around the nation to examine the nature of dyslexia, how it could be recognized, and most revolutionary at the time ‚Äì what could be done about it. One symposium in 1966 drew over one thousand parents, teachers, school administrators, physicians, and psychologists to listen to a panel discussion about this invisible disability and new teaching techniques that would enable the dyslexic learner to read. Initially the Charles Armstrong School‚Äôs academic program focused only on improving language skills, with the intent that after two or three years in the school, students would be equipped to re-enter a public or private school successfully. Later, the school added a full academic program and extracurricular activities. The school moved several times before purchasing the former McDougal Elementary School in Belmont, California, moving there in 1984. At one time Charles Armstrong School included a high school, but later returned to offering only the elementary and middle school. Charles Armstrong School has schooled over 3,000 students during its history.

He served as a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) from 1912 to 1922, and from 1935 to 1945. Early life Blair was born in Glasgow in 1881. He was educated at Kelvinside Academy and Glasgow University, after which he became an accountant. Blair was married, and had a son Malcolm Reginald Blair, who died on 31 May 1940, aged 33, while in active service in World War II. Early career Blair was first elected to Parliament in a by- election in the Bow and Bromley constituency on 26 November 1912. The by- election was caused by George Lansbury, the Labour MP, taking the Chiltern Hundreds, a way of resigning from the House of Commons. Lansbury caused the by-election to highlight the issue of women's suffrage, but the Labour Party did not endorse him as their candidate so he stood as an independent on a platform of \\"Votes for Women\\". Labour did not stand a candidate, and Blair won the by-election by a majority of 751 votes. For the first two years of World War I, Blair served with the British Expeditionary Force and was Mentioned in Despatches. From 1916 to 1918, he served as a field cashier with the temporary rank of Major. Reginald Blair held his seat in the 1918 general election, but was defeated in 1922 by Lansbury, who remained Bow and Bromley's MP until his death in 1940. Following his election defeat, Blair was knighted, and became the Chairman of the Racehorse Betting Control Board. Later career In the 1935 general election, Reginald Blair was elected as MP for Hendon, succeeding the Conservative Philip Cunliffe-Lister. On 19 June 1945, he was created a baronet, of Harrow Weald in the County of Middlesex. His Hendon seat was abolished for the 1945 general election, and he retired. Reginald Blair died in 1962, aged 80, and was buried in Harrow Cemetery in Harrow, London. The baronetcy became extinct on his death.

British neoconservatives are strong proponents of foreign intervention in the Arab world and beyond, the role of the private sector in military contracts and an alliance with Israel. History There is a suspicion in British public life of 'philosophy', which has meant that politicians in the UK rarely refer to any overarching theories. In The Centre-left and New Right Divide?: Political Philosophy and Aspects of UK Social Policy in the Era of the welfare State, for example,The Centre-left and New Right Divide?: Political Philosophy and Aspects of UK Social Policy in the Era of the Welfare State, author: Steven Smith, published in 1998, Steven Smith argues that academic explanations of the resilience of the welfare state in the face of the New Right reforms have focused on the social, political and economic processes that tend to bolster the activities of state welfare provision, rather than the underlying philosophies. Spinwatch describes Douglas Murray as 'the 'enfant terrible' of British neoconservatism. Murray is typical of the movement in arguing that the 'innate flaws of liberal democracy' leave Europe vulnerable to exploitation and domination by Islamic Fundamentalists; and that strong armed forces prepared to go to war are essential to the survival of what he sees as Conservative values. As head of the Centre for Social Cohesion his ideas have been influential in some NATO circles. Philosophically, he claims to be influenced by the authoritarianism of Leo Strauss, and the concept of dhimmitude as it was put forward by Bat Ye'or. accessed July 3, 2008 Murray's keynote book, Neoconservatism: Why We Need It was published by the Social Affairs Unit in 2005. An inspiration for Murray, who he frequently praises in the book, is the academic philosopher, Roger Scruton, who was part of a group of right-wing Cambridge University intellectuals under the influence of Maurice Cowling, an historian. In 1978 Cowling helped found the Salisbury GroupThe Salisbury Group publishes the Salisbury Review of conservative thinkers (named after the earlier British Prime Minister). In the same year Cowling published Conservative Essays which states: \\"If there is a class war - and there is - it is important that it should be handled with subtlety and skill. [...] It is not freedom that Conservatives want; what they want is the sort of freedom that will maintain existing inequalities or restore lost ones\\".Cowling, Maurice (1978). \\"The Present Position\\", in Cowling, Maurice (ed.): Conservative Essays. London: Cassell, p. 1, p. 9 The original Cambridge group however also included John Vincent, another historian, and Edward Norman, a theologian and historian. As Scruton says in his semi- autobiographical book, Gentle Regrets: Thoughts From a Life,Gentle Regrets: Thoughts From a Life by Roger Scruton, Continuum 2005 it influenced a new generation of neo-con thinkers including Charles Moore, former editor of The Daily Telegraph and the Chief Rabbi, Dr Jonathan Sacks. Scruton himself offers the French post-war President Charles De Gaulle as a model because the General defined the French nation in terms of its high culture, while detesting the philosopher Michael Foucault, who he says was 'one of the gurus' of his students, for shallow relativism and for teaching that \`truth' requires inverted commas. British neoconservatism has also been directly influenced by its US counterpart. One example is the Henry Jackson Society, founded in Cambridge in 2005, and named after Senator Henry 'Scoop' Jackson, a key influence on US neoconservatism.Henry Jackson Society Project for Democratic Geopolitics , Neocon Europe, accessed 3 June 2009.

MAG takes a humanitarian approach to landmine action. They focus on the impact of their work on local communities. This approach recognises that although the number of landmines in an area may be small, the effect on a community can be crippling. Targets are therefore determined locally, in response to liaison with affected communities, and local authorities. MAG field operations are managed and implemented by nationals of the affected countries, with MAG expatriate staff taking a monitoring and training role. MAG provides work for many members of affected communities, with families of landmine victims taking an active role. MAG is based in Manchester, United Kingdom, and has a sister organisation, MAG America in Washington, D.C., United States. As part of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, MAG was co-laureate of the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize.  History  MAG was formed in 1989 by Rae McGrath in response to landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) left by the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. The organisation initially served as an advisory group, publishing reports about the problems in Afghanistan and Cambodia based on their assessments between 1989 and 1991. Subsequent reports included Iraq, Somaliland and Angola. In 1992, MAG, along with other NGOs, formed the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL). By 1992, MAG had raised sufficient funds to begin its first landmine clearance program in Iraq. Clearance programmes extended to Cambodia the same year, followed by Laos and Angola in 1994. MAG also introduced mine risk education (MRE) alongside their clearance programs to help minimise the risk to the local populations. MRE operations were extended to Rwanda and to refugee camps in Zaire and the former Zambia. In 1996, Lou McGrath became executive director and MAG established its international headquarters in Manchester, United Kingdom.  Mine action techniques  Mine action teams (MATs) = MAG‚Äôs delivery of Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) is centred on the use of multi-skilled, highly mobile and flexible teams called MATs. These were developed by MAG in the mid- nineties in response to the varied needs of mine affected communities. Drawing on multi-skilled staff, MATs are able to quickly adapt to the many challenges presented not only by mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO), but also to changing environments, including weather, geographical and topographical conditions and the wider security and political climate. Drawing on many years of operational experience, MATs have proven highly successful in countries such as Iraq and Cambodia in delivering a comprehensive and flexible HMA response, with multi-skilling a central aspect of their success. Team members are trained in Community Liaison (CL), information/data gathering, survey and assessment, mapping, logistics, minefield marking, landmine clearance and ordnance disposal (EOD). = Survey and demarcation = MAG has successfully implemented national socio-economic Landmine Impact Surveys (LIS) which have consequently been published and widely distributed to mine action operators and other relevant stakeholders. MAG conducted its first emergency survey in Afghanistan in 1989 and conducted the first ever surveys in Cambodia and northern Iraq. Between 1992 and 1997, MAG Iraq conducted one of the largest minefield demarcation programmes in the world, while in Kosovo, MAG was tasked by the UN Mine Action Coordination Centre (MACC) in October 1999 to conduct a Level 2 survey along the border area with Albania. In 1993, MAG conducted an emergency impact assessment of the landmine problem in Moxico province, Angola, which led to the establishment of a MAG clearance programme later that year. = Mechanical = Mechanical capacities have formed an important element of MAG‚Äôs HMA toolbox for several years. Machines have been used successfully to support manual clearance operations in a number of countries, including Angola, Cambodia, Kosovo, Iraq, Lebanon, Sri Lanka and Vietnam. MAG uses a variety of flails, heavy plant and adapted agricultural and quarrying equipment in its programmes. Current mechanical assets include the Tempest flail, Bozena 4 flail, Armtrac 100 flail, Minecat 230 flail and Digger D-2 flail. These assets can be used for a variety of tasks, including clearance of land, area reduction, and quality assurance tasks in support of manual clearance operations. = Explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) = The hazard posed by explosive ordnance is often highly significant in post-conflict situations. A large percentage of ordnance fails to detonate as designed and poses an immediate threat to people trying to rebuild their lives in the aftermath of conflict. MAG‚Äôs EOD response in countries such as Laos includes categorisation; safe handling/moving of ordnance; and destruction of items such as grenades, mortars, shells, cluster bomb sub-munitions, small arms and light weapons and large air dropped bombs. MAG's flexible and multi-skilled approach to HMA means that it is well equipped to operate successfully in countries such as Laos and Vietnam where the explosive contamination is mainly UXO as opposed to landmines. = Mine detection dogs (MDDs) = MAG has used MDDs in support of its manual and mechanical clearance operations in a number of its programmes, including, northern Iraq, Cambodia and Lebanon. MAG technical staff have extensive experience of managing dog teams and/or integrating MDDs with manual and mechanical clearance operations. In particular, MDDs have proven a highly effective Quality Assurance tool for verification of manual/mechanical clearance sites. Rather than develop its own potentially expensive MDD capacity MAG works with local and international partners, such as CMAC in Cambodia and NPA in Lebanon who have existing dog capacities, to provide the required services. = Mine risk education (MRE) = MAG has developed the concept of MRE as a form of public health education. MRE offers people knowledge and alternatives for living and working safely in mine/UXO contaminated areas. MRE comprises a number of components that can be adapted to the needs of the target audience. Considerations include: the degree of impact of mines and UXO; economic pressures on affected communities; age; gender; culture; previous exposure to MRE messages; and the resources available to disseminate messages, such as local media, radio, television broadcasts and national networks such as schools, ministries and other institutions. = Community liaison (CL) = MAG pioneered the use of CL to ensure continual linkage with affected communities throughout the process of programme design, implementation and measurement of impact. This inclusive and community focused approach enables a relevant response whilst at the same time fostering high levels of community involvement. MAG‚Äôs CL Advisors also interact with relevant agencies, local authorities, HMA coordination bodies and other key stakeholders. CL consists of three main elements: * Information/data gathering‚Äîto prioritise action according to need and impact and to allow for effective task planning * Information sharing, networking, and ongoing contact with all stakeholders‚Äîto ensure that negotiation and planning occur regularly, to periodically review programme effectiveness, and to provide information about mine clearance activities * Evaluation and impact monitoring‚Äîto measure the success of activities, and determine how the programme has impacted on the lives of the local community and what changes have resulted. This learning process enables MAG to improve/refine its approaches and activities at community, national and international levels = SALW = A protracted series of armed conflicts have resulted in the presence of large numbers of SALW in unsafe conditions in many post-conflict countries; and this constitutes a constant risk not only to life and limb for the local population but also to the current peaceful transition process in the country. MAG removes and destroys unsecured and abandoned SALW caches and by doing so removes the threat posed by unsecured SALW. MAG conducts nationwide surveys of arms deposits and warehouses, puts in place specialist equipment and training of national staff to carry out the cache destruction activities, and provides advice for the safe storage and control of remaining items. MAG first became involved in the destruction of SALW by providing technical support to demobilisation programmes in Angola and Cambodia during the 1990s. More recently, the scale of the problem has become more apparent in the course of MAG's mine and UXO clearance activities in countries such as Iraq, Sudan and DRC and items have been removed or destroyed which are outside the limited scope of the Mine Ban Treaty but which qualify for SALW status and contribute to humanitarian impacts and the proliferation of conflict. = Local capacity development = As part of its mission to build local HMA capacities, MAG employs local technical and administrative staff wherever possible. In many of the countries it operates, including Angola, Cambodia and Iraq, MAG employs ex-combatants. A facet of this work contributes to the vital demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) of ex-combatants into post-conflict society. Stable employment with MAG allows ex-combatants and their families to adapt, economically and socially, to a productive, civilian life.  Current operations  MAG has worked in approximately 68 countries since 1989, moving into current and former conflict zones to clear the remnants of those conflicts. = Angola = MAG has worked in Angola since 1994, with the organisation‚Äôs current area of operations, Moxico Province, greatly affected by fighting. The region was the birthplace and once the relative stronghold of rebel leader Jonas Savimbi and his National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). Though the 27-year civil war ended in April 2002, the legacy of the conflict continues to affect the population. Angola is generally considered to have about two landmines for every single person, with 2.4 million people affected daily. The Landmine Impact Survey there identified 1,968 communities, in all 18 of the country's provinces, as being impacted by landmines. MAG‚Äôs Angola programme has approximately 180 Angolan staff, six international (non-Angolan) staff, five Mine Action Teams, one Rapid Response Team, one Road Ops Team, three Community Liaison Teams, two Mechanical Operations Units, consisting of five machines, and one Impact Assessment Team. = Cambodia = The office of MAG in Battambang MAG has been operational in Cambodia since 1992 and now employs approximately 475 staff members, working across six provinces: Battambang, Krong Pailin, Banteay Meanchey, Preah Vihear, Kampong Thom and Kampong Cham. Around 34 per cent are female and 9 per cent are amputees who are provided with metal-free prostheses by the International Committee of the Red Cross. There are currently 21 MATs (Mine Action Teams), 5 EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) Teams, 8 CL (Community Liaison) Teams, 1 Technical Survey Team; 4 Research and Development Teams (evaluating new technologies), 6 Mapping Teams, 9 Mechanical Support Teams, 3 scrub-cutting teams and 3 Mine Detection Dog Teams (sub-contracted from the Cambodian Mine Action Centre). ;Partnerships and coordination MAG's operations in Cambodia are conducted in association with The Cambodian Mine Action Authority, provincial mine planning units and other operators. At present, MAG works in partnership with many international bodies including CARE, World Vision, Church World Service (CWS) and the Lutheran World Federation (LWF). These partnerships ensure high levels of coordination in developing cleared land in the best way possible for local communities. MAG Cambodia has developed the locality demining approach; a more efficient and effective way of demining, recruiting deminers from the very communities that are mined. Working alongside development agencies, women and men are recruited from the most vulnerable households and trained in the fundamental skills of demining. Once trained, these teams then work under the supervision of more experienced staff. This approach enables poor families to gain meaningful employment and has resulted in productivity rise whilst still maintaining MAG's excellent safety record. MAG Cambodia has a well-developed Quality Management system, with the programme being accredited and quality assured by the Cambodian Mine Action Authority (CMAA). In 2003, MAG achieved a 50 per cent increase in output by introducing improved working methods and more mechanical scrub- cutting assets. In 2004 the introduction of small EOD teams in some areas reduced ordnance-related casualties by 50%. = Chad = After working on landmine, unexploded ordnance and abandoned ordnance clearance, and a project to restore access to safe water from 2004‚Äì2007, MAG restarted work in Chad in May 2008 clearing explosive hazards in central, eastern and southern parts of the country. This contamination mainly originates from fighting in recent years between the Chad National Army and various rebel groups. Two mobile destruction teams are conducting technical surveys, identifying clearance requirements and carrying out clearance and demarcation activities. In 2009 MAG also started clearance operations in the north of the country. Partnerships and Coordination MAG has a close partnership with the Haut Commission National de D√©minage (HCND), the National Chad Demining Office, and work with them when carrying out activities. MAG has established a good cooperation with HCND over the years and has provided substantial training to HCND Demining / EOD staff in order to enable HCND to mount and implement its own clearance activities. = Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) = MAG has been operational in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) since July 2004, working to reduce the threat posed by landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO)-clearing dangerous areas and using Mine Risk Education (MRE) to create safe access to water sources, agricultural land, medical facilities and education centres as well as destroying stockpiles of small arms and light weapons and ammunition. In the south eastern province of Katanga province and the north western province of Equateur, MAG has trained national staff in Community Liaison and clearance activities, creating seven teams (3 CL and 4 explosive ordnance disposal-trained). These teams work in contaminated areas where large numbers of returnees are expected over the coming years. During 2007, MAG teams provided Mine Risk Education for more than 263,000 people and cleared more than 243,000 square metres of land, destroying over 83,000 dangerous items in the process. In September 2006, a large scale Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) project was implemented, responsible for the safe destruction of surplus munitions and weapons nationwide, and a direct contribution to peace building in DRC and the Great Lakes region. However, the presence of Small Arms and Light Weapons remains high and constitutes an ongoing threat to the stability and development of the country as a whole. At present, MAG has four mobile destruction teams operating in the Third, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Military Regions (Equateur, Kasai Oriental, Katanga and Maniema provinces) and has trained a team of FARDC (Congolese Joint Forces) technicians to operate MAG's Regional Construction Centre at the Central Logistics Base in Kinshasa. Destruction activities were completed in the First Military Region (Bandundu) in March 2008, and will be completed in the Secondary Military Region (Bas-Congo) over the coming months. Work will also soon begin in Kasai Occidental. In addition to this, MAG has been asked to intervene urgently in the 8th Military Region (Nord Kivu) to destroy unsafely stored ammunition in order to prevent another accident such as Camp Ngashi. In DRC, since May 2007, MAG has destroyed 70,000 weapons and over 150 tons of surplus ammunition previously held in Congolese Military stores. ;Partnerships and Coordination Since the opening of a liaison office in Kinshasa in January 2005, MAG has become increasingly active in establishing partnerships with the international NGO community, as well as working with the local UN Mine Action Coordination Centre. MAG also cooperates with local NGOs in the field who are able to provide invaluable information regarding local mine/UXO problems. A partnership for organisational and technical capacity building has been signed until 2012 with Humanitas Ubangi, a local organisation working on MRE in the province of Equateur and hoping to extend to the Kasais. Additionally, MAG maintains a regular dialogue with relevant government and military authority and has entered into a partnership agreement through an MOU with a national NGO Humanitas Ubangi to develop its organisational and technical capacity to undertake Humanitarian Mine Action activities. = Iraq = MAG has been conducting Humanitarian Mine Action in the heavily mine-affected north of the country since 1992, and since the most recent conflict efforts have concentrated on delivering vital services in northern and central areas of the country. This work significantly reduces the threat to both resident and transient populations, and has supported wider rehabilitation and socio- economic development initiatives. Up to date, MAG has cleared more than one and a half million landmines and items of UXO, freeing several million square metres of land for use by the local population. MAG's Iraq programme has recently also launched a dedicated project to safely remove and destroy small arms and light weapons, acting to support peace keeping initiatives which aim for long-term stability in Iraq. Currently, MAG Iraq has more than 750 national staff working in the programme.This capacity consists of 18 Mine Action Teams, which provide a highly responsive and mobile multi-skilled clearance capacity, trained to International Mine Action Standards (IMAS); 10 Community Liaison teams; 2 midi-flail machines and operating teams; and 4 MDD teams. And despite security constraints, MAG remains operational in the North and parts of the centre and continues to implement operations. The programme works with local and regional partners in unstable parts of Iraq to reduce the threat posed by remnants of conflict to vulnerable high-risk communities. Partnerships and Coordination MAG works with the National Mine Action Authority (NMAA) located in Baghdad, the Iraqi Kurdistan Mine Action Authority (IKMAA) and the General Directorate of Mine Action (GDMA) in the North. MAG also coordinates with UN agencies, local and regional government authorities and other organisations involved in humanitarian, rehabilitation and reconstruction initiatives throughout Iraq. As part of its commitment to national capacity building, MAG has been working in partnership with the Kurdish Ministries of Education and Health to develop a sustainable and independent Mine Risk Education (MRE) delivery capacity in Northern Iraq. = Laos = MAG's Laotian programme began in 1994 with the establishment of the first internationally supported UXO (Unexploded Ordnance) clearance operation in the country. MAG currently works in XiangKhouang and Khammouane provinces, operating 11 UXO clearance teams (including two all-female teams) and 9 Community Liaison teams. The programme has 211 national staff, of which 35% are female. MAG continued to pursue an integrated UXO action approach, which was subsequently developed and adopted nationally in 1996 with the creation of the Lao government‚Äôs national UXO organisation, UXO Lao. MAG has the distinction of having handed over to UXO Lao, two effective and efficient operations in the provinces of Xieng Khouang and Saravan. Since 2000, MAG has continued to support the activities of UXO Lao, providing operational and technical advice to these provincial operations and MAG is also now providing technical assistance to UXO Lao in a third province: Khammouane. Recent sector reform has enabled international NGOs and Government of Lao (GoL) provincial authorities to ask MAG to assist with clearance linked to specific development projects in XiangKhouang and Khammouane, especially in areas where UXO Lao is unable to respond. In addition, MAG has piloted the use of UXO detection dogs and Village Assisted Clearance (VAC) to improve productivity and impact. In 2007 MAG Lao located and destroyed 6,460 items of UXO, 3,257,638 square metres of land was cleared for agriculture, drainage canals, electricity pylons, water wells, school gardens, roads (to provide access to markets) and for a project to promote tourism at the historic Plain of Jars. From January to June 2008, MAG Lao destroyed 3,537 items of UXO. The work of MAG teams in Laos is the focus of the 2007 documentary movie Bomb Harvest. Additionally, MAG teams were featured in the 2017 documentary feature film Blood Road, winning a Shorty Award for social good with partnering with MAG and their demining efforts.  Community Liaison  Almost 15 percent of field staff are members of Community Liaison teams, devoted to ensuring that communities are consulted and involved throughout the whole UXO clearance process. The information gained through Community Liaison ensures that UXO clearance is directly linked with poverty alleviation. = Lebanon = UXO in Rachaf, Lebanon MAG began its HMA activities in Southern Lebanon in 2000 and now employs 80 national staff members on new and existing projects. Following the 2006 ceasefire, this figure rose to around 360 nationally recruited employees. In 2003, MAG Lebanon completed a national Landmine Impact Survey (LIS), which was carried out in conjunction with the National Demining Office (NDO). Another team also conducted a technical survey into suspected contaminated areas along the 'Blue Line'. During the conflict between Hezbollah and Israeli forces from mid-July to mid-August 2006, there was a dramatic change in the mine/unexploded ordnance (UXO) situation. The fighting and artillery bombardments were heaviest in southern Lebanon, and as a result, an estimated 915,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) fled this area and scattered throughout communities further north. Over 200,000 refugees left the country entirely. Roads and communities in southern Lebanon were littered with UXO thus making movement throughout South Lebanon both difficult and dangerous. Immediately prior to the conflict situation MAG deployed 4 MATs and 1 Mechanical team who went operational in June 2006. The flexibility of this MAT team meant that immediately after the cessation of violence MAG had a team on the ground responding to the most immediate threats. Since the immediate post- conflict phase, MAG has steadily worked on 'battle area clearance' (BAC), which concentrates on removing cluster submunitions and UXO. From the end of 2006 conflict, MAG Lebanon's capacity grew to 22 Mine Action Teams (MATs), 5 Mechanical Teams, 2 Mine Dog Detection teams, 3 Community Liaison Teams (responsible for gathering information from the community on remnants of conflict), 1 Technical Survey Team, 1 Reconnaissance Team (responsible for surveying battle areas), and 1 Quality Control/ Quality Assurance Team (responsible for training and monitoring operations quality). Since the end of the 2006 conflict, MAG has cleared more than 9.8 million square metres of land, destroyed almost 21 000 remnants of conflict, cleared 294 dangerous areas, and assisted 450,000 people at risk from death or injury from remnants of conflict. The scope of activities carried out by MAG Lebanon's programme includes rapid survey and demarcation of landmine and UXO contaminated areas, clearance of priority routes and land, and explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) tasks. Alongside this, integration of MAG Lebanon's activities with those of the NDO (National Demining Office) and other organizations operating in the region remains a priority. MAG has positive working relationships with key organisations such as the United Nations Mine Action Coordination Centre South Lebanon (MACC SL) and The Lebanese Red Cross. = Mali = MAG is delivering Risk Education messages to internally displaced people, returnees and resident populations in northern Mali. = Myanmar = MAG began work in Kayah state, Myanmar in 2014, giving lifesaving Mine Risk Education (MRE) to communities dependent for their livelihoods on land that is riddled with mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) from decades of internal conflict. = Somalia = Funded by the Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement, U.S. Department of State, MAG began its current operations in Somalia in May 2008 with a project to clear conventional weapons and stockpiles in conflict-affected areas in the Puntland region. Work is centred in the administrative capital of the region, Garowe, where a unit of the local police force is receiving Explosive Ordnance Disposal training ‚Äì covering munitions recognition, the safe handling of explosive ordnance, conducting safe demolitions, first aid and communications. Once the training is complete, MAG will support and advise the team as they carry out operations around Puntland. Following an accident in July 2008, concerning some children who were playing with a 106mm high explosive anti- tank round that exploded on a school football field (three died and six were injured), MAG held meetings with the elders of the town, made appeals for information, gave Mine Risk Education (MRE) on the local radio and collected other items reported by the community. It is anticipated that further small arms and light weapons (SALW) and UXO clearance of the country is required to remove these threats, to prevent further accidents and to ensure safe access and use of the land. ;Partnerships and Coordination MAG carries out activities in Somalia in close coordination with the PMAC. MAG has also established a good relationship with UNDP Somalia who provide support to MAG‚Äôs current operation in Puntland. MAG is also working in cooperation with Geneva Call. = Sri Lanka = MAG began emergency MRE, survey and demarcation activities in the Vanni region of northern Sri Lanka in February 2002. The aim of the MAG teams were to address the outstanding problems of landmine and UXO contamination apparent following the ceasefire (Memorandum of Understanding) between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Through deploying Mine Risk Education (MRE), survey and demarcation assets in Northern Sri Lanka, MAG teams sought to protect those most affected by the conflict which had plagued the region since 1983. Later in 2002, clearance assets, including manual, mechanical and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) were introduced to the programme structure. In August 2003, MAG expanded into the eastern district of Batticaloa, where it remains, providing vital conflict recovery assistance. In May 2005, as a result of the December tsunami, MAG established a landmine and UXO response in Ampara district. MAG's capacity in Sri Lanka in its three project locations has grown to include five CL/MRE teams, three emergency EOD teams, nine technical survey/demining teams, one minefield marking/fencing team, two general survey teams specifically tasked to support NGOs and local authorities undertaking development projects, one Battle Area Clearance (BAC) team and two MATs. In addition, MAG runs two Mechanical Support Units utilising Bozena mini flails. Since the start of operations in 2002, MAG has cleared 15,500,000 square metres through manual, mechanical, and Battle Area Clearance (BAC) techniques. In 2006 the security situation worsened between the Government and the TRO, forcing MAG to scale down its operations within Sri Lanka significantly, but restarted in September 2007 when MAG undertook tasking in Trincomalee district, responding to support the Ministry of Resettlements in their resettlement plans. All MAG assets returned to Batticola in October 2007 and since then MAG has concentrated on tasks only in the Batticaloa district due to a lack of access to the Northern region. At present, MAG fields one Community Liaison team, three Manual Mine Clearance Teams, and two Mechanical Ground Preparation Teams‚Äîeach deploying a 'Bozena 4' mini flails. MAG has already begun survey in an area of Mannar District in the north where the population had to leave quickly in late 2007 during fighting in the area. Five villages were surveyed in April 2009, and the area has been declared safe for the families to return. MAG now plans to expand its activities in the north throughout the remainder of the year in support of the initiative to return 80 per cent of IDPs back to their home areas by the end of 2009. Mine Action in Sri Lanka is coordinated through the National Steering Committee for Mine Action (NSCMA) which is supported though by UNDP. MAG works in coordination with the NSCMA and also through district Mine Action Committees, where communication with all stakeholders allows contaminated areas to be priorised for clearance and district work plans to be produced. = South Sudan = MAG has been operational in South Sudan since 1998. At present, MAG has teams carrying out landmine clearance, bomb disposal and destruction of abandoned small arms and light weapons (SALW). MAG also have Community Liaison/Mine Risk Educational teams delivering important messages to settled populations, the internally displaced and returnees living in contaminated areas. = Vietnam = As the largest non-military clearance organisation operating in Vietnam, MAG plays a key role in reducing the risk and impact of mines/UXO on the local population, and also in facilitating community level post-clearance development and resettlement. MAG first began operating in Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province, central Vietnam, in 1999- encompassing the former DMZ (Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone), which divided Vietnam and witnessed the majority of flighting and bombing during the 1960s and '70s. In early 2003, MAG's operations were expanded to the adjacent province of Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh. Most of MAG's work is mobile explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) operations, whereby teams systematically work through every village in a commune, clearing all known items of UXO and suspect items. From 1999 to the end of July 2008, MAG achieved the following outputs in Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã and Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh provinces: *Teams cleared 6,708,715 square metres of land using manual electronic and visual search techniques, removing 22,573 items of UXO and 2,040 mines. *Teams also visited 181,125 houses, performing 24,931 EOD tasks and removing 110,663 items of UXO and 439 mines. Since November 2007, Community Liaison teams have conducted 324 community/partner meetings, visiting 255 villages, conducting 7,253 house to house surveys and documenting 962 mine/UXO reports. MAG's work is closely linked to the development plans of the provinces, districts and communities in which it operates. The teams have cleared areas for a wide range of development activities and also respond to emergency EOD requests. MAG's current operational capacity in Vietnam consists of 5 MATs in Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province and 4 MATs in Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh Province and 4 recently introduced Community Liaison teams. In addition, MAG provides technical assistance and quality assurance to mine action projects in Th·ª´a Thi√™n‚ÄìHu·∫ø and Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i provinces. MAG Vietnam also respond to emergency EOD requests. Humanitatian mine action is also linked to the development plans of the provinces, districts and communities. MAG Vietnam is committed to forming partnerships with government authorities at both national and local level, NGOs, and other agencies. To date, all projects have been either in partnership with the local authorities or with development organisations. MAG is a regular participant in the Landmine Working Group, a group of NGOs, UN agencies and other organisations concerned with the mine/UXO issue in Vietnam. In addition to this, MAG has developed working partnerships with poverty reduction agencies such as CHF-partners in rural development in order to link MAG Vietnam's clearance work to the Millennium Goal of poverty reduction. These partnerships ensure that land and villages cleared by MAG is used in the most productive and sustainable way, while meeting the needs of the local population.  Past operations  Afghanistan = Ongoing since 2002: MAG trained the Organisation for Mine Clearance and Afghan Rehabilitation to address new types of UXO found after the coalition activity in the area. Mechanical assistance is also being provided. = Azerbaijan = Training local partners in the Fizuli district close to the front line with areas still occupied by Armenian forces. = Burundi = In 2007 MAG began assisting Burundi's government after civil war left the country with the burden of small arms and light weapons (SALW), and unsecured stockpiles. Strained relations between the government and rebel groups have helped facilitate the spread of SALW throughout the civilian population. The situation has deteriorated further as a result of Burundi‚Äôs permeable frontiers and the inadequate enforcement of illegal arms trade legislation. MAG works with Burundi's government to eliminate the threat of SALW and unsecured stockpiles. Their work in Burundi involves assisting the national army to destroy Man-Portable Air Defence Systems (MANPADS), and training and equipping members of the army and police force to become Mobile SALW destruction teams. These teams work throughout the country, destroying seized SALW, small arms ammunition (SAA) and explosives. When necessary the teams also respond to identified unexploded ordnance (UXO) spot tasks. = Cyprus = Since October 2004, MAG has been contracted in Cyprus by the United Nations. They provide quality management for the work of commercial contractors, who clear minefields between the Greek Cypriot- and Turkish Cypriot-controlled regions of the country. Cyprus‚Äôs landmine contamination is estimated to span nine million square metres and consists of 77 minefields or suspected minefields. MAG's work in Cyprus, based in Nicosia, safeguards the quality of work conducted by other UN contractors, and ensures that their work complies with international standards. Contractors must execute clearance work safely and efficiently, and MAG provides the management and maintenance of a mine detection dog accreditation and testing database. = Republic of Congo = MAG started working in the Republic of Congo in late 2007, alongside the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Congo, to try to prevent the risk from any remnants of conflict. Its aims are to make a material contribution to peace-building initiatives and security efforts in the Republic of Congo through identifying, surveying and destroying small arms and light weapons, MANPADS (Man-Portable Air Defence Systems) and other explosive ordnance, which currently poses a hazard due to their degraded state, storage conditions and proximity to local communities. = Rwanda = In August 2008, MAG, alongside the Regional Centre on Small Arms (RECSA), carried out a survey to determine the status of small arms and light weapons activities that were going on in Rwanda. As a result of this, they managed to get funding off the UK Government Conflict Prevention Pool to start a four- month Conventional Weapons Management and Disposal project. It includes assisting the Rwandan Army and Police, and also provides training, in stockpile management and destruction of surplus weapons, unstable ordnance and small arms ammunition. As a result of this over 10,000 weapons have already been destroyed. MAG's work is beneficial for communities situated near stockpiles, as it reduces death and injury caused by them. It also benefits the wider population, who before MAG started this project, were threatened by the risk of violent crime that followed looting of the weapons that had been insecurely stored. MAG have also trained army personnel in stockpile management, weapons destruction and basic Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) skills to make up a Destruction Team, who then started weapons destruction activities which were supervised and supported by the MAG Technical Field Manager. After this a weapons destruction workshop was set up. This project ran up until March 2009, during which time MAG, along with the Rwandan Authorities, established some further priorities and decided what work was to be done from April 2009 onwards. = Somaliland = October 2001 to July 2002: MAG worked with the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS). Established and trained an EOD team composed of Somaliland police personnel and a member of the Somaliland Mine Action Centre (SMAC).

He may have been based on one of Goldsmith's friends. The story goes that Oliver Goldsmith wrote the play while staying with the Lumpkin family at Park House in Leverington, near Wisbech and that he lampooned his friend, Nicholas Lumpkin, by turning him into his famous creation, Tony Lumpkin. Tony Lumpkin is the son of Mrs Hardcastle and stepson to Mr Hardcastle. It is as a result of his practical joking that the comic aspects of the play are set up. When he accidentally meets Charles Marlow and his friend Hastings, who are coming to see Tony's parents in order to put Marlow forward as a suitor to Tony's stepsister Kate, he deliberately misdirects them, causing them to believe that the house where they are bound is an inn and that the Hardcastles are its landlord and landlady. Tony is promised in marriage to his cousin, Constance Neville, which he despises, and therefore he assists in her plans to elope with Hastings. Tony takes an interest in horses, \\"Bet Bouncer\\" and especially the alehouse, where he joyfully sings with members of the lower-classes. It is Tony's initial deception of Marlow, for a joke, which sets up the plot. Reportedly the part was originally intended for the Irish actor William Hamilton but he was replaced by John Quick before the production.* Highfill, Philip H, Burnim, Kalman A. & Langhans, Edward A.

The play was still popular in England in the mid- nineteenth century, where it was being played by the likes of Lionel Brough. She stoops to conquer was chosen as the play to relaunch the Georgian Angles Theatre in Wisbech, the town where the real Lumpkin moved to from Leverington after spending all his money.

It occurred on March 24, 1996, on the Philippine island of Marinduque, a province of the Philippines located in the Mimaropa region. The disaster led to drastic reforms in the country's mining policy. A fracture in the drainage tunnel of a large pit containing leftover mine tailings led to a discharge of toxic mine waste into the Makulapnit-Boac river system and caused flash floods in areas along the river. One village, Barangay Hinapulan, was buried in six feet of muddy floodwater, causing the displacement of 400 families. Twenty other villages had to be evacuated. Drinking water was contaminated killing fish and freshwater shrimp. Large animals such as cows, pigs and sheep were overcome and killed. The flooding caused the destruction of crops and irrigation channels. Following the disaster, the Boac River was declared unusable. History Marcopper Mining was a Canadian corporation that officially started its copper mining operations in 1969 at the Mt. Tapian Ore Deposit on Marinduque Island in the Philippines. When the Mt. Tapian reserve was depleted in 1990, Marcopper moved its operations to the San Antonio copper mine, three kilometers north of the Mt. Tapian site. Mine tailings from the Mt. Tapian site were discharged into Calancan Bay. It is estimated that 84 million metric tons of mine tailings were discharged into the shallow bay between 1975 and 1988. Complaints from local residents led to the Mt. Tapian open-cut mine site being converted to receive mine tailings from the San Antonio mine on a temporary basis. Marcopper plugged up the Mt. Tapian pit with a concrete fixture to allow it to act as a disposal lake for the mining waste. The use of the Tapian Pit as a waste containment system was unconventional. Environmental risk assessment and management had not been carried out by Marcopper.The Marinduque Island Mine Disaster, Philippines The Marinduque Mines operated by Marcopper dumped waste into the shallow bay of Calancan for 16 years, totaling 200 million tons of toxic tailings.Paradise to Toxic Wasteland When exposed to ocean breezes, the tailings, which partially floated, become airborne and landed on rice fields, in open water wells, and on village homes. Local residents called this their \\"Snow from Canada.\\"One photojournalist witnessed the toxic effects of Canadian gold mining on three remote Philippine communities This \\"Snow from Canada,\\" consisting of mine tailings, forced 59 children to undergo lead detoxification in the Philippine capital of Manila. At least three children have died from heavy metal poisoning.Oxfam Report Mining disaster This disaster at the Marcopper Mines on Marinduque made headlines around the world. In August 1996, a significant leak was discovered in the pit's drainage tunnel. The leak caused a fracture which discharged tailings into the Makulapnit-Boac river system. This released over 1.6 million cubic meters of tailings along 27 km of the river and coastal areas. The impact on the river and people who depend on it for their livelihoods were severe. The rush of tailings displaced river water which inundated low-lying areas, destroying crops and vegetable gardens and clogged irrigation channels supplying water to rice fields. The release left the Boac River virtually unusable. The effects of the incident were so devastating that a United Nations assessment mission declared the accident to be a major environmental disaster.Philippine Mining Disaster: Counting the Cost of a Ruined River The Tapian pit contained around 23 million metric tons of mine waste. Officials of the DENR (Department of Environment and Natural Resources) claimed they did not know of the presence of the drainage tunnel that measured 2.6 kilometres long and 1 metre wide which was located underneath the pit, which led to the Makulapnit and Boac river system. The toxic spill caused flash floods which isolated five villages, with populations of 4,400 people each, along the far side of the Boac river. One village, Barangay Hinapulan, was buried under six feet of muddy floodwater, causing 400 families to flee to higher grounds. Sources of drinking water were contaminated with toxins. Fish, freshwater shrimp and pigs were killed outright. Helicopters had to fly in food, water and medical supplies to the isolated villages. The inhabitants of 20 of the 60 villages in the province were told to evacuate.The Marcopper toxic mine disaster -Philippines' biggest industrial accident Aftermath The government estimates this toxic tailings waste killed P1.8 million worth of freshwater and marine life and P5 million milk fish fry. The 27-kilometer Boac river, which was the main source of livelihood for those who did not work for Marcopper, was declared unusable by government officials.Environmental Justice Case Study After the disaster, Marcopper and Placer Dome closed all their mines. The government attempted to cover up the fact they had not enforced environmental laws throughout the years. The local residents in Marinduque have claimed they knew about the tunnel for almost 20 years. Evidence came to light that Marcopper knew of the leak in the drainage tunnel in advance of the accident, as there had been a long history of problems regarding the tunnel and pit. = Health issues = On 17 April 1996, a Department of Health (DOH) report said that residents may already be harboring quantities of zinc and copper beyond tolerable limits. Nine residents were found to have zinc in their blood more than 200% above safe levels. Water samples also revealed dangerous levels of contamination i.e. 1,300% above the human tolerable level of 0.5 micro-gram per 1/1000 litres of water. Residents complained of skin irritations and respiratory problems which could have been caused by poisonous vapors such as hydrogen sulfide and nitrous oxide from mine wastes. Despite the findings, Marcopper claimed the tailings were non-toxic. In 2016, the DOH regional office called Marinduque a health emergency due to the effects of the Marcopper disaster. = Policy reforms = A year before the disaster, the Philippine Mining Act was enacted to push for the liberalization of the country's mining industry. The Marcopper mining disaster led to significant changes in the government's mining policies. The disaster prompted government to revise the rules of the Mining Act to focus more on the protection of the environment and address social issues. Higher standards for rehabilitation were set and stronger provisions on no-go areas were put into place. Consultations with local governments and indigenous communities also became a priority. = Investigation and findings = Oxfam, an international development and humanitarian aid agency with projects in the Philippines was approached by Marinduque community members for help. Oxfam Australia‚Äôs Mining Ombudsman took their case and released a report. The report calls on Placer Dome to complete an environmental clean-up, adequately compensate affected communities, and take steps to prevent future disasters. The report updates similar findings made by the United States Geological Survey in July 2004. As of 2005 Placer Dome (which ran the mine at the time of the disaster) was the sixth largest gold mining company in the world and was listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange,From Paradise to Toxic Wasteland, MiningWatch Canada, August 24, 2005 but it has since been acquired and is no longer an independent company. At the time of the incident Marinduque was identified as among the 44 poorest of the 80 provinces in the Philippines.Poverty Statistics Poorest 44 Provinces , National Statistical Coordination Board, 2000 Inspection of the site has been difficult because the area is off-limits, even to environment and local officials. =Legal action= On October 4, 2005, the provincial government of Marinduque sued Marcopper's parent company, Placer Dome, for $100 million in damages. Placer Dome was purchased in 2006 by Barrick Gold, who has joined the lawsuit.Philippine Province Sues Canadian Mining Giant Placer DomePhilippines province sues Placer Dome, alleging environmental damage As of 2017, the provincial government had been preparing to file a new case against Placer Dome and Barrick Gold for environmental damage in the municipalities of Boac and Mogpog.

Biography He was born in Wimbledon, London and educated at Harrow School. He subsequently studied music in Frankfurt, where he was a piano pupil of Clara Schumann. =Friendship with Siegfried Wagner= Harris became intimate friends with Siegfried Wagner after meeting him in 1889 at a soir√©e at the house of Edward Speyer. Becoming restless after spending the summer of 1891 in Bayreuth with Siegfried, Harris proposed taking a free trip to the far East on one of his rich father's ships. In 1892, Siegfried travelled to London where Harris introduced him to Oscar Wilde. Harris is described as a protege of Wilde's for whom Harris would perform [Richard] Wagner transcriptions. Wilde liked to talk with Harris about 'the most marvellous of all things; painting, music, love'. Siegfried and Harris embarked on The Wakefield for a trip that would last almost six months. It transpired that they were the only two passengers on the ship. When Siegfried later wrote his memoirs he devoted over half the book to his recollections of this trip. During the voyage both men spent much of the time working on their respective musical compositions: Siegfried planned the structure of his symphonic poem Sehnsucht (Yearning) whilst Harris sketched themes for his orchestral work Paradise Lost after Milton. Both pieces were premiered in 1895. Siegfried's memoirs recall how the pair ate cat and dog meat in Canton, bathed nude on a Malaysian beach, and were serenaded by a harpist in the Philippines. In Hong Kong, Harris helped Siegfried made the momentous decision to abandon his goal of becoming an architect and instead choose a composing and conducting career. When The Wakefield docked at Port Said, Siegfried decided to quickly return to Bayreuth in time for the festival's rehearsals. In his 1892 Reisetagebuch, but not in his memoir, Siegfried recalled their parting. > My dear Clement accompanied me on board where we said goodbye, superficially > because lots of people were milling around us, but in our hearts with that > affection and intimacy with which we had learned to love one another. When, in 1922‚Äì23, Siegfried Wagner composed the symphonic poem Gl√ºck (Happiness) he evidently dedicated it to \\"the dear friend whose picture never left his desk\\". Carr concludes that for all Siegfried's emotional entanglements, both male and female, much suggests that in Clement Harris, Siegfried found amd lost the love of his life. Career Clement Harris's works included pieces for piano, including Il pensieroso and L'Allegro after Milton, romances for violin and piano and clarinet, cello and piano,The Romances were published by B.

The building is famous for being the site of Winston Churchill's March 5, 1946 \\"Sinews of Peace\\" speech, in which he coined the phrase \\"Iron Curtain\\" to characterize the growing Cold War. In 1968, the gymnasium was designated a National Historic Landmark. Description and history The Westminster College Gymnasium stands prominently on the western edge of the greensward created by the CF Lampkin Drive, a loop road providing access to a portion of the college's campus. It is a two-story brick building, , with Classical Revival features. The front is five bays wide, with the center three projecting. The bays of the central portion are articulated by fluted Corinthian pilasters, and are topped by tall decorative parapet. Windows on the upper floor are set in round-arch windows, while those in the first floor are regular sash. The interior of the building is arranged with a central lobby flanked by office wings, and the gymnasium arena occupying most of the rear of the structure. The interior, in particular the gym space, has been relatively little altered since its construction, which was in 1928‚Äì29. Westminster College decided to invite Winston Churchill to make a speech on its campus in 1946, during a planned trip. Churchill's agreement was secured through the work of Major General Harry Vaughan, a Westminster alumnus on the staff of United States President Harry S. Truman. Churchill agreed, and the speech he delivered on March 5, before a crowd of 2,000 in this gym, has since been immortalized for its dramatic description of the political climate in Europe. He stated that > From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has > descended across the Continent. The speech focused on the United Nations, nuclear proliferation and expansionist activities of the Soviet Union. Although the speech was initially not well received, it was one of the first high-profile expressions of the growing Cold War environment, and the \\"Iron Curtain\\" phrase eventually became a useful metaphor for the division of Europe during that period. Westminster College maintains a museum devoted to Churchill in another building.

Its object was to condemn a two-fold doctrine then current: That the soul of man is of its nature mortal, and that it is one and the same soul which animates all men. Others, prescinding from the teaching of revelation, held that doctrine to be true according to natural reason and philosophy. Leo X condemned the doctrine in itself and from every point of view. He refers to the definition of the Council of Vienne (1311) published by Pope Clement V (1305‚Äì14) which taught that the soul is \\"really, of itself, and essentially, the form of the body\\";Hefele-Kn√∂pfler, \\"Conciliengeschichte\\", VI, 536-542; Denzinger-Stahl, \\"Enchiridion Symb. et Definit.\\", 9th ed. (Freiburg, 1899) 136-137. and then declares that it is of its own nature immortal, and that each body has a soul of its own. This doctrine is said to be clear from those words of the Gospel, \\"But he cannot kill the soul\\", and \\"he who hates his soul in this world preserves it for eternal life\\". Moreover, if the condemned doctrine were true, the Incarnation would have been useless, and we should not need the Resurrection; and those who are the most holy would be the most wretched of all. The Bull enjoins on all professors of philosophy in universities to expound for their pupils the true doctrine and refute the false one. To prevent such errors in future, the Bull makes it obligatory on all ecclesiastics, secular and regular, in holy orders, who devote their time to the study of philosophy and poetry for five years after the study of grammar and dialectic, to study also theology or canon law.

Mount Banks is located from the nearest residential area, Mount Tomah, has an elevation of AMSL, and can be accessed relatively easily via the Bells Line of Road. Geography Mount Banks is part of the Explorers Range, which is located along the northern escarpment of the Grose Valley in the Blue Mountains National Park. The Explorers Range starts at Bells Line of Road and extends along the northern edge of the Grose Valley. Mount Banks is the first noticeable peak along the range and is found about from Bells Line of Road. It was named Mount Banks in 1804 by the explorer George Caley, who had worked for the botanist Sir Joseph Banks. Caley who was the first European to reach Mount Banks. The distinctive thing about Mount Banks is the way the terrain and vegetation change radically approaching the top of the mountain. For the first two-thirds of the walk, the terrain is the triassic sandstone, often seen in the Blue Mountains, with a thin, rough scrub. After this, however, there is a basalt cap which gives rise to a richly vegetated environment with grass and a canopy. Views can be had on the lower slopes of the mountains but there is no view at the top, unless the walker edges down the slope towards the escarpment, at which point there are views of the Grose Valley. =Description= An unsealed road goes from Bells Line of Road to a picnic area about from the junction. At this point, vehicular access comes to an end. From the picnic area, a walking track makes its way approximately to the top of Mount Banks, where there is a trigonometric station. This is above sea level. From this point on, there is a fire trail that follows the Explorers Range before terminating above Zobel Gully. According to the topographic map, there is an abandoned mine in Zobel Gully, but there is no track to it. Activities The area is popular for bushwalking, with extensive views of the Grose Valley from the lower slopes of the mountain and from the fire trail where it goes close to Banks Wall, about south of the mountain. Photography is also popular because of the extensive views. There is no authorised camp site at Mt. Banks and camping at this fragile world heritage site is strictly prohibited.

While, in the past, games were often toned down when translated overseas, in terms of violence, religious references, profanity, drug use, etc., when compared to their Japanese counterparts, in recent years Computer Entertainment Rating Organization (CERO), among other ratings organizations, have imposed harsher restrictions on violent games. Third generation (1985-1993) *Bionic Commando - The game was renamed from , the character of Adolf Hitler was renamed \\"Master-D\\", the Nazis are renamed \\"The Badds\\" in-game (they're referred to as \\"The Nazzs\\" in the instruction manual) and all swastikas were edited into a German eagle insignia. *Contra - Released in Europe as Probotector, replaces the human combatants with robots due to a German law that bans video games that allows shooting people. *Punch Out!! - The character Vodka Drunkenski has his name changed to Soda Popinski in its English release. Fourth generation (1988-1997) *EarthBound - In the North American version, a few of the game's materials been edited from the Japanese version. For example, Ness appears clothed in pyjamas instead of appearing naked. References to death were less obvious, a punishment is changed from spanking to loss of dessert, the phrase \\"Die and go to Hell\\" is replaced with \\"I'll smash your guts out!\\". *Final Fantasy IV - In the North American version, references to Christianity were altered or removed from the game, as well as certain religious images. The magic spell Holy has been renamed White (Though the Elder of Mysidia uses the word Holy in describing a sword). All references to prayer are eliminated; the Tower of Prayers in Mysidia is renamed the Tower of Wishes (though the White Mage in the tower still calls it \\"Tower of Prayers\\"); and Rosa's Pray command is absent. Direct references to death are omitted, although several characters clearly die over the course of the game. Anything considered too risqu√© has been censored, such as bikinis on town dancers (replaced by leotards). The Programmers' Room special feature (in which the player can find a pornographic magazine) has been removed. New promotional character art was made for published previews. *Final Fantasy VI - In the North American SNES version, the town signs originally called Pub have been changed to Cafe. Also, the nudity with Espers such as the \\"Siren\\" has her butt covered with a skirt, so Starlet now has her dress on. Also, the enemies such as Critic, Alluring, the boss Chadarnook and Goddess now wear more clothes. Smoking has been toned down with the smoke taken out of the following enemies sprites: \\"Madam\\", \\"L. 80 Magic\\", \\"Dahling\\" and \\"Barb-e.\\" Two spells were renamed as well, the Death spell was renamed Doom, and Death Gaze was renamed Doom Gaze. *Final Fight - The game's first two bosses, Damnd and Sodom, were renamed Thrasher and Katana respectively (those names was also used in the SNES version of Street Fighter Alpha 2 despite the game released after ESRB was formed); Belger's wheelchair was redrawn to look like an office chair; Poison and Roxy, two transgender enemy characters, were replaced with two male enemies named Billy and Sid; all alcoholic references were removed, with two health-recovering items replaced; the line \\"Oh! My God\\", spoken by an enemy when his car is destroyed during the first bonus stage, was changed to \\"Oh! My Car\\"; the blood splash effect shown when a character is stabbed is replaced by a generic explosion. *Mortal Kombat - Due to Nintendo's \\"Family Friendly\\" policy, the SNES version replaced the blood with sweat and most of the fatalities with less violent \\"finishing moves\\". *Street Fighter Alpha 2 - Sodom's name was once again changed to Katana on the character select screen, and some swearing was removed from some of the character's victory quotes. Also the blood was wiped clean from this version in cutscenes. *Super Castlevania IV - Much censorship happened from Japan to international areas. In the Japanese version, the title screen has a drop of blood, there were crosses on gravestones, as well as other objects, and there were nude statues in the game. In the international version, the drop of blood (and most, if not all of the rest of the blood in the game), was removed, or changed. The crosses were removed with the exception of the rosary item. The nude statues were given clothes in the international version. *Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts - In the American SNES version. Many of the Crosses on coffins on Level 1 has been altered to Ankhs symbol. There are however crosses on coffins in the middle and furthest background which remains unaltered. *Super Mario RPG - Bowser's Fist pose was changed for Western releases to be much less offensive, as this is considered a very obscene gesture in Western Territories. Also in the PAL Virtual Console version of Super Mario RPG the word \\"Bugger\\" said by Croco has been replaced with \\"Pest\\", due to \\"Bugger\\" being a vulgar verb for sodomy. *The Combatribes - Changes have been made in the North American version including the bad guys faces bleeding being replaced with tears coming out of their faces. Later on in the Virtual Console release. The \\"Ground Zero\\" gang has been renamed to \\"Guilty Zero\\" due to the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center. *Wing Commander (video game) - In the SNES version of Wing Commander and Wing Commander: The Secret Missions, changes have been made in the game from the PC game including the word \\"Devil team\\" being changed to \\"Angel team\\", also the cigarette smoking, alcohol shown in the PC version has been censored. Also the word \\"Hell\\" used by the Commander is replaced with the word \\"Heck\\". *Zombies Ate My Neighbors - All depictions of blood and gore in the North American version are removed or changed to purple ooze. Censorship committees in several European Nations censored more by having the game renamed to Zombies and made other changes including the replacement of the chainsaw-wielding enemies with lumberjacks wielding axes. *SimAnt - For the SNES release in the US, animations of an ant vomiting were removed. . *Super Street Fighter II - Blood was removed from the continue portraits from the SNES and 3DO console ports in North America. Fifth generation (1993-2001) *Crusin' USA - Many changes were made from the arcade game due to Nintendo's \\"Family Friendly\\" policy, including the name of the Shaft being renamed from \\"XL Power Shaft\\" to \\"XL Power\\", the billboard ad to Corn Pops with the slogan \\"Gotta have my pops\\" being removed. Deer and cows no longer cross the road, eliminating any possibility of running into deer and cows with the blood and body parts flying everywhere. The bikini clad woman with the trophy wears a shirt and dress. In the Washington DC tunnel the 100 dollar bill picture with Hillary Clinton smoking a cigar was replaced with a Benjamin Franklin 100 dollar bill. Also the hot tub scene at the White House with Bill Clinton and the two bikini dressed women in the hot tub was replaced with a rotating race car. *Duke Nukem 3D - Many of the sexual references found in the PC version were either removed or toned down in the Nintendo 64 version, also due to Nintendo's \\"Family Friendly\\" policy. The steroids have also been replaced with vitamins. Also some of the swear words have been either removed or edited as well. *Breath of Fire IV - The scene with Fou-Lu decapitating Emperor Soniel head in the Japanese version has been cut out in the North American version. *Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back - A death animation in which Crash is squashed into a stunned head and feet was altered for the Japanese version of the game due to its resemblance to the severed head and shoes left by a serial killer loose in Japan at the time. *Final Fantasy VII - Some of the profanity used by Cloud, Barrett and Cid has been censored with swearing symbols. Also the word \\"Wench\\" used by Tifa has also been replaced with swearing symbols. *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time - In the boss fights against Ganondorf and Ganon the blood appears green in the English version but is originally red in the Japanese version. *Final Fantasy VIII - In the North American version the boss Gerogero has been recolored from red in the Japanese to blue in the English version, this change also applies to the Triple Trad Gerogero card. *Um Jammer Lammy - A few lines and an entire cutscene were altered for the American release, such as references to cutting down trees in \\"Power off, Power on!\\", and going to hell in \\"Taste of Teriyaki\\". Any references to hell were changed, and instead of slipping on a banana peel (and subsequently dying), Lammy gets her waist stuck on a door, and it stretches very long to sling her to a tropical island. *The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask - Skull Kid's face is covered in black in the Japanese version but appears with a scarecrow face in the English version. This was edited due to its resemblance to blackface similar to the controversy of Pok√©mon's Jynx. In the Japanese version of Majora's Mask 3D, Skull Kid no longer has his face all black. *DreamWeb - Full frontal nudity was censored in the Australian version. *Soul Blade - Sophitia's back was originally naked while bathing in the introduction of the Japanese version of Soul Edge. She is clothed in Soul Blade. *Worms Armageddon (2016 Steam and GoG releases) - These modern, digitally-distributed re-releases are missing some stock team flags and speech banks, which were an integral part of original CD version, presumably as a result of censorship of potentially offensive content and copyright issues, as one of the flags directly depicted Aphex Twin's logo. Missing files can be manually restored from original CD by the user. *Carmageddon - In the United Kingdom, pedestrians were replaced with zombies with green blood, and in Germany they were replaced with robots that did not move. Sixth generation (1998-2008) *Twisted Metal Black - The European version had its first level altered. Originally, the player would have to shoot down a circling Boeing 747 which would crash into a building revealing a secret area. Because this version of the game was released after the September 11 attacks, the level starts with the plane already crashed. Various other elements of the game were also censored for being considered too graphic, including all the game's cutscenes. *Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty - Released two months after the September 11 attacks, a scene where Arsenal Gear destroys the Statue of Liberty and crashes into the Federal Hall National Memorial was removed, as well as live- action footage of the World Trade Center originally meant to appear in the game's ending. * BMX XXX - Only the GameCube and Xbox versions contained nudity. A North American version of the game disables the ability to create naked customized riders. *Grand Theft Auto III - Rampage challenges and the associated pick-ups were removed from the German release of the game due to German censors not wanting to allow people to live out killing spree fantasies. Also for the German release, when a civilian dies or is shot, there is no blood, and they do not drop money in an attempt to limit incentives to \\"kill for points\\". *Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - See Hot Coffee mod. *Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door - Vivian is depicted as female in the English version but is originally male in the Japanese version. This is because of the scene where Vivian kisses Mario. *Indigo Prophecy - Sony and Microsoft had, and still have, policies that they would refuse to allow \\"Adults only\\" (AO) rated games on their respective consoles. To earn a M rating from the ESRB, most of the scenes depicting sex (one of which is interactive) and other adult content were removed from the North American versions. An exception is the final sex scene between Carla and Lucas, which was not completely cut from the game due to its important role in the story, but was shortened by removing the more graphic shots and most of the visible nudity. Though one shot of nudity remains, in the edited version the angle that should have revealed Carla's fully naked breasts, the nipples were removed from her model skin, giving the appearance that the nipples were merely obscured from view, and thus avoiding any identifiable depictions of frontal female nudity. *World of Warcraft - In the European version players are unable to acquire a Wolpertinger pet by completing a quest that requires getting their character drunk. In the Chinese version, blood is black instead of red, and virtually all bone-looking objects are removed or replaced (e.g. no skeletons, sand bags instead of bone piles, undead without exposed bones ... ). Initially, the whole expansion Wrath of the Lich King was banned. *Command and Conquer Generals - Due to the game previously being banned in Germany, EA released a title-localized German version specifically for the German market called \\"Command & Conquer: Gener√§le\\", which did not incorporate real world factions or any relation to terrorism. For example, the \\"terrorist\\" suicide bomber unit was transformed into a rolling bomb and all other infantry units were changed into \\"cyborgs\\" in order of appearance and unit responses similar to earlier releases of the Command & Conquer franchise. *Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix - In Germany, humans were replaced by robots, and blood was replaced by oil. Seventh generation (2004-2013) Some titles in the PlayStation 3 library have been censored according to the console hardware, resulting in consoles from certain regions directly altering game content, regardless of the region in which the game was produced. *Beyond: Two Souls - The European version of the game is censored to keep the PEGI rating at 16 instead of 18. Two changes were made to the version, amounting to 5‚Äì10 seconds of gameplay. *Grand Theft Auto V - The Japanese and Korean versions are known for removing or heavily modifying anything and all related to sex and nudity in the game out of fear and concern for the \\"morality\\" of its citizens (although this applied to the console versions, not the PC version). *The Last of Us - The European release of the game is censored. The version doesn't feature dismemberment and exploding heads in the multiplayer mode. The Japanese version is also censored, as dismemberment is not possible. A scene where Ellie is imprisoned and witnesses a man cutting a corpse was also censored, specifically the camera's position doesn't show the corpse. *Little Big Planet - In the later copies of the game the lyric song \\"Tapha Niang\\" has been replaced with the instrumental version due to quotes from the Qur'an mixed with music. *Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe - In order to ensure a T rating in North America, two Fatalities in the game were censored. In the United Kingdom version, both the Joker and Deathstroke's first Fatality feature them each finishing their opponent with a gunshot to the head, with each respective shot shown uncut from a distance. However, the North American version has the camera quickly pan toward the victor before the shot is fired, thereby cutting the victim out of the shot completely. *Resistance: Fall of Man - Blood is removed from the game when played on Japanese consoles. Players can work around this by using an altered save file or copying save data from a North American console. *Siren: Blood Curse - The North American version of this game was heavily censored to receive \\"Mature\\" ESRB rating. An extremely violent stabbing scene in the intro is omitted in U.S. version, by the way of applying shaky camera motion filters and altering the video angle itself. A scene where Seigo Saiga commits suicide by placing a .338 caliber hunting rifle in his mouth and blowing his head and brains out. Characters and enemies show a significantly lower amount of blood splatter decals on skin, clothes, and face. *Uncharted: Drake's Fortune - Blood is removed from the game when played on a Japanese region PS3. *Mario Party 8 - In the UK version of Mario Party 8. the word \\"Spastic\\" was changed to \\"Erratic\\" in later PAL copies due to \\"Spastic\\" being an offensive word relating to Cerebral Palsy. *Metroid Prime 3: Corruption - In the Metroid Prime Trilogy edition, the word \\"Damn\\" said by Admiral Dane was replaced with \\"No\\". *No More Heroes - In the versions released in PAL territories and Japan, blood spatter is removed and were replaced with a black dust. Decapitation scenes are implied, but not shown. Scenes of missing body parts after having been cut off, are replaced with the same scene, but showing the body parts fully intact. *No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle - Like No More Heroes, the Japanese version is toned down violence scenes. *Fallout 3 - The side-quest \\"The Power of the Atom\\" was changed in the Japanese version to relieve concerns about depictions of atomic detonation in inhabited areas. In other versions, players are given the option of either defusing, ignoring, or detonating the dormant atomic bomb in the town of Megaton. In the Japanese version, the character Mr. Burke has been taken out of this side quest, making it impossible to detonate the bomb. Also in the Japanese release, the \\"Fat Man\\" nuclear catapult weapon was renamed \\"Nuka Launcher\\", as the original name was a reference to the bomb used on Nagasaki. *Silent Hill Homecoming - The game had difficulties in passing censors in some countries before it could go on sale. The Australian classification board, then the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC), refused to classify the game, due to \\"impact violence and excessive blood effects\\". The objectionable scenes included various body parts being drilled into, as well as the bisection of a character by an enemy. This had the effect of banning the game for sale in the country, and representatives for publisher Atari mentioned that they would be asking Konami to tone down the violence to allow the game to receive the needed MA15+ rating for its sale to be permitted in early 2009. The German version of the game was also postponed to 2009 in order for cuts to be made to pass the German censors. *Saints Row IV - The Australian version of the game has had a mission removed in which characters steal and use alien drugs in order to give them stronger physical abilities. Portraying the use of illegal substances as a way to gain rewards is not permitted according to Australia's classification guidelines. *South Park: The Stick of Truth - The European version has all five references to anal probing removed. An abortion minigame was also cut. Ubisoft claimed that it was their decision to censor it. In the German release swastikas were covered with black boxes on Nazi zombies. *Left 4 Dead 2 - In Australia, the game was originally banned due to the high levels of violence in the gameplay. Valve then submitted a 'censored' version of the game, which no longer contained images of \\"decapitation, dismemberment, wound detail or piles of dead bodies\\". The game received the MA15+ rating (the highest possible rating at the time in Australia), and was allowed to be released in the Australian Market. The German version is similarly censored. *The Witcher - All the female portrait cards shown after Geralt's \\"sexual conquests\\" were censored (\\"retouched to a more modest standard\\") for the U.S. release version. *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 - The controversial \\"No Russian\\" level was removed from the Russian version. *Gal*Gun - Publishers Inti-Creates was forced by Microsoft to censor the Xbox 360 version due to players being able to look up the girls' skirts, while the PlayStation 3 version remained completely uncensored. *Football Manager 2005 - China's Ministry of Culture stated that Tibet being listed as a separate country in the game would \\"pose harm to the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity\\" so the Chinese release saw Tibet merged into China. Eighth generation (2011-present) *Fire Emblem Awakening - Tharja's swimsuit scene in the Summer Scramble Story has her behind covered by a curtain in the changing room. This curtain does not appear in the Japanese and PAL version. *The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Violence and gore was reduced, and nudity was cut from the game's release in both Japan and the Middle East. *Until Dawn - A death scene was censored in the Japanese version of the game. *Monster Monpiece - About 40 of the 350 card images in the game were censored for sexually explicit material in the international PlayStation Vita release of the game. An uncensored port was later announced to be released on Steam for PC in 2016. *Fire Emblem Fates - A controversial scene showing what could be perceived as gay conversion therapy was edited in the international release of the game to remove references to the act. In addition, a feature that allowed players to \\"pet\\" a chosen characters face was removed. *Omega Labyrinth Z - Release outside of Japan was blocked by Sony. *Senran Kagura Burst Re:Newal - One of the game's modes \\"Intimacy Mode\\" was forced to be removed for the PS4 release of the game outside of Japan by Sony. Steam release was not changed. *Nekopara - The PS4 release is censored by Sony's decision due to its sexual content. As a result, the PS4 version received an \\"E\\" rating by the ESRB by comparison to how the game received an \\"M\\" rating on the Nintendo Switch. *Date a Live: Rio Reincarnation - The PS4 release has certain event scenes altered and removal of illustrations that show the girls in suggestive positions. The game's PC release was not changed. *Super Neptunia RPG - Two illustrations were altered in the PS4 release. The first is of Vert playing her games and has the image zoomed in a little to cover her panties; Vert's panties are shown in versions for Nintendo Switch and Steam. The second is of the hot spring event where the PS4 version has more smoke. *Aokana: Four Rhythms Across the Blue - The PS4 release was limited to digital-only due to changes related to seven scenes within the game and \\"significantly less interest\\" expected in a physical version as a result,https://twitter.com/PQubeGames/status/1273548307676135425 four scenes which have been modified and three which have been removed completely, while the Nintendo Switch release received no changes to content or choice between physical and digital versions.https://www.gematsu.com/2020/06/aokana-four-rhythms-across-the-blue- for-ps4-has-four-modified-scenes-three-removed-scenes-in-the-west= The Nintendo Switch release launched on schedule,https://twitter.com/PQubeGames/status/1296764626030473229 whereas the PS4 release has been delayed to an as of yet undetermined date.

Background and earlier life L√∫der was born in Rafaela, Santa Fe Province. He enrolled at his province's National University of the Littoral, where he received a juris doctor in 1938. L√∫der was first elected to a seat in the Constitutional Convention of 1948, which drafted president Juan Per√≥n's 1949 replacement of the 1853 Constitution of Argentina. Following Per√≥n's 1955 overthrow, however, the original document was reinstated, and the exiled Per√≥n entrusted L√∫der with his legal defense in absentia vis-√°-vis extensive corruption charges. L√∫der was elected to the Argentine Senate as a Peronist for Santa Fe Province in 1973. Upon the resignation of Senate President Alejandro D√≠az Bialet in July, L√∫der was elected to that post. Following President Juan Per√≥n's 1974 death, Isabel Per√≥n became head of state, though by September 1975, mounting instability led her to announce a month's sick leave. Acting President of Argentina Lacking a Vice President, the post of acting President of Argentina fell to L√∫der, whose brief tenure would later be remembered chiefly for his signing of Decrees 2770-2772, which created a \\"Council for Internal Security\\", in response to Operation Primicia, a guerrilla attack carried out by Montoneros on a military barracks at Formosa Province. The measure, combined with prior ones, was successful in quelling an insurgent campaign led by the leftist ERP in Tucum√°n Province, though it in practice extended a state of siege nationwide. Later Peronist leadership and other roles L√∫der was nominated candidate for president for the Justicialist Party during the 1983 elections that resulted in the return of democracy following nearly eight years of dictatorship. The strong support of his candidacy by the CGT labor union could not compensate, however, for the Peronists' late start (the nomination was secured less than two months before election day), the rival UCR nominee Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n's skillful campaign, or voters' bitter memories of Isabel Per√≥n's chaotic tenure, among other problems. L√∫der was defeated on election night by around 12%. He was appointed Defense Secretary by newly elected President Carlos Menem in 1989, but a cabinet shake-up on the heels of a crisis at the end of the year led to his replacement, whereby L√∫der was named Ambassador to France. √çtalo L√∫der died from complications of Alzheimer's disease at the age of 91, on May 25, 2008, in Buenos Aires.

A possible mechanism for this observation is that the sequence variation influences secondary structures in the 3' UTR. Interfering with GRIK4/KA1 function with a specific anti-KA1 antibody protects against kainate-induced neuronal cell death. A test of that gene can be made in order to know if a depressed patient will respond to the SSRI citalopram.  Evolutionary significance  The GRIK4 gene displayed significantly higher rates of evolution in primates than in rodents and especially in the lineage leading from primates to humans. Furthermore, the GRIK4 gene is implicated in the development of the nervous system. Hence evolution of the GRIK4 gene is thought to have played a role in the dramatic increases in size and complexity of the brain that occurred during evolutionary history leading to humans.

Vincent and written by P. V. Thampi based on his novel Krishna Parunthu. The film stars Mohanlal, Balan K. Nair, Jagathy Sreekumar, Pavithra, and Bindu. The story is about Kumaran, a complete rogue, who turns out to be a pious saint and the temptations he has to suffer. The music for the film was composed by K. Raghavan. The film was a major commercial success of that year at Mollywood box office.  Plot  Puthoor Illam is a traditional family that practices positive tantric magic under blessings of their family god, Lord Garuda, popularly known as Sri Krishnaparunthu (The Eagle of Krishna) and Hanuman. The family is widely respected for their ability to revive near-dead people due to venomous snake bites using the sacred water through invoking Garuda. Pappu (Jagannatha Varma), who is the current magician of the family, foresees his death and decides to transfer all his knowledge to his nephew Kumaran Thampi (Mohanlal). Kumaran, whose only interest is wine and women reluctantly accepts the decision, as the magician must vow to maintain extreme celibacy. Pappu transfers all his knowledge to Kumaran and dies. Thus Kumaran becomes the next magician of the locality famous for curing snake bites and warding off evil spirits. One night Kumaran goes to his ancestral palace for collecting manuscripts on traditional magic. On his return, he encounters the ghost of Lakshmikutty, who tries to attract Kumaran. Lakshmikutty died of a snake bite while having sexual intercourse with Kumaran earlier. Using his magical powers, Kumaran gains control over the ghost. Lakshmikutty vows to Kumaran that she will not disturb him till he keeps his Brahmacharya. Choorakkattu Bhattathiri is a local black magician who wants to gain supremacy on the locality by destroying the magical powers of Kumaran and he worships Vada-yakshi, who resides in the Banyan tree along with demoness Dhuma. From ghosts to women, he tries everything to do it, but Kumaran escapes with his powers. Meanwhile, Kumaran gets attracted towards Bhanumathi (Pavithra), who starts to disturb him in his dreams. Soon Kumaran loses control over his emotions and breaks his Brahmacharya by having sex with Meenakshi, a local prostitute. Here starts the deterioration of Kumaran's magical powers. The ghost of Lakshmikutty returns, since Kumaran has breached his brahmacharya. Again using his magical powers, Kumaran convinces her and keeps her locked inside his outbuilding. As he broke his celibacy vows, he can't invoke Garuda anymore and loses much of his magical powers. Kumaran starts to perform black magic for making money, since he is not able to concentrate. Choorakkattu Bhattathiri uses Vada Yakshi and Dhuma Demoness to kill all relatives of Kumaran. While Garuda saved the pious mother of Kumaran from Vada Yakshi, Dhuma was successful in burning the niece of Kumaran. However the nephew was saved, as he was wearing the magical amulet. Soon he marries Bhanumathi, which makes his mother leave his home. On the day before his marriage, Kumaran gets attracted to the persuasions from Lakshmikutty and gets trapped by having sexual intercourse with her. Lakshmikutty curses Kumaran that he will not be able to have sex with any other women. Due to this, Kumaran tries to avoid sexual intercourse with Bhanumathi, which evokes doubts on her. Later, she finds the relationship between Kumaran and Lakshmikutty. One night, she enters the outbuilding by breaking the magical barriers, mistaking Lakshmikutty as a normal woman. The ghost of Lakshmikutty enters the body of Bhanumathi and starts to disturb Kumaran. An attempt by Kumaran to destroy the ghost leads to the suicide of Bhanumathi. A desperate Kumaran decides to stop worshipping Lord Garuda and the family goddess completely and becomes the disciple of his relative Kunjambu (Balan K. Nair), another black magician, and Kumaran begins worshipping Varthali, the negative spirit of the boar-headed Goddess Varahi. Then with the help of black magic powers, Kumaran becomes successful in destroying his enemies; Lakshmikutty as well as Choorakkattu Bhattathiri. Choorakkattu Bhattathiri becomes a lunatic. Later, Kumaran hears that his relatives are planning to secure the manuscripts from his ancestral palace. The greedy Kumaran rushes to the palace forgetting the warning from Kunajambu, that as a devotee of Varthali, he forfeits his right to worship all other Devas, including Garuda. As soon as he enters the palace, Garuda appears and attacks him. Meanwhile, when he tries to take the holy manuscripts, the protecting Goddess appears in front of him. He tries to counter with help of Varthali, but in front of the all powerful goddess, Varthali disappears. The goddess curses him and using her power, sets the palace on fire. Kumaran, who suffers severe intense burns and severe deadly blows from Garuda escapes out of the burning palace. The movie ends with the Kumaran breathing his last after transferring his knowledge to his nephew as per the tradition.

In the Catholic Church, the first five stanzas are used at Matins during Passiontide in the Divine Office, with the remaining stanzas (beginning with Lustra sex) sung at Lauds. Both parts are chanted during the Adoration of the Cross on Good Friday. This hymn later inspired Thomas Aquinas to write the hymn \\"Pange lingua gloriosi corporis mysterium\\" for the Feast of Corpus Christi. The hymn is later incorporated into Gustav Holst's The Hymn of Jesus. Latin text A 10th century manuscript Pange, lingua, gloriosi proelium certaminis et super crucis trophaeo dic triumphum nobilem, qualiter redemptor orbis immolatus vicerit. De parentis protoplasti fraude factor condolens, quando pomi noxialis morte morsu corruit, ipse lignum tunc notavit, damna ligni ut solveret. Hoc opus nostrae salutis ordo depoposcerat, multiformis perditoris arte ut artem falleret et medelam ferret inde, hostis unde laeserat. Quando venit ergo sacri plenitudo temporis, missus est ab arce patris natus orbis conditor atque ventre virginali carne factus prodiit. Vagit infans inter arta conditus praesaepia, membra pannis involuta virgo mater adligat, et pedes manusque crura stricta pingit fascia. Lustra sex qui iam peracta tempus implens corporis, se volente, natus ad hoc, passioni deditus, agnus in crucis levatur immolandus stipite. Hic acetum, fel, arundo, sputa, clavi, lancea; mite corpus perforatur; sanguis, unda profluit, terra pontus astra mundus quo lavantur flumine. Crux fidelis, inter omnes arbor una nobilis, nulla talem silva profert flore, fronde, germine, dulce lignum dulce clavo dulce pondus sustinens. Flecte ramos, arbor alta, tensa laxa viscera, et rigor lentescat ille quem dedit nativitas, ut superni membra regis mite tendas stipite. Sola digna tu fuisti ferre pretium saeculi atque portum praeparare nauta mundo naufrago, quem sacer cruor perunxit fusus agni corpore. English translation English translation of five verses by John Mason Neale: Sing, my tongue, the glorious battle; Sing the ending of the fray. Now above the cross, the trophy, Sound the loud triumphant lay: Tell how Christ, the world's redeemer, As a victim won the day. Tell how, when at length the fullness Of the appointed time was come, He, the Word, was born of woman, Left for us His Father's home, Blazed the path of true obedience, Shone as light amidst the gloom. Thus, with thirty years accomplished, He went forth from Nazareth, Destined, dedicated, willing, Did His work, and met His death; Like a lamb He humbly yielded On the cross His dying breath. Faithful cross, true sign of triumph, Be for all the noblest tree; None in foliage, none in blossom, None in fruit thine equal be; Symbol of the world's redemption, For the weight that hung on thee! Unto God be praise and glory: To the Father and the Son, To the eternal Spirit honor Now and evermore be done; Praise and glory in the highest, While the timeless ages run. The hymn is often sung in English with either the original Mode III tune or the tune FORTUNATUS NEW. The hymn was also loosely adapted into English as 'Praise the Savior' by the nineteenth-century Swedish minister Johan Wallin and set to the tune UPP, MIN TUNGA.

For example, many window managers allow the screen background to be specified as a gradient. The colors produced by a gradient vary continuously with position, producing smooth color transitions. A color gradient is also known as a color ramp or a color progression. In assigning colors to a set of values, a gradient is a continuous colormap, a type of color scheme. Definitions * Color gradient is a set of colors arranged in a linear order ( ordered) * A continuous colormap is a curve through a colorspace Linear Gradients in \\"SVG 1.1 (Second Edition)\\", W3C Recommendation, August 2011 =Radial gradients= A radial color gradient A radial gradient is specified as a circle that has one color at the edge and another at the center.

Example conic gradients include pie charts and color wheels.mozilla docs: CSS conic-gradient =Other shapes= In vector graphics polygon meshes can be used, e.g., Adobe Illustrator supported gradient meshes. Effect of color space The appearance of a gradient not only varies by the color themselves, but also by the color space the calculation is performed in. The problem usually becomes important for two reasons: * Gamma correction to a color space. With a typical Œ≥ of around 2, it is easy to see that a gamma-enabled color space will blend darker than a linear-intensity color space, since the sum of squares of two numbers is never more than the square of their sum. The effect is most apparent in blending complementary colors like red and green, with the middle color being a dark color instead of the expected yellow. * Handling of other perceptual properties. In information visualization, it is undesirable to have a supposedly \\"flat\\" gradient show non-monotonic variations in lightness and saturation along the way.

He played hurling at various times with his local clubs Dicksboro and Garda. Power was also a member of the Kilkenny and Dublin senior inter-county team in the 1920s and 1930s. Biography Matty Power was born in Graiguenamanagh, County Kilkenny in 1899. He was educated locally and later trained as a member of the Garda S√≠och√°na before moving to Dublin where he worked as a guard. Together with his wife, Nancy Walsh (1916‚Äì2003), they also ran a boarding house at Gardiner Place called Kilkenny House. Matty Power died from lung cancer in 1965. Playing careerClub= Power played his club hurling with his local Dicksboro club just outside Kilkenny. He won a senior county title with the club in 1923. Power later moved to Dublin where he played with the famous Garda club in the city. Here he collected five senior county titles in-a-row from 1925 until 1929. Power won a seventh county title in 1931. =Inter-county= Power first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Kilkenny senior inter-county team in the early 1920s. He won his first Leinster title in 1922 following an eight-point victory over Dublin. This victory allowed Kilkenny to advance to the All-Ireland final where Tipperary were the opponents. With three minutes left in the game Tipp were leading by three points, however, last-minute goals by Paddy Donoghue and Dick Tobin secured a 4-2 to 2-6 victory for Kilkenny. Power had captured his first All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship medal. He added a second Leinster title to his collection in 1923 following another win over Dublin, however, Galway accounted for Power‚Äôs side in the All-Ireland semi-final. After moving to Dublin, Power was allowed to turn out for the Dublin senior hurling team. He won a third Leinster title in 1927 as Dublin defeated his own native-county on a score line of 7-7 to 4-6. In the subsequent All-Ireland final, Dublin faced Cork, the reigning All-Ireland champions. On a team composed of nine members of An Garda S√≠och√°na Dublin were in the lead at half- time, and Power collected his second All-Ireland medal as his side won by 4-8 to 1-3. In 1928, Power added a fourth provincial medal to his collection as Dublin defeated Offaly by 9-7 to 4-3. The subsequent All-Ireland semi-final saw the Leinster and Munster champions come face-to-face as Dublin took on Cork in a repeat of the previous All-Ireland final. On this occasion Cork defeated Power‚Äôs side by 5- to 0-2. In 1929, Power collected a National Hurling League title with Dublin. Dublin were later defeated by Kilkenny in the Leinster final. The team bounced back in 1930 and defeated Laois by 5-7 to 2-2 giving Power a fifth Leinster title and passage to the All-Ireland final. Dublin faced Tipperary on that occasion, however, Power ended up on the losing side that day. In 1931 Power availed of the newly introduced non-resident rule and declared for his own native-county of Kilkenny. That year he won a sixth Leinster title following a narrow win for Kilkenny over Laois. A defeat of Galway in the penultimate stage of the championship set up a championship decider with Cork. On that occasion both sides finished level on a score line of 1-6 apiece. One month later both teams returned to Croke Park to participate in the replay. Once again Cork took the lead at half-time, however, Kilkenny fought back, and both sides again finished level with 2-5 each. On 1 November, Cork and Kilkenny returned to Croke Park for the third time. Cork went on to win the game by 5-8 to 3-4. In 1932, Kilkenny were back and Power collected a seventh Leinster title following a victory over Dublin. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Power's side take on Clare. It was the first ever meeting of these two teams in the history of the championship. In a close match, Kilkenny took the lead thanks to goals by Power, Lory Meagher and Martin White. Clare fought back, however, Kilkenny hung on to win the game by 3-3 to 2-3 giving Power a third All-Ireland medal. Kilkenny retained their provincial dominance in 1933 with a defeat of Dublin giving Power an eighth Leinster medal. A defeat of Galway in the next game set up an All-Ireland final meeting with Limerick. In another tight game Kilkenny sealed the victory with a 1-7 to 0-6 score line giving Power his fourth All-Ireland title, Kilkenny lost their provincial title in 1934, however, Power won a ninth Leinster medal in 1935. The All-Ireland final saw Kilkenny take on Limerick for the second time in three years. Once again the match was a close one, however, Kilkenny clung on and won by a single point ‚Äì 2-5 to 2-4. It was Power's fifth victory in an All-Ireland final. At this he was thirty-six years old and most players would contemplate retirement. Power, however, decided to play on, a decision which paid off in 1936 as he collected a tenth Leinster title before lining out in yet another All-Ireland final. Kilkenny and Limerick were paired together in the championship decider. Limerick won on a score line of 5-6 to 1-5. Power remained on the team and collected an eleventh Leinster title in 1937. The All-Ireland final saw Kilkenny take on Tipperary, however, Kilkenny were heavily defeated by 3-11 to 0-3. Following this defeat Power decided to retire from inter-county hurling. =Province= Power also lined out with Leinster in the inter-provincial hurling competition. He won his first Railway Cup medal in 1927 as Leinster defeated Munster in the inaugural year of the competition. Power‚Äôs side were defeated by Munster for the next four years, however, he added another two Railway Cup medals to his collection in 1932 and 1933. He won a fourth and final title in 1936.

The \\"Moriones\\" are men and women in costumes and masks replicating the garb of biblical Roman soldiers as interpreted by local folks. The Moriones or Moryonan tradition has inspired the creation of other festivals in the Philippines where cultural practices or folk history is turned into street festivals.MARINDUQUE'S THRUST FOR CULTURAL & TOURISM DEVELOPMENT It is a colorful festival celebrated on the island of Marinduque in the Philippines. The participants use morion masks to depict the Roman soldiers and Syrian mercenaries within the story of the Passion of the Christ. The mask was named after the 16th and 17th century Morion helmet. The Moriones refers to the masked and costumed penitents who march around the town for seven days searching for Longinus. Morions roam the streets in town from Holy Monday to Easter Sunday scaring the kids, or engaging in antics or surprises to draw attention. This is a folk-religious festival that re-enacts the story of Saint Longinus, a Roman centurion who was blind in one eye. The festival is characterized by colorful Roman costumes, painted masks and helmets, and brightly colored tunics. The towns of Boac, Gasan, Santa Cruz, Buenavista and Mogpog in the island of Marinduque become one gigantic stage. The observances form part of the Lenten celebrations of Marinduque. The various towns also hold the unique tradition of the pabasa or the recitation of Christ's passion in verse.One of the Philippines most Colorful Festivals Then at three o'clock on Good Friday afternoon, the Santo Sepulcro is observed, whereby old women exchange verses based on the Bible as they stand in wake of the dead Christ. One of the highlights of this festival is the Via Crucis. A re-enactment of the suffering of Christ on his way to the calvary. Men inflict suffering upon themselves by whipping their backs, carrying a wooden cross and sometimes even crucifixion. They see this act as their form of atonement for their sins. This weeklong celebration starts on Holy Monday and ends on Easter Sunday. Moriones Festival-Marinduque Background The term Moriones was concocted by the media in the 1960s, but local inhabitants have kept the original term Moryonan. Many practitioners are farmers and fishermen that engage in this age-old tradition as a vow of penance or thanksgiving. Legend has it that Longinus pierced the side of the crucified Christ. The blood that spurted forth touched his blind eye and fully restored his sight. This miracle converted Longinus to Christianity and earned the ire of his fellow centurions. The re-enactment reaches its climax when Longinus is caught and beheaded. History In Valencia, Spain there is a similar celebration called Festival de Moros y Cristianos (Moors and Christians Festival). It is almost certain that the word Moriones was derived from Moros. Another possible derivation is from the Spanish word \\"muri√≥\\" (root verb:morir) meaning \\"(3rd person singular) died\\". The origin of the festival is traced to Mogpog and the year 1887 when Dionisio Santiago, the parish priest of said town, organized it for the first time.The Moriones Festival of Marinduque See also *Holy Week in the Philippines External links *UnOfficial Marinduque Tourism Website *Youtube-Moriones Festival *Youtube-Moriones Festival 2 *Youtube-via crusis at Moriones *360 panoramas of Moriones Festival References Category:Festivals in the Philippines Category:Culture of Marinduque Category:Tourist attractions in Marinduque ","title":"Moriones Festival"},{"id":"18004404","text":"Piz Blas is a mountain in the Lepontine Alps, located on the border between the cantons of Graub√ºnden and Ticino.

Rosenow missed out on playing in Geelong's 1963 premiership team despite appearing in most of their home and away fixtures but played in their losing 1967 Grand Final. He became a regular member of the side towards the end of his career and from 1965 until late in the 1970 VFL season Rosenow played exactly 100 consecutive games. He ran out as Geelong captain versus Fitzroy in the first match at Waverley Park in 1970 as it was his 100th game. Rosenow was used mostly as a ruckman and defender. He was a strong marker of the ball and did not shy away from physical confrontation, as demonstrated by a famous incident in 1964. The incident occurred in a game against North Melbourne at Kardinia Park when he allegedly 'king-hit' North Melbourne coach Alan Killigrew in the players race which caused a brawl. No charges were laid against him.Stevens, M. \\"Killigrew football's hot gospeller\\", Football Record, 31 May 2013, p. 70. After leaving Geelong Rosenow became playing coach of the Wangaratta Football Club and won their best and fairest award in 1973. He joined Victorian Football Association (VFA) club Mordialloc in 1975 as captain-coach, steering them to the second division premiership two years later. He served in that role from 1975 until 1978. In 1979, Rosenow was appointed playing coach of GVFL club Rochester. In 1980 he took the team to its first GVFL finals campaign where it was dismissed in \\"straight sets\\". He continued coaching Rochester until 1982. Rosenow returned to Mordialloc as coach from 1983 until 1984. In 1984, Rosenow coached the VFA Division 2 team in a win against the SAFA. He was named captain of the Mordialloc Team of the Century and positioned in the back pocket. Rosenow returned to Rochester in 1987, and the team played finals in 1988 but was again knocked out in straight sets. A police officer, Rosenow died in 1999 and was posthumously inducted into the Victoria Police sporting hall of fame. References *Holmesby, Russell and Main, Jim (2007).

Born in Duniry, County Galway, Power first arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty-two when he first linked up with the Galway senior team, before later lining out with the junior side. He made his senior debut in the 1918 championship. Power went on to enjoy a ten-year inter-county career, and won one All-Ireland medal and one Connacht medal. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions. Power represented the Connacht inter-provincial team on one occasion, however, he ended his career without a Railway Cup medals. At club level he won five championship medals with Tynagh. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1928 championship. Power is the longest-lived All-Ireland medallist. Playing careerClub= Power played his club hurling with Tynagh and enjoyed much success during a lengthy career. After losing back-to-back championship deciders in 1918 and 1919, Tynagh qualified for a third successive county final in 1920. A defeat of Kilconieron gave Power his first championship. medal. After the suspension of the championship the following year, Tynagh reached the county decider once again in 1922. Galway City were defeated on that occasion with Power winning a second championship medal. Tynagh made it two-in-a-row in 1923 with Power adding a third medal to his collection following a defeat of Ardrahan. Once again the championship was suspended in 1924, however, Tynagh continued their dominance on its resumption by reaching the county final again in 1925. Craughwell were defeated on this occasion as Power won his fourth championship medal. After two years of no championship activity, Tynagh defeated Peterswell in the championship decider of 1928. It was Power's fifth and final championship medal. =Inter-county= Power first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Galway senior team in 1918. He enjoyed little success in his first few years on the team, however, Galway captured the Connacht title in 1922 and gave a good account of themselves in a narrow defeat by Tipperary in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final. In 1923 Galway qualified for their first All-Ireland final in thirty-six years. After beating reigning champions Kilkenny at the penultimate stage, Galway now faced Limerick who were bidding for a third All- Ireland title in seven years. A high-scoring game developed, however, at half- time the sides were level. A hat-trick of goals by Leonard McGrath and powerful displays by Mick Gill and Mick Derivan helped Galway to a 7-3 to 4-5 victory. It was a first All-Ireland medal for Power. Power was a key member of the team again in 1924 as Galway reached a second successive All-Ireland decider with Dublin providing the opposition. Galway played with the wind in the first-half and led by three points at the break. Two goals by Dublin forward Garrett Howard and a great goalkeeping display by Tommy Daly ensured a 5-3 to 2-6 defeat for Galway. Kenny retired from inter-county hurling following this defeat. After a number of years off the team Power returned in 1928, this time as captain of the team. Galway received a bye straight into the All-Ireland final with Cork providing the opposition. The westerners were completely overwhelmed with Mick \\"Gah\\" Ahern running riot and scoring 5-4. Power's side could only muster a single score during the hour and were eventually trounced by 6-12 to 1-0. After taking umbrage at the physical treatment of Mick King by some of the Cork players, Power threw his hurley onto the ground at the full-time whistle and decided to retire from hurling.

The relevant variable is the membrane potential, x(t), which is written in dimensionless units. There are two more variables, y(t) and z(t), which take into account the transport of ions across the membrane through the ion channels. The transport of sodium and potassium ions is made through fast ion channels and its rate is measured by y(t), which is called the spiking variable. z(t) corresponds to an adaptation current, which is incremented at every spike, leading to a decrease in the firing rate. Then, the Hindmarsh‚ÄìRose model has the mathematical form of a system of three nonlinear ordinary differential equations on the dimensionless dynamical variables x(t), y(t), and z(t). They read: Simulation of Hindmarsh‚ÄìRose neuron showing typical neuronal bursting. : \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{d x}{d t} &= y+\\\\phi(x)-z+I,  \\\\frac{d y}{d t} &= \\\\psi(x)-y,  \\\\frac{d z}{d t} &= r[s(x-x_R)-z], \\\\end{align} where : \\\\begin{align} \\\\phi(x) &= -a x^3+b x^2,  \\\\psi(x) &= c-d x^2. \\\\end{align} The model has eight parameters: a, b, c, d, r, s, xR and I. It is common to fix some of them and let the others be control parameters. Usually the parameter I, which means the current that enters the neuron, is taken as a control parameter. Other control parameters used often in the literature are a, b, c, d, or r, the first four modeling the working of the fast ion channels and the last one the slow ion channels, respectively. Frequently, the parameters held fixed are s = 4 and xR = -8/5. When a, b, c, d are fixed the values given are a = 1, b = 3, c = 1, and d = 5. The parameter r governs the time scale of the neural adaptation and is something of the order of 10‚àí3, and I ranges between ‚àí10 and 10. The third state equation: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{d z}{d t} &= r[s(x-x_R)-z], \\\\end{align} allows a great variety of dynamic behaviors of the membrane potential, described by variable x, including unpredictable behavior, which is referred to as chaotic dynamics. This makes the Hindmarsh‚ÄìRose model relatively simple and provides a good qualitative description of the many different patterns that are observed empirically.

He and his wife Maisie Ward were famous in their day as the names behind the imprint Sheed & Ward and as forceful public lecturers in the Catholic Evidence Guild. Life and careerEarly life= Sheed was born in Sydney on 20 March 1897 to John Sheed, a descendant of Scottish Presbyterians, and English-born Mary Maloney. His mother's family were Irish Catholic. Baptized Catholic, at the insistence of their father, Frank Sheed and his brother Jack were raised Protestant. Frank would attend the Methodist Church, and surreptitiously make his Catholic First Communion and Confirmation. He attended Sydney Boys‚Äô High School and in 1917 obtained a BA degree from the University of Sydney. =Catholic Evidence Guild= In 1920, Sheed travelled to London, where he encountered the Catholic Evidence Guild whose lay Catholics expounded the faith. He joined the group and became an effective soapbox orator. With an understanding of Protestant attitudes toward Catholicism, Sheed took up writing and speaking on the subject of Catholic apologetics, the rational defense of the Catholic faith. Through his activity with the Guild he met Maisie Ward, daughter of Wilfrid Ward, a prominent Catholic essayist and biographer. Sheed & Ward Sheed and Maisie Ward were married in April 1926. That same year, they moved to London, where Sheed and Maisie's brother Leo established the publishing house of Sheed and Ward. When Leo Ward left to become a priest, Maisie took his place as publisher. Their son Wilfred Sheed was an essayist and novelist; their daughter, Rosemary, a translator. As publisher of an all-star roster including Karl Adam, G. K. Chesterton, Hilaire Belloc, Evelyn Waugh, Christopher Dawson, Ronald Knox, and Hugh Pope, Sheed maintained a robust Catholic faith while keeping abreast of progressive trends. Frank Sheed wrote a constant stream of books touching on almost every aspect of basic theology, several of which remain in print. His translation of St. Augustine's Confessions remains acclaimed. In 1933 they opened a branch in New York and became \\"the most influential Catholic publishers in the English-speaking world\\". In 1956 Lille Catholic University awarded him a doctorate in divinity. They sold the firm in 1973. He published an autobiography, The Church and I (1974). Frank Sheed died on 20 November 1981 at Jersey City and was buried in the Holy Name cemetery.

In 1979, a cash strapped West Somerset Railway Company, which had loaned much of the finance for the original purchase required repayment thereby forcing the sale of 5542 and 5521. Members of the Dean Forest Railway bought 5521 and a Taunton-based group of active W.S.R. supporters formed the 5542 Fund to save and restore it for use on the West Somerset Railway. Subsequently, a limited company was formed with an authorised share capital of ¬£100,000, there are 50 voting shares and 150 non- voting shares. Only one voting share is allowed per shareholder.

Indigenous rights are those rights that exist in recognition of the specific condition of the indigenous peoples. This includes not only the most basic human rights of physical survival and integrity, but also the rights over their land (including native title), language, religion, and other elements of cultural heritage that are a part of their existence and identity as a people. This can be used as an expression for advocacy of social organizations, or form a part of the national law in establishing the relation between a government and the right of self-determination among its indigenous people, or in international law as a protection against violation of indigenous rights by actions of governments or groups of private interests.  Definition and historical background  Indigenous rights belong to those who, being indigenous peoples, are defined by being the original people of a land that has been conquered and colonized by outsiders. Exactly who is a part of the indigenous peoples is disputed, but can broadly be understood in relation to colonialism. When we speak of indigenous peoples we speak of those pre- colonial societies that face a specific threat from this phenomenon of occupation, and the relation that these societies have with the colonial powers. The exact definition of who are the indigenous people, and the consequent state of rightsholders, varies. Being too inclusive is considered as bad as being non-inclusive. In the context of modern indigenous people of European colonial powers, the recognition of indigenous rights can be traced to at least the period of Renaissance. Along with the justification of colonialism with a higher purpose for both the colonists and colonized, some voices expressed concern over the way indigenous peoples were treated and the effect it had on their societies. In the Spanish Empire, the crown established the General Indian Court in Mexico and in Peru, with jurisdiction over cases involving the indigenous and aimed at protecting Indians from ill-treatment. Indians' access to the court was enabled by a small tax which paid for legal aides.Woodrow Borah, The General Indian Court of Mexico and the Legal Aides of the Half-Real. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press 1983.Woodrow Borah, \\"Juzgado General de Indios del Per√∫ o juzgado particular de indios de El Cercado de Lima.\\" Revista chilena de historia del derecho, no. 6 (1970): 129-142. The issue of indigenous rights is also associated with other levels of human struggle. Due to the close relationship between indigenous peoples' cultural and economic situations and their environmental settings, indigenous rights issues are linked with concerns over environmental change and sustainable development. According to scientists and organizations like the Rainforest Foundation, the struggle for indigenous peoples is essential for solving the problem of reducing carbon emission, and approaching the threat on both cultural and biological diversity in general.United Nations, State of The World's Indigenous Peoples ‚Äì UNPFII report, First Issue, 2009 Representation The rights, claims and even identity of indigenous peoples are apprehended, acknowledged and observed quite differently from government to government. Various organizations exist with charters to in one way or another promote (or at least acknowledge) indigenous aspirations, and indigenous societies have often banded together to form bodies which jointly seek to further their communal interests. = International organizations = There are several non-governmental civil society movements, networks, indigenous and non-indigenous organizations whose founding mission is to protect indigenous rights, including land rights.Earth Peoples These organizations, networks and groups underline that the problems that indigenous peoples are facing is the lack of recognition that they are entitled to live the way they choose, and lack of the right to their lands and territories. Their mission is to protect the rights of indigenous peoples without states imposing their ideas of \\"development\\". These groups say that each indigenous culture is differentiated, rich of religious believe systems, way of life, sustenance and arts, and that the root of problem would be the interference with their way of living by state's disrespect to their rights, as well as the invasion of traditional lands by multinational corporations and small businesses for exploitation of natural resources. =United Nations= Indigenous peoples and their interests are represented in the United Nations primarily through the mechanisms of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations. In April 2000 the United Nations Commission on Human Rights adopted a resolution to establish the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (PFII) as an advisory body to the Economic and Social Council with a mandate to review indigenous issues. In late December 2004, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed 2005‚Äì2014 to be the Second International Decade of the World's Indigenous People. The main goal of the new decade will be to strengthen international cooperation around resolving the problems faced by indigenous peoples in areas such as culture, education, health, human rights, the environment, and social and economic development. In September 2007, after a process of preparations, discussions and negotiations stretching back to 1982, the General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The non-binding declaration outlines the individual and collective rights of indigenous peoples, as well as their rights to identity, culture, language, employment, health, education and other issues. Four nations with significant indigenous populations voted against the declaration: the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. All four have since then changed their vote in favour. Eleven nations abstained: Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burundi, Colombia, Georgia, Kenya, Nigeria, Russia, Samoa and Ukraine. Thirty-four nations did not vote, while the remaining 143 nations voted for it. =ILO 169= ILO 169 is a convention of the International Labour Organization. Once ratified by a state, it is meant to work as a law protecting tribal people's rights. There are twenty-two physical survival and integrity, but also the preservation of their land, language and religion rights. The ILO is represents indigenous rights as they are the organisation that enforced instruments the deal with indigenous rights exclusively. =Organization of American States= Since 1997, the nations of the Organization of American States have been discussing draft versions of a proposed American Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.Website of the Proposed American Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples \\"The draft declaration is currently one of the most important processes underway with regard to indigenous rights in the Americas\\" as mentioned by the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs. =By country= Australia Early campaigners in South Australia included Charles and Phyllis Duguid. Canada In Canada \\"Aboriginal rights\\" () are those rights that indigenous peoples enjoy as a result of their ancestors' long occupancy of the land, for example the right to hunt and fish a particular territory. These are distinct from \\"treaty rights\\" which are enumerated in specific agreements between indigenous groups and the state. Both treaty rights and Aboriginal rights are protected by Section 35 of the Canadian constitution of 1982.

Book summary  In the first chapter, Prahalad and Krishnan outline their central thesis; that there are new managerial demands in business, requiring new sources of value creation. They argue that these demands have created an N=1 and R=G environment, where companies need to customize their product for each customer by gaining access to a new array of suppliers. The book argues that the old sources of competitive advantage ‚Äì technology, labor, and capital ‚Äì are fading and that new sources are emerging. Prahalad and Krishnan suggest an internal capacity to reconfigure resources in real time by focusing on clearly documented, transparent, and resilient business processes (the link between strategy, business models and operations) has become a strong differentiator. They also argue that a focus on co-creation, by developing an R=G supply network and emphasizing analytics which identify trends and unique opportunities can create a strong competitive advantage. The technical architecture required to develop these flexible and resilient business processes and strong analytics capabilities is outlined in the book. The last four chapters describe how to implement these new strategies. Recognizing that many companies have fragmented and archaic systems, the book describes typical problems that occur when migrating to an N=1 and R=G friendly system. Prahalad and Krishnan emphasize the importance of a social architecture with strong linkages between managers and the technical architecture. They also outline the necessity for companies to recruit new skills from around the world and use globalization to its advantage.  Key concepts  The book argues that \\"the industrial system as we know it has been morphing for some time. Now it may have reached an inflection point.\\"http://www.newageofinnovation.com/blog/archives/2008/04/the_inflection.html Prahalad and Krishnan outline the approach that firms in the new economy must take to survive and become successful. The previous choice between low cost and differentiation is rarely the chief strategic choice anymore, firms must achieve what Prahalad and Krishnan call N=1 and R=G. = N=1 = N=1 requires companies to focus on the importance of individual customer experiences and tailor their product accordingly. It requires that companies have resilient, dynamic and flexible business processes. They also emphasize the importance of strong analytics which allow management to discover trends and unique opportunities and enable the company to engage in product co-creation with their consumer base. = R=G = R=G advises firms take a horizontal approach to supply rather than vertical integration. The focus is on obtaining access, rather than ownership, to resources from an array of suppliers both inside and outside the firm. R=G provides the best opportunity for firms to leverage the necessary resources to co-create a personalized experience for each customer. R=G is often mistaken as a suggestion to outsource, however this is often not the case, as there are many notable instances where it makes sense for companies to leverage local resources to fulfill a personalized demand model.New Age Of Innovation  Does R=G Equal Outsourcing?

It is located approximately west of Sydney and north of the nearest town, Wentworth Falls. Mount Hay is approximately AMSL and is one of several basalt caps located within the UNESCO World Heritage Greater Blue Mountains Area. Description Mount Hay has a dome-like shape at the summit and it can be found on the southern escarpment of the Grose Valley, one of the main valleys of the Blue Mountains. There is a walking track that goes to the top of the mountain, but the initial approach is via the Mount Hay Road, which branches off from the Great Western Highway at the town of Leura. The road, which is unsealed and fairly rough, winds generally north-east for or so and terminates at the Mount Hay picnic area. The latter is extremely basic, with an unreliable water tank, a stone fireplace and enough room for one tent at a pinch. From the picnic area, a track goes to the mountain, which is just over a kilometre away. There are good views of the Grose Valley as the track approaches the mountain, but the views disappear as the track gets higher up. At the top, there is a trigonometric station, but there are no views because of the timber. The top of the mountain is above sea level. Activities The area is popular for bushwalking but not as overused as some parts of the Grose Valley, because it is some distance from the nearest residential areas. About south of the picnic area there are other walk possibilities, in the form of the Lockley Track, which goes down to the Blue Gum Forest, in the Grose Valley. There is also a short walk to the top of the plateau known as Flat Top. Just a little north of the picnic area, there is another track that goes west to Butterbox Point, which provides dramatic views of the valley. The area is also popular for photography because of the extensive valley views. There are no authorised camp sites, but camping is allowed at a reasonable distance from any road.

Background Bl√ºcher and Schwarzenberg agreed to attack Napoleon from both sides with all their united forces, and thus, if possible, to put an end to the war with one blow. Bl√ºcher, therefore, marched from Rheims to Ch√¢lons, Schwarzenberg from Arcis- sur-Aube to Vitry, in search of Napoleon: instead of falling back before him at some distance from one another, and thus giving Napoleon plenty of room, as he had expected, they boldly formed a junction of their several divisions behind him. The Allies hoped that Napoleon might turn back when he found his expectations foiled, and that they would then fight him in the great plains between the Marne and the Aube, where the Allies could make use of their numerical superiority in cavalry against the very inferior French cavalry. But Napoleon was already on his way to Saint-Dizier, and had only left a small division behind him, which occupied the villages along the road, close to Vitry. On 24 March Schwarzenberg reached Vitry, meeting King Frederick William III of Prussia and Tsar Alexander I of Russia there. It was decided to march with the united force towards Paris and to leave the pursuit of Napoleon to the cavalry and horse artillery of General Wintzingerode, who was to harass Napoleon's troops. Taking into consideration all the circumstances of the case, it is impossible not to praise it for great boldness. Napoleon had nothing but chosen troops with him, and could form a junction with the numerous garrisons in his fortified towns. Maison, in the Netherlands, had already joined his forces to those of Carnot, who was then threatening Brussels, and might at any moment render assistance to Napoleon. Behind the Allies the whole country was in a state of insurrection, which would naturally be increased by the approach of Napoleon. Marshal Augereau was at the head of numerous forces at Lyon, and could send troops from thence. Meanwhile, the Allied armies, plunged deeper and deeper into the heart of France, were separated from the sources whence they drew their supplies; the Allies were in the midst of a desolated country, without any point upon which they could fall back for their supplies or support, and were shortly about to appear before the capital of the kingdom, the population of which were perfectly capable of giving employment to, and even destroying, a whole army. All this was sufficient to excite the greatest anxiety; but in their determination the allies clearly took the right course, even had the results been less successful. Paris and Napoleon had now lost the importance which they mutually gave to one another. The large Allied armies broke up their quarters near the Aube and the Marne on 24 and 25 March, on their way to Paris. On the 25th, near Fere-Champenoise, they encountered the united troops of Marshals Marmont and Mortier, who were on their way from Soissons to join Napoleon. After a short but bloody engagement the two marshals were beaten, their troops destroyed, and the march on Paris was resumed. On the evening of 24 March Wintzingerode advanced with all his cavalry from Vitry towards Saint-Dizier, whither Napoleon had directed his march, true to his intention of drawing the allies away from Paris, and approaching his own fortresses. The command of the advance guard was entrusted to Tettenborn, who had five regiments of Cossacks, one of Hussars, and eight pieces of horse artillery under him. The French had withdrawn from the neighbourhood of Vitry during that afternoon, and the Allies only came up with them at nightfall in the village of Thieblemont, where they had some sharp skirmishing with the French infantry. On the following day the pursuit was continued with increased vigour, and the Allies overtook a still larger French division at Saint-Dizier, where a brisk engagement took place. The French held possession of Saint-Dizier with infantry, so as to cover the march of the other troops who were there recrossing and marching along the Marne. From the direction which these troops were taking, it appeared certain that Napoleon intended again to attack the main Allied armies; he must, therefore, have received some intelligence of the direction they were taking towards Paris. On the other side of the river the Allies saw compact masses of troops coming straight towards them, having changed their line of march; they advanced down to the banks, and then marched away up the heights on the left. Tettenborn immediately brought his guns close to the bank of the river, and commenced pouring a murderous fire of cannonballs and grenades upon the nearest French troops, which retreated into the woods with the loss of many men. As a regiment of Cossacks now crossed the Marne, and threatened to cut off the troops in Saint-Dizier, these men, who had bravely stood their ground until now, likewise fled to the woods. However, the French were not long exposed to this fire, as a portion of their artillery, placed on the heights of Valcour, commanding the road which lay through a narrow gorge, soon silenced the Allied guns. The French held the heights of Valcour until evening, and then pursued their retreat towards Wassy. Tettenborn followed close at their heels, and drove them out of the village of Humbecourt, but found it impossible to penetrate further, as the adjoining villages were full of infantry, who offered the most obstinate resistance; a sure sign that the main body of the French army was close by, with the result that the Allied troops could not approach any nearer. The skirmishing continued all the night, during which the Allies saw the whole surface of the country between them and Wassy lighted up with numerous watch- fires, which stretched a long way to the Allies' right along the wood, almost reaching their headquarters. Tettenborn passed the night in Eclaron, while General Wintzingerode fixed his headquarters in Saint-Dizier, and sent a considerable number of troops from Vitry towards Montier-en-Der, so as to secure the Allied right flank. Battle Early on the morning of 26 March Tettenborn found the villages which the French held on the previous day by no means deserted: on the contrary, the French advanced against the Allies. The Allies could clearly perceive large masses of troops in the distance, drawing nearer every moment, followed by still greater numbers; among them were considerable bodies of cavalry. The French, numbering roughly 30,000 men, advanced against the Allies on all sides, forcing the Cossacks to retreat: considerable bodies of cavalry showed themselves on both sides of the Allied force. On first seeing these masses of troops, Tettenborn assured Wintzingerode that the whole French army had turned and was marching against the Allies. The advance of the French was so rapid, and their numbers so great, that to form any plan was useless. The danger was imminent, the nature of the ground prevented the Allies using even one regiment of Cossacks with any advantage, and all the French had to do to entirely cut off the Allied force would be to capture the village of Valcour in the Allied rear before the Allies did. Nothing, therefore, remained but to retreat immediately across the Marne, which Tettenborn did, remaining as long as he could on the left bank of the river, to give Wintzingerode time to take such measures as he might think necessary. Whilst Wintzingerode was still doubtful whether Napoleon was actually approaching with his whole force, and hesitated to give full credit to Tettenborn's statements, he saw General Tschernyscheff suddenly driven back from Montier-en-Der, while he himself was attacked at the same moment. The French poured their forces upon the enemy with incredible rapidity; troop followed troop, the whole plain was covered, and in a few minutes the engagement commenced on all sides. A large number of guns were brought on the plain and pointed against Saint-Dizier. The country was flat, but cut up with vineyards and hedges, and too much hemmed in on all sides by woods and low bottoms for the Allies' numerous cavalry to be used with any advantage. It was still possible by a rapid retreat to avoid an action which the Allies would be sure to lose. Tettenborn tried to impress this upon others; but, unfortunately, 700 Russian chasseurs were stationed in Saint-Dizier; and as these were the only infantry which Wintzingerode had with him, he delayed his retreat in the hope of saving them. He therefore ordered Tettenborn to defend the road to Vitry, while Wintzingerode maintained himself in Saint-Dizier, intending to fall back upon Bar-le-Duc in case of necessity. Meanwhile, the French had crossed the Marne between Valcour and Saint-Dizier, with large bodies of cavalry, infantry, and some artillery, and advanced without impediment towards the road to Vitry: the guns planted on the heights of Valcour had protected this movement. The Russian cavalry and horse artillery were distributed in the plain behind this road; in their rear was the wood, in their front the French, who poured heavy fire into the Allied ranks. The baggage and horses had not yet been sent to the rear, and caused considerable disorder. On one side of this road to the right, Tettenborn stood his ground with about 1,000 horses, of which four squadrons were hussars, the rest Cossacks. A body of at least 10,000 French cavalry had already crossed the Marne, and had forced their way between Tettenborn and Wintzingerode. Tettenborn was in momentary expectation of seeing these masses suddenly deploy and throw his men into utter confusion. Meanwhile, bodies of infantry and artillery continued to cross the river, and to form. It was no use for the Allies to think now of retreating, as the cavalry was close upon them; a resolute front could scarcely check them, much less a retreating foe. Tettenborn, therefore, boldly formed his 1,000 men into a compact body, with which he charged the masses of French with reckless courage, just as they were about to deploy. The hussars and Cossacks fell with the utmost intrepidity upon the French, and drove them before them: the first line was broken, then the second; and the contest was most bloody. But fresh masses of French cavalry deployed on both sides of him; more and more troops came from the background ‚Äì the inequality of numbers was too great, and the greatest bravery of no avail. The Allied troops came within the range of the enemy's guns, broke and were put to the rout along the road to Vitry; here the baggage and horses, flying in all directions, caused indescribable confusion. Tettenborn, who with his officers had maintained the contest to the last, and had been in great personal danger, got his troops again into some order at the village of Perthe, skirmished a little with the French that same evening, and retreated during the night by Marolles to Vitry. His whole loss consisted of only forty men. The rest of Wintzingerode's cavalry, who were drawn up on the plains by Saint-Dizier, and who had waited till the French attacked them, without taking the initiative, had a far greater number of men killed, besides losing many cannon. After a heroic defence of Saint-Dizier, Wintzingerode left that town on the same evening and retreated to Bar-le-Duc, hotly pursued by the French, whom, however, he beat off when they pressed upon him too closely. Results From the Allied point-of-view this battle, in spite of its unfavourable outcome, was most successful in its results: it led Napoleon into an error by which he lost three entire days, during all which time his capital was in imminent danger. Napoleon was convinced that Schwarzenberg's whole army was on his tracks, and Wintzingerode had taken care to strengthen this surmise by hiring rooms at Saint-Dizier for the Emperor of Russia and for the King of Prussia, and by giving out that his cavalry was merely the advance guard of the main army. Napoleon, who learned all this from some of his devoted adherents in Saint-Dizier, halted at Vassy, recalled those troops which had already marched forward, and thought that he would fight a battle where the ground and the circumstances would be in his favour. Even on the day after this action Napoleon could not be brought to believe that he was mistaken, and had been striking at a shadow; he persisted in advancing against Vitry, where the small garrison prepared to meet the storm. There, however, he suddenly learnt of Marmont's and Mortier's defeat at the Battle of F√®re-Champenoise and the advance of the Allies upon Paris: he now hastily collected his weary, half-famished troops, and made forced marches by Troyes, Sens, and Fontainebleau, to relieve his threatened capital.

It saw action in the Second Boer War, the First World War and the Second World War. It amalgamated with the Lanarkshire Yeomanry and the 1st/2nd Lothians and Border Horse to form the Queen's Own Lowland Yeomanry in 1956. Its lineage was revived by B (Lanarkshire and Queen's Own Royal Glasgow Yeomanry) Squadron, the Scottish Yeomanry in 1992 until that unit was disbanded in 1999. HistoryFormation and early history= In 1793, the prime minister, William Pitt the Younger, proposed that the English Counties form a force of Volunteer Yeoman Cavalry that could be called on by the king to defend the country against invasion or by the Lord Lieutenant to subdue any civil disorder within the country. The regiment was first raised in 1796 as \\" The Glasgow Light Horse\\". It was subsequently disbanded in 1822 but re-raised as \\"The Glasgow and Lower Ward of Lanarkshire Yeomanry Cavalry\\" in 1848. The additional title of \\"Queen's Own Royal\\" was conferred by Queen Victoria the following year. =Second Boer War= On 13 December 1899, the decision to allow volunteer forces serve in the Second Boer War was made. Due to the string of defeats during Black Week in December, 1899, the British government realized they were going to need more troops than just the regular army, thus issuing a Royal Warrant on 24 December 1899. This warrant officially created the Imperial Yeomanry. The Royal Warrant asked standing Yeomanry regiments to provide service companies of approximately 115 men each. In addition to this, many British citizens (usually mid-upper class) volunteered to join the new regiment. The first contingent of recruits contained 550 officers, 10,371 men with 20 battalions and 4 companies, which arrived in South Africa between February and April, 1900. The Queen's Own Glasgow Yeomanry provided troops for the 9th (Scottish) Battalion of the Imperial Yeomanry; the companies were: :17th (Ayrshire and Lanarkshire) Company, raised 1900; co-sponsored by Ayrshire Yeomanry Cavalry, and Lanarkshire Yeomanry Cavalry :18th (Queen's Own Royal Glasgow and Lower Ward of Lanark) Company, raised 1900 :19th (Lothians and Berwickshire) Company, raised 1900 :20th (Fife and Forfar Light Horse) Company, raised 1900; co-sponsored by 1st Fifeshire Light Horse Volunteers, and 1st Forfarshire Light Horse Volunteers :107th (Lanarkshire) Company, raised 1901 :108th (Royal Glasgow) Company, raised 1901 The regiment had its headquarters at the Yorkhill Parade drill hall at this time. =First World War= In accordance with the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw. 7, c.9) which brought the Territorial Force into being, the TF was intended to be a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, many members volunteered for Imperial Service. Therefore, TF units were split in August and September 1914 into 1st Line (liable for overseas service) and 2nd Line (home service for those unable or unwilling to serve overseas) units. Later, a 3rd Line was formed to act as a reserve, providing trained replacements for the 1st and 2nd Line regiments.  1/1st Queen's Own Royal Glasgow Yeomanry On mobilisation in August 1914 the 1/1st Queen's Own Royal Glasgow Yeomanry was attached to the Lowland Mounted Brigade and moved with it to Cupar, Fife on coastal defence duties. In May 1915, it left the brigade and was split up as divisional cavalry. *RHQ and C Squadron moved to Egypt in June 1915, landing at Port Said on 22 June. In October they joined the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division at Gallipoli as dismounted troops and participated in the Gallipoli Campaign. In January 1916 they returned to Egypt with the division. In May 1916, RHQ moved to France and joined V Corps Cavalry Regiment. C Squadron remained with the division until August 1917 when it joined XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment, along with A Squadron, Hertfordshire Yeomanry and A Squadron, Duke of Lancaster's Own Yeomanry. In May 1918 it joined Palestine LoC for the rest of the war. * A Squadron initially joined the 11th (Northern) Division at Aldershot on 2 June 1915 but moved to 24th Division by the end of the month. On 1 September 1915 it landed at Le Havre. The squadron was attached to 2nd Cavalry Division from 30 April to 14 May 1916 and joined V Corps Cavalry Regiment on 21 May. * B Squadron joined the 9th (Scottish) Division in France in May 1915, leaving them a year later in May 1916 for V Corps Cavalry Regiment. V Corps Cavalry Regiment was assembled in France in May 1916 with the RHQ, A and B Squadrons along with B Squadron, Lothians and Border Horse. In July 1917 the regiment was dismounted and the squadrons were sent to No. 21 Infantry Base Depot at √âtaples for infantry training on 23 August. On 29 September, 4 Officers and 146 Other Ranks joined 18th Battalion, Highland Light Infantry in 106th Brigade, 35th Division at Aizecourt-le-Bas which was redesignated as 18th (Royal Glasgow Yeomanry) Battalion, Highland Light Infantry. The battalion was still in 106th Brigade, 35th Division at the end of the war, west of Grammont, Belgium.  2/1st Queen's Own Royal Glasgow Yeomanry The 2nd Line regiment was formed in Glasgow in 1914. It remained there until May 1915 when it moved to Hawick. In March 1916, the regimental HQ, A and B Squadrons joined the 65th (2nd Lowland) Division in Essex. They were later reduced to a single squadron. In January 1917, they moved to Ireland with 65th Division and in February 1918 were absorbed into the 1st Reserve Cavalry Regiment at The Curragh. In the meantime, C Squadron joined the 64th (2nd Highland) Division in Norfolk in 1916 and was disbanded in 1917.  3/1st Queen's Own Royal Glasgow Yeomanry The 3rd Line regiment was formed in 1915 and in the summer it was affiliated to a Reserve Cavalry Regiment at Aldershot. In June 1916 it was affiliated to the 1st Reserve Cavalry Regiment, also at Aldershot. Early in 1917 it was absorbed in the 4th Reserve Cavalry Regiment, still at Aldershot. As the 1st Line had been converted to infantry, it is probable that some of the men joined the 5th (Reserve) Battalion of the Highland Light Infantry at Catterick. =Between the Wars= When the Territorial Force reformed as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1920, the 14 senior Yeomanry regiments remained as horsed cavalry regiments (6 forming the 5th and 6th Cavalry Brigades) the remaining Yeomanry regiments were re-roled as Royal Artillery (RA). In 1922 the regiment became 101st (Queen's Own Royal Glasgow Yeomanry) Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, with 401 and 402 Field Batteries at Glasgow. It was an 'Army' field brigade in the 52nd (Lowland) Division area.Litchfield, p. 293.Litchfield, Appendix VII.Titles & Designations 1927. In 1938 the regiment re-roled again, becoming 54th (Queen's Own Royal Glasgow Yeomanry) Anti-Tank Regiment, RA, with 213 (Queen's Own Royal Glasgow Yeomanry), 214 (Queen's Own Royal Glasgow Yeomanry) and 215 (City of Glasgow) Anti-Tank Batteries at Glasgow, and 216 (Clyde) Anti-Tank Battery at Kirkintilloch.Farndale, Annex K.Monthly Army List May 1939. The Territorial Army was doubled in size after the Munich Crisis, and the regiment formed a duplicate regiment, 64th (Queen's Own Royal Glasgow Yeomanry) Anti-Tank Regiment, RA based at Milngavie in Dunbartonshire.Litchfield, p. 281. =Second World War=  54th (Queen's Own Royal Glasgow Yeomanry) Anti-Tank Regiment, RA Mobilised in 1939 as part of the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division, the regiment moved to France as a part of the 'Second B.E.F' in June 1940. After being evacuated from France during Operation Ariel together with the rest of the division the regiment trained in mountain warfare at Inveraray in Scotland. Two batteries of the 54th were sent to Normandy about a week after D day. They embarked at Tilbury Docks and landed in France using Mulberry harbours. The regiment saw action during Operation Goodwood and in engagements to the east of Caen. It joined up with the 52 Lowland Division again at Antwerp at the end of September 1944. In August 1944 the regiment became part of the First Allied Airborne Army. (As a mountain formation, it had little heavy equipment and transport, and could therefore operate as an air-transportable formation). The regiment returned to France in October 1944, and were assigned to the First Canadian Army to help open the vital port of Antwerp and were involved in the Scheldt Estuary of Belgium and the Netherlands. Operation Vitality, Operation Infatuate and the capture of the island of Walcheren to open the mouth of the Scheldt estuary. In January 1945 it participated in Operation Blackcock, the clearing of the Roer Triangle between the rivers Meuse and Roer.Joslen, p. 85.  64th (Queen's Own Royal Glasgow Yeomanry) Anti-Tank Regiment, RA Mobilised in September 1939 the regiment remained in the United Kingdom as part of the second-line 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division until July 1942 when the regiment became an integral part of the newly created 78th \\"Battleaxe\\" Infantry Division. The 78th was formed specifically for Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa, from regular British Army units, landing at Algiers in November 1942. Thereafter it continued to fight in the Tunisia Campaign, then in the Allied invasion of Sicily, up the length of Italy during the Italian Campaign, before finally arriving in Austria for the end of the war in Europe in May 1945. Units also saw action in Greece, Palestine, and Egypt. Notable engagements include in Tunisia Longstop Hill, in Sicily the Battle of Centuripe and, while fighting in the Italian Campaign, the assaults on the Viktor Line (Battle of Termoli), the Barbara Line and the River Sangro (Gustav Line) as well as the Battle of Monte Cassino, the Gothic Line and the Battle of the Argenta Gap, part of the final Spring 1945 offensive in Italy.Joslen, pp. 58 & 101.Martin, pp. 3, 14. 17-pdr anti-tank gun of the 64th Anti-Tank Regiment (Queen's Own Royal Glasgow Yeomanry), Tunisia, 20 February 1943. =Post war= In 1947, 64th Anti-Tank Regiment was disbandedFarndale, Annex M. while 54th Anti-Tank Regiment was reconstituted in the Territorial Army as a yeomanry regiment in the Royal Armoured Corps under its old title of the Queen's Own Royal Glasgow Yeomanry. In 1956 it amalgamated with the Lanarkshire Yeomanry and the 1st/2nd Lothians and Border Horse to form the Queen's Own Lowland Yeomanry. The lineage of the regiment was revived with the formation of B (Lanarkshire and Queen's Own Royal Glasgow Yeomanry) Squadron, the Scottish Yeomanry at East Kilbride in November 1992 but that regiment was disbanded a result of the Strategic Defence Review in July 1999. Battle honours Honorary Distinction awarded to the Shropshire Yeomanry for service as a Royal Artillery regiment. The Queen's Own Royal Glasgow Yeomanry Honorary Distinction would be similar. The Queen's Own Royal Glasgow Yeomanry was awarded the following battle honours: ;Second Boer War South Africa 1900‚Äì01 ;World War I Loos, Ypres 1917 '18, Passchendaele, Somme 1918, Bapaume 1918, Ancre 1918, Coutrai, France and Flanders 1915‚Äì18 ;World War II The Royal Artillery was present in nearly all battles and would have earned most of the honours awarded to cavalry and infantry regiments. In 1833, William IV awarded the motto Ubique (meaning \\"everywhere\\") in place of all battle honours. Honorary Distinction: Badge of the Royal Regiment of Artillery with year-dates \\"1940 '42‚Äì45\\" and four scrolls: \\"North-West Europe\\", \\"North Africa\\", \\"Sicily\\" and \\"Italy\\" Uniform and insignia Prior to 1902, the Regiment wore a dragoon style uniform of dark blue with red facings, which had not altered a great deal since its establishment in 1848. A silver spiked helmet with black plumes was worn by all ranks in full dress.

CIA officials read the manuscript and told Marchetti and Marks that they had to remove 339 passages, nearly a fifth of the book. After long negotiations the CIA yielded on 171 items. That left 168 censored passages. The publisher, Alfred A. Knopf, decided to go ahead and publish the book with blanks for those passages, and with the sections that the CIA had originally cut then restored printed in boldface. The publication of Marchetti and Marks' censored book, which became a bestseller, raised concerns about the way the CIA was censoring information. It contributed to investigative reports by Seymour Hersh in The New York Times and the decision by Frank Church to establish the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities in 1975. The report, Foreign and Military Intelligence, was published in 1976. =The Search for the Manchurian Candidate= Marks' 1979 book, The Search for the Manchurian Candidate describes a wide range of CIA activities during the Cold War, including unethical drug experiments in the context of a mind-control and chemical interrogation research program.The Search for the \\"Manchurian Candidate\\": The CIA and Mind Control: The Secret History of the Behavioral Sciences: John D.

Crete, 2001. The saint holds a plate with two eyeballs on it. She is considered to be a healer of the blind. One of her visitors has left a votive offering (tama) depicting eyes to indicate what her affliction is. Tama (, pl. œÑŒ¨ŒºŒ±œÑŒ± tamata) are a form of votive offering or ex-voto used in the Eastern Orthodox Churches, particularly the Greek Orthodox Church. Tamata are usually small metal plaques, which may be of base or precious metal, usually with an embossed image symbolizing the subject of prayer for which the plaque is offered.  Ceremony and symbolism  Tamata may be offered to an icon or shrine of a saint as a reminder of a petitioner's particular need, or in gratitude for a prayer answered. A wonderworking icon of the Theotokos, \\"The Three-handed\\" (Trojeruƒçica), the third hand in silver is a votive offering in thanksgiving for a miracle. A wide variety of images may be found on tamata, with the images capable of multiple interpretations. A heart may symbolize a prayer for love or a heart problem. Eyes may indicate an eye affliction, hands or legs may indicate maladies of the limbs, a pair of wedding crowns may mean a prayer for a happy marriage, a torso for afflictions of the body, and so forth. Tamata may be bought in shops selling Greek Orthodox religious items, and then hung with a ribbon on a pole or hooks near an icon or shrine of a saint, the act of which is usually accompanied with a prayer, and sometimes with the lighting of a votive candle. The destinations of pilgrimages often include shrines decorated with many tamata. One of the most famous Orthodox votive offerings is that by Saint John of Damascus. According to tradition, while he was serving as Vizier to the Caliph, he was falsely accused of treachery and his hand was cut off. Upon praying in front of an icon of the Theotokos his hand was miraculously restored. In thanksgiving, he had a silver replica of his hand fashioned and attached it to the icon (see image at left). This icon, now called \\"Trojeruƒçica\\" (The Three-handed) is preserved at Hilandar Monastery on Mount Athos. Tamata may be compared to many forms of Roman Catholic votive offerings, such as the Milagros traditionally used for healing purposes and as votive offerings in the Roman Catholic cultures of Mexico, the southern United States, Latin America, and parts of the Iberian peninsula.

It is one of two courses owned by Erie County. Course The golf course is located at 3781 Main Street. The 18-hole course is (from the back tees) and is a par 69. It has a course rating of 65.5 and a slope rating of 102. History The course was founded as The Country Club of Buffalo on February 11, 1889, and was originally located at the intersection of Elmwood Avenue and Nottingham Terrace, near the present-day Delaware Park and SUNY‚ÄìBuffalo State College. After purchasing the 1823 Samuel Schenck House, which included the Old Stone House, farm and orchard at 3781 Main St, they moved from their site on Elmwood Ave. The CCB built the original club house, polo field, archery field, tennis courts and lastly the 18 hole golf course. Noted architect E.B. Green designed the first clubhouse, which opened in August 1889. In 1899, the club relocated to make way for the 1901 Pan-American Exposition. The clubhouse became the Women's Center during the Pan-American Exposition. The club acquired land at the intersection of Main Street at Bailey Avenue at the City of Buffalo‚Äôs border with the Town of Amherst. The club began construction of a golf course at that time and constructed a clubhouse on the site in 1901. George Cary, who also designed the landmarked Buffalo History Museum, designed the clubhouse. The 18-hole golf course, tennis courts, and a polo field were completed in 1902. In 1910, A.L. Pfitzner, a pilot from Curtiss, made the first airplane flight in Western New York from the club's grounds. In 1910 and 1911, Walter J. Travis renovated the course in anticipation of attracting a major golf tournament. In 1912, the course hosted the 1912 U.S. Open, won by the defending champion, 20-year-old John J. McDermott, Jr., still the youngest-ever champion and the first American to win the title. McDermott won the tournament with a score of 283. =Sale= In 1922, the Country Club of Buffalo began acquiring new property, and in 1925, the existing course was sold to the City of Buffalo for $800,000. In 1926, the club completed its relocation to its present location in the Town of Amherst at 250 Youngs Road in Williamsville, New York. When the club moved to its present location in Amherst, the existing site was renamed Grover Cleveland Park to honor the former Mayor of Buffalo, Governor of New York, and President of the United States. It was at this time, that the Main St. property was rezoned from being part of Amherst, NY to becoming part of Buffalo, NY. The present course has hosted the U.S. Women's Amateur in 1931, the Curtis Cup in 1950, the Carling Cup Matches in 1960, and the National Junior Girls Championship in 1962. =Country Club of Buffalo= The transported Country Club of Buffalo, located in the Town of Amherst is a (from the back tees), par 72 Donald J.

He was the owner of Chartham Paper Mills and a Member of Parliament. Records show that cricket was played on this ground in the 1880s but the Club was formed under the patronage of John Howard in 1903. Cricket has been played continuously since then with the exception of the periods during the two World Wars. In the 1930s, cricket weeks were held at the Park, marquees erected and this became very much a part of the social life of the village and the surrounding area. =Development= After the second World War the club slowly developed though funds and resources were scarce. The skills of the Club members were put to good use in improving the ground and pavilion facilities. A small wooden pavilion with no electricity, mains water or mains drainage progressed to a purpose-built brick pavilion. Caption1 =Cricket= In the 1960s it was decided that the Club could field an occasional and XI. A little later a Colts section was started (the first in the Folkestone and Hythe area). The Club fields two Saturday and two Sunday sides with mid-week cricket and Junior cricket in several age groups. The 1st XI has just gained promotion to the 1st Division of the Kent League and the second XI was promoted to the 2nd Division in 2003. Development In 1998 a new net practice facility was built with two full-sized double nets (with help from the National Lottery). The winter of 2000/2001 saw the ground and pavilion under several feet of water for six months. The pavilion was re-furbished and cricket was played on the late May Bank Holiday. The following autumn a comprehensive drainage and pumping system was installed to prevent flooding happening again. In 2003 the Club celebrated its Centenary with a Cricket week which included a game against the MCC. In 2004, the club became the first sports club in Folkestone and Hythe and only third cricket club in Kent to be awarded the ECB and Sport England Clubmark and in 2006 became one of the county's first Focus Clubs. In 2007 the ground was extended to accommodate a larger Junior section and a new Girls' section.

It was the first research institution of its kind, and brought Sindhology to the forefront of international research.University of Sind (1977). Vol. 1-9 Sindhology refers to knowledge about Sindh. The history and culture of Sindh has been shaped by the Indus River. This lifeline of Sindh brings minerals and soil from the Himalayas to the region, then flows into the Arabian Sea at the Indus River Delta located in Sindh. These factors define the scope of Sindhology: the study of antiquities, the relics, the history, and the culture both of ancient and modern Sindh, with particular reference to Sindhi society and literature. The institute provides a repository of this knowledge in the form of a research- oriented center of learning. History The history of the institute goes back to the establishment of the Sindhi Academy in 1962 by the University of Sindh. The objective was to develop a facility to archive books, manuscripts, and research papers from past and present. Another objective was to promote and publish research about Sindh in the Sindhi language in addition to other languages such as Arabic, English, Persian and Urdu. The research was to be promoted in all Pakistani universities.Yusuf (1975) This was also the first time when Sindhology and its scholars were given well-deserved international attention. In 1964, the nomenclature and the status of the Sindhi Academy were changed to the Institute of Sindhology to work on the similar patterns of Indology and Egyptology. The institute was to encourage further historical research on the Indus Valley Civilization as well as contemporary living in Sindh.Allana (1978) The institute was provided with a small room at the old campus of Sindh University in Hyderabad. On 10 December 1972 the foundation stone of the new building was laid just off the Super Highway in Jamshoro, adjacent to Indus river. The three-storey building, located 12 kilometers from Hyderabad and 150 km from Karachi was inaugurated in 1978. The construction is an amalgamation of the Islamic and Buddhist architectures. Internally, the building is decorated with local Hala tile-work, with two arms accommodating the Research Library and Administration Block. The central dome houses the Anthropological Research Centre (Museum), Art Gallery, Film and Photographic Sections and Audio-visual Section. In 2015 International children‚Äôs films festival was held in Sindhology. In 1987, an extension was built in celebration of the institute's Silver Jubilee to house the Bookshop facilities. Over the years, institute has transformed itself into one of the leading research institutes in Pakistan. Research Being affiliated with an academic institution (Sindh University), the institute contributes to the scientific research and academic studies in the subject of Sindhology. The first major initiative to bring he subject to international attention was a series of surveys to identify the sites of major anthropological and archaeological research across the province, carried out in cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution between 1967-71. There were also cooperations with UNESCO to explore the Sindhology aspects of the major Indus valley Civilization sites across Sindh.World Sindhi Congress (2005). Sindhi Academic Studies . Retrieved on 23 June 2008. Research and academic scope of the institute have broadened since then. These and many other subsequent research contributions of the institute brought it to the list of internationally recognised research centres of the world.Gill and Smith (1982). p. 663 Museum Within the institute, the Anthropological Research Center and Sindh Arts Gallery is responsible for the maintenance of the museum. The centre provides attractions both for research scholars and general public. Artifacts on display in the museum represent the history and demography of the region. The collections contain archaeological material, wood-work, thread- work, metal-work, leather-work, pottery, jewellery, coins, armaments, photographs, and paintings that have been collected since the 1970s. The museum space has been divided into various sections named as general, coins, archaeological, ethnological, ethno-musical, photographic, and Indus-painting galleries respectively. There is a special gallery devoted to prominent personalities that contains portraits of more than 175 eminent writers, scholars, educationists, social workers, Philanthropists, politicians, lawyers, freedom fighters, spiritual leaders and public figures. Special corners are devoted for people such as Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Allama I.I. Kazi, Hassan Ali Affendi, Pir Hussamuddin Rashdi, Syed Gulam Mustafa Shah, Muhammad Usman Diplai, and Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. There are also and specific galleries for Benazir Bhutto and N.A Baloch, as well as Mir Talpur's Court. Prominent artefacts include the harmonium on which Ahmed Ghulamali Chagla composed the National Anthem of Pakistan; the first Sindhi Typewriter, manufactured in 1926; and the statue of Rai Bahadur Odhoudas Chhabria, founder of Odhoudas Hospital of Shikarpur. The work is ongoing for the collection, preservation and conservation of anthropological, historical and cultural objects and specimen. Field surveys are also conducted in villages and remote areas of Sindh to access the rare articles. =Music gallery= The ethno-musical gallery comprises sections on performing arts, sounds, and films. Sindhi music with its original form and rhythm has withstood the test of time. Especially, the Sindhi folk tunes continue to enrich the traditions and customs of the people of rural areas and attracts the attention of urban dwellers.Myers (1993) This aspects makes the Sindhi music research and preservation an integral part of the regional cultural heritage. Hence, the Institute of Sindhology has devised innovative ways to preserve this.Allana (1982) The special unit of the institute visits remote villages, recording the various items of Sindhi music, folklore, folk tales and tunes played on local musical instruments. The collection has been gradually growing, and is made available on tapes and cassettes in its original form and shape. Library The institute boasts a research library with many corners named after prominent Sindhi scholars. The Research section of the library continues to archive and document the regional heritage. The work started with compilation and publication of catalogues, bibliographies, directories and periodical literature. This resulted in the development of a directory of Sindhi writers; a source book on prominent personalities of Sindh; and, a bibliography of Sindhi books. The library archives have served as primary sources for many of the prominent publications on Sindhi culture.Abbas and Fernea (2002) Publications As the institute is mainly concerned with the culture and civilization of Sindh through the ages, a special Bureau of Production, Publication and Translation has been set up to highlight significant achievements through publications. More than 185 books have been published in Sindhi, English, Urdu, Arabic and Punjabi languages. The publication of research work keeps special focus on various aspects of Sindh. There are also two Bi-annual journals in published in English and Sindhi languages under the titles of Sindhological Studies and Sindhi Adab (Sindhi literature) respectively. Some of the major publications are: * Sindhi lekhkan‚Äìji Directory - 1974, (A directory of the writers of Sindhi Language). * Chapial Sindhi Kitaban‚Äìji Bibliography - 1947-1973 - 1976.

He made his professional debut in 1967, reaching the top makuuchi division in 1974. His highest rank was sekiwake. During his long career he won several awards and set a number of longevity records. Upon his retirement in 1988 he became a sumo coach and elder of the Japan Sumo Association, until reaching 65 years of age in 2018. Career He made his professional debut in May 1967 at the age of just 14, joining Nishonoseki stable. At first he fought under his own surname of Tarusawa, before adopting the shikona of Kirinji in January 1974 upon promotion to the second highest j≈´ry≈ç division. The shikona had previously been used by one of his stablemates, ozeki Daikirin. Kirinji reached the top makuuchi division in September 1974 and remained there for 84 tournaments, a record at the time second only to Takamiyama's 97. The run was not consecutive however, as he dropped to j≈´ry≈ç briefly in November 1979 after sitting out the previous tournament through injury. He fought in 1221 top division bouts in total, the eleventh highest in history. He spent ten tournaments at komusubi rank, the first in March 1975 and the last thirteen years later in January 1988, making him one of the oldest postwar sanyaku wrestlers. He reached his highest rank of sekiwake for the first time in July 1975 and held it on seven occasions in total. He never won a top division tournament but was a runner-up on two occasions, to Kitanoumi in September 1978 and to Chiyonofuji in March 1982. He won eleven sansh≈ç, or special prizes, placing him joint tenth on the all-time list, and earned six kinboshi or gold stars for defeating yokozuna. His last kinboshi against Onokuni in May 1988 came just two tournaments before his retirement. His spirited match with Fujizakura in May 1975 was particularly memorable and was enjoyed by the then Emperor Hirohito, a sumo fan. After fierce thrusting attacks from both sides, Kirinji eventually won the bout with an uwatenage, or outer arm throw. He was awarded the Fighting Spirit prize at the end of that tournament. The bout was later released on DVD as one of the \\"Best Matches in the 20th Century.\\" Retirement from sumo Two days into the September 1988 tournament, where at 35 years of age he was the oldest in his division, Kirinji pulled out with a knee injury. He announced his retirement from sumo on the 14th day. He remained in the sumo world as a coach at Nishonoseki stable under the elder name Kitajin Oyakata. Although the stable closed in January 2013, the stable to which he moved, Matsugane, was re-named Nishonoseki stable in 2014. He reached the mandatory retirement age for coaches of 65 in March 2018 and left the Japan Sumo Association.

He appears in Tolstoy's War and Peace. Ferdinand von Wintzingerode was born into a noble family of Thuringia. His father, baron Wilhelm Levin Ernst von Wintzingerode (1738‚Äì1781), owned the Unterhof seigneurial domain near Kirchohmfeld. Ferdinand's first military service was in the Hessian Army, then as a volunteer in the Austrian army in the war against the Netherlands. He took part in the 1792‚Äì93 campaigns against the French and, after the peace of Campo Formio on 17 October 1797, he was offered a post as major in the Russian army. In 1800 the Austrian army gave him permission to fight in the war in Italy. On 19 September 1801 he married the Polish countess H√©l√®ne Rostworowska (1783‚Äì1829), with whom he had one son. He became a major general and general aide de camp to Alexander I of Russia in 1802 and was entrusted with diplomatic missions over the following years. Also, in 1805 in Berlin, he negotiated with Austria and Great Britain on behalf of the Prussians to form the three nations into an alliance against France. On 11 November 1805, at D√ºrenstein, he received the Order of Saint George. He returned to the Austrian army in 1809, where he was made field marshal. He led the advance guard of the first brigade of general Bellegarde's army on 20 May at Aspern, where he was wounded in the right leg. He returned to the Russian army in 1812 to face the French invasion of Russia. In it he was made lieutenant general and grand cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa. On 21 October 1812 he led a unit of Cossacks trying to reach the Kremlin by challenging several French posts at the head of a Cossack unit, but he and his aide de camp NarichzinVictoires conqu√™tes d√©sastres revers et guerres civiles des fran√ßais de 1789 √† 1815, Panckouke et Lecointe, Paris, 1836, tome 11 page 431 were captured by lieutenant Leleu de Maupertuis of the 5th Imperial Guard Chasseurs Regiment.

Both were broad gauge branches from the main Gippsland line in Victoria, Australia. The first was a line branching from a junction at Hernes Oak, situated between Moe and Morwell, which was in service from 1922-1955. The second Yallourn railway line junctioned at Moe, and was used between 1953 and 1986. Operated by the Victorian Railways and successors, the lines served the Yallourn Power Station, the associated open cut brown coal mine, and a briquette factory complex, all operated by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria (SECV), as well as the adjacent company town of Yallourn. The alignment of the first branch line has been lost due to the expansion of the Yallourn mine. The second line is now part of the Moe to Yallourn Rail Trail. History The first branch was opened in January 1922 to transport briquettes from the briquette production operations at Yallourn to Melbourne, in addition to transporting supplies to the power station located beside the coal mine. It left the main line at Hernes Oak, initially with a staff locked set of points and a loop siding.Victorian Railways signal diagram: When traffic increased, that was altered to include a crossing loop, siding, and signal box.Victorian Railways signal diagram: In later years, outward traffic from the briquette works increased, and an electrification program for the Gippsland line was put into place as part of Operation Phoenix. Further complications arose when expansion plans for the Yallourn open cut mine encroached on the alignment of the branch, and given the presence of 1:50 gradients on the line, it was decided to rebuild the line to Yallourn along a completely new alignment. Work started in 1949 but was hampered by labour shortages, and the new 9.7 kilometre branch, on a 1 in 110 grade, was brought into service in September 1953. The electrification of the new line was not commissioned until September 1955, when work on the main line to Melbourne had been completed. The old route via Hernes Oak was initially retained, being used by down empty to trains, with loaded trains using the new line to return to Melbourne. A new signal box at Yallourn marshalling yard was opened in December 1953, allowing two-way operation on the new line. The old line fell into disuse but was not removed until March 1957, when the SECV began to expand the Yallourn open cut mine across the alignment. At the Hernes Oak end, part of the former line was retained as a dead end siding.Victorian Railways signal diagram: Despite the expansion of the mine, briquette traffic began to decline, with power generation at Yallourn growing in demand instead. Due to the decrease in railway traffic the signal box and interlocking at Yallourn was removed in May 1968, and in April 1974 the substation was taken out of use, overhead power being fed from Moe. In October 1978 electric trains were banned from the line, and in March 1979 work began on removing the overhead wiring. The line itself was closed in December 1986 which was, in effect, just a 'book date'. Facilities at Yallourn The sidings at Yallourn crossed the SECV operated Yallourn 900mm Railway in a number of places. By 1953 broad gauge facilities in Yallourn included: * Main line from Moe (new line) * Main line from Hernes Oak (old line) * Passenger platform, goods shed and 5 road yard serving the town of Yallourn, all facing a dead end and accessed via the old line * Sidings to move machinery and other equipment to the briquette factory * Marshalling yard and sidings to handle the outbound traffic from the briquette factory. * A reversing triangle * Coal stage and basic repair facilities * Sidings serving the SECV workshops for the open cut mine * Sidings serving the SECV main stores * Sidings serving the SECV power station * A line running across the Latrobe River to the Yallourn North open cut mine At the time of the opening of the new line from Moe, a new railway station and goods shed to serve to town of Yallourn was opened, the responsibility taken by the SECV. The railway station closed to passengers in the 1960s.

Approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2000, it is designed to facilitate surgery using a minimally invasive approach, and is controlled by a surgeon from a console. The system is used for prostatectomies, and increasingly for cardiac valve repair and gynecologic surgical procedures.\\"Robots as surgical enablers\\". MarketWatch. 3 February 2005. Retrieved 17 March 2013.\\"Prepping Robots to Perform Surgery\\". The New York Times. 4 May 2008. Retrieved 17 March 2013. According to the manufacturer, the da Vinci System is called \\"da Vinci\\" in part because Leonardo da Vinci's \\"study of human anatomy eventually led to the design of the first known robot in history.\\" Da Vinci Surgical Systems were used in an estimated 200,000 surgeries in 2012, most commonly for hysterectomies and prostate removals. In 2019-2020, there are an installed base of 4,986 units worldwide ‚Äì 2,770 in the United States, 719 in Europe, 561 in Asia, and 221 in the rest of the world. The \\"Si\\" version of the system costs on average slightly under US$2 million, in addition to several hundred thousand dollars of annual maintenance fees.\\"The Slow Rise of the Robot Surgeon\\". MIT Technology Review. 24 March 2010. Retrieved 23 March 2013. The da Vinci system has been criticised for its cost and for a number of issues with its surgical performance. Medical uses While the use of robotic surgery has become an item in the advertisement of medical services, there is a lack of studies that indicated long-term results are superior to results following laparoscopic surgery. The da Vinci System has been used in the following procedures: * Radical prostatectomy, pyeloplasty, cystectomy, nephrectomy and ureteral reimplantation; * Hysterectomy, myomectomy and sacrocolpopexy; * Hiatal hernia repair; * Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) for head and neck cancer (FDA- approved since 2009) Device da Vinci patient-side component (left) and surgeon console (right) A surgeon console at the treatment centre of Addenbrooke's Hospital The da Vinci System consists of a surgeon's console that is typically in the same room as the patient, and a patient-side cart with three to four interactive robotic arms (depending on the model) controlled from the console. The arms are for tools that hold objects, and can also act as scalpels, scissors, bovies, or graspers; the final arm controls the 3-D cameras. The surgeon uses the console's controls to maneuver the patient-side cart's three or four robotic arms. The da Vinci System always requires a human operator. FDA clearance The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared the da Vinci Surgical System in 2000 for adult and pediatric use in urologic surgical procedures, general laparoscopic surgical procedures, gynecologic laparoscopic surgical procedures, general non-cardiovascular thoracoscopic surgical procedures, and thoracoscopically assisted cardiotomy procedures. The FDA also cleared the da Vinci System to be employed with adjunctive mediastinotomy to perform coronary anastomosis during cardiac revascularization. Criticism Critics of robotic surgery assert that it is difficult for users to learn and that it has not been shown to be more effective than traditional laparoscopic surgery. The da Vinci system uses proprietary software, which cannot be modified by physicians, thereby limiting the freedom to modify the operation system. Furthermore, its $2 million cost places it beyond the reach of many institutions. The manufacturer of the system, Intuitive Surgical, has been criticized for short-cutting FDA approval by a process known as \\"premarket notification,\\" which claims the product is similar to already-approved products. Intuitive has also been accused of providing inadequate training, and encouraging health care providers to reduce the number of supervised procedures required before a doctor is allowed to use the system without supervision. There have also been claims of patient injuries caused by stray electrical currents released from inappropriate parts of the surgical tips used by the system. Intuitive counters that the same type of stray currents can occur in non-robotic laparoscopic procedures. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that side effects and blood loss in robotically-performed hysterectomies are no better than those performed by traditional surgery, despite the significantly greater cost of the system. As of 2013, the FDA is investigating problems with the da Vinci robot, including deaths during surgeries that used the device; a number of related lawsuits are also underway. From a social analysis, a disadvantage is the potential for this technology to dissolve the creative freedoms of the surgeon, once hailed by scholar Timothy Lenoir as one of the most professional individual autonomous occupations to exist. Lenoir claims that in the \\"heroic age of medicine,\\" the surgeon was hailed as a hero for his intuitive knowledge of human anatomy and his well-crafted techniques in repairing vital body systems. Lenoir argues that the da Vinci's 3D console and robotic arms create a mediating form of action called medialization, in which internal knowledge of images and routes within the body become external knowledge mapped into simplistic computer coding.  Popular culture  On August 11, 2010 Edward Hospital released a video on YouTube of them demonstrating the Da Vinci Si Surgical System's precision by performing the task of peeling the skin off of a grape. In 2017, a clip of the original video was added to a video created by Cheddar's YouTube channel with the caption ‚ÄúThey did surgery on a grape‚Äù. People began sharing the post with the same caption ‚ÄúThey did surgery on a grape‚Äù. The initial versions of the meme made fun of the dry caption in the Cheddar video, by adding the caption ‚ÄúThey did surgery on a grape‚Äù as many times as they could to their post. The phrase also became popular on Twitter, with many tweets trying to use the phrase in as many creative ways as possible.

As Denmark struggled with the financial burden that the Napoleonic wars had on the economy, the devaluation of the currency had negative effects on merchants, citizens and businesses alike. As Denmark allied with France in 1807 in the aftermath of British attacks on Copenhagen, it incurred costs of rearmament as machinery, equipment and supplies were required for wartime efforts. As a result, when the economic burden placed on the state began to take its toll the collapse of the currency became imminent. The loyalty shown to Napoleon and France by Frederik VI and Denmark was eventually cause for great loss. The Treaty of Kiel, signed in January 1814, saw Denmark lose considerable power in Europe. Ceding claim to the Kingdom of Norway to Sweden, put even further pressure on export and import trading as well as an already weak economy. Due to consequences of the Napoleonic wars, Denmark was forced to declare bankruptcy on 5 January 1813. The Danish government through monetary and economic policy had two main objectives; stabilise the economy and create a unified state-wide monetary system. The Rigsbank was the first governmental institution tasked with stabilising the economy by re-structuring the currency. In 1818, the Nationalbank, a privately operated institution was formed to extend credit benefits from citizens to businesses, and aid the revival of the Danish economy. The objective was to reinstate silver as the overarching currency in the Danish economy and restore confidence in a central banking system.  History  Napoleonic Wars = Denmark, had remained adjacent to early preceding's of the Napoleonic Wars. Russia and France both had vested interest in Denmark and its naval fleet and its use of Norwegian-Danish trade routes. The British understood they would need to lay siege to the fleet if they were to gain control over vital sea lanes. In September 1807, the British empire bombed Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, in order to capture or destroy the Dano-Norwegian fleet. The bombardment on the Danish capital, allowed the British to take vital sea lanes in the Baltic and North Sea. Frederik VI and his monarchy viewed the ruling of Norway as essential to its European power. A lack of stability in the Norwegian grain supply as well as the chance for French invasion drove the strategy for an alliance with Napoleon. Denmark had little to offer France as the naval strength had been eliminated. The cost of rearmament and war time preparations took a toll on the Danish economy. Adding to the loss in the attack on Copenhagen in 1807, Frederik VI remained loyal to Napoleon and France, even as Sweden and Russia switched alliances to Great Britain. When France attacked Russia in 1812, both nations effectively allied with Great Britain, leaving their alliance with France behind. After suffering a prolonged period of defeat between 1810‚Äì1812, Frederik VI, the king of Denmark, was increasingly concerned about losing claims to Norway and the land owned in the North of Germany. = Bankruptcy declared = On January 5, 1813, Denmark declared bankruptcy and a new state bank, the Rigsbank, was created to bring the economy out of hardship. The main agenda for the Rigsbank was to re- organise and stabilise the state's monetary system. When Denmark allied with France in 1807, the Fontainebleua Treaty was signed between France and Denmark. Denmark was promised favourable loans and subsidies that would cover financial costs of wartime readying. However, the terms of the treaty were not upheld and it was Denmark who covered the cost of the French push in Denmark in 1808. Adding to this, the promise of troops and equipment to Napoleon throughout the war, only furthered the costs Denmark were to bear. = Treaty of Kiel, 1814 = The Treaty of Kiel was a 14 article document signed in January 1814 between Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom, ending the Napoleonic wars. Sweden and the United Kingdom, under the sixth coalition were united in battle against Denmark and Norway who was allied with France. Denmark, due to its defeat in the war and the ensuing Treaty of Kiel, were obligated to cede Heligoland to the United Kingdom.King Frederik VI Denmark's rule of the Kingdom of Norway was relinquished to King Charles XIII of Sweden, a great disappointment to King Frederik VI. Under Article III, Denmark were able to get ruling geographical claims on Greenland, Iceland and the Faroe Islands. The culmination of significant land claim losses, the dissolution of the union with Norway, and the humiliation of defeat to the United Kingdom and its allies, had severe economic and social impacts on Denmark.  Causes of bankruptcy  Internal = The cost of wartime efforts had a major effect on the Danish economy. In an effort to subsidise the cost of rearmament, the Danish government issued a substantial amount of banknotes. As it stood, the national currency was silver and as a result of excessive issue of banknotes, the former value of silver was lost. The Danish government could not ensure loans from the population were paid, leading to an excessive printing of more money to account for wartime expenditure. Denmark's efforts to prepare for the war economically led to the devaluation of the currency. The Battle of Copenhagen, as painted by alt= The indecisiveness of Frederik VI, the king of Denmark, to not act in the interests of Denmark by remaining loyal to Napoleon and France in 1812, was cause for significant loss of power. As France and her allies were defeated, Denmark surrendered Norway to Sweden and lost claim to significant land claims in North Germany As a result, financial pressure on the currency was increased and not only had great effects on the economy, but led to poverty and a reduction in the quality of life for citizens. = External = Britain's bombardment of Copenhagen in September 1807 ended the neutrality of Denmark in the Napoleon war. Denmark were forced to ally with France, with little military power after losing their naval fleet. The trade embargo on Denmark by Britain coupled with the destruction of the Danish naval fleet saw trade between Norway, Denmark's overseas colony essentially cease. The alliance between Denmark and France was a key reason for the loss of Norway to Sweden in the Treaty of Kiel. Norway was aligned with the economic motives of Great Britain and the loss of trade between Denmark and Norway due to the blockade, saw trade between Norway and Great Britain begin. The decision to join the war along with the effects of the trade embargo meant significant financial burden would be placed on the state to ready for battle as the control of the vital sea lanes was lost.  Effects  Economic = Frederik VI's decision to halt all trade with Britain following on from the bombardment of Copenhagen, negatively affected the import and export market. The Danish timber market was dependent on trade to other European nations and reported a drop of 99% from 1806 to 1808. Throughout the period from 1808‚Äì1813, inflation was rising and in 1813 alone prices rose by some 300 per cent. The central government lost faith in the Danish currency, evidenced by certain taxes being payable by kind (grain) instead of banknotes. The Treaty of Kiel and the loss of geographic claim saw Denmark encounter problems with the circulation of banknotes. As Denmark's total population reduced, this was not met with a reduction in the stock of circulating banknotes, only increasing inflationary effects on the currency. As a result of the war, Denmark was forced to suspend foreign debt and interest payments until 1815. War of the Sixth Coalition, displaying the occupied areas in 1813. Note that as the war progressed, more and more allies of Napoleonic France switched sides and joined the Sixth Coalition. BLUE: French Empire and allies (Kingdom of Italy, Naples, Denmark, Switzerland and French-occupied Spain) RED: Sixth Coalition and allies (Great Britain, Austria (since 12 August), Russia, Prussia (since 17 March), Sweden (since 3 March). = Political = Denmark, before France was defeated by Russia in 1812, were offered permission to side with Britain and its allied forces. This would have reduced the burden that was placed on Denmark following the war and allowed the state to retain claims to land already conquered. Michael Bregnsbo, argues that Frederik VI was loyal to Napoleon, as he believed Napoleon would be the leading figure in the peace proposals if victory was achieved. Historian, Morten Ottosen, argues that the stubbornness of Frederik VI in remaining loyal to Napoleon was foolish and was at the heart of future failures. = Social = The British blockade on Norway and Denmark was having consequences on the entire population. The halting of trade meant employment opportunities stopped as goods were not being made, financial incentives were not either. In response to the bombardment of Copenhagen, King Frederik VI, prohibited all trade and communication with Great Britain in 1807. However, merchants and citizens understood the need for a relaxed prohibition as British goods were valued at a premium. Instances of corruption were widespread as the financial burden of inflation and lower wages took a toll on the population. Civil servants were increasingly being tried for corruption, most commonly, in regards to embezzlement. The betrayal of the King by his civil servants put pressure on the monarchy to instil public confidence in an absolutist rule in order to dispel ideas of democracy.  Economic resolution  One skilling was worth 1/96 of a rigsdaler, the Danish currency Danmarks Nationalbank's former building in 1818, Holmens Kanal in Copenhagen, Denmark = Rigsbanken = On January 5, 1813, the \\"Decree on changing the currency system for the Kingdoms of Denmark and Norway and the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein‚Äù was declared by the Minister for Finance, Ernst Schimmelmann. The Decree stated: The revival of the economy began with the establishment of the Rigsbanken, who were given authority to re-issue banknotes in a new currency, the rigsbankdaler. A compulsory 6% priority mortgage rate was to be paid in silver as well as a 6% interest rate placed on all real estate. The government had requested the donation of silver or currency in the form of a loan to further add strength to the newly established Rigsbanken. This immediate cash inflow became the basis of the Rigsbank's allocation of capital. Remaining banknotes from the Napoleonic wars could be exchanged to the new currency at a ratio of 6:1, a great devaluation of finance. The objective; to cease the issuing of notes until silver and banknotes were interchangeable. = Nationalbanken, 1818 = On 4 July 1818, King Frederik VI enacted Denmarks Nationalbank, authorising the institution to operate as the central bank. The Nationalbank‚Äôs constitution was signed and allowed the bank to have sole handling of the countries issuing of banknotes. It was formed to ensure independence from the government and provide assurance to the Danish people that in future the state would not over issue the currency. The Nationalbank halved the circulation of banknotes between 1818 and 1838, culminating in the restoration of silver and notes being of equal value in 1838. The success of the Nationalbank is grounded in historical power. The institution is today the central bank in Denmark and is attributed with restoring financial trust.  Stabilisation  The work of the Nationalbank and the Rigsbanken eventually stabilised the economy. During the period of bankruptcy, primary education between the ages of seven and fourteen was made compulsory, in an effort to minimise the disparity between the wealthy and peasant citizens, all of which were being effected. In 1838, the circulation of banknotes and silver had reached equality. This meant that debt repayments began and the economy began to return to the once former power it originally held. By reducing the amount of notes in circulation, the Nationalbank was able to allow the convertibility of silver into banknotes by 1845.

His widowed father had one son, James Malloch (born 1873) when he married John Russell's mother, Margaret Stirling, on 30 August 1875. He and several others of his familyMalloch later described his Scottish household as \\"a typical Scottish family of eight, 3 sisters and 5 brothers\\". worked at a textile factory in the area, but he spent his spare time collecting insects in the fields.

The episode is also the 300th produced episode in the overall Stargate franchise. The episode first aired on August 22, 2008 on the Sci Fi Channel in the United States, and subsequently aired on October 23 on Sky1 in the United Kingdom. The episode was nominated for a Nebula Award, and a further four Leo Awards. The episode focuses on Dr. Rodney McKay, who has been infected with a disease known as \\"Second Childhood\\", which is considered the Pegasus equivalent of rapid-onset Alzheimer's disease, where he quickly reverts to a childlike state. The only way for the team to save him is to send him to a shrine on the planet of Talus, which has since turned into a Wraith outpost. Plot Jeannie Miller, Rodney McKay's sister, comes to Atlantis when she learns her brother has been infected with a mysterious disease known as the \\"Second Childhood\\", the Pegasus equivalent of rapid-onset Alzheimer's disease. The Expedition gives Jeannie a chance to say goodbye; Rodney has already regressed to a childlike state and all attempts at medical intervention have failed. Jennifer Keller explains that McKay became infected with the Second Childhood parasite at some point over the past two weeks, and that she misinterpreted the first symptoms when they appeared after a mission to M44-5YN. The subsequent deterioration of McKay's mind is shown through a series of flashbacks and self-made video recordings. Keller blames herself for not catching the disease sooner, but refuses to give up even as McKay has only a few days left to live. Ronon Dex proposes an alternative: a shrine on the planet Talus that grants those afflicted with the Second Childhood a single day of mental clarity, followed by a quick death. Jeannie overrules Keller's wishes and asks that McKay be brought to the planet. Despite the fact that the planet has become a Wraith stronghold, Richard Woolsey reluctantly approves the mission. The team reaches the shrine in a puddle jumper, where McKay miraculously returns to normal. Keller determines that the shrine is emitting dangerous radiation that is causing the parasite to shrink so as to protect itself. As the parasite would rapidly and fatally re-expand were McKay to leave the shrine, and they cannot retrieve medical supplies from Atlantis due to the Wraith, Keller operates on him inside the shrine using improvised tools. Once she drills into McKay's skull, the parasite leaves to escape the radiation, and is destroyed by Ronon. At the end of the episode, Keller watches one of McKay's video diary entries, where McKay confesses his love for her, putting a smile on her face. Production Since Stargate SG-1 produced 214 episodes, and this episode is the 86th produced from Stargate Atlantis, this makes \\"The Shrine\\" the 300th episode produced in the Stargate franchise. When writer Brad Wright was asked to write this episode, he originally came up with two ideas, \\"The Shrine\\", and \\"The Replacements\\", which was meant to be an episode about where Sheppard's team went missing for six months, and finally returned to see completely different crew in the Atlantis Expedition. However, since the cast change from Amanda Tapping (Samantha Carter) to Robert Picardo (Richard Woolsey) from the beginning of the season, the idea for \\"The Replacement\\" was dropped, and Wright went with \\"The Shrine\\". The working title of the episode was \\"The Shrine of Talus\\", but was changed to \\"The Shrine\\", due to clearance issues with releasing the title. The final draft of the script was completed around 10 March 2008. Filming for the episode took place on the week starting on 22 April. The episode's writer, Brad Wright was somewhat inspired by the Daniel Keyes novel, Flowers for Algernon for the plot of the episode. The episode mainly focused on David Hewlett's character, Rodney McKay. Hewlett's real-life sister, Kate Hewlett made an appearance as Jeannie Miller, McKay's sister. This episode was the fourth to star Kate Hewlett's character. David Nykl was credited as his role of Radek Zelenka. However, by the time of the finished product, all of his scenes were cut out. Zelenka was, however, mentioned in a scene, and despite having all his scenes cut, he was seen for a few seconds, walking past the camera, where the Czech flag was clearly visible from his arm. Reception \\"The Shrine\\" received a 1.2 household ratings (1.6 million viewers) from Nielsen ratings, which is considered average for the season so far. The episode was however, beaten by Eureka with 1.8, Ghost Hunters International with 1.6, and ECW on Syfy with 1.5, making \\"The Shrine\\" the fourth most viewed show on Syfy for that week. On Sky One, the episode received viewing figures of 497,000, which was the third most watched TV programme for the channel that week. IGN had given the episode a rating of 9.2 out of 10, which is considered outstanding. Tony Ireland Mell, the reviewer, praised the episode for numerous reasons, including the depth of Hewlett's character, through the day-by-day progression of McKay's video diary. In 2009, Brad Wright's script for \\"The Shrine\\" was nominated for a Nebula Award, alongside The Dark Knight and Wall-E. It was also nominated for four Leo Awards in its upcoming 2009 show. The four nominations include \\"Best Screenwriting in a Dramatic Series\\" (nominated to Wright), \\"Best Cinematography in a Dramatic Series\\" (nominated to Jim Menard), \\"Best Picture Editing in a Dramatic Series\\" (nominated to Brad Rines) and \\"Best Lead Performance by a Male in a Dramatic Series\\" (nominated to David Hewlett).

Cameroon's first protected area in the northern part of the country was established in 1932 by the colonial administration of French Cameroon. The first forest reserve created was the Mozogo Gokoro Reserve on 12 June 1932 and the second in the same year was the Benue Reserve on 19 November 1932. The third reserve, the Waza Reserve was established on 24 March 1934, initially covering an area of which was extended in 1935 to cover ; this is one of the most popular reserves in the country. Cameroon became independent in 1960, and the national government retained the country's system of protected areas, and designated new ones. Until 1975, there were 9 protected areas with greater focus on the north than the south. Following the Earth Summit of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil in 1992, the number of protected areas increased substantially and were well distributed covering all the ten provinces of the country in widely differing topographic, climatic, hydrological and biological conditions. There are 20 protected reserves which include national parks, zoos, forest reserves and sanctuaries.
