All Saints' Church is the only elliptical church building in England, the third tallest religious building in Newcastle and the ninth-tallest structure in the city overall. It is a Grade I listed building. History =The old church= A Christian church stood here in 1286, and here continued to stand, of course undergoing many changes and restorations between times, until the end of the eighteenth century, when it was pulled down, and the present church built. The original All Saints', or All Hallows', was built in the Gothic style. Its appearance is thus described by Henry Bourne: > This church is seated upon a hill, which is much about the same height with > the situation of St. Mary’s, in Gateshead, and upon the same line with it. > It is not so long as St. Nicholas, being only 55 yards 1 foot a quarter > long, but it is broader, as being 25 yards 2 feet broad. The steeple is but > a mean height being a square tower, with only one spire arising from it. The > bells belonging to this church were founded in 1696. They were cast out of > the metal of that famous statue of King James the Second which stood on the > Sandhill. They were founded in the ground belonging to St Austin Friars, in > that part of it which is in the back of the Hospital of the Holy Jesus. > Their sound is not so melodious as the others in this town, but the note is > exceedingly exact, and more tuneful than the others. McKenzie, who was living when the old church was pulled down, and when much public interest was taken in it, gives in his history an interesting account, from which we gather that the steeple and west end occupied the site of the present church. The church extended further east over what is now the burial ground. The steeple was a low, square, inelegant tower, supported by buttresses at the corners of the west side, and terminated by large embrasures. From the centre rose a small square turret, surmounted by a short spire, terminated with a gilt vane. The principal entrance into the church was the west door of the steeple which corresponded in size with the west door of St Nicholas's. Above it was a large and beautiful Gothic window. There were also a north and south porch, the former leading into Silver Street, the latter into Pilgrim Street. The steeple contained a good clock, with chimes and two painted dials. The five bells were cast by Christopher Hodgson of London. There were seven chantries; one of them – St Peter's – being founded by Roger Thornton. The windows of the old church were large and ornamented with stained glass, but they were greatly damaged at the time of the civil war. But the finest monument in the church was, fittingly, that erected to the munificent \\"Patron of Newcastle\\", Roger Thornton. Brand gives an illustration of it, and Mackenzie describes it thus \\"It consisted of an altar, the front of which was enriched with beautiful gothic compartments and armorial bearings, over which rose an elliptic canopy, surmounted by a spiral arch rising in the centre and terminated with a tower, the crest of the Thornton family. The whole was included in a wall with a semi-octagonal tower at each end and embrasures along the top. On this part of the monument was the representation of two small figures supporting the family arms. But the principal ornament of this monument was the large brass plate which covered the top of the altar, on which were beautifully engraved the figures of Roger Thornton and Agnes his wife, with numerous effigies of the apostles and saints, many of them with the symbols of their martyrdom. The beautiful monument is now gone, but the brass is still preserved and hangs in the vestry. In 1841 the vicar of the church, the Rev. R. Green, had it cleaned, repaired, and fitted into the wood frame in which it now hangs.\\" This memorial brass has now been installed behind the altar of St Nicholas's Cathedral in Newcastle. A very interesting feature of the church was the seamen's porch, and gallery on the north side, built by the Master and Brethren of the nearby Trinity House, Newcastle in 1618. The front of the gallery was decorated with painted panels. The centre one bore the arms of Trinity House, and on the side panels were depicted four scriptural subjects, all most appropriately being connected with the sea. Connected with the font of the old church is the name of a Newcastle worthy which deserves to be recorded. When the Scots entered the town in 1640 they commenced, in their fanatical zeal against Popery, to deface the religious monuments. Beginning at St John's, the first object sacrificed was, naturally, the font which stood in the porch. One Cuthbert Maxwell, a stonemason of Newcastle, seeing this, ran in haste to St Nicholas’ and All Saints’, and hid the fonts of these churches before the Scots had time to reach them. After the Restoration he set them up again, and thus to Cuthbert Maxwell we owe the preservation of the beautiful font of St Nicholas. Concerning that belonging to All Saints’ the font thus saved was octagonal in shape, and carved with armorial bearings. At the demolition of the church it was given to Alderman Hugh Hornby, that enthusiastic collector of antiquities who built the carved stones from Tyne Bridge towers into the wall of his garden in Pilgrim Street. Of the early history of old All Saints' there are few records except accounts of repairs. We hear of the assembly of the “Four-and-Twenty”, and of the “Ancients of the Parish” – for the purpose of considering needful repairs, and of levying cesses for carrying them out. The parish register commences in 1600. =The new church= About 1785 the churchwardens procured plans and estimates for the restoration of the building from William Newton, of Newcastle; but Dr Sharp, the Archdeacon of Northumberland, objected to the proposed design of shortening the chancel, and thus altering the form of an old Gothic church. Two other architects, David Stephenson and John Dodds, were called in, and they reported that it was impossible to give an estimate for restoring the church, as so many unforeseen circumstances might crop up. They reported, \\"That this decayed building cannot be repaired but at as much expense as building a new one. If one part is taken down the rest will follow.\\" It appeared that \\"the south wall was in danger of falling by the pressure of the roof; one of the pillars of the steeple had considerably shrunk, and the steeple itself inclined to the south. The stone of the groined arches under the bells was decayed, the timber and bells in great danger of falling in, the stone in several windows decayed, the walls were rotten, and the lime had lost its cement and become almost dust\\". On Easter Tuesday (18 April 1786) a general meeting of the parishioners was held, and they resolved unanimously to erect a new church. The work of destroying the old one proceeded immediately and, unfortunately, most of its old monuments, windows, and other interesting relics were not preserved; they either perished or were carried away during the operations. It was found necessary to blast with gunpowder the masonry of the tower, so tenacious was the mortar binding it, and while doing so a sad accident occurred, by which a well-known inhabitant of the town lost his life. This was Captain William Hedley, who was killed by one of the stones of the great west door falling upon him while he was standing watching the work of destruction. He was greatly respected in Newcastle, and well known abroad as the hero of a deed of humanity and daring, in saving a child from drowning in Bordeaux harbour. His conduct on that occasion was praised highly in the French newspapers. The whole of the old church having at length been taken down, the construction of the new one was commenced with. The design of David Stephenson had been selected, and the foundation stone was laid on 14 August 1786 by the Rev. James Stephen Lushington, Vicar of Newcastle. In proceeding with the building the original design was departed from in two important points. The portico, which was to have had a colonnade of Ionic columns along the south front, was altered to the present Doric design, and the money thus saved was devoted to the improvement of the tower. According to the original design, the latter was to have consisted of \\"a plain octagonal tower, of uniform width, rising from the arch on which the present spire stands to the height of thirty-seven and a-half feet, and terminating with a semicircular dome twelve feet in diameter, making a total height of one hundred and forty- three feet from the ground. The tame and spiritless appearance of the model, however, happily caused its rejection. A model of the present handsome and superior design was exhibited to the trustees in August 1790, and finally adopted on the 12th of September following.\\" The new church was finished in 1796, and its cost was £27,000, the whole being obtained by assessment of the parish, except £2061.19s raised by the sale of pews, £30 by donations, and £100 given by Mrs Atlee for the additional expense of making the internal fittings of mahogany instead of oak. The church is built in the form of an ellipse, the longer diameter of which runs nearly north and south. It is in form like the Pantheon at Rome. The roof, without any supporting pillars, is a splendid piece of carpentry. It was first put together in the yard at the Austin Friars, where the bells of the old church were cast. The square tower on which the steeple stands is at the south end, and the interior forms the vestibule. On either side of it there is a wing – that on the left being used as a morning chapel and for baptisms, and that on the right as the vestry where hung the monumental brass of Roger Thornton, now moved to Newcastle Cathedral. On Tuesday, 17 November 1789, the new church was consecrated by the Right Rev. Thomas Thurlow, Lord Bishop of Durham, and the opening sermon was preached by the Rev. Hugh Moises, morning lecturer of All Saints’ and head- master of the Grammar School. His text was from Leviticus xix: 30: Ye shall keep My Sabbaths and reverence My sanctuary. I am the Lord. In 1881 the churchwardens called the public attention to the state of the church, and appealed for help to remedy it. Subscriptions were gathered in and the work of restoration was vigorously proceeded with. About the end of 1881 Richard S. Donkin of Campville, North Shields, a wealthy shipowner, whose place of business was close by the old church, made a handsome offer to improve the graveyard at his own expense. This offer was thankfully accepted by the parishioners, and early in 1882 the work was proceeded with. Many other generous gifts were at the same time made to the church, but we will only mention one more, that of the presentation of the new clock by Mr John Hall, another Newcastle merchant. It was formally set going and illuminated on the evening of 3 February 1882. On the occasion an address was presented to Mr Hall by Mr Joseph Cowen, M.P. for the town, on behalf of the people of the parish. In presenting this address Mr Cowen, standing on the steps of the church, made a speech to the assembled people who crowded below to the number of about ten thousand. Recent history The church was deconsecrated in 1961, and converted to offices/auditorium in 1983-84 as the Town Teacher initiative. It was then used by the Royal Northern Sinfonia before their move across the river to The Sage, Gateshead in 2004. The church was for a while used by the Church of Saint Willibrord with All Saints, a member of The Old Catholic Church Anglican Diocese. It has also hosted musical events. Following flooding damage caused by blocked roof drains over the 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 winters, the building was left in a state of semi-disrepair. In 2015 it was placed on Historic England's Heritage at Risk register. In 2019, the local congregation of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church in England and Wales signed a 150-year lease for All Saints. After a comprehensive restoration project, worship services as All Saints' Presbyterian Church began in October, 2019. The minister is Dr Bill Schweitzer and in addition to two Sunday services the church runs a mid-week Bible study and a weekly Asian Fellowship meeting in Urdu.

It originally aired on March 22, 2010. Plot It is Lily's 32nd birthday, and, as one who really loves her own birthday, she wakes herself up at midnight for the sole purpose of announcing that it is officially her birthday before falling asleep once again. Later in the morning, Marshall brings her breakfast in bed with its own theme, Spanish Interlude, complete with a guitarist and a picture of the \\"lyrical rolling hills of northern Spain (Alozaina, Málaga)\\" in the window. One of Lily's first presents to be opened is a new digital camera with naked pictures of Marshall inside. As she enjoys taking pictures all the time, Barney and Robin cringe as they remember all of the group shots Lily took over the years and the situations that happened before the pictures were taken. Ted arrives at the door with his new girlfriend, Amanda, who has volunteered to bake Lily's cake, which upsets Lily and Marshall. The group plays parlor games designed to test their knowledge of Lily, but Amanda does not know anything about her. Lily gathers the gang together for their annual group photo while Amanda prepares the birthday cake in the kitchen, in an attempt to take the photo without Amanda. Ted objects, so Lily brings out a photo album showing pictures from past events where Ted has brought his dates along and says that Ted's dates always ruin the occasion. Lily challenges Ted to name them, but he fails to remember a single one. Robin notices that Barney's pose is exactly the same in all of the photographs. Barney explains that he never takes a bad picture. He compares and contrasts his photo presence with Marshall's; while Barney always looks \\"drop dead, stone cold amazing\\", Marshall \\"just looks dead, stoned, and cold\\". Robin tries to take candid pictures of Barney, but is shocked to see his usual pose in all the pictures. Ted calls Lily a \\"birthday brat\\", not understanding why she is so upset over ruining \\"a couple of pictures\\". Lily reminds him of their trip to Paris: It was initially reserved for only her and Marshall, but Ted came along with Karen. Karen and Ted got in a fight and broke up before the plane landed. Karen's presence in Paris ruined the whole trip. Ted apologizes for always ruining their group shots, but explains that he's always trying to find \\"The One\\". Robin admits not inviting Don because some of the gang's important events are not ideal to bring new friends. Ted notes that Robin is Lily's best friend, but she began as one of Ted's \\"random skanks\\", Lily countering that Robin is the \\"skanky exception to the skanky rule\\". Ted accepts that Amanda does not have to be in the group photo, but asks Lily to give her a chance. When Amanda reveals the birthday cake, which reads \\"Happy 42nd Birthday, Lori\\", while Lily is merely amused, Marshall gets angry and kicks Amanda out of the apartment. Marshall explains he has become cynical because every time Ted breaks up with a girl, Marshall is there to pick up the pieces and console the girl. Ted comments that all of the photos in Lily's photo album show no signs of the fights and disagreements that happened only moments before they were taken. Lily turns the page to the first photo that she, Marshall, and Ted had taken together back in college, a result of Ted inviting her into the picture because he believed that her and Marshall's relationship would last. Lily apologizes to Ted and agrees to call back Amanda. When the time comes for the group photo, Robin tricks Barney into removing his suit jacket just before the picture is taken, but the finished product shows Barney in his usual pose, much to Robin's dismay. At Lily's 33rd birthday, Lily asks Ted to identify Amanda in the photo album, but he cannot remember her name. As they gather for the group photo, Robin offers Barney some dip. Barney realizes too late the dip contains cilantro, which he is allergic to, and begins to sneeze. Finally, Robin catches Barney in a compromising position for a bad photograph. Critical response Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club rated the episode a B+. Amanda Sloane Murray of IGN gave the episode 7.8 out of 10. Joel Keller of TV Squad was less impressed, describing the episode as \\"half-baked\\". He wrote that the main premise needed to be explored further, that the B stories were underdeveloped, and that the episode left him dissatisfied. Vlada Gelman of the Los Angeles Times enjoyed seeing an episode where the whole group was together in the same room, nicely tied together with flashbacks and flashforwards. Gelman suggests Lily just needs to learn to use the \\"skank removal tool\\" in Photoshop. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger was quoted saying: > I have to say, though, that the Marshall-with-his-eyes-closed running gag > was funnier before the episode started calling attention to it.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Solway, the archdeaconry of West Cumberland, and the diocese of Carlisle. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. History The church dates from the later part of the 11th century, with additions and alterations in the 12th and 13th centuries. The south aisle was re-built in the about 1323 as a chantry for the rector, Thomas de Burgh. Restoration of the church was carried out between 1864 and 1876 by William Butterfield; this included adding the east window and the south windows of the chancel, and the saddleback roof on the tower. The timber roofs of the nave and chancel also date from this restoration. Fletcher Christian, leader of the Mutiny on the Bounty, was baptised in the church on the day of his birth in 1764. Architecture =Exterior= St Bridget's is constructed in calciferous sandstone ashlar, and has a green slate roof. Its plan consists of a three-bay nave with a south aisle and south porch, and a two-bay chancel with a north vestry. At the west end is a three-storey tower with a saddleback roof, and at the ends of the gables are cross finials. The church contains elements of Norman, Gothic and Gothic Revival architecture. The Norman features include a blocked doorway in the north wall, and the arcade between the nave and the south aisle. The ground floor of the tower is tunnel-vaulted. Medieval cross slabs have been incorporated in the north wall and in the blocked west door. =Interior= Both the nave and the chancel have painted timber roofs. The south aisle contains a piscina, a sedilia, and a recess for the tomb of Thomas de Burgh, who died in 1348. In the church are pieces of carved stone; these include an Anglo-Danish cross-socket, and fragments dating from the pre-Norman period. The east window contains stained glass depicting the Ascension, designed by Alexander Gibbs, and is a memorial to Rev John Wordsworth, son of William Wordsworth, who was vicar of the church for 40 years. On each side of the east window are niches for statues. There is more glass by Gibbs in other windows, dating from 1865, and glass elsewhere by Cox & Buckley and Sons, from 1870. The font dates either from the 13th century or possibly from the 17th century. The two-manual organ was built in 1895 by W. Hill and Son of London. External features In the churchyard is a red sandstone sundial dated 1684. It has a square shaft, the head is weathered and the gnomon is missing. The sundial is a Grade II listed structure. The churchyard also contains many carved gravestones from the 17th to the 19th centuries, and the table tomb of Fletcher Christian's father Charles.Alexander, Caroline (2003).

It is north-west of Berwick-upon-Tweed, in the former county of Berwickshire. Built around a medieval tower house, the present castle dates largely from the 19th century. Ayton Castle is the caput of the feudal barony of Ayton. The castle is protected as a category A listed building, and the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the national listing of significant parks and gardens. History The original castle, a peel tower, had once been a stronghold of the Home family. This castle was captured by the English in 1497, and the nearby church was the scene of the subsequent negotiation of the treaty of Ayton, signed on 30 September 1497. The tower was replaced by a classical mansion, which burnt down in 1834. The estate was subsequently purchased by William Mitchell (later Mitchell-Innes) of Parsonsgreen, Edinburgh, who had been born at Belhelvie, Aberdeenshire, in 1778. William Mitchell was Chief Cashier of the Royal Bank of Scotland from 1808 to 1827. After inheriting the Parsonsgreen estate, he was an extraordinary director of the bank, 1840–1841. After further inheriting the Stow estates from a distant cousin, he hyphenated his surname and is found as William Mitchell-Innes of Parsonsgreen, an ordinary director of the bank, 1841-1853. Between these latter dates he acquired the Ayton estate, and he is recorded as William Mitchell-Innes of Ayton Castle, an ordinary director 1853-1859. Ayton Castle and grounds. In 1851 William Mitchell-Innes commissioned James Gillespie Graham to build a new castle at Ayton in the Scottish Baronial style in red sandstone. In 1860 architect David Bryce extended the drawing room and added a billiard room, with further additions in 1864-7 by James Maitland Wardrop. Extensive interior redecoration was carried out in 1875 by Bonnar & Carfrae, still largely extant, with stencilled imitation silk damask. In addition to the elaborate offices and stables block, all in red sandstone, Ayton Castle boasts a beehive type sixteenth century dovecote, restored in 1745 and 2015, and a magnificent South Lodge in Scots Baronial with archway and screen walls in red sandstone. Mention must be made of the visit to the castle in 1873 by Mark Twain who insisted upon buying the Dining Room fireplace mantel; it is now in the Mark Twain House & Museum in Hartford, Connecticut, having been repaired and moved there after a fire that destroyed Twain's Stormfield villa where it had been installed.https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/amerstud/article/viewFile/2119/2078 Pearson, Norman, \\"The Mark Twain Memorial in Hartford, Connecticut,\\" American Studies, Vol. 1, No. 2: Fall 1960. Retrieved 2014-05-14. The present castle fireplace dates from that occurrence. Following William Mitchell-Innes's death at the castle in January 1860, it passed to his eldest son and heir, Alexander Mitchell-Innes of Ayton and Whitehall (near Chirnside) (1811–1886), a Deputy Lieutenant and Justice of the Peace for Berwickshire. He continued the family's building works at Ayton by commissioning James Maitland Wardrop to build a new parish church with a spire, and stained glass windows by Ballantine & Sons. Alexander Mitchell-Innes married (1) Charlotte (1818–1848), daughter of Sir Thomas Dick Lauder of Fountainhall, 7th Bt. She died in childbirth having their sixth child. He remarried (2) Fanny Augusta (1821–1902) daughter of James Vine, in Puckaster, Isle of Wight. They had a further nine children. Inevitably there were inheritance disputes. Strangely, Alexander Harold Mitchell-Innes of Ayton & Whitehall was served heir of entail to his grandfather, Alexander Mitchell-Innes of Ayton & Whitehall, on 21 November 1892. In 1895 he sold the barony of Ayton, its castle and lands, for £90,000 to Henry Liddell-Grainger of Middleton Hall, Northumberland (1856–1905). Alexander Mitchell-Innes had apparently shared his entire estate with his very large family and they were accordingly all paid out following the sale of Ayton Castle. The family retained Millbank House and grounds, not far from the castle, as well as the now-derelict Whitehall Manor, near Chirnside.

Life  Marcel Lang was born in Basel into a family in which the East European Jewish tradition of chazanut (cantorial art) was cultivated. After first training as a commercial clerk, he studied singing with Kurt Widmer and Hans Riediker at the Music Academy of Basel and the affiliated opera studio. After qualifying as a singing teacher, he studied at the Zurich Institute of Applied Psychology. In his capacity as a certified psychologist, Marcel Lang acted as a consultant to companies and advised clients. He worked as psychological advisor at the Music Academy of Basel and taught psychopedagogy at the College of Music in Basel. Beginning in the late 1970s, Marcel Lang was the cantor in the Jewish community of Zürich (Israelitische Cultusgemeinde Zürich (ICZ)) and in a number of small synagogues. From 1982 until 1991 he was senior cantor at the Jewish community in Basel. He then worked as the permanent guest cantor in the Jewish community of Düsseldorf before returning to the Jewish community in Zurich in 2004. In addition, he performed in concerts and worked as a teacher. He appeared both as a solo performer of synagogal music and Yiddish songs and as a singer of classical lieder, operas and oratorios. His concerts took him throughout Europe and to North America, Australia and Israel. He produced a number of CDs featuring recordings of Yiddish songs and synagogal music accompanied by choirs, piano, chamber ensembles and klezmer bands. As a teacher he prepared students for their bar mitzvah over a period of 30 years. A connoisseur of Jewish song, prayer-leading and liturgy, he taught, advised and supported groups and individuals. Among other things, he worked at the Institute for Jewish Studies in Heidelberg as an instructor of “chazanut” and, from 1999, introduced members of the Jewish-pluralist Basel association “Ofek” to the liturgical structure of prayer-leading. He imparted his expert knowledge of Ashkenazi song culture and Yiddish songs on numerous lecture tours. With his knowledge and love of both orthodox and liberal Judaism, Marcel Lang felt at home in the various streams of Judaism throughout his life. He demonstrated this as cantor in the Jewish communities in Basel and Zurich, which are confronted with a heterogeneous membership, and in the Jewish community in Düsseldorf, which has seen many Jews from the former Soviet Union who did not enjoy a Jewish education joining its ranks. Marcel Lang was also active in inter-religious dialogue. He introduced many young people to Judaism as part of their preparation for confirmation and presented Jewish religious practice in tours of the Basel synagogue and in lectures throughout German-speaking Switzerland.

Part of the Bougainville campaign, the raid involved a landing by a battalion-sized force of United States Marines to harass Imperial Japanese Army troops on Bougainville Island. The raid was a failure for the Americans as they were attacked by a larger-than-expected Japanese force and as a result the Marines were withdrawn from the beachhead without having achieved any of their objectives. Background On 1 November 1943, US forces had landed around Cape Torokina as part of the Allied advance north through the Solomon Islands towards the Japanese strong hold around Rabaul, on New Britain, as part of Operation Cartwheel. After establishing a perimeter around the beachhead, the US commander, Major General Roy Geiger, decided to expand the perimeter to include a ridge of hills away, ordered an eastward advance towards the Torokina River, aimed at establishing a series of defense lines. Following the Battle of Piva Forks, which had secured defense line \\"Easy\\", further plans were formulated. Soldiers from the 37th Infantry Division would advance to defense line \\"How\\", while the 3rd Marine Division was to secure inland defense line codenamed \\"Fox\\". The Marines' advance was to proceed on 26 November. In order to protect the general advance from any surprise Japanese attack on the right flank, and to cut off Japanese reinforcements, Geiger planned a raid at Koiari (\\"Napoi\\" in Japanese sources),Tanaka 1980, p. 257. down the coast from Cape Torokina, to detect enemy troop movements, destroy enemy supply dumps and disrupt their line of communications. The raiders were to harass enemy units as far inland as the East–West trail but avoid any decisive engagement with major Japanese forces.Shaw, et al. 1963, pp. 270–272. Location of Koiari on Bougainville The 1st Parachute Battalion, 1st Marine Parachute Regiment, under the command of Major Richard Fagan, which had just arrived from Vella Lavella, was assigned to be the main force, with 'M' Company of the 3rd Marine Raider Battalion and a forward observer team from the 12th Marine Regiment attached.Gailey 1991, p.113. However, due to delays the raid was put back until the 29 November. Covering fire for the landing, which had been planned to be provided by destroyers, was now not available due to orders previously issued. A preliminary reconnaissance landing was undertaken in darkness on 27 November and reported no enemy activity in the area. A boat reconnoitered the beach landing site prior to the landing on 28 November and also reported no enemy activity. The Japanese troops defending the area were from Lieutenant General Masatane Kanda's 6th Division, with the infantry forming a detachment known as the Iwasa Detachment under the command of Major General Shun Iwasa.Miller 1959, p. 328; Tanaka 1980, p. 255. Raid The 1st Parachute Battalion was transported by United States Navy LCMs and LCVPs landing craft, landing ashore at Koiari at 04:00 hours on 29 November. The landing occurred adjacent to a Japanese supply dump. The Marines overran the supply dump and hastily dug in yards inland, amidst heavy mortar, machine gun and rifle fire from defending Japanese. Meanwhile, 'M' Company of the 3rd Marine Raider Battalion and HQ Company were landed further south.Gailey 1991, p.114. In order to repel the landing, troops from the Japanese 6th Transport Regiment and elements of the 23rd Infantry Regiment, launched a number of infantry charges which caused significant casualties amongst the US forces. Close-in support fire was provided by 155 mm guns of the 3rd Defense Battalion firing from their gun lines around Cape Torokina under the control of the forward observation teams. A captured 37 mm field gun was also used against the Japanese.Hoffman 1995, p.1. Experiencing heavier-than-expected resistance, it became clear to the US commanders that the raiders were outnumbered. With an estimated 1,200 Japanese in the immediate vicinity, the US raiding force faced annihilation. The second landing party that had been landed further south met up with the main party at 09:30 hours, having suffered 13 casualties while moving north. Realizing the futility of the situation and believing that he no longer possessed freedom of action having been decisively engaged, Fagan sent a request over the radio for evacuation. Geiger concurred and ordered the Marines to be withdrawn, although a communications failure resulted in this message not getting through to Fagan.Rentz 1946, p. 75. Two attempts were made to extract them by landing craft, although these failed due to heavy Japanese artillery fire. With their backs to the sea and ammunition running low amongst the troops on the beach, an LCI gunboat and the destroyers , , and , which had been ordered back from convoy escort duties, closed in to the beach at 18:00 hours, and--in concert with shore based artillery and air support--provided a barrage that allowed rescue craft to remove the raiding group from the beach; the last boat left the area at 20:40 hours under the cover of darkness. Aftermath None of the objectives of the raid were achieved and the raid was a failure with 15 killed or died of wounds, 99 wounded and 7 missing. It was estimated that the Japanese had lost between 145 and 291 men. Again the lack of preliminary naval and artillery bombardment proved to be important in the outcome of the engagement.Gailey 1991, p.115. In the aftermath of the raid, US plans to expand the perimeter around Torokina went ahead with units of the 3rd Marine Division advancing towards the Torokina River throughout early December, as part of a plan to occupy the high ground west of the river.Rentz 1946, pp. 80–82. This advance would see the Marines take part in a series of engagements around Hellzapoppin Ridge and Hill 600A in mid- December.Rentz 1946, pp. 83–87. In December, US Army troops from Major General Oscar Griswold's XIV Corps had arrived to relieve the Marines around the perimeter.Rentz 1946, p. 90. After this, there were no major actions around the US perimeter until March 1944, when the Japanese launched a strong counterattack that was turned back with heavy casualties.James 2012, p. 155 Following the defeat of the Japanese counterattack, a lull period followed until late 1944 when Australian forces arrived to relieve the American troops who were transferred to the Philippines. The Australians subsequently undertook a series of advances across the island, which saw them clear the central sector and push north towards the Bonis Peninsula and south towards Buin.Keogh 1965, pp. 414–421 Notes References   * * Category:Conflicts in 1943 Category:1943 in Papua New Guinea Category:Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II Category:South West Pacific theatre of World War II Category:Battles of World War II involving Japan Category:Battles of World War II involving the United States Category:United States Marine Corps in World War II Category:Autonomous Region of Bougainville Category:Battles and operations of World War II involving Papua New Guinea Category:November 1943 events ","title":"Raid on Koiari"},{"id":"26667412","text":"Eucosmomorpha albersana is a moth of the family Tortricidae.

Notable albums include 1961's In Fiesta (Teichiku Japan), which included a version of Benny Golson's \\"Five Spot After Dark\\". Performers on the album included Hidehiko Matsumoto on tenor and flute and Yuzuru Sera on piano. 1965's Sakura Sakura united the quintet (including Terumasa Hino on trumpet) with three female koto players as Shiraki moved into a world jazz approach. An invited November 1965 performance at the Berlin Jazz Festival, organised by Joachim-Ernst Berendt, saw the quintet work with a koto quartet and was feted for mixing jazz with traditional Japanese music.The return of jazz: Joachim- Ernst Berendt and West German cultural change by Andrew Wright Hurley He also played with Toshiko Akiyoshi, including two tracks on her 1961 album Toshiko Meets Her Old Pals.

Similarly, tongfu () is another neologism for men who have married lesbian women. Liu Dalin, among the first sexologists in Mainland China, estimates that 90% of gay Chinese men marry a heterosexual woman, while in the United States, only 15-20% of gay men do so. Sexologist and sociologist Li Yinhe (李银河) believes there are 20 million male homosexuals in China, 80% of whom marry a woman. Gay Chinese men are under social pressure to marry and produce a male heir to continue the family line, as Confucianism places a strong emphasis on this. Etymology The word combines tong from 同性戀 (tongxinglian, homosexuality) or 同志 (tongzhi, a slang for gay) with qi (\\"wife\\").Similarly, tongfu () combines tong with fu (\\"husband\\"). Life as Tongqi Very few of the women who enter into these marriages are aware that their spouses are gay. Many women have turned to social media because it allows them to maintain anonymity while expressing their feelings about being married to gay men. The majority of these women worry more about the social stigma of being divorced in Chinese society than they do about being in a loveless marriage. For the men, the shame of being stigmatized as homosexual causes them to enter these marriages in the first place. In addition to the emotional toll of being married to a man who does not desire them physically, nearly 90% of these women suffer physical abuse and \\"sexual apathy\\" from their husbands. Many women who are married to gay men in China are dependent on the men for financial survival. Even with a divorce, they can be left with social and financial hardships. Only 31.2% of tongqi marriages end in divorce, according to a recent survey. Divorce laws in China do not allow women to seek a dissolution of marriage from their husbands if they are gay. Changes A lot of these women are speaking out against China's policy against same sex marriage beyond chat rooms. Recently, tongqi have been seen marching in Hong Kong's gay rights parade to bring visibility to their plight. A new trend among Chinese gay men and lesbian is arrangements called cooperation marriages, where they marry each other publicly while living with a same sex partner in private. There are services which are available to assist in the matching of gay men to lesbians for the purposes of marriage. Research has been conducted about the plight of tongqi by the Harbin Institute of Technology for the first time that encourages the acceptance of gays, to reduce the number of women subjected to these marriages.

In 2004 Brodskaya moved from Moscow to UK where she continued her education in art, at the University of Hertfordshire. She was graduated with a master of art in graphics communication degree in 2006. Brodskaya started working as a freelance graphic designer, but she very quickly switched to the illustration field and became known for her innovative method of working with edge-glued strips of paper. However, the graphic design background has an influence on her artwork as most of the initial pieces have a strong typographic focus: “Typography is my second love, after paper and I’m really happy that I’ve found a way of combining the two. Having said that, I don’t want to exclude non-typobased designs, I’d like to work on different projects.”. Much of Brodskaya’s work uses an old technique called Quilling, in which ribbons of paper are used to create intricate designs; however she takes it to an entirely new level. She has swiftly earned an international reputation for her innovative paper illustrations and was named the ‘breakthrough star’ of the 2009 by Creative Review. She’s honed her skill since then, constantly challenging herself to find new ways to practice quilling with subjects ranging from typography to portraiture. Paper quilling has seen a resurgence over the last few years, and it’s arguably thanks to the handiwork of Brodskaya Brodskaya. When describing her paper art works Brodskaya says she is drawing with paper instead of on it. Her work for g2 (The Guardian) was included in D&AD; Annual for 2009. She also designed one of the Google Chrome themes. In 2015 Brodskaya designed an official poster for The Wimbledon Championships. The following year, she created a large paper artwork for the Wimbledon Clubhouse. She created a Forever® stamp design for United States Postal Service for release during 2016. She also created a set of Christmas 2017 stamps for New Zealand Post. She was featured among other leading UK- based artists in the BBC programme Making Art Work: First Idea to Final Piece.

The Scimitar was published weekly upon its debut on July 11, 1914, but became a bi-weekly from June 15, 1915, until the paper's close in November 1917. In modern sources, the Scimitar is remembered most often in connection to its stance on the lynching of wealthy African-American landowner and Abbeville resident Anthony Crawford in October 1916, and the related statements and editorials it published about the event, in which the paper unabashedly endorsed the lynching and opposed the criminal prosecution of the men responsible for the act. Some historians have claimed that the output of the Scimitar offered the most frank appraisal of lynching, explicitly defining it as a tool of racist oppression by whites, rather than cloaking it in euphemism, as was typical for most contemporary newspaper accounts of lynchings. Regarding the incident, and lynching in general, Beard wrote in the Scimitar: \\"Know that when white men cease to whip or kill negroes who become obnoxious, that they will take advantage of the laxity, and soon make this state untenable for whites of all kinds.\\" In 1917, the paper vehemently opposed United States involvement in World War I, often on similarly racist grounds. In numerous editorials, William Beard wrote that white men were obligated to oppose the war, because of the challenge it posed to white supremacy, specifically how white enlisted men might theoretically ever have to salute a black officer, and how this might affect the relations between the two once the war was over. In one typical editorial on the subject, Beard mused \\"I wonder if the old pine tree at the baseball park would hold them all if that bunch of sassy nigger preachers had made such talk at the courthouse here.\\" Because of his anti-war diatribes, Beard was convicted of sedition in November 1917, and the Scimitar was shut down for good.

A sketchy biography of Arnold is included in an archived version of the website thehistoryofallthings.com. Arnold's work is endorsed in a similar work published in 1908 by Archie Johnson Inger. Likewise, Arnold's text commends the work of Rev. Charles C. Hammond, who published a collection of spiritualist articles Light from the Spirit World in Rochester, New York in 1852. (An apparent companion volume published at the same time is Light From the Spirit World: The Pilgrimage of Thomas Paine, and others, to the Seventh Circle in the Spirit World.) Arnold's text states that the New Jerusalem began to alight on planet Earth on July 4, 1776, and predicts that religious freedom would be 'extinguished' in Europe after 1851, but would find refuge in the United States.

The following is a typical statement of the principle: \\"If a necessary feature has a high astonishment factor, it may be necessary to redesign the feature.\\" The term has been in use in relation to computer use since at least the 1970s. Although first formalized in the field of computer technology, the principle can be applied broadly in other fields. For example, in writing, a cross-reference to another part of the work or a hyperlink should be phrased in a way that accurately tells the reader what to expect. In a book about fishing for bass, \\"For recipes on how to cook your catch, see chapter 4,\\" should not lead the reader to a chapter about bass fishing seasons in various locations. A more general statement of the principle is that a component of a system should behave in a way that most users will expect it to behave. The behavior should not astonish or surprise users. Formulation A textbook formulation is: \\"People are part of the system. The design should match the user's experience, expectations, and mental models.\\" The principle aims to leverage the pre-existing knowledge of users to minimize the learning curve, for instance by designing interfaces that borrow heavily from \\"functionally similar or analogous programs with which your users are likely to be familiar\\". User expectations in this respect may be closely related to a particular computing platform or tradition. For example, Unix command line programs are expected to follow certain conventions with respect to switches, and widgets of Microsoft Windows programs are expected to follow certain conventions with respect to keyboard shortcuts. In more abstract settings like an API, the expectation that function or method names intuitively match their behavior is another example. This practice also involves the application of sensible defaults. When two elements of an interface conflict, or are ambiguous, the behavior should be that which will least surprise the user; in particular a programmer should try to think of the behavior that will least surprise someone who uses the program, rather than that behavior that is natural from knowing the inner workings of the program. The choice of \\"least surprising\\" behavior can depend on the expected audience (for example, end users, programmers, or system administrators). Examples A website could have an input field that focuses automatically after the page loads, such as a search field (e.g. Google Custom Search), or the username field of a login form. Sites offering keyboard shortcuts often allow pressing to see the available shortcuts. Examples include Gmail and Jira. In Windows operating systems and some desktop environments for Linux, the function key typically opens the help program for an application. A similar keyboard shortcut in macOS is . Users expect a help window or context menu when they press the usual help shortcut key(s). Software that instead uses this shortcut for another feature is likely to cause astonishment if no help appears. Malware may exploit user familiarity with regular shortcuts. A programming language's standard library usually provides a function similar to the pseudocode \`ParseInteger(string, radix)\`, which creates a machine-readable integer from a string of human-readable digits. The radix conventionally defaults to 10, meaning the string is interpreted as decimal (base 10). This function usually supports other bases, like binary (base 2) and octal (base 8), but only when they are specified explicitly. In a departure from this convention, JavaScript originally defaulted to base 8 for strings beginning with \\"0\\", causing developer confusion and software bugs.

Ursula Decker-Bönniger reviewed: \\"Andreas Karasiak lotet zwischen verhaltener Klage und dramatischen Zornesausbruch die unterschiedlichen Gefühle des Odysseus stimmlich aus\\" (Andreas Karasiak explores vocally the feelings of Ulisse between restrained lament and dramatic eruption of furor. In 2012, he sang again the role of Jonathan in Handel's Saul, in the final concert celebrating 50 years Schiersteiner Kantorei in Eberbach Abbey, with Christian Immler in the title role. He has recorded operas that are rarely performed, such as Handel's Lotario, Domenico Cimarosa's Gli Orazi e i Curiazi, Gluck's L'innocenza giustificata, Haydn's Die Feuersbrunst and Franz Schubert's Singspiele Der vierjährige Posten; Die Zwilingsbrüder.

Dublin Methodist was the first full-service hospital to be built in Central Ohio in the last 25 years, opening in January 2008. As part of the OhioHealth system of hospitals, Dublin Methodist includes services such as 24-hour emergency department, intensive care beds and private rooms, women’s health services (including obstetrics), as well as inpatient and outpatient surgical services in orthopedics, spine and pain management. Design and construction Front of Dublin Methodist Hospital Dublin Methodist was designed with an emphasis on family spaces, natural light and a focus on comfort such as all private rooms with a sleeping couch for guests. The hospital was also intended to be a quiet environment including the use of electronic communication. There is no overhead paging, and special ceiling tiles are used in common areas to absorb sound. Hospital courtyards and rooftops include 13 gardens. It was named one of the “Most Wired” hospitals in America in a survey that assessed the ways hospitals use information technologies for quality, customer service, public health and safety, business processes and workforce issues. The hospital cost $150 million to construct. The contractor on the project was Elford/Gilbane Building Company. The architect during construction was Karlsberger and built by Elford/Gilbane Building Company. Services Dublin Methodist Hospital received the Outstanding Patient Experience Award in 2017. As part of the OhioHealth system, Dublin Methodist has specially monitored eICU intensive care beds monitoring patients 24/7 with video, audio and vital sign monitors linking to intensive care experts at Riverside Methodist Hospital to enhance the safety for critically ill patients. To preserve patients privacy the eICU equipment has no recording capabilities with either the audio or video system and the camera is only turned toward the patient periodically.

Distributed by the Chicago Tribune Syndicate, this Sunday strip had a long run spanning four decades. It was never a daily strip. Ed Leffingwell began in comics as an assistant to his cousin, Harold Gray, the creator of Little Orphan Annie -- which may explain why the artwork and layouts on Little Joe were very similar to Annie's. Little Joe tended toward the highly dramatic, violent and sometimes even grisly. Its stories usually emphasized harsh frontier justice and basic virtues such as honesty, self reliance, and independence with an occasional touch of wry humor.  History  Little Joe began October 1, 1933, but Ed Leffingwell worked on the strip for only three years. When he died suddenly in December, 1936, Bob Leffingwell (also a Gray assistant) stepped in, continuing the strip until its conclusion in 1972. The resemblance to Little Orphan Annie in both style and content diminished in the early 1950s when the format changed from a dramatic adventure strip to a more simply rendered gag strip. It suffered greatly during its last few years routinely involving Joe and a Navajo boy named Dead Pan retelling a tired old joke. Bob Leffingwell continued to ink and letter Little Orphan Annie until Harold Gray's death in 1969 when the feature passed into other hands. Joe ran in an ever dwindling number of papers until it was caught up in a 1972 syndicate purge of formerly popular strips that included Terry and the Pirates and Smilin' Jack. Comics historian Don Markstein described the storyline: :Joe Oak was 13 years old, though he looked younger, especially at first. He was an only child and his father had been murdered, leaving him and Mom to run the Oak Ranch by themselves. They were assisted by a white-moustached man named Utah, who had been a gunslinger in his youth. Utah was their foreman and, when times were rough, only employee. He assumed the paternal role when it came to teaching Joe proper behavior for a man, and the survival skills he'd need to become one. Other than that, the strip was populated by outlaws, corrupt businessmen and politicians, Indians both good and bad, and similar staples of the genre. Later on, an old friend of Utah's, a charming rogue known only as \\"Ze Gen'ral\\", joined the cast... helping the protagonists out of jams and occasionally (when opportunity permitted) cheating them.Little Joe at Don Markstein's Toonopedia, Archived from the original on September 3, 2015. Starting May 16, 1943, Ze Gen'ral became a topper strip above Little Joe. The topper continued until at least the 1960s. Little Joe was reprinted in Dell Comics' Popular Comics, Super Comics and Dell's Four Color Comics series (1942). The character of \\"Utah\\" appears on the box art of the 1930s Little Orphan Anne Shooting Game. A CD-ROM reprinting early Little Joe strips was released in 2002.

Since his debut in the mid-1970s, he has been among the most prominent bassists in Danish jazz and as a sideman he has appeared on more than 400 albums both with Danish and leading American jazz musicians. Biography Jesper Lundgaard was born in 1954 in Hillerød, Denmark. After first playing guitar for a few years, he started to play bass at age 16. In 1976 he began to study music at Århus University and the same year he became part of Århus' jazz scene when he joined Bent Eriksen's trio. There he met Danish jazz musicians such as Thomas Clausen, Alex Riel, Niels Jørgen Steen, Finn Ziegler, Jesper Thilo, Jørgen Emborg and Jan Zum Vohrde as well as many American musicians, including Dexter Gordon, Harry Sweets Edison, Eddie Lockjaw Davis, Joe Newman, Benny Waters, Hal Singer, Thad Jones, Mel Lewis, Pepper Adams, Howard McGhee, Roy Eldridge and Doug and Jimmy Raney. Lundgaard soon established himself as one of the leading jazz bassists on the Danish jazz scene. In 1978 he became a member of the Thad Jones / Mel Lewis Orchestra and went on a 3-month European tour which would become its last before Thad Jones left the band and it changed its name simply to the Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra. After the tour both Thad Jones and Jesper Lundgaard settled in Copenhagen. Lundgaard became bassist-in-residence at the La Fontaine Jazz Club and also played frequently at other venues such as Jazzhus Montmartre and Slukefter, accompanying musicians such as Benny Carter, Teddy Wilson, Jay McShann, Dorothy Donegan, Phineas Newborn, Mose Allison and Stanley Turrentine. In 1979 he also started recording for SteepleChase Records, appearing on around 40 albums from this label. He was also a sideman for musicians such as Benny Carter and Teddy Wilson on albums released on Storyville Records. He has also recorded with Chet Baker and Duke Jordan on some albums released by Japanese labels. Up through the 1980s, Lundgaard was a member of the Radiojazzgruppen, Ernie Wilkins' Almost Big Band and Thad Jones' Danish big band Eclipse, Parallel to this he went on numerous tours with American musicians. These included lengthy tours with Doug and Jimmy Raney to the Netherlands, France and Germany and others with Tommy Flanagan and Ed Thigpen. In the mid-1980s he also became a member of Bob Rockwell's quartet after Rockwell had become the third former The Thad Jones / Mel Lewis Orchestra-member to permanently move to Copenhagen in 1984. From 1989 to 1991 he was a member of the DR Big Band and in 1993 he joined Svend Asmussen's quartet in which he still plays. In 1994 he formed the Repertory Quartet which released six albums before it was dissolved in 2000. He has also taught and conducted master classes at educational institutions in Denmark as well as at conservatories in Rotterdam, Zürich and Helsinki.

The later Baker Street and Waterloo Railway followed a similar alignment for part of its route. Origins Authorised by the Waterloo and Whitehall Railway Act 1865, its route was: > A Railway commencing in the Parish of St Martin's-in-the-Fields in the > County of Middlesex in the Street or Place known as Great Scotland Yard at > or near the Western End thereof, and terminating in the Parish of Lambeth > and County of Surrey in a Piece of Land belonging to the London and South- > western Railway Company, and in the Occupation of Edwin Benjamin Gammon, > near to and opposite the Arches under the Waterloo Station of that Railway > numbered respectively 249 and 250. The period was extended by the Waterloo and Whitehall Railway (Amendment) Act 1867 and Waterloo and Whitehall Railway Act 1868.  Technical information  The pneumatic pressure was to have been in a diameter tube, with the engine at the Waterloo end sucking and then blowing 25 seat carriages acting as pistons. Edmund Wragge was resident engineer. The railway was intended to cross the river in a tunnel formed of four prefabricated sections of tube, each long, laid in a trench dredged across the river. The sections were to be joined by introducing their ends into junction chambers formed in brick piers constructed below the level of the existing riverbed. The piers were also designed to bear the weight of the sections, which were made of three-quarter- inch boiler plate, surrounded by four rings of brick work, firmly held in place by cement and flanged rings riveted onto the metal. Each section (of which at least one was completed) weighed almost 1,000 tons. Prefabrication began at the Samuda Brothers shipyard, at Poplar, five miles downstream. If completed, it would have been the first Tube railway. Decline and abandonment The line was hit by the 1866 financial crisis caused by the Overend, Gurney and Company bank collapse. On 2 September 1870 the Board of Trade used the Abandonment of Railways Act 1850 and the Railway Companies Act 1867 to declare the railway should be abandoned by the company. Further developments A further railway, the Charing Cross and Waterloo Electric Railway, was incorporated by an Act of 1882 but was abandoned by an Act of 16 July 1885. A third company, the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway, secured an Act in 1893.

It was established on 1 April 2010 to replace the British National Space Centre (BNSC) and took over responsibility for government policy and key budgets for space exploration; it represents the United Kingdom in all negotiations on space matters. The Agency \\"[brings] together all UK civil space activities under one single management\\". It is based at the former BNSC headquarters in Swindon, Wiltshire.  History and aims  The establishment of the UK Space Agency was announced by Lord Mandelson, Lord Drayson and astronaut Major Timothy Peake at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre on 23 March 2010. Around £230 million of funding and management functions were merged into the UK Space Agency from other organisations. \\"Improving co-ordination of UK efforts in fields such as Earth science, telecoms and space exploration\\" will form part of its remit, according to Lord Drayson. Prior to the creation of the Agency, the space and satellite industry in the UK was valued at £9 billion and supported 68,000 jobs. The 20-year aim of the Agency is to increase the industry to £40 billion and 100,000 jobs, and to represent 10% of worldwide space products and services (increasing from the current 6%). This plan arises from the \\"Space Innovation and Growth Strategy\\" (Space-IGS) report, published by the Space Innovation and Growth Team in February 2010. Dr David Williams was appointed Acting Chief Executive on 1 April 2010 and he was confirmed as the first CEO on 1 April 2011. At the ESA Council at Ministerial level in November 2012 the UK budget for space was significantly increased. Alice Bunn is the International Director. Although Space-IGS called for the UK to double European Space Agency (ESA) contributions and to initiate and lead at least three missions between now and 2030, this has not been committed to, with Lord Drayson stating that \\"We will require a compelling business case for each proposal or mission\\". = Transfers of authority= The UK Space Agency took over the following responsibilities from other government organisations: * All responsibilities, personnel, and assets of the British National Space Centre * ESA subscriptions from Natural Environment Research Council, Science and Technology Facilities Council and Technology Strategy Board, including project grants and post- launch support * UK elements of the space components of Global Monitoring for Environment and Security, and the Galileo satellite navigation system * The financial interest in the European Union Satellite Centre (agreed in principle) * Space technology and instrumentation funding from the Research Councils UK and Technology Strategy Board = UK Space Gateway = The UK Space Gateway at Harwell, Oxfordshire is a focal point for growth in the UK's space sector. Harwell is home to a growing number of space organisations including start-ups, inward investors, corporate offices, the Satellite Applications Catapult, RAL Space and ESA's ECSAT Facility. As of April 2016, the site is estimated to host over 600 space-related employees working in circa 60 organisations.  The European Centre for Space Applications and Telecommunications (ECSAT)  ESA’s UK facility, ECSAT, has been developing steadily since 2008, following the UK government’s decision to increase its contribution to ESA. Named after the ESA’s first British Director General, Roy Gibson, ECSAT’s building hosts 100+ jobs including teams in telecommunications and integrated applications. Special emphasis is put on the development of new markets for satellite-based services and applications. In addition, new satellite, ground infrastructure and product developments are being initiated through original schemes of public–private partnerships with world-class operators. The building also houses the Earth Observation Climate Office, Science and Exploration teams and Technology and Quality Management teams supporting ESA research and development programmes in the UK, focusing on ‘game-changing’ technologies and capabilities.  The Satellite Applications Catapult  The Satellite Applications Catapult is an independent innovation and technology company, created as part of the Catapult centres programme to foster growth across the economy through the exploitation of space. The Catapult helps organisations make use of and benefit from satellite technologies, and bring together multi-disciplinary teams to generate ideas and solutions in an open innovation environment. It was established in May 2013 by Innovate UK (formerly known as the Technology Strategy Board) as one of a network of centres to accelerate the take-up of emerging technologies and drive economic growth. It is a not-for-profit research organisation which is registered as a private company limited by guarantee and controlled by its Board.  International Space Innovation Centre  A £40m International Space Innovation Centre (ISIC) was created in 2011 at Harwell alongside the research facility for ESA. Some of its tasks were to investigate climate change, and the security of space systems. £24m of the cost of the centre was to be funded by the government, with the remainder from industry. In April 2013, ISIC merged into the newly formed Satellite Applications Catapult.  Independent satellite navigation system  In November 2018, it was announced that the UK Space Agency would abandon ties to the EU's Galileo satellite system following Brexit. Instead, the Agency will manage the United Kingdom's own system of navigation satellites, the United Kingdom Global Navigation Satellite System. In 2020 there was criticism of the project's estimated £5bn cost. In July 2020, the UK government joined India's Bharti Enterprises in a successful bid to purchase the bankrupt OneWeb satellite company. On 25 September 2020 The Daily Telegraph reported that the United Kingdom Global Navigation Satellite System project had been mothballed as too expensive and unnecessary. It will be replaced with a new project that will explore alternative ways to provide satellite navigation services. = Other UK bodies = RAL Space, based at STFC's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, carries out space research and technology development.

Biography He was the son of the legendary Okinawan martial arts master Matayoshi Shinko 又吉眞光 (1888–1947). The Matayoshi Family have long been associated with the martial arts and they can trace their lineage back over many generations. At one time an early ancestor of Matayoshi Shinpo served as strategic martial arts instructor and as an officer of the Ryukyu royal court up until the last days of the shogunate.http://www.nihonkobudokyoukai.org/martialarts/066/ Matayoshi Shinpo learned martial arts from his father from his birth until his mid twenties. He had learned several kata associated with Naha-Te in his early childhood. Despite being a well-respected expert in Okinawan Karate, Matayoshi Shinpo is perhaps best known for his practice of Kobudo. He started a dojo in the 1960s in memory of his father and called it the Kodokan 光道館. From the Kodokan he began to teach a wide variety of traditional weapons associated with Okinawan peasants. Matayoshi Shinpo continued to learn martial arts from a man affectionally know in Okinawa as Go Ken Ki (Wu Xian Gui). Go Ken Ki was from the Chinese mainland and practiced various styles of southern kung fu. It is from Go Ken Ki that Matayoshi Shinpo learned many of the Chinese forms that he later became famous for demonstrating. Many of the weapons used in Matayoshi Kobudo have their origin in China. The Staff, Sai, Tonfa, Nunchaku, Sansetsukon, Suruchin, Hoe, Sword and Shield are all weapons regularly used and practiced in Chinese kung fu. These weapons are particularly prevalent in the Hung Gar tradition. It may be that Hun Gar has had a strong influence on Mataysohi Shinpo and his Kobudo. Other weapons such as the Oar, the Fishing Spear and the Sickles have their origins in Okinawa. Students of Matayoshi Shinpo are now found all over the world and they continue to practice his style of Kobudo known collectively as \\"Matayoshi Kobudo\\". Some of his more respected later students include Gakiya Yoshiaki and Yamashiro Kenichi. It was the ambition of Matayoshi Shinpo that his art of Kobudo should be practiced all over the world and to that end he travelled extensively teaching his art. Today there are approximately 2000 dojos worldwide that practice Matayoshi Kobudo thanks to his legacy.

William H. Jackson photo When President Ulysses S. Grant created Yellowstone National Park with the signing of the Act of Dedication, March 1, 1872, it was the result of three major expeditions into the region, expeditions that brought the wonders of Yellowstone into public view. Prior to 1869, the Yellowstone region—its rivers, waterfalls, lakes, mountains, valleys and geothermal features were essentially part of an unknown and unexplored territory. Even after the creation of the park, the region remained largely unexplored and its resources unprotected for over a decade until the U.S. Army assumed management of the park in 1886. Even after the U.S. Army took control, legal protection of the park's resources was limited. From 1869 until 1890, a number of notable expeditions contributed not only to the creation of the park, but to a broader public, social and scientific understanding of the park, its resources and wonders. This understanding ultimately led Congress and the Federal Government to adopt much stronger laws to protect the park and its resources culminating in the Lacey Act of 1894. Pre-creation Expeditions (1869-1871) David E. Folsom * Cook–Folsom–Peterson Expedition of 1869  The Cook-Folsom-Peterson Expedition of 1869 was the first organized expedition to explore the region that became Yellowstone National Park. The privately financed expedition was carried out by David E. Folsom, Charles W. Cook and William Peterson of Diamond City, Montana, a gold camp in the Confederate Gulch area of the Big Belt Mountains east of Helena, Montana. The journals kept by Cook and Folsom, as well as their personal accounts to friends were of significant inspirational value to spur the organization of the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition which visited Yellowstone in 1870. * Washburn–Langford–Doane Expedition of 1870  The Washburn Expedition of 1870, explored the region of northwestern Wyoming that a couple years later became Yellowstone National Park in 1872. Led by Henry Washburn, Nathaniel P. Langford and under U.S. Army escort led by Lt. Gustavus C. Doane, the expedition followed the general course of the Cook–Folsom–Peterson Expedition made the previous year.  During their explorations, members of the party made detailed maps and observations of the Yellowstone region, exploring numerous lakes, climbing several mountains and observing wildlife. The expedition visited both the Upper and Lower Geyser Basins, and after observing the regularity of eruptions of one geyser, decided to name it Old Faithful, since it would erupt about once every hour.  The first widely publicized accounts of the region resulted from this expedition and occurred when Langford lectured about the expedition in the East during the Winter and Spring of 1871 and published his Wonders of the Yellowstone in Scribners in May 1871 and Lt. Doane circulated his official report throughout the Department of War. * Hayden Geological Survey of 1871  The Hayden Geological Survey of 1871 explored the region of northwestern Wyoming that became Yellowstone National Park in 1872. It was led by geologist Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden. In the spring of 1871, Hayden selected the members of the survey team, 32 in all from among friends and colleagues, seven previous survey participants and a few political patrons. Included in the party was William Henry Jackson, his photographer from his 1870 survey and Thomas Moran, a guest artist arranged by Jay Cooke. The 1871 survey was not Hayden's first, but it was the first federally funded, geological survey to explore and further document features in the region soon to become Yellowstone National Park and played a prominent role in convincing the U.S. Congress to pass the legislation creating the park. In 1894, Nathaniel P. Langford, the first park superintendent and a member of the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition which explored the park in 1870, wrote this about the Hayden expedition: * Heap- Barlow Expedition of 1871 Post-creation Expeditions (1872-1890) President Chester A. Arthur and party at Old Faithful, 1883 * Hayden Geological Surveys of 1872 and 1878  * Belknap Tour of 1876 In 1876, then U.S. Secretary of War William W. Belknap proposed actions to preserve Yellowstone National Park. In July 1876, Belknap visited Fort Ellis, Montana Territory, and proceeded on a two-week journey through Yellowstone retracing the route of the 1870 Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition. He was guided during this trip by Lt. Gustavus C. Doane who was stationed at Fort Ellis and had been the leader of the military escort of the Washburn Party. * 1876 Snake River Expedition  In the fall of 1876, after a tedious summer dealing with the aftermath of the Battle of the Little Big Horn, Lt. Gustavus C. Doane returned to Fort Ellis, restless for more exploration. All summer he had been planning an exploration of the Snake River regions south of Yellowstone. Doane believed this exploration would gain him the same type recognition that had been bestowed on Hayden for Yellowstone and on John Wesley Powell for the Grand Canyon explorations. Although he had permission to make the exploration from his superiors Colonel John Gibbon and General Alfred Terry whom he had courted during the summer campaign, Doane did this over the head of his immediate commander, Major James Brisbin, the post commander at Fort Ellis.  By all accounts, Doane's 1876 Snake River Expedition was ill-advised and an aborted failure. Doane planned to take his troop of soldiers over the Yellowstone plateau in early winter to begin the trip down the Snake River. With an ingeniously disassembled wooden boat on pack mules, Doane and his party traveled up the Yellowstone River from Fort Ellis eventually reaching Yellowstone Lake on October 24, well behind schedule because of deep snows and brutal cold. The boat proved difficult on Yellowstone Lake because of high winds and was partially wrecked and supplies were lost. The party did not get the boat to Heart Lake until November 7. The weather and cold were brutal and Doane's party did not make the next 20 miles down the Snake to Jackson Lake until December 7, 1876. By this time, they were critically short of supplies and began killing their stock for food. The boat proved unworthy in the Snake's whitewater and was eventually completely wrecked and abandoned. On December 15, 1876, Doane and his troop were near starvation and death when they arrived at a trapper's cabin on the Snake River. Eventually, they made Keenan City, Idaho and then Fort Hall, Idaho by January 4, 1877. By this time however, word of their condition had reached Major Brisbin at Fort Ellis and with permission from General Terry, Brisbin recalled Doane and his troops to Fort Ellis against Doane's wishes. They finally arrived there on February 2, 1877. Doane had put his troops in harms way for his own ambition and almost created a tragedy. This was Doane's last foray into the Yellowstone plateau. * Chester A. Arthur Presidential Expedition of 1883  In May 1883, President Chester A. Arthur under stress from the first years of his unexpected presidency, was encouraged to take a good rest by his advisors. One of those advisors, Senator George Vest of Missouri, suggested a trip to the new national park—Yellowstone. By early summer, the unusual trip was being arranged. President Arthur would visit the park for two weeks in August, unaccompanied by any journalists. He was the first sitting U.S. President to visit Yellowstone. Through his notoriety with the Northern Pacific Railroad and early trips to Yellowstone, Frank Jay Haynes, soon to become the official Yellowstone National Park photographer, was selected as the official photographer for the trip.  In 1882, Vest became aware of concession abuses and outright attempts at uncontrolled monopolies being proposed for Yellowstone National Park concessions by the railroads and other businessmen. He introduced and eventually helped pass legislation that required the Secretary of Interior to submit concession and construction contracts to the Senate for oversight thus stifling potential corruption and abuses. Throughout the remainder of his Senate career, Vest was considered the Self-appointed Protector of Yellowstone National Park and his encouragement of the Arthur expedition brought national attention to Yellowstone. * Hague Geologic Surveys of 1883-1889  In 1883 Arnold Hague, a geologist, was appointed Geologist in charge of the Survey of the Yellowstone National Park and vicinity, and began field-work in August of that year with a large party of assistants, including three assistant geologists: W. H. Weed, G. M. Wright, and J. P. Iddings, a physicist: William Hallock, a chemist: F.A. Gooch, a professional photographer: William H. Jackson and a disbursing clerk: C. D. Davis. The completion of the Northern Pacific Railroad later in the summer attracted general attention to the region and added to the interest taken in the natural phenomena for which the park has become famous. Besides the geological features of the region which were the special object of the Survey, the park was to be converted into a national pleasure resort for persons interested in geysers, hot springs, and natural scenery of a remarkable character; it was to be placed under guard as a huge game presence and was subsequently set aside as a forest reserve and a protected reservoir for the headwaters of the two great rivers the Yellowstone-Missouri and the Snake or Shoshone.  In the prosecution and advancement of these diverse phases of development of the Yellowstone National Park Hague took an active and prominent part urging their importance upon the government authorities in Washington and advising as to the proper administration of the laws and regulations whereby the various features of the park could be preserved in the best manner, while its functions as a pleasure resort, game and forest reserve were properly maintained. He was an ardent advocate of the preservation of the striking features of the region in their natural state, for placing hotels and other buildings where they would not mar the attractiveness of the localities to which they were tributary. He was a vigorous opponent of the attempt to introduce a railroad in the national park. In the study of the region, he was especially interested in the geysers and hot springs but maintained a general oversight of the detailed investigations of his assistants into the geological structure of the region, which consists mostly of igneous rocks with several mountain ranges of stratified rocks. Portions of the area were investigated in detail by Hague himself. The region surveyed was more than in extent and the field-work continued for seven seasons, from 1883 to 1889. The following year Weed and Iddings, under the charge of Hague, explored and mapped the geology of the area north of the Yellowstone National Park, known as the Livingston quadrangle. * Schwatka Winter Expedition of 1887  In December 1886, Arctic explorer Frederick Schwatka planned a winter tour through the park. The expedition was sponsored by the New York World newspaper and The Century Magazine. The expedition started at Mammoth on January 5, 1887. On skis and snowshoes, pulling sleds laden with gear Schwatka, Frank Jay Haynes and eleven other guides made their way from Mammoth to Norris in two days. By the time the group got to Norris, the cold and oxygen sparse elevation had gotten to Schwatka and he had to abandon the tour. Haynes and three other guides Haynes knew and could depend on decided to continue on visiting both the lower, upper geyser basins and Yellowstone Falls before trouble struck. In an attempt to get to Yancey's from Canyon, the party got stranded for 72 hours on the slopes of Mount Washburn in a frigid and blinding snowstorm with little or no food or shelter. They almost perished. Once the weather cleared they made their way to Yancey's to recuperate before returning the Mammoth. The 29-day tour of the park on snowshoes covered nearly 200 miles, with temperatures varying to below zero. Despite the problems on Mount Washburn, Haynes returned with 42 photographs of Yellowstone in the middle of winter, the first ever taken during that time of year. F.J. Haynes during 1887 Winter tour Major protective measures enacted In 1872, when Yellowstone National Park was created, there was yet no legal protection for wildlife in the park. In the early years of the park, administrators, poachers, and tourists were essentially free to kill any game or predator they came across. In January 1883, U.S. Secretary of the Interior, Columbus Delano issued regulations prohibiting hunting of most park animals, but the regulations did not apply to Wolves, Coyotes, Bears, Mountain Lions, and other small predators. Shortly after the U.S. Army took over the administration of the park on August 20, 1886, Captain Moses Harris, the first military superintendent banned public hunting of any wildlife and any predator control was to be left to the park's administration. =The Lacey Act of 1894= In March 1894, Edgar Howell, a poacher from Cooke City, Montana was captured by Captain G. L. Scott, U.S. Army, and a patrol of soldiers for killing Bison in the Pelican Valley section of the park. Unfortunately, there were no laws that would allow prosecution of Howell and he could only be temporarily detained and removed from the park. Shortly after his capture, Frank Jay Haynes park photographer, Emerson Hough noted western author and Billy Hofer, a noted backcountry guide encountered Scott and Howell as Howell was being escorted back to Fort Yellowstone. Haines captured the encounter on film and Hough telegraphed a story back to his publisher: Forest and Stream. The story prompted George Bird Grinnell, editor of Forest and Stream to lobby Congress for a law to allow prosecution of crimes in Yellowstone. The result was the Lacey Act of 1894. Congressman John F. Lacey was an enthusiastic defender of Yellowstone National Park and in 1894, in response to the inability of park administrators to punish poachers of the park's wildlife, Lacey sponsored legislation to give the Department of Interior authority arrest and prosecute law violators in the park. Although only known as the Lacey Act in the context of Yellowstone National Park, in May 1894 Congress passed An Act To protect the birds and animals in Yellowstone National Park, and to punish crimes in said park, and for other purposes. which became the cornerstone of future law enforcement policies in the park. The Act resulted in the appointment of John W. Meldrum as the first U.S. Commissioner in Yellowstone, a position he held until 1935.

He currently resides in Los Angeles, CA.  Education and early career  He was born Gregory Lane Barrett in Bristol, Tennessee, on November 23, 1961. He grew up in Bristol, Virginia, and graduated from Bristol's Virginia High School in 1980. He is a 1986 graduate of Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia. Prior to college, he was a factory worker at Burlington Industries in Bristol, TN. For more than twenty years in print journalism he worked as a local, national and foreign correspondent for, among others, The Augusta Chronicle (Georgia), The Charlotte Observer (North Carolina), The Honolulu Advertiser, the Gannett Company's GNS/USA Today bureau in Washington, D.C., and for The Baltimore Sun.  Books  right right His first non-fiction book, The Gospel of Father Joe: Revolutions & Revelations in the Slums of Bangkok (Wiley 2008), is the story of Redemptorist Catholic priest Rev. Joseph H. Maier, a native of Washington in the United States who lives and works in the port-side slums of Bangkok, Thailand. For more than three decades, \\"Father Joe\\" and his nonprofit Human Development Foundation and Mercy Centre helped relieve Bangkok's grinding poverty by constructing and managing more than thirty slum preschools, four orphanages and two AIDS hospices, often without church sanction or legal permits. The Nautilus Book Awards honored The Gospel of Father Joe with a silver medal in 2009 in the category of Conscious Media-Journalism- Investigative Reporting. In June 2012 Barrett's narrative nonfiction book The Gospel of Rutba: War, Peace and the Good Samaritan Story in Iraq was released by Orbis Books, a leading U.S. publisher of religious books and the publishing arm of the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers. The book was edited by Orbis publisher Robert Ellsberg, son of Daniel Ellsberg, the whistle-blower responsible for releasing the Pentagon Papers in 1971. In The Gospel of Rutba Barrett tells the story of three U.S. Christian peacemakers who were injured in a bad car accident in Iraq during the U.S.-led bombing of that country in March 2003. He chronicles how the western desert town of Ar Rutba, a Sunni- majority town under heavy attack from the United States, turned the other cheek and cared for the injured Americans: author-activist Shane Claiborne of Philadelphia's The Simple Way; Christian Peacemaker Teams veteran Cliff Kindy; and Mennonite pastor-activist Rev. Weldon Nisly. Three days earlier, on March 26, 2003, Rutba's only hospital had been bombed by U.S. Army Special Forces.Barrett, Greg (2012). The Gospel of Rutba: War, Peace and the Good Samaritan Story in Iraq. Maryknoll, New York: Orbis. After rescuing, treating and protecting the peacemakers, Rutba locals refused the Americans' effort to pay them. Dr. Farouq Al-Dulaimi, the director of the hospital bombed three days earlier, asked for the Americans to do only one thing: \\"Go and tell the world about Rutba.\\" Seven years later, Barrett, who had reported from the streets of prewar Iraq in January and February 2003 alongside three-time Nobel Peace Prize nominee Kathy Kelly, returned to Iraq with the unarmed peacemakers in an effort to tell the story of Rutba. Archbishop emeritus Rev. Desmond Tutu contributed the book's foreword and The Simple Way's Shane Claiborne, author of The Irresistible Revolution: Living as an Ordinary Radical, wrote its afterword.  Foreign reporting  As a roving national and international correspondent based in the Washington, D.C. bureau for GNS/USA Today, he was dispatched to Thailand in 2000 to report on the social and economic conditions that had precipitated U.N. protocols intended to combat sex trafficking. It was there that he discovered the humanitarian work of the Mercy Centre and Rev. Joe Maier. Barrett has also reported from Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Israel and the Palestinian Territories.  Kamehameha Schools and Bishop Estate investigation  In 1997, Barrett was the Native Hawaiian Affairs reporter for the morning newspaper in Honolulu, Hawaii, when he began investigating the controversial management of Kamehameha Schools, a private co-educational college-preparatory school founded in 1887 by Bernice Pauahi Bishop, a Hawaiian princess, philanthropist and the great-granddaughter of King Kamehameha I. The Hawaiians-only school, formally known as Kamehameha Schools/Bishop Estate or KSBE, was managed by the five trustees of Bishop Estate, Hawaii's largest private landowner. Barrett's reports on the micromanaging of Kamehameha Schools unleashed critics of Bishop Estate, which led to an investigation of the estate by Hawaii's State Attorney General. By 1998, the trustees, each of whom were being paid between $800,000 to $900,000 annually, had voluntarily resigned or been permanently removed by the state. That same year, the faculty organization at Kamehameha Schools entered Barrett for a local-news Pulitzer for reports that helped \\"to break open the secretive affairs of KSBE (Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate) with unprecedented charges by alumni and faculty of mismanagement of the Kamehameha Schools.\\" Barrett's investigation of KSBE is credited in various books for helping to bring about change at Kamehameha Schools and Bishop Estate.Samuel P.

Topics of his freelance articles have ranged from first-person participatory journalism with him fighting PAL national middleweight champion Ahmad Hempstead in Sacramento's Arco Arena to his investigations into Congress' decades-old War on Cancer, U.S. policy in the Middle East, and essays about his methods of investigative research and reporting.  Children's book  right In Hawaii he co-authored a children's book with writer Jane Hopkins, adapted by Lisa Matsumoto and illustrated by Michael Furuya. The book, Wailana the Waterbug (Mutual Publishing, 1999), was inspired by the brief but inspiring life of three-year-old leukemia victim Alana Dung. Proceeds from the book benefit the Alana Dung Research Foundation, a public charity founded by Alana's parents to help support medical research on terminal illnesses and to improve the quality of life for children. In 2000 Wailana the Waterburg won Hawaii's Ka Palapala Po'okela award for excellence in children's books.

It interconnects telephone subscriber lines or virtual circuits of digital systems to establish telephone calls between subscribers. In historical perspective, telecommunication terms have been used with different semantics over time. The term telephone exchange is often used synonymously with central office, a Bell System term. Often, a central office is defined as a building used to house the inside plant equipment of potentially several telephone exchanges, each serving a certain geographical area. Such an area has also been referred to as the exchange or exchange area. In North America, a central office location may also be identified as a wire center, designating a facility from which a telephone obtains dial tone. For business and billing purposes, telephony carriers define rate centers, which in larger cities may be clusters of central offices, to define specified geographical locations for determining distance measurements. In the United States and Canada, the Bell System established in the 1940s a uniform system of identifying central offices with a three-digit central office code, that was used as a prefix to subscriber telephone numbers. All central offices within a larger region, typically aggregated by state, were assigned a common numbering plan area code. With the development of international and transoceanic telephone trunks, especially driven by direct customer dialing, similar efforts of systematic organization of the telephone networks occurred in many countries in the mid-20th century. For corporate or enterprise use, a private telephone exchange is often referred to as a private branch exchange (PBX), when it has connections to the public switched telephone network. A PBX is installed in enterprise facilities, typically near large office spaces or within an organizational campus to serve the organization's telephones and any private leased line circuits. Smaller installations might deploy a PBX or key telephone system in the office of a receptionist.  History  Tivadar Puskás 1922 diagram of 1877 Boston exchange 1903 manual switch for four subscriber lines (top) with four cross-bar talking circuits (horizontal), and one bar to connect the operator (T). The lowest cross-bar connects idle stations to ground to enable the signaling indicators (F). In the era of the electrical telegraph, its principal users were post offices, railway stations, the more important governmental centers (ministries), stock exchanges, very few nationally distributed newspapers, the largest internationally important corporations, and wealthy individuals.Private Telegraphs, The Sydney Morning Herald, credited to The Times, April 19, 1878, p. 6. Despite the fact that telephone devices existed before the invention of the telephone exchange, their success and economical operation would have been impossible on the same schema and structure of the contemporary telegraph, as prior to the invention of the telephone exchange switchboard, early telephones were hardwired to and communicated with only a single other telephone (such as from an individual's home to the person's business). A telephone exchange is a telephone system located at service centers (central offices) responsible for a small geographic area that provided the switching or interconnection of two or more individual subscriber lines for calls made between them, rather than requiring direct lines between subscriber stations. This made it possible for subscribers to call each other at homes, businesses, or public spaces. These made telephony an available and comfortable communication tool for everyday use, and it gave the impetus for the creation of a whole new industrial sector. As with the invention of the telephone itself, the honor of \\"first telephone exchange\\" has several claimants. One of the first to propose a telephone exchange was Hungarian Tivadar Puskás in 1877 while he was working for Thomas Edison. The first experimental telephone exchange was based on the ideas of Puskás, and it was built by the Bell Telephone Company in Boston in 1877.Frank Lewis Dyer: Edison His Life And Inventions. (page: 71) The world's first state-administered telephone exchange opened on November 12, 1877 in Friedrichsberg close to Berlin under the direction of Heinrich von Stephan. George W. Coy designed and built the first commercial US telephone exchange which opened in New Haven, Connecticut in January, 1878. The switchboard was built from \\"carriage bolts, handles from teapot lids and bustle wire\\" and could handle two simultaneous conversations.National Park Service \\"first switchboard\\" page. Charles Glidden is also credited with establishing an exchange in Lowell, MA. with 50 subscribers in 1878. In Europe other early telephone exchanges were based in London and Manchester, both of which opened under Bell patents in 1879. Belgium had its first International Bell exchange (in Antwerp) a year later. In 1887 Puskás introduced the multiplex switchboard. .Francis S. Wagner: Hungarian Contributions to World Civilization - Page 68 Later exchanges consisted of one to several hundred plug boards staffed by switchboard operators. Each operator sat in front of a vertical panel containing banks of ¼-inch tip-ring-sleeve (3-conductor) jacks, each of which was the local termination of a subscriber's telephone line. In front of the jack panel lay a horizontal panel containing two rows of patch cords, each pair connected to a cord circuit. When a calling party lifted the receiver, the local loop current lit a signal lamp near the jack. The operator responded by inserting the rear cord (answering cord) into the subscriber's jack and switched her headset into the circuit to ask, \\"Number, please?\\" For a local call, the operator inserted the front cord of the pair (ringing cord) into the called party's local jack and started the ringing cycle. For a long-distance call, she plugged into a trunk circuit to connect to another operator in another bank of boards or at a remote central office. In 1918, the average time to complete the connection for a long-distance call was 15 minutes. Early manual switchboards required the operator to operate listening keys and ringing keys, but by the late 1910s and 1920s, advances in switchboard technology led to features which allowed the call to be automatically answered immediately as the operator inserted the answering cord, and ringing would automatically begin as soon as the operator inserted the ringing cord into the called party's jack. The operator would be disconnected from the circuit, allowing her to handle another call, while the caller heard an audible ringback signal, so that that operator would not have to periodically report that she was continuing to ring the line. In the ringdown method, the originating operator called another intermediate operator who would call the called subscriber, or passed it on to another intermediate operator. This chain of intermediate operators could complete the call only if intermediate trunk lines were available between all the centers at the same time. In 1943 when military calls had priority, a cross-country US call might take as long as 2 hours to request and schedule in cities that used manual switchboards for toll calls. On March 10, 1891, Almon Brown Strowger, an undertaker in Kansas City, Missouri, patented the stepping switch, a device which led to the automation of telephone circuit switching. While there were many extensions and adaptations of this initial patent, the one best known consists of 10 levels or banks, each having 10 contacts arranged in a semicircle. When used with a rotary telephone dial, each pair of digits caused the shaft of the central contact \\"hand\\" of the stepping switch to first step (ratchet) up one level for each pulse in the first digit and then to swing horizontally in a contact row with one small rotation for each pulse in the next digit. Later stepping switches were arranged in banks, the first stage of which was a linefinder. If one of up to a hundred subscriber lines had the receiver lifted \\"off hook\\", a linefinder connected the subscriber's line to a free first selector, which returned the subscriber a dial tone to show that it was ready to receive dialed digits. The subscriber's dial pulsed at about 10 pulses per second, although the speed depended on the standard of the particular telephone administration. Exchanges based on the Strowger switch were eventually challenged by other exchange types and later by crossbar technology. These exchange designs promised faster switching and would accept pulses faster than the Strowger's typical 10 pps—typically about 20 pps. At a later date many also accepted DTMF \\"touch tones\\" or other tone signaling systems. A transitional technology (from pulse to DTMF) had converters to convert DTMF to pulse, to feed to older Strowger, panel, or crossbar switches. This technology was used as late as mid-2002. Exchange building in Miskolc, Hungary  Technologies  Many terms used in telecommunication technology differ in meaning and usage among the various English speaking regions. For the purpose of this article the following definitions are made: * Manual service is a condition in which a human telephone operator routes calls inside an exchange without the use of a dial. * Dial service is when an exchange routes calls by a switch interpreting dialed digits. * A telephone switch is the switching equipment of an exchange. * A concentrator is a device that concentrates traffic, be it remote or co-located with the switch. * An off- hook condition represents a circuit that is in use, e.g., when a phone call is in progress. * An on-hook condition represents an idle circuit, i.e. no phone call is in progress. * A wire center is the area served by a particular switch or central office. Central office originally referred to switching equipment and its operators, it is also used generally for the building that houses switching and related inside plant equipment. In United States telecommunication jargon, a central office (C.O.) is a common carrier switching center Class 5 telephone switch in which trunks and local loops are terminated and switched.Source: from Federal Standard 1037C. In the UK, a telephone exchange means an exchange building, and is also the name for a telephone switch. =Manual service exchanges= 1924 PBX switchboard With manual service, the customer lifts the receiver off-hook and asks the operator to connect the call to a requested number. Provided that the number is in the same central office, and located on the operator's switchboard, the operator connects the call by plugging the ringing cord into the jack corresponding to the called customer's line. If the called party's line is on a different switchboard in the same office, or in a different central office, the operator plugs into the trunk for the destination switchboard or office and asks the operator answering (known as the \\"B\\" operator) to connect the call. Most urban exchanges provided common-battery service, meaning that the central office provided power to the subscriber telephone circuits for operation of the transmitter, as well as for automatic signaling with rotary dials. In common- battery systems, the pair of wires from a subscriber's telephone to the exchange carry 48V (nominal) DC potential from the telephone company end across the conductors. The telephone presents an open circuit when it is on- hook or idle.Connected to a switch, an off-hook condition operates a relay to connect the line to a dial tone generator and a device to collect dialed digits. When a subscriber's phone is off-hook, it presents an electrical resistance across the line which causes current to flow through the telephone and wires to the central office. In a manually operated switchboard, this current flowed through a relay coil, and actuated a buzzer or a lamp on the operator's switchboard, signaling the operator to perform service. In the largest cities, it took many years to convert every office to automatic equipment, such as a panel switch. During this transition period, once numbers were standardized to the 2L-4N or 2L-5N format (two-letter exchange name and either four or five digits), it was possible to dial a number located in a manual exchange and be connected without requesting operator assistance. The policy of the Bell System stated that customers in large cities should not need to be concerned with the type of office, whether they were calling a manual or an automatic office. When a subscriber dialed the number of a manual station, an operator at the destination office answered the call after seeing the number on an indicator, and connected the call by plugging a cord into the outgoing circuit and ringing the destination station. For example, if a dial customer calling from TAylor 4725 dialed a number served by a manual exchange, e.g., ADams 1383-W, the call was completed, from the subscriber's perspective, exactly as a call to LEnnox 5813, in an automated exchange. The party line letters W, R, J, and M were only used in manual exchanges with jack-per-line party lines. Montreal telephone exchange () In contrast to the listing format MAin 1234 for an automated office with two capital letters, a manual office, having listings such as Hillside 834 or East 23, was recognizable by the format in which the second letter was not capitalized. Rural areas, as well as the smallest towns, had manual service and signaling was accomplished with magneto telephones, which had a crank for the signaling generator. To alert the operator, or another subscriber on the same line, the subscriber turned the crank to generate ringing current. The switchboard responded by interrupting the circuit, which dropped a metal tab above the subscriber's line jack and sounded a buzzer. Dry cell batteries, normally two large N°. 6 cells in the subscriber's telephone, provided the direct current for the transmitter. Such magneto systems were in use in the US as late as 1983, as in the small town, Bryant Pond, Woodstock, Maine. Many small town magneto systems featured party lines, anywhere from two to ten or more subscribers sharing a single line. When calling a party, the operator used code ringing, a distinctive ringing signal sequence, such as two long rings followed by one short ring. Everyone on the line could hear the signals, and could pick up and monitor other people's conversations. =Early automatic exchanges= A rural telephone exchange building in Australia Automatic exchanges, or dial service, came into existence in the early 20th century. Their purpose was to eliminate the need for human switchboard operators who completed the connections required for a telephone call. Automation replaced human operators with electromechanical systems and telephones were equipped with a dial by which a caller transmitted the destination telephone number to the automatic switching system. A telephone exchange automatically senses an off-hook condition of the telephone when the user removes the handset from the switchhook or cradle. The exchange provides dial tone at that time to indicate to the user that the exchange is ready to receive dialed digits. The pulses or DTMF tones generated by the telephone are processed and a connection is established to the destination telephone within the same exchange or to another distant exchange. The exchange maintains the connection until one of the parties hangs up. This monitoring of connection status is called supervision. Additional features, such as billing equipment, may also be incorporated into the exchange. The Bell System dial service implemented a feature called automatic number identification (ANI) which facilitated services like automated billing, toll- free 800-numbers, and 9-1-1 service. In manual service, the operator knows where a call is originating by the light on the switchboard jack field. Before ANI, long-distance calls were placed into an operator queue and the operator asked the calling party's number and recorded it on a paper toll ticket. Early exchanges were electromechanical systems using motors, shaft drives, rotating switches and relays. Some types of automatic exchanges were the Strowger switch or step-by-step switch, All Relay, X-Y, panel switch, Rotary system and the crossbar switch. Electromechanical signaling Circuits interconnecting switches are called trunks. Before Signalling System 7, Bell System electromechanical switches in the United States originally communicated with one another over trunks using a variety of DC voltages and signaling tones, replaced today by digital signals. Some signaling communicated dialed digits. An early form called Panel Call Indicator Pulsing used quaternary pulses to set up calls between a panel switch and a manual switchboard. Probably the most common form of communicating dialed digits between electromechanical switches was sending dial pulses, equivalent to a rotary dial's pulsing, but sent over trunk circuits between switches. In Bell System trunks, it was common to use 20 pulse-per-second between crossbar switches and crossbar tandems. This was twice the rate of Western Electric/Bell System telephone dials. Using the faster pulsing rate made trunk utilization more efficient because the switch spent half as long listening to digits. DTMF was not used for trunk signaling. Multi-frequency (MF) was the last of the pre- digital methods. It used a different set of tones sent in pairs like DTMF. Dialing was preceded by a special keypulse (KP) signal and followed by a start (ST). Variations of the Bell System MF tone scheme became a CCITT standard. Similar schemes were used in the Americas and in some European countries including Spain. Digit strings between switches were often abbreviated to further improve utilization. For example, one switch might send only the last four or five digits of a telephone number. In one case, seven digit numbers were preceded by a digit 1 or 2 to differentiate between two area codes or office codes, (a two-digit-per-call savings). This improved revenue per trunk and reduced the number of digit receivers needed in a switch. Every task in electromechanical switches was done in big metallic pieces of hardware. Every fractional second cut off of call set up time meant fewer racks of equipment to handle call traffic. Examples of signals communicating supervision or call progress include E and M signaling, SF signaling, and robbed-bit signaling. In physical (not carrier) E and M trunk circuits, trunks were four wire. Fifty trunks would require a hundred pair cable between switches, for example. Conductors in one common circuit configuration were named tip, ring, ear (E) and mouth (M). Tip and ring were the voice-carrying pair, and named after the tip and ring on the three conductor cords on the manual operator's console. In two-way trunks with E and M signaling, a handshake took place to prevent both switches from colliding by dialing calls on the same trunk at the same time. By changing the state of these leads from ground to -48 volts, the switches stepped through a handshake protocol. Using DC voltage changes, the local switch would send a signal to get ready for a call and the remote switch would reply with an acknowledgment (a wink) to go ahead with dial pulsing. This was done with relay logic and discrete electronics. These voltage changes on the trunk circuit would cause pops or clicks that were audible to the subscriber as the electrical handshaking stepped through its protocol. Another handshake, to start timing for billing purposes, caused a second set of clunks when the called party answered. A second common form of signaling for supervision was called single-frequency or SF signaling. The most common form of this used a steady 2,600 Hz tone to identify a trunk as idle. Trunk circuitry hearing a 2,600 Hz tone for a certain duration would go idle. (The duration requirement reduced falsing.) Some systems used tone frequencies over 3,000 Hz, particularly on SSB frequency division multiplex microwave radio relays. On T-carrier digital transmission systems, bits within the T-1 data stream were used to transmit supervision. By careful design, the appropriated bits did not change voice quality appreciably. Robbed bits were translated to changes in contact states (opens and closures) by electronics in the channel bank hardware. This allowed direct current E and M signaling, or dial pulses, to be sent between electromechanical switches over a digital carrier which did not have DC continuity. Sounds A characteristic of electromechanical switching equipment is that the maintenance staff could hear the mechanical clattering of Strowgers, panel switches or crossbar relays. Most Bell System central offices were housed in reinforced concrete buildings with concrete ceilings and floors. In rural areas some smaller switching facilities, such as community dial offices (CDOs), were housed in prefabricated metal buildings. These facilities almost always had concrete floors. The hard surfaces reflected sounds. During heavy use periods, it could be difficult to converse in a central office switch room due to the clatter of calls being processed in a large switch. For example, on Mother's Day in the US, or on a Friday evening around 5pm, the metallic rattling could make raised voices necessary. For wire spring relay markers these noises resembled hail falling on a metallic roof. On a pre-dawn Sunday morning, call processing might slow to the extent that one might be able to hear individual calls being dialed and set up. There were also noises from whining power inverters and whirring ringing generators. Some systems had a continual, rhythmic \\"clack-clack-clack\\" from wire spring relays that made reorder (120 ipm) and busy (60 ipm) signals. Bell System installations typically had alarm bells, gongs, or chimes to announce alarms calling attention to a failed switch element. A trouble reporting card system was connected to switch common control elements. These trouble reporting systems punctured cardboard cards with a code that logged the nature of a failure. Reed relay technology in stored program control exchange finally quieted the environment. Maintenance tasks Manual test board in an electromechanical switching office staffed by a technician Electromechanical switching systems required sources of electricity in form of direct current (DC), as well as alternating ring current (AC), which were generated on-site with mechanical generators. In addition, telephone switches required adjustment of many mechanical parts. Unlike modern switches, a circuit connecting a dialed call through an electromechanical switch had DC continuity within the local exchange area via metallic conductors. The design and maintenance procedures of all systems involved methods to avoid that subscribers experienced undue changes in the quality of the service or that they noticed failures. A variety of tools referred to as make-busys were plugged into electromechanical switch elements upon failure and during repairs. A make-busy identified the part being worked on as in-use, causing the switching logic to route around it. A similar tool was called a TD tool. Delinquent subscribers had their service temporarily denied (TDed). This was effected by plugging a tool into the subscriber's office equipment on Crossbar systems or line group in step-by-step switches. The subscriber could receive calls but could not dial out. Strowger-based, step-by-step offices in the Bell System required continuous maintenance, such as cleaning. Indicator lights on equipment bays alerted staff to conditions such as blown fuses (usually white lamps) or a permanent signal (stuck off-hook condition, usually green indicators). Step offices were more susceptible to single-point failures than newer technologies. Crossbar offices used more shared, common control circuits. For example, a digit receiver (part of an element called an Originating Register) would be connected to a call just long enough to collect the subscriber's dialed digits. Crossbar architecture was more flexible than step offices. Later crossbar systems had punch-card-based trouble reporting systems. By the 1970s, automatic number identification had been retrofitted to nearly all step-by-step and crossbar switches in the Bell System. Electronic switches Electronic switching systems gradually evolved in stages from electromechanical hybrids with stored program control to the fully digital systems. Early systems used reed relay-switched metallic paths under digital control. Equipment testing, phone numbers reassignments, circuit lockouts and similar tasks were accomplished by data entry on a terminal. Examples of these systems included the Western Electric 1ESS switch, Northern Telecom SP1, Ericsson AXE, Automatic Electric EAX-1 & EAX-2, Philips PRX/A, ITT Metaconta, British GPO/BT TXE series and several other designs were similar. Ericsson also developed a fully computerized version of their ARF crossbar exchange called ARE. These used a crossbar switching matrix with a fully computerized control system and provided a wide range of advanced services. Local versions were called ARE11 while tandem versions were known as ARE13. They were used in Scandinavia, Australia, Ireland and many other countries in the late 1970s and into the 1980s when they were replaced with digital technology. These systems could use the old electromechanical signaling methods inherited from crossbar and step-by-step switches. They also introduced a new form of data communications: two 1ESS exchanges could communicate with one another using a data link called Common Channel Interoffice Signaling, (CCIS). This data link was based on CCITT 6, a predecessor to SS7. In European systems R2 signalling was normally used. =Digital switches= A typical satellite PABX with front cover removed Digital switches work by connecting two or more digital circuits, according to a dialed telephone number or other instruction. Calls are set up between switches. In modern networks, this is usually controlled using the Signalling System 7 (SS7) protocol, or one of its variants. Many networks around the world are now transitioning to voice over IP technologies which use Internet- based protocols such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). These may have superseded TDM and SS7 based technologies in some networks. The concepts of digital switching were developed by various labs in the United States and in Europe from the 1930s onwards. The first prototype digital switch was developed by Bell Labs as part of the ESSEX project while the first true digital exchange to be combined with digital transmission systems was designed by LCT (Laboratoire Central de Telecommunications) in Paris. The first digital switch to be placed into a public network was the Empress Exchange in London, England which was designed by the General Post Office research labs. This was a tandem switch that connected three Strowger exchanges in the London area. The first commercial roll-out of a fully digital local switching system was Alcatel's E10 system which began serving customers in Brittany in Northwestern France in 1972. Prominent examples of digital switches include: *Ericsson's AXE telephone exchange is the most widely used digital switching platform in the world and can be found throughout Europe and in most countries around the world. It is also very popular in mobile applications. This highly modular system was developed in Sweden in the 1970s as a replacement for the very popular range of Ericsson crossbar switches ARF, ARM, ARK and ARE used by many European networks from the 1950s onwards. *Alcatel-Lucent inherited three of the world's most iconic digital switching systems : Alcatel E10, 1000-S12, and the Western Electric 5ESS. :Alcatel developed the E10 system in France during the late 1960s and 1970s. This widely used family of digital switches was one of the earliest TDM switches to be widely used in public networks. Subscribers were first connected to E10A switches in France in 1972. This system is used in France, Ireland, China, and many other countries. It has been through many revisions and current versions are even integrated into All IP networks. :Alcatel also acquired ITT System 12 which when it bought ITT's European operations. The S12 system and E10 systems were merged into a single platform in the 1990s. The S12 system is used in Germany, Italy, Australia, Belgium, China, India, and many other countries around the world. :Finally, when Alcatel and Lucent merged, the company acquired Lucent's 5ESS and 4ESS systems used throughout the United States of America and in many other countries. *Nokia Siemens Networks EWSD originally developed by Siemens, Bosch and for the German market is used throughout the world. *Nortel now Genband DMS100 is very popular with operators all over the world. * GTD-5 EAX developed by GTE Automatic Electric *NEC NEAX used in Japan, New Zealand and many other countries. *Marconi System X originally developed by GPT and Plessey is a type of digital exchange used by BT Group in the UK public telephone network. A digital exchange (Nortel DMS-100) used by an operator to offer local and long- distance services in France. Each switch typically serves 10,000–100,000+ subscribers depending on the geographic area Digital switches encode the speech going on, in 8,000 time slices per second. At each time slice, a digital PCM representation of the tone is made. The digits are then sent to the receiving end of the line, where the reverse process occurs, to produce the sound for the receiving phone. In other words, when someone uses a telephone, the speaker's voice is \\"encoded\\" then reconstructed for the person on the other end. The speaker's voice is delayed in the process by a small fraction of one second — it is not \\"live\\", it is reconstructed — delayed only minutely. Individual local loop telephone lines are connected to a remote concentrator. In many cases, the concentrator is co-located in the same building as the switch. The interface between remote concentrators and telephone switches has been standardised by ETSI as the V5 protocol. Concentrators are used because most telephones are idle most of the day, hence the traffic from hundreds or thousands of them may be concentrated into only tens or hundreds of shared connections. Some telephone switches do not have concentrators directly connected to them, but rather are used to connect calls between other telephone switches. These complex machines (or a series of them) in a central exchange building are referred to as \\"carrier-level\\" switches or tandem switches. Some telephone exchange buildings in small towns now house only remote or satellite switches, and are homed upon a \\"parent\\" switch, usually several kilometres away. The remote switch is dependent on the parent switch for routing and number plan information. Unlike a digital loop carrier, a remote switch can route calls between local phones itself, without using trunks to the parent switch. Telephone switches are usually owned and operated by a telephone service provider or carrier and located in their premises, but sometimes individual businesses or private commercial buildings will house their own switch, called a PBX, or Private branch exchange. Map of the Wire Center locations in the US Map of the Central Office locations in the US =The switch's place in the system= Telephone switches are a small component of a large network. A major part, in terms of expense, maintenance, and logistics of the telephone system is outside plant, which is the wiring outside the central office. While many subscribers were served with party- lines in the middle of the 20th century, it was the goal that each subscriber telephone station were connected to an individual pair of wires from the switching system. A typical central office may have tens of thousands of pairs of wires that appear on terminal blocks called the main distribution frame (MDF). A component of the MDF is protection: fuses or other devices that protect the switch from lightning, shorts with electric power lines, or other foreign voltages. In a typical telephone company, a large database tracks information about each subscriber pair and the status of each jumper. Before computerization of Bell System records in the 1980s, this information was handwritten in pencil in accounting ledger books. To reduce the expense of outside plant, some companies use \\"pair gain\\" devices to provide telephone service to subscribers. These devices are used to provide service where existing copper facilities have been exhausted or by siting in a neighborhood, can reduce the length of copper pairs, enabling digital services such as Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) or digital subscriber line (DSL). Pair gain or digital loop carriers (DLCs) are located outside the central office, usually in a large neighborhood distant from the CO. DLCs are often referred to as Subscriber Loop Carriers (SLCs), after a Lucent proprietary product. DLCs can be configured as universal (UDLCs) or integrated (IDLCs). Universal DLCs have two terminals, a central office terminal (COT) and a remote terminal (RT), that function similarly. Both terminals interface with analog signals, convert to digital signals, and transport to the other side where the reverse is performed. Sometimes, the transport is handled by separate equipment. In an Integrated DLC, the COT is eliminated. Instead, the RT is connected digitally to equipment in the telephone switch. This reduces the total amount of equipment required. Switches are used in both local central offices and in long distance centers. There are two major types in the Public switched telephone network (PSTN), the Class 4 telephone switches designed for toll or switch-to-switch connections, and the Class 5 telephone switches or subscriber switches, which manage connections from subscriber telephones. Since the 1990s, hybrid Class 4/5 switching systems that serve both functions have become common. Another element of the telephone network is time and timing. Switching, transmission and billing equipment may be slaved to very high accuracy 10 MHz standards which synchronize time events to very close intervals. Time-standards equipment may include Rubidium- or Caesium- based standards and a Global Positioning System receiver. Switch design Long-distance switches may use a slower, more efficient switch-allocation algorithm than local central offices, because they have near 100% utilization of their input and output channels. Central offices have more than 90% of their channel capacity unused. Traditional telephone switches connected physical circuits (e.g., wire pairs) while modern telephone switches use a combination of space- and time-division switching. In other words, each voice channel is represented by a time slot (say 1 or 2) on a physical wire pair (A or B). In order to connect two voice channels (say A1 and B2) together, the telephone switch interchanges the information between A1 and B2. It switches both the time slot and physical connection. To do this, it exchanges data between the time slots and connections 8,000 times per second, under control of digital logic that cycles through electronic lists of the current connections. Using both types of switching makes a modern switch far smaller than either a space or time switch could be by itself. The structure of a switch is an odd number of layers of smaller, simpler subswitches. Each layer is interconnected by a web of wires that goes from each subswitch, to a set of the next layer of subswitches. In some designs, a physical (space) switching layer alternates with a time switching layer. The layers are symmetric, because in a telephone system callers can also be called. Other designs use time-switching only, throughout the switch. A time-division subswitch reads a complete cycle of time slots into a memory, and then writes it out in a different order, also under control of a cyclic computer memory. This causes some delay in the signal. A space-division subswitch switches electrical paths, often using some variant of a nonblocking minimal spanning switch, or a crossover switch. Switch control algorithms =Fully connected mesh network= One way is to have enough switching fabric to assure that the pairwise allocation will always succeed by building a fully connected mesh network. This is the method usually used in central office switches, which have low utilization of their resources. = Clos's nonblocking switch algorithm = The connections between layers of subswitches of telephone switching system are scarce resources, allocated by special control logic in a fault tolerant manner. Clos networks are often used. Fault tolerance Composite switches are inherently fault-tolerant. If a subswitch fails, the controlling computer can sense it during a periodic test. The computer marks all the connections to the subswitch as \\"in use\\". This prevents new calls, and does not interrupt old calls that remain working. As calls in progress end, the subswitch becomes unused, and new calls avoid the subswitch because it's already \\"in use.\\" Some time later, a technician can replace the circuit board. When the next test succeeds, the connections to the repaired subsystem are marked \\"not in use\\", and the switch returns to full operation. To prevent frustration with unsensed failures, all the connections between layers in the switch are allocated using first-in-first-out lists (queues). As a result, if a connection is faulty or noisy and the customer hangs up and redials, they will get a different set of connections and subswitches. A last-in-first-out (stack) allocation of connections might cause a continuing string of very frustrating failures. Fire and disaster recovery Second Avenue exchange, NYC, site of the 1975 New York Telephone Exchange fire. The central exchange, due to the system's design, is almost always a single point of failure for local calls. As the capacity of individual switches and the optical fibre which interconnects them increases, potential disruption caused by destruction of one local office will only be magnified. Multiple fibre connections can be used to provide redundancy to voice and data connections between switching centres, but careful network design is required to avoid situations where a main fibre and its backup both go through the same damaged central office as a potential common mode failure.

Through a partnership with the Pennsylvania SPCA and the Piazza Auto Group, Stigall has helped find homes for over 100 shelter animals through his weekly on-air segment “The Piazza Pet of the Week.” Philadelphia’s USO chapter known as Liberty USO has partnered with Stigall and the Philadelphia Phillies to surprise military service members annually with a trip to Phillies Fantasy Camp in Clearwater, Florida. Controversy In March 2011, Stigall became heavily involved in the Delaware County priest trial.

Brashs was founded in 1862 by Marcus Brasch. The C in the name was dropped during the first world war due to anti-Germanic feeling. The first store in Elizabeth Street, Melbourne specialised in pianos and reed organs and remained the company's flag-ship store until the group's demise. For the latter half of the 19th century and all through the 20th, Brashs remained a leading Music House although Victorian wide expansion didn't begin until the mid 1950s and interstate 30 years later, through a combination of acquisitions and new store openings. This resulted in over 100 stores in all states and territories. History Brashs first opened in 1862 at 108 Elizabeth Street, Melbourne by Marcus Brasch. Originally it retailed pianos and other musical instruments, with the slogan, \\"a home is not a home without a piano\\".A Brash look at the way to do business Australian Financial Review 9 June 1990 Later it would expand their product line to include sheet music. The business was later taken over by Marcus' son, Alfred Brash. Alfred traded the business through the Great Depression, with an astute idea allowing his customers to repay the debts owed on the pianos over a longer period (20 years rather than 5), as it realised that the pianos would be kept in a better condition in the customers' homes than repossessed in his warehouse. Post World War II, Brash boomed, as it sold refrigerators and took trade-ins on old ice chests. The traded in ice- chests were then on-sold in sales in South Melbourne, then a poor community. Geoff Brash later took over from his father. By the 1970s, Brashs expanded further, adding vinyl records, pre-recorded and blank cassettes to their line. in the mid 1980s, it stopped selling whitegoods. In an effort to streamline operations, Brashs was split into Brashs, a company that sold audio systems, microwaves and compact discs, and Allans, which focused on musical instruments. Geoff Brash stepped down as executive Chairman in 1988 but stayed on as a director. By the 1990s, its product base expanded to selling Hi Fi stereos, video cassette recorders, microwaves and televisions. It also resumed selling white goods. Operations Brashs main flagship store at 244 Pitt Street, Sydney. It was opened in December 1986, then shutdown in April 1998 when Brashs went into administration. From 1999 to 2009 the building was leased out to several bargain stores. This photo taken March 2010 shows the building empty, ready for demolition. On 6 December 1986, Brashs opened Australia's first major megastore at 244 Pitt Street, Sydney. This address now forms part of the plaza of the ANZ Bank Centre. Brashs struggled from the early 1990s onwards. Its re-entry into the whitegoods market was unsuccessful, and sustained heavy losses. According to Geoff Brash, the last family executive, the problems that caused the collapse were authoritarian leadership, cheapening of values, advertising that didn't deliver, over- expansion, faulty management information systems, increased competition and internal conflict. Brashs was a company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. In 1995 the Brashs retail chain was placed into voluntary administration. It was delisted and shareholders did not receive any return. Subsequently, it was purchased by the Singapore based businessman Ong Beng Seng at a cost of $40 million.Ducking For Cover Sydney Morning Herald 10 August 2003 During February 1998, the chain fell into receivership with debts owing of $80 million, which was managed by accountancy firm KPMG. At that time the Brashs chain had 105 outlets, employing over 2,000 staff members. Marketing Brashs mainly used television advertising and print for promoting their sales and products.

The text has been set to music by Frank Bridge, Charles Ives, Ottorino Resphigi, Roy Ewing Agnew, and Benjamin Britten. Structure The rhyme scheme of the eight lines is abab cccb. The triplet of vain/strain/main in the second half of the poem adds to the sense of the piling up of emotions. It also has the effect of slowing down the poem. Summary The dominant themes of the poem are isolation, loneliness, and death. It is a scene of desolation and despair. The wind moans in a grief that cannot be expressed in words; the rain storm billows in vain; the trees are barren and their branches strain under the unceasing onslaught. A gloom pervades the world. A dirge is a song meant to invoke and express the emotions of grief and mourning that are typical of a funeral. Images of nature are used to symbolize the grief he feels, such as the moaning and wild wind, the sullen clouds, the sad storm, the bare woods, the deep caves, and the dreary main. He imbues his natural surroundings with anthropomorphic characteristics and qualities to express his grief. The nouns are modified by adjectives that give them human attributes and traits to express his own emotions of dreariness and sadness. He concludes that the whole world is “wrong” and is grieving. Shelley wrote the poem after the deaths of his friend John Keats and his son William who were buried in a cemetery in Rome. The untimely death of Keats reopened the floodgates of emotion for Shelley, inevitably leading him to reexperience the sadness and pain he felt for the death of his infant son. In the second line, “Grief too sad for song,” Shelley argued that the grief was ineffable, inexpressible in words. There is no solace. The entire world is “wrong.” The last line, “Wail, for the world’s wrong!”, provides a sense of hope and consolation.  Poem  Rough wind, that moanest loud Grief too sad for song; Wild wind, when sullen cloud Knells all the night long; Sad storm whose tears are vain, Bare woods, whose branches strain, Deep caves and dreary main,— Wail, for the world's wrong!

The Council expressed concern about the continued fighting around the city of Goražde and its impact throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina and the negotiations. The city was a United Nations Protected Area and the Bosnian Serb Army was strongly condemned for its offensive against it and the civilian population, in addition to attacks on humanitarian relief workers which were in violation of international humanitarian law. The Bosnian Serbs were condemned further for their failure to uphold commitments and negotiate in good faith. Obstacles to the freedom of movement and attacks on the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) were condemned, with the Council determined that it make full use of its mandate in resolutions 824 (1993), 836 (1993), 844 (1993) and 908 (1994) to contribute towards a durable ceasefire in the region. Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, an immediate ceasefire was demanded between the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serbs, while attacks against Goražde were condemned. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros- Ghali was invited to ensure that UNPROFOR is able to monitor the situation, including measures to put heavy weapons under United Nations control. This allowed for the use of air strikes if there was no compliance with this provision. The resolution called for an end to provocations in the safe areas and demanded the release of United Nations personnel detained by Bosnian Serb forces. The freedom of movement of UNPROFOR was demanded while a review of the number of required troops would take place by 30 April 1994. The Council underlined the need for a political settlement with close co-operation with the representatives of the United States, Russia, United Nations and European Union.

Keith Bissell. Keith Warren Bissell (12 February 1912 in Meaford, Ontario – 9 May 1992 in Newmarket, Ontario) was a Canadian composer, conductor, and music educator. He was particularly known for his choral music, which often implemented elements of Canadian folk music. A passionate educator, he was a pupil of Carl Orff and was influential in popularizing the Orff Schulwerk methodology within North America. From 1957 to 1958 he was President of the Ontario Music Educators' Association. He was conductor and Artistic Director of the National Youth Orchestra of Canada in 1970–1971. He also was vice-president of the Canadian Music Council for several years and president of the Canadian Music Centre from 1975-1977.Keith Bissell at Encyclopedia of Music in Canada, by Margaret Drynan, accessed August 30, 2019 Bissell began his career as a public school teacher in Toronto from 1934-1948. During this time he began his professional music studies at the University of Toronto where he earned a Bachelor of Music in 1942. He was particularly influenced by his professor in music composition, Leo Smith. In 1948 Bissell was appointed the assistant supervisor of the music program for the Edmonton school district. After just one year he was made supervisor of the program, serving in that capacity for seven years. In 1952 he founded the Edmonton Junior Symphony Orchestra. He also worked as the organist/choirmaster for Christ Church in Edmonton. Bissell left Edmonton in 1955 to become supervisor of the music program for the Scarborough school district, a position he held into the 1970s. In 1956 he founded the Scarborough Teachers' Chorus, which he conducted up through 1970. In 1960 he went on a sabbatical to study music education methods with Gunild Keetman and Carl Orff in Munich. After these studies he implemented the Orff Schulwerk methodology within the Scarborough school system, using his own compositions and Canadian folk music to help translate the German methodology into an English language context. His success in this area led to his invitation to lecture on the Orff Schulwerk method at many universities and music conservatories throughout North America. From 1960 to 1973, he led the Scarborough Orff Ensemble. Bissell was a lifelong exponent of Canadian music. In 1963 he and John Adaskin organized the first Canadian composers symposium in music education in Toronto. In 1976 a trust fund was established in his name that annually commissions a choral work to be written for school use by a Canadian composer. He was an associate of the Canadian Music Center and was awarded the Canadian Music Council Medal in 1978.

It has generally been assumed that Aristotle was a member of the Cyrenaic school, but this assumption is somewhat doubtful. According to Diogenes Laërtius, he wrote a work on the art of poetry.

The company develops and manufactures equipment used in optical fiber fusion splicing, including products for stripping and preparation, testing and analysing and fiber end-face inspection, but is most well known for its automated optical fiber recoating and fiber cleaving systems. Nyfors products are sold internationally to customers within a wide range of industrial sectors and to public and private research institutions. The company has its origin in the telecommunications industry and was founded in 1987 by Uwe Böttcher, the former head of Fusion Splicing Development and Production at LM Ericsson Fiber Optics in Stockholm. Nyfors first commercial product was an optical fiber recoater launched in 1988. Recoating Optical fiber recoating is the process of restoring the primary coating to stripped optical fiber sections after fusion splicing. The polymer comprising the recoat is usually similar in composition to the original fiber polymer coating. Nyfors optical fiber recoaters are designed to restore the primary coating on spliced optical fibers with acrylate coatings. Due to the mould design, the restored part of the coating has a diameter and other properties, such as eccentricity and roundness, that are almost identical to the original fiber. One of the first major projects in which Nyfors participated was the submarine optical fiber cable between the Swedish mainland and Gotland in the Baltic Sea. The project was carried out in close collaboration between Alcatel and the public telephone company Televerket, with Nyfors providing the on-board optical fiber recoaters. Partly as a result of the technological development carried out during this project, the company was able to launch its first commercial optical fiber recoater in 1988.

The Council noted that an agreement signed in Sirte, Libya, between the two countries provided for a presence of the United Nations to monitor the withdrawal by Libya, while announcing its intention to promote peaceful relations between both parties. It was decided that UNASOG would be established for a single period of up to forty days, beginning from the adoption of the present resolution. It would consist of nine United Nations observers and six support staff to observe the implementation of the agreement. Co-operation from both parties with the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was urged, and in particular to grant it freedom of movement. The Council also recognised that UNASOG would need to travel to Libya by air and this would require an exemption from international sanctions placed on the country and in particular provisions of Resolution 748 (1992). Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council decided that the provisions would not apply to the UNASOG mission, requesting the Secretary- General to inform the Committee established in Resolution 748 of flights made, and to keep the Council updated on developments.

England was on the edge of financial collapse and suffering from internal political divisions. On the other side, Charles VI was suffering from a mental illness that handicapped the furthering of the war by the French government. Neither side was willing to concede on the primary cause of the war, the legal status of the Duchy of Aquitaine and the King of England's homage to the King of France through his possession of the duchy. However, both sides faced major internal issues that could badly damage their kingdoms if the war continued. The truce was originally negotiated by representatives of the kings to last three years, but the two kings met in person at Leulinghem, near the English fortress of Calais, and agreed to extend the truce to a twenty-seven years' period. Other provisions were agreed to, in attempts to bring an end to the Papal schism, to launch a joint crusade against the Turks in the Balkans, to seal the marriage of Richard to Charles' daughter Isabella along with an 800,000 franc dowry, and to guarantee to continue peace negotiations, in order to establish a lasting treaty between the kingdoms. The treaty brought peace to the Iberian peninsula, where Portugal and Castile were supporting the English and French respectively. The English evacuated all their holdings in northern France except Calais. The truce was the result of a decade of failed peace negotiations and inaugurated a thirteen years peace, the longest period of sustained peace during the Hundred Years' War. During the years following the truce, Richard reneged on his agreement to assist in ending the schism, leading the French to unilaterally withdraw from the obedience of either pope and seize Avignon by military force. French foreign policy also began to focus on Italy, and Genoa became a French protectorate. In England, Richard used the lapse in fighting to attack his political enemies and confiscate their lands, which he redistributed as rewards to his supporters. He then left for Ireland to put down a revolt among the Irish chieftains, but during his absence a number of his exiled opponents returned, led by his cousin Henry of Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster. Henry began an insurrection and seized most of England before Richard could return. Upon his return, Richard was imprisoned, and before he was starved to death he was forced to agree to abdicate. Henry was crowned in his place. The French initially interpreted events in England as a repudiation of the truce and raised an army and put garrisons in place on the fronts. Henry IV reaffirmed the truce which remained in place for several more years. Henry made a number of aggressive political moves against France in the following years, marrying Joanna, widow of the duke of Brittany in April 1402, and forming alliances with several German rulers, including a marriage alliance with Bavaria. Scotland was the first nation to break the truce, invading England in August in coordination with a revolt in Wales. The French reentered the conflict in September 1403, landing an army in Wales. Background In 1369 the French government repudiated the 1360 Treaty of Brétigny, resuming the Hundred Years' War between the kingdom of France and the kingdom of England and their various allies. The war originated over the King of England's status as both a French duke and also an English king, creating conflicting interests in many of his actions. The French had declared the English duchy in southwestern France forfeit, beginning the war. The English won the first phase, and the treaty granted the English possession of the duchy as a fief independent of France. During the ensuing decade of peace, the French government strengthened and determined to establish control over the duchy. For nearly two decades, the French pursued a military policy of avoiding direct battle with the English armies and wearing them down by attrition. Although the English won a few victories, eventually almost all of their gains from the earlier phases of the war were lost, including all of the Duchy of Aquitaine except for a narrow coastal strip from Bordeaux to the border of Navarre.Sumption, p. 774 By 1389 England was in the midst of political divisions. King Richard II, favoured making peace because the English parliament refused to grant sufficient funds to prosecute the war, the population had twice risen in revolt of the high taxation, and the nobility, led by his uncle the Duke of Gloucester, was attempting to subvert his control over the kingdom. France was also suffering from internal crisis. Charles VI was having recurring attacks of mental illness that paralyzed the government. During the 1380s a series of revolts occurred in the kingdom as a result of high taxation, beginning with the Harelle in 1383. As a result of these difficulties, the two kingdoms had been making attempts to negotiate a peace throughout the decade. Negotiations Richard II of England, ca 1390 In June 1389, high-level diplomats finished negotiations on a formal peace treaty in the town of Leulinghem, a town just outside Calais. England and its allies, Portugal, Ghent and the Duchy of Guelders, had been represented in the negotiations by John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, and Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester, the uncles of Richard II. France and its allies, the Kingdom of Castile and the Kingdom of Scotland, were represented by Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, and John of Valois, Duke of Berry, the uncles of Charles VI.Sumption, p. 805 The Kingdom of Aragon, several counties of the low countries, and the Duchy of Brittany had already made peace and became neutral in the conflict. The Holy Roman Empire nominally supported the English position but had remained neutral in the conflict. Lower level diplomats had been working out many of the details of the treaty in the years prior. France, overestimating England's ability to continue prosecuting the war, made major concessions, offering to return all the Duchy of Aquitaine to the English, except for the County of Poitou, permitting the English to maintain their fortress at Calais, and offering an indemnity of 1.5 million francs for English losses. In exchange, the King of England had to agree to do homage to the King of France in exchange for his duchy. The treaty would essentially restore to England everything lost in the course of the war except the full sovereignty of Aquitaine. Both delegations returned to their respective governments to have the treaty approved. In the interim, a three-year truce was agreed to go into effect on 18 July.Sumption, p. 807 Charles VI of France The French government was in effect led by the Duke of Burgundy since Charles VI's incapacity, and French approval was quickly granted. In England, Richard's political position was weak and the House of Commons of England in Parliament was controlled largely by the knights fighting the war.Sumption, p. 813 Richard feared open rebellion if he agreed to the treaty without the approval of Parliament, and called a session to consider the treaty. Parliament rejected the treaty, citing their fear of placing the king as a liege of the king of France and suggesting it would effectively make England a client kingdom of France. The Parliament also refused to grant a significant tax grant to continue funding the stalled war.Sumption, p. 814 Richard decided to enact a de facto peace with the French and use the interim to punish his political enemies.Sumption, p. 818 On 15 May 1395 he received a French embassy to negotiate with him personally. It was agreed that he would marry the six- year-old daughter of Charles, Isabelle, and Charles would provide a dowry of 800,000 francs and extend the truce by five years. In exchange Richard began evacuating the ports he controlled in northern France, surrendering them all except Calais. Brest and Cherbourg were only evacuated after substantial payments by the local nobility were made in exchange.Sumption, p. 823 The two kings agreed to meet in future and finalize negotiations. Charles, however, remained in a fragile mental state and was frequently unaware of his surroundings. He made a temporary recovery in 1396, and the two kings met privately at Leulinghem over the course of two days and made a number of commitments. They agreed to a joint crusade against the Turks in the Balkans, Richard agreed to support French attempts to end the Papal schism and formally accepted Isabelle as his wife and received his dowry. The truce was extended by another nineteen years, and both men agreed to continue negotiations towards a permanent peace. With negotiations complete, both kings returned to their respective capitals and the truce remained in effect.Sumption, p. 831 Aftermath In the aftermath of the treaty, Richard began executing revenge against his political enemies. Several men with large landed estates were dispossessed and executed or exiled. Their property was assigned to allies of Richard, who was attempting to create a block of allies in central England. Richard failed to send support for the crusade against the Turks; the French contingent, which contained many of France's prominent fighters, was annihilated at the Battle of Nicopolis in September 1396. Some of Richard's advisers suggested reopening the war, but he rejected the idea.Sumption, p. 834 Richard also repudiated his agreement to end the papal schism and continued to support the Roman pope over the Avignon pope. This led the French to unilaterally withdraw support for either pope and to seize Avignon by force.Sumption, p. 836 Richard's attacks against the landed nobility were met with hostility which remained suppressed for a time. After the death of John of Gaunt in 1399, Richard seized his duchy from his exiled son, Henry of Bolingbroke. Bolingbroke had taken up residence in Paris, where many of his fellow exiles began plotting a return to England.Sumption, p. 841 Richard left England to suppress a revolt in Ireland during 1399 and while he was away Henry led a small army back to England and seized his former estate by force. He quickly raised an army among the rest of the disaffected nobility and took control of most of England without force before Richard could return. Upon his return, Richard was forced to abdicate and was then starved to death. Henry was crowned King.Sumption, p. 862 French foreign policy shifted in the years following the truce, and the focus was placed on Italy as the French attempted to gain a foothold whereby they could force the Roman pope to abdicate. Genoa became a French protectorate. Charles's mental state continued to deteriorate, leading to more fighting in the court, with his wife allying with his uncles in opposition of Charles's brother, Louis of Orleans, Duke of Touraine. When Henry took the throne in England, the French initially interpreted it as a repudiation of the truce and raised an army and strengthened their garrisons on their borders. An embassy to England reconfirmed the truce with Henry.Sumption, p. 863 Repudiation Henry made a number of aggressive political moves toward France in the following years, marrying the dowager duchess of Brittany, Joan of Navarre in April 1402, making him duke of the two largest duchies with ties to France. The French responded by making one of Charles' sons Duke of Guyenne, a part of the Duchy of Aquitaine which the French claimed was forfeit. Henry formed alliances with several German states, including a marriage alliance with Bavaria. Scotland was the first nation to break the truce, invading England in August in coordination with a revolt in Wales. The Welsh revolt was likely influenced by the French. The French reentered the conflict in September 1403, landing an army in Wales. The thirteen-year truce was the longest period of peace between England and France in the Hundred Years' War. The war continued intermittently for another five decades.

Set in California in a dystopic alternate present, the novel portrays a world wracked by a sleeplessness pandemic caused by a prion. About ten percent of the population are infected, and, unable to find sleep, die painfully within a year. Society is on the verge of breakdown, and armed bands have turned much of the U.S. into a war zone. The novel follows Parker Haas, an idealist LAPD officer investigating the trafficking of \\"dreamer\\", the only drug capable of giving the sleepless temporary relief, and Jasper, an aging professional killer who crosses Haas' path. Reception The novel was generally well received by critics, with The Scotsman describing it as a \\"traditional police procedural tucked into a stunningly original work of speculative fiction\\". Strange Horizons welcomed the crime writer's first foray into speculative fiction, highlighting the novel's \\"coherent and exciting, familiar and wrongfooting\\" vision of a dystopic alternate present and Huston's \\"gift for dialogue and for moving the plot along\\", while noting that the seemingly desperate \\"grasping at coolness\\" of the setting and characters stretches plausibility.

So she jumps at the chance to fly solo, investigating the mysterious deaths of three young women in a nearby factory town as a favour to one of the agency's associates.

Like Germanic names, early Celtic names are often dithematic. Suffixes *suffix -rix \\"ruler\\" Ambiorix Boiorix Cingetorix Dumnorix Orgetorix Vercingetorix *suffix -maris / -marus \\"great\\" Britomaris Indutiomarus Viridomarus Celtic polytheism Some information on prehistoric Celtic polytheism can be drawn from names in Irish and Welsh mythology, which often continue older theonyms: *Gwenhwyfar, from *Uindā Seibrā \\"White Phantom\\" *Brigid, from *Brigantia \\"the High one\\" *Lugh and Lleu, cognate with Gaulish Lugus Surnames Many surnames of Gaelic origin in Ireland and the other Celtic nations, derive from ancestors' names, nicknames, or descriptive names. In the first group can be placed surnames such as MacMurrough and MacCarthy, derived from patronymics, or O'Brien and O'Grady, derived from ancestral names. Gaelic surnames derived from nicknames include Ó Dubhda (from Aedh ua Dubhda—Aedh, \\"the dark one\\"), O'Doherty (from Ó Dochartaigh, \\"destroyer\\" or \\"obtrusive\\"), Garvery (garbh, \\"rough\\" or \\"nasty\\"), Manton (mantach, \\"toothless\\"), Bane (bán, \\"white\\", as in \\"white hair\\"), Finn (fionn, \\"fair\\", as in \\"fair hair\\") and Kennedy (\\"cennedie\\", as in \\"ugly head\\") Very few Gaelic surnames are derived from placenames or venerated people/objects. Among those that are included in this small group, several can be shown to be derivations of Gaelic personal names or surnames. One notable exception is Ó Cuilleáin or O'Collins (from cuileann, \\"holly\\") as in the Holly Tree, considered one of the most sacred objects of pre-Christian Celtic culture. Another is Walsh (), meaning Welsh. In areas where certain family names are extremely common, extra names are added that sometimes follow this archaic pattern. In Ireland, for example, where Murphy is an exceedingly common name, particular Murphy families or extended families are nicknamed, so that Denis Murphy's family were called 'The Weavers' and Denis himself was called 'Denis \\"The Weaver\\" Murphy'. (See also O'Hay.) For much the same reason, nicknames (e.g. 'the Fada Burkes', \\"the long/tall Burkes\\"), father's names (e.g. 'John Morrissey Ned') or mother's maiden name ('Kennedy' becoming 'Kennedy-Lydon') can become colloquial or legal surnames. The Irish family of de Courcy descends from Anglo-Normans who came to Ireland following the Norman Conquest. (The name is of French derivation, and indicates that the family once held a manor of that name in Normandy.) The de Courcy family was prominent in County Cork from the earliest days of the Norman occupation and subsequently became prominent in Ireland.Families of County Cork, Ireland: Including English, Scots and Anglo- Norman Settlers, Michael C. O'Laughlin, Irish Roots Cafe, 1999 In addition to all this, Irish-speaking areas still follow the old tradition of naming themselves after their father, grandfather, great-grandfather and so on. Examples include Mike Bartly Pat Reilly (\\"Mike, son of Bartholomew, son of Pat Reilly\\"), John Michel John Oge Pat Breanach (\\"John, son of Michael, son of young John, son of Pat Breanach\\"), Tom Paddy-Joe Seoige (\\"Tom, son of Paddy- Joe Seoige\\"), and Mary Bartly Mike Walsh (\\"Mary, daughter of Bartly, son of Mike Walsh\\"). Sometimes, the female line of the family is used, depending on how well the parent is known in the area the person resides in, e.g. Paddy Mary John (\\"Paddy, son of Mary, daughter of John\\"). A similar tradition continues even in English-speaking areas, especially in rural districts. =Surname prefixes= * Bean: \\"Wife\\", pronounced . * De: \\"of the\\": a Norman- French habitational prefix used by some of the most common Irish surnames among which are De Búrca, Le Brún, De Barra, De Cíosóg, Devane and de Faoite. 'De' historically has signaled ownership of lands and was traditionally therefore a mark of prestige. * Mac (also Mc, M _c_ , M'c, and Mic): for most purposes, taken to mean 'son of', as in Mac Néill, 'son of Neil'. However, literally, the 'of' part does not come from the Mac prefix but from the patronymic that follows it. E.g., in the case of MacNéill, Mac merely means 'son'; Néill (meaning 'of Neil') is the genitive form of Niall ('Neil'). In some cases if the second word begins with a vowel, Mac then becomes Mag, as in Mag Eocháin. * Mhic: . Compressed form of bean mhic (\\"wife of the son of\\") e.g. Máire Mhic Néill (Máire, the wife of Mac Néill). This is the grammatically correct form of the prefix Mac always taken by a woman after marriage (e.g. a woman marrying someone of the surname Mac Néill would become Mhic Néill). Mhig (also pronounced ) is used similarly to Mag in some cases (e.g. Mag Shamhráin/Mhig Shamhráin). * Maol: In Pagan times this was expressed as Mug, as in the case of Mug Nuadat. The literal expression of this is \\"slave of Nuada\\", i.e. \\"devotee of Nuada\\". In the Christian era the word Mael was used in its place for given names such as Mael Bridget, Mael Padraig, Mael Lagan, Mael Sechlainn, and Mael Martain. In later times, some of these given names evolved into surnames, e.g. Ó Máel Sechlainn and Mac Mael Martain or Mael Lagan, which became after the 15th century the name Milligan. * Fitz: a Norman-French word derived from the Latin word filius (\\"son\\"). It was used in patronymics by thousands of men in the early Norman period in Ireland (e.g. fitz Stephen, fitz Richard, fitz Robert, fitz William) and only on some occasions did it become used as an actual surname, the most famous example being the FitzGerald Earls of Kildare. Yet well into the 17th and 18th century it was used in certain areas dominated by the Hiberno-Normans of Ireland in its original form, as a patronymic. The Tribes of Galway were especially good at conserving this form, with examples such as John fitz John Bodkin and Michael Lynch fitz Arthur, used even as late as the early 19th century. A number of illegitimate descendants of the British royal family were given surnames with this element: some of the illegitimate children of King Charles II were named FitzCharles or FitzRoy (\\"son of the King\\"); those of King James II were named FitzJames; those of Prince William, Duke of Clarence and St Andrews (later King William IV) were named FitzClarence. Note that \\"Fitzpatrick\\" is not Norman: it is actually a Normanisation of the Gaelic surname Mac Ghiolla Phádraig. * Ó: In Old Irish as ua (\\"grandson\\", \\"descendant\\"). E.g., the ancestor of the O'Brien clan, Brian Boru (937–1014) was known in his lifetime as Brian mac Cennéide mac Lorcán ('Brian, the son of Cennéide, the son of Lorcán'). Not until the time of his grandsons and great- grandsons was the name O'Brien used as a surname, used to denote descent from an illustrious ancestor. It has for some three hundred years been written as O, but in recent years the apostrophe is often dropped, bringing it into line with early medieval forms. The apostrophe came into existence as an error by the English, when in the process of anglicizing the surnames in Ireland, the accent above the O was mistakenly recognized as an apostrophe; it is sometimes popularly thought to be an abbreviation of 'Of'. * Uí: This is the plural of Ó and is used in reference to a kin-group or clan, e.g. Uí Néill, in reference to the O'Neill clan. It is pronounced . * Ní: This is used for women instead of Ó before a surname (e.g. Máire Ní Bhriain, \\"Mary O'Brien\\"), and comes from a shortened form of the Irish word for a daughter. * Nic: This is used for women instead of Mac, but only if this is their maiden name, never their married name. Compressed form of iníon mhic (\\"daughter of the son of/Mac…\\"), e.g. Máire Nic Charthaigh (\\"Mary, daughter of McCarthy\\"). Nig is used in cases where the surname uses Mag e.g. Nig Shamhráin.

Anthony Crawford (ca. 1865 - October 21, 1916) was an African American man killed by a lynch mob in Abbeville, South Carolina. Life Crawford was born early in the Reconstruction Era, c. 1865. After the Civil War, Crawford's father became the owner of a modest acreage of cotton fields on the Little River, about seven miles west of Abbeville, which he worked with his son. Anthony was an ambitious and literate child who routinely walked seven miles to the school in Abbeville. Crawford inherited the land on his father's death, which he increased by substantial land purchases in 1883, 1888, 1899 and 1903. In the mid or late 1890s, Crawford was co-founder of the Industrial Union of Abbeville County, which was devoted to the \\"material, moral and intellectual advance of the colored people\\". He was the father of twelve sons and four daughters. By 1916, his land holdings had expanded to 427 acres (as much as 600, according to some sources). Many of Crawford's children had settled on plots adjoining that of their father. With a net worth of approximately $20,000 to $25,000 in 1916 dollars, Crawford was without doubt one of the richest men in Abbeville County. Crawford was also known for his refusal to tolerate disrespect or defiance in any form. Once, when his church's preacher delivered a sermon decrying Crawford's meddling in church affairs, Crawford jumped out of his seat, struck the man and fired him on the spot. This extended even to whites: \\"The day a white man hits me is the day I die\\", he was quoted as having said to his children. After his death, the Charleston News & Courier (now the Post and Courier) described Crawford as \\"rich, for a negro, and he was insolent along with it\\".Charleston News and Courier, October 23, 1916 Lynching On October 21, 1916, Crawford was taking two loads of cotton and a load of seed into Abbeville and had a disagreement over the price of cottonseed with W.D. Barksdale, a white store owner. After Crawford left the store, one of Barksdale's employees followed him outside and hit him on the head with an ax handle. Crawford called for help, which drew the attention of Sheriff R.M. Burts. The officer arrested Crawford, most likely for his own protection, as a mob of angry whites was already beginning to accumulate. Crawford was held at the jail briefly, and released later that day on $15 bail. The police allowed him to exit from a side door, but the mob saw him anyway and pursued him into a cotton mill nearby, where Crawford took shelter in the boiler room. A salesman named McKinny Cann entered the boiler room after Crawford, and Crawford, grabbing a hammer from some nearby tools, knocked the man unconscious. Although the mill workers attempted to stop it, Crawford was stabbed and severely beaten by the mob. Sheriff R.M. Burts appeared and arrested Crawford once more, much to the chagrin of the mob of whites. The sheriff could only get Crawford away from the mob by promising to the brothers of Cann that he would not try to sneak Crawford out of town before the full extent of McKinny Cann's injuries was known. As it happened, Cann was not badly hurt, although Crawford was. He was treated by physician C.C. Gamble, who also happened to be the mayor of Abbeville, and also happened to be a relative of a man named James Rodgers who had been shot in December 1905 during an altercation with Crawford's sons. Gamble announced that Crawford would likely die from his wounds. Considering that Crawford might die before the mob could get to him, and concerned that the sheriff might spirit him out of town at 3 p.m., around 200 white men besieged the jail, captured and disarmed Sheriff Burts, and abducted Crawford. Crawford was dragged through the black section of town with a rope around his neck. The mob then stole a lumber wagon from a black driver and used it to take Crawford to a fairground nearby. Crawford, likely dead by that point, was hanged from a tree there, while armed whites riddled his body with bullets, rendering it to a \\"bloody pulp\\" by the \\"bloodthirsty\\" white mob that resented his wealth.\\"Black Property Owners in the South, 1790-1915, by Loren Schweninger, University of Illinois Press, 1990, pages 209 - 235. Retrieved November 5, 2019. The paper's headline the next day read \\"Negro Strung Up and Shot to Pieces\\". After dark, the county coroner, F.W.R. Nance, took a jury to the fairground and cut down Crawford's mutilated remains. The coroner found Crawford had died \\"at the hands of parties unknown\\", after which the Crawford family left the area, where they had lived for generations. Aftermath South Carolina governor Richard Irvine Manning III was quick to denounce the murder. He ordered a full investigation of the crime by both Sheriff Burts and State Solicitor Robert Archer Cooper, exhorting them to hand down indictments of the mob participants. Many Abbeville residents were held and questioned, including Cann's three brothers, but it became increasingly apparent that no resident of Abbeville would testify against any member of the mob; moreover it would be virtually impossible to select an impartial jury from the ranks of the city. Manning called for the trial's venue to be moved to a different county, although nothing came of it. Meanwhile, a document purportedly written by members of the lynch mob themselves was published in the Abbeville Scimitar: > We are ALL responsible for the conditions that caused Crawford's death. > Those involved might have gone too far, but they are white men and Crawford > was black.

Whether or not this document was genuine is open to question. The publisher of the Scimitar, William P. \\"Bull Moose\\" Beard, was a white supremacist. Beard and his editorials in the Scimitar openly ridiculed Governor Manning's attempts to bring any members of the mob to trial, writing that Crawford's murder was \\"inevitable and racially justifiable\\". Other newspapers in the area took a different tone, like the Press and Banner, which pointed out that by driving away cheap African American labor, the lynch mobs were bankrupting South Carolina farmers. These two facets of the debate were indicative of a growing schism in the South: middle- and upper-class whites were beginning to disapprove of lynchings, and the belief that lynch mobs were an \\"expansive luxury\\" the South could no longer afford was beginning to take root. In a civic meeting at the Abbeville courthouse on October 23, 1917, the white citizens of Abbeville, including many members of the lynch mob, voted to expel the remainder of Crawford's family from South Carolina, and to seize their considerable property holdings. They also voted to close down all the black- owned businesses in Abbeville. A consortium of white businessmen, worrying about the economic effect of such a decision, opposed these decisions. After the meeting, they personally spoke with Crawford's family and detailed the situation to them; the Crawfords agreed to leave by mid-November. This allayed the urgency of the voting whites at the courthouse, but it was just a delaying tactic. The white businessmen spent the intervening time building a consensus against the mob sentiment, and on November 6, 1917, they announced they had declared \\"war\\" on those who had voted to expel the Crawfords. Resolutions were passed to promise equal protection to citizens both black and white, denounce extrajudicial action, to bring up the possibilities that a local militia might be created, or that federal intervention might be invited, to prevent such activities in the future. Ultimately, however, though the murder occurred in broad daylight, over a period of hours, with hundreds of witnesses, no participant was ever prosecuted or even charged. Secondary motivation In addition to the racist motivations of those who wished to uphold the white status quo over an African American man who maintained a defiantly confident and aggressive posture in the presence of whites, and the generally poor tenor of race relations in Abbeville in general, historians have also speculated that the mob was partially motivated by a desire to humiliate and discredit Abbeville Sheriff R.M. Burts, and, by extension, Governor Manning, by local white politicians. Burts came from a wealthy family, and he had been unexpectedly appointed to his post by the comparatively enlightened and genteel Manning, despite Burts' lack of law enforcement qualifications. Many local white politicians were angered by this, and thought the job should have gone to Police Chief Joe Johnson. Coming up for election, Burts later defeated candidates Jess Cann (brother to McKinny Cann) and George White, two men who would play instrumental roles in the actions of the lynch mob. In the primary of South Carolina's gubernatorial election in July 1916, three months before Crawford's lynching, Manning had debated former governor (and future senator) of South Carolina Coleman Livingston Blease in Abbeville. Blease was known for his racist rhetoric, and he hurled invective at Manning's progressive approach toward race relations, claiming that this attitude had specifically incited a number of assaults by black men against white men and women. In the primary, Blease overwhelmingly took Abbeville County, but Manning narrowly won the state in a runoff election. An acolyte of Blease's, a young lawyer named Sam Adams, also made an unsuccessful run at state legislature. Perhaps to increase his local political fortunes, he bragged of his participation in the mob, and even that it was he who had placed the rope around Crawford's neck. Adams even specifically asked William Beard to print in his paper (the Scimitar) that Adams had been the ringleader of the group. Senate resolution In 2005, the 109th Congress of the United States Senate passed Resolution 39,Senate Resolution 39, (PDF) which was a formal apology to African Americans for Congress's failure to pass any kind of anti-lynching legislation despite over 200 anti-lynching bills having been introduced to Congress. The resolution was issued before the descendants of Anthony Crawford, among other surviving descendants of lynching victims, and marked the first occasion that Congress had apologized to African Americans for any reason, whereas Congress had in the past apologized to other ethnic groups, such as Japanese-Americans, for the actions of the United States.

Subversive Affirmation. On Mimesis as Strategy of Resistance. Editorial, spring 2006 issue of Maska, LjubljanaSylvia Sasse and Caroline Schramm. Totalitäre Literatur und subversive Affirmation. Welt der Slaven, 42, 1997, p. 306-327Inke Arns and Sylvia Sasse. Subversive Affirmation. On Mimesis as Strategy of Resistance. In: IRWIN: East Art Map, London / Ljubljana 2005 Simultaneously with affirmation, the affirmed concepts are revealed, and artists distance themselves from those concepts. Strategies of subversive affirmation include \\"over-identification\\", \\"over-affirmation\\" and \\"yes revolution\\". According to Inke Arns and Sylvia Sasse the methods of subversive affirmation have been developing in Eastern European art since the 1960s. Subversive affirmation was initially chosen because of the necessity to conform to socialist ideology, which is then adopted deliberately. In the late 80s these tactics were carried over to Western art and activism. The term \\"affirmation\\" was introduced by Moscow conceptualists to describe Vladimir Sorokin's novels. Sorokin exaggerated serious realism in the style of the 19th-century novel or in the style of socialist realism. Subversive affirmation is not a form of reverse psychology, in part, because it involves mimesis, but mostly because it does not operate according to a predetermined outcome and instead treats The Symbolic as part of the unconscious. It functions therefore in relation to an anonymous symbolic order and not in terms of individual ego psychology. The concept of subversive affirmation is often credited to the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek and his 1993 essay 'Why Are Laibach and the Neue Slowenische Kunst Not Fascists?' Slavoj Žižek, 'Why Are Laibach and Neue Slowenische Kunst Not Fascists?' in The Universal Exception: Selected Writings, Volume Two (London: Continuum, [1993] 2006) 63-66. In his essay Žižek made use of the psychoanalysis of Jacques Lacan to argue that in its musical and artistic performance, Laibach (band) was not providing an ironic imitation of official communist state ideology, but was frustrating the system by over-identifying with its obscene superego underside and manipulating the process of transference with the totalitarian state. For subversive affirmation to be effective, its address must be anonymous rather than targeted. In contrast to film theories that give a specific gender identification to Lacan's notion of the gaze, subversive affirmation emphasizes the inconsistency of symbolic mandates and the fact that there is no Big Other. This is why Laibach avoid both irony as well as the category of art. They also deny that what they do is intended to be subversive. Žižek's psychoanalytic approach to subversive affirmation and over-identification is applied to the study of the work of Michael Moore, IRWIN, The Yes Men, Atelier Van Lieshout, and Christoph Schlingensief in a book edited by the Dutch collective BAVO in 2007.BAVO, ed. Cultural Activism Today: The Art of Over- Identification (Rotterdam: Episode, 2007); see http://www.bavo.biz, https://www.academia.edu/4310492/_Cultural_Activism_Today_Strategies_of_Over- identification._book_review._OPEN._14 In Brave New Avant Garde, Marc James Léger develops Žižek's theory in relation to Lacan's concept of the Sinthome and the Discourse of the Analyst (Four discourses), arguing that Social practice (art) can in some cases be understood in its connection to the Avant- garde.http://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/good-old-avant-gardeMarc James Léger, Brave New Avant Garde: Essays on Contemporary Art and Politics (Winchester, UK: Zero Books, 2012) http://www.zero-books.net/books/brave-new- avant-garde Subversive affirmation is not to be confused with transgression, parody, deception or masquerade. It does not emerge from a place of aggression or as what the French philosopher Michel Foucault defines as a counter- discourse. In this sense Léger compares over-identification to Lacan's Discourse of the Analyst, as opposed to the Discourse of the Master or the Discourse of the Hysteric. In Surrealism, the use of conservative trappings, for example the illusionistic forms of representation in the paintings of René Magritte, or the Surrealists' bourgeois clothing and bureaucratic model of organization, could be thought of as antecedents to subversive affirmation. In an essay on the work of Hans Haacke, Fredric Jameson proposed that an art that acknowledges the logic of the image-world of late capitalism could be characterized as homeopathic, affirming the logic of the simulacrum to the point at which it is dialectically transformed into something else. Fredric Jameson, 'Hans Haacke and the Cultural Logic of Postmodernism' in Brian Wallis, ed. Hans Haacke: Unfinished Business (Cambridge: The MIT Press, 1986) 39-51. Much like Jameson's notion of cognitive mapping, subversive affirmation and over-identification are best conceived in terms of a critical mapping of ideology.

It is located in a lane just off the A60 road, just south of the village of Oldcotes on the road to Langold. History Hermeston Hall is situated on a site where a previous manor stood, built around 1100 AD for the Cress family who lived there until 1408. Bess of Hardwick was known to have been connected to the property in the 16th century. Foundations of the earlier house have been found under the floor. The site, however is believed to date back much further, given a Roman road runs through the land and a Roman villa was once situated in the vicinity of the house. After the English Civil War the property fell into decline and from 1765 the area fell under the ownership of the Mellish family who owned some of local land. The hall as it stands today was created in 1848 by Edward Challoner, a timber importer from Old Swan, Liverpool, who bought the house and some adjacent farmland and added a new south wing. It actually contains part of an older 16th century abbey on the rear side which was owned by the Riddell family. Edward Challoner left three daughters, one of whom, Catherine Flora, inherited the house and married Edward Charles Riddell. They added another two wings to create the square shape the house has today, with some 50 rooms. Reputed haunting A woman with red hair and black Elizabethan clothing resembling Bess of Hardwick is said to haunt the grounds Hermeston Hall is primarily known for its paranormal activity and reported ghost sightings. Ghostly Roman soldiers have apparently been spotted marching along the driveway, a woman with red hair and black Elizabethan clothes resembling Bess of Hardwick, and a man and a boy have been all been within the grounds. Phantom servants and children from the Victorian era are said to walk the corridors and the stairs and frequent the dining room. Unexplained phenomenon have been regularly experienced dining room and billiard room including hearing low voices, the smell of tobacco and a sense of being watched. The ghost of a little boy playing the piano has also been heard, a child's handprint on the window in the Chinese room and screaming children have been heard despite no children being near the property. The people who currently own the property have indicated that the Bishop's Room is haunted by a lady in white and an evil bishop, believed to be Edward Challoner and have claimed that a malevolent spirit haunts the attic to the hall. The mansion has been investigated by paranormal investigators who have caught unexplained orbs and red mists on camera and experienced unusually high EMF readings at Hermeston Hall. Most Haunted also visited the hall and it featured in one episode during Series 6. For the programme, the location was renamed 'The Ghost House'.

The community includes the villages of Bersham, Rhostyllen, Aberoer, Llwyneinion and Pentre Bychan, as well as a number of smaller settlements, the park at Erddig, and an area of the Ruabon Moors west of Aber- oer known as Esclusham Mountain. The population of the community at the 2011 Census was 3,515. History Cottages in Bersham. The name is recorded as Esclesham or Esclusham as early as 1315, likely originating in a combination of the Old English personal name Æscel with ham, \\"settlement\\"; the name is locally pronounced with stress on the second (middle) syllable, probably due to the influence of Welsh language stress patterns.Nomina, v. 11-13, 1987, 102 The old township of Esclusham, within the manor of Esclusham, was part of the historic Marcher Lordship of Bromfield and Yale.

In the western, rural part of the community the land rises to the high pastureland and moorland above Fron-deg and Aber-oer known as Esclusham Mountain.

He began his career as a concert pianist, but ultimately earned his place in Canadian history for establishing Toronto's first symphony orchestra of any standing, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra (no relation to the current orchestra of that name) which was active from 1906 to 1918. As a composer he wrote a few songs and some instrumental pieces, mostly works for solo piano. His grandson John Welsman is a notable film score composer and his granddaughter Carol Welsman is a successful jazz pianist and singer. Early life and education Born in Toronto, Welsman pursued courses in violin and piano performance at the Toronto College of Music before going to Leipzig in 1894 for further studies. His teachers included Richard Hofmann, Martin Krause, and Gustav Schreck. After completing his education, he returned to Canada in the spring of 1897. Some sources claim he studied the piano privately with Arnold Mendelssohn in Germany Career In 1897 Welsman returned to Toronto and commenced a career as a concert pianist, giving annual recitals in Toronto from 1897 until 1905. He also gave recitals in Ottawa, Brantford and Quebec. In 1905, while on an examining trip for the University of Toronto, he gave recitals in Winnipeg, Regina, Calgary, and Victoria. He had joined the piano faculty at the Toronto College of Music where he taught until 1906 when he left to join the faculty of the Toronto Conservatory of Music (TCM). He remained active as a concert pianist through 1907, after which he focused on his career as a conductor and educator. However, he did continue to play the piano in concerts of chamber music, particularly in concerts presented by the Welsman Studio Club, an organization he founded in 1914 which presented bi-weekly piano concerts performed by students and faculty of the TCM for over a decade. In 1906 Welsman formed the Toronto Conservatory Symphony Orchestra. Two years later the orchestra was reorganized to become a professional orchestra entitled the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, which Welsman conducted up through 1918. In the summers of 1923 and 1924 he worked in Huntsville, Ontario as the conductor for the Anglo-Canadian Leather Company Band. Welsman left the TCM to join the staff of the Canadian Academy of Music in 1918, but after six years there returned to the staff of the TCM in 1924 where he remained until his retirement in 1951. From 1928–1931 he served as music director of Alma College. Among his notable pupils were Roy Angus, G.D. Atkinson, Margaret Miller Brown, Percy Faith, H.K. Jordan, and Kate Bryce Marquis Nelson. He died in Muskoka, Ontario in 1952 at the age of 78. Sources *Frank Welsman at Encyclopedia of Music in Canada Frank Welsman, Canadian Conductor, by Mary E.

It is an inactive Anglican church in the deanery of Blackburn with Darwen, the archdeaconry of Blackburn, and the diocese of Blackburn , and is now up for sale. Originally a separate parish, in 2005 it combined with the parish of St Luke with St Philip to form the Parish of Christ the King. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History St Mark's is one of the oldest churches in the Blackburn diocese, and was founded by the Feilden family, the largest landowners in Blackburn at the time. Joseph Feilden gave the land for the church, contributed £200 towards its building and gave £50 for the stained glass windows. The church was built in 1836–38 to a Romanesque design by the Lancaster architect Edmund Sharpe. It was Sharpe's first commission, and one of his early churches in Romanesque style. In gaining the commission, he was helped by his older cousin Revd J. W. Whitaker, vicar of Blackburn, who was related by marriage to the Feilden family. The total cost of the church was £1,700 (equivalent to £ in ). In addition to the donations from Feilden, two grants were received; £400 from the Chester Diocesan Society for Building Churches, and £300 from the Incorporated Church Building Society. The new church seated a congregation of 669. The foundation stone was laid on 10 October 1836 by Joseph Feilden, and the church was consecrated on 10 June 1838 by Rt Revd John Bird Sumner, bishop of Chester, although it may have been finished before the latter date. In 1870 the south transept was added. This was designed by Sharpe's successor in the practice, E. G. Paley, to serve as a mausoleum for the Feilden family. Between 1881 and 1887 the church was restored by Paley and Austin who added the north transept and a vestry. Architecture The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner considered that this was \\"One of the most interesting churches in Blackburn\\". It is built in stone. The exterior is divided into a grid pattern by lesenes (pilasters without a base or capital) and string courses. The west front is gabled and has a gabled porch. Along the sides of the church are two tiers of windows, the upper ones being smaller and narrower than the lower ones. The plan of the church is cruciform. It consists of a wide nave without aisles that suddenly contracts into a narrow chancel with a polygonal apse. The north transept is five-sided, while the south transept is square. The tower rises from the junction of the nave and the chancel. It is octagonal with a small gable rising from each face, and is surmounted by a spire. Brandwood et al describe the church as a \\"curious building\\", and comment that the tower, arising as it does from the east end of the nave, creates a narrow passage internally, which reduces the view from the nave to the chancel. Inside the church is a west gallery with a late 20th-century screen supported by cast iron columns. The chancel screen is in Perpendicular style and dates from about 1920. The stained glass in the east window was designed by Thomas Willement and is dated 1838.

Biography Piero Bernocchi was born 13 September 1947, in Foligno, Italy. He participated as a protagonist in the Italian social movements of the 1960s and the 1970s, since the 1968 movement in which he was part of the Coordination team of the Departments of Science, of the Workers’ Committee and as leader of the movement at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Rome. Among the main representatives of the 77 movement, he was the director of a radio station Radio Città Futura, the first free Italian radio, which was the voice of the Italian movement between 1979 and 1985. He is the most important representative of the ‘alternative’ trade unionism in Italy, although his activity goes beyond trade unionism. This is because his organization, the Cobas, represents a unique organization that is involved in political, trade unionist, social and cultural initiatives and it rejects any form of separation among them. He contributed to the creation of the Cobas school unit, which started in 1987. He is still the spokesman of the Cobas school unit and of the Cobas Confederation. The latter includes the following units: School, Health, Public sector and Private sector. He played a main role in the organization of the World and European Social Forum against the liberal globalization movement starting from the first edition of the World Social Forum (WSF) in Porto Alegre in 2001 and of the European Social Forum (ESF) in Florence in 2002. He is also among the leaders of the ‘noglobal’ Italian movement, which was born in Genoa during the anti-G8 days in July 2001. He is still one of the most important representatives of WSF and of the ESF and he is a member of the International Council of the WSF.

He was a strong supporter of General Ibrahim Babangida, who had initiated the short-lived third republic.  Background  Ebri was born on 11 December 1952 in Mkpani, Yakurr Local Government Area, Cross River State. He studied at Sacred Heart College, Aba, the Community Secondary School, Ugep, and the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Before entering politics, Ebri was editor of the Nigerian Chronicle and Director of the Mercantile Bank of Nigeria, and the Savannah Bank of Nigeria. He was the Chief Executive of Brecon Associates, Inter-urban Contracting Services and Dimaron Nigeria Limited  Early political career  Ebri was elected into the 1989 Constituent Assembly, and in 1991 was elected as the Cross River state governor on the National Republican Convention platform, being forced out of office when General Sani Abacha took power as Head of State. He contested in the 1998 All People's Party (APP) primaries to become their candidate for Cross River state governor in the 1999 elections after the return to democracy, but came second. He was chairman of the Presidential Review Committee to examine the 1999 constitution, which made its report in 2001. One the committee's recommendations, which was not accepted, was to limit presidential and governorship terms to one single 5-year period.  Progressive Peoples Alliance Chairman  In 2006, Ebri left the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) to become a founding member of the Progressive Peoples Alliance (PPA), becoming national chairman. In May 2006 Ebri urged the Federal Government to reform the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to ensure free and fair elections in 2007. After the 2007 elections, he led the party into the Government of National Unity (GNU) under President Umaru Yar'Adua, while reserving the right to withdraw if problems arose. He said the PPA had not compromised in joining the GNU, but said \\"we felt we should as well help to stabilize the polity, and add value to governance.\\" In February 2009 he praised the decision of the Appeal Court in Port Harcourt, Rivers State which had annulled the decision of the Abia State Elections Tribunal to replace Theodore Orji of the PPA as governor by Onyema Ugochukwu of the PDP. In April 2009 he asked the INEC to announce the result of the Ekiti State supplementary election immediately, and also called on police to release election monitors who were detained while performing their job during the election. In August 2009, two weeks after Imo State Governor Ikedi Ohakim had defected from the PPA to the PDP, Ebri resigned from the PPA chairmanship and left the party, saying he was stepping aside from politics.

The event brings together law firms, in house counsel, government attorneys, legal vendors, residents, parents, children and athletes of all levels of experience, to raise awareness and public consciousness regarding heart disease and stroke. Since its inception in 1991, Lawyers Have Heart has raised over $13 million to benefit the AHA and further its mission to be a relentless force for a world of longer, healthier lives. LHH is now one of the largest annual philanthropic endeavors supported by the greater DC legal community and has grown to become the area's largest 10K race. The event has a fundraising goal of $1.3 million for the 2019 event taking place on Saturday, June 8, 2019 at 7:10 AM in Washington, D.C.http://lawyershaveheartdc.org/  History  LHH was founded nearly 30 years ago by two Washington lawyers: Richard Frank, founder and senior principal of OFW Law and Alan Raul, partner at Sidley Austin LLP. When John W. Sansing published a 1990 cover article in the Washingtonian (magazine) entitled \\"First, Kill All the Lawyers,\\" Frank decided to take action to improve the public image of lawyers by creating LHH. Frank recruited Raul, then general counsel to the United States Department of Agriculture, to assist him in the endeavor. As a longtime runner whose father was afflicted with heart disease, Frank saw the race as \\"a double good\\" – to raise money for the AHA and \\"show that the Washington legal community has some heart.\\"\\"Leading Lawyers: Eleven of the D.C. Area's Top Food and Drug Attorneys,\\" LegalTimes, 19 Sept 2005, Vol. XXVIII, No. 38. Print.

Advertisement. LegalTimes. 18 Jul 1994. Print. The first annual Lawyers Have Heart 10K Run and Fun Walk took place on May 19, 1991, and featured two Olympic marathon trials qualifiers in Darrell General and Jim Hage. After just one mile, General and Hage were in a head-to-head battle as they outpaced the trailing runners. The final decision was down to the wire, with General taking the honors by 13 seconds, 30:45 to 30:58. Linda Portazikc, of Arlington, Virginia, was the first woman to cross the finish line that year, establishing a mark of 36:47. The longest-standing record on the LHH books was set the following year, in 1992, by Charlotte Thomas, of Baltimore, Maryland, with a time of 34:42. Philippe Rolly is the only four-time winner of the LHH 10K. Beginning in 1999, when he moved from Lyon, France, to the Washington area, he was victorious in three consecutive races with times of 32:22, 31:34, and 30:49. Rolly also won in 2004 with a mark of 31:23. Donna Moore, of Silver Spring, MD, became the first woman to win twice after first-place finishes in 1999 (37:22) and 2001 (37:17). In 2018, Lawyers Have Heart offered a $20,000 purse, attracting local and international talent. This resulted in two record breaking 10K times in the male and female elite divisions (Andrew Colley (28:45) & Etagegn Woldu Mamo (33:13)). In addition, Olympian hopeful Demssew Abebe, participated in the 2018 race. The race has grown substantially over time, along with the proportion of female participants. In 1992, women accounted for 32% (333) of the 1,038 runners who crossed the finish line whereas, in 2018, women comprised 55% of the 5,500 finishers. During LHH's first two years, the race was held in West Potomac Park, Washington, DC. In 1993, however, the race shifted to a hilly area in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, where it would remain until 2002, when the direction of the course was reversed in order to avoid such hilly terrain.

Relatively flat and scenic, the race course begins and ends at the Washington Harbour, in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., and follows the Potomac River past many historic sites. Walkers start at the same location as the race does, immediately following the runners. However, their course only follows the Potomac River to the Lincoln Memorial, before returning to the Washington Harbour. Baby joggers, strollers, and pets are welcome on the walking course. Following the race, there is a Finish Line Festival at the Washington Harbour, and participants and spectators can enjoy refreshments, music, giveaways and prizes provided by friends and sponsors of LHH. =Other LHH Races= The success of the Lawyers Have Heart 10K and Fun Walk has led to the launch of similar LHH races, some of which are affiliated with the AHA around the country, such as in Boston, MA, where the fourth annual Lawyers Have Heart 5K Road Race and Summer Celebration was held on Thursday, June 9, 2011, at the Bank of America Pavilion. Other cities that have held Lawyers Have Heart races include San Diego, CA, Fresno, CA, and West Palm Beach, FL.  References   External links  * Lawyers Have Heart Webpage * 2017 Washington D.C.

It is characterized by its random position of collagen fibers. In most places in adults this tissue is replaced by secondary bone tissue except, for example, near the sutures of calvara or tooth sockets. The secondary bones have lower amounts of osteocytes so primary bone is much more easily penetrated by x-ray. Clinical significance Primary bone or the primary ossification center is the beginning of the bone building process during the first trimester. Calcificed cartilage is basophilic and new bone being made is more acidophilic. The primary ossification occurs in the diaphysis. In contrast, secondary ossification centers appear later at the epiphyses of the cartilage and develop similarly to the diaphysis.Junqueria's Basic Histology Text & Atlas = Cancer = Primary bone cancer is a type of sarcoma, a cancer that originates in bone, muscle, fibrous tissue, blood vessels, fat tissue, as well as some other tissues.

It was demolished in 1955 and its stakes races moved to Woodbine Racetrack as part of a consolidation of racetracks in the Toronto area. The track was owned by Abe Orpen and his family after his death. Only in length, it was also called Little Saratoga. The site is now a shopping centre. History Dufferin Park Racetrack, 1909 William James. After a provincial racing charter was granted in 1894 to the York Riding and Driving Association to operate horse racing and sell liquor, a half-mile track was laid out on of land on the west side of Dufferin Street owned by Charles Leslie Denison. After Denison died, Abraham \\"Abe\\" Orpen leased the land from Denison for per year and opened Dufferin Racetrack in 1907. Horse race gambling was controversial at the time and the charter was revoked in 1909, although this was due to a legal technicality as the charter had not been used for several years prior to 1907. Orpen appealed to Canadian Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier directly and was granted a federal charter. Orpen, along with other businessmen incorporated the Metropolitan Racing Association of Canada, under a federal racing charter, which allowed betting on the site beyond provincial controls. The Association was originally capitalized for , divided into 40 shares of $100 and six of $10. The track had its stables to the south of the track, along with a winter barn which was also used for offices. The public entrance was at the south-east corner of the property, through the stable yard. Betting was handled by bookmakers who operated in front of the grandstand and in the infield, and bets were also made on races at other tracks. Admission was charged to the patrons, although free admission was granted after the first few races. Racing was held into November, and often races were held in the dim light of the evening. Judges would hold lanterns to judge the finishing order. In one infamous incident during these \\"midnight races\\" a long-shot horse named Mulock held up at the turn and waited until the horses made a lap of the track and then raced to the finish ahead of the others. Despite the controversy, the bets on Mulock were paid. The track was a financial success, one of several successful tracks in the Toronto area. In 1916, Orpen opened the Kenilworth Park Racetrack in Windsor, Ontario. In 1917, Orpen was an investor in the Thorncliffe Park Raceway. In 1924, Orpen opened the Long Branch Racetrack in Etobicoke Township, just north of the village of Long Branch. Orpen renewed the lease in 1925 and purchased the track a few years later. After Orpen died in 1937, his son Fred Orpen took over and operated the racing syndicate. Fred would play the national anthem on a piano on the public address system every meet day at Dufferin to start the day. During World War II, Long Branch was closed and some of its stakes races were held at Dufferin Park. From 1942–45, the Canadian International Stakes and the Cup and Saucer Stakes were run at Dufferin Park. Thorncliffe closed in 1952 and the Orpen tracks were sold to E. P. Taylor and closed down in 1955, with racing consolidated at the new Woodbine Racetrack. Taylor paid a reported million for the Orpen's tracks and racing charters and transferred them to the Ontario Jockey Club on December 1, 1955. The final race was on November 8, 1955, won by Honeybelloo. The Dufferin Mall is located on the site today. After the sale, Fred Orpen got out of the horse-racing business completely. He built an estate on of land near Alton, which he sold in 1972 to develop a housing sub-division. He died on October 28, 1978 at the age of 82. Other uses The site was also used as the location for an annual travelling circus. It was used by local high school Central Commerce Collegiate for athletics meets. From 1951, the site was also used for a musical theatre production in a tent, called Melody Fair.

Ar gouriz koar  Prigent's first album, Ar gouriz koar (translated The Wax Belt), was released in 1993 on Auvidis/Silex. A second version of the album was recorded and released in 1996 on Barclay Records after a lawsuit between Prigent and Auvidis/Silex over the proceeds from the album sales. The title comes from the song \\"Ur vag a Vontroulez\\", in which a woman pledges a gift of wax to Saint John if he saves her son from the wretch.

He played His assassination at the hands of the Slovenian Communist secret police (VOS) during World War II was an important event in the escalation of the armed conflict between the Slovenian partisans and the Slovenian anti-revolutionary forces in the Province of Ljubljana. The role of Natlačen during World War II and the extent to which he collaborated with the Fascist Italian forces has been disputed. Biography Natlačen was born in the village of Manče in the upper Vipava Valley, in what was then the Duchy of Carniola within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Natlačen finished his law studies in Vienna and then moved to Ljubljana, where he worked in a law firm. He was a member of the Slovene People's Party and an anticommunist. During the Second World War he founded the National Council of Slovenia () together with the leaders of other political parties.Sirc, Ljubo. 1992. Med Hitlerjem in Titom. Ljubljana: Državna založba Slovenije, p. 14–15. On May 4, 1941, the day after the Italians annexed the Province of Ljubljana to Italy, Natlačen and a number of other Slovene politicians wrote a letter to Mussolini, congratulating him on the act. Emilio Grazioli) He initially accepted a position on the Italian- establish advisory council for the Province of Ljubljana, and on June 8 led a delegation to meet with Mussolini in Rome, after which he wrote Mussolini another letter expressing \\"complete loyalty\\". But he resigned later that year since he saw the Italians were not interested even in any advice from the council and his opposition to the Italian authorities and their unlawful treatment of people in the Province of Ljubljana. Together with the Albert Kramer of the Liberal Party, he helped draft the London Points () in October 1941, which stated that the goals of Slovene prewar parties was the renewal of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and designed that Chetnik army of Draža Mihailović as the only legal force, while all others, including the Partisans, were declared treasonousRant, Jože. 2008. Slovenski eksodus leta 1945. Buenos Aires: M. Loboda, p. 57. In 1942 Natlačen played a key role in establishing the MVAC, a Slovene collaborationist militia that fought under the command of the Italian forces, having written in May 1942 a memorandum to the Italians suggesting the creation of such units. Natlačen was still the internal leader of the Slovene People's Party, when the party's army, the Slovene Legion, joined the Italian MVAC forces, to jointly fight against the Partisans. He was assassinated by the communist secret police (VOS, Security and Intelligence Service) at the order of the Communist Party of Slovenia. Reflecting his importance to the collaborationist cause, the Fascist authorities in retaliation for Natlačen shot 24 Slovene hostages, suspected supporters of the Liberation Front. After the war the communist authorities desecrated his grave, exhumed his remains, and disposed of them at an unknown location.  Controversies  Natlačen published the anti-Serb xenophobic poem Srbe na vrbe (Hang the Serbs on the Willow Trees) in the Ljubljana newspaper Slovenec on 27 July 1914, the day before Austria-Hungary declared war against the Kingdom of Serbia.Gestrin, Ferdo, & Vasilij Melik. 1950.

Rather than lay formal siege to the port, the Prussians cut it off by land and blockaded it. They were unable to cut it off by sea, owing to a lack of a Prussian fleet, and eventually the blockade was abandoned when the bulk of Prussian forces were withdrawn to fight in other theatres. Background Sweden had entered the Seven Years' War in 1757, joining France, Russia, Austria and Saxony in their alliance against the Prussians. During Autumn 1757, with Prussian forces tied up elsewhere, the Swedes had been able to move south and occupy a large portion Pomerania. Following the retreat of the Russians from East Prussia, after the Battle of Gross- Jägersdorf, Frederick the Great ordered his General Hans von Lehwaldt to move west to Stettin to confront the Swedes. The Prussian troops proved to be better equipped and trained than the Swedes, and were soon able to push them back into Swedish Pomerania.Szabo p. 92 The Prussians pressed home their advance, taking over Ancland and Demmin. The Swedes were left at the stronghold of Stralsund and the island of Rügen.Millar & Hook p. 7 Fredrik von Rosen was sent out to take over command of the Swedish forces.Szabo p. 92 Blockade As Stralsund was not about to surrender it became apparent that the Prussians required naval support if they were to force it to yield. In light of this Frederick repeatedly requested that his British allies send a fleet into the Baltic Sea. Wary of being drawn into conflict with Sweden and Russia, with whom they were not at war, the British declined. They justified their decision by explaining their ships were needed elsewhere.Atkin p.111 The failure of Frederick to gain fleet support from the Royal Navy was a major factor in the failure of the Prussians to take Stralsund. During this period the Prussians forcibly recruited men from occupied Swedish Pomerania.Szabo p. 122 The French had to keep the Swedish war effort afloat both by paying them subsidies, and by paying Denmark not to enter the war on Prussia's side.Szabo p. 132–3 Aftermath When the 1758 campaigning season commenced, the Prussian forces around Stralsund were needed more urgently on the Russian front and were mostly withdrawn - bringing an effective end to the blockade. It wasn't until after the Prussians had suffered a major defeat at Battle of Kunersdorf in 1759 and their forces were once again tied down on other fronts that the Swedes again went on the offensive again and won the Battle of Frisches Haff.Oakley p. 140 In spite of this the Swedes made only limited progress and in 1762, when the Russians pulled out of the war, the Swedes made peace with the Prussians by the Treaty of Hamburg.

This giving of articles, clothing, and money is an important part of the Indian wedding. This practice is an age old tradition and even today in the modern times it is considered to be an earthly treasure.

Constructed in 1921, the building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  History  Originally the US National/Guaranty Bank Building, the Bank Lofts (also known as the United States National Bank Building, US National Bank Building, Guaranty Bank Building) were designed by Arthur Addison Fisher and William Ellsworth Fisher (Fisher & Fisher) and built in 1921. The Fishers also designed other notable Denver landmarks, such as the Denver City Tramway Building at 1100 14th Street and the A. C. Foster Building at 912 16th Street. Located at 817 17th street, the Bank Lofts are a reserved architectural example of the Chicago Commercial style. The 10-story (40.23 meters high) building's façade is covered in smooth ashlar limestone and features an ornamental bronze storefront. In the 1980s, the building sat vacant and was almost demolished, but on March 25, 1994 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places under the Historic Resources of Downtown Denver Multiple Property Submission (building number: 5DV.5300), and was subsequently renovated in 1995. The renovation costs exceeded $10.9 million, and were financed via historic rehabilitation and low-income housing tax credits and a grant from the Colorado Historical Society, along with TIF assistance from DURA. The building was reconfigured into renter-occupied apartment lofts in 1996. Today, The Bank Lofts reside in Denver's historic district, located in the heart of downtown Denver next to LoDo and the 16th Street Mall.

Condor History In 1893 Edouard Scheffer and Victor Donzelot made their first bike for the Swiss military in their new factory under the name Sheffer Freres. In 1899 the company picked a logo showing the large birds of the Andes, the Condor. Later the factory was renamed Condor-Werke AG. They produced civilian but more often government bikes until the 1990s. Some engines were built in house, but the last Swiss built engine was made in the early 1960s. The A350 engine In 1967 Ducati's successful 350 scrambler motor was selected for use in the new Swiss military motorcycle. At first plans were to just import the engine block but later plans were changed to import the whole engine, although there was some Swiss tinkering. The exhaust port and assembly was made more robust. The steel exhaust pipe and muffler were built to run almost silently and the whole assembly is sprayed with aluminum. The oil filler cap changed to a longer tube to make filling easier. Compression was reduced to 8.2:1 so that the bike could run on poor quality fuel. The result is a reliable engine that made only 16.6 hp, and it will do about 70 miles per hour. The oil filter was mounted remotely. Frame and chassis The forks were sourced from Marzocchi. Early models have Marzocchi rear shocks but later ones are fitted with Konis. Wheels and 200mm drum brakes from Grimeca, adequate for use on the Alps. Both rims are the same but the front tire is a 3.25x18” and the rear is a 3.50x18”. The headlight and a few other electrical components were supplied by Bosch. A major difference between the Swiss bike and the Italian was rubber mounting the engine – very different from the stressed member design. It was heavier but a lot smoother on the rider. One oddity is that the frame has a lug for a standard Ducati side stand, but one was never supplied by the factory. Accessories The A350 comes with leather saddle bags and a few odd military accessories. One is the blackout light for night riding, and the other is mounts for two SIG 57 assault rifles. The side covers house a large air filter and spare bulbs and fuses in a foam block, and the other side contains a tool set, a lock, a cleaning brush, and goggles. Production Condor made 500 A350s in 1973 and when the production run ended in 1978, 3000 had been made.

Life He was the son of Daniel G. Rollins (1796–1875), Judge of Probate of Strafford Co. 1857-66, and Susan Binney (Jackson) Rollins (b. 1805). He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1860. Then he studied law at Harvard Law School, was admitted to the bar, and commenced practice in Portland, Maine. From 1866 to 1869, he was an Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and removed to New York City. Afterwards he resumed his private practice. In 1873, his former fellow Asst. U.S. Attorney Benjamin K. Phelps took office as New York County District Attorney and appointed Rollins an Assistant D.A. On December 31, 1879, Rollins was the Republican candidate for Recorder of New York City, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of John K. Hackett, but the Board of Supervisors elected Tammany man Frederick Smyth. In November 1880, Rollins ran on the Republican and the German Independent tickets for Recorder of New York, but was again defeated by the incumbent Recorder Smyth. On January 10, 1881, Rollins was appointed by Gov. Alonzo B. Cornell as D.A. of New York to fill the vacancy caused by the death of D.A. Phelps, and remained in office until the end of 1881. In November 1881, Rollins declined to run to succeed himself as D.A., and was instead elected Surrogate of New York County. He was re-elected in 1884, and remained in office until the end of 1887. In 1884, Dartmouth College conferred an honorary degree of LL.D. on him. In November 1887, he ran for the New York Supreme Court (1st D.) but was defeated. Afterwards he resumed his private practice. One of his last cases was the defense of the owners of the American Tobacco Company who were charged with \\"conspiracy and violation of the Penal Code\\", meaning that they had formed a monopoly. Rollins died from diabetes at the place of his birth which he used then as his summer home, on Beacon Street in Somersworth, N.H. (previously named Great Falls), and was buried in that city. His brother Edward Ashton Rollins was Speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives in 1861 and 1862. Congressman Edward H.

It is an output nucleus whose fibres project to thalamic nuclei, such as the ventral anterior nucleus, the ventral lateral nucleus, and the medial dorsal nucleus. The VP is a core component of the reward system which forms part of the limbic loop of the basal ganglia, a pathway involved in the regulation of motivational salience, behavior, and emotions. It is involved in addiction. The VP contains one of the brain's pleasure centers, which mediates the subjective perception of pleasure that results from \\"consuming\\" certain rewarding stimuli (e.g., palatable food). Anatomy The ventral pallidum lies within the basal ganglia, a group of subcortical nuclei. Along with the external globus pallidus, it is separated from other basal ganglia nuclei by the anterior commissure. Limbic loop The limbic loop is a functional pathway of the basal ganglia, in which the ventral pallidum is involved. It (and the internal globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars reticulata) receives input from the temporal lobes, and the hippocampus via the ventral striatum. The information is relayed to the medial dorsal and ventral anterior nuclei of the thalamus. Role in addiction The ventral pallidum receives dopaminergic inputs from the ventral tegmental area. The ventral pallidum also receives GABAergic inputs from the nucleus accumbens. It acts in part as a relay nucleus from the nucleus accumbens to the medial dorsal nucleus. The nucleus accumbens projects to the medial dorsal nucleus via GABAergic medium spiny neurons. The rewarding effects of addictive drugs are mediated in part through their effect on the VP.

TerraPower is developing a class of nuclear fast reactors called the traveling wave reactor (TWR).RIL buys stake in US's Terra Power , www.moneycontrol.com The TWR concept places a small core of enriched fuel in the center of a much larger mass of non-fissile material, in this case depleted uranium. Neutrons from fission in the core \\"breeds\\" new fissile material in the surrounding mass, producing Pu239. Over time, enough fuel is bred in the area surrounding the core that it begins to undergo fission as well, sending neutrons further into the mass and continuing the process while the original core burns out. Over a period of decades, the reaction moves from the core of the reactor to the outside, thus giving the name \\"travelling wave\\". In September 2015, TerraPower signed an agreement with the state-owned China National Nuclear Corporation to build a prototype 600 MWe reactor unit at Xiapu in Fujian province, China from 2018 to 2025. Commercial power plants, generating about 1150 MWe, were planned for the late 2020s. However, in January 2019 it was announced that the project had been abandoned due to technology transfer limitations placed by the Trump administration. In October 2020, the company was chosen by the United States Department of Energy as a recipient of a matching grant totaling between $400 million and $4 billion over the next 5 to 7 years for the cost of building a demonstration reactor of their \\"Natrium\\" design, which uses liquid sodium as a core coolant (this reduces the cost by having a non-pressurized primary loop). It then transfers that heat to molten salt which can be stored in tanks and used to generate steam for electricity production on demand, enabling the reactor to run continuously at constant power while allowing the electricity generation from the power station to be dispatchable.  Traveling wave reactor  TerraPower has chosen traveling wave reactors (TWRs) as its primary technology. The major benefit of such reactors is high fuel utilization in a manner that does not require nuclear reprocessing and could eventually eliminate the need to enrich uranium. TWRs are designed to convert typically non-fissile fertile nuclides such as U-238 into fissile nuclides like Pu-239 in-situ and then shift the power from the highly burned region to the freshly bred region, as an integrated breeder reactor. This allows the benefits of a closed fuel cycle without the expense and proliferation-risk of enrichment and reprocessing plants typically required to get them. Enough fuel for between 40 and 60 years of operation could be in the reactor from the beginning. The reactor could be buried below ground, where it could run for an estimated 100 years. TerraPower described the concept of its main reactor design as a \\"Generation IV, liquid sodium-cooled fast reactor\\". = Environmental effects = By using depleted uranium as fuel, the new reactor type could reduce stockpiles from uranium enrichment. TerraPower notes that the US hosts 700,000 metric tons of depleted uranium and that 8 metric tons could power 2.5 million homes for a year. Some reports claim that the high fuel efficiency of TWRs, combined with the ability to use uranium recovered from river or sea water, means enough fuel is available to generate electricity for 10 billion people at US per capita consumption levels for million-year time-scales. = Research and development = The TWR design is still in the research and development phase. The conceptual framework of the TWR operations was simulated by supercomputers with an empirical evidence for theoretical feasibility. US regulators postponed the construction of the experimental reactor for a decade over extended documentation for its certification process. On November 6, 2009, TerraPower executives and major investor Bill Gates visited Toshiba's Yokohama and Keihin Factories in Japan, and concluded a non-disclosure agreement with them on December 1.Bill Gates, Toshiba in early talks on nuclear reactor, Sydney Morning Herald, March 23, 2010 Toshiba had already developed an ultracompact reactor, the 4S, that can operate continuously for 30 years without fuel handling and generates 10 megawatts. Some of the technologies used in 4S are considered to be transferable to TWRs.  Alternative designs  , the company is also investigating a molten salt reactor design with Southern Company as an alternative technology.  Company information TerraPower is partly funded by the US Department of Energy and Los Alamos National Laboratory. One of TerraPower's primary investors is Bill Gates (via Cascade Investment).

This incident grew into an 11-alarm fire, not brought under control until 24 hours later, and resulted in the death of eight firefighters of the Philadelphia Fire Department (PFD), injuries to 14 other firefighters, and the loss of four PFD vehicles. At the height of this fire, the loss of the huge, sprawling refinery complex was regarded as a real possibility as a tremendous firestorm enveloped two storage tanks, travelled through portions of the on- site piping, and destroyed the refinery's administration building.  Before the fire  The Girard Point Refinery, built in 1905, occupied of land located on the east bank of the Schuylkill River, from Girard Point in the south to Penrose Avenue in the north, with the ARCO Point Breeze Refinery located on the north side of Penrose Avenue and extending toward Passyunk Avenue. An elevated section of Penrose Avenue passes between the refineries site, leading to the Penrose Avenue Bridge, connecting the east and west sides of the Schuylkill River. At the time of 1975 fire, the Girard Point Refinery (the refinery) produced per day of refined petroleum products. Prior to August 17, 1975, the refinery had been the scene of ten extra-alarm fires since 1960. On September 9, 1960, several storage tanks were struck by lightning at the height of severe thunderstorms and resulted in an eight-alarm fire. On May 16, 1975, a six-alarm fire struck the refinery. At 12:45 a.m. on the morning of Sunday, August 17, 1975, the tanker M/T Afran Neptune, tied up at one of the Gulf Refinery docks, began pumping reconstituted Venezuelan crude oil (with an additional 5 percent naphtha) into Gulf Refinery Tank No. 231. Tank No. 231, built in 1929, of riveted seam construction, had a capacity of and had recently been renovated with an internal floating roof. Within the refinery's road system, the tank was located at Avenue “Y” and 4th Street. Avenue “Y” is an east-west street running parallel to and just to the north of the Penrose Avenue Bridge, while 4th Street is a north-south street running perpendicular to the Penrose Avenue Bridge and Avenue Y. Located just west of Tank No. 231 was Boiler House No. 4, the site of a four-alarm fire on April 22, 1967. A brick chimney arose from Boiler House No. 4 and this stack was a familiar sight to westbound motorists on the Penrose Avenue Bridge, as the word “GULF” was painted in large, white letters.  The fire  Hydrocarbon vapors, emanating from Tank 231, accumulated in the area of the boiler house and were ignited by an unknown ignition source. A flame front followed the vapors back to Tank 231, causing fire at the tank's vents and an explosion within the outer shell of the stack. These events began to unfold at 5:57 a.m. Shortly thereafter, a second explosion occurred within Tank 231. Burning petroleum spilled from the tank's vents into a diked area surrounding the tank. Within the diked area, a second tank (No. 114) just north of Tank 231, containing No. 6 grade fuel oil, also ignited as pipelines within the diked area began to fail. The initial explosion also damaged the pipe manifold outside of the dike wall and petroleum pouring out under pressure ignited. = 1st and 2nd alarms = At 6:04 a.m., upon receiving the report of fire from the Gulf Refinery, the Philadelphia Fire Department transmitted the refinery's fire alarm box: Box 5988, Penrose and Lanier Avenues. Upon leaving their station, Engine 60 (the assigned first-due engine company) could see fire and smoke conditions at a distance, and before arriving at the refinery, Engine 60 ordered the second alarm at 6:09 a.m. = 3rd to 6th alarms = First arriving companies had large clouds of heavy black smoke emanating from Tank No. 231, fire on top of Tank No. 114, and fire showing from the stack at Boiler House No. 4. The third and fourth alarms were ordered in quick succession by Battalion Chief 1, Arthur Foley, at 6:11 a.m. and 6:14 a.m. Acting Assistant Fire Chief Dalmon Edmunds ordered the fifth alarm at 6:34 am. The sixth alarm was ordered by Fire Commissioner Joseph Rizzo at 6:52 a.m. Over the next several hours, firefighters utilized deluge guns and master streams to cool down surrounding exposures, and applied foam directly to the burning tanks and piping in an effort to extinguish the fire. By 8:44 a.m., it appeared that the fire was well contained and the situation sufficiently stabilized to declare the fire under control. Commissioner Rizzo remained on the firegrounds throughout the warm, muggy August day to continue to oversee the firefighting operation. Philadelphia's two foam pumpers, Engines 160 and 133, along with the Gulf Refinery's foam pumper, continued to apply foam to the burning tank, piping and manifolds. Additional foam was acquired throughout the day from the fire department's warehouse and the nearby Atlantic Richfield refinery. It was also obtained from the National Foam Company in West Chester, Pennsylvania. However, as the firefighting operation progressed, it became apparent that the refinery's sewage system was not up to the task of properly draining the foam, water and petroleum-naphtha product mixture that was accumulating on the ground along Avenue Y, between 4th Street and 5th Street to the east, running in front of the refinery's administration building. These drainage problems were further exacerbated by a decision by refinery personnel to shut off drainage pumps. These pumps were shut off as part of a decision to de-energize overhead power lines that ran adjacent to Tank 231 along 4th Street. As the liquid mixture continued to build up in Avenue Y, Engines 16 and 40 were sent to Avenue Y and 5th Street to draft from a sewer intake and pump the material to a diked area some distance away. = Additional ignition = Engine 133 was set up on the east side of Tank No. 231 at Avenue “Y” at 4th Street, applying foam to the tank. Three members were attending to the apparatus and wading in the foam-water-petroleum mixture which was accumulating on the ground. Commissioner Rizzo and Gulf Refinery manager Jack Burk were on an overhead catwalk nearby observing the fire-fighting operation. Without warning, and in full view of Commissioner Rizzo and Burk, the accumulating liquid surrounding Engine 133 ignited, immediately trapping the three firefighters working at Engine 133. Without hesitation, other nearby firefighters dove into the burning liquid to rescue their comrades, not aware of the danger to themselves. Five more firefighters would be consumed by the advancing fire. = 7th to 9th alarms = It was now 4:41 p.m. and a firestorm was developing as the fire quickly spread eastward along Avenue “Y” towards 5th Street. Viewing the unfolding horror before him, Commissioner Rizzo ordered the seventh and eighth alarms, five additional rescue squads, and the recall of all companies which had previously been released from the firegrounds throughout the day. The burned firefighters were loaded into the Gulf Refinery Ambulance which roared past Rescue 7 - a mobile intensive care squad and the first apparatus to arrive on the scene after the liquid reignited. Firemedics in Rescue 7 took up a position behind an expressway pillar but found the position untenable due to the excessive heat from the fire. The apparatus was moved to the road East of the expressway and found the Gulf Fire chief on the ground suffering from a heart attack. As Rescue 7 treated the Gulf Fire chief the Administration building ignited from the heat and became fully involved in fire. At 4:46 p.m., Commissioner Rizzo ordered the ninth alarm and notification of Philadelphia Managing Director Hillel Levinson as a major disaster was now unfolding at the Gulf Refinery. As the fire swept eastward along 5th Street, Philadelphia's foam pumpers, Engines 160 and 133, and the Gulf Refinery foam pumper were destroyed in the fire's advance. At 5th Street, where Engines 16 and 40 had been assigned to improve drainage, their pieces were also destroyed in the fire's path, although their pump operators were able to escape. Upon reaching 5th Street, the fire traveled two city blocks north along 5th Street, threatening four additional storage tanks and the Penrose Avenue Bridge. = 10th alarm and unrelated 3-alarm fire = At 5:37 p.m., Commissioner Rizzo ordered the tenth alarm as the fire was then traveling southward and engulfing the refinery's administration building, which was located on the south side of Avenue “Y” between 4th and 5th Streets. The tenth alarm companies were ordered to report to Gate 24 at Penrose and Lanier Avenues, to set up deluge guns then remove themselves from the area. As the tenth alarm was being requested, the burden on the city's firefighting personnel was exacerbated by a box alarm transmitted for a fire in a paper warehouse away at “F” Street and Erie Avenue in North Philadelphia. Upon arrival, Chief Edward Hampson, Battalion Chief 10, had heavy fire in a three- story, former printing company now being used for paper storage. The second alarm was ordered at 6:07 p.m., followed by a special call for three additional engine companies at 7:18 p.m. Assistant Fire Chief James Skala, who had been at the New Jersey shore, returned to the City and assumed command of operations. = 11th alarm = As the situation continued to deteriorate at the Gulf Refinery, Commissioner Rizzo ordered all of the “D” platoon members from the day shift held over, and at 6:01 p.m., he ordered the 11th alarm. By seven o’clock, the involved tanks and pipelines were gushing flames and nearby streets in the complex were burning streams of oil and other petroleum products. For a period of time, it was far from certain where the fire would be stopped. Burk was quoted as saying that contingency plans had been made for a retreat through the refinery, street by street, tank by tank. But far from retreating, the men of the Philadelphia Fire Department attacked, retaking 5th Street, 4th Street, and finally Avenue Y. At 1:00 a.m. on Monday, August 18, 1975, Commissioner Rizzo left the firegrounds, going to area hospitals to visit the injured firefighters and to the homes of the families of the members who were unaccounted for. He relinquished command to Deputy Fire Commissioner Harry T. Kite. A second tank, 239, storing naphtha, was also involved in the fire. This tank was located on 4th Street just north of Avenue “Y.” On Monday morning, naphtha was pouring out of a pipe in that tank and igniting in mid- air. The naphtha was burning in the street in an ever-widening pool. To curtail this fire, it was determined that the valve, hidden behind an earthen levee at the rear of the tank, about from the burning naphtha, needed to be closed. Three Gulf employees volunteered to attempt to close the valve. Using an aluminum boat, they waded through the material contained within the dike surrounding the tank. Firefighters placed a water curtain over them as they kept moving forward to reach the valve. They successfully reached the valve, spun it shut, and took the time to tighten it with a wrench. This operation took five minutes. = Under control and (later) Fire out = Just minutes short of a full 24 hours after the fire started, Deputy Commissioner Kite declared the fire under control (but still burning) at 5:38 a.m. on Monday, August 18, 1975. A decision was made to allow the fire in the original tank, Tank 231, to burn itself out, and the fire was not declared extinguished until Tuesday, August 26, 1975. However, in the intervening week, box alarms were transmitted for “flare-ups” on four occasions to assist the fireground details that continued to work on the fire.  Casualties  By the morning of Monday, August 18, 1975, the cost to PFD personnel was confirmed. Six firefighters were killed and two were severely burned - and would die in the next few days - from the flare-up that occurred on Sunday afternoon. Fourteen other firefighters were burned and/or injured in their attempts to rescue the men caught in the flare-up. The six firefighters killed onsite were: * Firefighter John Andrews, Age 49, Engine 49 * Firefighter Joseph Wiley, Age 33, Ladder 27 * Firefighter Roger Parker, Age 28, Ladder 27 * Firefighter Hugh McIntyre, Age 53, Engine 56 * Firefighter Robert Fisher, Age 43, Engine 33 * Firefighter Ralph Campana, Age 41, Ladder 19 The two firefighters rescued, but fatally injured, were: * Fire Lieutenant James Pouliot, Age 35, Engine 20, died of his burns on August 24, 1975 * Firefighter Carroll Brenek, Age 33, Engine 57, died of his burns on August 30, 1975.  Cause of fire  The original cause of the fire was the overfilling of Tank 231. While no crude oil escaped from the tank as a result of being overfilled, large quantities of hydrocarbon vapors were trapped above the surface of the tank's crude oil. As the quantity of crude oil increased, these hydrocarbon vapors were forced out of the tank's vents and into the area of the No. 4 Boiler House where the initial flash occurred. The overfilling of the tank, in turn, resulted from a failure of the tanker's personnel to properly monitor the quantity of crude oil being pumped to the tank. At approximately 6:02 a.m. in the wake of the first explosions and fire, the tanker terminated its pumping operations, left its Schuylkill River berth and relocated downstream to the Gulf piers at Hog Island, near the junction of the Schuylkill with the Delaware River.  October 1975 9-alarm fire  Two months after the disaster, another 9 alarm fire broke out at the nearby ARCO refinery. On site this time, in addition to Fire Commissioner Rizzo, was Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo, the commissioner's brother. As with the August fire, the October fire was eventually deemed under control when a sudden flare up sent many of the firefighters and media scrambling for cover. Mayor Rizzo was knocked over by his bodyguard and suffered a severely broken right femur, which required surgery.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat;=19751012&id;=qTAcAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=rlkEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6539,5242353&hl;=en  Aftermath  In July 1977, Gulf was fined $37,000 ($ today) on charges covering more than 100 violations of the Philadelphia fire code. In August 2007, about 200 people gathered at the Fireman's Hall Museum in Philadelphia as International Association of Fire Fighters President Harold Shaitberger unveiled individual plaques honoring the firefighters lost in the refinery disaster. In 1982, following the merger of Gulf Oil and Chevron Corporation, the Gulf Girard Point refinery became the Chevron USA Philadelphia refinery. In 1994, Sunoco purchased the refinery from Chevron, merging it with the adjoining Point Breeze refinery complex (which Sunoco purchased in 1988) into a single operation--the largest on the U.S. Eastern seaboard. In 2012, Sunoco and investment firm The Carlyle Group formed the Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES) partnership, to own and operate the refinery complex, renamed PES Philadelphia Refining Complex.

He is best remembered for his 1965 hit single \\"Strain on My Heart\\" and for his working relationships with the Fairfield Four and with Bobby Hebb. Other notable recordings include \\"Think It Over\\" and \\"Baby Look What You're Doin' to Me\\". Fred James, who produced much of Shelton's later work, noted that Shelton moved effortlessly into soul music, unlike many of his 1950s blues and R&B; recording contemporaries. Biography Shelton was born in Lynchburg, Tennessee, and raised in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1949 he joined the Fairfield Four, singing lead vocals on their gospel music recordings. He then spent four years as a draftee in the United States Air Force. Upon discharge he joined the Skylarks in 1956 and recorded for Excello's subsidiary label Nashboro Records. After the group disbanded, Shelton sang alongside and toured with both Bobby Hebb and DeFord Bailey, Jr. In 1961 Shelton's debut album, Roscoe Shelton Sings, was released by Excello, and various singles followed, including \\"Strain on My Heart\\" (1965). The track was a Top 40 success on the Billboard R&B; chart. By this time Shelton's recordings were released by Sound Stage 7, including another Top 40 hit, \\"Easy Going Fellow.\\" His next album, Soul in His Music, Music in His Soul, was released in 1966, but the long gap between albums stalled his career. However, Shelton performed on the same bill as Otis Redding at the Apollo Theater. The deaths of Redding and Sam Cooke, who had been friends of Shelton's, took their toll on him. Shelton left the music industry in 1969 and went to work for the Meharry Medical College, in Nashville. In 1994 Shelton, Earl Gaines, and Clifford Curry found work billed as the Excello Legends. In 1995, Shelton's song \\"You Were the Dream\\" was used in the soundtrack of the film Blue Juice. Shelton resumed recording with the producer Fred James, releasing, amongst others, the album Let It Shine in 1998, and Shelton's and Gaines's joint effort Let's Work Together. Shelton died of cancer in Nashville, in July 2002, at the age of 70. Two years after his death, Shelton's \\"Say You Really Care\\" was included on the Grammy Award–winning compilation album Night Train to Nashville.

In 1860, Undine purchased Keystone Barge Club's (the 1st) boat and equipment, as Keystone had disposed of its boathouse.

Nobody is immune to her sharp tongue. But if she works her singers hard, she works herself harder: virtually all her spare time is spent searching for material, planning programmes, planning stage placements and movements, keeping up with choral techniques and new music (not least by attending events like the American Choral Conductors’ Convention), making her own musical arrangements, rehearsing soloists ... But the fact that audiences come back year after year shows that the Marionettes have hit a good balance between challenge and entertainment. This sensitive balance is vital if the choir is to keep audiences pleased and entertained without compromising musical integrity. It’s the same with the singers ... The choir itself has progressed too over the years, not just in musical professionalism and sophistication: it has become less austere and defensive about its music, it is projecting better, it has freed up.\\"\\"Chorale Caribbean\\" by Rosa Hill, Caribbean Beat, July/August 1999 (issue 38) Taylor has led the choir on several international tours,\\"Trinidad chorus brings island music to mainland, mainstream audience\\" by David Schonfeld, The Daily Collegian (Penn State University), 19 September 1997 which have included competing in major international choral festivals and performing in locations like St. Martin-in-the-Fields (London) and Carnegie Hall (New York).\\"Calling All Dawns\\", Distinguished Concerts International.

It replaced and updated the law previously known as the Acquired Rights Directive 77/187/EC.Council Directive 77/187/EEC of 14 February 1977 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses Overview The Directive stipulates that any employee's contract of employment will be transferred automatically on the same terms as before in the event of a transfer of the undertaking. This means that if an employer changes control of the business, the new employer cannot reduce the employees' terms and conditions, unless the Directive's exception criteria are met. This is that there must be a good economic, technical or organisational reason for the change. ;Chapter I – Scope and definitionsSummaries of EU legislation > Employment and social policy > Employment rights and work organisation > Summary of Directive 2001/23/EC Article 1 This says the directive applies to legal transfers and mergers of an undertaking. The point to note is that it excludes transfers of company control through a simple purchase of shares, which is the most common way to effect a change in the market for corporate control. Article 2 This gives definitions of transferor, transferee and the like. ;Chapter II – Safeguarding of employees' rights Article 3 This states the principle that the transferee is bound to the contractual and employment law obligations of the transferor. The transferor has to state what these are beforehand. Article 4 This provides the idea that dismissals should not take place just because there is a transfer. But dismissals can be made for 'any economic, technical and organisational reason'. Article 5 Member states can derogate from Art. 3 and 4 where the company is insolvent. Article 6 This states that employee representatives positions should not change where the undertaking retains autonomy through the transfer. It is talking mainly about unions. ;Chapter III – Information and consultation Article 7 This provides that employers thinking of transfers must consult with the workforce beforehand, through employee representatives. ;Chapter IV – Final provisions Article 8-14 These articles are addressed to the Member States, and talk about implementation maps, and notifications to the Commission of opinions or changes.

Most previous chemotherapy drugs for cancer were (relatively) nonselective in their activity. Although their exact mechanisms of action were varied and complex, they generally worked by damaging cells undergoing mitosis, which is usually more common in malignant tumors than in most normal tissues. Targeted agents are designed to be selective in their effects by modulating the activity of proteins necessary and essential for oncogenesis and maintenance of cancer, particularly enzymes driving the uncontrolled growth, angiogenesis, invasiveness, and metastasis characteristic of malignant tumors. The increased differential activity usually results in fewer troubling side effects for cancer patients, particularly less nausea, vomiting, and death of cells in the bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract, and increased effectiveness against tumor cells. Traditional lung cancer classification and treatment Lung cancer is an extremely heterogeneous family of malignant neoplasms, with well over 50 different histological variants recognized under the 4th revision of the World Health Organization (WHO) typing system, currently the most widely used lung cancer classification scheme.Travis WD, Brambilla E, Muller-Hermelink HK, Harris CC (Eds.): World Health Organization Classification of Tumours. Pathology and Genetics of Tumours of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus and Heart. IARC Press: Lyon 2004. Because these variants have differing genetic, biological, and clinical properties, including response to treatment, correct classification of lung cancer cases are necessary to assure that lung cancer patients receive optimum management.Rossi G, Marchioni A, Sartori1 G, Longo L, Piccinini S, Cavazza A. Histotype in non-small cell lung cancer therapy and staging: The emerging role of an old and underrated factor. Curr Resp Med Rev 2007; 3: 69-77. Approximately 98% of lung cancers are carcinoma, a term describing malignancies derived from transformed cells exhibiting characteristics of epithelium. About 2% of all lung cancers are non-carcinoma (mainly sarcoma, tumors of hematopoietic origin, or germ cell tumors. These forms of lung cancer are usually treated differently from carcinomas. Because of the ubiquity of lung carcinomas, however, the term \\"lung cancer\\" generally refers to carcinomas in everyday clinical practice. Despite the large number of histological variants of lung carcinoma, oncologists have long tended to favor a dichotomous division into small cell and non-small cell forms, based on differences in clinical behavior and response to treatment. Most small cell lung carcinomas (SCLC's) metastasize to distant organs early on in their course, rendering surgery ineffective in curing the cancer. In contrast, non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC's) are more likely to remain localized to the thorax during development, and are thus more amenable to cure using radical surgical resection. Additionally, SCLC's are typically much more sensitive to chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy than are NSCLC's. Therefore, current traditional treatment guidelines and standards of care recommend, when possible, the use of surgery for NSCLC, and chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy for SCLC. Agents in current use While a very large number of agents targeting various molecular pathways are being developed and tested, the main classes and agents that are now being used in lung cancer treatment include: *Inhibitors of Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI's): *erlotinib (Tarceva) *gefitinib (Iressa) *osimertinib (Tagrisso) monoclonal antibody against EGFR: * cetuximab (Erbitux) *Inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) bevacizumab (Avastin)http://www.avastin.com/avastin/patient/index.m * Inhibitor of EML4-ALK  crizotinib shows benefit in a subset of non-small cell lung cancer that is characterized by the EML4-ALK fusion oncogene, found in some relatively young, never or light smokers with adenocarcinoma. Non-small cell lung cancer Targeted agents are beginning to permit the design of more rational treatment regimens for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which comprises about 80% to 85% of all lung cancers. While there have been no randomized clinical trials of targeted agents in combined small-cell lung carcinoma (c-SCLC), some small case series suggest that some may be useful in c-SCLC. Many targeted agents appear more active in certain NSCLC variants. Given that c-SCLC contains components of NSCLC, and that the chemoradioresistance of NSCLC components impact the effectiveness of c-SCLC treatment, these agents may permit the design of more rational treatment regimens for c-SCLC. EGFR-TKI's have been found to be active against variants exhibiting certain mutations in the EGFR gene. While EGFR mutations are very rare (<5%) in \\"pure\\" SCLC, they are considerably more common (about 15–20%) in c-SCLC, particularly in non-smoking females whose c-SCLC tumors contain an adenocarcinoma component. These patients are much more likely to have classical EGFR mutations in the small cell component of their tumors as well, and their tumors seem to be more likely to respond to treatment with EGFR- TKI's. EGFR-targeted agents appear particularly effective in papillary adenocarcinoma, non-mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma with mixed subtypes. Bevacizumab may improve some measures of survival in both SCLC and non-squamous cell variants of NSCLC. Pemetrexed, although not classified as a targeted agent, has been shown to have improve survival in non-squamous cell NSCLC, and is the first drug to reveal differential survival benefit in large cell lung carcinoma. C-SCLC appear to express female hormone (i.e. estrogen and/or progesterone) receptors in a high (50%-67%) proportion of cases, similar to breast carcinomas However, it is at present unknown whether blockade of these receptors affects the growth of c-SCLC. Several studies have shown that EGFR-TKI's are particularly active in papillary and non-mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma variants of adenocarcinoma. Bevacizumab is contraindicated in squamous cell carcinoma and its variants. Pemetrexed has been approved for treating non-squamous lung carcinomas, and is the first drug that has been specifically shown to improve survival in large cell carcinoma. Small-cell lung cancer To date, most clinical trials of newer targeted agents - both alone and in combination with previously tested treatment regimens - have either been less effective, or no more effective, than older platinum-based doublets in SCLC. Combined small-cell lung cancer The term \\"combined small-cell lung carcinoma\\" (c-SCLC) refers to a multiphasic lung cancer that contains a component of SCLC admixed with one (or more) components of NSCLC. It is currently considered a variant of SCLC under the current World Health Organization lung tumor classification scheme. While the true incidence of c-SCLC is unknown, case series suggest that they may account for as many as 25% to 30% of all cases of SCLC, and for 4% to 6% of all lung cancer cases. Traditionally, c-SCLC have been treated according to guidelines established for \\"pure\\" SCLC. To date, most clinical trials of targeted agents, alone and in combination with previously tested treatment regimens, have either been ineffective in SCLC or no more effective than standard platinum-based doublets. While there have been no randomized clinical trials of targeted agents in c-SCLC, some small case series suggest that some agents currently in use may be beneficial in c-SCLC. Many targeted agents appear more active in certain NSCLC variants. Given that c-SCLC contains components of NSCLC, and that the chemoradioresistance of NSCLC components impact the effectiveness of c-SCLC treatment, these agents may permit the design of more rational treatment regimens for c-SCLC.

Born in Pittsburgh, he attended the Universities of Pittsburgh and Michigan and lived in South America collecting mammals. In 1947, he was appointed a curator at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago and he continued to work there until his death. He has published much on the mammals of the Neotropics, particularly primates and rodents, and described almost 70 new species and subspecies of mammals. About a dozen species have been named after him. Life =Early life= Philip Hershkovitz was born 12 October 1909 in Pittsburgh to parents Aba and Bertha (Halpern) Hershkovitz. He was the second child and only son among four siblings. He reported that his father died when he was nine years old. After graduating from Schenley High School in 1927, he attended the University of Pittsburgh from 1929 to 1931, majoring in zoology, before transferring to the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, which had more course offerings in zoology. He was an assistant in the zoology department and did taxidermical work. In 1932, he went to Texas to collect Typhlomolge rathbuni cave salamanders. He wanted to also trap small mammals, which he found more interesting, but had no traps to do that. On a chance visit to the Field Museum of Natural History (FMNH) in Chicago, he befriended the Curator of Mammals there, Colin Campbell Sanborn, who loaned him the supplies he needed. This event was the beginning of Hershkovitz's long relationship with the FMNH. As the Great Depression worsened, Hershkovitz was no longer able to afford life in Michigan, and in 1933 he decided to move to Ecuador, which he was told was one of the cheapest countries in the Americas to live in. He collected a number of mammal specimens and learned to speak Spanish, supporting himself in part by trading in horses. He returned in 1937 and again enrolled at Ann Arbor, graduating in 1938. Subsequently, he became a graduate student there and got his MSc degree in 1940. He then entered the doctoral program, but in 1941 he was awarded a Walter Rathbone Bacon Traveling Scholarship by the United States National Museum in Washington, D.C., to work in the Santa Marta area of northern Colombia, where he stayed till 1943. Hershkovitz enlisted in the U.S. Armed Services during World War II and served the Office of Strategic Services in Europe. In 1945, he married Anne Marie Pierrette Dode, whom he had met in France, and the same year he returned to America to continue his Bacon Scholarship studies in Washington, D.C., where his first child of three—Francine, Michael, and Mark—was born in 1946. =Curator at the Field Museum= In 1947, Hershkovitz was offered a position as Assistant Curator of Mammals at the FMNH and accepted, although it meant that he was unable to complete his doctoral studies. He immediately went back to the field and stayed in Colombia until his curatorial duties called him back to Chicago in 1952. His Colombian collections remained at the center of his research interests afterward, as he entirely revised many taxa of which he had found representatives in Colombia. He had a good relationship with Chief Curator of the Department of Zoology Karl P. Schmidt and actively took care of his curatorial duties (appointed Associate Curator in 1954 and full Curator in 1956). Schmidt retired in 1957 and his successor, Austin P. Rand, enjoyed a less positive relation with Hershkovitz, and the latter detached himself from the Museum's day-to-day affairs. Ultimately, in 1962, Hershkovitz was replaced as Curator of Mammals by Joseph Moore and took the unprecedented title of Research Curator. He worked in the field in Surinam in 1960–61 and in Bolivia in 1965–66. =Retirement and death= 1987 Fieldiana Zoology, No: 39 (festschrift) Hershkovitz retired in 1974, but continued his research unabated as Curator Emeritus, and in 1980–81 he worked in the field in Peru. In 1987, a festschrift was published for him under the title Studies in Neotropical Mammalogy: Essays in Honor of Philip Hershkovitz, an honor that had been given to only three previous Field Museum scientists. It included papers on some of the fields Hershkovitz had worked in, a biography and bibliography of him by Bruce Patterson, and a review, written by Hershkovitz himself, of the historical development of mammalogy in the Neotropics. By 1987, he was still tireless, spending long days in the museum without even pausing for lunch. He worked in Brazil on several occasions, the last in 1992, after which his health prevented him from going. He died from complications resulting from bone cancer at the Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago on 15 February 1997, at the age of 87; he continued to work on his mammalogical research until two weeks before his death. He was survived by two sons, a son-in-law, and two grandchildren. Research Hershkovitz published extensively on the biology of each of the twelve orders of Neotropical mammals, focusing generally on taxonomy and biogeography. He wrote 164 papers, including both broad monographs and smaller contributions, and described 67 new species and subspecies and 13 new genera. He was an independent researcher, writing most of his contributions alone; only three he co-authored with other scientists. He participated in some fiery scientific debates, with views that according to Patterson's biographical note \\"brand him as something other than conciliatory or diplomatic\\". In 1968, he published his theory of metachromism, which attempts to explain variation in fur coloration among mammals through the loss of one of two classes of pigments in the hairs. Hershkovitz may have been most well known for his studies of primates, to the extent that many thought him a primatologist, but he was quick to point out that, as Patterson phrases it, \\"nothing could be further from the truth\\". He had published on primates earlier, but did not give them special attention until the 1960s, when grant opportunities persuaded him to begin studying them, first Callitrichidae and later Cebidae. In 1977, he published a review of callitrichids that according to Ronald H. Pine was \\"the most heroically monumental revisionary monograph ever devoted to a Neotropical group\\"; it was to be the first volume of a comprehensive treatment of living New World monkeys. He continued with smaller-scale papers on cebids and assembled notes to continue his series on living New World monkeys, but eventually financial support ceased and Hershkovitz was relieved to be able to spend the last decade of his life studying the mammals that most \\"intrigued and animated\\" him—rodents and marsupials. One of Hershkovitz's first papers was on rodents, describing two new Ecuadorean squirrels in 1938, and he continued to publish about the group, including reviews of Nectomys, Oecomys, Phyllotini, Holochilus, and scapteromyines between 1944 and 1966. He played an important role in formalizing and defining the tribal groups within the sigmodontine rodents of South America. However, his contributions at the time have been cited as examples of \\"vague notions of clade recognition\\", \\"phylogenetic transcendentalism\\" unsubstantiated by data, and \\"[misleading simplification] of a complex reality\\". He was engaged in discussions on the significance of penis morphology in sigmodontines and on their origin. Over eighty years old, he resumed studies of rodents in Brazil and discovered many additional new species. Shortly after his death, head of the FMNH's mammal division Lawrence Heaney said \\"The information he gathered was the basis for much of the conservation planning that's being done now in most of the major habitats in South America.\\" In 1966, he published a Catalog of Living Whales; he had originally intended to review the whales living off the South American coast, but expanded the project to all the world's species. This Catalog remains an invaluable resource for any student of cetaceans who needs to know the meaning of some obscure old name and has been called \\"a taxonomic Rosetta Stone\\". Although Hershkovitz was not a marine mammalogist, a brief obituary on him appeared in Marine Mammals Science in 1998. He treated many other mammals in his publications, including reviews of marsupials such as Gracilinanus, Philander, and Dromiciops, the tapirs of the Americas, some of the cottontail rabbits of South America, and also published extensively on nomenclature. Honors Hershkovitz was made a corresponding member of The Explorers Club in 1977. In 1988, he was the Honorary President of the XIIth Congress of the International Primatological Society. In 1991, the American Society of Primatologists named him a Distinguished Primatologist and the American Society of Mammalogists awarded him Honorary Membership.

A path from the car park in North Malvern follows the lower contour of North Hill to Happy Valley and St. Ann's Well.  History  Although the flint route from North Wales to Wessex lay to the north of Malvern, there is some evidence to suggest that traders passed over the Malvern Hills. Parts of an arrowhead, scraper and flint flakes have been discovered between the North Hill and Table Hill. A 19th-century guide book describes both a collapsed burial mound on North Hill named the Giant's Grave and a tump on Table Hill.

It was one of the few grounds in the Czech Republic that permanently hosted amusement attractions like roller coaster and ferris wheel, however, since 2018, those two permanent attractions were removed and are present only during the funfairs seasons. The park host funfairs in spring and autumn seasons.  Fairs  St. Matthew's Fair (Matějská pouť) is usually held from end of February to April and Wenceslas Autumn Fair (Václavská podzimní pouť) from September to October.St Matthew's Fair The Matthew's fair is the most popular and biggest funfair in Czech Republic and host attractions like the Hammer Booster which is 60 meters high and is the highest in Europe and other around 130 attractions. Amusement park is closed from the beginning of November to the end of February.  History  St. Matthew's Fair (Matějská pouť) has very old tradition, which dates back to 1595, originally as the pilgrimage of Saint Matthew to the Church of St. Matthew in Dejvice (history of the church dates to the 10th century). Since then, the tradition of the Matthew's pilgrimages has been developed. The pilgrimage route started near the current Hradčanská metro station of Prague and led to the Chapel of St. John of Nepomuk, where a parish fair took place. The parish fair gradually moved to the lower sections of the pilgrimage, especially to today's Victory Square (Vítězné náměstí) in Dejvice. During the First Czechoslovak Republic, approximately a quarter of a million people participated in this pilgrimage. However, the development of Dejvice forced this fair to move from this place in the 1960s. After several places (Letná, Modřany, Břevnov) the fair permanently moved to Výstaviště Praha in Bubeneč (nearby Dejvice). Secularization of Czech society caused the religious origins of the fairs to be largely forgotten. In the 1990s, the number of St. Matthew's Fair visitors approached one million. The fairground is now run by the Incheba company, the fair by Kočka company, both owned by Kočka family.

He was the founder of the hedge fund Scion Capital, which he ran from 2000 until 2008, before closing the firm to focus on his own personal investments. Burry was the first investor to recognize and profit from the impending subprime mortgage crisis. Early life and education Michael Burry was born in 1971 and grew up in San Jose, California. At the age of two he lost one of his eyes to cancer and has had an artificial eye ever since. As a teenager, Burry attended Santa Teresa High School. Burry studied economics and pre-med at the University of California, Los Angeles, went on to earn an M.D. from the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, and started but did not finish his residency in neurology at Stanford University Medical Center. While off duty at night, Burry worked on his hobby, financial investing. Despite not practicing, Burry has kept his license as a physician active with the Medical Board of California, including continuing education requirements.https://search.dca.ca.gov/results Users need to fill in name of physician\\"These Doctors Mean Business,\\" Whitney, Kathy, Medicine (Vanderbilt School of Medicine), Summer 2014 Investment career After medical school, Burry worked as a Stanford Hospital neurology resident and then a Stanford Hospital pathology resident. Burry then left to start his own hedge fund. He had already developed a reputation as an investor by demonstrating success in value investing, which he wrote about on message boards on the stock discussion site Silicon Investor beginning in 1996. He was so successful with his stock picks that he attracted the interest of companies such as Vanguard, White Mountains Insurance Group and prominent investors such as Joel Greenblatt. Burry has a strictly traditional understanding of value. He has said more than once that his investment style is built upon Benjamin Graham and David Dodd’s 1934 book Security Analysis: \\"All my stock picking is 100% based on the concept of a margin of safety.\\" After shutting down his website in November 2000, Burry started the (now defunct) hedge fund Scion Capital, funded by an inheritance and loans from his family. The company was named after Terry Brooks' The Scions of Shannara (1990), one of his favorite novels. Burry quickly earned extraordinary profits for his investors. According to the author Michael Lewis, \\"in his first full year, 2001, the S&P; 500 fell 11.88%. Scion was up 55%. Burry was able to achieve these returns by shorting overvalued tech stocks at the peak of the internet bubble. The next year, the S&P; 500 fell again, by 22.1%, and yet Scion was up again: 16%. The next year, 2003, the stock market finally turned around and rose 28.69%, but Mike Burry beat it again—his investments rose by 50%. By the end of 2004, Mike Burry was managing $600 million and turning money away.\\" In 2005, Burry started to focus on the subprime market. Through his analysis of mortgage lending practices in 2003 and 2004, he correctly predicted that the real estate bubble would collapse as early as 2007. Burry's research on the values of residential real estate convinced him that subprime mortgages, especially those with \\"teaser\\" rates, and the bonds based on these mortgages, would begin losing value when the original rates were replaced by much higher rates, often in as little as two years after initiation. This conclusion led Burry to short the market by persuading Goldman Sachs and other investment firms to sell him credit default swaps against subprime deals he saw as vulnerable. This analysis proved correct, and Burry profited accordingly. During his payments toward the credit default swaps, Burry suffered an investor revolt, where some investors in his fund worried his predictions were inaccurate and demanded to withdraw their capital. Eventually, Burry's analysis proved correct; he earned a personal profit of $100 million and a profit for his remaining investors of more than $700 million. Scion Capital ultimately recorded returns of 489.34% (net of fees and expenses) between its November 1, 2000 inception and June 2008. The S&P; 500, widely regarded as the benchmark for the US market, returned just under 3%, including dividends over the same period. According to his website, Burry liquidated his credit default swap short positions by April 2008 and did not benefit from the bailouts of 2008 and 2009. He subsequently liquidated his company to focus on his personal investment portfolio.Scion Capital website, accessed March 30, 2010. In an April 3, 2010 op-ed for The New York Times, Burry argued that anyone who studied the financial markets carefully in 2003, 2004, and 2005 could have recognized the growing risk in the subprime markets. He faulted federal regulators for failing to listen to warnings from outside a closed circle of advisors. In 2013, Burry reopened his hedge fund, this time called Scion Asset Management, filing reports as an exempt reporting adviser (ERA) who is active in the state of California and approved by the SEC. Burry has focused much of his attention on investing in water, gold, and farm land. Burry has been quoted saying \\"Fresh, clean water cannot be taken for granted. And it is not—water is political, and litigious.\\" After the end of the film, The Big Short, a statement regarding Burry's current interest reads, \\"The small investing he still does is all focused on one commodity: water.\\" Glimpses were offered into Scion's portfolio with 13Fs filed from the 4th quarter of 2015 through the 3rd quarter of 2016, as required by the SEC when fund holdings top $100 million. After more than two years, on February 14, 2019, Scion Asset Management filed another 13F, showing Michael Burry to hold numerous large-cap stocks and $103,528,000 13F assets under management, just above the threshold for filing. In August, 2019, Bloomberg News quoted an email from Burry stating his belief that there was a bubble in large US company stocks due to the popularity of passive investing, which \\"has orphaned smaller value-type securities globally\\".Heejin Kim and Myungshin Cho (29 August 2019). The Big Short’s Michael Burry Sees a Bubble in Passive Investing Bloomberg News, accessed 29 Aug 2019 The biggest investments are Alphabet (121 million value) and Facebook (24.4 million value) from Burry in 2020.

Bill Leyden was the host, and Wendell Niles was the announcer. Details It Could Be You used a variation of the format made famous in another popular show of the time, Queen for a Day, where a woman who had gone through many hardships in her life was selected and awarded prizes. However, It Could Be You, though still awarding prizes, focused most often on a woman's more embarrassing moments -- for example: being seen by a neighbor while getting out of a bathtub, or engaging in a romantic interlude with a boyfriend while parked next to a bus full of tourists. Sometimes, the contestant had to perform a stunt or activity to claim the prize. The title of the series was part of the show, in that the woman called to the stage was from a studio audience which had been told ... \\"It Could Be You\\".Brooks, Tim and March, Earl (2007) \\"The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows: 1946-Present\\", Random House, p. page 507 Prizes were often more humorous than useful -- a woman who complained about moving from city to city so much that she could never get used to her new bathtub received a bathtub on wheels.

The show was produced from Studio D of NBC Radio City in Hollywood and later from Studio 1 of the NBC Studios in Burbank, California.

Through the War Measures Act, the government of Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King gave itself the power to suspend habeas corpus, revoke rights, seize property and arrest those who were deemed a threat to the safety of Canada—labeling 31,000 Italian Canadians as \\"enemy aliens\\". Between 1940 and 1943, between 600 and 700 Italian Canadian men were arrested and sent to internment camps as potentially dangerous enemy aliens with alleged fascist connections. While many Italian Canadians had initially supported fascism and Benito Mussolini's regime for its role in enhancing Italy's presence on the world stage, most Italians in Canada did not harbour any ill will against Canada and few remained committed followers of the fascist ideology. No Italian Canadians were ever charged with criminal activity as a result of the internment. Enemy aliens On June 10, 1940, all fascist organizations in Canada were deemed illegal. They included the Casa D'Italia consulate on Beverley Street, the fascist newspaper Il Bolletino and the Dopolavoro (after work) social club. Casa D'Italia was seized by the Custodian of Enemy Alien Property and sold to the RCMP. Newspaper accounts of the day, such as the Ottawa Citizen, tell that the status of \\"enemy alien\\" was immediately placed on non-resident Italians older than 16 years of age, and on Italian Canadians who became British subjects after September 1929. The category later expanded to include nationals of belligerent states naturalized after 1922. Those affected by the War Measures Act and Defense of Canada Regulations (DOCR) were forced to register with the RCMP and report to them on a monthly basis. Most of the Italian Canadian men were interned at Camp Petawawa (Camp 33), as well as camps in Minto, New Brunswick and Kananaskis, Alberta, for several years. A notable internee was Hamilton, Ontario's notorious bootlegger Rocco Perri. Legacy In 1990, former prime minister Brian Mulroney apologized for the war internment to a Toronto meeting of the National Congress of Italian Canadians: \\"On behalf of the government and the people of Canada, I offer a full and unqualified apology for the wrongs done to our fellow Canadians of Italian origin during World War II.\\" In May 2009, Massimo Pacetti introduced bill C-302, an \\"Act to recognize the injustice that was done to persons of Italian origin through their \\"enemy alien\\" designation and internment during the Second World War, and to provide for restitution and promote education on Italian Canadian history [worth $2.5 million]\\", which was passed by the House of Commons on April 28, 2010.Third Session, Fortieth Parliament, House of Commons, Bill C–302 Retrieved January 2, 2011. (pdf file) Canada Post was also to issue a commemorative postage stamp commemorating the internment of Italian Canadian citizens, however, Bill C-302 did not pass through the necessary stages to become law. In 2013, as a part of the permanent exhibition Italian Canadians as Enemy Aliens: Memories of World War II at the Columbus Centre in Toronto, funded by Villa Charities Inc and Citizenship and Immigration Canada, artist Harley Valentine created a monument recognizing the internments called \\"Riflessi: Italian Canadian Internment Memorial\\". The main statue is composed of several profiles—a (grand)father, internee, pregnant mother, and child—that combine to form a single figure in mirror polished stainless steel. In September 2018, the RCMP planted a tree on the grounds of the Canadian Police College in Ottawa as a show of regret for their involvement with the internment of Italian Canadians.

Life The Earldom of Tankerville lost its lands when France was lost to the English crown in 1453. It does not appear \\"that this nobleman was ever summoned to parliament but strong evidence exists that he sat in assembly as a baron of the realm in 1455\\",Bernard Burke, A genealogical history of the dormant, abeyant, forfeited, and extinct peerages of the British Empire, London, 1866, p. 251 when it is recorded that he swore allegiance to Henry VI as Sir Richard Grey, Lord of Powis. In the Wars of the Roses he was with the Duke of York at the Battle of Ludford Bridge on 12 October 1459. His support for the house of York resulted in his being attainted with many others by the Lancastrian Henry VI in 1460, when the earl of Warwick ordered him to surrender Montgomery castle. All his hereditary titles were abolished by this attainder, bringing an end to this creation of the Earldom of Tankerville. The attainder would also have abolished the title of Baron of Powis.Bernard Burke, A genealogical history of the dormant, abeyant, forfeited, and extinct peerages of the British Empire, London, 1866, p. 251 Henry VI reversed the attainder once he had control of the lands, and had received a promise of loyalty. In 1461 when Yorkist Edward IV came to the throne Richard Grey received the stewardship of Kerry, Kedwen, and Montgomery. Continuing his Yorkist support, Richard Grey was with Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, at the siege of Alnwick Castle in November 1462 to take it back, after the Lancastrians had taken it by siege from the captaincy of his cousin Sir Ralph Grey of Heton. Sir Richard Grey, Lord Grey of Powis, died 17 December 1466. His widow, Margaret, married (2nd) (as his 2nd wife) Roger Vaughan, Knt. Sir Roger Vaughan was executed at Chepstow in 1471.

It is usually seen as one of two liabilities established in Barnes v Addy, the other one being knowing receipt. To be liable for dishonest assistance, there must be a breach of trust or fiduciary duty by someone other than the defendant, the defendant must have helped that person in the breach, and the defendant must have a dishonest state of mind. The liability itself is well established, but the mental element of dishonesty is subject to considerable controversy which sprang from the House of Lords case Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley.[2002] UKHL 12 History It is a common belief that dishonest or knowing assistance originates from Lord Selbourne's judgment in Barnes v Addy: As can be seen, the judgment laid down two heads of liability: one based on receipt of trust property (knowing receipt) and the other on assisting with knowledge in a dishonest and fraudulent design (knowing assistance). Lord Selbourne's statement has been heavily criticized, particularly on the requirement that the defaulting fiduciary / trustee has to be dishonest or fraudulent. A commentator noted that Fyler v Fyler and AG v The Corporation of Leicester, two decisions on knowing assistance in the 1840s which predated Barnes v Addy, did not mention the moral quality of the breach induced or assisted at all. Another debate was regarding the type of knowledge that would suffice to impose liability. Peter Gibson J in Baden v Société Générale identified 5 categories of knowledge which was subject to much debate and led the courts into \\"tortuous convolutions\\".Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan, per Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead Nature =Secondary= The prevalent view is that liability for dishonest assistance is secondary. Therefore, the liability of the assistant is premised on that of the defaulting fiduciary / trustee and he/she will be jointly and severally liable with the fiduciary / trustee whom he/she assisted. However, Charles Mitchell recognized possible difficulties with this categorization: firstly, secondary liability means that the dishonest assistant will be liable for the disgorgement gains of the defaulting fiduciary / trustee, while the fiduciary / trustee will not be liable for secret profits of the dishonest assistant; secondly, the assessment of exemplary damages against the dishonest assistant will be based on that of the fiduciary / trustee which can be undesirable.S Elliot and C Mitchell, 'Remedies for Dishonest Assistance' (2004) 67 MLR 16 There are also views that liability for dishonest assistance should be primary. However, such views have yet to receive judicial endorsement.P Ridge, 'Justifying the Remedies for Dishonest Assistance' (2008) 124 LQR 445-468 =Constructive trusteeship= Dishonest assistants have been frequently described by courts as constructive trustees. However, such classification is not without difficulty: dishonest assistance is often imposed even if there is no obviously identifiable property subject to the trust; also, in many cases of dishonest assistance property has reached the hands of innocent third parties who may not be under any obligation to restore it.AJ Oakley, Parker and Mellows: The Modern Law of Trusts (9th edn Sweet & Maxwell 2008) , 408-409 Some commentators have sought to explain this on the basis that there is a type of constructive trust which can arise even if there is no identifiable trust property.DJ Hayton, OR Marshall and JA Nathan Hayton & Marshall Commentary & Cases on the Law of Trusts and Equitable Remedies (9th edn 1991) , 440-441 However, the prevalent view is that dishonest assistance is a personal liability that does not result in an imposition of constructive trust. This view has the support of Lord Millett who remarked in Dubai Aluminium Co v Salaam:[2002] UKHL 48 Elements =Breach of trust= The trustee or fiduciary of the claimant must be liable for a breach of trust or fiduciary duty. It is sufficient if the trust in question is a resulting trustTwinsectra v Yardley [2002] UKHL 12 or constructive trust.Competitive Insurance Company v Davies Investments [1975] 1 WLR 1240 Previously, it was thought that the dishonest assistant would not be liable unless the defaulting trustee was also dishonest or fraudulent, but Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan confirmed that there is no such requirement in English law. However, the requirement of dishonest or fraudulent design on the part of the defaulting fiduciary / trustee is still part of the law in Australia.Consul Development v DPC Estates Pty Ltd [1975] HCA 8Farah Constructions Pty v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2004] NSWSC 800 Whether a breach of trust should be required at all has been queried by a commentator, since no breach is required for the analogous tort of interference with contractual relations and if the fiduciary reasonably relies on the probity and competence of the dishonest assistant, the claimant would be left with no remedy.S Gardner 'Knowing Assistance and Knowing Receipt: Taking Stock' (1996) 112 LQR 56,58 =Assistance by defendant= This element is a question of fact as to whether the defendant has been accessory to the misfeasance or breach of trust in question. =Dishonesty= The test In Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan, Royal Brunei Airlines appointed Borneo Leisure Travel (‘BLT’) to act in Sabah and Sarawak as its general travel agent. The arrangement constituted BLT a trustee for the airline of the money it received from the sale of passenger and cargo transportation. The money received by BLT on behalf of the airline was paid into BLT’s ordinary current account. Any balance in its current account in excess of a stated amount was transferred at times to a fixed deposit account of Mr. Tan, who was BLT's managing director and principal shareholder. BLT was required to pay the airline within 30 days, but at times from 1988 onwards, it was in arrears. In August 1992, the airline terminated the agreement and subsequently claimed against Mr. Tan in respect of the unpaid money. Historically in England, liability would be imposed on persons who assisted in a breach of trust or fiduciary duty \\"with knowledge\\".Barnes v Addy (1874) 9 Ch App 214 Hence its previous name of \\"knowing assistance\\". Knowledge is still the cornerstone of the liability in Australia and Canada.Gold v Rosenberg [1997] 3 SCR 767 The modern English terminology emerged in Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan[1995] 2 AC 378 in which the Privy Council rejected knowledge as an element of the liability and replaced it with a requirement for dishonesty. After opting for the imposition of fault-based liability, Lord Nicholls said, His Lordship went on to articulate a test for dishonesty, which is generally perceived to be an objective test with some subjective characteristics: Hence, the conduct of the defendant is to be assessed according to an objective standard of dishonesty in light of the actual knowledge of the defendant. When undertaking such exercise, the court will also have regard to personal attributes of the defendant, such as his experience and intelligence, and the reason why he acted as he did. His Lordship then gave a few examples of dishonesty, such as deception, knowingly taking the property of others, participation in a transaction in light of knowledge that it involves a misapplication of trust assets, willful blindness etc. The issue was later reconsidered in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley in the House of Lords, which unfortunately returned a different answer. The majority in that case held that Lord Nicholls in Royal Brunei meant to say that, for a person to be held liable as an accessory to a breach of trust, he had to have acted dishonestly by the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people and have been himself aware that by those standards he was acting dishonestly. This became known as the \\"combined test\\", namely a standard which requires both subjective and objective states of mind. Lord Hutton's reason for adopting the combined test is that a finding by a judge that a defendant has been dishonest is a grave finding, and it is particularly grave against a professional man. Therefore, in his view, a higher level of blameworthiness is required to impose liability in dishonest assistance. Lord Millett delivered a dissenting judgment, maintaining that Royal Brunei decided that the test of dishonesty is objective, although account must be taken of subjective considerations such as the defendant’s experience and intelligence and his actual state of knowledge at the relevant time. But it is not necessary that he should actually have appreciated that he was acting dishonestly; it is sufficient that he was. The question is whether an honest person would appreciate that what he was doing was wrong or improper, not whether the defendant himself actually appreciated this. His Lordship gave 3 reasons for this: #Consciousness of wrongdoing is an aspect of mens rea and an appropriate condition of criminal liability: it is not an appropriate condition of civil liability. #The objective test is in accordance with Barnes v Addy and the traditional doctrine. #The claim for “knowing assistance” is the equitable counterpart of the economic torts. These are intentional torts; negligence is not sufficient and dishonesty is not necessary. Liability depends on knowledge. A requirement of subjective dishonesty introduces an unnecessary and unjustified distinction between the elements of the equitable claim and those of the tort of wrongful interference with the performance of a contract. What Lord Hutton said in Twinsectra has now been reinterpreted and restated by the Privy Council in Barlow Clowes International v Eurotrust International.[2006] 1 WLR 1476 In that case, Lord Hoffmann reaffirmed the objective test, i.e. the one maintained by Lord Millett in Twinsectra, as the correct test for dishonesty. His Lordship interpreted Lord Hutton's reference to 'what he knows would offend normally acceptable standards of honest conduct' as meaning only that his knowledge of the transaction had to be such as to render his participation contrary to normally acceptable standards of honest conduct. His Lordship said that it is not necessary for the defendant to have reflections what those normally acceptable standards of honest conduct were. Subsequently, the lower English courts have adopted the test laid down in Barlow Clowes, although theoretically it is not open to them to refuse to follow the House of Lords decision in Twinsectra. In Abou-Rahmah v Abacha[2005] EWHC 2662; [2006] 1 All ER 247 before the English Court of Appeal, Arden LJ endorsed Barlow Clowes as representing the current English law for 4 reasons: #Barlow Clowes did not require a departure from Twinsectra, but merely give guidance as to the proper interpretation to be given to Twinsectra as a matter of English law. #Barlow Clowes drew no distinction between the law of Isle of Man and English law #Members of the Privy Council in Barlow Clowes were all members of the House of Lords, and included 2 members of the majority from Twinsectra. The House of Lords is unlikely to come to a different view as to the proper interpretation of Twinsectra. #There are no overriding reasons why in the context of civil liability (as opposed to criminal liability) the law should take account of the defendant’s subjective views of the morality of his actions. However, the other two judges, Pill LJ and Rix LJ, refused to get drawn into the controversy as it was unnecessary to decide on the proper test for dishonesty to dispose of the appeal. In fact, some commentators have suggested that Pill LJ seems to support the combined test in Twinsectra, although he did not make it explicit.K Nikunj, 'Dishonest Assistance: The Latest Perspective From the Court of Appeal' (2007) 22(6) Journal of Banking Law and Regulation 305-317 In AG of Zambia v Meer Care & Desai,[2007] EWHC 952 Peter Smith J at the Chancery Division opined that the question of objective/subjective test is an over elaboration and endorsed the test set out in Royal Brunei, which he regards as another way of posing the jury question \\"was the defendant dishonest\\". He disagreed with Lord Hutton's view in Twinsectra that Lord Millett was articulating a purely objective test. He also regarded Lord Hutton's justification for the combined test, that dishonesty is a grave finding against professionals, as erroneous since it is no less grave for a non professional to be accused of dishonesty and there had been plenty of dishonest professionals. The test in Royal Brunei and Barlow Clowes has been accepted as the law in New Zealand in the New Zealand Court of Appeal case US International Marketing Ltd v National Bank of NZ Ltd. However, one of the three judges (Tipping J) applied a reasonable person test as opposed to the honest person test in determining the question of dishonesty. What knowledge constitutes dishonesty In Agip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson[1992] 4 All ER 385 and Twinsectra v Yardley, Lord Millett remarked that it is not necessary that the dishonest assistant should be aware of the identity of the victim or nature of the breach and knowledge that the money is not at the free disposal of the assisted person suffices to impose liability. Similarly, in Barlow Clowes, Lord Hoffmann said it is unnecessary for the dishonest assistant to know of the existence of breach or the facts; it is enough if he /she knows or suspects he is assisting in misappropriation of money without knowing money is held on trust. What level of suspicion suffice to trigger the liability continues to trouble the courts. In Abou-Rahmah, Arden LJ opined that the dishonest assistant is not dishonest if he only has general suspicions about impropriety as opposed to particular suspicions regarding specific transactions. However, Rix LJ thought otherwise and said that general suspicion is enough to trigger the liability. Causation Relationship with knowing receipt Traditionally, dishonest assistance and knowing receipt are seen as two distinct heads of liability: one is fault based, while the other is receipt based. However, there has been academic discussion as to whether they can be grouped together. Charles Mitchell proposes that if we adopt Peter Birk’s view regarding knowing receipt (that knowing receipt can be based on unjust enrichment as well as fault), there is a strong case for treating liability for dishonest assistance and fault-based knowing receipt as aspects of a single equitable wrong of interfering with another’s equitable rights – a wrong he called “equitable conversion”. Furthermore, Lord Nicholls has proposed extrajudicially that dishonesty is one of the bases for the liability for knowing receipt and that dishonest receipt can be grouped with dishonest assistance into dishonest participation in breach of trust.

He was a prominent member of the civil rights movement in the German Democratic Republic and has continued to take part in politics after German reunification in 1990. Early years and professional career Born in Wittenberge on the river Elbe, Friedrich Schorlemmer grew up in the small town of Werben in the region of Altmark, just south of it. The son of a Protestant minister, Schorlemmer was not allowed by the East German authorities to take the exam sat a normal secondary state school, but he passed his at an adult education centre. As a pacifist, he refused to do military service. From 1962 to 1967 he studied theology at Martin-Luther University in Halle. Then, he was a supervisor of studies in a hall of residence and a curate in Halle West. After his ordination in 1970, he worked as a minister in charge of young people and especially students in Merseburg. In 1978, he became a lecturer at the Protestant Preachers' Seminary in Wittenberg and also a preacher at All Saints' Church (Schlosskirche, \\"Castle Church\\") there, which is closely associated with Martin Luther and his 95 Theses. Finally, from 1992 until his retirement in December 2007, he was Head of Studies at the Protestant Academy of Saxony-Anhalt in Wittenberg. Schorlemmer was a member of the Protestant synods of Saxony and of East Germany. Politics When, in 1968, Alexander Dubček tried to reform communism in Czechoslovakia in the Prague Spring, Schorlemmer and his friends not only sympathized with that development but also spread information about it.Friedrich Schorlemmer: Das Land ist still. Noch. Publik-Forum 21/2008, 7 November 2008, p. 65 In the 1970s and 1980s, he worked for environmental, human rights and peace groups. The department \\"Political Underground\\" of the State Security Service (Stasi) put him under observation. He was responsible for a symbolical act at the Protestant Church Congress (Kirchentag) in Wittenberg on 24 September 1983, in which a sword was turned into a ploughshare by Stefan Nau, a local blacksmith. The State Security Service did not interfere because the future West German President Richard von Weizsäcker, who was then Mayor of West Berlin, attended the Congress as a representative of the Council of the Protestant Church in Germany, and the Western media reported about it. In 1988, Schorlemmer's Wittenberg peace group presented twenty theses at the Church Congress in Halle, demanding more freedom. On 21 August 1989, Schorlemmer was among the founders of a group called Democratic Awakening (Demokratischer Aufbruch) in Dresden. However, when this group had become a political party in December 1989, Wolfgang Schnur (who was later to be found out to have been a collaborator of the Stasi) and Rainer Eppelmann increasingly worked together with the Christian Democratic Union, Schorlemmer and some other members left it. Schorlemmer joined the East German Social Democrats in the beginning of 1989. At the Alexanderplatz demonstration, Berlin, 4 November 1989 The largest mass meeting in the history of the GDR took place on Alexanderplatz (Alexander Square) in East Berlin on 4 November 1989. Many East Germans were no longer prepared to accept the dictatorship of the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). It was a dangerous situation, with the possibility of a clash between the demonstrators and armed forces. One of the speakers at the Alexanderplatz demonstration was Schorlemmer. He called for change and a new beginning, but he also pleaded for nonviolence. After the Berlin Wall had been opened on 9 November 1989, a lot of people left East Germany. Schorlemmer and others published a passionate appeal to stay and build up a new and better kind of society there: Für unser Land (\\"For our country\\"). Still, the majority of East Germans supported parties like the CDU in the \\"Alliance for Germany\\" (Allianz für Deutschland), which stood for quick re-unification with West Germany. Unification came on 3 October 1990. Schorlemmer remained politically active. He was leader of the SPD in Wittenberg town council from 1990 to 1994. He is chairman of the Willy Brandt Society (Willy-Brandt-Kreis). He is one of the editors of the journal Der Freitag (\\"Friday\\"; a weekly with a daily online edition) and of the monthly Blätter für deutsche und internationale Politik. As a member of the German centre of International PEN, the association of writers, he was among the authors of an open letter in 2004 that asked Muslim intellectuals to protest against international terrorism. He joined the German Commission for UNESCO and the BUND, an organization for the protection of nature and the environment. In 2009, he joined ATTAC, the network of globalization critics. Also, he was one of the founders of the Institut Solidarische Moderne in January 2010. Schorlemmer spoke out against the wars in Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. Schorlemmer was awarded the Carl von Ossietsky Medal of the International League for Human Rights in 1989, the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade in 1993, an honorary doctorate by Concordia University in Austin (Texas) in 2002, and the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 2009. He has published numerous books, essays, speeches and sermons.

Afterward, he joined the Kentucky National Guard, the state militia.\\"Lewis Wilburn and descendants\\", Rootsweb Freepages In 1906, then Lieutenant Wilburn attracted attention by capturing a notorious fugitive criminal.

Black Patch Tobacco Wars In 1907 and 1908, a vigilante group known as The Night Riders terrorized the \\"Black Patch\\" 30-county region of western Kentucky and Tennessee, where Dark Fired Tobacco was produced. The Planters Protective Association of Kentucky and Tennessee had organized to gain more power as growers against the James B. Duke tobacco conglomerate (American Tobacco Company, ATC). It had exercised its monopoly power to lower prices offered to tobacco growers. First working to persuade farmers to join the ATC, the Night Riders received paramilitary training and began to exert harsher power: they whipped disloyal members, murdered opponents, burned buildings and tobacco stores, and temporarily seized entire towns, including three county seats in Kentucky in late 1907 and 1908. In 1908, The New York Times reported, “There now exists in the State of Kentucky a condition of affairs without parallel in the history of the world.\\"Vivian, H.A. “How Crime Is Breeding Crime in Kentucky.” New York Times, 26 JUL 1908 Governor Augustus E. Willson ordered Wilburn and others of the Kentucky Guard with soldiers to end the violence.

The pepper being used is the thumb-sized \\"bhut jolokia,\\" or \\"ghost chili,\\" which had previously been recognized by Guinness World Records as the hottest pepper in the world, but was later superseded by two other pepper cultivars, the Carolina Reaper and the Trinidad moruga scorpion. One bhut jolokia is more than 1,000,000 Scoville units.

It is an active Anglican church in the deanery of Ewecross, the archdeaconry of Craven and the Diocese of Leeds. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The church was built in 1838 to a design by the Lancaster architect Edmund Sharpe. It replaced a small chapel on the other side of Chapel Back that dated back to about 1685. The main person responsible for its creation was Revd Isaac Green, the second master at Sedbergh School, and incumbent of the parish. The land was given by Stephen Sedgwick. The new church was consecrated on 29 October 1838 by the Rt Revd Charles Longley, Bishop of Ripon. Architecture Holy Trinity Church has a simple design in Early English style; it is built in rubble with sandstone dressings and has a slate roof. Its plan consists of a nave with a short chancel. The west front is gabled with buttresses at the corners; it contains three windows and a doorway, above which is a bellcote. On both the north and south sides are six lancet windows, with a buttress between the first and second windows from the west on each side. The chancel is slightly lower than the nave. It has one window on each side, and a triple lancet window at the east end. Internally there is a west gallery, box pews and a panelled font.

In his book, \\"Pay Check\\", he expounds and further develops these ideas, concluding that capitalism has been captured by a new “talent” class of employees, who extract the lion’s share of the rewards within the system without contributing anything new or taking any risk.

Distribution  This species is African, and occurs mainly in East Africa: * Lake Victoria, Kenya, Uganda, (Tanzania) * Lake Ziway, Ethiopia * Lake Albert, Uganda. (Lake Albert is between Uganda and Democratic Republic of the Congo) * Lake Kyoga, Uganda * 13 crater lakes in western Uganda (listed as \\"Biomphalaria pfeifferi/sudanica\\" in these crater lakes)  Phylogeny  A cladogram showing the phylogenic relations of species in the genus Biomphalaria:  Ecology  Biomphalaria sudanica is found in shallow water near the shoreline in Lake Albert. Despite being a pulmonate, Biomphalaria sudanica is well adapted to use the oxygen from water (but not as well as Planorbis). This ability is useful for living in swamp habitats. The population density of Biomphalaria sudanica varies during the year. The highest population density of Biomphalaria sudanica is in Lake Ziway, Ethiopia from June to August, at the end of rainy season. The higher densities of Biomphalaria sudanica occur in habitats with the Common Water Hyacinth Eichhornia crassipes in Lake Victoria.]. It was experimentally detected under laboratory conditions that shells of Biomphalaria sudanica are bigger in waters with higher concentration of calcium than in waters with low calcium. = Parasites = Biomphalaria sudanica is an intermediate host for Schistosoma mansoni and for Schistosoma rodhaini. Infestation with schistosomes in the Lake Victoria basin is about 1%, but can be up to 50% in the case of Schistosoma mansoni and up to 6% in Schistosoma rodhaini in some localities.

It was released on 11 October 2010 as the album's fifth and final single only in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Background When asked what \\"Shampain\\" was about and the production behind the song, Diamandis said: > \\"['Shampain' is about] the depressing side of getting drunk, the > obliteration side of having a good time. This was actually the first co- > write that I ever did... It was good to write a simpler pop song because > when I write on my own the melodies are all over the place. It was good to > do something a little bit lighter, and this probably is my lightest track on > a record. It's about insomnia and the joys of champagne.\\" On co-writing, she added: \\"I hate [co-writing] so I do it because it's so challenging for me. As soon as I do it I am really pleased that I have. I've had the pleasure of working with three great people... 'Shampain' was written with Pascal Gabriel, Liam Howe and we had a lot of fun doing it.\\" \\"Shampain\\" was used in an episode of the BBC Switch teen soap opera The Cut in December 2009. The song had the working title of \\"The Shampain Sleeper\\" in 2009. In 2012, Diamandis expressed her dislike of the song in an interview with BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge, stating it would have been better suited for Kylie Minogue and that its inclusion on the album was by force. Critical reception John Murphy of musicOMH described \\"Shampain\\" as \\"infectiously catchy and [has] enough depth not to be dismissed lightly as bubblegum pop.\\" James Berry of Yahoo! Music stated the song \\"bucks like Goldfrapp riding The Killers' bronco\\". A number of critics had commented negatively regarding the title of the song. Gareth James from Clash opined that the song \\"feel[s] a little forced\\". The Independents Andy Gill wrote that \\"Shampain\\" is \\"every bit as annoying as [its] punning title, with queasy, prancing piano and synth figures labouring away methodically, Mika-fashion, while she searches unsuccessfully for worthwhile lyrical routes.\\" Music video The music video for \\"Shampain\\" was directed by Kim Gehri and filmed on 24 August 2010 in a park in London. It was released on 6 September 2010. The video starts off showing a full moon and a scene where candles are blown out as the title flashes onto the screen. Diamandis is then seen lying on a black silk pillow as the song begins. A burger wrapper flies across her face and the scene cuts to show her lying on the steps at a park bandstand. She stands up and walks through the park, followed by dancing female partygoers intoxicated to be reminiscent of the zombies in Michael Jackson's Thriller. The video ends with Diamandis waking up on a park bench as if the whole video was a dream.

Republican candidate Bob Packwood was re-elected to a third term, defeating Democratic state senator (and future Governor) Ted Kulongoski and Libertarian Tonie Nathan.  Primaries  = Volcano eruption = Mount St. Helens erupted two days before the Oregon primaries. The primary elections were held on May 20, 1980 in conjunction with the Democratic and Republican presidential primaries. Interest in the primaries was somewhat subdued because they occurred just two days after the eruption of Mount St. Helens, about north of Oregon's most populous city, Portland. The eruption (which was a VEI = 5 event) was the first significant one to occur in the contiguous 48 U.S. states since the 1915 eruption of California's Lassen Peak.Fisher, R.V., Heiken, G. & Hulen, J. 1998. Volcanoes:Crucibles of Change, Princeton University Press, 334pp. = Republican primary =  Campaign  In the Republican primary, incumbent Senator Bob Packwood was running for a third term. With his moderate stance on issues such as abortion, several conservative challengers filed to challenge Packwood in the Republican primary. These included Brenda Jose, the vice chairman of the Oregon Republican Party, and Rosalie Huss, who was the wife of Walter Huss, an ultraconservative minister who had been chair of the Oregon Republican Party before being ousted by a moderate and liberal coalition, which included Packwood and Republican governor Victor G. Atiyeh. Packwood went on to defeat all challengers by a wide margin.  Results  = Democratic primary =  Campaign  In the Democratic primary, several high-profile Democrats considered a run, including incumbent U. S. Congressmen Les AuCoin and Jim Weaver and Portland mayor Neil Goldschmidt, but ultimately opted not to challenge the incumbent Packwood. In October 1979, Ted Kulongoski, a labor lawyer and state senator from Junction City, became the first major candidate to declare his candidacy, claiming that Packwood was beholden to large corporate special interests. Kulongoski had the field to himself until March, when former two-term U. S. Congressman Charles O. Porter joined the race. Porter, a Eugene attorney, was a supporter of Edward Kennedy's bid for President and planned to campaign on a strong anti-war platform. Porter and Kulongski agreed on most major issues, clashing only on gun control and nationalization of energy resources, both of which Porter favored and Kulongoski opposed. Though the race was expected to be close, Kulongoski defeated Porter handily by a 5–2 margin.  Results   General election  In addition to the candidates chosen in the primaries, Tonie Nathan was chosen as the Libertarian Party candidate at that party's convention in June. Previously, Nathan had been the Libertarian vice presidential candidate in the 1972 Presidential election and was the first woman to ever receive an electoral vote in a U.S. Presidential election from a faithless elector who voted for her. = Campaign = As a well-funded incumbent, Packwood was expected to have a fairly easy road to re-election and led by double digit margins in most early polls. Packwood chose defense spending as his key issue in the campaign while Kulongoski focused on the economy and unemployment. Nathan hammered at core Libertarian principles of limited government, with a goal of 5% of votes which would keep the party as a valid minor party. The three candidates agreed to three debates, to be held across the state in the summer of 1980. As the challenger, Kulongoski aggressively attempted to engage Packwood in the debates, but the debate format did not allow the candidates to ask follow-up questions or rebut each other's statements and Packwood was largely able to avoid confrontation and stay above the fray. As the campaign wore on, Kulongoski grew more confident and tried to appeal to Oregonians' independent values by saying that Packwood's enormous cash advantage was due to \\"eastern\\" money. Kulongoski closed to within a few points in some late polls, but with no mistakes made by Packwood and with the coattail effect of Ronald Reagan's Presidential victory, the incumbent achieved an electoral majority and a fairly comfortable 8-point margin over Kulongoski. Nathan finished with less than 4% of the vote, short of her goal of 5%. With Republicans taking control of the U.S. Senate, Packwood was in line to become chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. Fellow Oregon Republican Senator Mark Hatfield was also elevated to chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, giving Oregon power in the Senate it had never seen before. = Results =  Aftermath  Packwood served as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee until his appointment to chair the Finance Committee in 1985. He was re-elected to two more terms, in 1986 and 1992. Shortly after the 1992 election, allegations of sexual harassment revealed by The Washington Post led to his eventual resignation from the Senate in 1995. Following his unexpectedly good showing in this race, Kulongoski was the Democratic nominee for Governor in 1982, but lost badly to Republican incumbent Victor G. Atiyeh. In 1987, he was appointed state insurance commissioner by governor Neil Goldschmidt. In 1992, he was elected Oregon Attorney General, in 1997, he was elected to the Oregon Supreme Court. In 2002, 20 years after his initial gubernatorial attempt, Kulongoski was elected as Oregon's 36th Governor and was re-elected in 2006. Nathan ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Congress against Peter DeFazio in 1986 and 1990.

The church is on the street named St Aldate's, opposite Christ Church college and next door to Pembroke College. The church has a large congregation and has a staff team of about 30 which includes clergy, pastoral and administrative staff. The offices of the Rector and other members of staff are at 40 Pembroke Street. History The site has been used for Christian worship dating back to the Saxon era. It may have been one of three churches within the monastic precinct of Saint Frideswide. The first major constructions, in the 12th century, were the nave and chancel, the central part of the building as it now stands. Since then the church has been extended and remodeled at various times. The original tower built during the 13th century was entirely rebuilt in 1873. The south and north aisles - either side of the nave - were added in the 14th and 15th centuries respectively in order to accommodate the growing population of Oxford. The modern church was developed during the nineteenth century, with a remodeling of the interior in 1832. Most notably, during the 46 year ministry of Canon Alfred Christopher, a highly regarded leader from 1859–1905, the north and south chancel aisles and the vestry were added. Further remodeling was completed in 2002. The pews were removed to create more seating room for a growing congregation, under-floor heating, carpet, Jerusalem stone tiles, wood flooring, and a state of the art AV system with projector screens and television monitors were installed to create a modern venue for a living church. Most noticeably, the North Wall was knocked open to create a spacious glass vestibule that opened the church up to the main road of St Aldate’s Street. In addition, the graveyard at the front has been landscaped to open up a garden at the front of the church for tourists and passers-by. Parish St Aldate's is a parish in the Deanery and Diocese of Oxford and therefore comes under the administrative care of the Bishop of Oxford. The church is governed locally by the church leadership (clergy and lay ministers) and the parochial church council, in line with the Church Representation Rules as laid out in the Synodical Government Measure (1969). The Church right Most of the congregation live outside the Parish. Members are drawn from throughout the city and surrounding villages, as far as Grove, Heyford and north towards Banbury. Due to the nature of academic life in Oxford, the congregation is very fluid and it is estimated that up to 30% change each year. There is a range of ages and stages in life in the congregation, with a number of older people, young families, families with teenagers and single people, youth and students. During University terms up to 400 students attend the Sunday services, and during the vacations many tourists and visitors join the congregation. St Aldate's encourages members of the congregation to be involved in the various aspects of the church life and ministry areas and relies heavily on a large number of volunteers who help in the following areas: prayer, administration, catering, maintenance, counselling, stewarding and teaching. Catacombs Youth and Prayer Centre In October 2009 the Catacombs building at 12 Littlegate Street was re-opened by the Bishop of Oxford. Following extensive redevelopment, the ground floor is now a youth centre and the basement has been dedicated as a prayer room for Oxford. In March 2010 the Oxford Prayer Room hosted the first 24-7 week of prayer open to all churches in Oxford, with representatives from over 24 churches attending over the course of the week. Love Oxford In 2006 St Aldate's helped to coordinate an event in Oxford that brought together more than 30 churches in the city for an open-air service in Broad Street on a Sunday morning in June. This event, known as Love Oxford, sought to ‘declare God’s praises’, ‘pray for the peace of the city’ and ‘hear the word of God preached’. It became annual and in 2009 moved to South Park on Headington Hill; about 4,000 people attend. Channel 4 documentary In June 2009, Channel 4 broadcast a documentary, Revelations - How to find God, on the subject of the Alpha course held at St Aldate's earlier that year. The programme is one of eight episodes in the series and was made by Jon Ronson, who was \\"afforded complete access\\" and compiled the final product from around 120 hours of footage.

He became a multi-millionaire through wheat trading, primarily for pasta production, and built up a large business empire. He was involved in financial scandals and served jail terms. He was murdered in a robbery at his home near Naples in 2009. Background Francesco Vittorio Ambrosio was born on 18 September 1932 in San Gennarello, a neighbourhood close to Mount Vesuvius in the Ottaviano frazione of Naples. Career At the age of 18 he joined a wheat milling business near Naples which he rose to lead within 10 years. He renamed the business Italgrani SpA in 1960. Its huge financial growth led to his nickname 'the king of grain' (Italian: il re del grano). Italgrani expanded rapidly in the 1980s into Africa, Australia, and the United States. Ambrosio created a holding company comprising up to 50 companies, importing and exporting various commodities. The businesses gradually unravelled in the 1990s as his involvements in several financial scandals were discovered. He declared the Italgrani company bankrupt in 1999. Parts of Italgrani survived bankruptcy and were sold to new owners. Convictions and imprisonment Franco Ambrosio was arrested several times for fraud and financial irregularities. In October 1993 he was jailed for money laundering and receiving stolen goods in the Enimont corruption scandal, in which a large chemical company was found to have bribed politicians in return for tax relief. In June 1994 he was arrested for attempted bribery and for fraud by claiming EU subsidies for non-existent grain shipments to Algeria. On 10 January 2001, he was arrested for fraud and false accounting. At the time of his death Ambrosio was due in court to appeal against a nine- year prison sentence for false accounting when declaring the bankruptcy of Italgrani. Death On the morning of 15 April 2009 his eldest son Massimo discovered the bodies of Ambrosio and his wife Giovanna Sacco in their seaside villa in Posillipo, Naples. The cause of his death was injuries to the head from a blunt object. There were signs of a robbery: a broken window, possessions scattered and valuables missing. The next day three Romanian immigrants, including one who had worked as his gardener, were arrested and charged with the murder.

History The first Venezuelan opera was El maestro Rufo Zapatero an opera buffa composed in 1848 by José María Osorio.http://www.pdvsa.com/index.php?tpl=interface.sp/design/readmenu_estancia.tpl.html&newsid;_obj_id=6052&newsid;_temas=273 Virginia by José Ángel Montero (sometimes incorrectly called the first Venezuelan opera) debuted in 1877, under the auspices of Antonio Guzmán Blanco. Another major early Venezuelan opera composer was Reynaldo Hahn, who was greatly influenced by his teacher Jules Massenet. He greatly expanded the genre of French operetta, of which Ciboulette was his most famous work; he also composed operas as Le Merchand de Venise.http://www.epdlp.com/compclasico.php?id=1025 Before the foregoing had occurred, José María Osorio had composed early zarzuelas. The first Venezuelan zarzuela to debut, however, was José Ángel Montero's Los alemanes en Italia, in the 1860s. Montero also debuted the zarzuelas El Cumpleaños de Leonor, El Charlatán Mudo, La Modista, and many others. Another major zarzuela composer was Pedro Elías Gutiérrez, who used Venezuelan rhythms. His most important work was perhaps Alma Llanera, with lyrics by Rafael Bolívar Coronado. In the 20th century, Caracas had a rich cultural tradition. Teatro Maderero, Teatro Caracas, and the more modern Teatro Nacional and Teatro Municipal competed for the public's attention. The Teatro Maderero and Teatro Caracas, after the construction of the latter two, played a secondary role and were nearly always used for popular musical acts, such as reviews and fandango. The Teatro Nacional was the theater for the country's finest zarzuela, while the Municipal typically staged Italian, German and French works, which were more serious. Today Venezuelan operas are typically held in the Teatro Teresa Carreño. Contemporary Venezuelan opera composers include María Luisa Escobar, whose works include Kanaime, Orquídeas Azules, and Princesa Girasol. Other important composers are Hector Pellegatti (author of the verismo opera El Negro Miguel with lyrics by Pedro Blanco Vilariño), Alexis Rago (author of El Páramo, Miranda, and Froilán el Infausto), Eric Colon (author of El Caballero de Ledesma), Federico Ruíz (author of the famous opera buffa Los Martirios de Colón, with a libretto by Aquiles Nazoa). Other recent premieres include the opera Gertrudis by Gerardo Gerulewicz, with a libretto by Xiomara Moreno, which premiered in concert and in full stage production in Caracas, Venezuela. Venezuelan-American composer Sylvia Constantinidis who has written music and libretto for several lyrical works: two dramatic contemporary operas, Araminta and Afrodita; one experimental short opera, Aurora; and three children operas, Lincoln, Ponce de Leon, and The First ThanksGiving. Some scenes from Araminta were premiered in concert in England 2017. Afrodita was premiered in concert in England 2015 and in Miami, USA, also in 2015. Aurora, the experimental short opera, was premiered in England in 2011. The three children operas: Lincoln, Ponce de Leon, and The First ThanksGiving, were all premiered in Florida, USA, in 2001, 2002, and 2003.

The 2011 French film 17 Girls is based on the same events. Plot 28-year-old Sidney Bloom, an alumna of Gloucester High, publishes a video blog about teen issues. Learning that her old high school has reported ten to eighteen teen pregnancies in the last eight weeks, Sidney investigates the situation. Gloucester High nurse Kim tells Sidney that students have requested 150 pregnancy test kits in recent weeks. Nurse Kim requests birth control provided in the school, but her request is declined. When Sidney interviews local students, she encounters Sara, Karissa, Iris, and Rose, who imagine an ideal life as mothers. Three of the four are already pregnant and urging the fourth, Sara, to imitate them. Having permission from her mother Lorraine, Sara goes to her boyfriend Jesse's house, against the wishes of her father Michael, and becomes pregnant with fear of 'losing' Jesse's affection. Her friends are pleased, but Karissa's mother is struggling financially, and her boyfriend leaves her upon learning of the pregnancy. When Sara's father learns the same of Sara, he accuses Jesse, and later quarrels with Lorraine. Sara and Lorraine's relationship deteriorates leading Sidney to console Sara. It is revealed that Sidney and a school faculty member, Brady, had a baby at the age of 16, which Sidney gave for adoption. Jesse tells Sara that his father is willing to pay for an abortion, but Sara tells him to cancel his plans for college and a career in baseball to start their family together. Lorraine proposes a meeting of the school council to raise funds for the school's daycare. Sidney, in attendance, asks instead for birth control and reveals Sara's pregnancy, resulting in Lorraine resigning from the council. A news story in Time Magazine quotes the school's principal that the girls informed him of their hopes and starts a media frenzy. Jesse's father tells him he should focus on college and baseball instead of Sara which cause a fallout between them. Rose confirms the story to Sidney and discuss why the girls wanted to become mothers. Sidney and Sara have a private conversation. Sara tells Sidney that her dream is to marry Jesse and have a family, not viewing a college education or a career as a priority; Jesse, in contrast, wants to attend college and pursue a career in professional baseball. A call from Karissa confirms that Rose gave birth to a baby girl, her friends are shocked by the difficulties of labor probably caused by her smoking during the pregnancy. She requires 37 stitches from vaginal tearing and the baby in an incubator. Jesse and Lorraine having overheard Sidney asking Sara to publish her revelation, Jesse rejects Sara. During a party, Karissa's mother confronts her, saying that she herself struggled hard as a single mother and wants a better future for her and not to make the same choice. At the party, Sara again apologizes to Jesse profusely but he refuses to forgive her and confesses that he can never trust her again and does not want anything to do with the baby or her. Jesse also tearfully confessed that she ruined all chances of them being together forever. Feeling rejected and hurt, Sara binge drinks which led to her nearly succumbing to alcohol poisoning but later reconciles with her parents. Lorraine convinces the school council to keep her on the board and argues for the school to offer birth control and encourage abstinence. An epilogue, Sidney reveals that the principal resigned as a scapegoat to the media and that the school's daycare center is full, likely causing most girls to leave school for better daycare. She then stresses that parents must be particular when advising their children about love, family and relationships, and wishes the new mothers 'the very best of luck'. Rose is miserable in new motherhood as her family ridicules her of having a baby too young. During the final months of her pregnancy, Sara sees Jesse with his new girlfriend. Although content with the baby, she is still sad to see what it would have been like if she was not pregnant and still be with him, planning for college. She eventually regrets getting pregnant so young and would have waited years than rushing into it to make Jesse stay. The film concludes with Sara happily raising her baby girl, with the support of her parents.

Listen to the first Elegie's carefully gauged climaxes, the subtle gradations in tone that help flesh out Nuages gris' sparse textures, the warm legato that embraces Romance oubliée's soft chords, or how the pianist imbues the Bagatelle ohne Tonart's [ Bagatelle sans tonalité ] grace notes with a convincing jazzy flair.”Jed Distler, Gramophone Magazine (Aug, 2009) gramophone.co.uk Phoenix Classical writes, \\"As with any Liszt works, these shorter pieces require a pianist of utmost skill and artistry, and Alexander Djordjevic brings formidable talent and technique to these works, coupled with a profound poetic sensitivity to the music. Gray Clouds features a number of Liszt’s sacred works for solo piano – the “Stabat Mater”, “Vexilla Regis Prodeunt” & “Sancta Dorothea” are among those on this collection, and Djordjevic gives each of these works a stately, yet reflective tone, bringing out their grasping for the divine, while works such as the well-known “En Rêve Nocturne” exude the spirit of Romanticism, and the incredibly original “Bagatelle sans tonalité” points towards the 20th century.

After graduating the United States Military Academy at West Point, he served in the Second Seminole War. During the Mexican–American War he was promoted to the rank of captain and brevetted temporarily to the rank of lieutenant colonel. During the American Civil War, he served in command of artillery batteries at various forts and was eventually placed in command of the 4th United States Artillery Regiment with the rank of colonel. At the close of the civil war, he was awarded the honorary grade of brevet brigadier general. He continued his career as a soldier after the Civil War, remaining in command of the 4th U.S. Artillery until his retirement in 1877.Bowen, 891–892. Early service Born in Boston, Brooks was sponsored in his early military career by the Marquis de Lafayette who was a friend of his mother's family.Seaver, 24. Nominated by Lafayette, Brooks entered West Point on July 1, 1831 and graduated in 1835. He was appointed second lieutenant and assigned to the 2nd United States Artillery Regiment. Just months after graduating, Brooks saw combat when his regiment was deployed to Florida during the Second Seminole War. As part of a small force under the command of Brig. Gen. Duncan Lamont Clinch, Brooks participated in the Battle of Withlacoochee against the Seminole during which he was commended by Clinch for his bravery.United Service, 535–536. Following this action, Brooks served as Clinch's adjutant and was brevetted first lieutenant for his service. Brooks served in the Mexican–American War from 1846 to 1848, achieving the official rank of captain and the brevet rank of lieutenant colonel. During the years leading up to the Civil War, he was in command of the light battery school at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. Civil War In February 1861, with hostilities increasing and the prospect of Civil War imminent, Capt. Brooks's battery was transferred to Fort McHenry in Baltimore. He played an important role in readying the Fort for combat. In April, he was sent to Fort Pickens which was, at that time, threatened by Confederate forces. In November 1861, the Trent Affair increased tensions between the United States and Great Britain and Brooks was transferred to Fort Jefferson in the Florida Keys to prepare for possible attack by the British. During 1861, Brooks was promoted twice, attaining the rank of lieutenant colonel by the end of the year. In 1862, Brooks became a superintendent of the recruiting service and was transferred to Ohio. On August 1, 1863, he was promoted to colonel and placed in command of the 4th U.S. Artillery Regiment. The regiment was assigned to the defenses of Washington, D.C. Brooks played a significant role in planning the overall defenses of the capitol. For meritorious service during the war, he was brevetted brigadier general, U.S. Army (Regular Army), by nomination of President of the United States Andrew Johnson on June 30, 1866 and confirmation by the U.S. Senate on July 25, 1866, to rank from March 13, 1865.Eicher, John H. and Eicher, David J., Civil War High Commands, p. 732.

As a resistance member he is best known for the Lysaker Bridge sabotage as well as operating illegal radio transmitters. After the war he was a businessman and Scouting leader. He wrote books and contributed to a film based on his war experience. Early life He was born in Aker. He grew up in Bestum and graduated from middle school at Ullern in 1934. He then took commerce school and took pilot education in the airline Widerøe's Flyveselskap. World War II =Sabotage and escape= When World War II reached Norway with a German invasion on 9 April 1940, he started resistance work on the same day. On the night between 13 and 14 April he blew up the Lysaker Bridge together with Kåre Moe and Leif Moe. This sabotage had national-level repercussions, in that it contributed to the surfacing of the Administrative Council on the next day. The Germans soon took control over Norway, and Reed-Olsen and Kåre Moe were sent to photograph and spy on German installations, most importantly at Oslo Airport, Fornebu. Reed- Olsen had easier access around town because he had joined the civil firefighting squad of Furulund as a team leader and owned a motorbike. They were caught after breaking into a crashed aircraft at Fornebu. Although the Germans did not know the nature of their actions, they were apprehended and sent to Oslo. However, at Lysaker Bridge the lorry slowed down because of the bridge damage and the two escaped from the lorry, jumped into Lysakerelva, swam further down and eventually careered to their homes.Reed-Olsen, 1945: pp. 46–48 The two fled Norway by boat from Bestumkilen on 2 September. Reed-Olsen bought the boat after selling his motorbike.Reed-Olsen, 1945: p. 54 They first sailed down the Norwegian coast and picked up a third man Rolf Gabrielsen whom they met in Mandal.Reed-Olsen, 1945: pp. 69–71 They finally left for the United Kingdom from Farsund on 14 September.Reed-Olsen, 1945: p. 73 According to Reed-Olsen, they had almost reached the Aberdeen district when the wind turned and brought them as far east as Jutland. After the wind turned again, they almost reached the Thames, when on 29 September they were picked up by the British destroyer .Reed-Olsen, 1945: pp. 93–96 After a diversion when the ship had to salvage crashed pilots (one of five was alive), the Norwegians set foot in Edinburgh on 4 October.Reed-Olsen, 1945: pp. 98–99 =Air service and intelligence= They soon travelled to London. They reported at the Norwegian recruiting office, spent one month in the city before leaving for Canada via Scotland, on the ocean liner SS Duchess of Richmond.Reed-Olsen, 1945: p. 112 They reached Toronto and were drafted into the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service. They were stationed on the Norwegian steamship before the training camp Little Norway opened,Reed-Olsen, 1945: pp. 114–117 and then about three months at Toronto Flying Club before finally going to Little Norway.Reed- Olsen, 1945: p. 142 Reed-Olsen graduated from the air force academy there in 1941. They then went on a fourteen-day boat trip from Halifax, Canada via England and Scotland to Iceland.Reed-Olsen, 1945: p. 158, 162–165 He served in the No. 330 Squadron RAF. From 1942 he underwent training in intelligence, telegraphy and parachuting. On 20 April 1943 he was paradropped over Eiker, from whence he bicycled to Southern Norway. He performed intelligence radio broadcasts from the Birkenes district and elsewhere. He served the Secret Intelligence Service. In the autumn of 1943 he operated the radio station codenamed Meton in Lommedalen together with Hjelm Waage Thurn-Basberg, with whom he had worked in Southern Norway. Meton was one of nine illegal transmitters in Bærum; four of these belonged to the Secret Intelligence Service. It was also transmitted from Kolsås for a short time. Both Reed-Olsen and Thurn-Basberg fled to England via Sweden shortly thereafter. Reed-Olsen then had another stay in Norway before going to Canada again. In 1944 he married Joan Whiteside in Toronto. Lastly, he went on a fundraiser tour in the United States for the post-war rebuilding of Norway. For his efforts he was decorated with the War Cross With Sword and the Distinguished Service Cross. Post-war life After the war he worked for the Royal Norwegian Air Force (as a Captain), then the civil companies Det Norske Luftfartsselskap and Norsk Brændselolje before becoming an independent businessman. He also dedicated himself to Scouting, arranged summer camps at Håøya and was a board member of the Norwegian Guide and Scout Association. He chronicled his war experiences in the books Contact (1946, reissued 1983) and Vi kommer igjen (1953), (published in English as Two Eggs On My Plate). The first book was made into the motion picture Kontakt in 1956, with Reed-Olsen contributing as a screenwriter and actor. He died in October 2002 in Oslo.

Elscint's shares traded on the NASDAQ as well as on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. At its height, Elscint was a world leader in the development of medical imaging technologies. Most of Elscint's activities were sold to GE Healthcare and Philips Medical Systems. History =1969–1974: Early years= Elscint (perhaps a portmanteau of the words \\"electronic\\" and \\"scientific, but more likely of \\"El\\" as in \\"El Al\\", and \\"Scint\\", as in scintillation, referring to the type of radiation detector used in Nuclear Medicine as in Elscint's first products.) was founded in 1969 by Dr. Avraham Suhami, who was a nuclear physics professor at the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology at the time, after receiving encouragement to apply his scientific and technical knowledge for commercial applications from Uzia Galil, founder of Elron, a technology investment company.Elron's story - Technology Investment With Vision Elscint was founded as a subsidiary of Elron with an initial investment of 250.000 US dollars, Suhami was appointed as the company's CEO and Dan Tolkovsky (who was the CEO of Discount Investment Corporation parent of Elron at the time) was appointed as Chairman. The first product developed by the company was a nuclear measurement device for laboratory testing, but since the entire global market for the device was a few hundred units, which sold for $ 800 only, it was decided to refocus on the field of medical imaging. Elscint's first product in this field was a nuclear camera designed to detect cancer, but it failed commercially. Later, the company developed the VDP1, a gamma scanner used to monitor radioactive isotopes in the body. The product, sold at a price of $ 25,000 and was the first in the world with digital imaging capability.Elscint Ltd. - Company history FundingUniverse This VDP1 was the Elscint's first commercial success, and helped the company to reach sales of a million dollars, with a loss of $ 25,000 at the end of first year of operation. The VDP1 product was displayed in trade show in Los Angeles and drew the attention of General Electric, the world leader in medical imaging; and in 1971, Elscint and General Electric signed an exclusive distribution agreement in North America. General Electric insisted that the product met its quality standards, forcing the young company to expand its technical capabilities and its manufacturing capabilities quickly. In 1972, in order to bring the company's products to world markets outside North America, Elscint opened its first international sales and marketing subsidiary in Belgium. IPO on NASDAQ In 1971, Fred Adler, an East Coast venture capitalist, invested in Elscint and 1972 helped the company undertake an initial public offering on the NASDAQ, making Elscint the first Israeli company to list on the NASDAQ.The growth of venture capital: a cross-cultural comparison edited by Dilek Çetindamar, p 277 =1975–1989: Expansion= By 1975, sales of gamma scanners and other products generated $12 million in revenue, and a profit of $ 400,000 for Elscint, and Avraham Suhami decided to enter a new market - Computerized tomography, at the time a new emerging medical imaging technology. The company spent 2 years developing a Computerized tomography scanner, which it started selling in 1977. The company's sales began a steady growth, from $21 million in 1979 to $42 million in 1981. That year, Elscint, which by that time had provided more than 100 CT scanners to hospitals and research institutes around the world, acquired Pfizer's CT scanner business. Elscint's market share grow to 10 percent by the middle of the 1980s. In the first half of the eighties Elscint acquired several other companies and also expanded its product offering to nuclear cameras, ultrasound, digital and conventional X-ray equipment, thus providing products for all medical imaging technologies. In addition, the company began developing its own equipment for the latest breakthrough in medical imaging at the time, magnetic resonance imaging systems. By 1983 the company had sales of $132 million and a net profit of $12.6 million. The company had more than 3,000 employees in factories, research and development facilities in Boston, England, Paris, Milan, Jerusalem, Haifa and Chicago. =Breakup= In 1990 Elbit Computers Ltd, a sister company of Elscint, and a subsidiary of Elron, acquired a majority share in Elscint.Elbit Computers Ltd. announces acquisition of controlling interest in Elscint PR Newswire, January 5, 1990 In 1996, Elbit Computers was spun off into three independent companies, one of them Elbit Medical Imaging became the holding company of Elscint. During 1999 and 2000, Elscint and Elbit Medical Imaging sold their imaging activities to GE Healthcare and to Philips Medical Systems for approximately $600 million.Elbit sells off Elscint businesses through deals with Picker and GE Diagnostic Imaging September 16, 1998 In 1992, Elscint introduced _Elscint CT Twin_ , the world's first multi-slice (actually it was double-slice) CT scanner. This system could acquire two images with every rotation of the gantry, this was something no other scanner in the world at the time could do. After the Twin the company wished to create a 4 slice system, but this would require a totally new gantry design. In an effort to save time the company decided to sell the multi-slice detector design to Siemens in exchange for their gantry and table. This allowed Siemens to enter into the multi-slice CT game and Elscint shorter to market time for the system that was to be known as the VolumeX. The VolumeX was never produced. By the time it was ready the company was sold to Picker and GE. By 1996, Elscint's revenues reached $311 million. In 1999, Elron Electronic Industries sold all its holdings in Elbit Medical Imaging to Europe Israel Ltd., formerly an Israeli company listed on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange and controlled by real estate developer Mordechay (Moti) Zisser, for a sum of approximately $127.8 million. Following the acquisition in May 1999, Zisser integrated his existing real estate activities into the company and restructured Elbit Medical Imaging as a holding company, focusing on: real estate, hotels development, shopping and entertainment malls. In 2005, Elscint was delisted and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Elbit Medical Imaging.

Present-day American and Russian prisoners may convey gang membership, code, or hidden meanings for origin or criminal deeds. Lack of proper equipment and sterile environments lead to health risks such as infection or disease (hepatitis C, HIV) from contaminated needles. Process Since tattooing in prison is illegal in the United States, the inmates do not have the proper equipment necessary for the practice. This forces inmates to find ways to create their own tattooing devices out of their belongings and found materials. Improvised tattooing equipment has been assembled from materials such as mechanical pencils, magnets, radio transistors, staples, paper clips, or guitar strings. In addition to the tattooing equipment, the ink utilized also needs to be improvised—potentially consisting of ink taken from pens, melted plastic, soot mixed with shampoo, and melted Styrofoam. Prison tattoos are not generally applied free of charge; they are usually done in exchange for food, stamps, cigarettes, phone time, canteen items, or favors. Motifs There are many different symbols and numbers that represent multiple gangs or groups. Certain images, like spider webs, can represent the length of sentences. The well-known teardrop tattoo can signify that the wearer was raped while incarcerated or, reportedly particularly in West Coast gang contexts, that the wearer has killed someone. Tattoos are also used to communicate who the inmates are as people—for example, white supremacists will display prominent tattoos to show their beliefs. Some common symbols used in this manner are: the percentile 100%, a white supremacist indicator of racial purity; Valknuts; swastikas. Runic insignia of the Schutzstaffel (\\"lightning bolts\\") are sometimes awarded to members of white gangs for assigned assaults on other races.http://www.foto8.com/live/prison-tattoos-2/ Three dots arranged as a triangle (∴) mean \\"mi vida loca\\" or \\"my crazy life\\" to Mexican inmates linked to the Mexican Mafia, while four dots (∷) have the same meaning, but are found on Mexican gang members associated with the Nuestra Familia; a clock with no hands represents \\"doing time\\"; spider webs are a symbol of being trapped; or the number 13 to signify being unlucky. One common prison tattoo is the five dots tattoo, a quincunx usually placed on the hand, with different meanings in different cultures. Mostly seen in the UK but used elsewhere too, four dots tattooed across the knuckles stand for ACAB (All Cops Are Bastards). Or a dot on each hand in between the thumb and forefinger—one meaning going into prison, and one meaning they have completed their sentence. In Ireland, a common tattoo ex-inmates give themselves is a simple dot placed under the eye using Indian ink, colloquially known as a \\"jail dot.\\" A Borstal dot also meant doing time, but this tattoo has become a lot less common since Borstals were abolished. Another less common prison tattoo dates back to Borstals, which earned itself the name the \\"Borstal glove,\\" is the back of the criminal's hand outlined and just full of Indian ink. A spider web usually located on the elbow, symbolizes time served in prison. Risks Since the tattoo machines are homemade and efficient means of sterilization are not available, there are many health risks involved. Deadly diseases like hepatitis and HIV/AIDS can be passed from one person to the next through shared needles. Also, the makeshift ink can damage the skin, cause permanent scarring, or contain harmful chemicals. Tattoo equipment is also considered contraband, and tattooing can be considered by prison officials to be a punishable form of self-mutilation. The Federal Bureau of Prisons in 2011 reclassified tattooing as a high severity prohibited act.https://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/5270_009.pdf See also * Russian criminal tattoos * Criminal tattoo * Teardrop tattoo * Black- and-gray References Category:Tattooing traditions Category:Penal imprisonment Category:Tattoos by type ","title":"Prison tattooing"},{"id":"26672885","text":"Euchloe daphalis is a butterfly of the family Pieridae.

Oster claims that the ET3 system will be able to provide 50 times the amount of transportation per kilowatt-hour compared with electric cars and electric trains, costing only 20 cents' worth of electrical energy to get up to . ET3 claims that initial systems would travel at the speed of for in state trips, and later will be developed to 6,500 km/h (4,000 mph, hypersonic speed) for international travel that will allow passenger or cargo travel from New York to Beijing in 2 hours.

Using icons and stereotypes of American popular culture, he creates works that address personal and collective experiences of race and class. He is best known for his \\"erasure drawings,\\" in which he draws in white chalk on slate-painted panels or walls, then smudges them with his hands – a technique that renders their imagery ghostly. Work and exhibitions =Early work= Simmons received his BFA from the School of Visual Arts in 1988. He received his MFA from CalArts in 1990 and received both the National Endowment for the Arts Interarts Grant and the Penny McCall Foundation Grant shortly after. Shortly after his graduate studies, Simmons found a studio back home at a former vocational school in Manhattan, New York. His space was empty but for several old-fashioned, wooden, rolling classroom chalkboards, which he began using as canvases in a series of early works about mis-education and conceptions of racial and class identity. Interested in the medium's ambiguous and impermanent nature, he worked with chalk on boards or on walls painted with chalkboard paint almost exclusively in the 1990s. In these works, he often borrowed imagery from antique cartoons that depicted black caricatures. In a wall drawing called Wall of Eyes, commissioned for the 1993 Whitney Biennial, the black surface of board is peppered with bodiless cartoon eyes of different sizes.Gary Simmons, published by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, 2002. = Erasures series = Simmons's most well-known body of work is his Erasures series. He started this in the 1990s and continues to do wall paintings in a very similar style. Chalkboards make an ideal medium because it alludes to teaching and learning. He's repurposed the place where history is taught and uses erasure to redraw the lines of power. He recreates cartoons that depict black caricatures, some clear and some erased into a dreamy blur. These caricatures refer to when the black stereotype in media was a slap- happy, carefree, musical entertainer. The erasing attempts make the images ethereal and almost ghost like. The erasing is a form of mark making in itself. There's a sweeping movement to it that contrasts with the tight lines of the unmarked cartoon. He's bringing up America's dark past to deface it, but he still wants it to be recognized. He has many exhibitions that feature this style. One of his large-scale wall drawings was most recently shown at Metro Pictures Gallery in Midnight Matinee, an exhibition of paintings and drawings which, like the installation Split Personality, depict semi-erased black-on-black drawings of settings from 1970s horror films. =Sculpture and installation= Considering himself primarily a sculptor, Simmons early three- dimensional work incorporated powerfully suggestive symbols of oppression including Ku Klux Klan signs, hoods and nooses. One work, entitled Duck, Duck Noose (1992) has chairs in a circle with KKK hoods on each one. In the center of the chairs, a noose hangs from the ceiling. In Klan Gate (1992), two brick pillars surround a large cast iron gate. Atop each pillar stands a stone carved Klan member. In a later work, Big Still (2001), Simmons addresses the state of the poor whites in Appalachia and the South. He recreated a prohibition era moonshine rig that was used by poor rural Appalachian whites. He's commenting on the concept of \\"white trash,\\" and that their disenfranchised life was similar to the urban black communities. However the sculpture is large and intimidating, representing the virulent racism of the time. =Exhibitions= His paintings, drawings and sculptures have exhibited throughout the US and internationally at Metro Pictures Gallery,Bio from Metro Pictures Gallery website.

TFC has 54 member co-ops that are owned by some 64,000 farmers across the state. The cooperative's production and distribution centers are located at Tenco near Maryville in East Tennessee and Jackson in West Tennessee. TFC serves more than half a million customers through 164 retail outlets located in 84 of Tennessee's 95 counties as well as several locations in neighboring states of Kentucky, Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina, Arkansas, Missouri, and Mississippi. In 2014, TFC had consolidated sales of nearly $770 million. Tennessee Cooperator. January 2015.  History  Tennessee Farmers Co-op feed mill at the La Vergne headquarters manufactures a wide variety of animal feed products. At the conclusion of World War II, Tennesseans began to show an intense interest in forming their own farm supply business. Their dream was to have a dependable source for production inputs needed in their farming operations. After careful study of farm supply cooperatives in other states, it was the recommendation of a special committee appointed by the Tennessee Farm Bureau Federation, under the leadership of Al Jerdan, University of Tennessee marketing specialist, that a federated cooperative system be established in Tennessee. Through the combined efforts of the 33 county associations already established and the Tennessee Farm Bureau Federation, TFC received its charter of incorporation from the state on Sept. 27, 1945.Tennessee Dept. of State #000070715 TFC headquarters were originally established in Columbia. They were later moved to Nashville and eventually to La Vergne, where they are still located.  Local cooperative structure  Each of TFC's member Co-ops is a separate, independent cooperative business controlled by farmer members. The farmer members, each of whom owns one share of voting stock, are responsible for electing a local board of directors, which establishes that particular co-op's policies and employs the general manager. The daily operation of the business is under the direction and supervision of the general manager, who answers to the board of directors. Another feature of the federated cooperative is that any savings above the cost of doing business are returned to the member patron on a patronage basis. Because savings are distributed locally, the money remains in the area where the Co-op is located.  State cooperative structure  The cooperative system in Tennessee is divided into three zones, roughly reflecting the three Grand Divisions of the state — East, Middle, and West Tennessee. Three farmer–members from each zone are elected by member Co-ops to represent them on TFC's board of directors. With its headquarters in La Vergne and facilities in East and West Tennessee, TFC has a total of three distribution centers, three fertilizer plants, five feed mills, a metal fabrication plant, a farm equipment facility, and a maintenance shop. In addition, a seed conditioning and vegetable and lawn seed packaging facility are located at Halls in West Tennessee, and TFC operates barge terminals in Nashville and Ft.

It was built by the Holkars of the Maratha Empire about two centuries ago. This seven storied structure is located near the Chhatris and serves today as a fine example of royal grandeur and architectural skills.  Structure  The structure comprises two parts, the first one located at the heart of the city and the second one standing in the old part of the town. Rajwada palace exhibits a blend of Maratha styles, the palatial structure is sure to leave you spellbound. The entrance itself is beautiful with lofty archway and a giant wooden door covered with iron studs. As one makes his way through the entrance, one is greeted with a courtyard comprising Maratha arched Ganesha hall, a number of balconies with Maratha ornamentation, windows, and corridors, surrounded by galleried rooms. The lower three floors are made of stone and the upper floors are made of wood. The existing building is rectangular with cylindrical bastions at the four corners. It was constructed in 1766 and later the southern part was rebuilt in the years 1811–1833 after being damaged by fire. The Palace was constructed by the Muslim artisans from Mandu who worked for the Marathas but sought refuge in Malwa with their families, At that time only the Muslims were the most skilled crafts persons. These families lived in and around Indore and went on to work for several structures for the Holkars. Today it stands proudly with its 7-story façade of carved stone and wood jails, jharokhas and chattries. The front bay has substantial forecourt assessed by a large fenestration in the front façade. All activity within this structure has been systematically removed and now boasts of a small office of the Joint Director, Archeology and Souvenir Shop run by the Archeology. The rest of the building is ground and two floors. One side of the front bay has been destroyed as has the complete rear bay. The rear bay, before reconstruction was an empty shell with garden within, enveloped by the thick external wall with the bastions. The architecture is of the Maratha period & style. Planned with courtyards suited to tropical climes the Maratha architecture is known for its simplicity, visible visual logic & austere aesthetic, made rich by beautiful detailing, rhythm & repetition. The aisles & arcades, punctured by delicate niches, doors & windows create a space in which articulation of open, semi-open & covered areas is effortless and enchanting. The Rajwada is now state property under the Archeology who granted special permission for rebuilding the old wada (residence) which was the main Rajwada which was completely burnt during the 1984 riots, namely the building around the Tulsi Kund along with the temple that previously existed there, between the two rear courtyards. This building was to be rebuilt by H.H Usha Raje Holkar and designed by architects Himanshu Dudwadkar and Shreya Bhargava on the 200-year-old blue print using the same material & finishes, while adhering to the seismic structural requirements, mandatory today. The rebuilding was to be identical to what existed earlier – constructed with thin bricks in lime mortar with lime plaster, with wooden columns with stone bases, rough black basalt flooring & a brick paved courtyard in tandem with the age-old building techniques. The only departure from the original building was a concealed ms pipe frame for structural stability in this earthquake prone zone – a necessity to obtain relevant building permissions.

The story of their martyrdom is enshrouded in myth, and though they share the same feast day, the saints were not martyred together or at the same time. According to their Passion, Emperor Probus decreed that all Christians should sacrifice to the Roman gods. The Emperor sent two officials, Trophimus and Sabbatius, to Antioch. However, after Trophimus and Sabbatius arrived at the city, they were so shocked by the tortures inflicted upon the Christians there that the two men converted to Christianity. Trophimus and Sabbatius were arrested and tortured; Sabbatius died as a result of being tortured. Trophimus was sent to Synnada in Asia Minor. Imprisoned at Synnada was a Christian senator named Dorymedon, and Trophimus visited the senator in prison. Officials in Synnada attempted to force Dorymedon and Trophimus to sacrifice to the gods Castor and Pollux. Dorymedon and Trophimus refused and were tortured and sentenced to be thrown to wild beasts in the arena. According to their Passion, the beasts refused to harm the two saints. The saints were then decapitated. Their legend is of questionable historicity. As Christopher Walter points out, Probus did not persecute Christians to the same extent that Emperors Diocletian or Decius did. A reliquary in the form of a sarcophagus containing some of the bones of Trophimus was discovered at Schifout Kassaba (Synnada) in 1907, and transported to the museum at Bursa; this monument may date back to the third century.See Mendel in Bulletin de Correspondance Hellénique, XXXIII (1909), 342 sq.

He was a member of the Phagmodrupa Dynasty which was the major Tibetan power from 1354 to 1435. His time was one of political stability in Central Tibet, and the establishment of amicable relations with the Ming dynasty of China. Youth and ascent to power Jamyang Shakya Gyaltsen was the eldest son of Sonam Zangpo, a brother of the founder of the Phagmodrupa regime, Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen. His mother was Damo Nyetuma. When nine years of age he was made a monastic novice. In 1352 he was elevated to boy- abbot of the see of Tsethang. The young abbot was close to the well-known scholar Buton Rinchen Drub, who praised his wide knowledge in religious matters. According to Buton, \\"if in front of all fields of Yarlung from Gonpo Dongri different mandalas were to be dedicated, he could cover all these fields\\", meaning that he had the initiation in all mandalas, and could ensure sacral protection of the fields.Giuseppe Tucci, Deb T'er Dmar Po Gsar Ma. Rome 1971, p. 211. When his uncle Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen died at the end of 1364, Jamyang Shakya Gyaltsen succeeded him as regent (desi) of Tibet, but also kept his religious position. His powers in the first hand applied to the central parts of Tibet (Ü and Tsang). Relations with the Yuan and the Ming At the time of Jamyang Shakya Gyaltsen's accession, the Mongol Yuan Dynasty was at its last throes, and had little or no opportunity to intervene in the affairs of Tibet like before. In 1365, however, the new regent received the title Gushri and the investiture of the Nêdong district, the original fief of the Phagmogrupa line, from the emperor Toghon Temür. In 1368 the latter lost the imperial throne, and the Ming Dynasty took power in China. The Mingshi or dynastic annals say: \\"In the beginning of the fifth year Hongwu [1372] the [commander of the] garrison of Hezhou said that in the country of Pamuzhuba [Phagmodrupa] in Ü and Tsang there was a monk who was called Zhangyang Shajia Jiancang [Jamyang Shakya Gyaltsen], to whom in the Yuan's times, had been given the title of Guanding Guoshi, and to whom the barbarians had been entrusted. Now Shangzhu Jiancang [Changchub Gyaltsen, another person than the regent's predecessor], the chief of Dogan [Do Kham], fought against Guan Wuer. If that monk of Pamuzhuba had been sent to persuade him, Dogan would certainly have become a subject of the Chinese Empire. The Emperor accepted this advice, and again appointed that monk Guanding Guoshi, and sent envoys to him to give him the jade seal and coloured silk.\\"Giuseppe Tucci, Tibetan Painted Scrolls. Rome 1949, Vol. II, p. 692. Whether this information should be taken as face value, and imply the introduction of Ming governance, is disputed between Western and Tibetan historians on one hand, and Chinese on the other; at any rate, the Phagmodrupa governance kept its own administration and political network without direct Chinese intervention.Wang Furen & Suo Wenqing, Highlights of Tibetan History. Beijing 1984, pp. 48-9; Martin Slobodník, \\"The relations between the Chinese Ming Dynasty and the Tibetan ruling house of Phag-mo-gru in the years 1368-1434: political and religious aspects\\", Asian and African Studies 13, p. 168. End of the reign The rule of Jamyang Shakya Gyaltsen was generally tranquil. According to the Debther marpo sarma he only once had to wage a war against enemies in the Tsang region, which met with complete success.Giuseppe Tucci, 1971, p. 212. Other sources, however, suggest that his grip on the Tsang region was incomplete, and that the rising principality of Gyantse halted his troops in 1364 and 1369.Karl-Heinz Everding, \\"Gyantse (rGyal rtse): Rise, Prime and Decline of a Tibetan Principality in the 14th-16th Centuries\\", in Volker Caumanns and Marta Sernesi (eds), Fifteenth Century Tibet: Cultural Blossoming and Political Unrest. Lumbini, 2017, p. 41. In 1373 the regent organized a large council in the original fief of the dynasty, Nêdong. This event marked a highlight of the domination of the Phagmodrupa. The regent died at the end of the same year. Although he had taken monastic vows, he had a son called Drakpa Rinchen. This person was not in the line of succession; his descendants became local chiefs of Gemo.Giuseppe Tucci, 1971, p. 212. Instead, the deceased regent was briefly succeeded by his younger brother Shakya Rinchen, who lost his reason after an accident. After this incident, the dignity of regent went to a nephew called Drakpa Changchub.A. Macdonald, 'Préambule à la lecture d'un Rgya-Bod yig- chan', Journal asiatique 1963, p. 101.

The pseudolulo is a large herbaceous plant or a small shrub, with heart-shaped leaves. The leaves and stems of the plant are covered in short hairs, and the entire plant is often covered in sharp spines. Occasionally known as lulo de perro, the pseudolulo bears edible fruit, but is rarely cultivated. Instead, the plant proliferates as a weedy species at medium- altitude locations in Colombia and Ecuador. The fruit is generally regarded as inferior to the true lulo - naranjilla - but the fruit is occasionally sold in markets, and the plant is generally tolerated as a garden intruder. Unlike the lulo/naranjilla, the pseudolulo thrives in sunnier locations. The fruit is a large berry, green when unripe, ripening to yellow or yellow-orange. The orange or yellow flesh is filled with an abundance of small seeds. The fruit is covered with hairs which detach when the fruit has ripened. Some botanists consider the pseudolulo to be worthy of investigation as an agricultural fruit plant. (2005): Solanum pseudolulo. Version of December 2005. Retrieved 2008-SEP-25. Classification Within the genus Solanum, S. pseudolulo is a part of the leptostemonum clade. Within this clade, S. pseudolulo belongs to the Lasiocarpa clade.

Various orbital crafts have used spectroscopic methods to identify the signature of some minerals. The planetary landers performed concrete chemical analysis of the soil in rocks to further identify and confirm the presence of other minerals. The only samples of Martian rocks that are on Earth are in the form of meteorites. The elemental and atmospheric composition along with planetary conditions is essential in knowing what minerals can be formed from these base parts.  Mineral composition  The surface geology of Mars is somewhere between the basalt or andesite rocks on Earth. This led to the formation of minerals similar to what is found on Earth. The presence of iron oxide gives the surface the “rust” color that is associated with Mars, the Red Planet. The presence of perchlorate, in high percentages, forms highly saline soils, which could produce liquid water.Head, J.W., Marchant, D.R., and Kreslavsky, M.A., 2008, Formation of gullies on Mars: Link to recent climate history and insulation microenvironments implicate surface water flow origin: PNAS, vol. 105, p. 13258-13263 Chemical alteration of Martian rocks into carbonate and phyllosilicate minerals occurred earlier in Mars history when water was present in large quantities.Mustard, J.F., Pelkey, S.M., Ehlmann, B.L., Roach, L., et. al, 2008, Hydrated silicate minerals on Mars observed by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter CRISM instrument: Nature, Vol. 454, p. 305-309.

This data is used to determine possible minerals on the surface, and the types of instruments Landers would need in order to narrow down those minerals. Mars Global Surveyor Launched in 1996, it used the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC), Mars Orbital Laser Altimeter, and Thermal Emission Spectrometer to show layering on the surface, presence of surface ice, and the mineral hematite. The presence of ice over the surface is essential to understanding why certain water bearing minerals are on Mars. Mars Odyssey Launched in 2001, although it carried multiple instruments only Thermal Emission Imaging System was designed to look at minerals. This allowed it to detect the presence of quartz, olivine, and hematite. Mars Express Launched in 2003 the Visible and Infrared Mineralogical Mapping Spectrometer (OMEGA) observed montmorillonite and localized phyllosilicate minerals. Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Launched in 2005 this orbiter carried multiple instruments which found the mineralogy to be dominated by mafic minerals such as olivine, mica, pyroxene and smectite clays such as kaolinite. The HiRISE was used in determining the landing site for the Phoenix Lander. Using the CTX (camera) and CRISM instruments it was able to find phyllosilicate minerals, carbonate minerals, and oxides. The SHARAD was used to detect carbonate dust layers.Byrne, S., 2009, The Polar Deposits of Mars: Annual Review Earth Planet Science, vol. 37 p.535-560.  Landers  To date, mankind's only way of carrying out experiments on the Martian surface has been to send probes to it. The successful missions are able to carry out experiments that directly observe the composition of Martian soil and rocks. They are the key to verifying our observations of minerals, although currently they are limited to the uppermost area of the surface. Mars Pathfinder Mars Exploration Rover Mission Launched in 2003 it contained two separate rovers the Spirit rover and the Opportunity rover. Spirit One of its instruments the Mössbauer spectrometer (MIMOS II) was designed to look at the iron bearing minerals on mars. It is responsible for determining the presence of many specific iron oxides, which give the planet a red color.Morris, R.V., et al., 2004, Mineralogy at Gusev Crater from the Mossbauer Spectrometer on the Spirit Rover: Science, vol. 305, p.833 Opportunity Using the Mini-TES it was able to detect the presence of some calcium and magnesium rich sulfate minerals. It also found feldspar, jarosite, pigeonite, clinopyroxene, and maskelynite along with detecting the presence of minerals found by the orbiters and other rovers.Christensen, P.R., et al., 2004, Mineralogy at Meridiani Planum from the Mini-TES Experiment on the Opportunity Rover: Science, vol. 306, p. 1733 Phoenix Lander Most noted for landing in a polar region, it carries the WCL (Wet Chemistry Laboratory), which is a part of the MECA (Microscopy, Electrochemistry, and Conductivity Analyzer) instrument suite. It is responsible for identifying perchlorate salts, and various cations such as magnesium, sodium, calcium, and potassium. Along with TEGA it showed the presence of calcium carbonate, and minute traces of methane. Due to the analytical limits of MECA, the Phoenix was unable to determine the sulfur- based minerals detected by the Opportunity.Goetz, W., 2010, Phoenix on Mars: American Scientist, vol. 98, p. 40-47  References  Mars Category:Geology of Mars Category:Planetary science ","title":"Mineralogy of Mars"},{"id":"26673265","text":"Yutta Barding (26 December 1880 - 12 March 1976) was a Danish fencer.

Normal Route The Normal Route is the easiest, safest and fastest on account of the cable car and chairlift system which operates from about 9am till 3pm. Starting for the summit at about 2am from the Diesel Hut should allow just enough time to get back down to the chairlift if movement is efficient. In bad weather the chairlift section may be closed, also note the chairlift ride is 15-minutes long and can be very cold. The majority of groups take the cable car system from Azau roadhead to Mir Station from where either a one-hour walk or a chairlift takes them to Garabashi – \\"The Barrels\\" or to Leaprus hut – also called \\"The crashed UFO\\". Above it may be possible to hire a snowcat to go to the Diesel Hut (site of the burnt \\"Priut 11\\" Hut) or higher to Pastukhova Rocks. Walking this takes 90 minutes to the hut and almost two hours more to the rocks. The walk to the Saddle takes another three to four hours and from there to the summit, a further 90 minutes should be allowed for. There are no major difficulties on the route, however after strong winds icy sections may be exposed and a fall could result in a slide. Particular care should be taken on the traversing ascent from the Saddle. The Saddle hut is a ruin that offers no shelter. There are few crevasses of any size or danger if one sticks to the route, but straying only 50m off the route could lead the climber into dangerous terrain. Details:Description, diagram and map of Normal Route Sample Itinerary # Fly to Mineralnye Vody. Private bus transfer to base hotel in Baksan Valley. # Acclimatization walk from hotel. # Ascend cable car system to Garabashi Huts or Leaprus hut . Possible acclimatisation walk to Pastukhova Rocks. # Acclimatisation walk to Pastukhova Rocks. Possible attempt on summit if very well acclimatised on arrival. # Attempt on Elbrus. # Another possible attempt on Elbrus. # Descend to hotel in the Baksan Valley. # Drive back to Mineralnye Vody for return flights.Short Elbrus sample itinerary Kiukurtliu Route A longer ascent route starts from below the cable-way Mir station and heads west over glacier slopes towards the Khotiutau pass. Some distance before reaching this the south spur of the Kiukurtliu Cupola is climbed to a broad glaciated saddle behind pt.4912 (top of the SW spur). Now a rising traverse north is made to attain the easy northwest spur by which the summit is gained. This expedition involves three nights' camping–bivouacs; parties also need a rope, axe and crampons.Kiukurtliu route details Other Routes Climbing Elbrus from other directions is a tougher proposition because of lack of permanent high facilities. Douglas Freshfield always maintained that a route from the east up the Iryk valley, Irykchat glacier and over the Irykchat pass (3667m) on to snowfields below long rock ribs of the east spur would become the shortest and most used approach. A hut built long ago on the north side of the lrykchat pass is now wrecked. In addition, the high elevation change calls for at least two camp-bivouacs.Other route details and map Permits Three are required:Elbrus permits # Border Zone Permit. Foreigners require a permit to be in any area south of the Baksan. This is obtained at the military head office of the border rangers in Nalchik. Climbers should also be registered at their local posts: in the Baksan valley at the Alpine Base Baksan; in the Adyrsu valley near the Alpine Camp Ullutau. Pogranotryad in Nalchik issues permits at 192 Kabardinskaya street.

The Security Council recalled the importance of the General Peace Agreement (Rome General Peace Accords) for Mozambique and its timely implementation. Progress was welcomed in the country, particularly the announcement that elections would take place on 27 and 28 October, but concern was also expressed at the delay in implementing some parts of the agreements. The Council welcomed the observance of the ceasefire, the beginning of demobilisation, transfer of arms to regional depots, the arrival of the high command and the beginning of training for the new army. The deployment of United Nations police observers was welcomed and all parties were called upon to cooperate with them, and allow ONUMOZ and the police unfettered access to the areas under their control, and to permit free political activity. The announcement of election dates and establishment of an election commission and its provincial officies was welcomed by the Council. Concern was expressed at delays in the implementation of parts of the Accords with regards to demobilisation and the formation of the Mozambican Defense Forces. The President of Mozambique and RENAMO had agreed to accelerate the process. On 1 June, the forces were to be assembled and on 15 July the process of the demobilisation was to be completed. In this regard, the Council underlined the need for ONUMOZ to be fully informed of the process, have access to military bases and ensure that as many troops were trained before the elections as possible. Demining was also important for the Council, which welcomed the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's intention to accelerate the process. There was also an appeal to the international community in the resolution, calling for financial, technical and humanitarian assistance, while the resettling of refugees and displaced persons was praised. After extending ONUMOZ's mandate, it noted it would be reviewed by 15 July 1994, based on a report by the Secretary-General.

The first phase, costing $1.1 billion, was being paid for by hospitality taxes. The second phase, called RIDE II, was being paid for through a one-cent sales tax approved by Horry County voters November 7, 2006.Tritten, Travis, \\"1-penny road tax debated: Council puts RIDE funds back on table,\\" The Sun News, June 21, 2006.Tritten, Travis, \\"Horry readies RIDE 2: Finances, schedule must be settled,\\" The Sun News, December 17, 2006.Tritten, Travis, \\"RIDE 2 moves to review after 2nd phase released,\\" The Sun News, April 26, 2006. RIDE III was being planned as of 2013 and voters approved a penny tax in 2016. History In 1996, South Carolina voters turned down a one-cent sales tax for roads, and Buck Limehouse, the state's first DOT Commission chairman, started the State Infrastructure Bank. Commission member Gary Loftus became the first chairman of RIDE, which came up with the list of Horry County projects to use money from the bank. In the years 1995 through 2002, the state completed 27 years worth of road projects at a cost of $5 billion, including the RIDE projects.Wilson, Zane, \\"Officials cheer new DOT director,\\" The Sun News, May 3, 2007. The Fantasy Harbour Bridge, opened in July 2009, was the last RIDE project. A 2.5 percent accommodations tax, and a 1.5 percent prepared foods tax, funds projects in the first phase of RIDE. Three-fifths of the tax goes to RIDE projects, with the remainder for public safety, public works and infrastructure relating to tourism. On May 2, 2017, the Horry County Council voted to continue collecting the 1.5 percent hospitality fee first passed in 1996 and scheduled to end in 2019. Supporters of keeping the fee wanted to use revenues for Interstate 73. The Horry County Council created the RIDE II Committee on April 17, 2001. It included 11 voting members plus the chairman of the S.C. DOT. The committee's purpose is to advise the county and state of road needs, study funding methods, and review projects under construction. The original list of projects included the northern section of Carolina Bays Parkway but did not provide funding for the southern section.\\"Building Stopped: Horry council acts boldly to protect parkway path,\\" The Sun News, March 19, 2007. The first list for RIDE 2 released in April 2006, included 10 projects. After the approval of a one-cent sales tax on November 7, 2006, the list included 15 projects totalling $425 million. The biggest of these were an interchange on U.S. Highway 17 next to the former Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, the widening of S.C. 707, and a bypass for Aynor. Also included was the paving of International Drive from Robert Grissom Parkway to S.C. 90, providing an alternate route to Carolina Forest.\\"It's Our Road, Not DNR's,\\" The Sun News, December 16, 2007. The One-Cent Capital Projects Sales Tax began on May 1, 2007 intended to last up to seven years, generating $425,307,500; if the tax produced that amount before the seven years end, it was to be dropped. On November 7, 2011, Myrtle Beach city council member Wayne Gray asked area elected officials to consider using RIDE funds to pay for a portion of I-73. One possibility was to continue the RIDE I tax past 2023. Nine of 15 RIDE II projects were under way or finished as a groundbreaking was held November 6, 2013 for the final section of Carolina Bays Parkway and the S.C. 707 widening. Collection of the tax ended April 30, 2014, but RIDE III was already being planned. In March 2016, the RIDE III Sales Tax Commission completed a list of 20 projects to be funded by another one-cent tax. The projects on the list totalled $592 million. The Horry County Council voted June 8 to let voters decide on the sales tax in November 2016, which they did. Collection of the tax began May 1, 2017, and surplus funds from RIDE II will also be used.

She studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris from 1960 to 1965 and was a member of the 1970s Body Art movement in France, called \\"Art corporel\\". Parallel to her art, Pane taught at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Mans from 1975 to 1990 and ran an atelier dedicated to performance art at the Centre Pompidou from 1978 to 1979 at the request of Pontus Hulten. Pane is possibly best known for her performance piece The Conditioning (1973), in which she is laid on a metal bedframe over an area of burning candles. The Conditioning was recreated by Marina Abramović as part of her Seven Easy Pieces (2005) at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York in 2005. Gina Pane's estate is managed by her former partner Anne Marchand. She is represented by Galerie Kamel Mennour in Paris. Biography Born in Biarritz to Italian parents, Pane spent part of her early life in Italy. She returned to France to study under André Chastel at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris from 1960–1965. She died prematurely in 1990 following a long illness. Extreme self-inflicted injury featured in much of Pane's performance work, distinguishing her from most other female body artists of the 1970s. Through the violence of cutting her skin with razor blades or putting out fires with her bare hands and feet, Pane intended to incite a \\"real experience\\" in the viewer, who would be moved to empathize with her discomfort. The shocking nature of these early performances — or \\"actions,\\" as she preferred to call them — often overshadowed her prolific photographic and sculptural practice. However, the body was a central concern in all of Pane's work, whether literally or conceptually.Delia Gaze, Dictionary of Women Artists, vol. 2 (USA: Fitzroy Dearborn, 1997), 1064 Pane claimed that she was greatly influenced by political protests in Paris in May 1968, and by such international conflicts as the Vietnam War (Ferrer 1989, pp. 37–8). In Nourriture-actualités télévisées-feu (1971; repr. Pluchart 1971) she force-fed herself and spat back up 600 grammes of raw ground meat, watched the nightly news on television as she stared past a nearly blinding light bulb, and extinguished flames with her bare hands and feet. After the performance, she said, people reported a heightened sensitivity. \\"Everyone there remarked: 'It's strange, we never felt or heard the news before. There's actually a war going on in Vietnam, unemployment everywhere.'\\" (Stephano 1973, p. 22) Work From 1962-1967 Pane produced geometric abstraction and created a number of metal sculptures by bending sheets of metal into simple shapes, the structures and her use of primary colors being reminiscent of minimal art. From her academic training, however, Pane developed an interest in the human body and turned to making sculpture and installation. This work considered the relationship between the body and nature. In 1968, Pane began making minutely prepared and documented actions in which each gesture was imbued with a ritual dimension. Pane distinguishes three periods of her artistic evolution: • 1968-1971: Placing the body in nature. Works include Displaced Stones (1968), Protected Earth (1968-1970), and Enfoncement d'un rayon de soleil (1969). In Unanaestheticized Climb (1971) she climbed, barefoot, a ladder with rungs studded with sharp metal protrusions, stopping when she could not longer endure the pain. • 1970-late 1970s: The active body in public. Pane considered space and time to be the material for these works. All that remains of these works are photographic documentation of carefully chosen moments and the performative object. These actions constitute a research into another language. They seek to transform the individual through willed communication with the Other. This work rejects aestheticism in order to produce a new image of beauty. In 1973 at the Galerie Diagramma in Milan, Pane executed Sentimental Action before an audience, the first row of which was exclusively female. Pane twice repeated an action twice, the first time with a bouquet of red roses, and the second time with a bouquet of white roses. Passing progressively from standing to the fetal position, she executed first a back- and-forth movement with the bouquet, before pressing the thorns of a rose into her arms and making an incision with a razor blade on the palm of her hand. The form of the wounds on her arm resembled the petals and stem of a rose. She described this work as a ‘projection of an intra space’ that dealt with the mother–child relationship. • Late 1970s-onward: Relationship of the body to the world. For the installation series Action Notation she mixed photographs of her previous wounds with objects, such as toys, glass, etc., from her previous actions. The process was controversial since it almost always involved an element of masochism: climbing up a ladder studded with razor blades, cutting her tongue or her ear, sticking nails into her forearm, smashing through a glass door, ingesting food to the point of nausea. Pane no longer based her approach on direct bodily experience, although the body remained pivotal and retained its symbolic significance through figures (cross, rectangle, circle) and materials (burnt or rusty metal, glass or copper).

These include differentiation, integration, advanced trigonometry, binomial expansion, surds, indices and plane geometry. GCSE Additional Mathematics in Northern Ireland In Northern Ireland, Additional Mathematics was offered as a GCSE subject by the local examination board, CCEA. There were two examination papers: one which tested topics in Pure Mathematics, and one which tested topics in Mechanics and Statistics. It was discontinued in 2014 and replaced with GCSE Further Mathematics—a new qualification whose level exceeds both those offered by GCSE Mathematics, and the analogous qualifications offered in England. Further Maths IGCSE and Additional Maths FSMQ in England Starting from 2012, Edexcel and AQA have started a new course which is an IGCSE in Further Maths. Edexcel and AQA both offer completely different courses, with Edexcel including the calculation of solids formed through integration, and AQA not including integration. AQA's syllabus mainly offers further algebra, with the factor theorem and the more complex algebra such as algebraic fractions. It also offers differentiation up to—and including—the calculation of normals to a curve. AQA's syllabus also includes a wide selection of matrices work, which is an AS Further Mathematics topic. AQA's syllabus is much more famous than Edexcel's, mainly for its controversial decision to award an A* with Distinction (A^), a grade higher than the maximum possible grade in any Level 2 qualification; it is known colloquially as a Super A* or A. A new Additional Maths course from 2018 is OCR Level 3 FSMQ: Additional Maths (6993). In addition to algebra, coordinate geometry, Pythagorean theorem, trigonometry and calculus, which were on the previous specification, this course also includes: * 'Enumeration' content, which expands the topic of the binomial distribution to include permutations and combinations * 'Numerical methods’ content, which expands upon the informal graphical approximations in GCSE * 'Exponentials and Logarithms’ content, which develops the growth and decay content and the graphs section of GCSE * 'Sequences' content, which uses subscript notation to support the iterative work on numerical methods. Additional Mathematics in Malaysia In Malaysia, Additional Mathematics is offered as an elective to upper secondary students within the public education system. This subject is included in the Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia examination. Science stream students are required to apply for Additional Mathematics as one of the subjects in the Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia examination, while Additional Mathematics is an optional subject for students who are from arts or commerce streams. Additional Mathematics in Malaysia—also commonly known as Add Maths—can be organized into two learning packages: the Core Package, which includes geometry, algebra, calculus, trigonometry and statistics, and the Elective Package, which includes science and technology application and social science application. It covers various topics including functions, quadratic equations, quadratic functions, simultaneous equations, indices, logarithms, coordinate geometry, statistics, circular measure, differentiation, solution of triangles, and index numbers in Form 4, for a total of 11 chapters and progressions, linear law, integration, vectors, trigonometric functions, permutations, combinations, probability, probability distributions, motion along a straight line, and linear programming in Form 5, for a total of 10 chapters. Format for Additional Mathematics Exam based on the Malaysia Certificate of Education is as follows: * Paper 1 (Duration: 2 Hours): A total of 25 questions tested based on the student's knowledge to grasp the concepts and formulae learned during their 2 years of learning. Each question may contain from zero to three subsets of questions with marks ranging from 2 to 5 marks. The total weighting of the paper is 80 marks and constitutes 44% of the grade. * Paper 2 (Duration: 2 hours 30 minutes): Questions are categorised into 3 sections: A, B and C. Section A contains 6 questions which must all be answered. Section B contains 5 questions where students are given the choice to answer 4 out of 5 of them. Section C contains 4 questions where students are only required to answer 2 out of 4 of the given questions. All Section C questions are based on the same chapters every year and are thus predictable. A question in Section C carries 10 marks with at least 4 subquestions per question. This paper tests the student's ability to apply various concepts and formulae in real-life situations. The total weighting of the paper is 100 marks and constitutes 56% of the grade. In 2020, the first batch of students learning the new syllabus, KSSM, will receive new Form 4 textbooks with new chapters which contain certain topics from A-levels. Additional Mathematics in Mauritius In Mauritius, Additional Mathematics, more commonly referred to as Add Maths, is offered in secondary school as an optional subject in the Arts Streams, and a compulsory subject in the Science, Technical and Economics Stream. This subject is included in the University of Cambridge International Examinations, with covered topics including functions, quadratic equations, differentiation and integration (calculus). Additional Mathematics in Hong Kong In Hong Kong, the syllabus of HKCEE additional mathematics covered three main topics, algebra, calculus and analytic geometry. In algebra, the topics covered include mathematical induction, binomial theorem, quadratic equations, trigonometry, inequalities, 2D-vectors and complex number, whereas in calculus, the topics covered include limit, differentiation and integration.

It was translated into French at the University of Tokyo and published by Editions Le Sycomore as Zone de vide, and subsequently translated into English by Bernard Frechtman and published in the United States in 1956. Plot The action takes place in Japan in late 1944, in a Japanese Army infantry barracks. The protagonists are two soldiers, Kitani and Soda. Kitani has spent two years in a military penitentiary for a crime he has not committed, the theft of an officer's wallet. He is actually the victim of the struggle between two cliques in the regiment he belonged to. Soda is an honest and sensitive young man who would like to be Kitani's friend and strives to reconstruct his story. The novel is told in the third person, but with two strong narrative foci on the two protagonists. Noma's novel is a denunciation of the corruption of the Japanese army during World War II, and it aims at providing \\"the readers with a true picture of what [Noma's] country was like when it was under the yoke of [militarism]\\" (from the author's preface). However, the depiction of the humiliating conditions in which Japanese soldiers were kept during the Second World War is not Noma's only purpose in writing Zone of Emptiness, as he \\"tried to describe not only the Japanese army but also what is universal in the Japanese soul\\". A painstaking psychological analysis of the characters is in fact another important component of the novel, where the gradual unveiling of Soda's and Kitani's past allows readers to understand the motivations of their behaviour and actions.

She is best known for her sweetgrass basket weaving using traditional methods combined with contemporary designs. A native of coastal South Carolina and a descendant of generations of Gullah basket weavers, Jackson was awarded a MacArthur Foundation fellowship in 2008 for \\"pushing the tradition in stunning new directions.\\" Biography Jackson was born on February 15, 1945. She grew up in the Gullah community of Mount Pleasant, just outside of Charleston, South Carolina. Taught by her mother and grandmother, Jackson started making sweetgrass baskets at the age of four. The tradition and technique of sweetgrass basket weaving has been passed down from one generation to the next, originating with the West African slaves who were brought to coastal South Carolina in the early 1700s. During her childhood, Jackson, along with her siblings and cousins would gather in her grandmother's yard to help weave baskets. After graduating from high school, Jackson moved to New York City, where she attended secretarial school and went on to work for the Metropolitan Insurance Company. Jackson lived in New York for ten years. While in New York city, she would visit museums and art galleries and started to collect contemporary paintings and sculptures. Jackson returned to South Carolina in 1972 and continued to work as a secretary. Jackson learned from family and friends that the sweetgrass used in basketmaking was starting to disappear. Through her work at the Charleston Community Center, she was able to get permission from local landowners to allow the harvesting of sweetgrass by local basketmakers on land waiting to be developed. In the 1970s, Jackson had to stop working to stay home with her eighteen-month-old son who suffered from chronic asthma. While at home, she started to work on baskets again and would sell her baskets at the city market in Charleston. During this time, Jackson started to create her own designs. Using sweetgrass, palmetto, pine needles, and bulrush in her work, Jackson's finely crafted and innovative baskets started to attract attention. She was invited to exhibit her baskets at the Smithsonian Craft Show in 1984. That event became a turning point in Jackson's career. Jackson is the recipient of numerous awards, including the prestigious MacArthur genius grant in 2008. Her baskets have been exhibited at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, The White House Collection of American Crafts, the Museum of Arts and Design in New York, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the Museum of African American History in Detroit, and the National Museum of African American History and Culture. As founding president of the Mount Pleasant Sweetgrass Basket Makers Association, Jackson continues to work with local basketmakers, government officials, preservationists, and horticulturalists in salvaging grasses from sites planned for development and replanting them on protected lands. Jackson is currently living in Charleston with her husband, Stoney. She is still making Sweetgrass baskets that come out of a tradition that has been passed down from her ancestors. These baskets originated in West Africa, and brought to America by slaves.

It was published by Skyhorse Publishing in 2010. Overview The book presents and discusses conspiracy theories related to several notable events in the history of the United States. Ventura argues that events such as the assassinations of former U.S. Presidents Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy, the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X and Robert F. Kennedy, the Watergate scandal, the Jonestown Massacre, the elections of former U.S. President George W. Bush, and the financial crisis of 2007–2010 need to be more thoroughly investigated, and discusses an alleged cover-up of events and information related to the September 11 attacks. Ventura cites physical evidence for some of these claims, and invokes eyewitness testimony as well. Much of the book is based on government documents and stories from the back pages of mainstream American media, such as the New York Times, Newsweek and the Washington Post. The book finds common threads tying together the two Kennedy Assassinations, the Watergate burglary, Iran/Contra and even 9/11. Some of the same actors are implicated in all these events. None of these events led to an investigation by local police, as is required by law. No criminal trials were conducted in any of these cases, that might have led to investigation with subpoena power. In the book, which is in part based on the TV series Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura, Ventura also claims that a CIA operative worked in Minnesota government during his administration, that he was interviewed by a large group of CIA agents about his successful independent campaign for governor of Minnesota, and that the CIA used double agents that deliberately let themselves get caught at the Watergate complex to bring former U.S. President Richard Nixon down. In the week of March 21, American Conspiracies was listed on place 8 of the Hardcover Nonfiction section of Publishers Weekly, and on place 7 of the section in the following week. Topics mentioned in the book =Assassination of John F. Kennedy= In the home movie fortuitously recorded by Abraham Zapruder, Kennedy's head jerks backward, indicating that he had been hit from the front. But the warehouse from which Lee Harvey Oswald was supposed to have shot the president was behind Kennedy's back. There was only time for one shot to be fired by Oswald, but there were bullet holes in Kennedy's shoulder as well as his head, and Governor Connally, sitting next to the President, was struck as well. Doctors who performed the original autopsy say that their reports were altered. =Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy= Sirhan Sirhan shot RFK in the stomach at point blank range. Coroners reported that the bullet that killed him was fired into the back of his head. The gun which Sirhan used held 8 bullets that could have been fired in quick succession. Audio recordings of the event can distinguish the sound of at least 9 gunshots, and one thorough analysis claims 13 shots in 5 seconds. =Election Theft= Ventura reveals that a White House computer consultant named Michael Connell was responsible for computerized vote theft in Florida in 2000 and for \\"disappearing\\" millions of White House emails that had been subpoenaed by Congress. In 2004, Connell was hired by Ohio Secretary of State J Kenneth Blackwell (who simultaneously co-chaired the Bush re-election campaign in Ohio) to design a computer system for tabulating Ohio county votes that could be accessed from outside. At midnight on Election Night, 2004, the official Secretary of State web site for reporting vote counts in Ohio went black, and when the site came back on-line two hours later, it was no longer housed in Columbus, but (invisibly) at the Chattanooga, TN headquarters of Gov-Tech Solutions, the private White House consultant. This story was slowly revealed during the aftermath of the 2004 election, and Connell was finally subpoenaed for a deposition about his role in computerized vote theft, when he died suddenly in a private plane crash that was declared an accident by Federal authorities, and was never investigated. =9/11= The Twin Towers fell straight down in sudden collapse at speeds so fast that their bottom sections must have started to fall at the same time as the tops. Physicists claim that the buildings could not have fallen in this way because of airplane impact and fires alone, and that they must have been carefully prepared in advance of 9/11. Before 9/11 and since, no steel-framed building has ever collapsed because of a fire, and many have suffered much longer and hotter fires than those in the Twin Towers. People inside the Towers reported the sound of explosions at ground level before the planes struck. Traces of a military-grade explosive, capable of melting steel, were detected in the dust collected in nearby buildings. There were no identifiable pieces of a Boeing 757 outside the Pentagon where it was struck, and no holes or marks on the wall where wings and heavy engines should have done considerable damage. The flight maneuver that the plane would have had to execute in order to strike the Pentagon where it did was all but impossible, even for an expert pilot, because it required the plane to drop very steeply while executing a 330 degree turn, then level off closer to the ground than the plane is designed to fly. Early reports of the impact said that the Pentagon had been hit by a missile. The Pentagon has surveillance films of the plane (or missile), which it refuses to release. According to official reports, no black boxes were recovered from any of the four hijacked airplanes. But airliner black boxes are designed to survive any conceivable crash, and are almost invariably located because they continue to report their whereabouts with a radio signal.

Calculated Industries was incorporated in California in early 1978. The ownership changed that same year, when two brothers, Fred and Ken Alexander, took control. In 1994, the company relocated from Southern California to Carson City, Nevada. History Calculated Industries' first entry into the calculator business came in the later 1970s with The Loan Arranger. It was one of the first Real Estate calculators to simplify the process of calculating a loan payment, breaking away from the traditional financial key labeling of “I”, “PV”, “FV” to more clearly labeled function keys. It also predated the well-known HP12c financial calculator. With the success of The Loan Arranger the Alexander brothers tried a few other specialty calculators such as the GradeMatic calculator which helped teachers compute student grades, and the Graphic Arts Master. However, the real success of the company came in 1985 with the creation of the Construction Master. According to Mark Bollman, a mathematics and calculator historian and associate professor of mathematics at Albion College, the \\"Construction Master is the first in a long and profitable line of CI construction calculators\\". The Construction Master came preprogrammed with common construction calculations, and was a significant move forward for those dealing with construction math (such as angles, stairs, roofing math, pitch, rise, run, etc.). Fine Homebuilding magazine described the calculator as a noteworthy contribution to those in the construction field in an article based on the 25 Years of Milestones that help shape the homebuilding industry.http://www.finehomebuilding.com/PDF/Free/021177078.pdf The success of the Construction Master calculator gave the company drive to focus on more construction-related products and has since produced related calculators such as the ElectriCalc, Material Estimator, Heavy Calc, Project Calc, and most recently a Pipe Trades calculator. While their core business is now mainly focused on the construction industry, CI has developed other specialty products such as a kitchen calculator, a Quilters' calculator (the FabriCalc), and the Time Master, as well as developing a series of cost-effective digital devices to measure blueprint takeoffs. As of 2010, the company is still developing specialty calculators and won runner-up at the SEMA show for best new product of 2010 for a new Hot Rod Calc which assists with engine modification math.

More rarely, finely chopped onions are added. The cooked ingredients are minced after the juices have been poured off and a crumbly cake is left which is held together with fat and which sets on cooling. There are various recipes, but they all contain barley groats, fat and meat. A classic recipe contains pig offal or heart, belly pork with rind, lard greaves, barley groats, water, salt, pepper, allspice and thyme.Dr. Oetker Schulkochbuch, p. 94 Ceres-Verlag Originalnachdruck von 1960 The nutrition varies; one portion made from about 300 g of pork and 60 g of groats contains about 850 kJ.Dr. Oetker, Kochen von A-Z, p. 502, Dr. Oetker Verlag KG, Bielefeld 2004 Its relatively high fat content means that Stippgrütze keeps well and is often preserved or frozen, so that it can be used over the winter. The season for Stippgrütze begins with the traditional Schlachtfest or country feast in October or November, when the pigs are slaughtered, and lasts until spring. In the shops Stippgrütze is usually sold in sausage form in clear artificial casings about 12 cm in diameter. To prepare it a large piece is fried in a pan without any additional fat, until a firm crust forms on the underside, occasionally it is stirred and fried again. A sort of porridge or puree (Brei) results, hence its other name of Wurstebrei (sausage puree). Stippgrütze is served hot out of the pan and usually consumed at dinner (evening meal) together with or on top of coarse rye bread. For a main meal around midday salt or roast potatoes are usually served with it. It is common for Stippgrütze to include a pickled gherkin. Its acidity supports the digestion and palatability of this fatty meal. Due to its high fat content Stippgrütze is also commonly eaten before enjoying alcoholic drinks. The use of cooked offal together with coarsely-ground cereal exists in many cultures and used to be viewed as 'poor man's food'. Examples include the Scottish haggis prepared in a very similar way from oats and sheep's innards or the Swedish dish, Pölsa.

Alphonse Delannoy, editor in 1842 of the chess periodical Le Palamède, wrote that \\"He was a clever fellow, sharp, gay, lively,amusing, and had studied seriously the theory of chess, by which he made his living. His talent redeemed a little the rudeness of his manner and a certain licentiousness which he indulged in. He used to be in a continual state of semi-intoxication\\", and George Walker wrote that \\"His brain was consumed in the Brandy\\".G.

Mouret (1836) appeared which is often attributed to Mouret on the basis of the preface, but it seems that he was only the \\"corrector\\" as evidenced by an advertisement found in a newspaper after his death.The Hansard, December 27, 1837 He ended his life in a state of severe physical and mental deterioration, without a penny to his name. Early in 1837 Le Palamède published an invitation to help the old chess master,Le Palamède edited by St. Amaint (1837) p. 45 but with the following issue the journal published his obituary. The members of the Chess Club of Paris took charge of his funeral expenses. Mouret and The Turk Mouret is best known as a hidden operator of Automaton Chess Player known as The Turk, a fake chess-playing machine constructed in the late 18th century and traveled around Europe in the early 19th century. The Automaton, manufactured by Kempelen was shown for the first time to the Austrian court in 1769. After the death of Kempelen in 1805 it came in possession of the German engineer Johann Maelzel who exploited first in Europe and then from 1826 in the USA. Mouret was one of many strong players who played hidden in the Turk (others being Johann Baptist Allgaier, who defeated Napoleon in 1809, Schlumberger, Boncourt and Lewis).G. Walker, Chess and chess-players (1850) p. 55 Fifty games of the Turk during his exhibition in London in 1819, while the machine was operated by Mouret, are collected in a book published in 1820.W. Hunnemann, A selection of 50 games played by the automaton chess player (1820) The preface states that to February 1820 (date of publication of the book), The Turk had played about 300 games giving the advantage of pawn and move to his opponents and he only has ever lost six. Mouret's weakness for drinking often left him penniless and, to survive, he probably revealed in 1834 to Le Magasin picturesqueLe Magasin picturesque edited by E. Charton, (1834) p. 155 the secret of the Turk. The article, titled An attempt to analyze the automaton chess-player of M. Kempelen, explained how an ordinary-sized man could play a chess game inside the Turk. It was published anonymously, but many references (e.g. Walker) indicate Mouret as the source. The French master was sick and short of money at the time, and died penniless three years later. \\"Inventor\\" of the French Defense? Mouret cannot be considered the inventor of the response 1...e6 to 1.e4, today known as French Defense, which had appeared in early manuscripts of the game like those of Gioacchino Greco (published for the first time in London by Herry Herringman in 1656 under the title: The Royall Game of Chesse- Play). Mouret, however, advocated and frequently played this defense,Westminster papers edited by the Westminster Chess Club (1874) p. 25 very little used at the time, and he played a fundamental role in the events that led to its being named the French Defense. Mouret, in fact, taught the defense to a frequent player of Café de la Régence, Mr. Chamouillet, in exchange for a piece of advice about the purchase of a mirror (as Chamouillet was a glazier).Le Palamède edited by St. Amaint (1846) p. 20 In 1834 Chamouillet was in the committee of Paris at the famous game by correspondence between London and Paris, and he convinced the Paris team to adopt the defense advocated by Mouret (the game can be seen at chessgames.com). Following the victory of the French team, the opening quickly became known as the French Defense, in answer to 1.e4 as popular as 1 ... e5.Papers of the Exchequer French - Marcel Lamarre article under the pseudonym: An Amateur Ex UAAR (3rd Book 1925) p75-76 Anecdotes Because of his chronic shortage of money and dependence on alcohol, a variety of stories came out around the character of Mouret. We present here a few that give us a portrait of both Mouret and the chess-life of the time. The first story concerns the period when Mouret was the hidden operator of The Turk. Initially, Maelzel (the owner of the Turk) and Mouret went on in perfect harmony. After a certain time, however, Maelzel remained debtor to his assistant for a considerable sum and after a year he still had not paid this debt to Mouret. One day, when the Automaton was in Amsterdam, invited by the King of Holland, Maelzel found Mouret in bed seized with a convulsive trembling. Maelzel was worried since the day after they had to meet the King and asked \\"Is there no means of subduing this fever?\\". \\"Yes, one only\\". \\"What is it?\\". \\"To pay me the 1500 francs you owe me\\". Maelzel paid his debts and the cure was wonderful; the Automaton played better than ever.C. Tomlinson, Amusements in chess (1845) p. 110 The second anecdote (too long to be reported here), concerns a \\"scam\\" organized by Mouret and De Labourdonnais against a wealthy but miser habitué of the Café de la Régence.Brentano's Monthly, Article of Alphonse Delannoy (1881) p. 317 The complete text of this story can be found on Google Books. Style of play and games Of Mouret's playing style, Le Palamède stated: > Son jeu était très correct et d'une très grande force, principalement sous > le rapport de la défense. (\\"His game was very correct and of tremendous > strength, especially in respect to the defense.\\") The large majority of Mouret's surviving games are those played by the Turk and collected by Hunnemann. In these games, according to Walker: > \\"Mouret shows a strong and effective style... These games contain a fair > specimen of Mouret's great skill, and embody some beautiful emanations of > genius. Throughout the whole, he gives the pawn and move, numbering among > his opponents Messrs. Brand, Cochrane, Keen, and Mercier, some of the first > chess-players of the time.\\" The analysis of those games, however, reveals that the large majority of them were won by Mouret on the basis of simple tactical mistakes or even blunders by his opponents (also those called by Walker \\"some of the first chess-players of the time\\"). The following game is a typical example. Brandreth - Chess Automaton (Mouret) London 1819 (remove black's pawn in f7) 1\\\\. e4 e6 2. d4 g6 3. Nf3 d5 4. e5 c5 5. c3 Nc6 6. Bb5 Qb6 7. Bxc6+ bxc6 8. O-O cxd4 9. cxd4 c5 10. Nc3 cxd4 11. Nxd4 Bd7 12. Qd3 a6 13. Rb1 Bg7 14. f4 Nh6 15. Kh1 O-O 16. h3 Qd8 17. Nb3 Nf5 18. Ne2? Bb5 19. Qd1 Bxe2 0-1 Analysis assisted by the chess engine Firebird 1.2 shows that White could have played much better at his 12th move with 12. Nxd5 exd5 13.e6 and if 13... Bc6 14. Nxc6 Qxc6 15. Qd4. Mouret seems to have a “blind spot” for this tactical pattern (sacrifice in d5 followed by e5-e6), which could have occurred in various games played by the Turk. One example is only Mouret's loss against Cochrane (the overall score was +3 =1 -1 in favour of Mouret) and available on chessgames.com. In the majority of cases, however, Mouret's opponent did not take advantage of this possibility. In Diagram 1, for instance, the position of another game Cochrane – Mouret, London 1819, after Black's 15th move is reported. White played 16. a3 and the game ended in a draw, but he could have gained a better position after 16. Nxd5 exd5 17. e6 (FireBird 1.2). The most remarkable aspect of these games, however, is Mouret's treatment of the pawn structure similar to that derived from today's Advance Variation of the French Defence, which the Automaton approached in a fashion very close to the modern standards.N. McDonald and A. Harley, Mastering the French, Batsford (1997) Ch. 1 A good example can be found in the following example. Cochrane - Chess Automaton (Mouret) London 1819 (remove black's pawn in f7) 1\\\\. e4 e6 2. d4 c6 3. f4 d5 4. e5 c5 5. c3 Nc6 6. Bb5 Today, this plan is known to be inaccurate,D. Heisman, The Most Common Opening Inaccuracies (retrieved March 2010) p. 7 but it was played frequently by the Automaton opponents 6...Qb6 7. Bxc6+ bxc6 8. Nf3 Ba6 9. Kf2 in another game, after the better (according to FireBird 1.2) 9. Ng5, Mouret answered calmly with 9... Bc8 (Tremaine - Mouret, London 1819) 9... cxd4 10. Nxd4 c5 11. Nf3 Nh6 12. h3 Be7 13. g4 O-O 14. Qb3 Qc6 15. Kg3 Rae8 16. Qd1 Nf7 17. h4 Bd8 18. Qc2 Bb7 and FireBird 1.2 evaluates that Black's position widely compensate the pawn. After 19. Ng5 White initiative on the kingside was rebutted with 19... Bxg5 20. hxg5 g6 21. Qh2 h6 22. gxh6 and now Mouret could have obtained a good advantage with 22...d4! (FireBird 1.2), he played instead the somewhat inferior 22... Kh7 and won in a few moves after a blunder of his opponent. The most known game of Mouret, however, is a loss played (together with Boncourt) against De Labourdonnais. It is an Evans Gambit of a certain theoretical interest for the time, which was reported both in Le PalamèdeLe Palamède, Edited by de P.

It was the first professional orchestra that existed for any notable length in the city of Toronto. After 13 seasons of performance, the orchestra folded in 1918 because of problems related to World War I. The current Toronto Symphony Orchestra is unrelated to this one. History The TSO was founded in 1906 under the name the Toronto Conservatory Symphony Orchestra by Frank Welsman. The orchestra was originally formed as a student ensemble for the Toronto Conservatory of Music (TCM), and during its first two years the orchestra was made up of only students and faculty from the school. Faculty member and violinist Bertha Drechsler Adamson served as the orchestra's concertmistress. In 1908 the TSO cut ties with the TCM and became an entirely professional orchestra that was governed by a board under the leadership of Toronto businessman H.C. Cox. The orchestra received financial support from the Massey family. At that time the orchestra was renamed the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. Welsman continued in his roles as conductor and artistic director and many of the conservatory's faculty members continued to play with the orchestra. Frank Blachford was appointed the new concertmaster and other professionals were hired at this time to raise the overall playing talent of the orchestra. Composer and cellist Leo Smith joined the orchestra in 1910 after leaving the orchestra of the Royal Opera House in London. He eventually became principal cellist of the ensemble and served as the author of the ensemble's program notes from 1910-1918. Some of the other notable musicians in the orchestra included Jack Arthur, Luigi Romanelli, and Harry Adaskin. TSO gave its first full season of professional concerts in 1908 at Massey Hall. The orchestra concerts were popular events among Toronto's social elite. The TSO attempted to reach a different audience by establishing extra concerts of popular music in 1909 with ticket prices at just 25 cents. During its history, the TSO mainly performed works from the standard German Classical and Romantic period repertoires, such as symphonies by Ludwig van Beethoven, Joseph Haydn, Felix Mendelssohn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Franz Schubert. In 1911 the ensemble gave a program entirely devoted to the works of Richard Wagner. Strangely absent from the orchestra's repertoire were the works of Johannes Brahms. The group also performed more rarely heard works such as both of Karl Goldmark's symphonies and Richard Strauss's Death and Transfiguration. Outside of the German repertoire, the TSO performed such works as Antonín Dvořák's Symphony No. 9, several symphonic works by Vasily Kalinnikov, and the final three symphonies by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky among others. In April 1911 the ensemble performed Edward Elgar's oratorio The Dream of Gerontius with the composer as guest conductor and the Sheffield Choir. A survey taken of audience members in 1913 revealed that the group's most popularly received works were Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6, Mendelssohn's A Midsummer Night's Dream, and Franz Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2. The TSO was host to many important musicians. Sergei Rachmaninoff notably performed his own Piano Concerto No. 2 with the orchestra in 1914. Other notable guests included pianists Wilhelm Backhaus and Vladimir de Pachmann; singers Clara Butt, Johanna Gadski, Alma Gluck, Louise Homer, Leo Slezak, and Ernestine Schumann- Heink; and violinists Mischa Elman, Carl Flesch, Fritz Kreisler, and Eugène Ysaÿe. During World War I, the TSO began to experience financial difficulties and faced other war related problems affecting travel, audience attendance, and the ability to keep its players. Ultimately these problems compounded and the orchestra disbanded in 1918.

She is the Director of Music at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland and is a renowned authority on the works of Sergei Prokofiev.  Biography  McAllister was born on 6 March 1946 in Mossend, North Lanarkshire. She undertook her undergraduate studies at the University of Glasgow, graduating BMus with first class honours. At the same time she was a part-time student at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama studying piano with Wight Henderson and viola with Frieda Peters. She studied composition with Anthony Hedges and Robin Orr, and won the first BBC Scotland Young Composer’s prize in 1966. In the late 1960s she spent three years at the University of Cambridge researching the operas of Sergei Prokofiev; she completed her PhD in 1970. Her work on Prokofiev resulted in intensive work in Moscow, Saint Petersburg and throughout the southern USSR. In the 1970s and 1980s she broadcast and published extensively on many aspects of Soviet and Russian music. Her compositions from this time include chamber works, song cycles and works for music theatre, as well as electro-acoustic pieces.

Television career  After college, Farias worked in New York City as a researcher for on the A&E; documentary series “The Eagle and The Bear”, which looked at the history of US-Soviet relations through the prism of the Cold War. 52 episodes aired on A&E.; He also worked as a researcher on a 1989 episode of Dateline about the Tiananmen Square incident.  Radio career  In October 2003, Farias joined the Howard Dean presidential campaign as an aide and met physician and radio personality Mike Newcomb. Newcomb, at the time affiliated with Nova M Radio, had a radio talk show called “the Dr. Mike Show”. That meeting led Farias to a job as the producer for “the Dr. Mike Show”, at KFNX, out of Arizona. from June 2004 to April 2005. In 2005, Farias moved to the new Air America Radio station featured at KXXT where he was given a weekend show called the “Truth to Power Hour”, which he co-hosted with Arizona state Representative Kyrsten Sinema. In 2007, when KXXT was sold to a Christian broadcasting station, KPHX, Jeff became Head of Production. In March 2007, Farias was given the afternoon drive slot at KPHX, \\"The Jeff Farias Show\\", a progressive radio show. Farias, as a talk show host, interviewed many political figures, including Scott Ritter, Mike Malloy, Cindy Sheehan, Rev.

The current version supports Windows Presentation Foundation applications. GUI verification is done primarily using image comparisons. Test suites can run interactively or fully automated. Philosophy IcuTest is not a record-and-playback system. Such systems can produce test scripts that are difficult to maintain.Memon, A: GUI testing: Pitfalls and process, \\"IEEE Computer\\", 2002.Xie,Q: Developing cost- effective model-based techniques for GUI testing, \\"ICSE ’06: Proceedings of the 28th international conference on Software engineering\\", 2006. Rather, IcuTest believes that the most effective place to test is within the unit test. Hence, IcuTest forgoes any recording mechanism and, like typical unit tests, relies on the programmer to define the scope and parameters of the test. Usage A typical IcuTest provides direct control of the app under test. Here is an example that ensures that the ViewModel is correct. [TestMethod] public void TestMyWindow_WithDataContext() { ICU.Invoke(() => { var w = new MyWindow(); w.Show(); ICU.CheckView(w, \\"MyWindowTest\\"); w.DataContext = new MyViewModel(); ICU.CheckView(w, \\"MyWindowTest_with_ViewModel\\"); w.Close(); }); } ICU.CheckView is the main testing (or Assert) mechanism in IcuTest. It performs a fast bitmap comparison between the current UI snapshot and a previously stored snapshot. Like an Assert, CheckView throws an exception when a test fails. IcuTest offers higher level tools specifically designed to help GUI testing. Here is an example that illustrates: * IcuTest Scenarios * Coded UI automation * BDD (Behavior Driven Development) support * GWT (Given, When, Then) and AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) fluency [TestMethod] public void cannot_login_with_invalid_password() { var context = new WindowScenario(); ICU.Given(context) // Optional BDD specs .AsA(\\"MyApp User\\") .IWant(\\"a login window\\") .SoThat(\\"I have secure access to MyApp data\\") .When(() => { // set wrong password using GUI automation set_login(context.Window, \\"myname\\", \\"wrong password\\"); }) .Then(() => { // window should display \\"invalid login\\" message ICU.CheckView(context.Window, \\"login_with_invalid_pass\\"); }) .Test(); } void set_login(ExampleLoginWindow w, string user, string pass) { var userBox = guiHelper.Find(w, \\"userBox\\"); var passBox = guiHelper.Find(w, \\"passwordBox\\"); var loginBtn = guiHelper.Find(w, \\"LoginButton\\"); userBox.Text = user; passBox.Password = pass; guiHelper.Click(loginBtn); } Features With IcuTest, you can: * Create simple, maintainable GUI Tests * Ensure solid, feature complete applications * Support TDD and BDD best practices * Use with MSTest, NUnit, XUnit, MbUnit, etc... * Find bugs quickly and automatically * Produce better code coverage * Promote confident refactoring * Alleviate manual testing and debugging  References  Category:Graphical user interface testing Category:Unit testing ","title":"IcuTest"},{"id":"26674231","text":"Archibald Corble (26 May 1883 - 22 January 1944) was a British fencer.

The novel received rave reviews and focuses on Nora Grey, a teenager whose life is at risk after beginning a romance with new student Patch, a fallen angel with a dark connection to Nora. Book rights to Hush, Hush have been sold to over 13 countries, with LD Entertainment purchasing film rights. Plot Nora Grey is an average sophomore student living in Coldwater, Maine. Her life is largely uneventful until she is seated next to a mysterious senior named Patch Cipriano in biology class, who had failed the subject several times before. The two are initially at odds, but Nora finds herself inexplicably drawn to him, his behavior both attractive and repelling. Despite the strong pull she feels towards him, Nora continues to tell her best friend Vee that she's not interested in Patch. Vee later invites Nora to a local amusement park, Delphic, in an attempt to set her up with Elliot, a boy who has expressed an attraction to Nora. The trip turns awkward when the group runs into Patch, who makes Elliot jealous. Nora confronts Patch and he persuades Nora to meet him in front of the newly reformed roller coaster, the Archangel. Nora later makes an excuse to find something to eat and sets off to find Patch. After she finds Patch, he manages to persuade her to ride the Archangel. The ride turns into a disaster after Nora falls from the roller coaster, only to realize it was her imagination. The incident leaves her shaken up. When Nora is unable to locate Vee and the others at the amusement park, she is left with no option but to allow Patch to drive her home. Once home, Patch offers to make tacos. Nora becomes suspicious and worried as the knife he uses changes sizes. The two nearly kiss but are interrupted by her mom calling in an attempt to check on Nora. Nora becomes increasingly more connected with Patch and begins to change her opinion of him, especially after meeting his closest and only friend Rixon. Meanwhile, she also begins to grow more curious and suspicious of Elliot after discovering his involvement in a murder case in his last school. Nora becomes extremely afraid after a bag lady is murdered in front of her. She'd given the woman her coat and hat in exchange for directions. She calls Patch for a ride home due to the rain and her fear, but his Jeep breaks down partway through and the pair are forced to take shelter in a shabby motel. While in the room, Nora finds that Patch has an upside down V on his back, which she earlier thought was her imagination during a play fight between Rixon and Patch at Bo's Arcade. Fascinated by it, she manages to touch the scar and is pulled into his memories of his past. This prompts Patch to demand to know what she had seen, and Nora to demand answers about what she has seen. This leads to the revelation that Patch is actually a fallen angel from Heaven who was trying to kill her, and in doing so, gain a human body. Her death would kill his Nephilim vassal Chauncey Langeais and make Patch completely human. She also discovers that Patch has an ex-girlfriend named Dabria, who is also Nora's new counselor at school, an angel of death who wants Patch to save Nora's life so he can become a guardian angel and so he can get back together with her. Patch had initially discarded Dabria's idea out of a desire to become human, but the plan failed because he had fallen in love with Nora. It is soon revealed that her friend Jules is actually Chauncey, who wants revenge on Patch for tricking him into swearing an oath that will allow Patch to take over his body during the Hebrew month of Cheshvan. After leaving the motel and going home, Dabria breaks into Nora's room and says that she wants to kill Nora in order to prevent Patch from doing so and becoming human. Nora is narrowly saved by Patch, who goes after Dabria and strips her of her wings in vengeance, already knowing the archangels would have done the same for trying to kill Nora. Nora is later invited to a game of hide-and-seek with Vee, Jules, and Elliot, with Elliot hinting that Vee will not survive the game if Nora doesn't participate. Despite Patch attempting to get her to remain behind in the car, Nora goes after them. She soon discovers Jules unmoving body, presuming Elliot killed him, only to be cornered by Jules, who confesses that he was behind various attacks on her life as a way of getting revenge on Patch. The game continues as they are held at gunpoint by Jules. Nora struggles with Jules while Patch tries to distract him, but this fails and Patch is forced to possess Nora's body to fight him. The process leaves Patch unconscious after he's separated from her body because it is not the month of Cheshvan. In an attempt to escape, Nora climbs to the rafters of the school gym, but Jules uses mind tricks to make her believe that the ladders are breaking and that she is going to fall to her death. Patch manages to break through the tricks by making her focus on his voice in her mind. Jules begins to climb the ladder after her, but Nora confronts him with the knowledge that if she were to sacrifice her life, Patch would become human and Jules would die. With this in mind, Nora throws herself from the rafters, which effectively kills Jules. To her surprise, Nora wakes up alive and well. Patch explains that he did not take her sacrifice because there was no point in having a human body without her. In doing so, Patch has saved Nora's life and is now her guardian angel. The two share a romantic moment, ending the book. Characters Nora Grey : Nora Grey is the main protagonist and narrator of Hush, Hush. Nora lives with her mother in the farmhouse in Coldwater, Maine, and attends Coldwater High School with her best friend Vee Sky. She is studious and diligent. Her father, Harrison Grey, was murdered a year ago. She meets Patch when Coach decides to have a new seat arrangement and becomes her new biology partner. At first, she is reluctant to have Patch as her partner but eventually becomes intrigued by him. She falls for him against her better judgment. Jules and Patch mention several times that she has a \\"weak mind\\"; this doesn't mean that she's weak-willed, but that it's extremely difficult for her to block out mind controllers. Patch Cipriano :Patch Cipriano, a new senior at Coldwater High, is Nora's new biology partner. He is a powerful fallen angel who has a lot of enemies. He spends his time playing pool at Bo's Arcade. He didn't care for anything else other than becoming human until he meets Nora Grey. He keeps his past under wraps and is accused of telling more lies than truths from Nora, although he simply avoids the questions. He can be sly and brooding, and frequently leaves Nora alternately furious or tongue- tied. He uses his charms as a way of getting what he wants and avoiding unwanted questions, though he begins to open up as the novel progresses. Nora eventually learns he is a fallen angel, who fell when he loved a human girl and tried to be with her. After failing to take control of a human body, the avenging angels ripped Patch's wings off on his way back to heaven. He cannot feel physically — it is described as experiencing the world through a pane of glass — but he can experience emotions. When he is restored as a guardian angel, he regains the ability to fly, though he still cannot feel, as he has not yet \\"earned\\" that right. Later in the story his real name is revealed to be Jev. Vee Sky : Vee is Nora's best friend. Vee is described as a \\"green- eyed, minky blonde, and a few pounds over curvy\\". She is funny throughout the book, but can be a bit immature, especially about \\"S-E-X\\". She is also quick to judge people and will ignore facts if she doesn't like them. She is later attacked by a man in a ski mask, later revealed to be Dabria/Miss Greene. After the attack, she shows an extreme distrust in Patch, mistaking him for the attacker. Elliot Saunders : Elliot is a guy that Nora met at a shop. He originally flirted with and defended Nora at every opportunity. Nora later discovers that he is suspected of killing a girl, leaving her unsure of his true character. It is revealed that Jules is his benefactor as a scholar in Kinghorn Prep. Later on, Jules tests Elliot's loyalty by making him choose between his lover and his education, with Elliot ultimately giving in to Jules. He is revealed to be Jules' pawn in his plan on exacting revenge on Patch by hurting Nora. He is incapacitated by Jules in the school library while luring Nora into the trap.

Lynx rufus oaxacensis) is a population of the bobcat in Mexico. The Mexican bobcat is most commonly found in the states of Sinaloa and Nayarit. As of 2017, it is uncertain whether or not this is a valid subspecies. Appearance The Mexican bobcat is the smallest of the bobcat subspecies and grows to about twice the size of a house cat. It is similar in appearance to the lynx except for the tail, which is darker in color. Adults of this species range from nine to thirty pounds. The coat color of this animal varies from light gray to reddish brown. The coat is covered in more spots than that of the northern subspecies of bobcat and has shorter, denser hair than its northern cousin. This species has the distinctive black stripes of fur on the forelegs and a black tip on the tail along with black tipped ears and a whiskered face. A tuft of fur frames the animal's face. Habitat The Mexican bobcat is found throughout Mexico, but primarily in Baja, western Mexico, and southward from the Sonoran desert. The creature is also found in the Mexican states of Sinaloa and Nayarit, as well as parts of Sonora, Jalisco, Durango, San Luis Potosí, Nuevo León, Hidalgo, Morelos, Puebla, Tlaxcala, Tamaulipas, Michoacán, Guerrero, Veracruz, and Oaxaca. The Mexican bobcat lives in a variety of areas, including forests, coastal swamps, deserts, and scrublands. The animals are nonmigratory and are territorial. The territory of a male Mexican bobcat may stretch for a few miles and overlap with several female bobcat and male bobcat territories. The female Mexican bobcat's territory rarely overlaps with another female's territory. Lifestyle Mexican bobcats are carnivores and eat rodents, jackrabbits, collared peccaries, birds, deer, and white-nosed coatis. On occasion they will hunt snakes, lizards, and scorpions. They are solitary, nocturnal animals and are rarely seen by humans. The animals gather briefly once a year to mate. The Mexican bobcat breeding season can take place anytime during the year and is not strictly limited to spring. The female gives birth to a litter of two to three kittens, which she raises on her own. The species generally lives for ten to twelve years. Threats Modern threats to the Mexican bobcat are habitat destruction, illegal trapping and shooting, and militarization of the U.S. - Mexico border. Although the bobcat was added to the U.S. Endangered Species List in June 1976, a delisting of the Mexican bobcat species was proposed in 2003. An official proposition to delist the species was made a few years later, although the species still remains on the list.

The Security Council confirmed the intention of the international community to restore democracy in Haiti and the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The need for free and fair elections, as called for in the constitution, was stressed. Killings, illegal detentions, abductions, disappearances, instances of rape, the denial of freedom of expression and the impunity under which armed citizens operated were all condemned. The Council recalled that further measures would be considered if the Haitian authorities continued to impede the activities of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) and failed to implement the Governors Island Agreement. Sanctions Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the parties were called upon to co-operate with the United Nations and the Organization of American States (OAS) to implement the agreement. All countries were told immediately to prohibit any aircraft to take off from, land in, or overfly their territory if it was destined to land in, or had taken off from Haiti, excluding humanitarian reasons. They were also called upon to deny entry to: :(a) Haitian military and police officers and their immediate families; :(b) those involved in the coup d'état in 1991 and subsequent illegal government and their immediate families; :(c) employees of the Haitian military and their immediate families. In all, the ban affected around 600 officers. Funds were also ordered to be frozen, and measures outlined below, consistent with the embargo recommended by the OAS, were to take effect no later than 23:59 EST. All countries were: :(a) prohibited from receiving imports or exporting to Haiti; :(b) to ban activities by nationals in their territories which would promote exports to Haiti. Additionally, all exports were banned to Haiti, excluding: :(a) medical and food supplies; :(b) other products essential for humanitarian use, permitted by the Committee; :(c) petroleum or petroleum products, including cooking gas; :(d) products authorised in Resolution 873. It was decided that the above prohibitions would not apply to information materials, including books and materials for journalists. All traffic to and from Haiti carrying prohibited goods was banned, except for regular shipping lines carrying approved goods. French, American, Canadian and Venezuelan boats patrolled the Haitian coast to ensure the application of the embargo. All countries were requested to report to the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali by 6 June 1994 on the measures they had taken to implement the present resolution. The Committee established in Resolution 841 was entrusted with additional functions including: :(a) to examine reports submitted by Member States; :(b) to obtain further information on action taken by countries; :(c) to consider information concerning violations of the measures; :(d) to make recommendations based on the violations; :(e) to consider any applications for approval regarding flights; :(f) to amend guidelines in Resolution 841 to take account of measures in the current resolution; :(g) to examine possible requests under Article 50 of the United Nations Charter for any states affected by the sanctions against Haiti. The measures would be reviewed monthly a democratic government returned to Haiti and would be suspended if progress had been made, but would not be lifted until: :(a) the resignation or departure from Haiti of the Commander-in-Chief of the Haitian Armed Forces, the Chief of Police of Port-au-Prince, and the Chief of Staff of the Haitian Armed Forces; :(b) changes in the leadership of the police and military high command; :(c) the creation of an environment where free and fair elections could be held; :(d) the creation of conditions where UNMIH could be deployed; :(e) the return of President Aristide.

It was first activated in 1946 in the Panama Canal Zone as the 630th Aircraft Control Squadron, but was inactivated two years later. It was activated again in 1953 as the 630th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, a Tactical Air Command radar unit that replaced an Air National Guard unit mobilized for the Korean War. It transferred to Air Defense Command, which inactivated it the following year. The squadron was activated again in 1972 as the 630th Radar Squadron and used military and Federal Aviation Administration radars to provide surveillance in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1989 it returned to its original area in Panama, where it focused on counter-drug operations under various designations until the Air Force withdrew its forces in Panama in 1999. It was converted to provisional status as an expeditionary unit in 2009. History =Defense of the Panama Canal= The squadron was first activated in 1946 in the Panama Canal Zone as the 630th Aircraft Control Squadron, an aircraft direction and control squadron, collocated with its parent 530th Aircraft Control and Warning Group at Quarry Heights, Panama Canal Zone, when the radar detection mission previously performed by the Signal Corps was combined with the direction mission performed by Air Corps units. The group performed the aircraft detection, warning and control mission for the Canal Zone for Sixth Air Force (later Caribbean Air Command).

While at Alexandria, the squadron was attached to the 629th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron. It moved to Camp Edwards, Massachusetts in January 1954 to join the 532d Group headquarters. At Camp Edwards, the 532d was transferred from Tactical Air Command to Air Defense Command (ADC) as the 532d Aircraft Control and Warning Group, Mobile. The group and squadron were inactivated before the end of the year.Cornett & Johnson, p. 83 =Shared FAA radar= The squadron was redesignated the 630th Radar Squadron and activated at the Federal Aviation Administration's Houston Air Route Traffic Control Center in August 1972 as part of the Southern Air Defense System (SADS) In 1969, the inadequacy of the radar coverage to the south of the United States were dramatically illustrated when a Cuban MiG-17 went undetected before it landed at Homestead Air Force Base, FloridaLeonard, p. 172 and two years later, an Antonov An-24 similarly arrived unannounced at New Orleans International Airport. As a result, ADC established SADS with the squadron operating a manual control center at the Houston ARTCC and added radars to supplement the existing Federal Aviation Administration coverage in the area, which were manned by the operating locations of the squadron. The squadron was inactivated at the end of 1977. =Return to Panama= The squadron returned to its earlier designation as the 630th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron in 1988 and was activated on 1 April at Howard Air Force Base, Panama. It was redesignated the 630th Radar Squadron the following year. The unit focused on counter drug operations.See Its mission changed in 1993, when it became the 630th Air Operations Squadron and in 1994, it was renumbered to its parent wing's number. It was finally inactivated when the USAF shut down its operations in Panama in conjunction with the turnover of the former Canal Zone to Panama. =Expeditionary unit= On 12 February 2009, the squadron was converted to provisional status as the 24th Expeditionary Air Support Operations Squadron and assigned to Air Combat Command to activate or inactivate as needed for contingency operations.

He belonged to the Phagmodrupa Dynasty, the leading regime in Tibet from 1354 to 1435. Tenure as abbot and regent Sonam Drakpa was the son of Rinchen Dorje, a brother of the regent Jamyang Shakya Gyaltsen. At the age of nine he was elevated to abbot of the Tsethang monastery, succeeding his eldest brother Drakpa Rinchen. In 1381 he took the dignity of regent (desi) of Tibet after the abdication of his other brother Drakpa Changchub.Giuseppe Tucci, Deb T'er Dmar Po Gsarma. Rome 1971, p. 214. His short rule was considered by the Tibetans to be particularly prosperous, with excellent crops. He was therefore known as \\"the Fortunate King\\".Tsepon W. D. Shakabpa, Tibet. A Political History. Yale 1967, p. 83. Pushed from power The Hongwu Emperor of the Ming dynasty conferred the title Guanding Guoshi on Sonam Drakpa, who is called Sonan Jiasibayi Jian Cangbu in the dynastic annals.Giuseppe Tucci, Tibetan Painted Scrolls. Rome 1949, Vol. II, p. 692. That the Ming Dynasty had limited insight in Tibetan affairs at this time is indicated by the erroneous statement that Sonam Drakpa directly succeeded his uncle Jamyang Shakya Gyaltsen. Nevertheless, the Chinese titles conferred on various Tibetan lords were evidently valued since they are also mentioned in Tibetan chronicles. In 1385 Sonam Drakpa was forced to abdicate his political powers under murky circumstances. Another branch of the family grabbed power, supported by certain ministers and feudatories.Ariane Macdonald, 'Préambule à la lecture d'un Rgya-Bod yig-chan'. Journal asiatique 963, p. 103-4. Sonam Drakpa sent a letter to the Hongwu Emperor, claiming that he was ill and therefore suggested his cousin Drakpa Gyaltsen as his successor. This was endorsed by the Chinese emperor.Giuseppe Tucci, 1949, Vol. II, p. 692. The abdicated regent withdrew to the monastery Thel. In 1405 he became a kunpang, a person who completely renounces the world. Three years later he died.Giuseppe Tucci, 1971, p. 214.

(True Sounds of Liberty), released in 1984 through Enigma Records. It was the band's first album with singer/guitarist Joe Wood and drummer Mitch Dean, replacing founding members Jack Grisham and Todd Barnes who had left the band in late 1983. The album was recorded using money loaned to T.S.O.L. by the Dead Kennedys, and found the new incarnation of the band moving away from the hardcore punk associations of the original lineup in favor of a traditional rock and gothic rock sound. Change Today? was reissued in 1999 through the Enigma subsidiary Restless Records, adding four tracks from the recording sessions that had been left off the original album. Background and recording On their 1983 album Beneath the Shadows, T.S.O.L. had moved away from hardcore punk, adding keyboards to their lineup and shifting in a gothic rock direction in the vein of the Damned and Siouxsie and the Banshees. Though the album received positive reviews from critics, it was largely rejected by their hardcore fanbase. In late 1983 singer Jack Grisham, drummer Todd Barnes, and keyboardist Greg Kuehn all left the band.Blush, pp. 95–96. Grisham cited increased violence and police presence at shows, as well as audiences looking to him for instruction, as factors in his departure.Blush, p. 95. Guitarist Ron Emory and bassist Mike Roche continued on as T.S.O.L., assembling a new lineup in February 1984 that included drummer Mitch Dean, formerly of the Joneses, and singer/guitarist Joe Wood (Wood later married Grisham's sister). The Dead Kennedys loaned the group their van to tour the United States. They began to write new material that reflected the growing British gothic rock genre they admired, coming up with 20–30 songs. However, they faced a lack of interest from record labels in financing a recording session. The Dead Kennedys again assisted the band, loaning them money for studio time. Over the course of four nights at Mad Dog Studio in Venice, California T.S.O.L. recorded their new songs with recording engineer Stuart Schanwetter and producer Chris Grayson. The tracks were mastered by Eddy Schreyer, and the band chose ten to comprise Change Today?, which was picked up for release by Enigma Records. The group toured constantly in the two months leading up to its release, playing nine of the album's ten songs in their set. \\"We would leave out 'Flowers by the Door, recalled Dean, \\"because we thought it was weak and it just barely made it onto the album. Once the record was released it became the most popular song from Change Today?, which goes to show that sometimes the artists are too close to the music and basically don't know shit.\\" They continued to tour in support of the album for almost two years on small budgets, making –25 a night and staying at friends' houses or packing the entire band and crew into a single hotel room. Reception Bradley Torreano of Allmusic remarks that Change Today? had \\"a different flair than the group had in the past. The guitars were gloomier and more focused, while Wood's melodramatic croon sharpened the whole affair into a unique L.A. goth sound.\\" Allmusic's Robert Gabriel gave the album three stars out of five, saying that it \\"marked quite a stylistic twist for the band. Known up to that time as a hardcore punk outfit, T.S.O.L. suddenly became much more of a traditional rock group with more in common with the Doors than the Damned. All things considered, Change Today? is actually a fine album, most notable for its inspired songwriting and driving guitars.\\" Reissue Change Today? was remastered and reissued in 1999 through the Enigma subsidiary Restless Records.

He served as a Bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. He was the last bishop of the missionary district of west Texas and the first bishop of the Diocese of West Texas. He was also the founder of TMI — The Episcopal School of Texas, a private school in San Antonio, Texas. Biography =Early life= James Steptoe Johnston was born in 1843 in Church Hill, Jefferson County, Mississippi. He was the son of a local attorney and cotton planter. He was educated at Oakland College in Lorman, Mississippi. He attended the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia, but left after one year to enlist in the Confederate States Army. While in college he was a member of the Delta Psi fraternity ( AKA St. Anthony Hall ). He was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Cavalry Corps, Army of Northern Virginia in 1862. He saw action at the Second Battle of Bull Run and at Antietam before being captured by Union forces and spending one year as a prisoner of war. After the war, he studied law for a time and practiced as an attorney until 1867, and then began to read for the priesthood. He was ordained to diaconate in 1869 and to the priesthood in 1871 and served as a parish priest in Mississippi, Kentucky and Alabama. In 1888, he was elected as the second bishop of the missionary district of west Texas and was awarded a Doctorate of Divinity from the University of the South in the same year. =Career= The early years of Johnston's episcopate were difficult. He was the sole bishop for an area of some , most of which was only accessibly on horseback or by stage coach. The area was also experiencing severe economic difficulties due to a prolonged drought. He particularly stressed the need for an educated élite in such an environment, and to this end founded the West Texas School for Boys (now TMI — The Episcopal School of Texas) to provide a classical and Christian education for young men in the area. Johnston raised money for the school from wealthy Episcopalians on the Eastern Seaboard. Johnston was also responsible for the integration of the district, and admitted a congregation of African-Americans who had previously been affiliated with the Methodist Church. A liberal with moderate Tractarian influences, Johnston was committed to dialogue with the Roman Catholic Church (by far the largest religious group in Southern and Western Texas) and wrote on several occasions to Vatican expressing his desire for Christian unity. In 1904, West Texas became a self-supporting diocese with Johnston as its first bishop. Johnston retired in 1916, having served for twenty-eight years as a bishop. =Death= He died in 1924.

A palette is usually made of wood, plastic, ceramic, or other hard, inert, nonporous material, and can vary greatly in size and shape. The most commonly known type of painter's palette is made of a thin wood board designed to be held in the artist's hand and rest on the artist's arm. Watercolor palettes are generally made of plastic or porcelain with rectangular or wheel format with built in wells and mixing areas for colors.  Wet palette  A wet palette is a sealable container with a layer of absorbent material (such as paper towel or sponge) that can be soaked with water and a semi-permeable membrane (such as parchment, greaseproof paper or baking paper (silicone paper)) over that. The paint sits on the membrane and is kept wet by osmosis. The main purpose of the wet palette is to keep acrylic paint, whose drying is irreversible, workable. Only paints that are water soluble, such as acrylics, work on wet palettes, as it is the movement of water through the palette paper that keeps the paint wet. Wet palettes are easily made with common household supplies and many painters choose to use homemade ones, however many companies make commercial wet palettes.

His works include the documentary film Arthur Rubinstein – The Love of Life. Biography After high school in Poitiers, Gérard Patris joined an art school in Paris. Early into his career, Patris founded a workshop in Paris in lithography. The job allowed him to meet many of the major artists of the post-war period for the attainment of prints as Dubuffet, Sprockets, Manessier, Sonderborg, Arman, Hayter, Hartung or Matta. Gérard Patris had two daughters from different partners. The late muse of Picasso, Sylvette David (now in her 70s and known as Lydia Corbett, see Sylvette) and Marie-Claire Schaeffer, his first wife, were the two mothers. Marie-Claire Schaeffer is the daughter of the composer Pierre Schaeffer, often presented as the father of music concrete. This meeting allowed him to participate, under the direction of Pierre Schaeffer, the research service of the ORTF to create relationships on Sound / Text / Image.

For the last few years until its demise in February 1997, the ferries from Ostend went to Ramsgate instead of Dover in partnership with Sally Line. History On 28 February 1997 the Belgian state closed an important and historical period concerning transport of passengers from and to the UK. The first official crossing ever under the Belgian state took place in 1846, a history spanning 151 years. Service was inaugurated between Ostend and Dover on 4 March 1846, by the paddle steamer Chemin de Fer, which was later renamed Diamant. Trouville-Le Havre on \\"Bateau du Havre\\"overblog Owing to the great competition with lines serving Calais, Dunkirk, Zeebrugge, Antwerp, Rotterdam and Hoek van Holland, RMT upgraded their fleet through the years, from paddle steamers to turbine steamers, diesel motor vessels, and finally high speed ferries. Many of the line's ships were built at Antwerp by the shipyard of SA John Cockerill. A rare accident for the company occurred when the RMT paddle steamers Princesse Henriette and Comtesse de Flandre collided in heavy fog on 29 March 1889 when both attempt to avoid collision with a fishing smack offshore between Ruytingen and Dunkirk. Princesse Henriette struck Comtesse de Flandre on the starboard side, just abaft the paddle box, nearly slicing the vessel in half. The inrush of water caused a boiler explosion, and the Comtesse de Flandre sank with a loss of 15 lives, of whom four were passengers. Princesse Henriette rescued 32 survivors, including 19 passengers. Among the survivors was Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte II.Charles Hocking, Dictionary of Disasters at Sea During the Age of Steam, Vol 1, p. 158. London: Naval and Military Press, 1989. A major shift in propulsion took place in 1905 with the construction of RMT's first turbine steamer, Princesse Elisabeth. RMT ferries saw use in both world wars. Early in the First World War, the turbine steamer Jan Breydel evacuated Elisabeth of Bavaria, Queen of Belgium and the royal children on 28 August 1914. Later, vessels of the line evacuated diplomats, troops and important officials before the fall of Antwerp. One RMT paddle steamer, Flandre, fell into German hands and was employed by them as a depot ship. Flandre was scuttled at Ostend upon the withdrawal of German troops in October 1918. The paddle steamer Marie Henriette was wrecked on 24 October 1914 on rocks while attempting to enter Barfleur with 650 wounded military personnel on board. The accident was attributed to the harbour lights having been unexpectedly extinguished. Later, the paddle steamer Princesse Clementine and turbine steamer Princesse Elisabeth were employed as fast military transports between Dover and ports in Flanders, whilst the paddle steamer Rapide and turbine steamer Stad Antwerpen saw service as hospital ships. The company's newest vessel at the time, the turbine steamer Ville de Liège, was used as a fast evacuation transport (technically not a hospital ship, as the steamer was armed and painted in dazzle camouflage). Owing to its lower speed, the line's oldest vessel at the time, the paddle steamer Belgique (built in 1862) was employed during the war in more militarily protected waters as an ammunition transport between Southampton and Le Havre. After augmenting the fleet postwar with additional turbine ferries, RMT received its first diesel ferry, Prince Baudouin, in 1934. When RMT began transporting automobiles and lorries as well as passengers, cars had to be loaded onto a steamer's aft deck and offloaded again using a quay crane. Service was greatly improved in 1936 when the turbine steamer Ville de Liège was renovated as a roll on-roll off car ferry and renamed London-Istanbul. After the fall of Belgium and France in June 1940, vessels of RMT were taken into the Royal Navy for use in the landing ship infantry role. These included the steamers Prince Charles (270 troops), Prince Leopold (255 troops), Princesse Astrid (247 troops), Princesse Josephine Charlotte (210 troops), Prince Baudouin (384 troops), Prins Albert (350 troops), and Prince Philippe (350 troops). An older steamer, Princesse Marie José, was employed as an auxiliary patrol vessel. HMS Prince Philippe was lost in a collision on 15 July 1941, whilst HMS Prince Leopold was sunk by a U-boat on 29 July 1944.Robert Gardiner and Roger Chesneau, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1922-1946, pp. 73, 83. New York: Mayflower Books, 1980. After the war, the surviving ships were returned to RMT. In 1949 the company took delivery of the motor vessel Prinses Josephine Charlotte, the first of a series of car ferries. The standard timetable for most of the 1980s and 90s saw six crossings per day in each direction. In addition to traditional car ferries, RMT also operated two Boeing Jetfoils (for foot-passengers only) that reduced crossing times from 4 hours to 100 minutes. They were popular with connecting rail passengers, and a supplement was payable. However, these services were prone to cancellation in bad weather, with passengers re- directed to the car ferry. In response to the announcement of the Channel Tunnel project, RMT ordered one of the first cross-channel super ferries. The Prins Filip cost $100,000,000, and at 28,828 gross register tons was the largest ferry operating on the short sea routes of the English Channel from 1991 to 2001 (with the introduction in the latter year of the Seafrance Rodin). Nonetheless, the opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994 led to shorter transit times across the Channel for cars and freight, while new high-speed Eurostar services running directly between London and Brussels rendered traditional rail-sea-rail journeys obsolete. Unable to stem heavy financial losses, the Belgian government took the decision to close the company in 1997. Many of the assets were sold to Transeuropa Ferries which revived the route between Ramsgate and Ostend, first as a freight-only service, and subsequently taking passengers and cars. However, this itself closed in 2013 and there is currently no car ferry between South East England and Belgium. Sealink As part of the Sealink consortium, Regie voor Maritiem Transport connected Oostende railway station with Dover Western Docks (the Sealink and Southern Region of British Rail) terminal. At Ostend, direct international rail connections ran daily as far as Cologne, Berlin, Vienna, Copenhagen and Moscow. The UK arm of Sealink was privatized in 1984, and disagreements with the new owners of the UK operation led to RMT leaving the consortium. Between 1985 and 1990, RMT operated in partnership with European Ferries under the Townsend Thoresen and P&O; badges, and subsequently independently, as Oostende Lines. In 1993, RMT went into partnership with Sally Line transferring its UK terminal from the Port of Dover to the Port of Ramsgate. However, inferior road and rail connections did not help the company's financial position and contributed to its financial losses and eventual closure.

James Savage and others founded the bank on the belief that \\"savings banks would enable the less fortunate classes of society to better themselves in a manner which would avoid the dangers of moral corruption traditionally associated with outright charitable institutions.\\" History =19th century= \\"The leading citizens of Boston ... felt that participation in the administration of the savings banks in their [city] was an integral part of their civic duties.\\" Led by Savage, founders of the bank included William Ellery Channing, William Cochran, Thomas Dawes, Samuel Eliot, Jonathan Hunnewell, John Phillips, William Phillips, Jesse Putnam, Josiah Quincy, Richard Sullivan, Elisha Ticknor, Redford Webster. Boston's Catholic bishop, John Cheverus, provided significant start-up energy, since a savings bank would encourage virtuous thrifty behavior amongst his parishioners. Early meetings took place in the Exchange Coffee House. They agreed the \\"object of the institution\\" was \\"to provide a safe and profitable mode of enabling industrious persons of all descriptions to invest such parts of their earnings or property, as they can conveniently spare, in a manner which will afford them both profit and security. In the first decades of its history, the Provident occupied several buildings in downtown Boston -- Court Street (ca.1817), in the courthouse; Scollay Square (1823–1833), in Scollay's building; Tremont Street (1833–1856), adjacent to King's Chapel Burying Ground; and Temple Place (beginning in 1856), in the former mansion of Thomas Handasyd Perkins. At first, only people who lived in Boston or Charlestown would be admitted as depositors. In 1822, the bank expanded its client base to include depositors from \\"Quincy, Milton, Dorchester, Dedham, Roxbury, Brookline, Waltham, Brighton, Newton, Weston, Cambridge, Watertown, West Cambridge, Medford, Saugus, Malden, and Chelsea.\\" Although the Provident operated as a bank, in its early years it avoided the word \\"bank\\" \\"for the purpose of avoiding a certain sentiment of antipathy, which, at the time, appeared to be entertained toward the existing 'banks' by the common people.\\" The amount of deposits increased dramatically through the years: deposits in 1820 totaled $233,034; in 1830, $986,959; in 1840, $2,071,095; and by 1900, $38,629,876. Into the 19th century, the Provident's early spirit of civic benevolence and socio-economic inclusion may have diminished. According to one historian, the bank \\"sought large deposits, made timely loans to textile firms in which its directors were interested, and generally profiteered.\\" =20th century= In 1986 the Hartford National Corp. bought the Provident Institution for Savings in Boston for $87.2 million. \\"The Provident became a wholly owned subsidiary of Hartford National. However, The Provident, which is the fourth-largest savings bank in Massachusetts, will continue to operate under the name it has been using since 1816.\\" The bank kept its original name through 1992. In 1993, the Provident was merged into Shawmut Bank.

Test marketing began in March 2010. Market Crane Street entrance to the Guinness brewery in Dublin The new product is aimed at young men who prefer chilled, bottled lagers to pints of beer. Guinness believes there are lager drinkers that may be interested in a dark beer but not their famous stout. It is being sold in 330 millilitre bottles for six to nine months in Northern Ireland, as a test market for Europe, and in Malaysia to see whether there are opportunities for the product elsewhere. In Malaysia, the beer will be known as Guinness Premium Beer. It will be offered at a comparable price to other premium lagers. The move follows previous attempts by Diageo to boost sales by introducing variations of Guinness stout. In 2005, the company sold Brew 39 in bars in Dublin and before that it introduced Guinness XXX Extra Strong, Guinness Gold. If the beer sells well during its trial, it will be introduced to other markets in Ireland, Europe and the U.S. Guinness Black Lager is currently available in Australia and Canada. In July 2012, Black Lager was launched into the Republic of Ireland market, available in packs of 4 X 330 ml bottles. =Marketing= Diageo had initially decided not to launch the new beer in the Republic of Ireland because of the massive decrease in alcohol sales in that country. Alcohol consumption has dropped two per cent from its all-time peak in 2001. The lager is being offered at selected bars and off-sales outlets in Northern Ireland. The launch will be accompanied by an advertising and marketing campaign with promotions in bars. As of February 2013, the product is still being advertised in North America. Composition It is a 4.5% a.b.v. strength brew and gets its black colour from the roasted barley added into it. Other Guinness brand products Guinness has made several attempts to vary its brand in the past, some of which were not successful. These include Guinness Breo and Guinness Light.

Sometimes known as \\"the town that fell into the sea\\", it was a planned resort community founded in 1906 on Tillamook Spit, a small stretch of land that forms one wall of Tillamook Bay. Bayocean's post office was established on February 4, 1909, and by 1914, the town's population was 2,000. Only a few decades later however, Bayocean had become a ghost town, having had many of its attractions destroyed by \\"man-induced\\" coastal erosion. The town's unforeseen destruction is believed by many to have been caused by the residents themselves.  Development  The location of Bayocean was said to have been discovered by co-founder Thomas Irving Potter while sight-seeing and hunting along the Oregon Coast. It was called by both T. I. Potter and his father/business partner Thomas Benton Potter, who envisioned the venture as the \\"Atlantic City of the West\\". Believing the site to have an exceptional view of the both Tillamook Bay and the Pacific Ocean, the new town's name was logically derived from both. The dance hall (foreground) and natatorium once located in Bayocean Bayocean had many features uncommon for a small town of its time, including a dance hall, a hotel with orchestra, a 1000-seat movie theater, a shooting range, a bowling alley, tennis courts, a rail system and four miles of paved streets. One notable attraction was a heated natatorium, complete with a wave generator and a special section for a band to play music to entertain the swimmers. While Bayocean's economy was based on tourism, there were other businesses in town, including a cannery, a tin shop, a machine shop, and a Texaco gas station. In a time when many other towns did not have technological infrastructure like electricity or paved roads, Bayocean hosted a water system, a telephone system and a diesel-driven power plant.  Decline  Despite having paved roads, Bayocean was not connected to the rest of the country until the 1920s. Most residents and tourists arrived to the town via T. B. Potter's steamship, the S.S. Bayocean, in a three-day trip from Portland. The final leg of the journey, entering into the unprotected mouth of Tillamook Bay, could provide a rough and frightening experience to passengers. Eventually Bayocean's residents asked the Army Corps of Engineers for a protective jetty to reduce the waves. The Army Corps of Engineers studied the location and suggested that two jetties be built, one on each side of the bay's mouth, at an estimated cost of $2.2 million. Half of that amount was required to come from local residents. With the multimillion-dollar price considered unaffordable, Bayocean's residents proposed and eventually had a single jetty constructed. The price was a little over $800,000 with Bayocean's citizens paying half. Although the new single jetty made for a much smoother journey into the bay, the one-sided change to the coastline began a process of erosion to Bayocean's beaches, slowly narrowing them before overtaking them completely. In 1932, waves from a massive storm finally crossed the beach and destroyed the huge natatorium. The spit itself was further damaged by winter storms in 1939, 1942, 1948, and by 1952 what was left of Bayocean had become an island. Bayocean's post office closed in 1953. What little remained of the town was demolished during the reclamation and dike-building project of 1956. In 1960, Bayocean's last house was washed away, and in 1971, the last remaining building, a garage, finally fell into the ocean.  Legacy  With the addition of a second jetty built in the 1970s, sand began to re-accumulate on the spit. The site is now the location of Bayocean Peninsula County Park and virtually all traces of the town are gone. All that remains of Bayocean is a commemorative sign at the south end of the park.

Begun under Basil I the Macedonian (r. 867–886), it was only completed under his son and successor, Leo VI the Wise (r. 886–912). As its name suggests, it was meant to be an introduction to the legislation of the Basilika, published later during Leo's reign... The work, organized in 40 volumes, covers almost all spheres of law, and was explicitly meant to replace the earlier Ecloga, dating to the iconoclast Isaurian dynasty. Nevertheless, it draws some inspiration from the Ecloga; the main source, however, is the Corpus Juris Civilis of Justinian I (r. 527–565), albeit often heavily altered. Patriarch Photius of Constantinople worked on its compilation, and wrote the preface and the two sections dealing with the position and powers of the Byzantine emperor and the patriarch; notably, the powers of the patriarch appear broader than in Justinian's legislation, both with regards to the emperor and towards the other patriarchates of the Pentarchy. The Epanagoge was withdrawn from official use soon after its publication, being replaced by the Prochiron (which was earlier considered an antecessor of the Epanagoge) twenty years later, but served as the basis for several private law books, such as the Epanagoge Aucta or the Syntagma Canonum.. Through its translation into Slavonic, the Epanagoge found its way into Russian canon law, including the 13th-century Kormchaya Kniga. Its provisions on the patriarch's and church's position vis-a-vis the temporal ruler played a great role in the controversy around Patriarch Nikon in the 17th century..

Biography  Abshagen first worked in insurance, then as a sailor and finally, as a construction worker. He joined the Communist Party of Germany in 1931. Beginning in 1933, he took part in the illegal German Resistance in Hamburg against Nazism. In 1934, he was sentenced in Hamburg state supreme court of \\"Vorbereitung zum Hochverrat\\" (intent to commit treason) to two and a half years at hard labor in a Zuchthaus, which he spent in Bremen-Oslebshausen Prison in Gröpelingen. After serving his sentence, he was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. While at Sachenhausen, Absagen and other prisoners, including Bernhard Bästlein, held cultural and literary gatherings. As the Nazis began to deport more Jews after Kristallnacht, they also plundered their books and stockpiled them in concentration camps. In 1936-1937, the Sachsenhausen library had 500 books and two years later, 800 books. Beginning in 1936, Bästlein and Volker Paddry recited poetry and prose they had learned by heart and Abshagen held programs on proletarian and progressive writings. These programs strengthened the spirit of those who attended, who then lifted the spirit of those who hadn't and thus, the prisoners remained unbroken by their circumstances.Klaus Drobisch and Günther Wieland. \\"System der NS-Konzentrationslager: 1933-1939 p. 322.

Their group later became known as the Bästlein-Jacob-Abshagen Group. Abshagen took charge of various workplace cells and maintained contact with the Resistance in other parts of Germany. In this capacity, Abshagen traveled to Berlin, Saxony and Thuringia and made contact with anti-fascists in the Ruhr area. The special Rote Kapelle commission led to a wave of arrests by the Gestapo in autumn of 1942. The commission's findings related to the activities of Erna Eifler and Wilhelm Fellendorf swept up Abshagen on October 19, 1942.

By birth she belonged to the House of La Trémoïlle. Biography Charlotte Catherine was the youngest of five children born to Louis III de La Trémoille and Jeanne de Montmorency, Duke and Duchess of Thouars, members of two of France's oldest and most powerful families. Her father's family, the La Trémoïlles, held the rank of prince étranger at the French court, and her father was a loyalist of the House of Valois. Her maternal grandfather, Anne de Montmorency, Duke of Montmorency, had been taken captive with King Francis I of France, at the Battle of Pavia in February 1525. She was married at between 17 and 18 years of age, on 16 March 1586 in the chateau de Taillebourg, after converting from Roman Catholicism to Protestantism. Her husband, Henri de Bourbon, Prince de Condé, son of the late Louis de Bourbon, Prince de Condé and Eléanor de Roucy de Roye, was one of the most important men in the kingdom, both as military leader of the Huguenots and, after his cousin obtained the French throne as Henry IV, ranked as heir presumptive and premier prince du sang. The couple took up residence at a home of Condé's in Saint-Jean-d'Angély in southwestern France. As part of her dowry of 20,000 écus d'or and 4 000 livres in annual allowance, Charlotte Catherine brought numerous properties into the Bourbon family which helped settle the debts of her husband's family. One year and six weeks after the wedding, Charlotte Catherine gave birth to Éléonore de Bourbon-Condé (1587-1619), who would become the Princess of Orange in 1606 upon marrying the eldest son of William the Silent. Having been wounded in battle at Coutras in September 1587, Charlotte Catherine's husband was recuperating at Saint-Jean-d'Angély when he died suddenly on 3 March 1588. An autopsy indicated he might have been poisoned and, being about three months pregnant at the time (some said, by her page, Prémilhac de Belcastel) Charlotte Catherine was deemed to have a potential motive and was arrested for murder, as was a Condé household servant by the name of Brillant who was put to death after being tortured.Mémoires de Maximilien de Béthune, duc de Sully, principal Ministre de Henri le Grand, Tome Premier, Livre Troisième, nouvelle édition, Londres, 1747; p. 275 (Fr) She gave birth in a tower of the castle at Saint-Jean-d'Angély to a son, Henri de Bourbon. Tried and condemned to death, she appealed her judgment to the Parlement de Paris but remained imprisoned under close surveillance. In 1592 the still childless and Protestant King Henry IV chose to recognise her son as his legitimate, heir presumptive and, as the child's godfather, arranged that he be christened with Huguenot rites but then promptly conducted to Saint-Germain-en-Laye Abbey to be raised as a Catholic, despite the House of Condé's Calvinism. Young Henri remained heir presumptive after the king's conversion to Catholicism in 1593 and until the birth of his son, the future Louis XIII, in 1601. After six years imprisonment Charlotte Catherine was released and, in August 1595, vindicated by the Parlement. In 1596 she abjured Calvinism, once again becoming a Catholic,Anselme, Père. ‘’Histoire de la Maison Royale de France’’, tome 4. Editions du Palais-Royal, 1967, Paris. pp. 169-170. (French). and was allowed to take up residence in Paris. There her son, the Prince de Condé, held for the remainder of his life the position of premier prince du sang, a rank henceforth retained by the Condés until claimed by the House of Bourbon- Orléans in the 18th century. Charlotte Catherine was buried at the (demolished in the 19th century) church of the Sainte-Claire de l'Ave Maria monastery (monastère Sainte-Claire de l'Ave Maria), situated not far from the Hôtel de Sens in Paris.

The restaurants are owned and operated by the Haedanghwa Group, an organization of the government of North Korea. Locations Most Pyongyang restaurants are found in China near the North Korean border, as well as Beijing and Shanghai. Since the 2000s the chain has been expanding into Southeast Asian cities including Bangkok, Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, Da Nang, Vientiane, Dhaka, Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur. There are also restaurants in Ulaanbaatar, Vladivostok, Moscow, Dubai and Kathmandu. The restaurants initially catered to the many South Korean businessmen in Southeast Asia, and have now become popular with curious tourists. The first Western outpost of the restaurant chain was opened in Amsterdam in 2012, in the residential neighborhood of Osdorp, along with Dutch co-owners. The menu and policies of this restaurant differed from its Asian counterparts. However, in September 2012, amid mutual accusations between the Korean staff and the Dutch partner, the restaurant closed. It reopened in December 2013 under the name Haedanghwa in a new location, but closed a year later. The restaurant's locations in Bangkok were temporarily shut down, but were re-opened again in 2015. Similarly, their branches in Pattaya were closed down. It was reported that a new branch was set to open in Scotland, in line with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's interest in the country after its 2014 independence referendum, although this has been denied by North Korean officials.

The restaurants serve Korean food, including kimchi dishes, Pyongyang cold noodles, barbecued cuttlefish and dog meat soup. Patrons may also buy North Korean products such as ginseng wine and an unlabelled aphrodisiac claimed to be made from bears. The prices are relatively high and in US dollars. The staff consists of young Korean women in traditional Chosŏn-ot dress, who also perform karaoke as well as song and dance routines in the style of the North Korean Mass Games for the customers. Staff from North Korea typically work on three year contracts, and are often highly trained graduates of arts colleges. Photography is generally not permitted inside. Operation According to Swedish journalist Bertil Lintner, the restaurants are one of several overseas business ventures of Room 39, a North Korean government organization dedicated to acquiring and laundering foreign currency for the North Korean leadership. North Korean defectors report that the restaurants are run by local middlemen who are required to send money every year to the North Korean government. The North Korean staff, who live on the restaurant premises, are said to be thoroughly screened for political loyalty and to be closely watched by on-site North Korean security agents. In the 2000s, according to Daily NK, several attempted escapes by waitresses in China led to the closure of several restaurants and the repatriation of their staff. In 2016, South Korea announced that 13 restaurant workers had defected from a Pyongyang restaurant chain abroad.

It was released in 1993 on Century Media Records. It is, to date, the last album to feature vocalist John Joseph. Songs on the album deal with topics such as environmentalism, anti-abortion, and spirituality. After the release of this album, the Cro-Mags had gone on hiatus for some time, experienced more lineup changes, and would not release their next album, Revenge, until seven years later. Track listing Release and reception In an AllMusic review, Vincent Jeffries said \\"The pressures of hardcore success and influence took a constant, heavy toll throughout the tumultuous history of the Cro-Mags. Shortly after releasing their first (and perhaps the hardcore genre's most important) release, The Age of Quarrel, the constant personality conflicts and lineup changes began, setting the outfit into a slow, downward, creative spiral. The mixing and matching of New York hardcore veteran musicians was unceasing, and the band never released successive discs with identical lineups. At the eye of the storm, founding member and \\"The world's first skinhead\\" Harley Flanagan hired and fired almost a dozen musicians (including himself) during the Cro-Mags' tumultuous career. Age of Quarrel vocalist John \\"Bloodclot\\" Joseph left the band before the follow-up, Best Wishes, only to join up with Flanagan years later for two releases, including Near Death Experience, giving the disc two-thirds The Age of Quarrel troika representation before another breakup led to six years of inactivity. It's often assumed that the teaming of Flanagan and Joseph was key to the band's early success, but careful credit inspection reveals guitarist Parris Mayhew's significant music-writing contributions on The Age of Quarrel and Best Wishes, clearly the Cro-Mags' best and most influential recordings. Although Flanagan and Joseph muster a little of the old-time magic, Mayhew's absence is noticeable from Near Death Experience. While the band's trademark lyrical preoccupations with urban violence and modern man's separation from nature, the past, and spirituality are fully present and accounted for, this 1993 release lumbers through too many bad metal clichés and never reaches the level of musical intensity fans of Mayhew-era recordings will expect. The already low creative standard of Near Death Experience reaches its nadir as Joseph forces some bad Steven Tyler yelping during the \\"Mr. Brownstone\\" rip-off \\"War on the Streets\\" and reaches rock bottom again during the Dokken-style metal chunking of \\"The Other Side of Madness.\\" Flanagan and company salvage a few decent tracks like the epic \\"Time I Am\\" and \\"Say Good-Bye to Mother Earth,\\" keeping Near Death Experience on rickety life support. Missing the intensity of earlier, better work, this late-career release from the legendary Cro-Mags is just a cooling ember, left over from New York's '80s hardcore fire.\\".

MChip was utilized to examine hundreds of specimens, focusing on the ability to discriminate human H1N1, human H3N2, and avian influenza (H5N1) subtypes, and resulted in high clinical sensitivity and specificity as detailed in several published studies. Other influenza A viruses of interest that have been recently examined with MChip are the 1918 ‘Spanish flu’ strain, and a variety of pandemic H1N1/09 virus specimens. InDevR Inc.

It was released in 2000 on their own label Cro-Mag Recordings, and was the band's first studio album in seven years, as well as their first release with guitarist Rocky George (formerly of Suicidal Tendencies) and its first without vocalist John Joseph since 1989's Best Wishes. As he did on Best Wishes, bassist Harley Flanagan handled the vocals on this album. Revenge was also the Cro-Mags' last full-length studio album until the release of In the Beginning in 2020. Track listing All songs written by Flanagan and Mayhew. Release and reception In an AllMusic review, Patrick Kennedy says \\"Appearing nearly a decade after the previous album, the largely disappointing Near Death Experience, Harley Flanagan resuscitated the Cro-Mags -- at least temporarily -- and issued a few albums in 2000. Revenge, a disc of studio material from the newest incarnation (also with original guitarist Parris Mayhew and Suicidal Tendencies' Rocky George), is surprisingly good hardcore. Fortunately for long-time fans, the Cro-Mags, with Harley singing in place of the deposed John Joseph, who were often considered the toughest of the New York acts, have not mellowed with age, nor followed any crossover metal/rap hybrid trends. In fact, Revenge is stone-solid, and as beefy as a slab of Angus. What's most peculiar is the sudden emergence of more melodic aspects beneath the imposing tough-guy veneer. This is melodic hardcore along the lines of early-'80s Misfits, and bears immediate sonic resemblance to Walk Among Us. Assuredly, Flanagan's vocals are menacing, which, of course, is what one would expect and probably hope for.\\".

He made his professional debut in 1973 and reached the top makuuchi division in 1981. His highest rank was sekiwake. He earned two special prizes for Technique and was a runner-up in one tournament. He retired in 1990. He is now a sumo coach and ran the Takashima stable from 1993 until 2011. He was elected to the Japan Sumo Association's board of directors in 2018. Career He came from a family of beef cattle farmers. He was a Prefectural Junior School Sumo Champion. He joined Takashima stable at the age of 15 in March 1973, recruited by former ōzeki Mitsuneyama. There were a large number of new recruits in that tournament because of a rule change. Also among them was the future top division wrestler Chikubayama. He made the juryo division in May 1981 at the age of 23. He reached the top makuuchi division for the first time in November 1981, although he was demoted back to juryo after three tournaments. In May 1982 he took part in a playoff for the juryo division championship or yusho and although he was defeated (he would never win a championship in any division) he was promoted back to the top division. He was transferred to Kumagatani stable in the same year upon the retirement of his stablemaster. He was runner-up to Chiyonofuji in July 1982, earning his first special prize for Technique. In November 1983 he won his second Technique prize and was promoted all the way from maegashira 7 to sekiwake, because of the failure of the men above him in the rankings to obtain winning records. This was to be his highest rank. He won only two bouts in this tournament and made the sanyaku ranks only one more time, at komusubi in September 1985. He struggled against the top ranked wrestlers, failing to defeat a yokozuna in 17 attempts, and beating an ozeki only twice in 35 attempts (Asashio and Hokutenyu once each). Nevertheless he was ranked in the top division for 42 straight tournaments from re-entering makuuchi in March 1983, before being finally demoted to the juryo division after the January 1990 tournament. Koboyama served regularly as the tsuyuharai to Chiyonofuji for the yokozuna's dohyo-iri ceremony, even though the two were not members of the same stable or ichimon. Retirement from sumo Kōbōyama continued to fight in the jūryō division until November 1990, when he announced his retirement after demotion to the unsalaried makushita division was certain. His top division record wa312 wins to 344 losses with 16 absences, a winning percentage of .453. He became an elder of the Japan Sumo Association, and re-established the Takashima stable in 1993. The stable closed in June 2011 when its only remaining wrestler retired, and Takashima moved to Kasugayama stable to work as a coach there. He ran for a seat on the Sumo Association's board of directors in January 2016, but was unsuccessful. After the closure of Kasugayama stable in October 2016 he moved briefly to Oitekaze stable before transferring to Miyagino stable. He won election to the board of directors in 2018. Fighting style He liked pushing and thrusting techniques. Unusually, instead of favouring a right or left hand grip he specialised in moro-zashi, or using two hands inside his opponent's arms to grab the mawashi, and was fond of the rare kimarite or technique of tottari, the arm bar throw.

He belonged to the Phagmodrupa Dynasty, which was the leading regime in Tibet between 1354 and 1435. His reign was comparatively tranquil, but he was also the last ruler of the dynasty to wield full powers over the central parts of Tibet. Accession to the throne Drakpa Gyaltsen was the eldest son of Shakya Rinchen, a brother of a former ruler of the dynasty, Jamyang Shakya Gyaltsen. His mother was called Zina Rinchen Som. His father had very briefly succeeded to the rulership of Central Tibet in 1373, but lost his mind when a house where he stayed overnight caught fire. The young Drakpa Gyaltsen was considered an incarnation of Jamyang (Manjushri, the Bodhisattva of wisdom).Giuseppe Tucci, Deb T'er Dmar Po Gsar Ma. Rome 1971, p. 214. Like the other Phagmodrupa rulers he had a monastic upbringing, and was ordained as lama of the Tsethang monastery in 1380. Five years later he was raised to the dignity of regent of Tibet by a faction opposed to the current ruler Sonam Drakpa. His maternal uncles tried to wield power from behind the throne, but were not able to maintain themselves in the face of the court ministers.Ariane Macdonald, 'Préambule à la lecture d'un Rgya-Bod yig-chan'. Journal asiatique 1963, p. 102-3. Successful reign After some time Drakpa Gyaltsen began to rule on his own. According to the Tibetan chronicles he had good physical and intellectual capabilities. Tibet made much progress in wealth and prosperity. \\"Power, fortune, and wisdom were ever attached to him.\\"Sarat Chandra Das, 'A short history of the House of Phagdu'. Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal 1905, p. 205. Apart from two brief conflicts in the Tsang region, his reign was peaceful; \\"Ü and Tsang [Central Tibet] became like one soft piece of silk\\".Giuseppe Tucci, 1971, p. 217. The ruling prince of Gyantse in Tsang, which had long guarded its autonomy, was forced to do homage to the Phagmodrupa ruler, and the prince Rabten Kunzang Phag was formally appointed treasurer.Karl-Heinz Everding, \\"Gyantse (rGyal rtse): Rise, Prime and Decline of a Tibetan Principality in the 14th-16th Centuries\\", in Volker Caumanns and Marta Sernesi (eds), Fifteenth Century Tibet: Cultural Blossoming and Political Unrest. Lumbini, 2017, p. 45. Unlike the previous rulers, who had been content with the title desi (regent), Drakpa Gyaltsen was addressed with the royal titles gongma (the high one, superior) and chogyal (saintly king).Giuseppe Tucci, 1971, p. 216-7; Tsepon W.D. Shakabpa, Tibet. A Political History. Yale 1967, pp. 85-6. He nevertheless remained a lama, and did not marry or beget children.The Mingshi alleges that Drakpa Gyaltsen in 1413 sent his son Dajie (Tashi?) with an embassy to the Yongle Emperor; see Giuseppe Tucci, Tibetan Painted Scrolls. Rome 1949, Vol. II, p. 693. This assertion, however, may be a mistake on the part of the Chinese, whose grasp of internal Tibetan affairs was sometimes vague. Relations with China The Hongwu Emperor of China heard of his accession in 1388 and conferred the title Guanding Guoshi upon him. Later, in 1406, the Ming Emperor sent a jade seal with a dragon-headed button to Drakpa Gyaltsen, together with 500 ounces of silver, three dresses of silk, flowered stuffs, fifty bolts of silk, and 200 pounds of Bashan tea. Envoys continued to be dispatched back and forth during Drakpa Gyaltsen's long reign.Giuseppe Tucci, 1949, Vol. II, p. 692-3. The king received the title wang (prince) from the Mings, as did the religious lords of Drigung, Tsedong and Ling. They were known as \\"the four wang of Tibet\\".Giuseppe Tucci, 1971, p. 215. The honorary title Chanhuawang (Prince who Expounds Buddhism) was borne by Drakpa Gyaltsen and his successors on the throne until the 17th century.Giuseppe Tucci, 1949, Vol. II, pp. 692-4. Nevertheless, the Yongle Emperor tried to obtain real ruling power over Tibet by using the Fifth Karmapa, Dezhin Shegpa (1384-1415) as a tool. The Karmapa was invited to the imperial court in 1406. He received three petitions from Drakpa Gyaltsen with a lament that \\"without an overlord there would be no protection [and] through which he offered head and body [to the emperor]\\". The Karmapa accordingly arrived to Nanjing in 1407, was received with great pomp, and accepted to be the spiritual head of Dokham (East Tibet), Central Tibet, and Rapgang. As a Tibetan pro-Karmapa report had it: \\"In brief, his kindness of having protected Tibet from the terror of Chinese warfare cannot be measured. Nevertheless, there seemed to be no one in Tibet who understood this as kindness\\". The attempt to install the Karmapa as the emperor's vassal thus failed, and the Ming emperors were henceforth content with cultivating peaceful relations with various formally dependent Tibetan hierarchs.Peter Schwieger, The Dalai Lama and the Emperor of China. New York 2105, p. 22. Religious patronage Gongma Drakpa Gyaltsen was a patron of Tsongkhapa, the well-known renovator of Tibetan Buddhism. With his endorsement, Tsongkhapa and his closest disciples were able to found the monasteries of Ganden (1409), Drepung (1416), and Sera (1419).Laurent Deshayes, Histoire du Tibet. Paris 1997, p. 120. In 1414 the gongma invited Tsongkhapa to teach the tenets of his school (later known as Gelugpa) in Drashi Dokha. A monk from Tsang called Gedun Drub attended the sermons and subsequently became a disciple of Tsongkhapa; he would later be counted as the First Dalai Lama.Ya Hanzhang, The Biographies of the Dalai Lamas. Beijing 1991, pp. 1-2, 16. In 1409 the gongma and his minister Neu Namkha Zangpo enabled Tsongkhapa to arrange the first Monlam festival in Lhasa. This three-weeks long prayer festival was subsequently held once a year and attracted many thousands of pilgrims and monks.Tsepon W.D. Shakabpa, 1967, p. 85. However, the king was not solely supportive of the Gelugpa school, but listened to a wide array of divines, including the Gelugpa's later rival Karmapa.Giuseppe Tucci, 1971, p. 216. Demise Gongma Drakpa Gyaltsen died in 1432 after 47 years on the throne. His death was only noted by the Ming court in 1440.Giuseppe Tucci, 1949, Vol. II, p. 693. At his demise he was succeeded by his nephew Drakpa Jungne, whose mother belonged to the powerful feudatory family Rinpungpa in Tsang. However, dynastic turmoil and localism among the regional lords led to a breakdown of Phagmodrupa power three years after the accession of the new king.Tsepon W.D. Shakabpa, 1967, p. 86-7.

It is entirely municipally owned, being 91% owned by the City of Edinburgh Council, with the remainder owned by Midlothian, East Lothian and West Lothian councils, although it no longer provides bus services in West Lothian. Lothian Buses plc is registered in Annandale Street, Edinburgh as company number SC096849. Origins to 1956 Several tramway companies were founded in Edinburgh in the late nineteenth century. The Edinburgh Street Tramways Company was founded in 1871, initially operating a horse-drawn tram line from Haymarket to Bernard Street in Leith, which was at that point a separate burgh from Edinburgh. This company's routes inside Edinburgh itself were taken over by Edinburgh and District Tramways in 1893, while the Leith Burgh Corporation took over those routes within their own boundaries in 1904, running them as Leith Corporation Tramways, after which Edinburgh Street Tramways ceased to trade. In 1888, Edinburgh Northern Tramways began operating cable-hauled tram services from George Street to Ferry Road and Comely Bank. They were also taken over by Edinburgh and District Tramways in 1897. The Corporation of the City of Edinburgh (then the formal name for the city council) introduced a motor bus service in July 1914.Gavin Booth, Edinburgh's Trams & Buses, 1988, page 64, This service was short lived, with the buses being requisitioned for wartime use, and services did not resume until after the First World War.Bus Results in the Scottish Capital Commercial Motor' 3 August 1926 page 14 In December 1916 the Corporation published a report they commissioned from various tram experts. Having only been tasked to report on the future of cable-trams regarding potential expansion and alternative methods of traction, it commented on the potential of the motor bus to substitute trams. It concluded that the introduction of motor buses instead of tramcars would incur a total loss of £39,425 per annum, and that the bus only had a future serving thinly populated districts, or acting as a feeder for trams. The report was heavily criticised by Commercial Motor magazine as being wholly one-sided, with fallacious assumptions, seeming to them a deliberate attempt to discredit buses. It recommended the Corporation procure independent advice from people with experience running motor buses at the necessary scale.Motorbus or Tramcar? Commercial Motor, 14 December 1916, page 1Edinburgh's Future Passenger Service Commercial Motor, 14 December 1916, page 5 In contrast to the negativity of the tram experts, bus operator the Scottish Motor Traction Company Ltd was reportedly in good financial health, being able to both \\"pay the petrol tax and to make profits in Edinburgh and district.\\" in the same year.The Wheels of Industry Commercial Motor, 4 January 1917, page 7 The City Corporation took over Edinburgh and District Tramways on 1 July 1919, forming the Edinburgh Corporation Tramways Department.G. Booth, ibid, page 64 At the same time, it began seasonal bus tour services around Holyrood Park using Leyland charabancs.http://lothianbuses.com/about-us/our-heritage/timeline Timeline Lothian Buses.comCommercial Motor, 6 April 1920, page 8 The first post-war regular bus service began on 29 December 1919, being extended the following March. The route ran between Ardmillan Terrace and Abbeyhill via Holyrood Palace, the Royal Mile and the Castle, to supplement the trams.A Triple System Of Passenger Transport, Commercial Motor, 14 February 1922, page 16 It was extended to Easter Road the following March. Edinburgh Corporation Tramways and Leith Corporation Tramways merged on 10 November 1920. By the end of 1919 the Corporation was applying for parliamentary powers to run motor buses 5 to 10 miles beyond the city boundaries.The Wheels of Industry Commercial Motor, 11 November 1919, page 4 Fares for ordinary services were charged on a graduated scale based on distance - the higher the fare (charged by the penny, 1d, 2d, etc.), the further the distance. As of early 1922, 1d bought 1,033 yards, while 5d bought 4 miles 1,170 yards. Special services in the early 1920s included football specials (requiring as many as 30 extra buses) and late night services to venues like the Marine Gardens ballroom, with the entrance fee included in the ticket.Edinburgh's Experience With Buses Commercial Motor, 10 February 1925, page 10 In the early years buses and trams also carried parcels, working with a network of collection/delivery boys, with the head office acting as a sorting office. By the end of 1920 the Corporation was considering the replacement of northern cable tram routes with buses.Commercial Motor, 14 December 1920, page 4 By the summer of 1921, the number of buses and coaches using The Mound as an interchange was causing concern for the City Magistrates.Progress In Passenger Travel, Commercial Motor, 9 August 1921, page 16 By May 1921 the department manager was already crediting the buses' contribution to the city's transport system, which at that time also comprised cable and electric trams, for preventing rate relief being necessary. By early 1922 buses had replaced a quarter of the cable-tram network (approx. 6.2 miles).A Lothian (Mac Tours) open top bus on a victory parade for Heart of Midlothian F.C. In 1922 there were bus garages in Shrubhill, which had capacity for 53 vehicles, and Henderson Row, which held up to 45. In 1926, the bus fleet moved into Central Depot on Annandale Street, a former Industrial Exhibition hall, which is still Lothian Buses' main depot today.Lothian Buses Timeline Hoping for economies of scale, originally all of the Corporation's road transport fleet (including such vehicles as fire tenders and waste collection vehicles) were to be garaged in this depot. In the period of 1920–5, the experience of running buses at high frequency (every 3 mins) on busy city routes to temporarily replace cable trams exposed the early designs' weaknesses - the vibration issues (particularly bad due to Edinburgh's paved streets), the low capacity and narrow doors in comparison to trams, and the fact that, despite their speed advantage between stops, longer load/unload times often meant they were slower overall. In some cases, the buses were so unpopular they were removed and replaced with electric trams. On the other hand, they were showing their usefulness in other areas. Because of this, by 1925 the department's manager was of the opinion that trams should still be used for the heaviest and busiest loadings, but never for new routes with a frequency less than 6 per hour, while buses would still remain employed on routes either complementing or connecting existing tram lines, or on routes that were unsuitable or uneconomic for trams. He nonetheless advocated for the bus as a necessary part of new housing developments such as Lochend, where revenue growth over time was evident, and considered the vibration issue solved since the introduction of pneumatic tyres. He concluded that as both modes are so inter-dependent, they \\"should be considered as a single transport organization for the city.\\"Bus Results in Scottish Cities Commercial Motor, 4 August 1925, page 10 The effect of motor bus tyres (which at that time were solid rubber) on the road surface was an early issue. Reimbursement for repairing the damage to the roads in Holyrood Park by the tour charabancs was laid down as a condition of operating there in the 1921 season. In 1921 the city deputy surveyor found that no undue damage was being done by buses on tarmacked roads, with some not damaged at all, but water-bound macadam surfaces and sett paving without concrete underlay were vulnerable to rutting and other issues.The Wheels of Industry Commercial Motor, 9 August 1921, page 4 On one hilly route, after residents complained of vibration caused by the buses, various remedies were deployed - limiting the speed to 8 mph, descent in gear, and the fitting of super-cushion tyres (Dunlop and North British). The 8 mph limit was also necessary in granite paved sections of running, which were extensive in Edinburgh. This record of the early introduction of buses was hailed by Commercial Motor magazine in the mid 1920s as a sign of the Edinburgh authority's foresight in recognising \\"the part which the motorbus was destined ultimately to play in the solution of the passenger transport problems of the age\\", contrasting it with Glasgow Corporation which, despite having twice the population of Edinburgh, had only begun bus services in December 1924. In the early 1920s, batch by batch reliability of buses could be unpredictable and often required running adjustments. The combination the build quality of early AEC vehicles and the professionalism of the Corporation's garage staff produced in-service mileage figures and engine life that Commercial Motor praised as \\"exceptionally good\\".Remarkable Motorbus Performances, Commercial Motor, 30 October 1923, page 30 Measures taken included mandatory defect reporting by drivers at the end of each shift, a preventative maintenance regime which called for inspection/repairs every 10 days (with the spare parts inventory including complete engines) with close monitoring of parts usage, and an overhaul/repaint cycle of every 18 months. In order to improve the system, the Corporation was performing its own modifications to buses as early as 1921, experimenting with a new type of rear shock absorber using rubber pads on one of its Leylands, and widening the doors of buses during overhaul. Examples of in-house innovation included portable bus electrics testing apparatus in 1932Wheels of Industry, Commercial Motor, 26 April 1932, page 48 and the establishment in the 1940s of a soap making plant inside the Laundry at Shrubhill Depot, in response to the need for a soap which didn't damage vehicle paintwork.Edinburgh Transport Has Its Own Laundry, Commercial Motor, 6 September 1940, page 41 All horse and cable operated trams on the network were fully electrified by 1923. By 1926 there were 12 regular bus routes, with a total mileage of 43, and working to Bath Street, Blackford, Bonnington, Cameron Toll, Colinton, Cramond, Easter Road, Juniper Green, Hillend, Lochend, Newcraighall, Portobello and Surgeon's Hall. The average number of passengers per mile was just under 9, with the average fare at around 1.6d. Good loadings on an experimental night service run from October 1925 to April 1926 saw the Corporation make plans to introduce regular winter night services. In the 1920s, the average speed of the bus fleet approached, and then surpassed, that of the trams. The change occurred some time in the window of the 1927/8 financial year - in the space of this period the average speed of the buses went from 8.25 mph to 9.5 mph, in contrast to the trams, which went from 8.5 mph to 8.76 mph.Bus Results in Scottish Cities, Commercial Motor, 7 August 1928, page 53 In 1928, given the increasing importance of buses, the Edinburgh Corporation Tramways Department was renamed the Edinburgh Corporation Transport Department.G. Booth, ibid, page 64 In 1928, the Corporation introduced measures to ensure bus operators could not undercut trams, by insisting one-way fares on routes duplicating trams must be at least 1d (one penny) higher, and that other forms of ticketing must not be cheaper than equivalent tram travel.Wheels of Industry, Commercial Motor, 12 June 1928, page 42 Edinburgh was one of many corporation transport systems in the UK that began employing female conductors in large numbers during the Second World War. Edinburgh Corporation's tram network was abandoned between 1950 and 1956.  1956 to present  LRT Leyland Olympian on route 86 in Edinburgh, 1994 In 1975, under the local government reorganisation which followed the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, ownership of Edinburgh Corporation Transport passed to the Lothian Regional Council's Department of Public Transport. The operation was duly renamed Lothian Regional Transport. The Transport Act 1985 deregulated bus services in Great Britain and required that municipal bus operations be run as commercial companies rather than as public service departments. Therefore, on 26 October 1986 the operation became Lothian Region Transport plc, better known by its initials 'LRT', a company wholly owned by Lothian Regional Council. In May 1989, a private company called Guide Friday set up an open top bus tour called the Edinburgh Tour. Later that year, LRT set up the Classic Tour using open top Leyland Atlanteans as a direct competitor - Edinburgh Corporation and LRT had operated tour services since the early 1920s, but with weaker branding. The Classic Tour buses wore a blue and white livery, each carrying a name e.g.Scottish Star, Lothian Star and Highland Star.Fotopic collection of the Edinburgh Classic Tour fleetFotopic collection of the Edinburgh Classic Tour fleet On 1 April 1996 Lothian Regional Council was abolished. Although the then Conservative government had sought to have the company privatised, this was resisted by local politicians and ownership the company passed to the new City of Edinburgh Council and the three neighbouring councils. The LRT identity remained until January 2000, when the company was renamed Lothian Buses plc, the LRT logo changing to 'Lothian'. In July 2000 Lothian Buses became one of the first bus tour operators to join the City Sightseeing franchise model, re- branding and upgrading the Classic Tour. Lothian purchased the first purpose built low flow open top buses, painted in City Sightseeing livery. The Classic tour was completely transformed into the City Sightseeing red scheme by May 2001.City Sightseeing news page In 2002, Lothian Buses acquired both Guide Friday, its biggest rival in the tour bus market, and the smaller Mac Tours, which had been founded in 1998 and operated vintage bus tours - this Left Lothian Buses as the only tour bus operator in the city. All three tour brands were consolidated as one subsidiary company; Edinburgh Bus Tours. In 2004, Edinburgh Bus Tours introduced the Majestic Tour, visiting the Royal Yacht Britannia and the Botanic Gardens. Post deregulation Lothian experienced alternating periods of competition and stability with the other major bus operator in Edinburgh, First in Edinburgh (First), and its previous incarnations SMT/Eastern Scottish. During this time Lothian acquired a number of smaller Edinburgh operators. In 2001, Lothian alleged anti-competitive practises by First.Bus wars to be investigatedBus firm hits back over 'fares war' This claim was later rejected. Other operators such as Stagecoach Fife, E&M; Horsburgh, Perryman's Buses and MacEwans also operate stage services into Edinburgh, but as these tend to be long-distance routes or subsidised local services they are not generally a competitive threat. One lasting effect of competition was the extension of Lothian services beyond the City of Edinburgh boundaries, in response to incursion by Eastern into Edinburgh city services. However, Lothian subsequently withdrew from West Lothian, leaving this area to First, with the sole exception of a night bus service between Longstone depot and Livingston which is operated primarily for the use of staff who live in West Lothian. Although this service is not widely advertised to the public, they are permitted to use this service. Withdrawal from this area and not the others that Lothian extended into has caused concern amongst residents who had experienced low fares and greater choice of services during the period when Lothian and Eastern Scottish were competing. During the time in which it was not served by Lothian Buses, West Lothian Council remained a shareholder of the company.Bus travellers' fury over fares increase In 2014, Lothian Buses began to again serve to the historical area of the county after taking over a contracted service to South Queensferry and Kirkliston.South Queensferry back on bus map after 30 years The Scotsman However, these towns are located in the City of Edinburgh council area under present-day municipal boundaries. In 2005 the drivers of Lothian Buses plc staged official and wildcat strikes over pay.Bus drivers accept pay offer In some cases this resulted in passengers being abandoned as buses were taken out of service by drivers.New talks bid after drivers' wildcat strike Lothian Buses set up a subsidiary company in December 2006 to operate a taxibus service to and from Edinburgh Airport, and so fill a gap in the airport transport market between conventional bus services and taxis.Edinburgh airport shuttle to be launched - airport parking news In September 2007 it was investigated by the Traffic Commissioner for selling illegal fares.Shuttle faces probe into \\"illegal fares\\" - Edinburgh Evening News 13 September 2007 Despite this it was extended to serve Leith, Ocean Terminal and Cameron Toll from October 2007. The vehicles used were Ford Transits. However, in February 2009 it was announced that the operation was up for sale as it had been operating at a loss despite carrying over 88,000 passenger in 2008. A buyer was not found and the operation was closed down in April 2009.Holyrood Magazine - Increased Demand On 15 August 2013, the City of Edinburgh Council announced the creation of Transport for Edinburgh, a new public body meant to oversee public transport in Edinburgh, including both buses and the new tram system. Transport convener for Edinburgh Council Lesley Hinds stated: \\"Our first priority will be integration between bus and tram services and we will have the executive directors of Lothian Buses on the board of the new organisation\\".BBC News - Transport for Edinburgh: New body to oversee trams and buses Fleet History Alexander bodied Leyland Olympian in the last version of the traditional madder and white livery Edinburgh Corporation and Lothian have historically employed a high degree of standardisation of their service bus fleet, to facilitate maintenance savings. Double-deckers have long made up the majority of the fleet. Buses have generally been purchased new - relatively few secondhand vehicles have been operated. From 1969 until 2001 Lothian favoured dual-door vehicles, which minimised loading times by allowing simultaneous boarding (at the front door) and alighting (from the rear door). With the exception of those bought for the Airlink service, all new double-deckers bought in this period had dual-doors, as did the Leyland National and Lynx saloons. However, in 2002 a decision was made to purchase single door vehicles only, apparently to stop fraudulent lawsuits claiming that the driver closed the rear doors while they were exiting.Scotsman.com News - Bus chiefs slam the door on fraudsters and fare dodgers from Edinburgh Evening News 22 June 2005 There is an ongoing programme of converting earlier low-floor dual-door vehicles to single door. =Early Vehicles= In 1919, Edinburgh Corporation bought their first Leyland charabancs, for tour services. The Corporation was authorised to purchase 30 more buses in early 1920 for £25,000.A Scottish Development, Commercial Motor, 3 February 1920, page 7 By the middle of 1920, the Corporation had around 60 Leyland buses in service or on order. Of these orders, a 33-seat 'Edinburgh type' single-decker bus body with rear door and a separate smoking compartment at the back, mounted on a 4-ton 36-40 hp Model O chassis with worm drive axle, was exhibited at trade shows during the year, the Darlington Royal Show in June and the Commercial Motor Show at Kensington Olympia in October.The Darlington Royal Show, Commercial Motor, 22 June 1920, page 23Further Models for Olympia, Commercial Motor, 5 October 1920, page 10 This body type, in which the driver also had his own compartment, was already reportedly well- known and popular by 1921. One reason for the complete enclosure of the driver was to increase protection against the weather, which in Edinburgh could be considerably cold. Some of the earlier rear entrance buses had narrow doors, which slowed down boarding/alighting. As a result, these were widened during overhaul. By early 1922, two Edinburgh type buses were in service with a centre door layout, i.e. between the axles. Featuring a wide door with a central hand rail, and signage directing passengers to board on the right of it and alight on the left, early indications were that this not only speeded up boarding/alighting, it increased the space available for standees. By 1925, the Edinburgh type had further evolved to feature two doors, front and rear, albeit reduced to 31 seats. It was also now being fitted to 45 hp AEC chassis. The early Edinburgh type buses required a driver and conductor to operate, but on lesser used routes, one-man-operation was also employed - for a 10 percent increase in wages the rear door would be closed and the driver would collect fares on boarding via the front. The early AEC and Leyland buses were reportedly up to the challenging task of route service in Edinburgh, which, due to its hilly terrain, was hard on engines, gears and brakes. To save on clutches, the AECs came with ratchet sprags fitted to the rear wheels (initially wire controlled, later modified to rod-control), with drivers instructed to deploy them at the bottom of hills. Because the charabanc motor coaches were not in use in the winter months, some would be re-fitted with single-deck bus bodies and put into route service, while some of the remaining charabancs would be used in route service in case of extreme need. During the tram electrification programme, some were refitted with truck bodies to assist the works. The first double-decker buses (open top, rear staircase layout) arrived in 1922. Although growing in size both before and after, for the period of May 1925 to May 1926 the fleet size was static at a total of 88 buses in regular use, as follows: * 71 single-deckers of the 31-seat Edinburgh body type (41 Leylands, 40 AECs) * 2 double-deckers (54 seaters) * 15 charabancs (nine 27-seaters, six 32-seaters) During 1924 nearly half the fleet were converted to use pneumatic tyres (Dunlop & Michelin) instead of the earlier solid rubber or later Supercushion designs; by 1925 the Corporation had already determined based on both direct (price, life) and indirect (vibration damage, fuel consumption) cost comparisons, as well as the increased passenger comfort, to use them on the entire fleet. The issue of vibration was particularly serious in Edinburgh to the prevalence of granite paved streets. Conversion presented difficulty on the rear twin tyres on the AEC Model 507 double-deckers due to the maximum legal width (7' 6\\"), but this was overcome with in-house modifications.Edinburgh and its bus services, Commercial Motor, 24 May 1927, page 86 In 1926 the Corporation had four 52 seat double-deckers on order from AEC.Recent AEC Orders, Commercial Motor, 30 March 1926, page 6 To further solve the problem of lost time loading/unloading, by 1927 the corporation was stipulating two door bus bodies with wider doors, allowing simultaneous boarding and alighting - in through the rear (being at least 32' wide), and out through the front (28'). The presence of low bridges on almost all of the city routes implemented by 1927 prevented the use of double-deckers, and so attention turned to 6-wheeled single-deckers to meet the needs for extra capacity in rush hour. A batch of six such vehicles were bought from Karrier Motors, bodied by Hall, Lewis and Co. Designated the Type WL6/1, the chassis was the mandated maximum 30' length, but specially built with a longer 19' wheelbase to meet the requirement for comfortably seating 39. A 61-80 hp six-cylinder engine powered single tyres on both rear axle, with air pressure braking applying on all four driving wheels. These were half-cab buses, with the driver sitting in his own compartment to the front, beside the engine. The two doors were automatically controlled by the driver. A smoking area was still in use - achieved by a division in the body, with 17 smokers sitting in the rear section. The interior featured bucket seats, upholstered in green leather, with generous leg room.Six-wheeled buses for municipal use, Commercial Motor, 23 August 1927, page 58 Comparative trials of the six-wheelers with the shorter single- deckers on the East Road had shown that, based on a working life of 8 years, the increased revenues generated by the larger buses offset the increased capital, licensing and petrol costs. This led to eight more being ordered.More Buses for Important Scottish Municipalities, Commercial Motor, 1 November 1927, page 45 Having recognised the advantages of operating modern buses, by 1928 the Corporation was already practicing the art of fleet replacement - with new deliveries displacing older buses which would then be disposed of. =1930s= By May 1930 the fleet totalled 130 buses and coaches, the most recent arrivals being 14 AEC Reliance 95 hp 32 seater single decker buses of the \\"most modern\\" design. Dual-doored, the front was Simplex pneumatically controlled. The interior featured oak panelling throughout, Induroleum floor covering, chrome fittings, a Holt patent heater, and the bucket type leather upholstered seats. There was still a rear smoker's compartment, now just seating 10.Bus Results in the Scottish Capital, Commercial Motor, 30 July 1929, page 59 In 1932, the Corporation began trials to determine the fuel efficiency gains in using tar-oil mixed with petrol as a fuel, on petrol engined buses. This involved modifying a number of Leyland and AECs to use the Solex bi-fuel system, while a bespoke method was used on Daimlers.Tar-oil Experiments In Edinburgh, Commercial Motor, 6 January 1933, page 45 By May 1934, Daimlers made up nearly half the fleet, which now totalled 152 buses and coaches.Operating Aspects Of Passenger Transport, Commercial Motor, 27 July 1934, page 58 =Double Deckers= In the period immediately following the Second World War, the Guy Arab and Daimler CV-series were favoured, with a smaller number of AEC Regent III. Between 1952 and 1966 some 452 Leyland Titan PD2 and PD3 were delivered (notably including 300 PD2s with MCCW Orion bodies in 1954-56 for tram replacement). With the move to rear-engined double- deckers, 588 Leyland Atlantean with Alexander bodies joined the fleet between 1965 and 1981. With the demise of the Atlantean, the standard bus was the Leyland Olympian double decker with Eastern Coach Works or Alexander RH-type bodies (296 between 1982 and 1993). After the purchase of Leyland Bus by Volvo, Lothian remained loyal to the Volvo Olympian chassis, taking 134 with Alexander RH and Royale type bodies between 1994 and 1997. These were the last step-entrance buses purchased. 95 years of continuous Leyland operation with Lothian and its predecessors ended on 14 March 2009 with the withdrawal of the last Leyland Olympians. Subsequently, low floor double-deckers have been specified. Initially the Dennis Trident 2 was favoured, with 197 being purchased between 1999 and 2004, of which first five had Alexander ALX400 bodies and the remainder Plaxton President bodywork (including four built new as open-toppers). Six Volvo B7TL with Plaxton President bodies were purchased for comparison in 2000, along with a similar bus which had started life as a manufacturer's demonstrator. Subsequently, most new vehicles have been Volvos with Wrightbus bodywork, comprising 125 Volvo B7TL/Wright Eclipse Gemini (2005–07), 100 Volvo B9TL/Wright Eclipse Gemini (2007–09), 135 Volvo B9TL/Wright Eclipse Gemini 2 (2009–11), 25 Volvo B5TL/Wright Eclipse Gemini 2 (2014), 40 Volvo B5LH/Wright Eclipse Gemini 3 hybrids (2015–17) and 132 Volvo B5TL/Wright Eclipse Gemini 3 (2015–18), including 30 built as open toppers and 8 delivered new to the East Coast Buses unit. In addition to the Volvos, a Scania OmniDekka demonstrator was delivered in 2004 for long term evaluation, and although it was subsequently returned to the manufacturer it did lead to the purchase of 15 Scania OmniCity in 2006–07. Two of these were later converted to open toppers for the East Coast Buses unit. Another non-standard batch of buses are 15 Alexander Dennis Enviro400H hybrids delivered in 2011, although these have since been converted to full diesel operation. Secondhand Volvo/Wright double deckers dating from 2010-12 were purchased in 2018–19 to allow expansion of the Lothian Country operation, enable withdrawal of the last Tridents and Scanias, and accelerate replacement of early B7TLs with newer, lower-emission versions. These comprise 4 B5LH Gemini 3 from Bullock of Cheadle, and 70 B9TL Gemini 2 from various London fleets (including 6 open- toppers). All of these are readily distinguishable from their \\"native\\" contemporaries by virtue of being shorter wheelbase models. The newest double deckers in the fleet (as of summer 2020) are 77 Volvo B8L(T) Alexander Dennis Enviro400 XLB tri-axle double deckers delivered during 2019. =Single Deckers= Post-war single-deckers comprised small batches of Guy Arab, Daimler CV-series, Crossley SD42, Bristol L-type, Leyland Royal Tiger and Olympic, and Albion Aberdonian. In 1959–60, some 100 Leyland Tiger Cubs with Weymann bodies were purchased to replace the assorted front engined single- deckers. In 1961 a solitary Leyland Leopard was delivered. This was number 101 (registered YSG101), which was notable as a very early example (in the UK) of a 36' long bus, for carrying the second ever example of Alexander's long- running Y-type body, and for being completed to an experimental standee layout with three sets of doors. In 1966 the removal of disused railway bridges on Easter Road enabled the busy Leith circular services to be converted to double-deck operation. Many of the Tiger Cubs were sold to Ulsterbus, and the single-deck fleet declined markedly. No more large single-deckers were purchased until 1975, when twelve more Y-type Leopards (to a more conventional specification) were purchased, and ten 1974 Bedford YRTs with similar bodies to coach specification were downgraded to service buses after only 1 season. Twenty dual-door Leyland Nationals arrived in 1982–85, followed by 12 dual- door Leyland Lynx in 1991. Later, some reconditioned secondhand Leyland Nationals were purchased for use on tendered services. Since the move to low- floor buses the number of single deckers in the fleet has increased. After operating a Volvo B10L demonstrator on long-term loan, 91 Dennis/Plaxton Super Pointer Dart were purchased in 2000–2003. Subsequently, Volvos were adopted as standard, with 66 new Volvo B7RLE/Wright Eclipse Urban (2004–08), 2 similar secondhand vehicles purchased from Whitelaw of Stonehouse in 2011, 24 new Volvo B7RLE/Wright Eclipse 2 (2009–13), and 50 Volvo B5LH 7900H hybrids in 2013–14. These deliveries allowed the withdrawal of the Super Pointer Darts, since which time the single deck fleet has been 100% Volvo in its composition. The need for additional single deckers for the East Coast Buses subsidiary led to the purchase of another 7 secondhand Volvo B7RLE/Wright Eclipse Urban from Arriva Southern Counties in 2016, followed by 15 new Volvo B8RLE/Wright Eclipse 3 in 2017. =Midibuses= Minibuses and short wheelbase midibuses have not been used in large numbers by Lothian, although some midibuses had previously been used on less busy routes. Ten Seddon Pennine IV-236 were acquired in 1973. These were replaced by 18 Leyland Cubs with Duple Dominant bodies in 1981, which in turn gave way to 12 9m Dennis Darts with Alexander Dash bodies in 1992. When the Darts were delivered they were the only non- Leyland vehicles in the fleet. In 2001 five of these Darts were sold to Yorkshire Traction. The ones that remained were gradually cascaded to the Mac Tours subsidiary until their replacement by six Optare Solo SRs in 2008. The Solos were in turn replaced by six Wright StreetAir EV DF electric buses in 2017. =Coaches= Until the early 2000s, Lothian and its predecessors operated a small coach fleet. Until 1976 most coaches were lightweight types (mainly Bedfords), but subsequently 10 Leyland Leopard, 14 Leyland Tiger and 7 Dennis Javelin were purchased up to 1999. An oddity (in that it was an import in what was at the time a 100% British fleet) was a Toyota Coaster minicoach, new in 1993. The original coach operation was closed down in order to concentrate on stage services and the open top sightseeing tours. In 2018 Lothian returned to the coach business with the launch of the Lothian Motor Coaches unit, based at its own depot in Newbridge. New coaches for this unit have been five tri-axle Volvo B11R(T) / Plaxton Panther 3 and a pair of Mercedes-Benz Sprinter minicoaches in 2018, and six two-axle B11R / Panther 3s in 2019. In addition various secondhand Volvos were purchased to build up the fleet, comprising (as of summer 2020) one Volvo B12M / Plaxton Paragon, one B12B / Van Hool Acron T9, four tri-axle B12B(T) / Acrons, two similar B13RT / Acrons and six B9R / Caetano Levante. The Levantes were only used for the 2019 summer season. The Lothian Motor Coaches unit also operates some Volvo B9TL / Wright Eclipse Gemini double-deckers cascaded from the bus fleet. Expansion of the Lothian Country operations in West Lothian in 2019 saw the purchase of 8 new Volvo B8R / Plaxton Leopard interurban coaches for express services. Main fleet liveries & route branding A now-withdrawn Leyland Olympian in traditional madder and white livery in 2006 Traditionally, Edinburgh Corporation, Lothian Regional Transport and Lothian Buses had a livery of madder (a dark red) and cream (white), with matching madder leatherette seating. In the 1920s the livery, as seen on the Hall bodied Karrier Type WL6/1 six-wheelers on delivery, was maroon, with a cream band under the windows, with white window surrounds and a black roof. The fleetname was 'Corporation Motors', applied on the cream band. Some coach-seated Leyland Olympian / Alexander RH-types and Volvo Olympian / Alexander Royales had been painted in the same scheme, but with red in place of the madder. These vehicles are not branded for, but were typically found only on, routes 15/15A. While Lothian had traditionally maintained a uniform livery for all buses, deliveries of low floor vehicles has seen a new standard livery introduced. Low floor vehicles have also seen route branding come to be increasingly used by Lothian. Route branding highlights the route of certain services making the buses easier to be spotted throughout Edinburgh and the Lothians. In 1999–2000, a new \\"harlequin\\" livery was introduced for all new vehicle deliveries, comprising all-over white, with madder lower skirting with a thin red separating stripe and a red front-panel. Gold and madder overlapping diamonds were added to the rear quarters and the rear of the vehicle. The red front serves to distinguish approaching Lothian vehicles from the all-over white of First in Edinburgh. The livery was simplified in 2002 with the diamonds originating from a different position and no longer overlapping each other. This new livery was intended to highlight the low floor accessible nature of these buses and also benefits from being more durable than the madder paint through the life of the bus. The harlequin livery was not retrospectively applied to older vehicles in the fleet, with the Alexander Royale bodied Olympians the last vehicles to be delivered in the traditional madder and white scheme and when these vehicles were withdrawn in 2009 this livery left the Lothian fleet also. However it was announced in March 2010 that the traditional Madder Rose and White Livery was to be reintroduced across the 600 strong fleet.Lothian Buses introduces traditional look for new livery  TXNews  Transport News The vehicles will be repainted as part of their ongoing maintenance, so the old \\"harlequin\\" livery will continue to be a common sight on Edinburgh's streets. Originally, twelve buses had been branded for route 35 but in November 2007 a similar number of buses, ten ex-Airlink and two from the 2004 delivery of Tridents, were branded for the 35. This featured a purple circle with the name \\"Airport-Holyrood-Government Link\\" and a route description on the sides above the purple circle. Certain single deckers have extra branding promoting the Nightbus network. From time to time, some buses will have wraparound advertising applied, either to the whole bus, an entire side or the entire rear of the bus. Ridacards are advertised on the entire side of older Olympians. Previously, services 22 and 30 were branded but with the 22 converted to double-deck operation on 18 January 2009, this service lost the branding. The 30 also lost its branding, as the Dennis Darts used on it were replaced by cascaded Volvo B7RLE's from the 22 service. Finances The first route (1919) initially generated and average revenue of £35 a day. This had risen to £150 on this one route by 1921, thanks to increasing the frequency and length. This particular route could even reach £260 on Saturdays due to football crowds, passing as it did the grounds of the city's two top clubs, Hearts and Hibs. Working on a financial year ending in May, the corporation bus fleet recorded net profits from 1921 to 1923, with a high of over £21.1k in 1922 being followed by a low of £8.5k in 1923. One factor affecting Edinburgh's finances is the above-average fuel consumption of the fleet, which is due to the hilly terrain. Having nearly reached 20m in 1923/4, the number of bus passengers carried in 1924/5 dropped back to 15.5m after The Mound and Hanover Street route was converted from bus operation to electric trams. By May 1925, the Corporation had 88 buses in regular use. Despite the size, and after a total capital expenditure of nearly £200,000 on buses and garages (of which around three-quarters had already been paid off), they now returned an annual loss of £8,174 on revenues of £109,400, although the loss included the cost of converting half the fleet to pneumatic tyres (without which, the loss would have been £1,357). By 1926 passenger numbers had increased to 17.2m, bringing the bus fleet back into profit, albeit just £1,933. A challenge presented itself in 1935 with the combination of rising fuel price rises and oil duty increases meaning the Corporation would add an extra £9,500 a year in costs.

Like his brother, Baring was involved in the family banking business, beginning his career in the Liverpool office of Barings Bank. He later moved to New York City to join Kidder Peabody. When, in 1890, Kidder Peabody split its dual Boston-New York firm, Baring became a partner in the separated New York firm. He and another Kidder-Peabody alumnus, George C.

Following the near-collapse of Barings, which initiated the Panic of 1890, and the death of senior partner \\"T.

The Security Council condemned the violence and many killings of civilians in Rwanda and the impunity with which armed people were able to operate. The importance of the Arusha Accords signed in Arusha, Tanzania, was stressed and for all parties to commitment to its implementation, commending the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) for its efforts in this regard. The Council stated that the thousands of deaths and large number of refugees and displaced people constituted a major humanitarian crisis with large scale violations of international humanitarian law. In this context the Council regarded the killing of members of an ethnic group with the intention of destroying such a group a crime punishable under international law. All parties were urged to cease incitement of ethnic hatred, particularly through the mass media. The Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was requested to collect information regarding the shooting down of the plane carrying the President of Rwanda Juvénal Habyarimana and President of Burundi Cyprien Ntaryamira and violations of international humanitarian law. The urgent need for co-ordinated international action to alleviate the suffering of the Rwandan people was underlined, therefore it was desirable that the mandate of UNAMIR peacekeepers was expanded for humanitarian reasons. Concerned that the continuation of the situation constituted a threat to international peace and security, the Council demanded an immediate end to hostilities, an agreed ceasefire and an end to the violence and carnage engulfing Rwanda. With this in mind, the mandate of UNAMIR was expanded to include: :(a) to contribute to the safety of displaced persons and refugees, and the establishment of secure humanitarian areas; :(b) to provide security during the distribution of humanitarian aid. It was recognised that UNAMIR may also need to act in self- defense against persons threatening protected sites and populations and humanitarian workers, and authorised an increase of the force level of UNAMIR up to 5,500 troops. This would be an increased from the 444 already present. The Secretary-General had called for the redeployment of military observers currently in Nairobi, Kenya to Rwanda and to bring the mechanised infantry battalion up to full strength. He was also asked to report on developments in the situation concerning progress towards a ceasefire, availability of resources, the UNAMIR mandate and review of further action. Member States were requested to provide personnel to UNAMIR, while the parties in Rwanda were urged to co-operate with its mandate, ensuring its safety and freedom of movement and to treat Kigali International Airport as a neutral zone. The Council, now acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, went on to impose an arms embargo on Rwanda, banning the sale of weapons, ammunition, military vehicles and equipment, police equipment and spare parts to the country. A Committee of the Security Council was established with the following tasks: :(a) to seek information from Member States on actions they had taken to implement the embargo; :(b) to consider information on violations of the embargo and discuss ways of increasing the effectiveness of the embargo; :(c) to recommend measures against violations. The Secretary-General was further asked as soon as possible to report on violations of humanitarian law, and in cooperation with the OAU, to continue its efforts for a peaceful solution within the Arusha peace agreement. Finally, the Council decided to keep the situation under review and anticipated a report from the Secretary- General within five weeks of the adoption of the current resolution on developments in Rwanda.

Bloomberg, Winton Replaces Moore Among Top 20 Hedge Funds as Managed Futures Advance, Retrieved July 2011 In September 2018, MCM had $10.2 billion in total assets under management. History MCM was founded in 1989 by American billionaire Louis Moore Bacon. He launched the fund using a $25,000 inheritance from his mother. MCM's first investor was Antoine Bernheim, president of Dome Capital Management, who in 1990 accounted for $1.5 million of MCM's initial $1.8 million in assets and redeemed his investment in 2009. In 2008, MCM let nervous investors redeem $5 billion in shares despite decent performance. In 2009 MCM launched two new funds; Moore Emerging Equity Long/Short Fund and Moore Emerging Fixed Income and Currency Fund. The company also offered incentives for new investors in other funds. In 2010, British regulators arrested Moore Capital Management employee Julian Rifat for allegedly participating in illegal insider trading. The arrest was in connection with Rifat trading from personal accounts, not from Moore Capital Management funds. In April of that year, MCM paid $48.425 million to settle charges brought against it by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission(CFTC) which accused MCM of manipulating settlement prices for Nymex platinum and palladium futures contracts. In August 2013 MCM paid $48.4 million to settle a class action lawsuit in relation to the platinum and palladium manipulation claims. As of June 2018, its main fund, Moore Global Investors, has posted an annualized return of 15.8% since inception. On November 21, 2019, Louis Bacon announced that he is planning to shutter Moore Capital's funds and return capital to investors with the primary reasons being the disappointing results of the fund over the last couple of years along with the intensified competition which had put enormous pressure on the firm’s profitability which ultimately led to a challenging business environment. According to an investor letter released by the firm, Moore's will continue to invest through the fund similar to Tam Capital LP. Additionally, after returning outside money, the Moore Global Investments, Remington Investment Strategies and Moore Macro Advisors will be consolidated into a single proprietary fund. Business model MCM is characterized as a global macro investor, utilizing macroeconomic themes, cash, futures and derivatives in its portfolios. Bacon, its founder, participates in most of the global markets, basing his moves on his evaluation of the future trends of inflation, economic growth, central bank policy and national politics. He then determines what themes and investments to play based on data from his strategists and researchers.

It is one of the ninety Ahar- Banas culture sites located in the Basins of the Banas river and its tributaries. The excavations at Balathal produced evidence as to the origin of the early farming community of Central India and brought about traces of early urbanization.  Excavation  The archaeological site, located 6 km from Vallabhnagar town and 42 km from Udaipur city. It was discovered by V. N. Misra during a survey in 1962-63. It was excavated from 1994 to 2000, jointly by the Department of Archaeology of the Deccan College Post-graduate and Research Institute, Pune and the Institute of Rajasthan Studies, Rajasthan Vidyapeeth, Udaipur under the direction of V. N. Misra of the Deccan College.[1] Balathal is one of the important sites in Mewar region of Rajasthan. The extensive excavations carried out at the site have produced vast amounts of data. There were various ethnobotanical remains recovered at Balathal and these include wheat, barley, Indian jujube, okra, and Job's tears as well as several varieties of millet, lentils, and peas. The excavated remains also included domesticated animals such as sheep, goat, and cattle. Archaeologists also discovered several burial sites where the earliest evidence of leprosy in South Asia was found. This was identified in the remains of an adult male buried sometime between 2500 and 2000 B.C. Balathal was occupied during two cultural periods: the Chalcolithic and the Early Historic.  Chalcolithic phase  Chalcolithic Period (3000-1500 B.C.), also referred to as the Ahar culture is characterized partially by its well-planned structures. For example, buildings had multiple rooms, with structures servings varying functions. Evidence from this era that was found includes clay, stone, shell, and copper objects, as well as floral and animal remains. Some of the pottery from Balathal was locally produced, while other types found at Balathal came from other sites in the Ahar-Banas Complex. This, and other, evidence show that the chalcolithic communities traded and exchanged materials with other contemporary communities, which may have included settlements like Harappan in Gujarat. Available data suggest that Balathal was a well-fortified settlement and underwent a period of economic development and then a decline. This decline entailed a decrease in population and corresponded with the rise of a contemporary Harappan (Indus) civilization.  Early Historic phase  After the Chalcolithic phase, Balathal was abandoned for a long time until the Early Historic phase (500-200 B.C.) of the site’s activity. It was discovered that there was a cultural vacuum that persisted from five to six centuries. This new settlement already had the knowledge of iron, which enabled the inhabitants to establish agriculture practice and production. The excavated artifacts, which included tools such as plows, sickles, knives, spades, hoes, and adzes, among others, revealed that the settlement already produced crops twice a year.

Cdc14 is found in most of the eukaryotes. Cdc14 was defined by Hartwell in his famous screen for loci that control the cell cycle of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cdc14 was later shown to encode a protein phosphatase. Cdc14 is dual-specificity, which means it has serine/threonine and tyrosine-directed activity. A preference for serines next to proline is reported. Many early studies, especially in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, demonstrated that the protein plays a key role in regulating late mitotic processes. However, more recent work in a range of systems suggests that its cellular function is more complex.  Cellular function  In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the species in which Cdc14 activity is best understood and most-studied, the activity of Cdc14 (ScCdc14) leads to mitotic exit by dephosphorylating targets of Cdk1, a well-studied cyclin-dependent protein kinase. Cdc14 antagonizes Cdk1 by stimulating proteolysis of its cyclin partner (cyclin B), through the dephosphorylation of Cdh1, a regulator of the anaphase-promoting complex. Cdc14 also dephosphorylates Swi5 to enhance transcription of Sic1, an inhibitor of Cdk1. This \\"simple\\" mitotic exit model became complicated as additional roles in mitosis were attributed to ScCdc14. These included stabilizing the spindle and regulating cytokinesis and rDNA/ telomere segregation. Consistent with such multiple roles, ScCdc14 has been found to bind several proteins that regulate the cell cycle and DNA replication, or that associate with the spindle or kinetochore. Work in other yeasts further complicated the understanding of the role of Cdc14. Mutants in the ortholog of the fission Schizosaccharomyces pombe exit mitosis normally (unlike S. cerevisiae) but are altered in septation and cytokinesis. Also, while the protein regulates the Cdk1 ortholog of S. pombe, this occurs through a process unlike that of S. cerevisiae; it does not dephosphorylate the Sic1 or Cdh1 orthologs, but promotes the inactivation of Cdc2 by down-regulating Cdc25 phosphatase. Cdc14 of Candida albicans is also involved in septation and cytokinesis, but not mitotic exit. Studies of Cdc14 in animal systems has further muddled the Cdc14 story. Animals have up to three diverged Cdc14 genes, with multiple splice variants, that appear to diverge in function and location. Also, several crucial studies have yielded contradictory results. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans makes one Cdc14 (CeCdc14), which localizes to the spindle and centrosomes in mitosis, and to the cytoplasm at interphase. One RNAi study with CeCdc14 caused cytokinesis defects, which was consistent with similar work in Xenopus laevis. However, a second RNAi study showed no defects, and it was suggested that the first experiment used too many oligonucleotides which caused off-target effects. Contradictory data also exist with human Cdc14. Unlike CeCdc14, hCdc14A is not centrosomic in mitosis, but is cytoplasmic and centrosomic during interphase. HCdc14B was shown in one study to be primarily nucleolar like ScCdc14 (but unlike CeCdc14), but others detected hCdc14B on nuclear filaments and the spindle While RNAi depletion of hCdc14A and hCdc14B led to defects in centriole duplication, cell cycle progression, and mitotic exit, cells deleted for the genes showed no defects in growth or mitosis, and a similar failure of a cell cycle defect was also shown in cultured human cells using conditional hCdc14A and hCdc14B knockouts.Berdougo, E. 2009. Human Cdc14 phosphatases are not essential for viability and do not regulate mitotic exit. Ph.D. thesis, Weill Medical College of Cornell University. Finally, in chicken, knockout lines totally lacked defects in cell-cycle progression, mitotic entry or exit, cytokinesis, or centrosome behavior. There is evidence that Cdc14 may participate in a DNA damage checkpoint. A novel role for Cdc14 in eukaryotes was suggested by studies of Phytophthora infestans, a eukaryotic microbe known best as the cause of the Irish Potato Famine. Notably, while the species mentioned above are all relatively close taxonomic relatives (in the Fungi/Metazoa group), P. infestans has a distinct evolutionary history; it is classified as an oomycete, and is a member of the Kingdom Stramenopila (the Heterokonts in some schemes) along with diatoms and brown algae. The single Cdc14 gene of P. infestans (PiCdc14) is expressed distinctly from those of fungi and metazoans; instead of being transcribed throughout the cell cycle and regulated post- translationally, PiCdc14 is under strong transcriptional control and is not expressed in hyphae, where most mitosis takes place. Instead, PiCdc14 is made during the formation of asexual spores, including its biflagellated zoospores. PiCdc14 was found to accumulate near the basal bodies, at the base of the flagella. In light of the varying roles of Cdc14 in fungi and animals, it was suggested that the P. infestans data implied that an ancestral role of Cdc14 involved the flagella stage of eukaryotes. Additional data in support of this theory was later obtained from studies in zebrafish, where its Cdc14 proteins were also found to localize to the basal body and play roles in the formation of cilia, which are short forms of flagella. Cdc14 is also involved in regulation of key steps during meiosis in budding yeast. Cdc55, a regulatory subunit of Protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A), sequesters Cdc14 in the nucleolus during early stage of meiosis. The sequestration of Cdc14 is necessary for assembling the meiosis I spindle. Although, the early stage sequestration of Cdc14 is not essential for separation of chromosomes. FEAR (Cdc Fourteen Early Anaphase Release) complex proteins, SLK19 and SPO12 regulate the release of Cdc14. The release of Cdc14 from nucleolus results in cdk1 inactivation and ultimately in disassembly of spindle during Anaphase of meiosis I. Cells deprived of Cdc14 or SLK19 and SPO12 have abnormal meiosis. They have only one division during meiosis. The chromosomes also segregate abnormally. The abnormality arises due to delay in dissembling of spindle during Anaphase I. However, the segregation of chromosomes continue and both the phases of meiotic segregations take place on prolonged meiosis I spindle. Cdc14 along with SPO12 and SLK19 play a critical role in ensuring that the two phases of chromosomal segregation take place consecutively during meiosis.  Distribution of Cdc14 through evolution  Cdc14 is widely distributed, being found in most eukaryote kingdoms. However, it is not found in all species based on searches of sequenced genomes. One or more Cdc14 genes are found in alveolates, animals, fungi, trypanosomes, and lower plants. However, Cdc14 genes have apparently been lost in some lineages, including higher plants, rhodophytes, and slime molds. There is a fairly tight positive correlation between the presence of Cdc14 in a species and whether that species makes flagella or cilia. This may be related to the ancestral role of Cdc14. Whether flagella-anchoring basal bodies or centrioles involved in mitosis appeared first during evolution has been debated, but one theory is that flagella evolved first as a motility and sensory organelle, and the basal body was later co-opted into a mitotic role. The function of Cdc14 may have adapted to different functions during the evolution of those organelles.  Targets  Most information about the biochemical function of Cdc14 comes from studies of S. cerevisiae. In that species, one important target is Cdh1/Hct1. Cdh1 associates with the APC and leads to APC activity (anaphase promoting complex); activated APC is a key driver in mitotic exit. Furthermore, Cdc14 dephosphorylates the stoichiometric inhibitor of the mitotic cyclins, Sic1, stabilizing Sic1 protein. Cdc14 activity also leads to the stabilization of the transcription factor Swi5, leading to an upregulation of Sic1 transcription. It is possible that Cdc14 acts as a phosphatase on all Clb-Cdk1 targets, acting to reverse the effects of the mitotic cyclins. The targets of Cdc14 are apparently quite diverse. Yeast two-hybrid and affinity capture methods have identified many proteins that potentially interact with ScCdc14, including those known to regulate the cell cycle and DNA replication, or that associate with the spindle or kinetochore. Cdc14 also appears to inhibit RNA polymerase I, which helps allow complete chromosome disjunction by eliminating ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcripts that otherwise would block condensin binding to rDNA.  Regulation  In S. cerevisiae, Cdc14 is regulated by its competitive inhibitor Cfi/Net1, which localizes Cdc14 to the nucleolus. During anaphase, Cdc14 is \\"uncaged\\" and spreads to the rest of the cell. Two networks mediate the release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus: FEAR (CDC Fourteen Early Anaphase Release) and MEN (Mitotic Exit Network); while these networks are complex, it is thought that these networks result in the phosphorylation of Cfi/Net1 and/or Cdc14, resulting in disassociation of the complex. In S. pombe, phosphorylation of the Cdc14 ortholog by Cdk1 is known to directly inhibit the catalytic activity of the phosphatase.

History According to historian Kevin Wright, the extant iron swing bridge at New Bridge Landing occupies the site of a series of wooden drawbridges that have spanned the narrows of the Hackensack River at New Bridge since 1745. Until 1790, this was the first river crossing above Newark Bay and so carried overland traffic between Manhattan and the interior of North America. The bridge became vitally important during the American Revolution and was crossed by General George Washington at the head of the retreating garrison of Fort Lee on November 20, 1776, earning its appellation as the Bridge That Saved A Nation. Hills on either side of New Bridge were fortified during the war to defend this strategic crossing and stone houses flanking the bridge served as forts, battleground, encampment ground and military headquarters in every year of the conflict. New Bridge was literally, \\"the crossroads of the American Revolution,\\" having supposedly survived more of the war than any other spot in America. Bergen County installed the extant iron swing bridge in 1889 as part of the ongoing replacement of outdated wooden drawbridges, which slowed the passage of ship traffic on the river. A drawbridge only opened one lane of traffic, while a swing bridge opened two, allowing boats to pass simultaneously in both directions. The Bergen County Board of Chosen Freeholders instructed a Bridge Committee to proceed with plans, specifications and cost estimates for a new structure to span the Hackensack River at the village of New Bridge at a special meeting in April 1888. Freeholder Zabriskie, heading the committee, put the cost of the proposed structure at about $9,000. On June 25, 1888, the Bridge Committee revised specifications for the new bridge and decided to re-advertise for bids. On the final day of June, they adopted their plans and specifications. In July 1888, contracts for erecting an iron bridge at New Bridge were awarded on the following bids: Bridge Contracts: New Bridge Draw — Smith Bridge Co., $4,170; Penn. $4,390; Berlin, $4,287; Dean & Westbrook, $4,330; Variety, $4,390; Columbia, $4,345; Pittsburg, $4,467; King Iron, $3,990 — King Iron awarded contract. Bids for stone work — Joseph Stagg, $3,994; S. H. Vanderbeck, $4,324. Contract to Mr. Stagg. Joseph W. Stagg, House Mover and Bridge Builder, resided in the Highland section of Englewood. In the final week of August 1888, Joseph Stagg commenced tearing down the bridge at New Bridge and began laying stone for the abutments. By the close of November 1888, the people of New Bridge were indignant. The old bridge had been torn down about August first and although contractor Joseph Stagg had completed his portion of the contract, no attempt had been made on the part of the new contractors to do their work and open the highway. A fire at their Cleveland foundry reportedly delayed the King Iron Bridge Company from completing its manufacture of bridge parts (perhaps explaining why the trusses bear the imprint of \\"Phoenix Iron\\"). The new iron swing bridge at New Bridge was finally opened on Monday, February 4, 1889. At their monthly meeting on that same date, the Board of Chosen Freeholders were presented a bill for $100 in favor of Joseph Stagg for building a temporary foot-bridge across the Hackensack River at Cherry Hill, which apparently served the citizens of New Bridge during the six months that they waited for the iron bridge to be installed. On March 2, 1889, Nicholas B. Demarest completed the work of filling in the approaches to the new span across the river at New Bridge. In June 1891, the Freeholders authorized payment of the following bridge-keepers: at Old Bridge, Bloomer Brothers, $20; at New Bridge, Abraham Leggett, $60. On August 15, 1892, according to newspaper reports, \\"a quartet of Hackensack youth with more or less “tanglefoot” [cheap whiskey] on board, did considerable mischief at Cherry Hill and New Bridge,\\" placing the key to the drawbridge in position, thus endangering travel over the draw. A wooden sidewalk was built on the north side of the bridge in 1900. On November 14, 1906, the caboose on the freight train, due at the Cherry Hill Station about 6:30 p.m., derailed while being switched from the northbound to the southbound tracks, thereby delaying traffic for about two hours. On the same night, the New Bridge got stuck in open position after passage of a boat, further delaying the people who had already been delayed by the caboose accident. The bridge remained operational, principally for coal and lumber barges, until 1940 when replacement of the downstream bridge at Anderson Street, Hackensack, with a fixed span, closed the river upstream to navigation. A new roadway for extending Hackensack Avenue beyond its intersection with Main Street in River Edge, to an extension of New Bridge Road in New Milford was laid out in 1956 across the northwest corner of the Bergen County Historical Society's property, to a new concrete-and-steel bridge over the Hackensack River, 500' north of the iron truss bridge. Thus, the Bergen County Historical Society prevented construction of an elevated highway bridge immediately adjacent to the south gable-end of the historic Steuben House. The closing of the 1889 swing bridge to automotive traffic turned Main Street, River Edge, into a dead-end in front of the Steuben House. Old New Bridge Road (on the boundary between New Milford and Teaneck) likewise became a dead end. The Army Corps of Engineers planned to destroy the old bridge as soon as the new one was completed. The Bergen County Historical Society and the Dumont Women's Club successfully petitioned to keep the historic span for a pedestrian crossing. Colonel John T. O’Neill, of the Army Corps of Engineers, yielded to Freeholder Walter M. Neill, who promised that Bergen County would henceforth maintain the old bridge, if it were spared. Historians Claire Tholl and Kevin Wright provided the research for its listing on the New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places as the \\"Draw Bridge at New Bridge\\" in 1989 to commemorate its centennial. It is recognized as the oldest surviving highway swing-bridge in the State of New Jersey. It can no longer rotate because it has been welded to the piers at either end.

It was the first successful new 35mm rangefinder camera with Leica specifications to emerge on the market after World War II that uses the 39mm screw lens-mount. The Minolta-35 range of cameras was manufactured in quantities during its twelve-year production period, totalling about 40,000 units. Only the 1933 FED and the 1940 Leotax cameras had appeared successfully before it, although several Leica copies had appeared in both Italy and Japan. Models There are eight successive models of the Minolta-35. 1 - Minolta-35 (Model A) On entering the miniature camera business, Chiyoda Kogaku had decided to make the frame size 24×32mm, a logical proposition at the time since most photo copies were made on paper closer to this format. The already established international standard was 36 images of 24×36mm. By doing so, a standard length of film yielded four more exposures on a 36-exposure load. The Minolta-35 has a combined viewfinder and rangefinder eyepiece, negating the need to move the sight from one window to the other. It also features a self- timer and a hinged rear door to facilitate film loading. The camera came with a decent Super Rokkor 45mm f/2.8 standard optic comprising five elements in three groups, including the front group of three cemented elements designed to secure sharp images on the small negative. When the camera appeared all engravings on the lens and on the slow-speed dial were oriented to be read from the front side of the camera. Later, at about serial no. 4000, they were turned to be read as one holds the camera for picture taking. Accessory mounted in the shoe on top of the camera is secured by a spring-loaded ball that sometimes mistakenly is assumed to be a flash synchroniser contact, which it is not. 2 - Minolta-35 (Model B) Already after a few months production successive modifications were introduced, both internally and on the outside. The first one, at about serial no.600, the engraving sequence on the long time dial was changed from 1-2-5-10-25 to 1-2-4-8-25. At about serial number 1500 the inscription at the top of the camera was simplified from the full company name, Chiyoda-Kogaku Osaka, to the initials C.K.S. for Chiyoda Kogaku Seiko. Some cameras featured a blue © as part of the lens designation like in \\"© Rokkor\\". It was used to indicate a coated optics rather than a copyright. 3 – Minolta-35 (Model C) At about serial number 4000 the frame size was increased to 33mm length. It would gradually increase until finally, in 1953, it reach the full 36mm length when it was realised that it was impossible to obtain acceptance for the shorter format for export, since automatic cutting and mounting machines for colour slides would destroy three out of four slides. In addition, the rewind release lever was increased somewhat in size. The engravings on the lens and on the slow speed dial were turned to be read as one holds the camera for picture taking! 4 – Minolta-35 (Model D) In 1949 at about serial no.10,000, a recess was introduced under the lens-mount to improve operating the lens focusing lever, and the rewind release lever was moved, placed under the frame counter. By now the film frame length has been increased to 34mm, and carrying strap eyelets has been added at either end of the camera body. 5 – Minolta-35 Model E From late 1951 at about serial number 15,000, the camera model designation was engraved on the camera front in the upper right corner of the lens mount plate, starting at model E. At this stage, a mechanical flash synchronization receptacle was provided at the back just below the accessory shoe. The viewfinder now has an eyesight adjustment, accomplished by rotating the eyepiece bezel. 6 – Minolta-35 Model F A year later at about serial number 17,000, the flash synchronization became available using a standard coaxial PC socket. 7 – Minolta-35 Model II Introduced in 1953, and the frame format remains at 24 x 34mm. During the production run several changes were made, allowing for a second version possibly introduced about serial number 70,000: The most notable feature is the deeper drawn top and base cover plates. In addition, the full company name is reintroduced: CHIYODA KOGAKU. A red X between 8 and 25 at the slow speed dial indicates the proper flash synchronising shutter speed. After two years run in the summer of 1955, two new 50mm standard lenses in modernised barrels became available; the Super Rokkor 1:2 50mm and the 1:2.8 50mm. 8 – Minolta-35 Model IIB Finally, the last model was introduced in May 1958 at about serial number 103,000, now engraved under the company name at the top. The notable new features are the lever wind with the frame counter in its hub, and the rewind release lever moved away from it and it is much smaller. This is the only Minolta-35 which used the standard 24 x 36mm format. The standard lens on this model is the black finished Super Rokkor 1:1.8 50mm. Production ended a year later in preference of the new area of 35mm SLR cameras well on their way with the Minolta SR-2 and its successors.

About Founded with the influence of the distinguished Bach scholar Charles Sanford Terry (historian) and direction of Warren T Clemens in 1913 as the Aberdeen Bach Society, it was reconstituted as Aberdeen Bach Choir in 1956. With an initial 12 members it has grown to now having between 90 and 100. Aberdeen Bach Choir (Scottish Registered Charity SC008609), based in the city of Aberdeen, Scotland performs the music not only of Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750), but also a wide variety of choral music from the 17th to the 21st Century. The choir currently performs two main recitals a year in St Machar's Cathedral in Old Aberdeen. It has also performed in recent years at Brechin Arts Festival, Greyfriars Kirk in Edinburgh and in London. Aberdeen Bach Choir is affiliated to Making Music Scotland.

The Chronicle of St Machar In January 1998, an application for funding from the National Lottery to commission a new work was accepted. The Chronicle of Saint Machar, a piece for orchestra and two choirs, which was based on the life of St. Machar, was composed by the renowned Scottish composer, John McLeod (composer). The piece is an evocative work which combines adult and children choirs, along with orchestra and a range of percussion which includes bells and a Saab car spring. The first performance took place in the cathedral bearing the saint's name, St Machar's Cathedral, Aberdeen on 25 April 1999, (reviewed by James Allan; The Scotsman; 26 April 1999), followed by a second performance at the same venue on 6 June 1999. With further 'Awards for All' funding from the Scottish Arts Council lottery fund, a third performance took place on 28 October 2000 at Greyfriars Kirk, Edinburgh (reviewed by Conrad Wilson; The Herald (Glasgow); 10/2000).

Early life Lucien Dubuc's father was Joseph Dubuc who was a prominent Canadian federal and provincial politician as well a pioneer lawyer. Political career Dubuc ran for a seat to the Alberta Legislature in the Peace River provincial electoral district as an Independent in the 1905 Alberta general election. He defeated Liberal candidate James Cornwall by an unknown number of votes. The election however was overturned by the provincial cabinet due to significant irregularities and even going so far as to question whether the vote was held at all. Dubuc took the matter to court to force the Executive council to recognize the results and prevent the calling of a new election. His legal action failed when the judge ruled that they had no jurisdiction in the matter. Judicial career Dubuc moved to a house he had built in Edmonton in 1912 where he resided until 1956. He set up a legal practice in Edmonton when he arrived in 1912. He was appointed to the district court bench in 1920 and in 1924 Chief Justice of Northern Alberta. His obituary was printed in The Edmonton Journal on March 6, 1956.
