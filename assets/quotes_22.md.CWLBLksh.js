He was most active when his country was known as Dahomey. Of Fon origins, he entered the national political stage in 1963, when he quelled riots started by supporters of former president Hubert Maga. Henceforth he served under various government positions, including briefly the de facto head of Dahomey. He was dismissed from the army twice, mainly due to his residence in the south. Hachème was brought back shortly thereafter on both occasions, being assigned small or largely non-functioning positions. Along with Alphonse Alley and Pascal Chabi Kao, Hachème was accused of planning a coup against President Mathieu Kérékou on February 28, 1973 and was imprisoned with 20 years of hard labor. He was released in 1984. Military career Hachème was of Fon origins and was born in Porto Novo. After entering the military, he attained the rank of major. He entered the national political stage in 1963, when he quelled riots trying to bring former president Hubert Maga back into power at his hometown, Parakou. Academic Samuel Decalo described Hachème's crushing of the demonstrations as \\"brutal\\".. His rise to power occurred during a period of intense regionalism in Dahomey. They were spurred by the historical resentment shared by members of the former kingdoms of Abomey, Porto Novo, and disorganised tribes from the north.. Its result was the creation of three de facto tribal zones: the north, southeast, and southwest.. This regionalism permeated into the armed forces, compounded by divisions of officers into cliques based on education. Hachème was a member of what Decalo called the Abomey clique, which also included prominent officers Philippe Aho, Benoit Sinzogan, and Benoit Adandejan.. He was briefly head of the Comite Militare de Vigilance in 1967, which was set up to administer President Christophe Soglo's regime. When Maurice Kouandete seized the presidency later that year, Hachème was appointed chairman of his interim government, the Comite Militaire Revolutionaire, and served as de facto head of state from December 18, 1967 to December 19, 1967. Emile Derlin Zinsou was appointed president in August 1968, and with the act the Comite lost its value and was dismissed.. Hachème, however, did not witness the dissolution of the Comite. Alleged to have plotted against Kouandete and Alphonse Alley, Hachème was expelled from the armed forces in January when many southern soldiers were removed, though was brought back shortly afterwards. In mid-1970, Hachème was chosen to be the chief of staff of the Service Civique, a command whose officers did not see service. The Civique was, rather, more agricultural in nature, and served several other roles.. Captain Pierre Kadjo Koffi was named his assistant.. Later life In October 1972, when Mathieu Kérékou led a coup and seized power, Hachème was again dismissed from the army as well as every other senior officer from the south. He was instead given the post of Commissioner of Dahomey's Ceramic Crafts (SONAC), a role with very little responsibility. Along with Alley and Pascal Chabi Kao, Hachème was accused of planning a coup against Kérékou on February 28, 1973 and was imprisoned with 20 years of hard labor.. Hachème was released on amnesty on August 1, 1984, as well as all other political detainees besides those involved in the \\"ignoble and barbarous imperialist armed aggression of Sunday, January 16, 1977.\\".

It is surrounded by three hills named Harihareshwar, Harshinachal and Pushpadri. The river Savitri enters the Arabian Sea from the town of Harihareshwar. Towards the north of the town is the temple of Lord Harihareshwar, said to have been blessed by Lord Shiva. Hence Harihareshwar is often referred to as Dev-ghar or \\"house of God\\". Besides a major pilgrimage center, Harihareshwar is a popular beach resort with two beaches, one to the north and the other to the south of the temple. Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation has a resort on the south beach. Harihareshwar, along with Shrivardhan and Diveagar Beach forms a popular weekend beach destination from Pune (190 km) and Mumbai (210 km). The Kalbhairav Jayanti Utsav (Festival on Birthday of Deity Kalbhairav) was initiated by Mr. Yashawant Balawant Nagle who was Sardar of Queen of Janjira Administering Harihareshwar village. He donated quite a large part of his property for funding the Temple management. Harihareshwar Temple Harihareshwar south beach Harihareshwar Temple complex has two adjacent temples. The smaller Kalbhairav temple is expected to be visited first, before entering the main Harihareshwar temple housing an ancient Shiva Linga.

In 2011 its population was 480.  Etymology  Finningham's name is a union of three words: Finn; ing; and ham. Finningham is a hamlet or encampment (ham) of the people (ing) of Finn or Finna. The surname Finn is German, derived from an ethnic name referring to people from Finland. The area was populated by the Angles - one of the main Germanic people who settled after the Romans.  History  241x241pxIn the 1870s, Finningham was described as > \\"a village and a parish in Hartismere district, Suffolk. The village stands > adjacent to the Eastern Union railway, 6¼ miles SW of Eye; and has a station > on the railway, a post office under Stowmarket, and a fair on 4 Sept.\\" Finningham railway station opened in 1848 for goods traffic and in 1849 for passengers. Located in the neighbouring parish of Bacton, Suffolk on the Great Eastern Main Line, the station provided a train link to London and Norwich. The station was closed in 1966 as part of the Beeching Axe, although the line remains open and runs over the nearby Wickham Road. The monk and author Robert de Finingham, who died in 1460, was born and educated in Finningham.  Church of St. Bartholomew  Built in 1560, the Church of St. Bartholomew has north and south porches, a chancel, and a west tower. The west tower is the most prominent feature of the Church, as it is the tallest and the oldest, with no buttresses to support it. 'The opening above the nave roof to the east consists of a quatrefoil in a circle and this seems likely to be original since there are no traces of any earlier openings here'. In 1999, a memorial was installed in the church to commemorate the powers of observation and recording shown in historian John Frere’s publication of Stone Age artefacts found near Hoxne in the late 1700s. Frere’s excavations and discoveries has resulted in this area of Mid Suffolk being considered one of the most important middle Pleistocene sites in Europe. John Marius Wilson described the church as \\"ancient but good; and has a fine font, and monuments of the Freres and the Fenns. There are a Wesleyan chapel, and charities £26.\\"  Geography  Finningham sits in a slight valley either side of a tributary of the River Dove that flows north-eastwards via Eye to join the River Waveney at the Norfolk border. The village is situated on the 'High Suffolk' claylands, deposited on the Ice Ages over the chalk that underlies most of the county. This makes the area good for arable farming, because the clay binds the soil together and makes it less prone to erosion.  Demographics  Population = left According to the 2011 Census there were 239 males and 241 females living in the parish. Over the years, Finningham's population has changed, reaching its peak in 1851 with 571. Population fell between 1911 and 1921, possibly due to World War I. In 1931, there were 175 males and 152 females in Finningham, but 20 years later, the population of females grew by 17 whereas the population of males fell by 17, most likely due to World War Two and its aftermath. 302x302px = Age Structure = The mean age in Finningham was 44.9 years (2011 Census) – compared to the national average of 39.3 years. This could be because of the higher proportion of elderly people (22.8% were over 65 years old) who may have retired and live in rural villages such as Finningham. = Occupational Structure = 297x297pxAgriculture was a major industry in Suffolk, partly due to the geography of the area. In 1881, 83 people were employed by the agricultural industry \\\\- more than any other in Finningham. 81 of them were men, as women at the time spent more time doing domestic work due to social attitudes and status at the time.leftThe occupational structure of Finningham has diversified. in 1881, 73% of men worked in the agricultural industry so there was a reliance, but in 2011 there appears to be a range of secondary and tertiary industries. This is reflective of the UK's economic change throughout the 1800s, 1900s and the present day. In 1881, there were a majority of women working in 'Personal Service', 'Clothing', and 'Textiles', yet in 2011 more women work in the tertiary sector. The changed social attitudes is reflected by the occupational structure in 2011. Whilst men dominate ‘skilled trades’ (labour jobs that require specific training such as a carpenter or electrician), more women work in ‘professional occupations’ than men. The fact that more women in Finningham work in the tertiary sector highlights the difference in the role of women in society between 1881 and 2011. 77 women had an ‘unknown occupation’ in 1881, whereas only 0.6% are unemployed or have never worked in 2011. 'In the 1970s and continuing into the 1980s and 1990s, it became increasingly difficult to find women to hoe, weed, pick stones, and the like, work which on the whole was neither skilled nor unduly heavy'. This, combined with increasing mechanisation and changing patterns of land use meant that the demand for such jobs declined, so women had to find work in the manufacturing and tertiary sectors. = Religion = Christianity is the most followed religion in Finningham, shown by the presence of the Church of St. Bartholomew. Church attendance has fallen during Christmas and Easter from 2006 to 2012. This could be reflected from the 2001 census, when 81% followed Christianity and 10% had 'no religion', compared to the 19% in 2011.  Transport  The closure of Finningham railway station in 1966 meant that the nearest railway station is located 7.5 miles south in Stowmarket on the Great Eastern Main Line, providing links to Ipswich and London. The A140 - the main road link between Ipswich and Norfolk - is located 3.6 miles from Finningham, and can be accessed via Wickham Road, or by the A143 to the north.

The name 'Flowton' originally derives from the word 'Flocctun', meaning a flock of sheep or a sheep farm. The parish is located around six miles north west of Ipswich, which is the county town of Suffolk. Flowton contains the hamlet of Flowton Brook, and consists of rural farmland accompanied by scattered farm houses and a few newer builds situated nearby the parish church of 'St Mary's'. In the 1870s, Flowton was described as: :\\"Flowton, a parish in Bosmere district, Suffolk; 3½ miles WNW of Bramford r. station, and 5½ NW by W of Ipswich. Post town, Bramford under Ipswich. Acres 495. Real property, £994. Pop., 151. Houses, 34. The property is divided among a few. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Norwich. Value, £140.* Patron, Henry Thornton, Esq. The church is good.\\"  St Mary's Church  Flowton's parish church, 'St Mary's' was built in the 13th century and has been a Christian place of worship for around 700 years. The church holds many fundraising events, gaining goodwill and financial support from the village, as well as from the wider population. St Mary's Church is a Grade I listed building, made of flint rubble walling with freestone dressings and buttressing. It consists of a nave, chance, south porch and west tower. Evidence from medieval mass can be seen east of the porch on buttresses where there are mass dials carved into the stone. These dials would have previously shown the villages the time at which the service would be held. Changes to the church have been made over the centuries with its most recent known addition being around the late 18th century when a vestry was added to the north of the chancel. It is thought that this vestry was used as a school room for the village children. Historical Map from the 20th Century Showing the Civil Parish of Flowton Rev. John Charlesworth (1782-1864), an evangelical Christian and abolitionist, was rector of Flowton, 1815-44.  Manorial history  Flowton Priory = Flowton Priory was in the village of Flowton for 400 years, after being built in 1525. In 1928 it was moved brick by brick to Harpenden, Hertfordshire, after its owner, a wealthy family member, ordered it to be deconstructed and reassembled. In 1994, it was bought by racing driver, David Pinkney. \\"The great thing is that when it was moved, every beam, brick and tile was checked and made good. And it was put on solid foundations with a damp-proof course.\\" It is currently listed as being a Grade II Tudor Mansion.  Population Structure  Total Population of Flowton Civil Parish, Suffolk, as reported by the Census of Population from 1801 to 2011 There is an irregular change in both Flowton's total population and the number of houses between 1831 and 1861. The population graph shows that there is an increase in the number of houses between 1831 and 1851, with a decrease in population. This is then followed by a further decline in population, along with a decrease in the number of houses in 1921. Flowton's population grows rapidly 1811 and 1831, it then remains fairly steady until 1851. Therefore, indicating that Flowton's community was developing, as there was also an increase in the number of houses. Both population and the number of houses declined in the early 1900s, with the population not considerably rising again until 2001.  Employment  Occupational history = The occupations of male and female residents in Flowton in 1881, according to the 1881 Census Report Flowton's employment throughout history has mainly been centred on the primary industry.Between 1500 and 1700 the main type of employment listed for Flowton was yeomen and husbandmen, meaning Flowton's land was cultivated by tenant farmers. By the early 1800s, 37 people were listed to work in agriculture and 3 in retail trade. However, by the mid-1800s there was detailed to be a bricklayer, corn miller and 7 farmers. The occupational graph shows that in 1881, the main source of Flowton's employment was in the agricultural industry. Women at the time were listed to have no specified occupation or an unknown occupation, suggesting they were involved in domestic duties or a form of assistance in a relatives business. The graph shows females were employed in a wider range of industries compared to males at the time, with only one male not being employed in agriculture. = Recent Occupational Structure = Flowton's traditional industry of agriculture still employs a small number of its population. However, census data collected in 2011 shows how the population of Flowton has diversified in terms of employment. Around a third of the population were employed in the manual labour industry in 2011, which now includes construction and mechanical work. Men are now employed within a total of nine census industry categories, whereas the graphs shows in 1881 they were only shown to be employed in two. A majority of Flowton's population in 2011 were employed in public sector work, such as health and social work, education, admin and financial. The most recent census data shows how female employment has changed since 1881. Women in 2011 were shown to be employed in a variety of industries, some of which would have traditional been seen as male orientated in 1881, such as in agriculture and construction.  Flowton Community  Flowton's villagers often hold fundraising events, with its church often being at the centre of this. The village annually holds an open garden event, where visitors can walk around participating villagers gardens. Alongside this a flower festival takes place within the Church, both lasting two days. Flowton charges a small joint fee is for a ticket to both events. The church is also part of Suffolk historic churches trust annual cycle ride, where money is raised for its upkeep and maintenance.

Bardera has an estimated population of 106,000 and the main Bardera District Hospital is out of service. The main Bardera hospital was last used during the early 1990s when UN and US forces were stationed here for the humanitarian mission which lasted from 1993 to 1996. Previously, all health care centers were concentrated on the east side of town. There is sizable population on the west side of Bardera. Residents of the nearby town of Sarinley and the village of Muuri will also utilize the new West Bardera Maternity Unit. History Residents of Bardera are able to go to one of the medical centers which offer maternity services. West Bardera Maternity Unit (WBMU) is an offshoot of East Bardera Mothers' and Children's Hospital (EBMCH) which started in early 2006. This new center was opened in December 2008. Bardera has always maintained half dozen functioning MCH and OPD centers but their capacity to serve the community was limited. East Bardera Mothers and Children's Hospital was the first center to combine the skills of two nurses and a midwife and her assistant, along with a junior pharmacist, all females. Services Staff at WBMU give women basic health services, often for free. The two centers, WBMU and EBMCH have one of the best-organized basic women's and children's health services in Somalia. West Bardera Maternity Unit Staff The figures for 2007 show that over 6,000 people utilized health services at EBMCH. Other services available at WBMU include children's vaccines and the dispensing of over-the-counter medicines. Staff West Bardera Maternity Unit has two experienced and well-trained midwives and their assistants, along with two nurses and a junior pharmacist, all females. For the absence of government health services, thousands of people from the general public have been coming to East Bardera MCH for medical attention. Four people work at the new West Bardera Maternity Unit, and eight people work at the East Bardera Mothers and Children's Hospital. The two centers share supplies, pharmacy and training. Four days' training conducted by Fardowsa Abdinur Hashi Support As part of East Bardera Mothers and Children's Hospital, West Bardera Maternity Unit is using a donated or rent free space. WMTU center needs maintenance and some more beds for the expected demand for extra beds, toilets and other resting spaces for women. Staff get training seminars from nearby Bardera Polytechnic College. The college provides this training at no cost to the hospital system. Funding and supply limitations As space and funding are causing some limitations, both centers share one pharmacy which is part of the East Bardera Mothers and Children's Hospital. Children, girls, women and expecting mothers get medical advice and basic medicines from the nurses and pharmacist at EBMCH, where the west maternity unit is currently only offering prenatal to maternity services. Supplements and medical records are available at both locations.

After selling his guitar and abandoning \\"lead singer\\" ambitions in Athens, Georgia, in 1993, Walker started to assemble a studio. Starting with a synthesizer, a drum machine, and a guitar amplifier, he would work the filter knobs until the paint rubbed off, while dreaming of standing on stage in front of adoring fans and flashing lights. From such humble beginnings, Stewart stepped up his knowledge of synthesis, drum programming and mixing. His early techno enthusiasm expressed itself in a line of recordings which began with Detroit-based labels in 1997, leading eventually to larger projects with well-known European techno labels such as Minus, Tresor, and Mille Plateaux. In 2001, he founded his first imprint Persona Records which released almost 50 EPs and albums by himself and other talents such as Touane, Reynold, and Andrea Sartori. Ten years later in 2011, Stewart founded Son of Cataclysm as an artistic reaction to the economic and human rights crises of our time. Walker played at the re-opening of Berlin's Tresor club in 2007. His music occurs around 128 to 132 bpm, and is dense with many harmonic and percussive layers. Walker's Concentricity was cited as \\"one of the standout long players of the year\\" on Resident Advisor in 2007. Successes with Persona and other independent labels have brought Stewart's shows to worldwide audiences for 15 years. Stewart has been a fixture on the global club circuit. Always playing live original music, has endeared Stewart to fans who are looking for soul and wisdom in their entertainment.

Cornerstones in this field are computational learning theory, granular computing, bioinformatics, and, long ago, structural probability . The main focus is on the algorithms which compute statistics rooting the study of a random phenomenon, along with the amount of data they must feed on to produce reliable results. This shifts the interest of mathematicians from the study of the distribution laws to the functional properties of the statistics, and the interest of computer scientists from the algorithms for processing data to the information they process.  The Fisher parametric inference problem  Concerning the identification of the parameters of a distribution law, the mature reader may recall lengthy disputes in the mid 20th century about the interpretation of their variability in terms of fiducial distribution , structural probabilities , priors/posteriors , and so on. From an epistemology viewpoint, this entailed a companion dispute as to the nature of probability: is it a physical feature of phenomena to be described through random variables or a way of synthesizing data about a phenomenon? Opting for the latter, Fisher defines a fiducial distribution law of parameters of a given random variable that he deduces from a sample of its specifications. With this law he computes, for instance “the probability that μ (mean of a Gaussian variable – our note) is less than any assigned value, or the probability that it lies between any assigned values, or, in short, its probability distribution, in the light of the sample observed”.  The classic solution  Fisher fought hard to defend the difference and superiority of his notion of parameter distribution in comparison to analogous notions, such as Bayes' posterior distribution, Fraser's constructive probability and Neyman's confidence intervals. For half a century, Neyman's confidence intervals won out for all practical purposes, crediting the phenomenological nature of probability. With this perspective, when you deal with a Gaussian variable, its mean μ is fixed by the physical features of the phenomenon you are observing, where the observations are random operators, hence the observed values are specifications of a random sample. Because of their randomness, you may compute from the sample specific intervals containing the fixed μ with a given probability that you denote confidence. = Example = Let X be a Gaussian variableBy default, capital letters (such as U, X) will denote random variables and small letters (u, x) their corresponding specifications. with parameters \\\\mu and \\\\sigma^2 and \\\\\\\\{X_1,\\\\ldots,X_m\\\\\\\\} a sample drawn from it. Working with statistics : S_\\\\mu =\\\\sum_{i=1}^m X_i and : S_{\\\\sigma^2}=\\\\sum_{i=1}^m (X_i-\\\\overline X)^2,\\\\text{ where }\\\\overline X = \\\\frac{S_{\\\\mu}}{m} is the sample mean, we recognize that : T=\\\\frac{S_{\\\\mu}-m\\\\mu}{\\\\sqrt{S_{\\\\sigma^2}}}\\\\sqrt\\\\frac{m-1}{m}=\\\\frac{\\\\overline X-\\\\mu}{\\\\sqrt{S_{\\\\sigma^2}/(m(m-1))}} follows a Student's t distribution with parameter (degrees of freedom) m − 1, so that : f_T(t)=\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(m/2)}{\\\\Gamma((m-1)/2)}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi(m-1)}}\\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{t^2}{m-1}\\\\right)^{m/2}. Gauging T between two quantiles and inverting its expression as a function of \\\\mu you obtain confidence intervals for \\\\mu. With the sample specification: :\\\\mathbf x=\\\\\\\\{7.14, 6.3, 3.9, 6.46, 0.2, 2.94, 4.14, 4.69, 6.02, 1.58\\\\\\\\} having size m = 10, you compute the statistics s_\\\\mu = 43.37 and s_{\\\\sigma^2}=46.07, and obtain a 0.90 confidence interval for \\\\mu with extremes (3.03, 5.65).  Inferring functions with the help of a computer  From a modeling perspective the entire dispute looks like a chicken-egg dilemma: either fixed data by first and probability distribution of their properties as a consequence, or fixed properties by first and probability distribution of the observed data as a corollary. The classic solution has one benefit and one drawback. The former was appreciated particularly back when people still did computations with sheet and pencil. Per se, the task of computing a Neyman confidence interval for the fixed parameter θ is hard: you don’t know θ, but you look for disposing around it an interval with a possibly very low probability of failing. The analytical solution is allowed for a very limited number of theoretical cases. Vice versa a large variety of instances may be quickly solved in an approximate way via the central limit theorem in terms of confidence interval around a Gaussian distribution – that's the benefit. The drawback is that the central limit theorem is applicable when the sample size is sufficiently large. Therefore, it is less and less applicable with the sample involved in modern inference instances. The fault is not in the sample size on its own part. Rather, this size is not sufficiently large because of the complexity of the inference problem. With the availability of large computing facilities, scientists refocused from isolated parameters inference to complex functions inference, i.e. re sets of highly nested parameters identifying functions. In these cases we speak about learning of functions (in terms for instance of regression, neuro-fuzzy system or computational learning) on the basis of highly informative samples. A first effect of having a complex structure linking data is the reduction of the number of sample degrees of freedom, i.e. the burning of a part of sample points, so that the effective sample size to be considered in the central limit theorem is too small. Focusing on the sample size ensuring a limited learning error with a given confidence level, the consequence is that the lower bound on this size grows with complexity indices such as VC dimension or detail of a class to which the function we want to learn belongs. = Example = A sample of 1,000 independent bits is enough to ensure an absolute error of at most 0.081 on the estimation of the parameter p of the underlying Bernoulli variable with a confidence of at least 0.99. The same size cannot guarantee a threshold less than 0.088 with the same confidence 0.99 when the error is identified with the probability that a 20-year-old man living in New York does not fit the ranges of height, weight and waistline observed on 1,000 Big Apple inhabitants. The accuracy shortage occurs because both the VC dimension and the detail of the class of parallelepipeds, among which the one observed from the 1,000 inhabitants' ranges falls, are equal to 6.  The general inversion problem solving the Fisher question  With insufficiently large samples, the approach: fixed sample – random properties suggests inference procedures in three steps: { - valign=\\"top\\" 1.  Sampling mechanism. It consists of a pair (Z, g_{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\theta}), where the seed Z is a random variable without unknown parameters, while the explaining function g_{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\theta} is a function mapping from samples of Z to samples of the random variable X we are interested in. The parameter vector \\\\boldsymbol\\\\theta is a specification of the random parameter \\\\mathbf\\\\Theta. Its components are the parameters of the X distribution law. The Integral Transform Theorem ensures the existence of such a mechanism for each (scalar or vector) X when the seed coincides with the random variable U uniformly distributed in [0,1]. { - valign=\\"top\\" Example.  For X following a Pareto distribution with parameters a and k, i.e. :F_X(x)=\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{k}{x}^a\\\\right) I_{[k,\\\\infty)}(x), a sampling mechanism (U, g_{(a,k)}) for X with seed U reads: :g_{(a,k)}(u)=k (1-u)^{-\\\\frac{1}{a}}, or, equivalently, g_{(a,k)}(u)=k u^{-1/a}. } - valign=\\"top\\"  2.  Master equations. The actual connection between the model and the observed data is tossed in terms of a set of relations between statistics on the data and unknown parameters that come as a corollary of the sampling mechanisms. We call these relations master equations. Pivoting around the statistic s=h(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_m)= h(g_{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\theta}(z_1),\\\\ldots, g_{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\theta}(z_m)), the general form of a master equation is: :s= \\\\rho(\\\\boldsymbol\\\\theta;z_1,\\\\ldots,z_m). With these relations we may inspect the values of the parameters that could have generated a sample with the observed statistic from a particular setting of the seeds representing the seed of the sample. Hence, to the population of sample seeds corresponds a population of parameters. In order to ensure this population clean properties, it is enough to draw randomly the seed values and involve either sufficient statistics or, simply, well-behaved statistics w.r.t. the parameters, in the master equations. For example, the statistics s_1=\\\\sum_{i=1}^m \\\\log x_i and s_2=\\\\min_{i=1,\\\\ldots,m} \\\\\\\\{x_i\\\\\\\\} prove to be sufficient for parameters a and k of a Pareto random variable X. Thanks to the (equivalent form of the) sampling mechanism g_{(a,k)} we may read them as :s_1=m\\\\log k+1/a \\\\sum_{i=1}^m \\\\log u_i :s_2=\\\\min_{i=1,\\\\ldots,m} \\\\\\\\{k u_i^{-\\\\frac{1}{a}}\\\\\\\\}, respectively. - valign=\\"top\\"  3.  Parameter population. Having fixed a set of master equations, you may map sample seeds into parameters either numerically through a population bootstrap, or analytically through a twisting argument. Hence from a population of seeds you obtain a population of parameters. { - valign=\\"top\\" Example.  From the above master equation we can draw a pair of parameters, ( a, k), compatible with the observed sample by solving the following system of equations: : a=\\\\frac{\\\\sum\\\\log u_i-m\\\\log \\\\min \\\\\\\\{u_i\\\\\\\\}}{s_1-m\\\\log s_2}. : k=\\\\mathrm e^{\\\\frac{ a s_1-\\\\sum\\\\log u_i}{m a}} where s_1 and s_2 are the observed statistics and u_1,\\\\ldots,u_m a set of uniform seeds. Transferring to the parameters the probability (density) affecting the seeds, you obtain the distribution law of the random parameters A and K compatible with the statistics you have observed. } Compatibility denotes parameters of compatible populations, i.e. of populations that could have generated a sample giving rise to the observed statistics. You may formalize this notion as follows: } =Definition= For a random variable and a sample drawn from it a compatible distribution is a distribution having the same sampling mechanism \\\\mathcal M_X=(Z,g_{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\theta}) of X with a value \\\\boldsymbol\\\\theta of the random parameter \\\\mathbf\\\\Theta derived from a master equation rooted on a well-behaved statistic s. = Example = Joint empirical cumulative distribution function of parameters (A,K) of a Pareto random variable.Cumulative distribution function of the mean M of a Gaussian random variableYou may find the distribution law of the Pareto parameters A and K as an implementation example of the population bootstrap method as in the figure on the left. Implementing the twisting argument method, you get the distribution law F_M(\\\\mu) of the mean M of a Gaussian variable X on the basis of the statistic s_M=\\\\sum_{i=1}^m x_i when \\\\Sigma^2 is known to be equal to \\\\sigma^2 . Its expression is: :F_M(\\\\mu)=\\\\Phi\\\\left(\\\\frac{m\\\\mu- s_M}{\\\\sigma\\\\sqrt{m}}\\\\right), shown in the figure on the right, where \\\\Phi is the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal distribution. Upper (purple curve) and lower (blue curve) extremes of a 90% confidence interval of the mean M of a Gaussian random variable for a fixed \\\\sigma and different values of the statistic sm. Computing a confidence interval for M given its distribution function is straightforward: we need only find two quantiles (for instance \\\\delta/2 and 1-\\\\delta/2 quantiles in case we are interested in a confidence interval of level δ symmetric in the tail's probabilities) as indicated on the left in the diagram showing the behavior of the two bounds for different values of the statistic sm. The Achilles heel of Fisher's approach lies in the joint distribution of more than one parameter, say mean and variance of a Gaussian distribution. On the contrary, with the last approach (and above-mentioned methods: population bootstrap and twisting argument) we may learn the joint distribution of many parameters. For instance, focusing on the distribution of two or many more parameters, in the figures below we report two confidence regions where the function to be learnt falls with a confidence of 90%. The former concerns the probability with which an extended support vector machine attributes a binary label 1 to the points of the (x,y) plane. The two surfaces are drawn on the basis of a set of sample points in turn labelled according to a specific distribution law . The latter concerns the confidence region of the hazard rate of breast cancer recurrence computed from a censored sample . {  90% confidence region for the family of support vector machines endowed with hyperbolic tangent profile function  frame100px90% confidence region for the hazard function of breast cancer recurrence computed from the censored sample t=(9, 13, > 13, 18, 12, 23, 31, 34, > 45, 48, > 161),\\\\, with > t denoting a censored time }  Notes  References    Category:Machine learning ","title":"Algorithmic inference"},{"id":"20890512","text":"\\"For a Swarm of Bees\\" is an Anglo-Saxon metrical charm that was intended for use in keeping honey bees from swarming.

Background Dee Farmer = Dee Farmer, a trans woman, was convicted of credit card fraud in 1986, and was initially incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution, Oxford, a medium- security federal prison for men. Farmer was incarcerated with the general male population due to federal prison guidelines that assigned trans prisoners to facilities based on medical transition status. In 1989, Farmer was transferred to the general male population at US Penitentiary Terre Haute, Indiana, a higher security facility that housed \\"more troublesome prisoners.\\"Stacy L. Cozad, Cruel But Not So Unusual: Farmer v. Brennan and the Devolving Standards of Decency, 23 Pepp. L. Rev. 175 (1996) Within two weeks of arriving at the penitentiary, Farmer was beaten and sexually assaulted by another inmate in her cell, which potentially exposed her to HIV infection. Farmer subsequently filed a Bivens lawsuit in federal court without a lawyer, alleging that the wardens of both of her prisons and other officials within the Federal Bureau of Prisons violated her Eighth Amendment rights. In an amended filing, she specified that the prison administration was deliberately indifferent to her safety when it transferred her to a general male prison population with a history of inmate violence, knowing that she would be particularly vulnerable to rape as a trans woman. = Procedural history = District Court  The District Court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment, denying Farmer's motion to delay its ruling until the defendants complied with a discovery request. It concluded that failure to prevent inmate assaults violates the Eighth Amendment only if prison officials had \\"actual knowledge\\" of a potential danger, and that respondents lacked such knowledge because Farmer never expressed any safety concerns to them.  Court of Appeals  The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court in a short memorandum opinion, noting that any issues that could be raised on appeal were \\"insubstantial,\\" and the parties did not need to submit any briefs for the court to consider.Farmer v. Brennan, 11 F.3d 668 (7th Cir. 1992) = Consideration by the Supreme Court = Petition for certiorari  The Supreme Court granted Farmer's petition for certiorari from the Seventh Circuit decision, in order to resolve disagreement among different Courts of Appeals regarding the proper test to assess \\"deliberate indifference\\" of officials.  Merits briefs & oral arguments  After the Supreme Court granted certiorari, the ACLU National Prison Project stepped in to represent Farmer. In their briefing before the Court and at oral argument, Farmer and the ACLU argued that deliberate indifference should be defined objectively, where deliberate official indifference to obvious risks that are likely to result in the violation of constitutional rights is sufficient for a plaintiff to show an Eighth Amendment violation.Brief for Petitioner at 10-11, (No. 92-7247) This standard is akin to the recklessness standard used in civil cases. The federal government argued that the Court should adopt a test more similar to criminal recklessness, which would require that a plaintiff show that the prison official had actual knowledge of the substantial risk of serious harm.Brief for Respondents at 7-11, (No. 92-7247) ACLU attorney Elizabeth Alexander used Farmer's proper pronouns in her briefs and at oral arguments, while lawyers for the federal government used male pronouns.  Amicus briefs  Amicus briefs were filed in favor of reversing the Seventh Circuit on behalf of the Montana Defender Project, the D.C. Prisoners' Legal Services Project, and Stop Prisoner Rape. An amicus brief in favor of affirming the Seventh Circuit was filed on by the Attorney General of Maryland, which was joined by all other state attorneys general. The brief filed by Stop Prison Rape emphasized that prison rape is \\"widespread, repetitive, deadly, devastating, predictable, and preventable,\\" but is rarely reported because it is \\"ingrained in the culture of confinement, both among prisoners and prison officials.\\"\\"SPR files Brief in Farmer v. Brennan\\" (Press release). Stop Prisoner Rape (now Just Detention International). 1994-01-11. Archived from the original on 2010-11-25. Retrieved 2008-12-30. In order to address this issue, the brief asked the Court to use Farmer's case to add pressure to prison officials to bring about systemic prison reforms, and to create greater access to the courts for survivors of prison rape. Opinion of the Court The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 9–0 decision that \\"deliberate indifference\\" to a substantial risk of harm to an inmate can render a prison official liable under the Eighth Amendment. Justice David Souter wrote the majority opinion, and was joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, along with Justices Harry Blackmun, John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justices Blackmun and Stevens also wrote separate concurring opinions. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a concurring opinion joining in the judgment, but disagreed with the majority's reasoning. = Majority opinion = The majority opinion of the Court held a prison official could be held liable under the Eighth Amendment if they are \\"deliberately indifferent\\" to a substantial risk of serious harm to a prisoner. The Court explained that the Eighth Amendment requires prison officials to provide humane conditions of confinement, which includes provision of \\"adequate food, clothing, shelter, and medical care,\\" and taking \\"reasonable measures\\" to ensure inmate safety. In particular, prison officials have a duty to prevent harm from other prisoners. In order to prove that a constitutional rights violation occurred, however, an inmate must show (1) a substantial risk of serious harm and (2) that the prison official was deliberately indifferent to inmate health and safety. The Court then proceeded to clarify what qualified as \\"deliberate indifference.\\" Under the deliberate indifference standard, a prison official must actually know of and disregard an excessive risk to inmate health and safety. The Court explained that this is a subjective standard, under which the official must be aware of facts that would lead to an inference that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and then must also draw that inference. Applying this standard to Farmer's case, the Court noted that the District Court mistakenly relied on the fact that Farmer never notified the guards of her risk of being assaulted in granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment. Notification was not required under the deliberate indifference standard, and Farmer could use other circumstantial evidence to prove actual knowledge, such as admissions by prison guards that she was likely to face \\"a great deal of sexual pressure\\" in prison. Consequently, the Court vacated the judgment by the Court of Appeals and remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings. = Concurrences = Justice Blackmun  Justice Blackmun's concurring opinion went further by saying that the government was responsible for the conditions inside, regardless of a prison or government official's subjective state of mind: > Where a legislature refuses to fund a prison adequately, the resulting > barbaric conditions should not be immune from constitutional scrutiny simply > because no prison official acted culpably....The responsibility for > subminimal conditions in any prison inevitably is diffuse, and often borne > at least in part, by the legislature. Yet, regardless of what state actor or > institution caused the harm and with what intent, the experience of the > inmate is the same. A punishment is simply no less cruel or unusual because > its harm is unintended. In view of this obvious fact, there is no reason to > believe that, in adopting the Eighth Amendment, the Framers intended to > prohibit cruel and unusual punishments only when they were inflicted > intentionally.  Justice Stevens  Justice Stevens wrote a short concurring opinion noting that he agreed with Justice Blackmun, but joined in Justice Souter's majority opinion because it more closely followed the Court's precedent.  Justice Thomas  Justice Thomas concurred in the judgment only, explaining that conditions of confinement should not violate the Eighth Amendment unless they are imposed as part of a sentence. In Farmer's case, because the attack \\"was not part of his sentence, it did not constitute 'punishment' under the Eighth Amendment.\\" However, he agreed that a \\"deliberate indifference\\" standard should govern prison official liability, and therefore concurred in the Court's ruling.  Subsequent developments  Farmer on remand = The District Court again granted summary judgment against Farmer on remand. This second summary judgment was overturned by the Court of Appeals for not giving Farmer a meaningful chance to seek discovery in her case.Farmer v. Brennan, 81 F.3d 1444 (7th Cir. 1996) The subsequent trial lasted only two days, and the jury found for defendants after deliberating for one hour. The jury found that there was insufficient evidence presented to prove that Farmer's sexual assault had occurred. = Subsequent cases = Tens of thousands of cases in the lower courts have cited Farmer's case and the legal standard it established. Farmer also continues to have an impact on jailhouse lawyers. By carefully explaining how to argue constitutional violations behind bars, defining complex legal terms like “subjective recklessness” and mapping out a successful claim, Justice Souter's majority opinion serves as a roadmap for Eighth Amendment prison condition litigation. Nonetheless, the \\"actual knowledge\\" focus of the standard adopted by the Court in Brennan sets a high bar for plaintiffs that can often prove difficult to surmount. These claims became even more difficult to pursue after the Supreme Court's decision in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, which established a strict plausibility pleading standard, and makes it difficult for inmate plaintiffs to survive a motion to dismiss without clear evidence of prison officials' actual knowledge of their substantial risk of harm.Maureen Brocco, Facing the Facts: The Guarantee Against Cruel and Unusual Punishment in Light of PLRA, Iqbal, and PREA, 16 J. Gender Race & Just. 917, 921 (2013) = Legacy = Stop Prisoner Rape lauded the decision as a \\"historic breakthrough\\" in efforts to end \\"the widespread and institutionalized practice of rape of prisoners.\\"\\"Hailing Supreme Court Decision\\" (Press release).

He follows Chetta to Chandigarh but is apprehended by CBI officer Rathnavel (Vijayakanth). Rathnavel is a tasked with bringing down hoarders and black marketers of India's staple grains. Once Rathnavel realises that Chetta is a mastermind of the hoarding operation, he begins to help Devan, even hiring successful lawyer Chakravarthy (Karthik) to fight for him. The flashback shows that Devan's sister Jacqueline (Kausalya) was killed by Chetta. Earlier, Chetta and Devan were friends, but Chetta stalks and harasses Jacqueline. He peeps on her when she is bathing, and when she finds out about it, she slaps him in public. Chetta decides to take revenge. On Jacqueline's wedding day, he drugs her and sends her to church in the bridal costume with no dress underneath. Chetta then grabs her costume from the car, thus rendering her completely naked in public. He then shoots her and her groom. Devan is framed for the crime and wants to avenge his sister's death.

It was absorbed by Delta Zeta sorority.  History  The group had a succession of names. Founded on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley on 8 May, 1909, Beta Phi Alpha began as Bid-A-Wee, a group created to meet the needs of a \\"very difficult housing situation\\" (Miner, p. 144).The Spring 1995 edition of The Lamp of Delta Zeta, p.10, has an article about the sorority's several mergers. Accessed 25 Aug 2020. Through future name changes, the Fraternity continued to count its Founders Day as 8 May, 1909. The Founders were: *Edith May Harriman *Elsa Erva Meta Ludeke *Anna Belle Nelson *Hattie Belle Paul *Ida Luise Rinn *Lydia Maude TaylorFounders names, symbolism and early history according to an online blog posting, accessed 29 Aug 2020. In 1912, the name changed to Aldebaran, after the star. This change, and an expanded symbolism, mark the point where interest began among members for expansion to other campus groups. On 24 Nov, 1919, the group chose to rename themselves as a Greek letter organization with the name Kappa Phi Alpha (University of California Chronicle, p. 38). But within a year, discovering that a men's fraternity in Boston had been operating under those letters, in 1920, the sorority took on its final name, Beta Phi Alpha. The 1919 date appears to be the juncture where the group, now solidly interested in connecting with other campus organizations, began to establish structures that would aid such growth. This process was led by Mary Gordon Holway, who wrote the ritual and advocated for a Greek letter identity. Beta Phi Alpha then began the process of nationalization and expansion. In 1923, it was granted membership in the National Panhellenic Conference. Expansion was often effected by the absorption of local chapters or restless chapters of struggling non-NPC sororities. One of these was a five-year old local at the University of Minnesota called Zeta Alpha that became the Kappa chapter of Beta Phi Alpha in 1927.Kappa chapter became dormant at Minnesota in 1940, just prior to the national merger with Delta Zeta which was also present at Minnesota at that time with their Gamma chapter. Members and alumnae of Beta Phi Alpha would have been welcomed as part of the merger. That campus also hosted a chapter of Phi Omega Pi (originally Achoth) that similarly had failed four years prior to their merger with Delta Zeta in 1946. A total of thirty-five chapters were installed by 1936, but only a portion of them survived due to the economic downturn of the Great Depression. For example, in 1936, two of the six chapters of a small national sorority called Phi Delta affiliated with Beta Phi Alpha, creating chapters at New York University and George Washington University.These joined Beta Phi Alpha, according to this article on NPC organizations that no longer exist, accessed 26 Aug 2020. But it appears these did not survive, as five years later they were not reflected in the final chapter list at the time of merger with Delta Zeta. On 22 June, 1941, Beta Phi Alpha joined in a friendly merger with Delta Zeta sorority (Miner, pp. 144– 145). ΔΖ gained eight undergraduate chapters from the merger.  Legacy  Beta Phi Alpha's Convention Lights is still sung at the close of Delta Zeta national conventions. The gavel which opens Delta Zeta's convention is an artifact of Beta Phi Alpha. It was given to Beta Phi Alpha by Founder Elsa Ludeke. The gavel is inscribed with the names of both sororities' founders and national presidents (Miner, pp. 144– 145).  Final Benedictory  The Final Benedictory (~blessing) was given by Julia Wells Bower at the last Beta Phi Alpha convention in 1941: > \\"Sisters in Beta Phi Alpha, we have long traveled a star-lit road together. > We have given loving service, have formed priceless friendships, and have > learned true wisdom as we traveled that road. Now the warm glow of a > brightly burning Lamp joins the soft radiance of our star to light our path. > May we be worthy bearers of the Lamp as we are faithful followers of the > star!\\" (Miner, p. 144)  Creed  The Creed of Beta Phi Alpha was: > We believe in service, the keynote of our daily lives, the foundation of our > Fraternity and its power to reveal the worth of woman. We believe in > knowledge and its broadening influence, in understanding and unselfish love > as the creators of our happiness. We pray for grace to meet success with > humility, for strength and courage to rise above failure with spirit > renewed, for wisdom to judge man by the spiritual values he may possess. We > strive to keep faith in ourselves. We believe in the brotherhood of man and > in our kinship to God, our Creator. (Miner, p. 145)  Insignia  Delta Zeta's history book (1983) described the insignia as follows: The badge \\"was a pearled Φ with Greek letters Β and Α embossed on a field of black enamel at either side of the Φ's stem\\". Colors were Kelly green and gold. The flower was the yellow tea rose. The open motto was Scientia, Virtus, Amicitia - \\"Knowledge, Virtue, Friendship\\" The publication was Aldebaran.  Chapters  Baird's Manual (1940) notes that more than thirty chapters were established \\"with a total membership of 3,295.\\" Inactive chapters at the time of merger listed in italic.

It is located at 33°39'0N 73°31'0E with an altitude of 795 metres (2611 feet).Location of Panjar - Falling Rain Genomics The village and surrounding hamlets in the Kahuta hills in Union Council Panjar namely Khoian, Salambar, Channuian, Sorr, Salitha, Moohri, Dobairan and Keral are mostly inhabited by the Jasgam or Jaskham clan of Abbasi’s and Sattis besides some other families. The region comprises semi mountains with thick vegetation including forests. Most of the aforementioned villages are situated along Ling Valley known because of Ling Nullah carrying spring water which flows to south west and joins Sawan River at Rawalpindi. Due to lack of road connectivity, inadequate educational institutions, electricity and drinking water, major part of population relocated to Kahuta and Rawalpindi in 1980s and 1990s. Government School Panjar used to be the only High school till 1980s where students from far flung parts of UC commuted on foot for studies. A school at village Salambar has been major institution for surrounding villages as it was almost in the centre of the region. However after middle level students would either opt out of education or study in Panjar or Kahuta. In 1980s a metal road was built from Panjar to Narh which alleviated the sufferings of some part of population. Lately a new road has connected Sorr with other villages and Panjar while another road from Kahuta to Keral is also under construction. Most of the villages have been provided with electricity and drinking water through water supply schemes in recent years. Politically the Union Council has traditionally been aligned with PML (N) and current Chairman Master Zahoor Abbasi also belongs to same party. Brigadier Javed Satti who established a chain of Azeem Public Schools where quality education is given to less fortunate and financially poor children has earned huge respect among the people. Other prominent notables of the area include Raja Sultan Sabir ,Raja Muhammad Mushtaq, Raja Riaz Ahmed, Deputy Deo Ghulam Ghous Shoaib Advocate,Brigadier Jehanzeb Abbasi, Brigadier Ghulam Sarwar Abbasi, Brigadier Tabrez Abbasi, Brigadier Tahir Abbasi, Brigadier Naeem Akbar Satti, Colonel Zia Abbasi, Colonel Masood Abbasi, Col Akhtar Abbasi, Colonel Zafar Abbasi, Colonel Faiz Abbasi, Major Hafeez Abbasi, Major Saif Satti, Advocate Tariq Pervez Abbasi, Qaddus Abbasi and Major Zulfiqar Abbasi. The development work in the shape of roads, electricity and water supply schemes has started encouraging people of the area to connect with their roots, benefit from better environment and build houses in ancestral villages. Village {Khoian} is believed to have been named for numerous wells. However these exists only one well in the centre of the village. That too has not been in use because of availability of water through water supply schemes.A Government middle school each for boys and girls is there in Khoian but number of students studying there is very low as most of the population has relocated to kahuta and Rawalpindi for better schooling and job opportunities. As of April 2020 there are twelve serving & retired officers of Pakistan armed forces belonging to the village. They also include a lady and pilot in airforce. Highest rank, so far, attained by the sons of the village is brigadier.

Keene. A division of Keeneland Association, Inc., it holds three annual horse auctions that attract buyers from around the globe: *January - Horses of All Ages :This sale, as its name implies, features horses of all ages, including breeding stock, horses of racing age and short yearlings. Breeding \\"seasons\\"—the rights to breed one mare to a specified stallion in a given year—are also sold at this auction. *September - Yearling :This sale, the world's largest sale of yearlings, has been conducted at various times in the fall since 1944, and was permanently moved to September in 1960. Keeneland accepts all horses nominated to sale, making it the largest market for Thoroughbred yearlings in the world. Format changes instituted in 2010 introduced a three tier format for the sale that will differentiate animals by pedigree and conformation. \\"Select\\" sessions conducted at the beginning of the sale will be formalized, recognizing a practice present for some time. Following the Select sessions an extended 'Book 2' (offering a choicer grade of prospects) period of selling will precede the open yearling sessions that make up the latter half of the sale. In recent years, the September sale has produced multiple Kentucky Derby winners, an Epsom Derby winner, an American Horse of the Year, and a Triple Crown winner. The 2019 Sale saw a record single sale of $8.2 million for a filly offspring of Triple Crown winner American Pharoah. *November - Breeding Stock :This sale primarily features broodmares and weanlings, with some stallions, horses in training and yearlings also offered. Stallion \\"shares\\"—ownership interests in specific stallions—and seasons are also sold at this auction. Over the years, this has become the world's largest sale of Thoroughbreds. The July Selected Yearling Sale was discontinued in 2003 and the April Two-Year-Olds in Training Sale was discontinued in 2015. From 1943 to 2002, Keeneland conducted the July Selected Yearling sale. Numerous champions, including 11 Kentucky Derby winners, were sold here. The yearlings sold were selected by pedigree, and had to pass a physical conformation test before being allowed into the sales ring. When announcing changes to the format of the September Sale in March 2010, Keeneland president and CEO Nick Nicholson said consignor preference made a return of the July sale unlikely.http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse- racing/articles/55722/keeneland-adopts-new-format-for-fall-sale See also * Fasig-Tipton * Thoroughbred valuation References * Official Keeland Association, Inc.

Research in Scotland has shown that a 15-point lower IQ meant people had a fifth less chance of seeing their 76th birthday, while those with a 30-point disadvantage were 37% less likely than those with a higher IQ to live that long. Another Scottish study found that once individuals had reached old age (79 in this study), it was no longer childhood intelligence or current intelligence scores that best predicted mortality but the relative decline in cognitive abilities from age 11 to age 79. They also found that fluid abilities were better predictors of survival in old age than crystallized abilities. The relationship between childhood intelligence and mortality has even been found to hold for gifted children, those with an intelligence over 135. A 15-point increase in intelligence was associated with a decreased risk of mortality of 32%. This relationship was present until an intelligence score of 163 at which point there was no further advantage of a higher intelligence on mortality risk. A meta-analysis of the relationship between intelligence and mortality found that there was a 24% increase in mortality for a 1SD (15 point) drop in IQ score. This meta-analysis also concluded that the association between intelligence and mortality was similar for men and women despite sex differences in disease prevalence and life expectancies. A whole population follow-up over 68 years showed that the association with overall mortality was also present for most major causes of death. The exceptions were cancers unrelated to smoking and suicide There is also a strong inverse correlation between intelligence and adult morbidity. Long term sick leave in adulthood has been shown to be related to lower cognitive abilities, as has likelihood of receiving a disability pension.  Physical illness  Coronary heart disease = Among the findings of cognitive epidemiology is that men with a higher IQ have less risk of dying from coronary heart disease. The association is attenuated, but not removed, when controlling for socio-economic variables, such as educational attainment or income. This suggests that IQ may be an independent risk factor for mortality. One study found that low verbal, visuospatial and arithmetic scores were particularly good predictors of coronary heart disease. Atherosclerosis or thickening of the artery walls due to fatty substances is a major factor in heart disease and some forms of stroke. It has also been linked to lower IQ. = Obesity = Lower intelligence in childhood and adolescence correlates with an increased risk of obesity. One study found that a 15-point increase in intelligence score was associated with a 24% decrease in risk of obesity at age 51. The direction of this relationship has been greatly debated with some arguing that obesity causes lower intelligence, however, recent studies have indicated that a lower intelligence increases the chances of obesity. = Blood pressure = Higher intelligence in childhood and adulthood has been linked to lower blood pressure and a lower risk of hypertension. = Stroke = Strong evidence has been found in support of a link between intelligence and stroke, with those with lower intelligence being at greater risk of stroke. One study found visuospatial reasoning was the best predictor of stroke compared to other cognitive tests. Further this study found that controlling for socioeconomic variables did little to attenuate the relationship between visuospatial reasoning and stroke. = Cancer = Studies exploring the link between cancer and intelligence have come to varying conclusions. A few studies, which were mostly small have found an increased risk of death from cancer in those with lower intelligence. Other studies have found an increased risk of skin cancer with higher intelligence. However, on the whole most studies have found no consistent link between cancer and intelligence.  Psychiatric  Bipolar disorder and intelligence = Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder characterized by periods of elevated mood known as mania or hypomania and periods of depression. Anecdotal and biographical evidence popularized the idea that sufferers of bipolar disorder are tormented geniuses that are uniquely equipped with high levels of creativity and superior intelligence. Bipolar disorder is relatively rare, affecting only 2.5% of the population, as it is also the case with especially high intelligence. The uncommon nature of the disorder and rarity of high IQ pose unique challenges in sourcing large enough samples that are required to conduct a rigorous analysis of the association between intelligence and bipolar disorder. Nevertheless, there has been much progress starting from the mid-90s, with several studies beginning to shed a light on this elusive relationship. One such study examined individual compulsory school grades of Swedish pupils between the ages of 15 and 16 to find that individuals with excellent school performance had a nearly four times increased rate to develop a variation of bipolar disorder later in life than those with average grades. The same study also found that students with lowest grades were at a moderately increased risk of developing bipolar disorder with nearly a twofold increase when compared to average-grade students. A New Zealand study of 1,037 males and females from the 1972–1973 birth cohort of Dunedin suggests that lower childhood IQs were associated with an increased risk of developing schizophrenia spectrum disorders, major depression, and generalized anxiety disorder in adulthood; whereas higher childhood IQ predicted an increased likelihood of mania. This study only included eight cases of mania and thus should only be used to support already existing trends. In the largest study yet published analyzing the relationship between bipolar disorder and intelligence, Edinburgh University researchers looked at the link between intelligence and bipolar disorder in a sample of over one million men enlisted in the Swedish army during a 22-year follow-up period. Regression results showed that the risk of hospitalization for bipolar disorder with comorbidity to other mental health illnesses decreased in a linear pattern with an increase in IQ. However, when researchers restricted the analysis to men without any psychiatric comorbidity, the relationship between bipolar disorder and intelligence followed a J-curve. Note: Illustrative graph only – not based on actual data points, but representative of established research on the relationship between IQ and Bipolar Disorders. Please refer to Gale for further information. These findings suggest that men of extremely high intelligence are at a higher risk of experiencing bipolar in its purest form, and demands future investigation of the correlation between extreme brightness and pure bipolar. Additional support of a potential association between high intelligence and bipolar disorder comes from biographical and anecdotal evidence, and primarily focus on the relationship between creativity and bipolar disorder. Doctor Kay Redfield Jamison has been a prolific writer on the subject publishing several articles and an extensive book analyzing the relationship between the artistic temperament and mood disorders. Although a link between bipolar disorder and creativity has been established, there is no confirming evidence suggesting any significant relationship between creativity and intelligence. Additionally, even though some of these studies suggest a potential benefit to bipolar disorder in regards to intelligence, there is significant amount of controversy as to the individual and societal cost of this presumed intellectual advantage. Bipolar disorder is characterized by periods of immense pain and suffering, self-destructive behaviors, and has one of the highest mortality rates of all mental illnesses. = Schizophrenia and cognition = Schizophrenia is chronic and disabling mental illness that is characterized by abnormal behavior, psychotic episodes and inability to recognize between reality and fantasy. Even though schizophrenia can severely handicap its sufferers, there has been a great interest in the relationship of this disorder and intelligence. Interest in the association of intelligence and schizophrenia has been widespread partly stems from the perceived connection between schizophrenia and creativity, and posthumous research of famous intellectuals that have been insinuated to have suffered from the illness. Hollywood played a pivotal role popularizing the myth of the schizophrenic genius with the movie A Beautiful Mind that depicted the life story of Nobel Laureate, John Nash and his struggle with the illness. Although stories of extremely bright schizophrenic individuals such as that of John Nash do exist, they are the outliers and not the norm. Studies analyzing the association between schizophrenia and intelligence overwhelmingly suggest that schizophrenia is linked to lower intelligence and decreased cognitive functioning. Since the manifestation of schizophrenia is partly characterized by cognitive and motor declines, current research focuses on understanding premorbid IQ patterns of schizophrenia patients. In the most comprehensive meta-analysis published since the groundbreaking study by Aylward et al. in 1984, researchers at Harvard University found a medium-sized deficit in global cognition prior to the onset of schizophrenia. The mean premorbid IQ estimate for schizophrenia samples was 94.7 or 0.35 standard deviations below the mean, and thus at the lower end of the average IQ range. Additionally, all studies containing reliable premorbid and post-onset IQ estimates of schizophrenia patients found significant decline in IQ scores when comparing premorbid IQ to post-onset IQ. However, while the decline in IQ over the course of the onset of schizophrenia is consistent with theory, some alternative explanations for this decline suggested by the researchers include the clinical state of the patients and/or side effects of antipsychotic medications. A recent study published in March 2015 edition of the American Journal of Psychiatry suggests that not only there is no correlation between high IQ and schizophrenia, but rather that a high IQ may be protective against the illness. Researchers from the Virginia Commonwealth University analyzed IQ data from over 1.2 million Swedish males born between 1951 and 1975 at ages 18 to 20 years old to investigate future risk of schizophrenia as a function of IQ scores. The researchers created stratified models using pairs of relatives to adjust for family clusters and later applied regression models to examine the interaction between IQ and genetic predisposition to schizophrenia. Results from the study suggest that subjects with low IQ were more sensitive to the effect of genetic liability to schizophrenia than those with high IQ and that the relationship between IQ and schizophrenia is not a consequence of shared genetic or familial-environmental risk factors, but may instead be causal. = Post- traumatic stress disorder and traumatic exposure = The Archive of General Psychiatry published a longitudinal study of a randomly selected sample of 713 study participants (336 boys and 377 girls), from both urban and suburban settings. Of that group, nearly 76 percent had suffered through at least one traumatic event. Those participants were assessed at age 6 years and followed up to age 17 years. In that group of children, those with an IQ above 115 were significantly less likely to have Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result of the trauma, less likely to display behavioral problems, and less likely to experience a trauma. The low incidence of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder among children with higher IQs was true even if the child grew up in an urban environment (where trauma averaged three times the rate of the suburb), or had behavioral problems. = Other disorders = Post-traumatic stress disorder, severe depression, and schizophrenia are less prevalent in higher IQ bands. Some studies have found that higher IQ persons show a higher prevalence of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, but a 2017 meta study found the opposite, that people who suffered from OCD had slightly lower average IQs.  Substance abuse  Substance abuse is a patterned use of drug consumption in which a person uses substances in amounts or with methods that are harmful to themselves or to others. Substance abuse is commonly associated with a range of maladaptive behaviors that are both detrimental to the individual and to society. Given the terrible consequences that can transpire from abusing substances, recreational experimentation and/or recurrent use of drugs are traditionally thought to be most prevalent among marginalized strands of society. Nevertheless, the very opposite is true; research both in national and individual levels have found that the relationship between IQ and substance abuse indicates positive correlations between superior intelligence, higher alcohol consumption and drug consumption. Note: Illustrative graph only – not based on actual data points, but accurate to trends previously established between alcohol consumption and national IQ. For actual data points please refer to Belasen and Hafer 2013 publication. A significant positive association between worldwide national alcohol consumption per capita and country level IQ scores has been found. The relationship between childhood IQ scores and illegal drugs use by adolescence and middle age has been found. High IQ scores at age 10 are positively associated with intake of cannabis, cocaine (only after 30 years of age), ecstasy, amphetamine and polydrug and also highlight a stronger association between high IQ and drug use for women than men. Additionally, these findings are independent of socio-economic status or psychological distress during formative years. A high IQ at age 11 was predictive of increased alcohol dependency later in life and a one standard deviation increase in IQ scores (15-points) was associated with a higher risk of illegal drug use. The counterintuitive nature of the correlation between high IQ and substance abuse has sparked a fervent debate in the scientific community with some researchers attributing these findings to IQ being an inadequate proxy of intelligence, while others fault employed research methodologies and unrepresentative data. However, with the increased number of studies publishing similar results, overwhelming consensus is that the association between high IQ and substance abuse is real, statistically significant and independent of other variables. There are several competing theories trying to make sense of this apparent paradox. Doctor James White postulates that people with higher IQs are more critical of information and thus less likely to accept facts at face value. While marketing campaigns against drugs may deter individuals with lower IQs from using drugs with disjoint arguments or over-exaggeration of negative consequences, people with a higher IQ will seek to verify the validity of such claims in their immediate environment. White also eludes to an often-overlooked problem of people with higher IQ, the lack of adequate challenges and intellectual stimulation. White posits that high IQ individuals that are not sufficiently engaged in their lives may choose to forgo good judgment for the sake of stimulation. The most prominent theory attempting to explain the positive relationship between IQ and substance abuse; however, is the Savanna–IQ interaction hypothesis by social psychologist Satoshi Kanazawa. The theory is founded on the assumption that intelligence is a domain-specific adaptation that has evolved as humans moved away from the birthplace of human race, the savanna. Therefore, theory follows that as humans explored beyond the savannas, intelligence rather than instinct dictated survival. Natural selection privileged those who possessed high IQ while simultaneously favoring those with an appetite for evolutionary novel behaviors and experiences. For Kanazawa, this drive to seek evolutionary novel activities and sensations translates to being more open and callous about experimenting with and/or abusing substances in modern culture. For all the attention that the Savanna–IQ interaction hypothesis has garnered with the general public, this theory however, receives equal amounts of praise and criticism in the academic community with key pain points being the fact that humans have continued to evolve after moving away from the savannas and Kanazawa's misattribution of aspects of the openness personality trait to being indicative of superior general intelligence.  Dementia  A decrease in IQ has also been shown as an early predictor of late-onset Alzheimer's Disease and other forms of dementia. In a 2004 study, Cervilla and colleagues showed that tests of cognitive ability provide useful predictive information up to a decade before the onset of dementia. However, when diagnosing individuals with a higher level of cognitive ability, a study of those with IQ's of 120 or more, patients should not be diagnosed from the standard norm but from an adjusted high-IQ norm that measured changes against the individual's higher ability level. In 2000, Whalley and colleagues published a paper in the journal Neurology, which examined links between childhood mental ability and late-onset dementia. The study showed that mental ability scores were significantly lower in children who eventually developed late-onset dementia when compared with other children tested.  Health related behaviors  Alcohol = The relationship between alcohol consumption and intelligence is not straightforward. In some cohorts higher intelligence has been linked to a reduced risk of binge drinking. In one Scottish study higher intelligence was linked to a lower chance of binge drinking; however, units of alcohol consumed were not measured and alcohol induced hangovers in middle age were used as a proxy for binge drinking. Several studies have found the opposite effect with individuals of higher intelligence being more likely to drink more frequently, consume more units and have a higher risk of developing a drinking problem, especially in women. = Drugs = In U.S. study the link between drug intake and intelligence suggests that individuals with lower IQ take more drugs. However, in the UK the opposite relationship has been found with higher intelligence being related to greater illegal drug use. = Smoking = The relationship between intelligence and smoking has changed along with public and government attitudes towards smoking. For people born in 1921 there was no correlation between intelligence and having smoked or not smoked; however, there was a relationship between higher intelligence and quitting smoking by adulthood. In another British study, high childhood IQ was shown to inversely correlate with the chances of starting smoking. = Diet = One British study found that high childhood IQ was shown to correlate with one's chance of becoming a vegetarian in adulthood. Those of higher intelligence are also more likely to eat a healthier diet including more fruit and vegetables, fish, poultry and wholemeal bread and to eat less fried food. = Exercise = Higher intelligence has been linked to exercising. More intelligent children tend to exercise more as adults and to exercise vigorously. A study of 11,282 individuals in Scotland who took intelligence tests at ages 7, 9 and 11 in the 1950s and 1960s, found an \\"inverse linear association\\" between childhood intelligence and hospital admissions for injuries in adulthood. The association between childhood IQ and the risk of later injury remained even after accounting for factors such as the child's socioeconomic background.  Socioeconomic status  Practically all indicators of physical health and mental competence favour people of higher socioeconomic status (SES). Social class attainment is important because it can predict health across the lifespan, where people from lower social class have higher morbidity and mortality.Adler, N. E., Boyce, T., Chesney, M. A., Cohen, S., Folkman, S., Kahn, R. L., & Syme, S. L. (1994). Socioeconomic Status and Health: The Challenge of the Gradient. American Psychologist, 15–24. SES and health outcomes are general across time, place, disease, and are finely graded up the SES continuum. Gottfredson argues that general intelligence (g) is the fundamental cause for health inequality. The argument is that g is the fundamental cause of social class inequality in health, because it meets six criteria that every candidate for the cause must meet: stable distribution over time, is replicable, is a transportable form of influence, has a general effect on health, is measurable, and is falsifiable. Stability: Any casual agent has to be persistent and stable across time for its pattern of effects to be general over ages and decades. Large and stable individual differences in g are developed by adolescence and the dispersion of g in population's intelligence present in every generation, no matter what social circumstances are present. Therefore, equalizing socioeconomic environments does very little to reduce the dispersion in IQ. The dispersion of IQ in a society in general is more stable, than its dispersion of socioeconomic status. Replicability: Siblings who vary in IQ also vary in socioeconomic success which can be comparable with strangers of comparable IQ. Also, g theory predicts that if genetic g is the principal mechanism carrying socioeconomic inequality between generations, then the maximum correlation between the parent and child SES will be near to their genetic correlation for IQ (.50). Transportability: The performance and functional literacy studies both illustrated how g is transportable across life situations and it represents a set of largely generalizable reasoning and problem-solving skills. G appear to be linearly linked to performance in school, jobs and achievements. Generality: Studies show that IQ measured at the age of 11 predicted longevity, premature death, lung and stomach cancers, dementia, loss of functional independence, more than 60 years later. Research has shown that higher IQ at age 11 is significantly related to higher social class in midlife. Therefore, it is safe to assume that higher SES, as well as higher IQ, generally predicts better health. Measurability: g factor can be extracted from any broad set of mental tests and has provided a common, reliable source for measuring general intelligence in any population. Falsifiability: theoretically, if g theory would conceive health self-care as a job, as a set of instrumental tasks performed by the individuals, it could predict g to influence the health performance in the same way as it predicts performance in education and job. Chronic illnesses are the major illnesses in developed countries today, and their major risk factors are health habits and lifestyle. The higher social strata knows the most and the lower social strata knows the least, whether class is assessed by education, occupation or income and even when the information seems to be most useful for the poorest. Higher g promotes more learning, and it increases exposure to learning opportunities. So, the problem is not in the lack of access to health-care, but the patient's failure to use it effectively when delivered. Low literacy has been associated with low use of preventive care, poor comprehension of one's illness – even when care is free. Health self-management is important because literacy provides the ability to acquire new information and complete complex tasks and that limited problem solving abilities make low-literacy patients less likely to change their behaviour on the basis of new information. Chronic lack of good judgement and effective reasoning leads to chronically poor self- management.  Explanations of the correlation between intelligence and health  There have been many reasons posited for the links between health and intelligence. Although some have argued that the direction is one in which health has an influence on intelligence, most have focused on the influence of intelligence on health. Although health may definitely affect intelligence, most of the cognitive epidemiological studies have looked at intelligence in childhood when ill health is far less frequent and a more unlikely cause of poor intelligence. Thus most explanations have focused on the effects intelligence has on health through its influence on mediating causes. Various explanations for these findings have been proposed: > \\"First, ...intelligence is associated with more education, and thereafter > with more professional occupations that might place the person in healthier > environments. ...Second, people with higher intelligence might engage in > more healthy behaviours. ...Third, mental test scores from early life might > act as a record of insults to the brain that have occurred before that date. > ...Fourth, mental test scores obtained in youth might be an indicator of a > well-put-together system. It is hypothesized that a well-wired body is more > able to respond effectively to environmental insults...\\" = System integrity hypothesis vs evolution hypothesis = The System integrity hypothesis posits that childhood intelligence is just one aspect of a well wired and well-functioning body and suggests that there is a latent trait that encompasses intelligence, health and many other factors. This trait indexes how well the body is functioning and how well the body can respond to change and return to a normal balance again (allostatic load). According to the system integrity hypothesis lower IQ does not cause mortality but instead poor system integrity causes lower intelligence and poorer health as well as a range of other traits which can be thought of as markers of system integrity. Professor Ian Deary has proposed that fluctuating asymmetry, speed of information processing, physical co-ordination, physical strength, metabolic syndrome and genetic correlation may be further potential markers of system integrity which by definition should explain a large part of or nullify the relationship between intelligence and mortality. An opposing theory to the system integrity theory is the evolutionary novelty theory which suggests that those with higher intelligence are better equipped to deal with evolutionary novel events. It is proposed that intelligence evolved to tackle evolutionarily novel situations and that those with a higher IQ are better able to process when such a novel situation is dangerous or a health hazard and thus are likely to be in better health. This theory provides a theoretical background for evidence found that supports the idea that intelligence is related to mortality through health behaviours such as wearing a seatbelt or quitting smoking. Evolutionary novelty theory emphasises the role of behaviour in the link between mortality and intelligence whereas system integrity emphasis the role of genes. Thus system integrity predicts that individuals of higher intelligence will be better protected from diseases that are caused primarily by genetics whereas evolutionary adaptive theory suggests that individuals of higher intelligence will be better protected from diseases that are less heritable and are caused by poor life choices. One study which tested this idea looked at the incidence of heritable and non-heritable cancers in individuals of differing levels of intelligence. They found that those of higher intelligence were less likely to suffer from cancer that was not heritable, that was based on lifestyle, thus supporting the evolutionary novelty theory. However this was only a preliminary study and only included the disease cancer, which has been found in previous studies to have an ambiguous relationship with intelligence. = Disease and injury prevention = Having higher intelligence scores may mean that individuals are better at preventing disease and injury. Their cognitive abilities may equip them with a better propensity for understanding the injury and health risks of certain behaviours and actions. Fatal and non-fatal accidental injury have been associated with lower intelligence. This may be because individuals of higher intelligence are more likely to take precautions such as wearing seat belts, helmets etc. as they are aware of the risks. Further there is evidence that more intelligent people behave in a healthier way. Individuals with higher cognitive abilities are also better equipped for dealing with stress, a factor that has been implemented in many health problems ranging from anxiety to cardiovascular disease. It has been suggested that higher intelligence leads to a better sense of control over one's own life and a reduction in feelings of stress. One study found that individuals with lower intelligence experienced a greater number of functional somatic symptoms, symptoms that cannot be explained by organic pathology and are thought to be stress related. However most of the relationship was mediated by work conditions. = Disease and injury management = There is evidence that higher intelligence is related to better self-care when one has an illness or injury. One study asked participants to take aspirin or a placebo on a daily basis during a study on cardiovascular health. Participants with higher intelligence persisted with taking the medication for longer than those with lower intelligence indicating that they could care for themselves better. Studies have shown that individuals with lower intelligence have lower health literacy and a study looking at the link between health literacy and actual health found that it was mediated almost entirely by intelligence. It has been claimed that up to a third of medications are not taken correctly and thus jeopardize the patients' health. This is particularly relevant for those with heart problems as the misuse of some heart medications can actually double the risk of death. More intelligent individuals also make use of preventative healthcare more often for example visiting the doctors. Some have argued however that this is an artefact of higher SES; that those with lower intelligence tend to be from a lower social class and have less access to medical facilities. However it has been found that even when access to healthcare is equal, those with lower intelligence still make less use of the services. = Psychiatric illness = A diagnosis of any mental illness, even mild psychological distress is linked to an increased risk of illness and premature death. The majority of psychiatric illness' are also linked to lower intelligence. Thus it has been proposed that psychiatric morbidity may be another pathway through which intelligence and mortality are related. Despite this the direction of causation between Intelligence and mental health issues has been disputed. Some argue that mental health issues such as depression and schizophrenia may cause a decline in mental functioning and thus scores on intelligence tests whilst others believe that it is lower intelligence that effects likelihood of developing a mental health issue. Although evidence for both points of view has been found, most of the cognitive epidemiological studies are carried out using intelligence scores from childhood, when the psychiatric condition was not present, ensuring that it was not the condition which caused the lower scores. This link has been shown to explain part of the relationship between childhood intelligence and mortality, however the amount of variance explained varies from less than 10 percent to about 5 percent. = Socioeconomic position in adulthood = Although childhood economic status may be seen as a confounder in the relationship between intelligence and mortality, as it is likely to affect intelligence, it is likely that adult SES mediates the relationship. The idea is that intelligent children will find themselves getting a better education, better jobs and will settle in a safer and healthier environment. They will have better access to health resources, good nutrition and will be less likely to experience the hazards and health risks associated with living in poorer neighbourhoods. Several studies have found that there is an association between adult SES and mortality. = Proposed general fitness factor of both cognitive ability and health, the f-factor = Because of the above-mentioned findings, some researchers have proposed a general factor of fitness analogous to the g-factor for general mental ability/intelligence. This factor is supposed to combine fertility factors, health factors, and the g-factor. For instance, one study found a small but significant correlation between three measures of sperm quality and intelligence.

The Witches' Cottage, where the Bricket Wood coven met to celebrate the sabbats and esbats The Bricket Wood coven, or Hertfordshire coven Page 289 was a coven of Gardnerian witches founded in the 1940s by Gerald Gardner. It was notable for being the first coven in the Gardnerian line, though having its supposed origins in the pre-Gardnerian New Forest coven. The coven formed after Gardner bought the Fiveacres Country Club, a naturist club in the village of Bricket Wood, Hertfordshire, southern England, and met within the club's grounds. It played a significant part in the history of the neopagan religion of Wicca. Many important and influential figures in Wicca were members of the coven, including Dafo, Doreen Valiente, Jack Bracelin, Fred Lamond, Dayonis, Eleanor Bone and Lois Bourne. The coven is still active today, though it maintains secrecy and its history is only known up until the 1970s. Chapter 11 and 12 History1940s= Gardner founded the coven around 1946 after moving to the area from the New Forest with his wife Donna. In the New Forest, Gardner claimed to have been initiated into the New Forest coven, where he learned the mysteries and practices of the witchcraft religion. Gardner, fearing that the \\"Old Religion\\", as he called it, would die out, decided to form a new coven near to his new home, where he could initiate more people into the craft and keep it alive. Gardner acted as the coven's High Priest, with Dafo acting as High Priestess. She had also been a member of the New Forest coven. Dafo remained a member of the coven until she left it by late 1952, annoyed at Gardner for seeking publicity. Gardner gained several members to the coven, all of whom were either members of the Fiveacres naturist club or were already witches, Page 60 although Donna, Gardner's wife, never got involved, having no interest in witchcraft. They held their meetings on the grounds of the local wooded Fiveacres nudist club, which Gardner had purchased in 1945. He was himself not interested in running the club, and as such appointed an administrator to take on the job.Fifty Years of Wicca, Frederic Lamond, page 30-31 Gardner re-assembled what he called \\"The Witches' Cottage\\" on a plot of land which he owned in the club grounds. The small cottage was decorated with magical sigils on the inside. He had purchased this building from a friend, the Freemason John S.M. Ward, who was a pioneer of the restoration of historical buildings.The Rebirth of Witchcraft, Doreen Valiente, page 56 It was within this 16th-century cottage that Ward had found near to Ledbury, Herefordshire that the coven assembled to perform their rituals. =1950s=Doreen Valiente, 1953-1957 Doreen Valiente, whom Gardner had initiated into the craft at Midsummer 1953 at the home of Dafo in the New Forest, joined the coven, and rose to become High Priestess. In 1956, Jack Bracelin was initiated into the coven.https://wiccanrede.org/2017/05/feature-a-meeting- with-dayonis-morgana-october-2016/ He became a favourite of Gardner, who gave him the job of running the Fiveacres club after sacking the previous administrator, who \\"had deliberately run the club at a loss by setting unrealistically high requirements for membership, hoping thereby to persuade Gerald to eventually sell him the club at a low price\\".Fifty Years of Wicca, Frederic Lamond, page 31 The sacked administrator had felt scorned, and convinced the president of the Central Council of British Naturism, Ernest Stanley, that the club was a cover for witchcraft, and that they should not be allowed membership to the CCOBN. Hoping to help Jack and Gardner's club out, the coven performed a ritual, and the situation was resolved.Fifty Years of Wicca, Frederic Lamond, page 31-32 In the mid-1950s, Gardner began to encourage more publicity, something which annoyed many coven members. In 1957, Valiente and several other coven members confronted Gardner over this, claiming that they should have a set of rules to regulate such a thing. Gardner, in response, brought about the Wiccan Laws (not to be confused with the Wiccan Rede), which offended Valiente, and in 1957 she and many of the group's older members left to form their own coven. The split-off coven asked if they could continue to use the Witches' Cottage for their rituals, but in a letter Gardner replied that: Gardner was left with a much younger coven, composed of Dayonis, her then partner Jack Bracelin, Fred Lamond, a hospital anaesthetist, and a new initiate.Fifty Years of Wicca, Frederic Lamond, page 10 Dayonis, 1958-1959 With Valiente gone, Dayonis took over as the high priestess of the coven in January 1958.Fifty Years of Wicca, Frederic Lamond, page 26 With Dayonis in charge, Gardner asked her to immediately initiate anyone who asked into the craft, in contrast with his former belief that prospective candidates should wait for a year and a day before initiation. One such of these new fast-tracked initiates was Fred Lamond, who was initiated only four months after meeting the coven for the first time.Fifty Years of Wicca, Frederic Lamond, page 17 Gardner also insisted on the initiation of Eleanor Bone, despite the fact that the coven members felt that they \\"simply couldn't circle with her\\" because of differences in exuberance. Within a month, Gardner had brought about her 2nd and 3rd initiations, and set her up as the High Priestess of a new coven, independent of the Bricket Wood one.Fifty Years of Wicca, Frederic Lamond, page 17-18 In spring 1958, whilst Gardner was away from the coven staying at his museum on the Isle of Man, the other members decided that they did not want to continue using only binding and scourging to raise energies, and so they tried to do so by the circle dance method, which most found to be more effective than Gardner's preferred methods.Fifty Years of Wicca, Frederic Lamond, page 20-21 At the same time, the group decided that they wanted to celebrate the solstices and the equinoxes as well as the cross-quarter days (the coven at the time called them Halloween, Candlemass, Beltane and Lammas). Gardner gave his written permission for this, and it was adopted by other practitioners of the craft, such as Doreen Valiente.Fifty Years of Wicca, Frederic Lamond, page 16-17 This was the beginning of the belief in the Wiccan Wheel of the Year. Dayonis moved to Canada in October 1959, and Lois Bourne became the coven's high priestess.Fifty Years of Wicca, Frederic Lamond, page 37 =1960s= After Gardner's death in 1964, Jack Bracelin, who had remained loyal to Gardner throughout, took over the group as high priest. At the same time he inherited the Fiveacres club from Gardner. However, he soon left the coven and abandoned the craft; this, according to coven member Fred Lamond, was because \\"he asked himself whether the Book of Shadows' simplified ceremonial magic rituals expressed his own religious feelings, and concluded they did not\\".Fifty Years of Wicca, Frederic Lamond, 2004, page 37 The coven continued to assemble at the Witches' Cottage, which Bracelin allowed them to use as long as they paid rent on it. Many coven members were not happy with this, as they were not members of the nudist club, though they did so anyway. =1970s= In 1972, the group stopped using the Witches' Cottage all year round, and instead started meeting at the north London home of the High priest and priestess during winter.Fifty Years of Wicca, Frederic Lamond, page 38 In 1975, Bracelin tried to get the group to pay for the nudist club's electricity as well as paying rent; the coven members were unwilling to do this, and so they sold their plot to another club member.Fifty Years of Wicca, Frederic Lamond, 2004, page 38 References Category:Gardnerian Wicca Category:Neopagan buildings Category:Neopagan organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:Religious buildings and structures in England Category:Wicca in the United Kingdom Category:Wiccan covens ","title":"Bricket Wood coven"},{"id":"20890964","text":"Jiří Vrdlovec (born June 29, 1956) is a Czechoslovak sprint canoer and marathon canoeist who competed in the early to mid-1980s.

It is located on the south bank of the River Waveney, opposite Diss and adjacent to the Great Eastern Main Line. Palgrave has a small primary school, and church located opposite, and is situated approximately 1 mile from Diss. It also has a green, park, pond, and cemetery. Palgrave has a population of 905 people in 366 households, according to the 2011 Census. Palgrave shares a significant historical link with its West/East road linking Great Yarmouth and St. Edmunds in the Domesday period.  History  In the 1870s, Palgrave was described as: > \\"Palgrave, a village and a parish in Hartismere district, Suffolk. The > village stands near the boundary with Norfolk, 1 mile S w of Diss r. > station, and 4 N W of Eye; and has a Wall letter-box under Diss. The parish > comprises 1, 474 acres. Real property, £3, 601. Pop., 739. Houses, 160\\". 336x336pxThe most common occupation found in Palgrave was agriculture, acquired by men over the age of 20 years in 1881. This particular region was found to be ideal for agricultural purposes, due to its location near the River Waverney being a direct source of water. Comparatively, the female population of Palgrave in 1881 shared large proportion of occupations surrounding the domestic and professional roles in the society, accounting for 70% in the professional industry alone as shown in the graph present.A 20th Century Boundary Map of Palgrave, Suffolk. However, there is a significant amount of the population of Palgrave that has an unknown occupation, accounting for 17.4% of the total population (124 people) in 1881. This unknown occupational data would make it difficult to establish the overall class of the Palgrave, however it could be understood that the local society around 1881 was of a lower, working class, due to the large proportion of occupations being in labour roles such as agriculture, domestic and craftsmanship.  Demographics  The ethnic composition of Palgrave is largely dominated by the ethnic group listed as 'White; English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish/British', with 871 (96.2%) of the population falling under this category. This is followed by the second most prominent ethnic group listed as 'White; Other White' with 21 (2.3%) of the population. The other ethnic groups in Palgrave could be classed as minorities, which include White; Irish (0.3%), Mixed/Multiple Ethnic Groups; White and Black Caribbean (0.1%), Mixed/Multiple Ethnic Groups; White and Asian (0.5%), Asian/Asian British (0.3%); Other Asian and Black/African/Caribbean/Black British; Caribbean (0.1%).353x353px As the neighbouring graph identifies, the total population of Palgrave from 1811 has fluctuated slightly, but has shown a gradual increase in population from 580 (1811) to 905 (2011). It is clear that a slight dip in the 1961 period saw a rapid increase in the population till 2011 where it reached its peak of 905 people. There are few religions in Palgrave, with the main religion being Christianity accounting for 62.3% (561 people) of the total population. This is followed by 257 people (28.3%) classed under the 'No Religion' category collated by the 2011 census.  Education  Palgrave has one primary school, Palgrave Church of England Voluntary Controlled Primary School. It has a total of 46 mixed gender pupils ranging from 4–11 years old. Although it is smaller than the average sized primary school, they use the supplements of Palgrave's local community centre, Church and village green to pursue in various activities. Ofsted have classed Palgrave Church of England Voluntary Controlled Primary School as a 'Good' school, when it was last inspected in May 2012.  Transport and housing  There is a total of 378 dwellings in Palgrave according to the 2011 Census report. This is a significant increase when comparing it with the data from 1831, where only 99 households were present in the parish. This increase in housing correlates with the total population increase shown in the graph above, therefore the increase of people living in Palgrave encouraged more houses to be built in the area to satisfy the increasing population. Palgrave is situated around 1.6 miles from the nearest train station that is Diss train station. The bus servises are operated by Botesdate Parish Council and operate on a weekly basis with services towards Diss train station.

In general, these are the major payment clearing systems or real-time gross settlement systems of individual countries, but in the case of Europe, there are certain pan-European payment systems. TARGET2 is a pan-European SIPS dealing with major inter-bank payments. STEP2, operated by the Euro Banking Association is a major pan- European clearing system for retail payments which has the potential to become a SIPS. In the event of a bank failure, adherence to the rules for the operation of SIPS should prevent a domino effect whereby payment obligations of the failing bank are effected against the solvent banks. Clearly, this does not prevent the effects of a bank failure from spreading; however, it closes off one route. Operation of a SIPS In 2001, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) issued the \\"Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems\\", and these are summarised below. In certain banking circles, these have become known as the 10 Commandments. In 2003 the European Central Bank (ECB) further elaborated on how the principles should be applied in Euro retail payment systems. Subsequently, in response to the perceived increased risks of terrorist attacks, the ECB in 2006 published detailed oversight expectations for business continuity planning, greatly expanding on core principle number 7. BIS added an additional recommendation in relation to countries which use cheques. It urged the operators of cheque clearing to have special regard to the fact that cheques may be dishonoured and returned some days after presentation, and this poses special risks. This is particularly relevant to countries such as Britain, Ireland, France, and US and should be regarded as the 11th commandment of payments. BIS CPSS is currently preparing for the new global standards for not only payment systems but also securities settlement systems, central counterparties and trade repositories. The new standards (Principles for FMI) is now under market consultation and going to be published in 2012. Core principles A systemically important payment system (SIPS) should have: # A well-founded legal basis # Rules and procedures which enable participants to have a clear understanding of the system’s impact on each of the financial risks they incur through participation in it. # Clearly defined procedures for the management of credit risks and liquidity risks, which specify the respective responsibilities of the system operator and the participants and which provide appropriate incentives to manage and contain those risks # Prompt final settlement on the day of value, preferably during the day and at a minimum at the end of the day. # Where multilateral netting takes place, it should, at a minimum be capable of ensuring the timely completion of daily settlements in the event of an inability to settle by the participant with the largest single settlement obligation # Assets used for settlement should preferably be a claim on the central bank; where other assets are used, they should carry little or no credit risk and little or no liquidity risk # A high degree of security and operational reliability, and contingency arrangements for timely completion of daily processing # Practical for its users and efficient for the economy # Objective and publicly disclosed criteria for participation, which permit fair and open access # Governance arrangements which are effective, accountable and transparent See also * List of systemically important banks * Systemic risk * Systemically important financial market utility * Systemically important financial institution  References  Category:Financial regulation Category:Systemic risk ","title":"Systemically important payment systems"},{"id":"20891045","text":"Vånga is a locality situated in Norrköping Municipality, Östergötland County, Sweden with 220 inhabitants in 2010.

The large and slow turning turbines of this offshore wind farm near Copenhagen take advantage of the moderate yet constant breezes at this location. While the wind at this location is not strong it is very consistent, with the turbines generating substantial power over 97 percent of the time. Middelgrunden is an offshore wind farm in the Øresund 3.5 km outside Copenhagen, Denmark. When it was built in 2000, it was the world's largest offshore farm, with 20 turbines (2 MW Bonus each) and a capacity of 40 MW. The farm delivers about 4% of the power for Copenhagen. In 1996, the project was initiated by the Copenhagen Environment and Energy Office (CEEO) after Middelgrunden had been listed as a potential site in the Danish Action Plan for Offshore Wind. Together with the CEEO a group of local people formed the Middelgrunden Wind Turbine Cooperative and established a cooperation with Copenhagen Energy, the local electric utility. The proposed location was initially opposed by the Danish Society for Nature Conservation, but this decision was later changed. Concrete gravity base foundations were chosen as the cheapest option.Larsen, Jens H. The World´s largest off-shore windfarm, Middelgrunden 40MW Copenhagen Environment and Energy Office (CEEO), 2001.

Unaware he has been infected with a dangerous virus, he tries to impress Maria, a pretty waitress at the local diner, who is romantically involved with Allen Greenfield.

History  The sorority originally formed as Achoth' (' signifying one's blood sister or a female relative), created on the campus of the University of Nebraska on March 15, 1910. The fifteen founding sisters were all members in good standing of the Order of the Eastern Star. In a letter to the fraternity, Jessie Downing explained to Sigma Phi Epsilon that Achoth \\"is similar to that of the Acacia fraternity, but in no way are the two connected\\". In 1911, it was officially recognized by the Order of the Eastern Star organization and only Eastern Star members were permitted to join. Chapters were named in Hebrew alphabetic order, The first chapter was Aleph (Nebraska), the second Beth (Iowa), etc. The sorority published a magazine called the Kochev. Sources from various fraternal organization demonstrate that Achoth was functioning as a typical collegiate sorority. The Trident of Delta Delta Delta (1920) recorded Achoth's petition for admission to the National Panhellenic Congress, but that this was denied (The Adelphean, 1921). The original Achoth sorority pin, used prior to the name change to Phi Omega Pi. Achoth may have changed their official name as early as 1922. Kappa Sigma's Caduceus (1922) reported that the \\"Supreme Governing Council of Achoth announces the change of the name 'Achoth' to 'Phi Omega Pi' fraternity.\\" Other contemporary publications refer to Achoth as Achoth, e.g. \\"A chapter of Achoth, the organization of Eastern Star members, was installed last March\\" (IU Alumni Quarterly, 1922). The chapters were renamed according to the Greek alphabet and the sorority's periodical was renamed from Kochev to The Pentagon (Miner, p. 146). In 1933, Phi Omega Pi dropped the Masonic requirement and was thus given full membership into the National Panhellenic Conference.Phi Omega Pi history Accessed December 30, 2008 That same year, the sorority absorbed two other organizations. Sigma Phi Beta was a national group with ten chapters. Founded on November 1, 1920 at New York University as Sigma Sigma Omicron, in July 1927 its name was changed to Sigma Phi Beta (Miner, p. 148). Additionally, Phi Alpha Chi, formed at the University of California at Berkeley, was founded as The Tanewah in 1919. In 1926, that group renamed itself as the Alpha chapter of Phi Alpha Chi. They joined with Sigma Phi Beta just prior to the merger into Phi Omega Pi (Miner, p. 148).The Spring 1995 edition of The Lamp of Delta Zeta, p.10, has an article about the sorority's several mergers. Accessed 25 Aug 2020. One source describes a relatively uncomplicated merger: Miner (p. 146) explained that \\"after 1933, Achoth, Tanewah, Phi Alpha Chi, and Sigma Phi Beta members were all sisters in Phi Omega Pi. In the 1937 Pentagon, sixteen collegiate and 39 alumnae chapters and clubs were listed.\\" However Baird's Manual (20th ed.) notes: > \\"The chapters at Iowa State Teachers College, Newark State Normal and > Montclair Teachers College were placed on the inactive list by order of the > Panhellenic Congress when [in 1933] Phi Omega Pi joined it. In the period > following, chapters were taken over by Alpha Omicron Pi, Alpha Gamma Delta, > Sigma Kappa, and Kappa Alpha Theta. The group disbanded in 1946. Through an > NPC committee, Delta Zeta was asked to consider the alumnae and a few > chapters which remained. [Thus, i]n 1946, the members of ΦΩΠ were accepted > into Delta Zeta sorority. It appears, therefore, that the chapters which were dropped as part of negotiations to join the Panhellenic Congress had come from Sigma Phi Beta, and were not original Achoth or Phi Omega Pi chapters.  Crest, Colors and Flower  As described by Miner, \\"[The crest of Phi Omega Pi] had a sapphire blue ground crossed by an inverted chevron of white upon which were placed five five pointed stars. Below the chevron and to the left was placed the sword and veil and to the right the lily of the valley with five bells. Above the chevron was the Roman numeral X. Surmounting the shield a crown below which was a rod. Beneath the shield a white ribbon upon which are the Greek letters ΦΩΠ.\\" The colors were sapphire blue and white. The official flower was the lily-of-the-valley.  Pins  While the sorority was known as Achoth, the badge and its symbolism were described as follows: \\"...the pin bore the Hebrew characters Shin, Nun, Aleph, the initial letters of the organization's motto, but in 1920 the letters were changed to Greek, and in October of 1922, the name was changed to correspond with the letters on the pin. The chapters formerly were named in the order of the Hebrew alphabet, but with the change of name, they automatically took [names based on] the Greek alphabet.\\" This change occurred at the 1921 convention in Minneapolis. Thus the badge of Phi Omega Pi became \\"an irregular pentagon. The center was raised and in black enamel. The upper section was surmounted by a raised five pointed star set with a blue sapphire [above the letters ΦΩΠ engraved in gold.] Around the edge of [the pentagon or] blade were set 20 whole pearls.\\" (Miner, p. 146) The pledge pin was \\"a black enameled pentagon bearing the Greek letters ΦΩΠ in gold. The pentagon was banded in gold also.\\" (Miner, p. 146) Chapter List The Chapter list: Prior to 1923 these had Hebrew language chapter designations, so the Nebraska chapter would have been Aleph, the Iowa chapter Beth, etc. The chapter designations were recast into Greek form in 1922-23.North Dakota Agricultural College The Weekly Spectrum April 17, 1918 * - Alpha - University of Nebraska (formerly Aleph chapter ) * - Beta - University of Iowa (formerly Beth chapter ) * - Gamma - University of Illinois (formerly Gimel chapter ) * - Delta - University of Kansas (formerly Daleth chapter ) * - Epsilon - University of Washington (formerly Hay chapter ) * - Zeta - North Dakota Agricultural College (formerly Waw chapter ) * - Eta - Iowa State Teachers College (formerly Zayin chapter ) *- Theta - University of Wisconsin (formerly Kheth chapter ) *1917 - Iota - University of Colorado (formerly Teth chapter ) (Inactive 1919) *1917 - Kappa - University of Minnesota (formerly Yodh chapter ) *1919 - California Alpha - University of California (formerly Kaph chapter ) *1920 - Mu - Ohio State University (1933) (revived 1940) *1920 - New York Alpha - New York University from Sigma Phi Beta *1921 - Nu - University of Oklahoma (1929) *1921 - Alpha Epsilon - Montclair Teachers College from ??? *1921 - Lambda (?) - Newark State Normal College (1933) *1922 - New York Gamma - Hunter College *1922 - Xi - Indiana University *1923 - Omicron - Kansas State College *1924 - Pi - Iowa State College (1934) *1924 - Rho - DePauw University (1933) *1924 - Omega - Wittenberg College (1937) *1925 - Sigma - University of California, Los Angeles *1925 - Alpha Alpha - Transylvania University *1926 - Tau - University of Washington *1927 - Psi - Alabama Polytechnic Institute *1928 - Upsilon - Oklahoma A&M; University ( 1932 ) *1929 - Phi - University of Arizona ( 1933 ) *1930 - Alpha Beta - Utah Agricultural College ( 1933 ) *1937 - Alpha Zeta - Georgetown College Additional chapters were formed, including: *____ - ____ - Northwestern University Northwestern's chapter of Phi Omega Pi originated as a local called Aeukiga, which some time after 1928 became a chapter of Sigma Sigma Delta, a non-NPC regional sorority.

In 1946, if it survived, it would have been released to merge with Delta Zeta's chapter on the campus or join one of the other successor national sororities.  References  *Kappa Sigma Fraternity.

She received a Fulbright grant in 1978 to participate in a two-year Fulbright seminar in literary translation held in Rome at the Centro Studi Americani, under the directorship of Frank MacShane of Columbia University and William Weaver, the noted translator from Italian. The project pursued by Lappin in those years, a translation from the Italian of Carmelo Samonà's novel, Brothers, won two prizes in literary translation in the United States: The Renato Poggioli Award in Translation from Italian given by the New York PEN club and a National Endowment for the Arts grant in translation in 1987. She was awarded a second translation grant from the NEA in 1996 for her work on Tuscan writer Federigo Tozzi. From 1987 to the year 2000, she published essays, poems, reviews, and short stories in many US and European publications, including several essays on women writers and artists of the 1920s, including Missing Person in Montparnasse, in the Literary Review, about the life of Jeanne Hébuterne, \\"Jane Heap and her Circle\\" in Prairie Schooner, dealing with the lives of Jane Heap and Margaret Anderson, founders of the Little Review and \\"Dada Queen in the Bad Boys' Club, Baroness Elsa Von Freitag Loringhoven\\" in Southwest Review. Major themes in Lappin's work include women's biographies and autobiographies, expatriate writers in the 1920s, and displacement. Novels In The Etruscan, her first novel, Harriet Sackett, a feminist photographer, travels to Italy to photograph Etruscan tombs for the Theosophical Society. Here she falls in love with a charismatic count, the occultist and amateur archaeologist, Federigo del Re, who materializes and disappears into the Etruscan landscape. As Harriet stalks her phantasm-lover, the solution to the mystery which propels the novel retreats. Is Federigo Del Re faithful; is he a real count, or even a real man; a fantasy or an Etruscan ghost? The novel draws inspiration from the literary gothic novel, Jungian archetypes, fairy tales, and from DH Lawrence's Sketches of Etruscan Places.Rosati, Alessandro, Echi di D.H. Lawrence in \\"The Etruscan\\" di Linda Lappin, tesi di laurea, Università degli Studi dell Tuscia, Viterbo, Italy, 2006, pp. 136 Critically, The Etruscan has been analyzed as a recapitulation of the entire tradition of English/American fiction set in Italy.Prampolini, Gaetano, \\"The Etruscan di Linda Lappin,\\" Oltre il Racconto Venice: Mazzanti editore, pp. 137 -149 A documentary about the book entitled A Tale of Tuscia, directed by Sergio Baldassarre, is available. Lappin's second novel, Katherine's Wish, is a meta-fictional re-elaboration of textual documentation pertaining to the final phase of Katherine Mansfield's life. Written from three points of view, that of Katherine Mansfield, of her companion, Ida Baker, and of her husband, John Middleton Murry, Katherine's Wish recreates a slice of Mansfield's life from 1918 until her retreat to Fontainebleau, to Gurdjieff's Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man in 1922, where she died in 1923. The novel focuses on Mansfield's triangular relationship with Ida Baker and Middleton Murry while tracing her artistic and spiritual quest. Lappin's third novel Signatures in Stone Caravel Books 2013 is set in the Monster Park of Bomarzo, and draws inspiration from the early twentieth century British writer, Mary Butts.

Pirosmanishvili at international auctions and donated them to the Georgian National Museum.Bidzina Ivanishvili donates rare Pirosmani painting to Georgian National Museum Since the day of its foundation, Cartu has provided material assistance to prominent figures active in literature, art, and culture. =Protection of cultural heritage= More than 700 monuments of cultural heritage have been rehabilitated throughout the country. Rehabilitation of cultural and historical monuments is underway on a phased basis in accordance with the plan developed by the Cartu Foundation. The Trinity Cathedral was also built with the money allocated by the foundation.Mutso Renovation project ends this year =Sport= Thirteen training bases and rugby stadiums have been built throughout the country. Various popular sports (judo, wrestling, sambo, taekwondo, boxing, rhythmic gymnastics, chess, water polo, handball, tennis, football, fencing, and shooting) have been financed for many years. The foundation provides material assistance to the Georgian rugby Union and the national rugby team, Georgian Olympic champions, world and European gold medal holders, and veteran athletes. For contributions made to developing rugby, International Rugby Board (IRB) has decided to give Bidzina Ivanishvili an award. In 2015, the foundation was involved in financing preparatory work for the Tbilisi Youth Olympic Festival.IRB Development Award 2014 - Bidzina Ivanishvili =Agriculture= In 1992, Bidzina Ivanishvili donated 400 tractors with full ploughing and sowing equipment to Georgia. In the subsequent years, Cartu implemented a large-scale project aimed at saving local Georgian species. Agricultural enterprises set up for these purposes in the villages of Jigauri and Tsilkani became bases for the restoration of 440 species of Georgian vines and dozens of endemic species of fruit crops. The foundation helped to import from abroad advanced foreign species of vines and tested them in the regions of the country. Adapted species were offered to local farmers. Several standard transplant nurseries were set up with the help of the base in Jigauri. The breeding grounds received seedlings free of charge as well as rootstocks and grafts. About 100 species and populations of annual crops that are kept at the genetic bank were restored. The full system of producing seedlings of elite species of potatoes was put in place. Seedlings were given to farmers free of charge from these bases for many years (for the purpose of organizing transplant nurseries) and hundreds of tonnes of grapes and various fruits and vegetables were supplied to orphanages and homes for elderly people. In 2013-2014, the foundation financed a state program of an unprecedented scale aimed at saving agriculture.Ancient Georgian grape and wheat varieties saved from extinction =Medicine and healthcare= A modern medical center was built in Sachkhere and handed over to the state. Emergency medical care centers were equipped and also handed over to the state in Ureki and the Boriti village of Kharagauli District. The Republican Hospital in Tbilisi was rehabilitated and equipped. The Cartu Foundation has provided free health insurance for more than 50,000 residents of Sachkhere Municipality for many years until universal health insurance was introduced. Hundreds of people received the opportunity to undergo complicated surgeries abroad with the finances allocated by the foundation.Cartu Insurance =Infrastructure= Hundreds of kilometers of roads were covered with asphalt with the material support from the foundation. Infrastructure projects were implemented throughout the country. The infrastructure of Sachkhere Municipality was created. Roofing and repair work was done in 12,652 residential homes. Thousands of residential homes were built and all villages of the municipality were provided with natural gas. The foundation is providing assistance in making the Internet accessible throughout Georgia. The final aim is to make the Internet available to the whole population of the country. The foundation is making a substantial contribution to reforming the Georgian Army and Police and building the necessary infrastructure.Bidzina Ivanishvili to finance rehabilitation of infrastructure, water and gas supply of the village where first President died =Tourism= A dolphinarium was built in Batumi and thematic parks were built in coastal areas, including a miniature park of monuments of Georgian architecture.

According to the plan, a multi-faculty university is being built in Kutaisi, which will host 50,000 students, satisfy high international standards, and be equipped with modern technology. It envisages the construction of a scientific and research center and a hadron collider. The multifunctional center will pursue teaching and educational activities and carry out fundamental and applied scientific research in the following fields: Physics, biology, chemistry, engineering, computer sciences, medicine, and so forth. The scientific and technical center will have ultra-modern laboratories, including a center of crystals, laboratories of biophysics, isotopes, low temperatures, and so forth. The institute will help train a new generation of young scientists and enable Georgian scientists to participate in modern international experiments. The center is also going to have a significant medical potential. It will use hadron therapy to treat patients with serious cancer diseases. The Cartu Foundation has helped to launch the activities of the Mokalake [Citizen] organization aimed at training new generations and strengthening democratic institutions. Thousands of talented school and university students are involved in the projects of the organization. Personal life Ivanishvili owns several estates, including a mansion above Tbilisi which is worth an estimated US$50 million and specially designed for him by Russian architect Mikhail Khazanov and finished by famous Japanese architect Shin Takamatsu.

His father headed the provincial government. Hans first attended school in Gummersbach, from 1907 in Gross-Lichterfelde near Berlin. In August 1914 he joined the German Army as a combat engineer in the Prussian 3rd Pioneer Battalion von Rauch (1st Brandeburgian) in Spandau. He served in France and Galicia; in the latter assignment, he contracted malaria in 1915.http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?f=72&t;=109192&start;=0 He was invalided home to recuperate, returning to duty in December 1915. Aerial service as bomber pilot In February 1916, he applied for transfer to aviation duty. His transfer was granted and he took pilot's training at Schliessheim in May 1916. Upon graduation, he flew bombing raids for FA 19. Some of these raids were among the earliest examples of air attacks upon tanks. He won an Iron Cross Second Class for his service. In 1917, he continued his service as a two-seater pilot, moving on to FA 256, and from there to FA 3.http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/kirschstein.htm Duty as fighter pilot See also Aerial victory standards of World War I He applied for transfer to fighter duty in early 1918. He received fighter training and was assigned to a Prussian squadron, Jagdstaffel 6 on 13 March 1918. He would become this squadron's leading ace.http://www.theaerodrome.com/services/germany/jasta/jasta6.php He scored his first victory on 18 March, flying a Fokker Dr.I in one of the great aerial battles of the war, in which the entirety of Manfred von Richthofen's fighter wing was committed to battle en masse. Kirschstein began by shooting down a Sopwith Camel. He scored twice more in March, on the 27th. He continued to score regularly; on 15 May, he shot down a Sopwith Camel and two Bristol F.2bs for his ninth, tenth, and eleventh triumphs. By the end of May, he was a triple ace, with 15 victories. In early June, Jasta 6 upgraded from Fokker Dr.Is to Fokker D.VIIs.http://www.theaerodrome.com/forum/2001/11817-first- fokker-d-viis-service.html Kirschstein would fly two of the new airplanes, both entirely painted with black and white stripes as an optical illusion to confuse enemy aim. His Fokker Dr.I was handed on to Ernst Udet, who would be Germany's highest scoring ace to survive the war. He would fly them to 12 more victories in June, with his final win being his 27th on 24 June 1918. He would also ascend to command of the Jasta on 10 June. He was awarded the Pour le Merite, Germany's highest award for valor in battle, on 24 June 1918.http://www.pourlemerite.org/ Death by flying accident On 16 July, Kirschstein flew one of his planes in for maintenance at the repair depot at Fismes. He was accompanied by a new pilot in his Jasta, Leutnant Johannes Markgraf, flying formation in a two-seater Hannover CL. After leaving the Fokker, Kirschstein climbed into the rear seat of the Hannover for the return trip. Markgraf, who was unfamiliar with the Hannover, stalled it out at about 50 meters altitude on takeoff. The crash killed both men.

The CM version included an optical system with an integrated scanning telescope and sextant for erecting and correcting the inertial platform. Albert Hopkins received a Ph.D. from Harvard University under Howard Aiken, he then joined the MIT Instrumentation Lab where he was Assistant Director; together with Ramon Alonso, and Hugh Blair-Smith he was a member of the groupBiographies of Apollo Guidance Computer People, Caltech. that designed the computer, designated AGC for Apollo Guidance Computer, identical in the CM and LM. The AGC was a 15-bit plus parity machine with a 1 MHz clock. It was about one cubic foot in volume and weighed about 80 pounds. It used integrated circuit NOR gates, two to a package, but integrated RAM and ROM devices had not been developed yet. It had 2,000 words of magnetic ferrite core read-write memory and maybe 24 thousand words of read-only memory in the form of magnetic core ropes. These cores used metal tape magnetic cores. With such limited computing resources, the software had to be extremely tightly written in assembly code. These computers were designed with extremely long mean times to failure. Fifty were built by Raytheon, and none failed during several years of life. The human interface was a keyboard with ten digit keys and a few auxiliary keys for such things as \\"+\\" and \\"–\\" and \\"enter\\", and a display with three numbers of 5 decimal/octal digits, a two-digit program number, and a two-digit verb and a two-digit noun.

Avinash Wadhawan, Shakti Kapoor, Laxmikant Berde and Dharmesh Tiwari play supporting roles. Plot Rajesh Tripathi (Avinash Wadhawan) lives a poor life in a village in India along with his widowed father, Shivshankar. Rajesh leaves his father so that he can study in Bombay. While there, he becomes a fan of a well-known singer and dancer, Neha (Divya Bharti), for whom he paints hoardings. Neha's show manager Hari Saxena (Shakti Kapoor) approaches Neha, but she refuses his advances and slaps him. Hari then calls another singer to replace Neha and he puts vermilion (sindoor) in laddoos and gives them to Neha. In the middle of the show, Neha's voice becomes rough and the doctor tells her that she can't sing anymore. Meanwhile, Rajesh is caught by the police and is unable to see Neha's performance. He returns to his village and discovers that Neha was there. Later, Neha's car breaks down and Rajesh gives her a lift, but as they are driving his car also breaks down in the middle of a forest. It begins to rain and the pair hide in an old house where some goons attack the two of them. Raju defeats the goons and Neha details the events to the police but the police arrest Raju instead. He is released after one of the goons confess that he was not the instigator. Neha starts a plan and sends Rajesh a love letter for him to accompany her to an isolated shack. She locks him in there, which almost kills him. After this incident, Neha does accept his friendship and confides to him that she can never sing as she has been poisoned by her former manager, Hari. so much so that her vocal cords have been damaged beyond repair. Rajesh accepts the challenge and sets about to resurrect Neha's voice and her career - not knowing that both of them may end up being targets of Hari - who has planned a devious ending for Neha and anyone who supports her.

The family was much involved in the events of its times. Several members of the family served from the 13th century as High Sheriff of the counties of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. Sir John Clifton was slain fighting for the King at the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1402. Sir Gervase Clifton was captured and beheaded following the Battle of Tewkesbury during the Wars of the Roses in 1471. The first Baronet was the grandson of Sir Gervase Clifton (High Sheriff of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire in 1547 and of Nottinghamshire only in 1571) whom he succeeded at the age of only four months in 1588. He was created a Knight of the Bath at the coronation of James I in 1603 and was elevated to baronet in 1611. He served as High Sheriff for Nottinghamshire in 1610 and Deputy Lieutenant 1626–42 and 1660–1666. He was Member of Parliament for Nottinghamshire 1614–1625, 1628–29 and 1661–66, for Nottingham in 1626 and for East Retford 1640–46. He married seven times and was succeeded by the sons and grandsons of three of those wives. The Baronetcy was extinct on the death of the 9th Baronet.

It is managed by the United States Forest Service and is within the Klamath National Forest in Siskiyou County. The land was first set aside in April 1931 as the Marble Mountain Primitive Area, which comprised . It was one of four areas to gain primitive status under the Forest Service's L-20 regulations that year. In 1964, it became a federally designated wilderness area when the U.S. Congress passed the Wilderness Act. The name comes from the distinctive coloration caused by light-colored limestone along with black metamorphic rock on some peaks, giving the mountains a marbled appearance. There are at least five different rock types identified here. The wilderness is in the Klamath Mountains geomorphic province (a large area having similar features such as terrain and geology). The horseshoe-shaped Salmon Mountains are at the core of the wilderness with Marble Mountain being a north-trending spur ridge of the Salmons. The highest point in the Marbles is Boulder Peak at . Flora and fauna This area of high divides, deep canyons and perennial mountain streams provides habitat for a wide variety of plant and animal life. With more than of vertical relief, soils from several rock types, and abundant rain and snowfall, the diversity of ecosystems is unequaled anywhere else in the country. The wilderness contains a number of isolated stands of locally rare conifers. For example, the subalpine fir grows along the granite moraines at the head of watersheds above in open areas surrounding lakes and meadows, in the Sky High Lakes Basin, in Shelly Meadow along the Pacific Crest Trail and in the Deep Lake area. All of the subalpine fir groves in northwest California are more than from the next closest subalpine fir stand, which is in southern Oregon on Mount Ashland. In addition, the headwaters of the Salmon River in the wilderness also hold a relict stand of Pacific silver fir, which is the southernmost stand in the range of the species. Common wildlife include the black-tailed deer and black bear. Less commonly seen species are badger and wolverine. Bird species include the great gray owl and northern goshawk, and also the peregrine falcon and bald eagle, both of which have been removed (August 2007 and August 1999, respectively) from the federal threatened/endangered species list. Fish species include summer steelhead and a spring run of king salmon in Wooley Creek, as well as resident rainbow trout in other streams in the wilderness. There are several rare wildflowers that are adapted to serpentine soils of the Marble Mountain Wilderness and surrounding area. These include crested cinquefoil or crested potentilla (Potentilla cristae), Siskiyou fireweed (Epilobium siskiyouense), and McDonald's rock cress (Arabis blepharophylla var. macdonaldiana), a perennial found in conifer forests of California and Oregon. MacDonald's rockcress is both state-listed (1979) and federally listed (1978) as endangered. Recreation With 89 lakes and two major Wild and Scenic river systems- Wooley Creek and the North Fork Salmon River, as well as of the Pacific Crest Trail, there are many recreation opportunities. Elevations range from ; the wilderness has highly variable terrain with low-elevation canyons and high ridges such as the -long English Peak ridge. Popular activities include fishing, backpacking and cross-country skiing. There are also numerous caves within this wilderness, accessible to prepared spelunkers. They all feature stalactites and other flowstone formations, and are accessible mostly by vertical drops. Due to the hidden nature of most of the cave mouths, caving is not regulated, though the Forest Service and National Speleological Society request only experienced cavers attempt to access these dangerous caves. Signs at the trail heads that access the Marble Rim warn of white nose syndrome. One of the deepest caves in the continental US is located in the wilderness, Bigfoot Cave. There are several national forest campgrounds outside the boundary and one camp inside the wilderness near Wooley Creek, named after Anthony Milne, who was a miner in the area around 1885.

He matriculated to Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in 1967 with the aid of a Lehigh Merit Scholarship and graduated with a BSEE in 1971. He was mentored in his undergraduate years by John J. Karakash, who designed the Electrical Engineering curriculum at Lehigh to liberally educate through engineering. His proclivity for control theory sparked an interest in physiology and then biochemistry, and his undergraduate biochemistry studies led him to physical chemistry. He continued at Lehigh to obtain an MS in chemistry in 1973, an MS in mathematics in 1976, and a Ph.D in chemistry in 1976. He was mentored in graduate education by Jim Sturm, Daniel Zeroka, Albert Zettlemoyer, Fred Fowkes, and Kamil Klier, his thesis advisor. Texter spent a postdoctoral year in biophysical spectroscopy at the University of California at Irvine and a postdoctoral year with Eugene S. Stevens at Binghamton University, developing a time-dependent Hartree–Fock model for circular dichroism in saccharides.  Industrial career  Texter has over 30 years experience in industrial small particle and coating technologies. He worked in the Eastman Kodak Research Laboratories from 1978 to 1998 and he was managing consultant for Strider Research Corporation from 1998 to 2002. From the spring of 2001 he served for a year as a rotator in the National Science Foundation Chemistry Division as Program Director of Experimental Physical Chemistry. While at Eastman Kodak he was a prolific inventor and co-inventor in the field of dispersion technology, and he received 42 issued US Patents and numerous EU and PTO patents.  Academic career  Texter joined the College of Engineering and Technology of Eastern Michigan University in the fall of 2002 as a professor of polymer and coating technology at the rank of full professor. In 2005 he was awarded tenure. Since joining EMU, he also has been a faculty member of the Coatings Research Institute. He spent a sabbatical year near Berlin as a Fellow of the Max Planck Society with Professor Markus Antionetti at the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces. His research has focused on small particle science and technology, the development of particle-based advanced materials, and polymeric advanced materias. His work has focused on applied problems in dispersion and materials technology for advanced coatings in imaging, antifouling, corrosion mitigation, and antimicrobial prophylaxis. He has made significant contributions to the understanding of microemulsion structure and the complex equilibria that exist among the exotic molecular complexes contained in microemulsions, as well as in microemulsion polymerization. Seminal self-diffusion studies done with collaborators at Eastman Kodak produced order parameters that proved transitions among such complex equilibria are continuous phase transitions (chemical equilibria). More recently he has demonstrated thermally initiated microemulsion polymerization in bicontinuous microemulsions, wherein the expansion of the correlation length was only 20% relative to the precursor microemulsion, surpassing competitive attempts by two orders of magnitude. In more recent years, he has become a leading innovator in the fields of stimuli responsive polymers and polymerized ionic liquids. Microemulsion polymerization of ionic liquid surfactant acrylates was used to produce transparent gels that reversibly undergo spinodal decomposition to open cell membranes and monoliths. Related nanolatexes have been formulated that appear to be the first experimental realizations of osmotic spheres.  Service to the public and the profession  Texter served as Chairman of the Division of Colloid and Surface Chemistry of the American Chemical Society in 1998 and in a variety of line officer and executive committee positions before and since (1991–2002), and returned to serve as Program Chair (2008–2010). He has organized many national and international conferences, including chairing the Gordon Research Conferences Chemistry of Interfaces (Interfacial Structure[3]) in Meriden, New Hampshire, in 1996 and Chemistry of Supramolecules and Assemblies (Functional Materials through Bottom-Up Self-Assembly[4]) in Barga, Tuscany in 2007. He has also organized and served as General Chair for the Particles Conferences Particles 2001[2], Particles 2002, through Particles 2013 in Dayton. He is a member of the American Chemical Society, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, the American Physical Society, the Materials Research Society, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and the Society for Imaging Science and Technology.

The screenplay by Isobel Lennart focuses on an aspiring model who leaves her small town in the Midwest to seek fame and fortune in New York City. The film was produced by Voldemar Vetluguin and distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Plot Lily Brannel James (Lana Turner) leaves her small home town in Kansas for New York City, and she is hired by the Thomas Caraway Model Agency. She befriends former top model Mary Ashlon (Ann Dvorak), who becomes her mentor. Mary is depressed about her floundering career and, following a night of excessive drinking, she commits suicide. Lily eventually becomes a very successful model. As a favor to her attorney friend Jim Leversoe (Louis Calhern), she spends some time with Steve Harleigh (Ray Milland), a Montana copper-mine owner in New York on business. The two fall in love, but both realize nothing can come of it. After Steve goes home, he has Jim buy Lily a bracelet, but she refuses to accept it. Lily finds that success does not fill the void in her life. When Steve returns to New York to secure a loan, he runs into her. He tells her he is married. His wife Nora was left a paraplegic in an automobile accident for which he was responsible. Despite this, their feelings for each other are too strong, and they embark on an affair. Matters come to a head when Nora (Margaret Phillips) visits him to celebrate his birthday. On the night of Steve's birthday, Lily hosts a party too, even though Steve stays with Nora, who is making some progress in relearning to walk with crutches. Steve slips out to Lily's party and is taken aback by her self-destructive behavior. Lily decides to confront Nora and asks family friend Jim to accompany her. However, when she sees how nice Nora is and how dependent she is on her husband, Lily cannot bring herself to tell her about her involvement with Steve. On the way out, she bumps into Steve at the elevator and tells him it is over. Some time later, Lily runs into advertising executive Lee Gorrance (Barry Sullivan), who had been dating Mary just prior to her death. When Lily resists his romantic advances, he predicts she will end up lonely and depressed like Mary. Upset by his comments, Lily considers ending her own life, but finally resolves to remain strong, even if she is lonely.

Motion Picture Production Code administrator Joseph Breen rejected the original script as unacceptable, terming it \\"shocking and highly offensive\\" for its portrayal of \\"adultery and commercialized prostitution\\", while a revised version was found to have \\"insufficient compensating moral values\\". In order to bring the story into agreement with the Production Code, screenwriter Isobel Lennart was required to \\"show that the adulterous situation is wrong and that sinners must be punished for their sin\\".A Life of Her Own at Turner Classic Movies Vincente Minnelli originally was assigned to direct the film, but numerous script revisions and problems with casting delayed the start of production by several months, and Minnelli began work on Father of the Bride instead. Lana Turner initially refused to star in the film, but MGM executives Louis B. Mayer and Dore Schary demanded she honor her contract with the studio. Howard Keel, Cary Grant, George Murphy, and James Mason were among those considered for the role of Steve Harleigh, which eventually went to Wendell Corey, who worked on the production through mid- February 1950 but then allegedly asked to be released from the film because he felt he wasn't right for the role. Other sources claimed he was dismissed at the request of Turner and director George Cukor following an argument between the two stars (supposedly Corey, after an inadvertent wardrobe delay by Turner, made a remark that Barbara Stanwyck, whose husband Robert Taylor was reportedly having an affair with Turner, wouldn't have kept everyone waiting; Turner then demanded a casting change). He was replaced by Ray Milland. The film's original ending had Lily leaping to her death, but the studio insisted on a happier finale. Cukor disapproved of the studio's interference and was unhappy with the film as it was released. Music As revealed in the liner notes of the Film Score Monthly release of the music from the film, the main theme for this film would be reused by the composer in the 1952 MGM film Invitation. Critical reception Variety observed, \\"The soap opera plotting has been polished to considerable extent, the playing by the femme cast members is topnotch and the direction aids them, but it is still a true confession type of yarn concerned with a big city romance between a married man and a beautiful model. Script is spotted with feeling and character, and also a lot of conversation that doesn't mean much. A decided asset is Lana Turner's performance.\\"Variety review Awards and nominations Bronisław Kaper was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score but lost to Franz Waxman for Sunset Boulevard. Box office According to MGM's records, the film earned $1,413,000 in the US and Canada and $504,000 elsewhere, resulting in a loss to the studio of $679,000.

In her teens she was brought up at the Swedish royal court as the future queen of King Charles XI of Sweden, her cousin. However, on two separate occasions before the wedding Juliana became pregnant, and the engagement was eventually broken off. In 1679 or 1680, Juliana married a Dutchman and lived the rest of her life in the Netherlands, while Charles married Ulrike Eleonora of Denmark in 1680. Life Juliana was born in Eschwege to Frederick, Landgrave of Hesse-Eschwege (son of Maurice of Hesse- Kassel and his second wife, Juliane of Nassau-Dillenburg), and Eleonora Catherine, a Swedish princess. Her maternal grandmother was Princess Catharina of Sweden, and her mother was a sister of King Charles X of Sweden. Juliana was likely named after her paternal grandmother, a daughter of John VII of Nassau, who was herself likely named after her paternal grandmother, Juliana of Stolberg. Juliana's mother had caused a scandal in Sweden when she confessed to her husband that she had an affair with a French lute-player and actor, Beschon, and was expecting his child. Juliana's father tried to hide the matter but it became a known scandal. It is said that Eleonora was too embarrassed to return to the Swedish court, so she preferred to live in the palace in Eschwege, although she did visit Sweden. Juliana was described as a great beauty. She was taken to the royal Swedish court to be brought up there as the future queen of Sweden by queen dowager Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein- Gottorp, with the prospect of being married to her cousin, King Charles, when he reached adulthood. These plans never came about. In 1672, during a \\"walk by carriage\\" in Stockholm with the queen dowager, Princess Juliana fell to the floor of the carriage in labour. The father of the child proved not to be her cousin the king, but a married officer of the court, Count Gustaf Lillie. The count was exiled, and Juliana was sent to the country, where she was given her own estate and court. The child, a son, was named after his father, Gustaf Gustafsson Lillie, was later raised by Baron Gustaf Adolf von der Osten. His fate is unknown. A couple of years later, Juliana gave birth to another son. This time the father was Johann Jakob Marchand, the young, unmarried son of her Dutch housekeeper. Baptized on 29 November 1656 in Breda, Marchand was the secretary of the Dutch ambassador, and about four years younger than Juliana. In 1679, Juliana's cousin, King Charles, gave her his permission to marry her lover, who was given the title Baron von Lilienburg (Lilie's estate was named Lillienborg). They were married on 22 February 1680 in Raeftnas, Soedermanland and then settled in Haarlem, the Netherlands. Juliana died in 1693 in IJsselstein. Her husband lived ten years more and died on 7 April 1703 in IJsselstein. Her sister, Christine of Hesse-Eschwege, became the Duchess of Brunswick-Lüneburg as the wife of Ferdinand Albert I, Duke of Brunswick- Lüneburg, and was a great-great-great-grandmother of Victoria of the United Kingdom. Children Juliana had the following children.

Ulrika Eleonora Strömfelt (1724-5 April 1780), was a politically active Swedish noble and courtier. She is known for her part in the attempted Coup d'état of queen Louisa Ulrika in 1756. Life Ulrika Strömfelt was the daughter of riksråd count Johan Carl Strömfelt and the överhovmästarinna and royal governess Hedvig Elisabet Wrangel. In 1739, she became hovfröken (maid of honor) to Ulrika Eleonora, Queen of Sweden. In 1744, she was made maid of honor to the new crown princess, Louisa Ulrika of Prussia. She and her sister Agneta Strömfelt belonged to the first circle of courtiers appointed to Louisa Ulrika after her arrival in Sweden together with Cathérine Charlotte De la Gardie, Henrika Juliana von Liewen and Charlotta Sparre. In 1748, she was promoted to the position of kammarfröken (Chief Maid of honor) after Henrika Juliana von Liewen departure from court. She was apparently well liked by Louisa Ulrika, and was often given the task to read to her from French works.Olof Jägerskiöld (1945). Lovisa Ulrika. Stockholm: Wahlström & Widstrand. ISBN =Events of 1756= In 1756, Queen Louisa Ulrika planned a coup d'état to depose the parliamentary system of the Age of liberty with a restoration of an absolute monarchy. To finance the coup, Louisa Ulrika removed the diamonds from the queens' crown, replaced them with crystals, and pawned the diamonds in Berlin in Prussia to finance her coup. Ulrika Strömfelt, however, was a supporter of the Hats (party) and not in favor of a restored absolute monarchy. According to unconfirmed tradition, Ulrika Strömfelt informed the Riksdag that part of the crown jewels was missing and pawned in Germany.Strömfelt, släkt, urn:sbl:34602, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Roger Axelsson), hämtad 2015-02-22. This information led the government to demand an inventory of the crown jewels, which initiated the exposure and failure of the Coup of 1756. A different source claims that it Ulrika Strömfelt informed the foreign office of the Riksdag of the secret correspondence between the Queen and her brother, Frederick the Great.Johan Christopher Barfod: Märkvärdigheter rörande sveriges förhållanden 1788-1794 Either way, this led to the exposure of the coup.

Ulrika Strömfelt has been said to have a \\"peculiar position\\" in the diaries and memoirs of the time, because there are no negative remarks about her personality and character, and she is unanimously described as respectable, sensible and as an ideal of contemporary femininity.

Similar to the cults of Saint Chiaffredo at Crissolo, Saint Bessus at Val Soana, Saint Tegulus at Ivrea, Saint Magnus at Castelmagno, and Saint Dalmatius at Borgo San Dalmazzo, the cult of Saint Constantius was linked with that of the Theban Legion to lend antiquity to a local saint about whom nothing was really known. According to tradition, Constantius survived the decimation of his Legion and fled to the Val Maira, today in the province of Cuneo, with some other survivors. These included Constantine, Dalmatius, Desiderius, Isidore, Magnus, Olympius, Pontius, Theodore, and Victor. They dedicated themselves to preaching the Christian religion, but all of them, except for Constantius, were soon killed by the Roman authorities. Constantius buried his companions. The local geologic formation known as Ciciu del Villar, which are columns formed by natural erosion, was connected with Constantius' legend: the stones are said to be the Roman soldiers sent to kill him, who were miraculously petrified before they could harm the saint. The columns of Ciciu del Villar According to tradition, Constantius was eventually beheaded on Monte San Bernardo, where a sanctuary dedicated to him was built, known as San Costanzo al Monte. This sanctuary probably dates to Lombard times; some eighth century sculptures remain. The sanctuary was rebuilt and altered in succeeding centuries, and the stone church was completed in 1190. A Baroque façade was added later. The Benedictine abbatial church of Santi Vittore e Costanzo, also in Villar, conserves some important archaeological remains, including a marble slab bearing vermilion symbols and worn down by the hands of the faithful. Constantius’ cult became popular, with a pilgrimage to Villar by the faithful taking place every year. Monsignor Tornabuoni, bishop of Saluzzo, declared Chiaffredo patron of his diocese during a synod of 1516, with Constantius as co-patron. Statues of Chiaffredo and Constantius can be found in the altar of the cathedral of Saluzzo. Due to his connection with the Theban Legion, Constantius is considered to have been of Egyptian birth; this has led to his veneration in the Coptic Church.

Built in the 1830s and significantly modified later in the century, it was named a historic site in the 1970s. The Brooks House is a stone building with a brick foundation, an asphalt roof, and additional elements of stone and iron. Its basic plan is a simple rectangle, two stories tall, with an exposed basement. Additional rooms are created by a rear extension that was formed by walling up a large two-story veranda.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1026-1027. The facade is three bays wide, with windows in the central and eastern bays of all three floors; the western bay is occupied by a window (second story) and the main entrance (first story), while the western bay of the basement is blocked by a small staircase. Pilasters with Ionic capitals separate the second-story windows, while no comparable ornament is present below. A shallow hip roof covers the building, pierced by chimneys on either side, while its overhang permits room for a cornice composed of large bracket. The sides are noticeably plainer, with the most prominent element of the western side being a simple fire escape., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2010-02-24. The house's early history is rather enigmatic. It was built for English immigrant Thomas Clegg, a small-scale industrialist who owned Dayton's first iron and brass foundries, although the precise date is uncertain; a stone building was constructed on the present house's site in 1831, and while this may be the present house, it might not have been constructed until the following year. Montgomery County tax records are also inconclusive: they prove that Clegg never owned the property, nor paid taxes on it, but they fail to identify the owner of the property when the house was built. While the original design was clearly Greek Revival in style, renovations in the middle of the nineteenth century included modifications to the cornice and other changes that together produced an appearance typical of the earlier Victorian era. In 1975, the Brooks House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its historically significant architecture. Another building with the same designation, the Dr. Jefferson A. Walters House, lies in the same block of First Street.

His work with startups began in early 2011, when he agreed to work with then-brand new transportation startup Uber to help the company overcome regulatory issues posed by the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) of New York City. Fast Company reported after \\"winning the TLC's blessing in New York City, Tusk moved onto cities including Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Miami, Los Angeles, Denver and Washington D.C.\\" Tusk gained his first exposure to the world of venture capital by taking equity in Uber as part of his fee and gained financial capital to take greater venture risk. In 2015, Tusk ran a high-profile campaign featuring TV, radio and digital ads, direct mail, grassroots outreach, earned media, social media and mobilizing community leaders to oppose New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's proposed plan to cap the number of vehicles Uber could operate. The campaign argued that \\"the company was good for the city, providing jobs and transportation for less affluent residents in the outer boroughs.\\" The bill was dropped before it could go to a vote. Tusk Ventures was launched two weeks after the Uber victory. Tusk Ventures has worked with over three dozen high growth startups including Bird, FanDuel, Lemonade, Handy, Eaze, Nexar, GlamSquad, Ripple, Nurx, Ro, Kodiak Robotics, pymetrics, Grove and Care/Of, solving a variety of political, regulatory and media challenges solely in return for equity in each company and for investment rights in each company's next round of financing.

The New Yorker reported on the mobile voting initiative, describing Tusk's efforts as \\"searching for a way to make it easier for people to vote.\\"  Politics and Government  Tusk began his career in politics as an undergraduate student working for former Mayor of Philadelphia, Ed Rendell, during Rendell's widely documented efforts to save Philadelphia from bankruptcy and decline. After graduating college, Tusk became the spokesperson for the New York City Parks Department and helped run various divisions of the agency, most notably launching a successful campaign to change the way New Yorkers obey the leash law. Tusk later returned to serve as Senior Advisor to New York City Parks Commissioner Henry Stern, Tusk then joined U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer as Communications Director from 2000-2002, handling communications, strategy and policy for the Senator, most notably in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks on New York City. Tusk then joined the administration of New York City's Mayor, Michael Bloomberg, as special advisor to the mayor, where he led the successful effort to re-write the New York City Charter and created the Mayor's campaign promise index, making Bloomberg the nation's first public official to publicly report on the status of every one of his campaign promises. In 2003, Tusk was appointed Deputy Governor of Illinois.

He kept meticulous checklists and spreadsheets on a dozen topics at a time, and sought daily, sometimes hourly, updates from staff members. Over the summer, he ordered staff members to work until 8 every night. They were unhappy, and let him know it. He refused to back down, worried the large staff was becoming complacent.

She was one of the most known socialites of her time and became one of the more known symbols of the Gustavian age. She was the inspiration for several poets; poems by Crusenstolpe, Bellman and Carl Gustaf af Leopold was dedicated to her.  Biography Socialite= Anna Charlotta was born daughter of the wealthy Christoffer Lorentz von Stapelmohr and Maria Lucretia Dittmer: her father was director of the sea customs and was ennobled in 1756. Her parents home was a center for the capital's high society and Charlotta was a celebrated beauty. After her marriage to the noble (since 1759) Elis Schröderheim in 1776, she became the greatest socialite and society hostess of Stockholm. Her husband was then minister and the second most powerful man in the country, and her salon became a center of the aristocracy, where her husbands \\"amiable jokes\\" mingled with the conversation and sharp tongue of his spouse. She is described as passionate, intelligent and wit as a person, beautiful with \\"burning brown eyes\\" to her appearance. She was a member of the order Stora Amaranther-orden (1779), and of the academy Utile Dulci. She was one of only three females known to have been a member of the Utile Dulci, the other being Anna Maria Lenngren and Anna Brita Wendelius.Ann Öhrberg: Fasa för all flärd, konstlan och förställning\\" Den ideala retorn inom 1700-talets nya offentlighet. Samlaren. 2010 The marriage was not a marriage of love, but rather a union of friendship. Several of the friends of the couple were pointed out as her lovers, and she was known for her love affairs, but her husband was tolerant, and the couple lived in harmony. In 1789, the young royal secretary Carl Wilhelm Seele was her lover: Seele was called l'Adonis de la Roture and known for changing clothes three or four times a day to \\"coming, going and riding to demonstrate his beauty\\". Among her lovers were Crusenstolpe and his father. Several of her lovers belonged to the opposition of Gustav III, and her salon became a center of political opposition, where the political acts as well as the personal life of the monarch were exposed to criticism through witty remarks. This disturbed the political career of her spouse, a loyal supporter of the monarch, who demanded of him to close his home to his enemies and tell his wife not to interfere in politics. A conflict arose between Anna Charlotta and the monarch. =Scandal and death= In 1790, Charlotta was pregnant by Seele. In contrast to his usual behavior, Schröderheim demanded a divorce and declared that the child was not his and would be taken from her and registered as dead after the birth. It became a scandal. The reason for the changed behavior of her husband was said to be the king: during a political disagreement, Gustav III, made a remark about her childless marriage and her latest interest in Bruse, one of his stable masters, upon which she answered him: \\"Your Majesty, we can not afford to keep an equerry\\" This remark deeply offended the King, who quite correctly took it as a remark about his and the queen's rumored relationship with the royal stable master, equerry Count Adolf Fredrik Munck af Fulkila: the rumor at the time claimed that the King had asked Munck to impregnate the queen. The sympathies was largely on Anna Charlotta's side during the scandal. She gave birth to a daughter 1 January 1791 and died \\"of sorrow\\" after the childbirth. In 1796, Elsa Fougt gave a memorial speech to her in the order Stora Amaranther-orden: > Court and city admired her exquisite taste, her playful mind. Learning and > the beautiful arts were flattered by her support. Her house became the > center of the best company and the school for good tone, the true > amiability, the decent joy. One gathered around her, to hear her every word; > one admired and praised her wit. Every whim was considered to be better than > what preceded it, and there were those, who thought themselves to be wits, > only by hearing her and repeating what she, even without effort, had babbled > forth. So passed some happy years, by which she, flattered by everyone's > applause and safe by the nature of her own good heart, free from sorrow > abandoned herself to the shining pleasures of the grand world.Lirberg, > Mikaela & Skoglund, Anna-Karin: Ett \\"vittert fruntimmer\\".

In 1744, she was made maid of honor to the new crown princess, Louisa Ulrika of Prussia. She belonged to the first circle of courtiers to Louisa Ulrika after her arrival in Sweden together with Cathérine Charlotte De la Gardie, the sisters Agneta and Ulrika Strömfelt and Charlotta Sparre, and is described as Louisa Ulrika’s first favourite. Louisa Ulrika described her in a letter to her mother: \\"... a girl with many merits and who had the mind of an angel, gay, cheerful and very strong.\\" [...] All my ladies-in-waiting are very beautiful and very funny, each of the can take part in a conversation with no risk of ruining it.\\" Elise M. Dermineur, Gender and Politics in Eighteenth-Century Sweden: Queen Louisa Ulrika She was the confidant of the Louisa Ulrika, and she is believed to have been the informant to expose the first planned Coup d'état of Louisa Ulrika to the ambassadors of Denmark, France and Russia in 1748, a plan which did not have the support of von Liewen.Olof Jägerskiöld (1945). Lovisa Ulrika. Stockholm: Wahlström & Widstrand. ISBN =Later life= In 1748, she married lieutenant colonel baron Carl Hårleman on Drottningholm Palace and retired from court. She was replaced as a favorite of the crown princess by Ulrika Eleonora von Düben. Henrika Juliana von Liewen was a sympathizer of the Hats (party). She is pointed out as the anonymous editor of the political party paper of the Hats party, \\"En ärlig Svensk\\" (\\"An honest Swede\\"), which was published in 1755-56 by Nils von Oelreich. The monarch acted against the paper in the parliament, and H. Benzelius declared it to contradict the bible. It was well known that a great part of the Senate gathered in the salon of von Liewen to proof read the paper. Her political activism made her the target of slander: the caps politician Johan Arckenholtz accused her of having had an affair with William VIII, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel during his visit in Sweden in 1732 and of having had a child with the Hessian president Dörnberg.Liewen (von), Liwen, Lyue, släkt, urn:sbl:11365, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av H G-m), hämtad 2015-02-20. In 1755, she was granted a pension by the parliament, at the time dominated by the Hats party. After the victory of the Caps party in 1765, she almost lost the pension. However, after the death of her spouse, she had made a donation of his library about architecture, his drawings and printings, to the royal library of Stockholm, and as this exceeded the value of her pension, she was allowed to keep it.Liewen (von), Liwen, Lyue, släkt, urn:sbl:11365, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av H G-m), hämtad 2015-02-20.

These revolvers were marketed to law enforcement duty issue, military, and civilian self-defense markets. Development and history As far back as 1966, Ruger designers Harry Sefried and Henry Into began working on the company's first double-action revolver. Despite being popular with civilians, Bill Ruger wanted to get into law enforcement and security contracts. Smith & Wesson and Colt at the time dominated the medium frame law enforcement double action revolver contracts.https://www.shootingillustrated.com/articles/2017/8/3/classics- ruger-security-six-revolver/ The introduction of the Security-Six and its variants marked Sturm Ruger's first attempt to enter the double-action revolver market. The corporation's earlier designs had been Colt Peacemaker- style single-action revolvers. Ruger used investment casting for most parts in an effort to hold down production costs.Tong, David. “Ruger Security-Six .357 Magnum Revolver” Chuck Hawks Web site. Accessed December 14, 2008. As with all Ruger firearms, the Security-Six revolvers were robustly designed with large, heavy-duty parts for durability and to allow for investment casting.Crumpston, Mike. \\"Revisiting Ruger's Revolvers\\" BNET Web site. Accessed December 14, 2008. Sefried had previously worked for High Standard Manufacturing Company, where he designed the High Standard Sentinel revolver. The grip profile of the Sentinel was used on the \\"Six\\" line. Ruger's new double action revolvers were unlike other guns on the market in that they used a one-piece frame, rather than a removable sideplate, which lent them superior strength. The Ruger Redhawk, introduced in 1980 and also designed by Sefried, was a scaled-up and improved version of the Security-Six. The \\"six series\\" line enjoyed sales success because of their basic features, solid construction, and competitive pricing. Various models were issued by US government agencies as diverse as the former Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Postal Service, the Border Patrol, and numerous police agencies. The Security-Six and its derivatives also became the standard issue service weapons of a large number of police departments, in addition many were exported overseas. While Ruger's Security-Six line has been out of production since 1988, a total of over 1.5 million revolvers were produced and they remain well-liked and respected, as well as highly sought after in the second-hand market. By the early 1980s, it was determined that the Ruger Six line guns were wearing out faster than expected from users that practiced frequently with .357 Magnum ammunition. Ruger commissioned a heavier duty upgrade of the Six line that could handle a \\"lifetime diet\\" of full-powered magnum loads. Ruger's answer to this problem was the GP100, which featured a beefier frame and barrel, stronger steels, a redesigned grip frame and, most notably, a triple-locking cylinder to give extra strength to the action. The GP100 quickly replaced the Security-Six in the Ruger product line, but the Six line is still popular with shooters and collectors today. Features The Security-Six and its variants were more or less identical in basic design, with minor differences in sights (fixed or adjustable) and frame (round or square butt). Although medium-framed in size, the Security-Six was somewhat stronger than competing guns like the Smith & Wesson Model 19 as the Ruger featured a thicker frame without a sideplate cutout, a stronger barrel shank support that prevented catastrophic barrel failure in the six inch model revolvers, larger, stronger internal parts, and an increased diameter cylinder with offset bolt locking notches. The new revolvers were initially manufactured in a blued carbon steel finish; in 1975 stainless steel versions of all models were added to the lineup. Featuring six-round cylinders, the Security-Six series represented one of the first modern revolver designs to feature a hammer powered by a coil spring utilizing a transfer-bar firing system, and was chambered for a variety of centerfire ammunition cartridges including .38 Special and .357 Magnum, as well as .38 S&W; and 9×19mm Parabellum (9mm Luger). All Security-Six series revolvers came with original equipment manufacturer (OEM) supplied service-style wooden grips. The wood grips were all manufactured for Ruger by W.F. Lett Manufacturing in New Hampshire, a now-defunct contractor. Most of these wood grips featured a diamond-shaped panel of pressed checkering, though smooth walnut grips with uncheckered panels were shipped with some commemorative models. Oversized walnut target/combat grips were also available as a factory option. During the 1980s, some of the Speed- and Service-Six models were also shipped with rubber Pachmayr grips containing the silver Ruger emblem. Another feature of the Security-Six was straightforward disassembly, which required no tools with the exception of a flathead screwdriver, coin, or cartridge case rim used to remove the grip screw. Disassembly of the Security-Six is as follows: 1: Make sure the firearm is unloaded. 2: Turn out grip screw. 3: Remove Grips. 4: Compress main spring. 5: Insert pin and decompress main spring. 6: Remove main spring. 7: Remove hammer pin. 8: Remove hammer. 9: Release and remove trigger assembly. 10: Release and remove Cylinder. =Security-Six= Ruger Security Six with a 2.75\\" barrel (70 mm) and rubber grips. Introduced in 1972, the Security-Six was the original model of the new series. The majority of these guns were manufactured with adjustable sights, though a few early models were sold with fixed sights. Security-Sixes could be ordered with either service or \\"target\\" (combat) -style square butt grips. Nearly all Security-Sixes were chambered for the .357 Magnum cartridge, which also permitted the use of the shorter .38 Special cartridge. Ruger also chambered the Security-Six in .38 Special for some police orders by fitting different cylinders that could only accommodate the .38 Special cartridge. Barrel lengths available on the Security-Six included 2.75, 4, and 6 inches. The .357 Magnum, four inch barreled model was standard issue to uniformed officers of the former U.S. Immigration and Naturalization ServiceFormer I&NS; Special Agent as well as Patrol Agents of the U.S. Border Patrol until both agencies adopted .40 caliber semi-automatic pistols.Former Border Patrol Agent =Service-Six= After a few months of production, Ruger renamed the fixed- sight version of the Security-Six the Service-Six or alternatively, the \\"Police Service-Six\\". This was largely a marketing decision and an attempt to capitalize on the lucrative law enforcement service revolver market. The Service-Six was normally chambered in .357 Magnum, though Ruger also built versions in .38 Special and 9mm Luger (Parabellum) for some police orders. The U.S. Military contracted for the fixed-sight .38 Special variant adding a lanyard ring to the butt and designating it the M108. It was to replace aging Smith & Wesson Model 10 for issuing to air crews and military police. The 9mm variant featured cylinder chambers bored to headspace the cartridge on the case mouth instead of the rim, using a patented spring moon clip to permit extraction of the fired case. These alterations allowed the rimless 9mm cartridge to be used in a revolver design. Barrel length options for the Service-Six included 2.75 and 4 inches. The 9mm was also marketed under the designation M109. =Speed-Six= Rare Speed-Six variant in 9mm Parabellum, which uses moon clips to chamber the rimless cartridges Incorporating fixed sights and a round-butt frame, and available in .357 Magnum, .38 Special, .38 S&W; (.38-200), and 9mm Luger, the Speed-Six was intended for use by plainclothes detectives and others desiring a more concealable handgun. The standard barrel lengths available for these models were the same as those for the Service-Six, but also included a 3-inch length in certain law-enforcement contract orders, such as for the U.S. Postal Service (Model GS33-PS). The .357 Magnum, three-inch barreled model was standard issue to Special Agents of the former U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service as well as Patrol Agents of the U.S. Border Patrol working plain clothes assignments until both agencies adopted .40 caliber semi-automatic pistols. The .38 S&W; variant (in England known as the .380 British or .38-200) was equipped with a military-style lanyard ring, and was sold to law enforcement organizations in India. The .357 Magnum version was standard issue for the Royal Ulster Constabulary, who, unlike most police officers in the United Kingdom, were routinely armed.

A ship mill is a type of watermill. The milling and grinding technology and the drive (waterwheel) are built on a floating platform on this type of mill. \\"Deutsches Museum: Ship Mill\\", The Deutsches Museum's collections: Ship Mill (Model), 1819 (see below: External links). Its first recorded use dates back to mid-6th century AD Italy. Technology Between barge and boat well is the undershot water wheel, which is driven by the flowing water of the current. There is also evidence of water mills for which both sides had a narrower water wheel, similar to an old paddle steamer. The floating platform is anchored at the most intense point in the current, to the bridge piers for easy access to the mill, or to the shore. Floating allows the mill to operate with the same power despite changing water levels. The efficiency of the mill can at best match a standard undershot mill. Ship mills could potentially run full-time, good for tasks that demanded constant power. Ship mills could be drawn when needed (due to shipping, rafting, ice) to shore. In central Europe ship mills were, as most water and wind mills, owned by lords or monasteries. Ship mills in Central Europe have not remained; after the advent of riverboat traffic, they became a hindrance. Ship mills last about fifty years. File:Schiffmuehle01.jpgA ship mill (drawing 1 after H.Ernst, 1805). File:Schiffmuehle02.jpgA ship mill (drawing 2 after H.Ernst, 1805). History In the 537 siege of Rome, supplies were interrupted by the Goths from providing the population with vital flour from the surrounding water mills. Also, the aqueducts that supplied Rome with water and some cities which had water-driven mills could no longer work. The solution devised by the Eastern Roman general Belisarius was the \\"reverse principle of a water mill\\" - the ship mills, which were anchored on the Tiber river around Rome. It was a type of watermill powered by water wheels mounted on the sides of vessels moored in midstream, preferably close to bridges where the current is stronger. From then on, the ship mill spread to Europe, reaching Paris (556) Geneva (563) and Dijon (c. 575). Ship mills were developed in the Islamic world some time between the 8th and 10th centuries. They were employed along the Tigris at Mosul in 10th-century Iraq, where large ship mills made of wood and iron could produce 10 tons of flour from corn every day for the granary in Baghdad. In 1184, Ibn Jubayr described ship mills in the same region on the Khabur River. From the lack of records, it appears that they did not spread further to Iran. From the late 10th century onwards, there was an expansion of milling in Northern Europe. Since then, ship mills remained a common sight in much of Europe until the 19th century, with a few of them surviving up to our time. The German terms \\"Schiffsmühle\\" or \\"Schiffmühle\\" are used according to local language preferences. Geographical spread of ship mills German ship mills on the Rhine at Cologne, around 1411.

Civil works for the construction began in October 2004. It was initially planned that the reactor would begin nuclear operations in 2014. History Heavy Water Production Plant near Arak Iran's leadership decided to construct a natural uranium nuclear power plant, using heavy water as moderator and coolant, in the mid-1980s. The reactor design was 90% complete in 2002. By then the existing Tehran Research Reactor, after 35 years operation, was reaching its design safety limits, and had been enveloped by the suburbs of Tehran. The reactor was originally going to be constructed at a location in Esfahan, but in 2002 it was decided to build instead at the current location near Arak.Alexander (146) In August 2006, mixed reports came out about when the reactor would go into operation, one stating that the plant would start up in 2009, while another reported that operation would be postponed until 2011.Alexander (147) Reportedly, the Russian firm Nikiet assisted with portions of the design, but stopped in the late 1990s following U.S. pressure. Press reports indicate that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited the reactor in June 2013, on the occasion of the reactor vessel installation which is the final precursor prior to commencement of operation. Current Status Under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Iran agreed to redesign the IR-40 reactor, with assistance from the P5+1, to minimize its plutonium production and avoid production of weapons-grade plutonium. Iran also agreed to remove the reactor core or calandria and fill it with concrete to render it unusable, and to export all spent fuel within one year of its removal from the reactor.The Plutonium Pathway: Arak Heavy Water Reactor and Reprocessing, Institute for Science and International Security, July 21, 2015. On 14 January 2016, Iran stated that the core of the reactor had been removed and that it would be filled up with concrete.https://www.rt.com/news/328911-iran-arak- reactor-core RT (TV network) Role in Iran's nuclear program Iran states that the reactor will only be used for research and development, medical and industrial isotope production. On June 16, 2010 Iran announced plans to fabricate fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor by September 2011 and to build a new 20 MW reactor for radioisotope production within five years.http://www.ajc.com/news/nation-world/iran-plans-more- powerful-549480.html https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iQhYOH0V3xqCh-VJFxkigLrF- WgA Aspects of IR-40's design will also serve as a prototype and testbed for the larger 336 megawatt Darkhovin Nuclear Power Plant under construction near Ahvaz. =Proliferation concerns= There are some proliferation concerns about the reactor's ability to produce enough plutonium for several nuclear weapons each year. However the IAEA has reported that it found no indication of ongoing reprocessing activities, required to extract plutonium from the spent fuel.GOV/2008/38, September 15, 2008, Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement and relevant provisions of Security Council resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007) and 1803 (2008) in the Islamic Republic of Iran In full operation, it is expected that the reactor will produce from to of plutonium a year within its spent nuclear fuel. Natural-uranium fueled heavy- water reactors were originally designed for producing weapons-grade plutonium usable for construction of nuclear weapons. Analysis suggests that Iran could extract 8–10 kilograms of high purity Pu-239Weapons-grade plutonium is at least 93% Pu-239. annually from fuel irradiated in IR-40. This, according to the IAEA, is sufficient weapons-grade material to produce 1 to 2 nuclear weapons annually. In August 2009 the IAEA was granted access to IR-40 and was able to carry out Design Information Verification, where the IAEA confirmed that the facility \\"at its current stage of construction conforms to the design information provided by Iran as of January 24, 2007.\\" , August 28, 2009, Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement and the Relevant Security Council Resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007), 1803 (2008) and 1835 (2008) in the Islamic Republic of Iran As a result of concerns that this plutonium would support weapons development, former IAEA Deputy Director-General for Safeguards, Olli Heinonen, proposed a reactor redesign to a reactor using slightly enriched uranium fuel rather than natural uranium. Use of enriched uranium fuel combined with extended operations would reduce the reactor's ability to produce weapons-grade plutonium. Iran has indicated they do not intend to reprocess IR-40 spent fuel to recover weapons-grade plutonium, nor operate under a low burnup regime that could produce weapons-grade plutonium. Originally a hot cell facility at the Arak site was planned, described as capable of handling irradiated fuel and targets (such as targets for production of medical radioisotopes) from the IR-40, but in 2004 plans for hot cells at Arak were removed. However some proliferation experts have expressed concern that once sufficient fuel has been irradiated Iran may modify this facility or build a separate reprocessing facility to recover weapons-grade plutonium.

His research focused on civil rights and American political parties. Early life and education Cotter was born in New York City to family involved in local politics. (His parents were reform Democrats; Cotter would later join the Republican Party.) He did not finish high school, but worked on the docks during World War II. After an injury, he spent a year in the hospital before enlisting in the Navy in 1943. Cotter served in the Marshall Islands, assigned to managing records of military trials. Taking advantage of the G.I. Bill, Cotter received an A.B. degree from Stanford University in 1949. He went on to earn a Masters of Public Administration (1951) and Ph.D. (1953) in Public Administration from Harvard University. While he attended school, he supported himself and his family as the business manager of a New Jersey summer theater company. He completed further studies at the London School of Economics as a Sheldon Traveling Fellow in 1951-1952. CareerAcademia= In 1952-1953, Cotter taught as an instructor at Columbia University. In 1953, he joined the faculty of Stanford University, where he became an associate professor in 1956. In 1963, he joined the faculty of Wichita State University as a department chair. He moved to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee in 1967, where he was department chair from 1969-1972 and associate dean for graduate research from 1973-1975. He retired in 1989. He conducted research about American political parties and institutional change, including work (with John F. Bibby) on a National Science Foundation grant, \\"Party Transformation in the United States and the Institutional Party\\" (1978-1981). The research from this grant was written up in many articles and in a book, Party Organizations in American Politics (1984). In 1968, he published Jet Tanker Crash: Urban Response to Military Disaster, about the 1965 USAF KC-135 Wichita crash, which he witnessed. He followed up on the disaster by documenting the accident report and ensuing lawsuits. =Political work= Cotter is noted as the executive director of the Republican Committee on Program and Progress. The committee was established in 1959 by Meade Alcorn, then the Republican National Chairman. President Dwight D. Eisenhower and other party leaders were concerned that the GOP would be defeated at the polls in 1958 unless they could articulate their policy positions. The committee, which consisted of 44 Republicans from various backgrounds, was chaired by Charles H. Percy, president of Bell and Howell. Cotter was named a Republican National Committee Faculty Fellow in 1959. In 1960, he was also an assistant to Meade Alcorn, then the chairman of the Republican National Committee, and his successor, Senator Thruston Ballard Morton. President Eisenhower appointed Cotter to the staff of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission in 1960. He worked with the commission on research and hearings, particularly in the South, until 1963. He continued to work with the Civil Rights Commission after moving to Wisconsin, serving on the state advisory committee. Personal life Cotter married to Beverly Blair Cook in 1966. She was also a notable professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. They raised 8 children and step-children. He died in 1999 after sustaining injuries in a car crash.

Due to the security situation in Baidoa, it was held in Djibouti. President Sharif Sheikh Ahmed won in a run-off election.  Background  The election was necessitated following the resignation of President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed on 29 December 2008, over the dismissal of the government of Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein which was not approved by the Transitional Federal Parliament. As such, the Speaker of Parliament Adan Mohamed Nuur Madobe shall act as interim President until the Parliament elects a new President based on the Transitional Federal Charter within 30 days. Postponing the election until a new interim parliament, which would likely include moderate Islamist opposition, was considered, but Interim President Aden Madobe stated that a new president would be selected within the constitutionally mandated 30-day period. On 11 January 2009 African Union Peace and Security Commissioner Ramtane Lamamra announced that the election would take place on 26 January, with preparations including nominations of candidates commencing on 20 January. Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein announced on 15 January 2009 that he would like to become president. Other official candidates include MP Mohamed Afrah Qanyare (an ex-Mogadishu warlord), MP Hassan Abshir Farah (a former prime minister), Ali Mohammed Ghedi (also a former prime minister), Ali Khalif Galaid (another former prime minister) and Mohammed Said Hersi Morgan (an ex-Kismayo warlord); ARS Chairman Sharif Ahmed also stated he was a contender for the presidency. In total, at least sixteen candidates have stated they want to become President; the PM and the ARS chairman are seen as the most likely contenders. Due to difficulties in picking the next president, the deadline was considered to be extended; despite strong pressure from the international community, the original deadline of 28 January 2009 was extended by five days, meaning the election is to be held by 2 February 2009. As planned, the Transitional Federal Parliament was enlarged to include 200 representatives from the Islamist opposition and 75 representatives of citizens' groups and diaspora representatives; the former group was sworn in on 27 January 2009. The 275 existing MPs voted 211 to 6 in favour with 3 abstentions to enlarging the TFP.  Candidates  A total of fourteen candidates formally filed to stand in the election. The candidates were: * Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, leader of the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia * Mohamed Osman Aden, counselor at the Somali embassy in Nairobi, Kenya * Mohamed Qanyare Afrah - Former faction leader, and Minister for Internal Security. * Mohamed Ahmed Ali, a young candidate from the Somali diaspora in the United States. * Awad Ahmed Asharo, MP * Yusuf Azhari, an advisor to former president Yusuf * Ali Hashi Dhoore, a Somali businessman based in Italy * Hassan Abshir Farah, former mayor of Mogadishu and PM from 2001 to 2003 * Mohamoud Mohamed Gacmodhere, MP and former minister, was appointed PM by then- President Ahmed Yusuf late in 2008 before resigning a few days later * Ali Khalif Galaid, PM from 2000-2001, university professor * Abdirahman Abdi Hussein, former general and envoy to Iran * Nur Hassan Hussein * Ahmed Hashi Mahmoud, former army officer. * Maslah Mohammed Siad Barre, a general and son of former president of Somalia Mohamed Siad Barre * Musa Mualim Yusuf, a businessman based in Uganda, has never lived in Somalia  Results  There were three rounds of voting. There would have been less if one candidate garnered more than two thirds of the vote in an earlier round. The first round of voting reduced the field of candidates to six, the second to just two, with the winner decided in a run-off round. As the first round of voting began, several candidates withdrew, increasing the speculation that the vote would largely be a choice between Nur Hassan Hussein and Sharif Sheikh Ahmed. In the first round, Sharif Sheikh Ahmed got 215 votes, Maslah Mohamed Siad 60 and Nur Hassan Hussein 59; Nur Hassan Hussein then withdrew his candidacy, thus likely sealing the election of Sharif Sheikh Ahmed as president. Reportedly, Ali Khalif Galaid also withdrew. All candidates except Maslah Mohamed Siad withdrew after the first round of voting; Sharif Sheikh Ahmed won the run-off with 293 to 126 votes.

HistoryMigration to Slovakia= Roma children in Eastern Slovakia A Roma settlement in the region of Šariš The Roma minority in Slovakia (census 2001) The first record of sightings of small groups of Romani within the area of present-day Slovakia are from 1322 AD, when the region was part of the Kingdom of Hungary. Major waves of Romani nomads were recorded from 1417 onwards. In 1423 they received a decree from the Hungarian king Sigismund of Luxemburg at Szepes Castle, granting them Europe-wide right of passage and the right to settle. They proved to be useful metal workers for the royal armies fighting the Turks. Through the ensuing centuries, whilst in western and central Europe Romani were treated violently and often expelled, the Hungarian Kingdom and Habsburg Monarchy in general provided a tolerant and stable safe-haven for the Romani community. In the 18th century, Joseph II of the house of Habsburg attempted to 'civilize' the Romani, for example by prohibiting their dress and customs and educating them. However these efforts generally failed. =20th century= After the repressive Romani policies of the first Czechoslovak Republic (1918-1939), the communist government of 1945-1989 attempted to integrate the Romani into the majority population through obligatory education and employment, and the formation of Romani organizations. The nomadic way of life was banned in 1958. Parts of the Romani population were also transferred from Slovakia into the country's Czech regions. Though these policies were partly successful, after the 1989 Velvet Revolution, the Romani have once again found themselves on the margins of the society. On the one hand, there is a generous social system, but the system fails to effectively integrate them into the mainstream society. Discrimination in education Roma people suffer serious discrimination in Slovakia. Roma children are segregated in school and do not receive the level of education as other Slovakian children. Some are sent to schools for children with mild mental disabilities. As a result, their attainment level is far below average. Amnesty International’s report \\"Unfulfilled promises: Failing to end segregation of Roma pupils in Slovakia\\" describes the failure of the Slovak authorities to end the discrimination of Roma children on the grounds of their ethnicity in education. According to a 2012 United Nations Development Programme survey, around 43 per cent of Roma in mainstream schools attended ethnically segregated classes. Forced sterilisation A human rights fact finding mission found widespread violations of Romani women’s human rights including forced sterilisations, racially discriminatory access to health care and physical and verbal abuse by medical staff amongst others. The report states that there was a \\"clear and consistent patterns of health-care providers who disregarded the need for obtaining informed consent to sterilization and who failed to provide accurate and comprehensive reproductive health information to Romani patients.\\" Crime Panel house (alt= Roma are the victims of ethnically driven violence and crime in Slovakia. According to monitoring and reports provided by the European Roma Rights Center (ERRC) in 2013, racist violence, evictions, threats, and more subtle forms of discrimination have increased over the past two years in Slovakia. The ERRC considers the situation in Slovakia to be one of the worst in Europe, as of 2013. Social help Romani people receive new housing from municipalities and regional administrations for free every year, however people complain that some of them end up being destroyed by Romani people themselves. After the destruction, in some cases it has happened that the residents receive new housing, without being criminally prosecuted for destroying state property.

She was known as Donner Mum, Madam Donner, and \\"Madam Herr Donner\\" (Mr Madame Donner). Life Born in Visby, Sweden to merchants Mathias Lythberg and Johanna Wihadi, she was given a good education, and was active as her father's business assistant. In 1744, she married the German merchant Jürgen Hinrich Donner from Lübeck. They settled in Visby on Gotland in 1746, and had four children. They bought a building in Visby where they founded an empire of import and export with Germany and Great Britain. The building is now known as ”The Donner House”, and the square by which the building is located was to be known as: ”Donner's place”. Margaretha was the company's accountant. When she became a widow in 1751, she took sole control over the business as director. She made herself responsible for the export, and created a merchant fleet with twenty ships. She also founded a factory on Gotland. She was appreciated by her employees, and called ”Donner Mum” by some, and ”Madam Donner” by others: some of her German business- partners could not imagine a woman as head of such a big business empire, and by them she was sometimes called \\"Madam Herr Donner\\" (Mr Madame Donner). She helped her two sons to start their own business, but she did not allow them any influence in her own affairs, and she did not acquaint them with the main business until after she acquired tuberculosis, of which she died at Visby in 1774. The Donner empire expanded under her sons, both of whom included their wives in their work. The business eventually went bankrupt in 1845.

It is practiced as a means of getting further out to sea in order to increase the chances of catching a fish and can be dangerous. The term skishing is a portmanteau of water-skiing and fishing because when hooked the stripers pull the angler through the water.\\"Skishing; Extreme bass fishing, in which anglers don wetsuits and flippers and, with a rod tucked under and arm, swim a couple of hundred yards offshore, typically on moonlit nights, to cast live eels while drifting with the current.

I would hesitate to recommend it to anyone who is not at least a little crazy. But for me, skishing is to surfcasting, as a hurricane is to a windy day. To be immersed in the element that holds your quarry, bass sometimes swimming so close to you that you can kick them, feeling the raw power of a big bass pull you around, wrestling one on one with a big fish in their element is unreal. They don't give up when they're still in the water, and you can't lift a big bass out of the water when you're swimming, so it can become a friggen wrestling match until you get your hook out if the fish is still green. I always crush the barbs of my hooks for an easier release anyway, so sometimes you can just give them some slack and they'll release themselves if it's just a lip hook. With an 11' rod, you really have a lot more leverage than most would think, and with some practice you can horse a fish in (or pull yourself closer to it) rather quickly. Skishing also provides the surfcaster with access to many very fishy areas that are not accessible from shore or frequented by boats due to the hazardous rocks and reefs. How many times have you been standing on a rock or on the beach and the fish are busting beyond your casting range? That's frustrating. Skishing lets you get out to where they are.\\" SKISHING description by Paul Melnyk - Montauk, N.Y.: \\"It was an extraordinary feeling for me to be floating weightless in this dynamic sea, and I felt as thought I had shed every pound of excess baggage as I rode the tide . . . Fighting a substantial fish while swimming is a unique experience. A balance must be achieved between the hunter and the prey. Any variation to this equilibrium causes a loss of control as the fish pulls. I was kicking hard to keep myself upright, fighting the fish while using my whole body as leverage. . .

Being on general Rochambeau's staff for the duration of the war, Chastellux acted as the principal liaison officer between the French commander in chief and George Washington. However the Chevalier de Chastellux was also widely recognized, at the time of his campaigns in America, as a highly talented man of letters and a member of the Académie française Early literary career He first became known as a writer, historian and philosopher. He was the third member elected to occupy Seat 2 of the Académie française in 1775. Military career in America After arriving in America in July 1780, Chastellux participated to the American Revolutionary War as Major General in the French expeditionary force led by general Rochambeau. During the following year, he was third in command of the French forces engaged at the decisive Siege of Yorktown in 1781 where the British were ultimately defeated. Major General de Chastellux was fluent in English and with his strong ideological support of the American cause, he served the alliance well. During the latter part of the campaign he was the principal liaison officer between George Washington and French general Rochambeau. Thereafter, Chastellux remained a personal friend of George Washington for life. Furthermore, the College of William and Mary and the University of Pennsylvania also awarded Chastellux with honorary degrees. After his return to France, Chastellux also remained in contact with Thomas Jefferson, now the American representative in Paris, whom he had previously visited on his Virginia estate at Monticello. He was elected both a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and of the American Philosophical Society in 1781 (the latter honorary membership in the same year was bestowed upon Lafayette and François Barbé-Marbois, both of whom were fellow friends to the American Revolutionary cause). His late literary career Major General de Chastellux placed on record and published in 1786 his complete recollections of the American War of Independence. This included a description of his travels in America after the war had ended. Chastellux described George Washington as an effective yet profoundly human leader in wartime.

During her lifetime, she became an ideal and role model for a learned female scholar.  Biography  Vendela Skytte was born to statesman and noble Johan Skytte and Maria Näf and became the aunt of Gustav Skytte, Maria Skytte and Christina Anna Skytte. Growing up in an environment where humanists such as Thomas More, Erasmus of Rotterdam and Juan Luis Vives were popular, she was given the same education as her brothers by her father – her sister Anna Skytte also became respected for her learning. She studied theology, ethics, history, philology and geology, and mastered Latin, French, German and Greek. This was unusual, as the educational level was not normally this high for females of the nobility. She corresponded in Latin, and became known for her poetry. Vendela Skytte was famed in her lifetime for her learning and academic abilities, qualities which were then regarded as rare for her sex, and came to be regardedSkytte, släkt, https://sok.riksarkivet.se/sbl/artikel/6030, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Mattias Andersson), hämtad 2016-11-04. as the ideal of a female academic. She was praised for keeping her femininity despite her learning, two things regarded as contradictory by her contemporaries. She has been called the most learned female of her country before Christina of Sweden. She held a salon and participated in the contemporary intellectual debate. She surrounded herself with scientists and artists and corresponded with the learned Catharina Burea.Vendela Skytte i Wilhelmina Stålberg, Anteckningar om svenska qvinnor (1864) Aside from her learning, she was admired for her beauty and wit.

She became the target for pilgrimages when claiming to be the channel of the words of the angels. Life Margareta was born to Johannes Laurentii, the Vicar of Kumla since 1619. In 1626, Margareta, by then in her teens, claimed to have a vision of a white bird and a black man. The black man tried to convince her to abandon her beliefs. At the same time, the vicarage and the church of Kumla experienced the phenomena of poltergeist.Göte Göransson: Gustav II Adolf och hans folk (Gustav II Adolf and his people) Stockholm (1994) . On 30 October 1626 Margareta uttered blasphemy and called upon Satan. Afterward, she claimed to have had a visit from seven high ranked devils. On 22 October she claimed to have been visited by three angels with burning candles, among them the Archangel Michael. After this, she was unconscious for 24 hours. When she awakened, she claimed that angels and devils had fought for her soul and that she had seen the \\"Glory of the Lord\\".Göte Göransson: Gustav II Adolf och hans folk (Gustav II Adolf and his people) Stockholm (1994) . Between 9 December 1626 and 3 January 1627, she claimed to have been visited by a litany of angels. She stated that she had now become the channel of the angels, and that what she henceforth said was their words through her.Göte Göransson: Gustav II Adolf och hans folk (Gustav II Adolf and his people) Stockholm (1994) . Margareta now foretold that the war would be discontinued by a miracle in Poland. She had visions about the Sun and the stars. She also issued instructions about clothing: she condemned the use of farthingales, Ruff (clothing) for vicars, a number of different colors, and promoted white starch before blue by referring to the views of God: in the question of starch, for example, she explained that blue starch was the vomit of Satan, while white was pleasing to the Lord.Göte Göransson: Gustav II Adolf och hans folk (Gustav II Adolf and his people) Stockholm (1994) . The visions of Margareta made her famous nationwide. She was called the prophetess of Kumla, and attracted pilgrimages from the entire country to the vicarage of Kumla, among them also clergy. In the vicarage, the pilgrims allegedly witnessed blankets burning with fire and could here shouts and choirs from heaven, all affected by the poltergeist and visions of Margareta. One noted incident was when Margareta allegedly performed a miracle when she reportedly cured a boy from deafness, claiming that it was the angel Gabriel who cured the boy through her.Göte Göransson: Gustav II Adolf och hans folk (Gustav II Adolf and his people) Stockholm (1994) . Finally, Margareta stated that the angels had promised to dictate a letter through her, which was to be delivered to the King by her father.Göte Göransson: Gustav II Adolf och hans folk (Gustav II Adolf and his people) Stockholm (1994) . On this point, Bishop Laurentius Paulinus Gothus was given the task to make an investigation. The main object of Margareta's activities from the authorities was not her revelations or her messages, as the subjects of her preaching was actually uncontroversial and in effect acceptable to the church: the problem was the fact that she preached at all, because of her gender. On 10 February 1628, king Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden ordered that her \\"Foolishness and insanity\\" was to be stopped: all pilgrimages to her was to be discontinued by threat of imprisonment and Margareta herself were to be imprisoned if she did not discontinue her speeches. This order ended the affair: the pilgrimages to Kumla stopped, and Margareta apparently did no longer preach. Nothing more is heard of how the affair ended. However, in 1629, her father formally reported to the Bishop that the Devil had tormented his parish as well as his own daughter, and on a church meeting in 1630, the case of Margareta i Kumla is described as a case of demonic possession. It is therefore likely that the church performed an exorcism upon her. Aftermath The visions of Margareta i Kumla was famous in Sweden in the 17th century. Her visions and alleged meetings with demons and angels were described by Bishop Laurentius Paulinus Gothus in a meeting of the Swedish clergy in 1629, and published in 1642.

It was established in 1914 as a mounted cavalry unit recruited primarily from indigenous Moroccan horsemen. The regiment saw service in the First World War, and in the Second World War as part of the Forces Françaises Libres, as well as post-war service in the French-Indochina War and elsewhere. The modern regiment continues the traditions of all former Spahi regiments in the French Army of Africa.  History World War I= The 1st Moroccan Spahi Regiment, 1e RSM in 1915. The Moroccan Spahis of the French Army were created in 1914 by Général Hubert Lyautey. The initial title of the regiment was that of the Régiment de Marche de Chasseurs Indigènes à Cheval (R.M.C.I.C). The French Army had already raised four regiments of indigenous cavalry in both Algeria and Tunisia during the 19th century, and extended the designation of \\"spahis\\" to the Moroccan mounted units recruited after 1908. The first Marching Moroccan Spahi Regiment (Régiment de Marche\\"Marching Regiment\\" denoted a French Army unit raised and detached for a particular service de Spahis Marocains, R.M.S.M) participated in the First Battle of the Marne. Subsequently, sent to the Orient Front, the regiment served with distinction at Pogradec, Skumbi, Bofnia, Uskub and on the Danube. The regiment was accordingly awarded 5 citations and a fourragere with the colors of the Médaille militaire. =Inter-war period= The regiment was redesignated as the 21st Moroccan Spahi Regiment (21e Régiment de Spahis Marocains, 21e R.S.M.) in 1921 and served in the campaigns in the Levant from 1920 to 1927. The regiment was awarded 3 additional citations plus a fourragere in the colors of the Croix de guerre des théâtres d'opérations extérieures. In 1929, the regiment was renamed as the 1st Moroccan Spahi Regiment (1er Régiment de Spahis Marocains, 1er R.S.M). =World War II= On July 1, 1940, Captain Paul Jourdier, who commanded the 1st Squadron of the 1st Moroccan Spahi Regiment, (1e RSM) decided to defect from the Vichy-led Army of the Levant and join the British forces in Palestine. While on maneuvers in southern Lebanon, Jourdier succeeded in detaching a small contingent comprising half of his squadron.« Le 1er escadron du 1er régiment de marche de spahis marocains » , Revue de la France Libre, n° 29, juin 1950, et « le ralliement du 1er escadron du 1er régiment de spahis marocains » , Revue de la France Libre, n° 240, 3e trimestre 1982. The 1st RSM at this stage in the war was still a mounted cavalry unit, consisting of mostly North African Muslim troopers under French officers. Reinforced by detached units that had separately crossed the border between Lebanon and Palestine, plus volunteers from London, the squadron undertook mounted operations in Eretria. The squadron conducted horse-mounted cavalry charges at Umbrega, still under the leadership of Captain Paul Jourdier. The defection of a regular cavalry unit of the Vichy forces was widely publicized by the British and Free French forces, making use of photographs showing charging spahis. The regiment was subsequently dismounted and participated in the Syria–Lebanon Campaign on trucks, as part of the 1st Free French Brigade. Other squadrons were created, forming first one then two army corps reconnaissance groups (GRCA), commanded by Jourider and Robert de Kersauson. Reinforced by a company of the 501e Régiment de chars de combat of the Free French Forces, the 2nd Group constituted the Free French Flying Column which participated in the Battle of El Alamein. It subsequently participated in the advance to Tunisia, initially as part of the British 8th Army, then in 1943 in the FFF commanded by Général Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque. On September 25, 1942, the two Groups were merged to form the 1st Moroccan Spahi Marching Regiment (), under the command of Jean Rémy. As a reconnaissance regiment of the 2nd Armored Division 2e DB, the 1st RMSM participated in the Liberation, suffering heavy losses in both France and Germany. The original (i.e. non-regiment de march) 1e RSM saw mounted horse combat in Syria before being motorized in Morocco during 1943. The unit then took part in the battle of Royan, France in 1945. It was subsequently merged with the 8th Dragoon Regiment ().  Decorations  The 1st Marching Moroccan Spahi Regiment 1er RMSM was awarded the distinction of Compagnon de la Libération by decree of August 7, 1945 and cited twice at the orders of the armed forces.

One squadron of the 1st RSM served in the First Indochina War, between 1945 and October 1946. During the post-war era the regiment underwent several changes in title, as well as being transferred between a number of different garrisons. In 1947, the regiment was designated as the 1st Regiment of Moroccan Spahis (), a title it retained during its remaining service in Morocco. In 1956 the 1st RSM was transferred to Algeria. The regiment was then re-designated as the 1st Regiment of Spahis (). In October 1958 its title was again changed to the 21st Regiment of Spahis () - in order to avoid confusion with the 1st Regiment of Algerian Spahis (). =Modern= The 1st Spahi Regiment continued in the French Army after the end of the Algerian War in 1962, although most of the other units of the former Armee d'Afrique were disbanded. Reportedly one of General Charles de Gaulle's ministers urged that the 1st RSM be retained in service because of its distinguished role in the Free French Forces during World War II. De Gaulle responded: * \\" On ne dissout pas un Compagnon de la Libération. \\" (\\"One does not dissolve a Companion of the Liberation\\"). In 1961, the regiment was transferred to Speyer Germany, as part of the French Forces of Germany (). Its role was that of a reconnaissance regiment of the 2nd Army Corps 2e CA. In 1965, following the dissolution of the 1st Regiment of Algerian Spahis, the regiment was given its present-day title of the 1st Spahi Regiment (). In 1984 the regiment was transferred from Germany and the FFA, to be incorporated in the 6th Light Armoured Division 6e DLB and garrisoned in Valence. The regiment participated in Opération Daguet during 1991, as part of the French contingent in the Gulf War. In 2009, the regiment left the 6th Light Armoured Brigade 6e BLB and joined the 1st Mechanized Brigade. On August 1, 2015, the regiment was reintegrated in the 6th Light Armoured Brigade. The regiment's armored vehicle core consists of 48 AMX, 90 VAB and 110 trucks. The regiment trains new recruits at headquarters; including armored vehicle crewmen and various mechanical trades as well as musicians and non-commissioned officers.http://www.defense.gouv.fr/terre/presentation/organisation-des- forces/arme-blindee-cavalerie/1er-regiment-de-spahis The most decorated unit of the modern Armoured Arms and Armoured Cavalry branch of the French Army, the regiment carries 14 battle honors on its colors.

A dark blue over-cloak with hood was worn over the burnous, to distinguish the Moroccan spahis from their red-cloaked Algerian and Tunisian counterparts. After mechanization, features such as the double burnous/cloak and red sash of the historical Spahi uniform were retained and are still worn by the modern regiment on parade. A red forage cap of a model worn since the 1940s, is another present-day distinguishing feature.

Another 3 843 people have been counted as \\"Egyptians\\" (0.2%). Other sources claim the number to be between 80 000 and 260 000 Roma in North Macedonia or approximately 4 to 12% of the total population. The municipality of Šuto Orizari is the only municipality in the world with a Romani majority and the only municipality where Romani is an official language alongside Macedonian. The mayor of the municipality, Kurto Dudush, is an ethnic Roma. In 2009, the Government of the Republic of North Macedonia took measures to enlarge inclusion of Romani in the education process. North Macedonia is the region's leader in respecting the rights of the Romani people. It is the first country in the region with a minister of Romani ethnicity and also has many Romani in high government positions. However, there is still a lot to be done concerning the education and integration of the Romani. HistoryOrigin= The Romani people originate from Northern India,Current Biology. presumably from the northwestern Indian states Rajasthan and Punjab. The linguistic evidence has indisputably shown that roots of Romani language lie in India: the language has grammatical characteristics of Indian languages and shares with them a big part of the basic lexicon, for example, body parts or daily routines. More exactly, Romani shares the basic lexicon with Hindi and Punjabi. It shares many phonetic features with Marwari, while its grammar is closest to Bengali. Genetic findings in 2012 suggest the Romani originated in northwestern India and migrated as a group. According to a genetic study in 2012, the ancestors of present scheduled tribes and scheduled caste populations of northern India, traditionally referred to collectively as the Ḍoma, are the likely ancestral populations of the modern European Roma.

Nicholas in his missionary work in Japan. Initially, the future St. Nicholas of Japan assigned Fr. Anatoly to his original church in Hakodate on Hokkaido island in northern Japan. During his years in Japan before he returned to Russia due to illness, Archimandrite Anatoly organized and taught schools in Hakodate and Osaka as well as serving as dean of the language school and organizing the seminary in Tokyo.  Life  Fr. Anatoly was originally from Bessarabia. He was born 23 November 1839 in Tărăsăuţi, Hotin district in northern part of Moldova (Bessarabia). He graduated from the Chişinău Theological Seminary and from the Kiev Theological Academy and lived on Mount Athos for four years before he was assigned to assist Fr. Nicholas with his mission work in Japan. The hieromonk Anatoly arrived in Japan during December 1871 while Fr. Nicholas' activities were still centered in Hakodate. After reviewing the status of the missionary effort in Japan with Fr. Anatoly, Fr. Nicholas assigned Fr. Anatoly to the existing parish at Hakodate, thus continuing the community that had formed there. This allowed Fr. Nicholas to move his activities to Edo (Tokyo). In 1873, Fr. Anatoly established the Motomachi Orthodox Primary School in Hakodate where he taught for the next seven years. By 1880, the school had an enrollment of 300. In 1880, Fr. Anatoly was raised to the rank of Archimandrite and also was called by Bp. Nicholas to come to the Kanda Surugadai headquarters in Tokyo to become the dean of the language school and the newly organized seminary. Here he taught theology to the seminarians and assisted Bp. Nicholas. As the Mission expanded, Fr. Anatoly was assigned in 1882 to organize a mission school in Osaka. In the late 1880s Archimandrite Anatoly's health began to fail, and in the summer of 1890 he returned to Russia where he reposed in 1893.

With Dmitri Lvovsky, he established a liturgical music school in Tokyo on the grounds of the Japanese mission to educate Japanese Christians in the new forms of music and to teach Japanese choir leaders for the new parishes. Life Не graduated from the Chişinău Theological Seminary. He was recommended by his older brother, archimandrite Anatoly (Tikhai), to then archimandrite Nicholas of Japan, and became Fr. Nicholas' principal arranger of Russian liturgical music to Japanese translations during the early decades of the Japanese mission. Yakov Tikhai came from the Romanian village of Tărăsăuţi, in the Hotin district in northern Moldova (Bessarabia), and arrived to Japan in early 1874 to assist his brother the Archimandrite Anatoly at his assignment to the parish in Hakodate, Japan. Fr. Anatoly had succeeded Fr. Nicholas in the Hakodate parish when Fr. Nicholas transferred his mission headquarters to Tokyo. Later, Yakov was invited by Fr. Nicholas to serve as choirmaster at Suragadai Kanda. Under the guidance of Bp. Nicholas, Yakov arranged the music for almost all the needed texts used in the Divine Liturgy, major feasts, baptism, funerals, the first week of Great Lent, and Passion Week. As his successor, Victor Pokrovsky under Metr. Sergius needed to do, Yakov found it necessary to change the music to meet the different sense and structure of the Japanese language. Yakov married Yelena Yokoi, daughter of a prominent Japanese family, in 1876. During a visit to Odessa in 1887, Yakov died. His wife and children later returned to Japan.

It is the second fastest Rajdhani service in all of India, surpassed by only the Bandra Rajdhani, with an average running speed (ARS) of nearly 88 km/h. It was introduced on 17 May 1972 between the then Bombay Central (MMCT) and New Delhi. The train became so popular that prior to the introduction of current reservation facility its reservation chart was prepared just 15 minutes before the scheduled departure of the train. It is a daily service. It operates as train number 12951 down from Mumbai Central to New Delhi and as train number 12952 up in the reverse direction.The train has been portrayed in the film The Rajdhani Express.  Coaches  The Mumbai Rajdhani generally has one AC 1st Class coach, five AC 2 tier class coaches, one pantry car, two luggage cum generator coaches & eleven AC 3 tier coaches taking the total up to 20 coaches. Since its inception, the Mumbai Rajdhani ran with 16 coaches. However, the conventional rakes were replaced by Linke-Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches for this train in August 2004, and the number of coaches was also increased to 19 including the pantry cars. The number of coaches again was increased to 21 by the Western Railways to accommodate more passengers in June 2012. No Extra private coach or party coach is attached in this train.  Service  At Platform Number 1 of Mumbai central The 12951/12952 Mumbai Rajdhani Express is the fastest train on the Mumbai - Delhi sector and the fastest Rajdhani train as well as the fastest train (Considering ARS and including halts) in India. Mumbai Rajdhani Express is the first Rajdhani to get Alstom-LHB Coaches in India. It used to run six days a week until September 2000 after which Railways decided to run it daily. In its early days, it used to cover the distance of 1385 kilometres in each direction in 19 hours and 5 minutes. However, after the electrification of the route, the speed of the train improved and as of 2018, it takes 15 hours and 35 minutes when operating as train number 12951 at an average speed of 89 km/h (including halts) while on its return journey as train number 12952 takes 15 hrs 50 mins at an average speed of 88 km/h (including halts) thus making it the fastest train on the Mumbai - Delhi sector. Before the introduction of the LHB coaches, the maximum speed that could be attained with the conventional rakes was 120 km/h.But after introduction of LHB rakes the highest speed that could possibly be attained is 160 km/h but is restrictred to 130 km/h due to Head-On-Generation Technology. After their introduction, the LHB coaches enhanced the speed of the Rajdhani to more than 120 km/h and even touching 130 km/h most of the time. The highest attained speed was 140 km/h between Asaoti and Mathura, but it was only on trial basis for one month . Recently Virar- Vadodara-Godhra Section top speed is enhanced from 120 km/h to 130 km/h. Hence, Mumbai Rajdhani's time reduced from 16 hours to 15 hr 35 minutes while it continues to be the fastest train in India (including halts) with average speed of 91 km/h.It is the first train to be experimented with HOG (Head On Generation) which powers the train directly from locomotive instead of an EOG or generator van . Traction When the train was introduced in 1972, it was hauled by a single WDM-2 end-to-end. To maintain the speed and schedule, sometimes 2 locomotives were used. In the 1980s, it used to be hauled by a Ghaziabad-based WAP-1 electric locomotive between New Delhi and Vadodara, while the rest of the journey was completed by diesel locomotive. The New Delhi–Mumbai main line was completely electrified in 1987, which made it possible to have electric traction end-to-end as well as improvement in speed. This enabled the WCAM 1 locomotive to haul the train till Vadodara station due to DC traction in suburban section of Mumbai. In 1995-96, the WCAM-2 locomotive replaced the WCAM-1 as the new locomotive had more power and higher speed, while the WAP-1 was replaced by the WAP-4 and subsequently by the WAP-5 or WAP-7. Until 2012, from Mumbai Central to Vadodara, the WCAM-2 pulled it after which a WAP-5 or WAP-7 of Vadodara or Ghaziabad hauled it for remainder of journey. Post conversion of 1500 V DC to 25 kV AC traction in February 2012, it is now hauled by a Vadodara based WAP-7 end-to-end. On 24 August, the express was tested with push pull technology from Mumbai Central to New Delhi as 12951 using Vadodara based WAP-7 or WAP-5 Stoppage * ''''''   * '''''' Incidents On 18 April 2011, three coaches of the train caught fire, including the pantry car.

He followed in a tradition of Russian missionaries of bringing the Gospel to new people in their language. In Japan, he followed in the tradition of Ss. Innocent of Moscow and Nicholas of Japan, and of Nicholas's successor Sergius. In regard to liturgical music of the Japanese Orthodox Church, Victor Pokrovsky was to Sergius as Yakov Tikhai was to St. Nicholas. Victor successfully brought the Russian liturgical music masters to the Japanese in their own language. Metr. Sergius invited Victor, an émigré of the Russian civil war, to Tokyo to help him introduce 19th and 20th century Russian liturgical works in Japanese. Their close collaboration continued until World War II brought it to an end.  Life  Victor A. PokrovskyVictor was born on February 13, 1897, the first son of Fr. Alexander Andreevich and Nadezhda Petrovna (née Ismailov). His father was the priest at a church in the Suhaya Rika district near Kazan, Russia. The Pokrovskys were a priestly family. Their family name was Gremyashkin, but during the time of Tsar Paul I of Russia, Victor's priestly ancestor was given the family name of Pokrovsky by his bishop who visited his parish on the day of the Protection of the Theotokos (Pokrov). Victor studied for four years at the Kazan Theological Seminary before entering Kazan University in 1914. As a university student he sang with the Morreff Choir, which Mr. Ivan Kolchin (later choir director of Holy Trinity Cathedral in San Francisco) also joined, and attended the conductor class at Kazan Hummert Music School. After three years of student life, he was called into the Army as an officer, but was released after the February Revolution. He then returned to the Kazan University for his fourth year. After the Bolshevik coup of 1917, he was recalled to army service in 1918 into the White Army, to advance eventually to the rank of Captain. As the Red Army advanced, he was forced to leave Kazan and retreat with the White Army across Siberia. With the end of the Civil War, he ended up in Manchuria and was discharged on May 12, 1923. Having lost everything, including his family, he set to organizing a choir to earn a living. As Manchuria included a large Russian population prior to the war that supported and operated the Trans-Siberian Railway short cuts to Vladivostok, a Russian-based lifestyle was available for his choir to work in. Indeed, the Harbin Archdiocese was active, as the situation in Russia deteriorated, including supporting the Church of Japan. After the Great Kantō earthquake of September 1, 1923, severely damaged the Holy Resurrection Cathedral in Tokyo, the then Archbishop Sergius often visited Harbin to obtain support for restoring the Cathedral. Amongst his activities, Sergius was looking for a capable leader for the choir at the cathedral. Among the candidates that the archbishop interviewed he liked the music of Victor Pokrovsky who was directing the choir at the Holy Theotokos Church in Harbin. Invited by the archbishop, Victor moved to Japan in 1924 to form a full-scale choir at the Holy Resurrection Cathedral and to introduce the new Russian masterpieces, such as those by Arkhangelsky and Kastalsky. For the next sixteen years Victor was deeply engaged in developing a first-class choir and learning Japanese so as to translate and arrange the new masterpieces for the choir. During this time he found time to marry a Russian young lady, but suffered tragedy when she died in childbirth, leaving him a son to raise. A couple of years later he married again, to a young lady from Harbin with whom he had two daughters. He and the archbishop, later named Metropolitan of All Japan, worked closely as the choir developed and the Cathedral was restored, until in 1940 the militaristic government, championing extreme nationalism, forced the non-Japanese leaders in the Church of Japan to \\"retire.\\" Now, Victor searched for a new position. He was invited to a position in San Francisco, but the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred before their ship could leave Japan. Thus, he and his family spent the war in Japan, first living in Yokohoma and then later during and after the war in Karuizawa in the Japanese Alps. The last time they saw Metr. Sergius was when he came to Yokohoma during the summer of 1943 to baptize their second daughter. But, in the chaos of the war Victor was able to travel from Karuizawa to attend Sergius' funeral. The war years proved to be very difficult, often living a starvation diet and, for Victor, an arrest on spying charges. It was many years before the family could return to Tokyo, but after returning Victor was invited by the new ruling bishop, Bishop Ireney, to resume his position directing the Holy Resurrection Cathedral choir. He restored the choir and again continued the work that was interrupted in 1940. Then in 1962, Victor, with his wife and younger daughter, immigrated to the United States where he led choirs in a number of parishes before retiring in 1972 in Vienna, Virginia. He died on February 12, 1990, and is buried at St. Tikhon's Orthodox Monastery (South Canaan, Pennsylvania), a place that he said reminded him of the Russia he left so many years before.  Musical Work  Much of the following is based upon a study of Pokrovsky's musical work by Maria Junko Matsushima, of the Holy Annunciation Church in Nagoya, Japan. Victor Pokrovsky was 27 years old when he assumed his duties under Metropolitan Sergius. As with the earlier Russian missionaries, St. Nicholas of Japan and Metr. Sergius himself, he began his work first learning the Japanese language as the grammatical and syllablical differences between Japanese and Slavonic made it difficult to translate and fit words to the musical notes. This was hard work, and in accomplishing this task he was assisted for many years by Father Job Hibi and a seminary student Jacob who later was ordained Father Jacob. He frequently worked until two or three o'clock in the morning. He worked hard developing the cathedral choir, and in this work he also had the full support of Sergius. He was very strict in his rehearsals, sometimes bringing some of the young women singers to tears, but he did this for the love of the music and a loving integrity of the choir and choir members as a superior singing group. Rehearsals were held twice a week, Wednesday evenings and Sunday afternoons. Often Sergius sat in back, listening to their singing, and even chided some lazy choir members. In time the choir recognized this discipline and personally came to Victor to acknowledge his intent. Victor worked carefully on the timing and the flow of the services. He coordinated tones with the clergy so they and the choir remained in harmony. Yet, during the service he could quickly adjust the choir's pitch to fit the intonation of the clergy when necessary. For Victor, the services were a whole, not a bunch of pieces. In this even, Metropolitan Sergius was careful, often heard coordinating on which Cherubic hymn version Victor would sing that day so that he could decide on his pitch. The choir's repertory expanded quickly. They sang the music of Tchaikovsky, Smolensky, Strokin, Chesnokov, Arkhangelsky, and Kastalsky. Some years later, thanks to his pupil Tito Kato, Victor's music was published in Osaka. There were some 75 titles, and many of them, for example, Smolensky�?'s Paschal Stichera, and Makarov�?'s The Angel Cried, are still sung in many churches in Japan. The hard work of these early years came together in the singing at the re-consecration ceremony for the rebuilt Holy Resurrection Cathedral on December 15, 1929. Afterwards Metropolitan Sergius praised him: \\"Victor Alexandrovich Pokrovsky, a great choir director who has done hard work since 1924. His name will be kept in the history of music in Japan. Our choir[s] are not only good singers but artistic and full of spirit.\\" (Tokyo Holy Resurrection Cathedral and the Earthquake, by Metr. Sergius.)

The settlement is effectively an outer suburb of Andover, and is located approximately south-west of the town centre. The name 'Anna' derives from the Celtic river 'Anne' meaning 'Ash tree stream' now known as Pillhill Brook on the Ordnance Survey Landranger map, though it is still known as the River Ann to older local people. Tasker Waterloo Ironworks (Taskers of Andover) opened here in 1815 and survived as a manufacturing industry until final closure in 1984. The site is now a modern housing development though there are still signs of Tasker's influence in the village in the form of workmen's houses, a line of terraced houses built for the workers and the former Tasker's hall which is now private housing. Originally much of the land occupied by the later foundry at the far end of the village was marsh land, known as Clatford Marsh. Robert Tasker noted the fact that the village had quarrying rights to chalk in the nearby hillside. By exploiting this right and quarrying an acre of chalk from the hillside it enabled the marshland to be filled with the quarried materials to act as foundations for the new Iron Foundry situated alongside the PillHill brook which would serve as a source of water power for the foundry. This chalk quarry is still very much in evidence (it is owned by the Parish Council) and can be seen from the road and a footpath that passes along the hillside behind the village leading to the Iron Age hillfort of Bury Hill. On 20 November 1830 a mob of rioters came from Andover town, they smashed a bridge in Upper Clatford that carried the road over the river Anton and proceeded to vandalise and damage fixtures and equipment at the foundry. A number of arrests were made by a detachment of local Yeomanry and the Duke of Wellington Sir Arthur Wellesley sat on the board of assizes held at Winchester jail when the ringleaders were sentenced to be hanged and a number to be transported to Australia for their crimes. In 1843 Tasker Ironworks installed a new cast iron bridge in Upper Clatford that exists today, carrying the road over the river Anton towards Church Lane. A later iron foot bridge was installed in Andover in 1851 to carry Ladies Walk over the new Micheldever Road that was cut through the chalk hillside. The village once had 2 public houses, one situated at the bottom of Sam Whites hill, on the road to Upper Clatford, the hill so being named for a former landlord of the pub. A second public house stood almost opposite Tasker Ironworks. On Wednesday July 13, 1910 the British Army airship Beta was flying over Andover when the crankshaft broke. The airship was landed at Little Park Farm and was later towed by Royal Engineers to the chalk pit opposite Tasker Waterloo Ironworks. A new engine was brought from Farnborough, Hampshire and repairs assisted by the Ironworks factory. Beta remained in the chalk pit all night and most of the following day. Crowds gathered to witness this novel sight. Old chalk pit just off Foundry Road, Anna Valley. This is where the Beta airship docked on the night of July 13th 1910. The village and post office shop was demolished in December 2013, having closed a few years earlier.

Career Love served as corporate executive pastry chef for Ritz-Carlton from 1988-2001, opening hotel pastry kitchens in such locations as Boston, Dubai and Bali. Love left Ritz-Carlton after 13 years to focus on the culinary event production company, Carymax LLC, with co-founder Michael Schneider. The company's pastry competitions were a hit with viewers and became the basis for the TV series Food Network Challenge. In 2001, Love founded Norman Love Confections (originally named Ganache Chocolates) with Sarasota-based pastry chef Judy Limekiller. The co-owners began producing unique ultra-premium chocolates for hotels, resorts, and restaurants, but quickly found success with retail customers. In February 2002, USA Today named Ganache Chocolates one of the top 10 artisan chocolate companies in the country. Schneider, who was editor-in-chief of Chocolatier magazine at the time, was a primary source for the story. With a reputation for excellence and his network of connections in the industry, it wasn't long before Love was approached by Godiva to design limited-edition flavors for their \\"G\\" line. In 2004, Love re-named the chocolate company \\"Norman Love Confections\\", and he and Limekiller parted ways. Following this transformation, Love continued to build his brand and utilized product placement at charity events to generate visibility in his community. In February 2005, Norman Love Confections was rated one of the top three chocolate companies in the country by Consumer Reports. Love was one of only 26 selected to appear on Julia Child's show \\"Baking with Julia\\" on PBS, creating Banana Stuffed Cinnamon Sugar Beignets.

CFU-GEMM cells are the oligopotential progenitor cells for myeloid cells; they are thus also called common myeloid progenitor cells or myeloid stem cells. \\"GEMM\\" stands for granulocyte, erythrocyte, monocyte, megakaryocyte. The common myeloid progenitor (CMP) and the common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) are the first branch of cell differentiation in hematopoiesis after the hemocytoblast (hematopoietic stem cell). Structure In current terminology, CFU-S refers to the pluripotent stem cells that can differentiate into all types of blood cells. CFU-S divides into two lineages: the lymphoid precursor (CFU-LSC) and the myeloid precursor (CFU-GEMM). The CFU-GEMM cell is capable of differentiating into white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets, all of which are normally found in circulating blood. It has been suggested that eosinophils do not derive from the common myeloid progenitor in humans. thumb In the adjacent image, CFU-GEMM is the scientific name for the \\"common myeloid progenitor\\" that is responsible for forming all the cells of the myeloid lineages. As observed in the image, CFU-GEMM is capable of producing a diverse set of cells. It matures into the megakaryocyte, erythrocyte, mast cell or myeloblast based on the presence of specific factors that encourage the cell to choose a lineage to follow. =Surface markers= Cell surface markers allow the immune system to recognize self and non-self cells in addition to making cell sorting by flow cytometry possible. The cells are characterized by expressing the cell surface markers CD33, CD34 and HLA-DR. These surface markers are proteins on the surface that are unique to specific cells and certain maturation periods, allowing researchers to differentiate between two different cells as well as what stage the cell is found in its developmental progression. DevelopmentGrowth factors= The differentiation and proliferation of CFU-GEMM are promoted by growth factors, such as interleukins and cytokines. IL-3 and GM-CSF as single factors are equally active in stimulating CFU-GEMM, but the combination of both factors produces additive stimulatory effects upon CFU-GEMM. The growth of CFU-GEMM is stimulated by the stem cell factor, or SCF. SCF has been found also to synergize with GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-3, IL-11 or erythropoietin to increase the numbers of CFU-GEMM. CFU- GEMM gives rise to CFU-GM (leading to monoblasts and myeloblasts), CFU-Meg (leading to megakaryoblasts), and CFU-E (leading to proerythroblasts). The stem cell will follow a specific lineage depending on the presence of certain growth factors and cytokines. The GM-CSF and IL-3 both work together to stimulate production of all lines. When erythropoietin (EPO) is present, red blood cell production from the CFU-GEMM will be activated. G-CSF, M-CSF, IL-5, IL-4, and IL-3 stimulate the production of neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and platelets, respectively. Research studies Since the CFU-GEMM cell is a very early ancestor of the mature cells of the blood, it is not normally found in the blood. While present in bone marrow, the place where CFU-GEMM is most common is in the umbilical cord between a mother and baby. It has been discovered that these cells have a high replating efficiency, meaning that when taken from the umbilical cord and grown in culture, a high percentage of these cells are able to produce colonies. The results of studies conducted by Carow, Hangoc, and Broxmeyer in 1993 reveal that the CFU-GEMM can be classified as a stem cell due to its high replating efficiency in the presence of certain growth factors and cytokines. The growth and production of CFU-GEMM and BFU-E depend on stimulatory factors from a source of burst-promoting activity (BPA) such as the release of interleukin-1 (IL-1) by monocytes, a has been studied in 1987. It has also been shown that fibroblasts are capable of secreting these BPAs, however only respond to regulatory molecule such as interleukin-1. The results showed that IL-1 increases the stimulatory effects of CFU-GEMM in a dose-dependent fashion with a maximum efficacy around 140 ng/mL. This study revealed that IL-1 plays an important role in the regulation of the production of stimulatory factors that influence the progenitor cells of hematopoiesis. In another study in 2014, researchers were in search of molecules to stimulate the proliferation of long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSC). They tested a library of more than 5000 small molecules, with all except one (UM729) suppressing growth. A more potent analog was generated and named UM171. When compared to other similar chemicals, UM171 allowed for more HSC proliferation and lower apoptotic cell number compared to controls, along with a higher number in multipotential progenitors like CFU-GEMM. Furthermore, UM171 did not affect division rate. When used in conjunction with SR1, a known transcription factor, UM171 allowed for suppression of differentiation and led to increased CFU-GEMM growth. These results suggest that UM171+SR1 together enhance proliferation of progenitor cells and suppress differentiation.

Developed by Titijaya Group's subsidiary of NPO Development, the RM300 million development is expected to take up of freehold land. Klang Sentral is also the new controversial and highly debated ultra-modern transport terminal for the local and intercity bus and taxi services in Klang. The RM40 million bus and taxi terminal which started to operate on 27 December 2008 is located nearby to the Setia Alam (part of Shah Alam) and Aman Perdana (part of Klang) townships. It is situated about 9 kilometers away from the Klang town centre.  History  Klang Sentral was a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) project between the developer and the Klang Municipal Council (MPK). The concession agreement was signed in January 2007 during the administration of the former Barisan Nasional state government in Selangor. The project was planned by Selangor State Urban Planning Department (JPBD) for the development of Klang Town in the 1990s. The plan was taken seriously by Klang Municipal Council (MPK) when the former Klang bus and taxi terminal was burnt down by fire on 19 May 2003 and increasing traffic congestion in the town. The developer of Klang Sentral had built the terminal and contribute the land to the state government, with total cost of RM 40million to the developer. For this reason, the developer was given a 30-year concession rights to operate the bus and taxi terminal after which the ownership of the terminal shall be given to MPK. It is one of the few project that is continued by the administration of Pakatan Rakyat state government in Selangor. However, if MPK decides not to relocate the former Klang bus and taxi terminal (which is located right in the heart of the town centre) to Klang Sentral, MPK will have to pay a sum of RM13 million compensation charges to the developer.

Controversies  The express and local stage bus terminal on the left and the Kuala Lumpur-bound bus terminal on the right at Klang Sentral, separated by the Petronas gas pipeline land in between. Even though before the new bus and taxi terminal at Klang Sentral starts to operate, there have been a few controversies surrounding the project. The development itself is located at the far north end of Klang and is not within the vicinity of the Klang town centre. It is also located far away from the Klang Komuter station. Many passengers and bus operators have complained about the higher transportation costs and longer time spent to commute around. Bus operators at Klang Sentral were being charged RM900 of rental fees per month compared with just RM150 at the old Klang bus terminal in the town centre. At the same time, buses are now charged RM10 per entry at Klang Sentral compared with just RM2 at the old station previously. Shops and stall traders at Klang Sentral have also complained about high rental charges. The single-way bus fare to Kuala Selangor from the former bus station was RM4 while the fare from Klang Sentral is RM5.30. After clarification with Cityliner, the largest bus operator in Malaysia, it is confirmed that single-way bus fare to Kuala Selangor from former bus station is RM5.30, while it is only RM 4.30 from Klang Sentral. Cityliner reaffirmed that there shall be no additional cost passed to the consumer. The Klang Consumer Association had been protesting against the relocation of the terminal to Klang Sentral since 2005. In addition to that, there are numerous industrial factories nearby, which is a cause for environmental concerns. Also, Klang Sentral is expected to increase the already bad major traffic congestion along Jalan Meru and Jalan Kapar, the two main artery roads in Klang. After 9 months of operations, Klang Sentral Terminal B for local buses closed down, in June 2009. Terminal A for outstation buses is still open.

In its heyday – in the 1970s – the plant employed around 40,000 people and annually produced almost 7 million tons of steel. In the 1980s, it was one of the most important centers of anticommunist resistance, with numerous strikes and street demonstrations taking place in Nowa Huta. In January 2005, the plant was purchased by the Mittal Steel Company and now it is owned by Arcelor-Mittal, the largest steelmaker in the world. Its current name is ArcelorMittal Poland S.A.

The Kochersberg is a natural region of the French département of Bas-Rhin in Alsace and is a part of the hills found along the eastern side of the Vosges mountains. It gave its name to the Communauté de communes du Kochersberg, a cooperation of 23 municipalities. Its name comes from the Kochersberg hill; its highest peak (301 m), stands over Neugartheim-Ittlenheim. A castle was built on its top in the 13th century but was destroyed three centuries later. Its only relief is its peripheral ditch. Between 1794 and 1797, a semaphore tower was built in its place. It was the second relay (after Dingsheim), of the optical telegraph line from Strasbourg to Paris via Saverne and its pass and was used until 1852. This relay has been replaced in the late 20th century by a motionless memorial which can still be seen (weather permitting), from ten kilometers away.

It arises from CFU-GEMM (via BFU-E, which stands for \\"erythroid burst-forming units\\") and gives rise to proerythroblasts. mouse CFU-E colonies stained on Day 3 with Diaminobenzidine for hemoglobin Murine CFU-E assay CFU-E is a stage of erythroid development between the BFU-E stage and the pro-erythroblast stage. CFU-E colony assay is designed to detect how many colony-forming-units of erythroid lineage there are in a hematopoietic tissue (bone marrow, spleen, or fetal liver), which may be reflective of the organism’s demand for oxygen delivery to the tissues or a hematopoietic disorder. Early erythroid progenitors are found at a quite low frequency relative to later stages of erythroid differentiation, such as the pro-erythroblast and the basophilic erythroblast stages which can be detected by flowcytometry directly ex-vivo (). Furthermore, unlike for the pro-erythroblast and later stages of erythroid development, no truly reliable and unique positive flow-cytometric markers exist, though it is possible to use negative exclusion markers to deplete a cell population of other precursors and differentiated cells by cell sorting, thus greatly enriching it for the CFU-E activity (Prospective isolation and global gene expression analysis of the erythrocyte colony-forming unit, Terszowski G. et al. Blood 2005). CFU-E cells express Epo receptor, c-Kit (Stem cell factor receptor), transferrin receptor (CD71+), and are Ter119(glycophorin-A associated antigen)-negative. For the above reasons, the CFU-E assay, as inefficient and variable as it can often be, is still in use today. Cells at the CFU-E stage express some erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), and thus can be induced to terminally differentiate in vitro in 2–3 days in the presence of only erythropoietin (Epo) (together with the basic contents of culture media: FBS, BSA in IMDM). Methylcellulose is a semisolid media additive that allows an investigator to stain (with diaminobenzidine reagent for hemoglobin) and then count individual colonies, each arising from a single plated progenitor that is at the CFU-E stage. By day 2 from the time of plating, each CFU-E colony will contain between 8 (minimum) and 64 hemoglobinized cells most of which are in their end-stage of erythroid differentiation. It is possible to see a small spectrum of hemoglobinization level and possibly cell size, indicating that some cells in the colony have achieved the end-stage faster than others. Cell number in a colony is important because pro-erythroblast stage is also Epo-responsive (expresses Epo receptor), but the proliferative capacity of these cells is not as high, thus yielding a colony with fewer than 8 cells. Likewise, an earlier stage of erythroid differentiation may also yield colonies in Epo-only medium, but these colonies would likely be smaller and/or not hemoglobinized, since the stages before the CFU-E stage (MEP and BFU-E) require other factors (IL-3 etc) and more time for growth that will also delay the terminal differentiation and hemoglobinization.

It was officially formed on 1 January 2009 following the closure of three predecessor schools in the area. It serves a wide rural area in the Rother Valley of West Sussex and is sponsored by one of the largest academy groups in the country, United Learning. The college also has partnerships with the University of Chichester and Winchester College. Formation The academy was formed in January 2009. This followed the closure of three predecessor schools operating as part of a three-tier structure: Midhurst Grammar School, Midhurst Intermediate School and Petworth's Herbert Shiner School. The Grammar school - with a history dating back to 1672 \\\\- had accommodated students aged 13 to 19, while both intermediate schools had students aged 10 to 13. The new school was introduced as part of the local authority's move towards two-tier provision. The school opened with students from Year Six to Year 13, but began to operate as a standard secondary from September 2009, with the youngest students being in Year Seven, aged 11. Campus In September 2012, a new school building replaced the old on the River Site Campus at a cost of £31 million. Situated at the foot of the South Downs, the building is state of the art both in its architecture and the facilities it has to offer students, staff and the community of Midhurst. The facilities include a new school bus terminus, county-standard Astro Turf pitch, multi-use games area, Amphitheatre and extensive sports grounds. The formal opening ceremony, performed by Lord Andrew Adonis took place on 19 April 2013. Lord Andrew Adonis, Minister of State for Education 2005-2008, was the original champion of the academy concept and was directly instrumental in the College's early development. During his speech he said “I am delighted to be opening MRC which is transforming education in its community. Its results last year were spectacular and attribute to its principal, governors and staff.” In a recent article written for the Academy Magazine by Lord Nash, Current Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools, he said about academy freedoms being at the heart of school improvement, “I have seen from my own experience that introducing strong performance management, professional development, coaching and reward can also make a huge difference … Midhurst Rother College in West Sussex [as an example] … has transformed management procedures since becoming an academy and has seen astonishing turnarounds in pupil performance.\\" Curriculum The school operates joint specialisms in Science and Mathematics. In addition, the school identifies aspects of Business and Enterprise, and ICT throughout the curriculum. Principal The first principal of the College was Dr Joe Vitagliano, former headteacher of Chislehurst and Sidcup Grammar School. Dr Vitagliano was formerly a pupil at the Midhurst Grammar School. History The origins of Midhurst Rother College date back to 1672 when, founder of education in Midhurst, Gilbert Hannam, set up a free school for twelve poor Protestant boys. The first classroom was in a loft, but later he moved the school to his own home which stood next door to the site on which the current College building is situated. Gilbert Hannam died on St. Patrick's Day, 17 March 1677 having set out foundations and traditions which are still followed today. Each year, on the anniversary of his death, in accordance with his Will a service is held in the Midhurst Parish Church at which scholars pray for his soul. During the service the member of clergy who delivers the sermon is presented by students with a fee of a pair of gloves.

He is the leader of the band Cordelia's Dad, a solo artist, and was a performer and consultant for the award-winning soundtrack of the film Cold Mountain. Cordelia's Dad Cordelia's Dad combines old-time music and punk rock influences to create a unique sound. The Village Voice describes the band as \\"semi-reformed punks turned shape-note singers...recently gone entirely acoustic, but buzzing with metaphorical electricity\\". The band has released nine full-length albums, played festivals such as The Newport Folk Festival, and toured with notable bands Nirvana, Uncle Tupelo, and Weezer. Musicologist Eriksen successfully defended his PhD in ethnomusicology at Wesleyan University in May 2015, having received an M.A. in the same discipline from Wesleyan in 1993, and has served as a visiting music professor at Dartmouth College, Amherst College, Hampshire College and the University of Minnesota. He has also taught in Poland and the Czech Republic. Additionally, Eriksen is a collector of variations of folk songs, and has conducted extensive research on traditional Yugoslavian music. Eriksen shared his extensive knowledge of folk music while a consultant for the soundtrack of the film Cold Mountain. In 2011, Eriksen taught a class on the history of the Sacred Harp at Smith College. Solo artist Eriksen performed on the Cold Mountain soundtrack, singing with Riley Baugus on traditional songs such as \\"I Wish My Baby Was Born\\" and \\"The Cuckoo\\". He was part of The Great High Mountain Tour, which celebrated the traditional music of Cold Mountain and O Brother, Where Art Thou? T-Bone Burnett, the producer of the Cold Mountain soundtrack, had Eriksen teach performers the complex style of Sacred Harp singing. Eriksen has also released seven solo albums: Tim Eriksen; Every Sound Below; Northern Roots Live In Namest; Soul Of The January Hills; Star in the East; Banjo, Fiddle And Voice; and Josh Billings Voyage or, Cosmopolite on the Cotton Road. The Pop Matters review of Every Sound Below describes it as a \\"stunning mixture of traditional hymns, songs from the American Civil War, and Eriksen's own compositions\\". The Sacred Harp documentary Awake, My Soul's accompanying soundtrack Help Me to Sing: Songs of the Sacred Harp features a song by Eriksen and one by Cordelia's Dad. Paste Magazine describes Eriksen's performance of Sacred Harp songs at an Atlanta concert as \\"stand-out\\" and said Eriksen \\"was best at adapting the raw power of Sacred Harp to his own arrangements.\\" Eriksen has also been a guest on the radio show A Prairie Home Companion, where he performed the traditional folk song \\"O, Death\\" on October 29, 2005. He also played Bosnian Pop music with the band Zabe I Babe.

Early years and family Italo Mus was born in Chaméran, in the municipality of Châtillon to parents from the Aosta Valley. His mother Martine Vallaise was from a noble family of Arnad; his father Eugène Mus was a sculptor from Torgnon. His earliest artistic training took place in his father's workshop where he learn woodcarving. In 1909, recommended by Lorenzo Delleani, he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in Turin and followed the course of painting and drawing. Here his teachers included Giacomo Grosso, Paolo Gaidano, Luigi Onetti and Marchisio: artists faithful to the impressionist tradition, and who taught him the basics of art. In 1910, the International Center for the Fine Arts in Rome assembled some of the best known painters of the time, including Chagall, Raoul Dufy, Jean Cocteau and Picasso. This was the occasion when the young Mus first gained national recognition, being awarded first prize in the Young Painters’ Salon. Career Although very committed to his native Aosta Valley, Mus spent short periods in 1913 working on fresco and restoration projects: first in Lyon and then in Lausanne and in Friesch near Brig in the Swiss the canton of Valais. He took part in the First World War, and while on leave he met Giuseppina Crenna. After the end of the war they married and in due course had four children. In 1932 Mus was responsible for the Saint- Vincent war memorial. The work, modelled in clay and then cast in bronze in Milan, was of an Alpino holding a weapon in his hand and with a fallen comrade across his knees. No trace of this monument remains: it was melted down in 1940 when its metal was needed for the war effort. In 1938 the art critic Guido Marangoni saw Mus’s works in his studio and was impressed enough to write an article in the art journal Perseo, describing him as a “highly talented painter.” For a time he worked in his studio at Saint-Vincent with Filippo De Pisis. In 1956 some of his paintings were shown in New York City and Buenos Aires. In the mid-1960s, while still active, he fell victim to a serious disease which prevented him from continuing to work. Italo Mus died in Saint-Vincent on 15 May 1967. Work Mus created about two thousand works: drawings, sketches, and paintings of subjects. For most of his life he used oil on canvas or panel. His activity consists of three clearly defined periods. * First period: between 1920 and 1940 he created works that characterize the artist in his best years. He painted scenes of life in the Aosta Valley (interior scenes, haymaking, landscapes and dance). * Second period: between 1941 and 1958, the style of the artist evolved, and his paintings became an excuse to make the color. The imagination takes precedence over reality and the artist also wanted to attract attention by using the technique of the effect of mold on absorbent paper. * Third period: between 1959 and 1967, the artist returned to his roots with new drawings in ink and charcoal, and sketches for major works in public buildings in the valley. Mus revisited the subjects of his first period—haymaking scenes and interiors that represent a multitude of characters—with the same humanity, but with different characteristics from the paintings of the first period. Prizes His long and laborious work was rewarded by many prizes: the Prix Saint-Vincent (1922-1947-1949), the Prix de la Montagne (‘Prize of the Mountain’, Milan 1927), the Premio Einaudi (1950), the Premio Consiglio dei Ministri (‘Italian Cabinet Prize’, Rome 1959), and the Premio Nazionale d'Arte Sacra (‘National Award for Sacred Art’, Rome 1960).

The purpose of Climate LIFE is to encourage awareness of and appreciation for the human and commercial potential in a low carbon future. The Copenhagen Climate Council With hopes for Climate LIFE to act as a catalyst for a new public discourse on climate change. FILM : “Climate LIFE - the 5th revolution” Climate LIFE - the 5th revolution is an “emotional and strong story” of a journey across the world in search of the solutions so urgently needed for avoiding a world climate life gone a wreck. It is produced in the realisation that we need a new climate agenda in order to achieve a transition to a sustainable society. The Copenhagen Climate Council has stated it is “necessary” to tell the story of climate change using a new positive language that can appeal to new audiences. Particularly, the Copenhagen Climate Council wishes to use “evocative and emotional storytelling” to get behind the real motivations, which has made pioneers, community leaders and others act on climate changes. Through compelling and evocative story-telling, the audiences will themselves feel the urgency of the quest and be inspired to take action. Climate LIFE will be a follow-up to Al Gore's 'An inconvenient truth'. Where Al Gore opened the world's eyes to the massiveness of climate change, Climate LIFE intends to tell the new convenient truth of climate change - that the knowledge and solutions we know today give us the opportunity to create communities that enhance quality of life; that it is possible to build a greener, safer and more sustainable Earth. Climate Life - the 5th revolution aims to show that the precondition for the success is already present. A short feature will be launched at the World Business Summit on Climate Change and subsequently it will be shown at events, on the web, and will also be distributed to TV broadcasters across the world. The film is produced in collaboration with Koncern Film and TV. The LIFE Digital exhibition The LIFE digital Exhibition is intended to demonstrate what makes Climate LIFE possible. When launched on the web, it will explore the delivery model necessary to achieve the vision of Climate LIFE. Looking at the political, economic and cultural systems as well as the technological and biological process that will underpin low carbon living in the future, the exhibition will present a variety of practical solutions and their implications, highlighting the state of the art in movement, energy production and efficient consumption, water and waste management etc. The exhibition aims to use the latest social software advances and interactive tools to illustrate the challenges, how they affect people, and the possibilities for getting involved. =Unlocking the Climate Code: Innovation in Climate and Energy= On June 19, 2008, Copenhagen Climate Council and Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) co-hosted an energy conference named Unlocking the Climate Code: Innovation in Climate and Energy. The aim of the conference was to identify the critical research and development achievements necessary for a successful transition to a low carbon economy. Conference participants will present and debate relevant policy and business models that can support technology innovation in carbon emissions reduction. In an effort to create models of the relationships in business, policy, and technology to help guide innovative and rational decision making at the 2009 UN Summit, a suite of tools was developed, better known as the Climate Navigator. According to Gary Baldwin, director of Special Projects at CITRIS, the Climate Navigator will have several interrelated parts and functions. It will serve as an Internet- based community forum for researchers, policy makers, and business leaders, allowing politicians and others to direct questions to experts or open on-line discussions about specific proposals. It will also be a digital library, organizing the growing base of knowledge about how business models and policy can influence technology. In addition, the Navigator will employ new technology itself, including computer modeling applications developed by Dan Kammen's lab at Berkeley. =Business Requirements of a Post-2012 Climate Treaty= On December 8, 2008, the Copenhagen Climate Council hosted an official side eventRead the entire news summary from the Poznań side event here at the UN COP14 Summit on Climate Change in Poznań, Poland from December 1–10, 2008.

(aka 4th Wall Musical Theatre) is a non-equity theatre company in residence at the Westminster Arts Center on the campus of Bloomfield College, in Bloomfield, New Jersey, approximately 10 miles from Manhattan. The group derived its name from the theatre term the fourth wall coined by Denis Diderot which describes it as “the imaginary wall at the front of the stage in a proscenium, through which the audience sees the action in the world of the play”.  History  Friends, who all worked as performers or artistic staff members at the Montclair Operetta Club in Montclair, NJ, conceived the idea of the non-profit 4th Wall Musical Theatre in 1996. The original founding members included Mark Frawley and Deborah Martin (Artistic Directors) with original board members, Richard Colonna, Lisa Hughes, Kathi Iannacone, Ed Kamholz, Nancy Marino, Gwen Ricks-Spencer, along with Charles Alexander Hay and Beth Vecchio. The group wanted to do smaller, lesser known musicals which focused more on ensemble work, rather than serving as a “star” vehicle for a performer. The group was incorporated in 1997 and began work its first fundraising production Star Dust: A Tribute to the Music of the 1940s. This was followed by production of the group's first full length show, the musical Working, based on Studs Terkels’ book of the same name with music by a variety of artists including Stephen Schwartz, James Taylor and Micki Grant to name a few. During 4th Wall's early years, the group continued to fine tune its mission and saw both audience growth and critical recognition for its presentations of musicals such as Pippin, Is there life after high school?, Godspell, Falsettos, Violet and A New Brain in addition to many others. The group produced at the Morristown-Beard School in Morristown, NJ. In 2002, 4th Wall was asked by the Bickford Theatre, located in the Morris Museum, to begin producing in its state-of-the-art theatre space. 4th Wall moved and presented musicals such as Songs for a New World, Hair, Dames at Sea and La Cage aux Folles. In the ensuing years, 4th Wall shifted its focus from ensemble pieces to producing lesser known and/or seldom produced musicals. Productions included Bat Boy: The Musical , Big River, Ain’t Misbehavin’, Kiss of the Spider Woman, and Assassins. In the winter of 2006, the group made its current move to be the theatre in residence at the Westminster Arts Center on the campus of Bloomfield. In 2007, 4th Wall began offering stipends to its actors. The group is driven by executive staff members and the board of directors: Gwen Ricks-Spencer-Executive Director, Kate Swan-Artistic Director, Martha Thalheimer-Business Manager, Nik Marmo, Julie Galorenzo and Jasmine Pai. 4th Wall staff and performers come to the theatre with credits from Broadway, Off- Broadway, National and European tours, Regional Theatre and Television. Many aspiring performers have worked with the group and moved on to these arenas as well.  M.I.D. (Musicals-in-Development) Stage Series  Since moving to Westminster, 4th Wall has expanded its mission and season. Under the leadership of former Artistic Director Gregory Allen, the group launched the M.I.D. Stage Series in 2006. The program is designed to present new musical theatre works from emerging composers and writers. The staff and the cast work with the writers throughout the production process (from auditions to production). The show is then mounted in a bare bones production and talk back sessions with the audience conclude each evening's performance. The goal is to create a forum where new and emerging artists can have their work presented in a supportive environment, outside the intense glare of New York as an important and critical development step for the work. The hope is that one day these works will become the main stage productions for other theatres.  Off the Wall Stage Series  In 2007, 4th Wall rolled out its Off the Wall Series which is dedicated to taking 4th Wall's mission of producing lesser known works to a new level. Off the Wall showcases more avant-garde and lesser known musical works. In addition, the group has added plays to its schedule with this series.  Educational programs  4th Wall has developed a partnership with the New Jersey School of Dramatic Arts (“NJSDA”) which serves as the educational wing of our theatre. NJSDA is a comprehensive theater arts training program for the beginning actor to the working professional. Classes are available at all levels for Adults, Teens, and Children and are taught by industry professionals from Theater, TV, and Film. NJSDA offers theater arts training designed in a step by step program which builds on the skills gained in previous levels. NJSDA emphasizes the development of a strong and proven technique. As a partner organization, NJSDA students have the opportunity to intern with 4th Wall and receive specially priced rush tickets to 4th Wall performances. In addition, students are encouraged to audition for 4th Wall.

Similar in plot to that of Idiot's Delight by Robert E.

She achieves her goal with the help of a handsome blond chauffeur and his look-alike, a leader of the revolution. Williams described the play as a first draft in need of polishing when the American Conservatory Theater staged it at the Geary Theater in San Francisco in 1976. The cast included Elizabeth Huddle as the countess, Nicholas Cortland in the dual roles of the chauffeur and revolutionary, and Ray Reinhardt as the count. The character of the Countess was based on Maria Britneva; the title originally included the phrase \\"For Maria Britneva\\".John Lahr, \\"The Lady and Tennessee\\", The New Yorker, December 19, 1994. Stanley Eichelbaum of the San Francisco Examiner called it \\"a boisterous vaudeville-like farce done in the free-wheeling style of the playwright's earlier Camino Real.

Personal life  Born Anna Dorothea Riseng, Skappel was active on stage and in theatrical work in her early teens. During the 1980s, Skappel began working as an international model in Paris, before eventually returning to Oslo and marrying her high-school boyfriend Jon Skappel, a construction engineer. She has two daughters and is currently residing with her family in Ekeberg in Oslo.  Career  In the early 1990s, Skappel joined the Norwegian television channel TVNorge as an entertainer and television host, before switching to TV2, and began her career by heading the Norwegian celebrity and entertainment program God kveld, Norge! non-stop for ten years since 1997. Since hosting the show, she has raised controversy for kissing Lene Nystrøm Rasted, the lead vocalist in the pop-dance group Aqua, and having her breasts felt by Robbie Williams during an interview on the air in Bergen, Norway. Since 1999, she has also hosted the annual award-show Gullruten for the Norwegian TV business. In 2007, Skappel was contracted to star in the Norwegian version of Dancing with the Stars, except it included dancing on ice skates and it was called Isdans, Norwegian for \\"Ice dance\\". She received critical acclaim for her performances, but on 4 May Skappel had an accident when she fell head first onto the ice while training with her partner. She was hospitalized with minor injuries and received bruises across her face, but has since recovered from the accident. Eventually, Skappel finished in fourth place. In 2008, Skappel sparked both fame and controversy when she recorded her first music video, in which she is seen rapping and \\"cursing\\" towards known Norwegian celebrities, and even her own television network, as the video was entitled \\"Fuck TV2\\". The song then became huge a hit, as it entered the official top 20-list at VG within the first week. However, the video itself was censored by TV2 and subsequently uploaded on YouTube onto various channels, where they have altogether garnered about 100,000 viewers. Although Skappel raised controversy over the video, most fans, including most of the celebrities who were \\"cursed\\" at, applauded her rapping. Later that year, Skappel interviewed Gerard Butler regarding the release of RocknRolla, a film written and directed by Guy Ritchie. Since Alexander Rybak won the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest, Skappel has expressed interest in presenting the next contest ceremony, which will be held in Norway in 2010.  In the media  As a result of her career, Dorthe Skappel's personal life has been and is still the subject of much media attention, criticism and controversy. In Norway, Skappel is considered one of the most recognizable celebrities on television and thus she is widely marketed in promotions and commercials on TV2. This is due to her high-profiled status as a Norwegian socialite and sex symbol. Additionally, Norwegian paparazzi has linked Skappel romantically with international celebrities such as Robbie Williams and Gerard Butler while Skappel has repeatedly denied this, describing these relationships as \\"ridiculous\\". Two common themes in Norwegian \\"gossip magazines\\" are Skappel's height and breast measurements. Since 2006 Skappel, along with fellow Norwegian entertainers Tone Damli Aaberge, Pia Tjelta and Mia Gundersen, has fought an ongoing legal battle concerning an online pornography web site, which illegally contains nude photos and images of Skappel, Aaberge and Gundersen among others. The publishing of the images on the web site attracted widespread media attention, but Skappel has since claimed these to be fake and manipulated through digital technology. The site was reportedly operated by Bjørn-Endre Andersen, in addition to a number of similar web pages being operated in his name both domestically and abroad, but thus far neither the Norwegian National Authority for the Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime (Økokrim) or the National Criminal Investigation Service, have concluded a successful investigation, citing the lack of evidence. The pornography scandal was widely covered in Verdens Gang, Dagbladet and Aftenposten, three prominent newspapers in Norway, and included nude photos of dozens of high-profiled celebrities. Skappel has not been successful in removing the images from the website, and continues to claim they are digitally manipulated. In October 2009, Skappel announced she would publish a children's novel and become a writer. This coordinated with her 23-year-old daughter Maria Skappel announcing her pregnancy. On 5 January 2010 TV 2 reported that Maria Skappel gave birth to a daughter, culminating in Dorthe Skappel becoming a grandmother at the age of 47.

The Battle of Chillianwala was fought during the Second Anglo-Sikh War in the nearby villages of Chillianwala and Rasul on 13 January 1849. Before the creation of Pakistan it was home to Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus. During the bloody partition in 1947, Sikhs and Hindus migrated to India and Muslim refugees (Muhajirs) coming from India were given the abandoned properties left behind by the Sikhs. Before 1960 people of Amra Kalan largely depended on agriculture. Small land holdings and economic conditions forced people to look for alternatives. From the early 1960s, many inhabitants started migrating to European countries; mainly the United Kingdom, Greece, Holland, Denmark and Norway, to the Middle East in the 70s and later to USA, Spain and Italy from the 90s onward. This has brought about an improvement in the economic conditions for majority of the population with better living conditions for many in the village.  Infrastructure  Amra Kalan is in two parts: the main village and the Adda (bus stop). Over the years the Adda has developed into a place of commercial and industrial activity. Amra Kalan is growing into a small town: It has three government schools, hospital, a telephone exchange, a bank, a post office, two graveyards and two self-funded community centres. The streets are paved and sewerage channels are open but lined. The village is surrounded by fields that are used to harvest rice and wheat in respective seasons.  Transport  Amra Kalan has seventy Rickshaws providing convenient transport to neighbouring villages and to Dinga Town that is approximately 3 miles from the village. There are some tangas (single horse carriages) linking the village and the Adda but their number is on the decline. The Adda provides two taxi bases.  Religion  The village is home to sunni, Sufi and shia Muslims. There are eleven mosques, four holy shrines and one imam bargah. in Amra Kalan there is a shrine of Allama Maulana Molvi Allah Deen and his son Allama Muhammad Azeem ur Rehman.

It is located in Butte Valley Township along North Dakota Highway 30. Harlow is assigned Zip code 58346, which it shares with neighboring Leeds.Zip Code Lookup History Harlow was established in 1912 along the Soo Line Railroad. The post office was established in 1914 and was later assigned the zipcode 58340.U.S. Postal Service, Find a Postmaster The post office closed in 1984. The town's population was estimated as high as 100 during its development, but it never incorporated as a city. Alternative suggestions for the origin of the town's name are either after an official with the railroad or after the Harlow Old Fort House in Plymouth, Massachusetts. The original homesteader was Louis Larsen Ulvestead in 1896. Local resident Ole Ronning (1905-2005), lived on the homestead until moving to Devils Lake in 2000. Ole and his wife, Alma, were known for publishing a comprehensive history of Harlow and the surrounding township in the 1960s. Geography Harlow lies along North Dakota Highway 30 between the cities of York and Maddock. Demographics Butte Valley Township, in which Harlow is located, showed a population of 87 as of the 2000 Census. As an unincorporated community, the United States Census Bureau does not track total population numbers for Harlow. However, according to census block data, Harlow includes blocks 1275, 1276, and 1282 through 1287 within census tract 9565, block group 1. These blocks had a combined population of 21 during the 2000 Census.

It was released on a cassette with the Amstrad version on one side and the Spectrum version on the other, this scheme being referred to as \\"Flippy\\". The game used the same engine as Viz Design's (consisting of Steve Howard and Paul Smith) other game Frankenstein Junior which was released by Codemasters in the same year. The game was released two years late (and largely unfinished) and was as a budget title, as intended publisher Ariolasoft went bankrupt (being released by Mastertronic). It was also released in Spain by Dro Soft. The game is set in London and the plot is to kill each of eight members of an aristocratic family who put a curse on the main character, resulting in his daily transformation into a werewolf. Gameplay The game is played from a side-on 45-degree view, letting the player not only move left and right, but up and down. The character can also jump. The player starts off as a human who must roam the streets of London (including the London Underground and Hyde Park), and pick up items which will help the player in certain tasks. When the timer hits midnight, the player character transforms into a werewolf. The player must then track down each of the 8 enemy characters and kill, and optionally, eat their bodies, while avoiding being shot or captured by the police. The game involved more strategy elements than the traditional 8-bit platform game, as the game changed mechanics and difficulty in response to the player's actions. For example, the more people that are attacked by the werewolf, the more active the police become. The Hyde Park location is locked during the night, and a ticket is needed to enter the subway (although rush gate can be done). When the Werewolf is sent to prison when 'touched' by a police officer with handcuffs. After transforms back to a human, the player is released or the player can escape by finding a crowbar to escape through the sewers (a torch is needed to see in the dark). Eating family members and NPC gives extra health, but being shot results in a constant health drop (in the form of a blood-bag icon). Finding bandages can stem the blood flow. If the blood-bag reaches empty, the game is over. Audiovisual production The sound in the game consists of basic sound effects in a single sound channel including footsteps, the dripping of blood, and a crunching sound when the werewolf mauls its victims. While the Spectrum version featured only a simple beeper tune on the title screen, there were three pieces of two channel music on the Amstrad CPC and C64 versions; one for the menu, and two for the human/werewolf stages. The music seamlessly blended with each other when the character morphed between stages. The CPC version of the game used 'Mode 0' resolution (160 x 200) and 16 colours, while the Spectrum used the standard 256×192 resolution. The CPC had up to eight characters (including the player character) on screen at any one time, the Spectrum could have up to five (including the player character) and the C64 could have up to four. The sprites and backgrounds on the Spectrum were completely different from those in the other versions.

In many countries, both in the Global South and in a number of Western countries, breastfeeding babies in open view of the general public is common and generally not regarded as an issue. In many parts of the world including Australia, some parts of the United States and Europe, along with some countries in Asia, women have an explicit legal right to nurse in public and in the workplace. Even though the practice may be legal or socially accepted, some mothers may nevertheless be reluctant to expose a breast in public to breastfeed due to actual or potential objections by other people, negative comments, or harassment. It is estimated that around 63% of mothers across the world have publicly breast- fed. The media have reported a number of incidents in which workers or members of the public have objected to or forbidden women breastfeeding. Some mothers avoid the negative attention and choose to move to another location. But some mothers have protested their treatment, and have taken legal action or engaged in protests. Protests have included a public boycott of the offender's business, organizing a \\"nurse-in\\" or a breastfeeding flash mob, in which groups of nursing mothers gather at the location where the complaint originated and nursed their babies at the same time. In response, some companies have apologised and agreed to train their employees.  Attitudes by country and continent  Africa = Kabala, Sierra Leone in West Africa nurses outdoors. In many areas of Africa breastfeeding in public is the norm. Babies are commonly carried on a mother's back in a length of cloth and merely moved to the front for feeding. The nursing mother may shield the view of the baby nursing, but generally no attempt is made to hide the baby and the mother's breast from view. When a baby is seen crying in public it is assumed that the woman with the infant is not the child's mother, since it is normally thought that she would feed the infant if she were the mother.  Morocco  Public breastfeeding is legal and widely accepted.  Sierra Leone  Sierra Leone has the highest infant mortality rate in the world. During a goodwill trip to the country, actress Salma Hayek breastfed on camera a hungry week-old infant whose mother could not produce milk. She said she did it to reduce the stigma associated with breastfeeding and to encourage infant nutrition. = Asia = Indonesian woman breastfeeding in public.  China  Breastfeeding in public in China has traditionally been uncontroversial, and objection had been unheard of until 2010s. The recent few instances of objection are apparently an effect of magnification of the social media. In Shanghai, breastfeeding in public is considered embarrassing by some, but it is also accepted by many. There have been calls for the establishment of babycare facilities in public places.  India  India has no legal statute dealing with breastfeeding. Prevalence and social acceptance vary from region to region. In rural India it is completely acceptable. Breastfeeding in public is not a norm in higher sections of society, but is quite common in the lower economic sections.  Malaysia  Discreet breastfeeding in public is accepted in Malaysia.  Nepal  Nepal has no laws about public breastfeeding. Public breastfeeding is common and widely accepted. It is not uncommon to see mothers breastfeeding their babies in public places such as buses, parks, restaurants, hospitals etc. in Nepal. In Nepalese society, breastfeeding a child is considered a must for the mothers. Mothers who do not or are unable to breastfeed their child are considered to be 'bokshi' – 'witch', and much social stigma is attached to it.  Philippines  In the Philippines, breastfeeding is protected by various laws, such as the Expanded Breastfeeding Promotion Act of 2009 and the Milk Code of the Philippines (Executive Order 51). Mothers are allowed to breastfeed in public. Employers are required to allow lactating employees breaks to breastfeed or express breastmilk. The law also states that the intervals should not be less than a total of forty (40) minutes for every eight (8) hour working period. Offices, public establishments such as malls and schools, and government institutions are required to establish lactation stations separate from the bathroom, where mothers can breastfeed their babies or express milk. The Milk Code prohibits the advertising of infant formula or bottle teats for infants under two years old.  Saudi Arabia  Even though women can not show any part of their body in public, breastfeeding is an exception. It is common for women to breastfeed in malls and parks, and it is acceptable among the people in Saudi Arabia.  Taiwan  Since November 2010 the Public Breastfeeding Act has safeguarded the right to breastfeed in public, while lactation rooms are set up to deal with privacy and to provide access to hot water and power supplies, with fines against interfering with a mother's right to breastfeed. After evicting a breastfeeding mother from the National Palace Museum on 18 July 2012 and enraging many Taiwanese website users, the supposedly offending employee and her employer were both fined 6000 new Taiwan dollars (about 200 United States dollars), said the Department of Health, Taipei City Government (), but the Museum would appeal. = Europe = Woman nursing her infant at pro-breastfeeding conference in Spain  Czech Republic  Although public breastfeeding is often practised and is not illegal, some people disapprove of it.  France  Public breastfeeding is legal and widely accepted.  Germany  While public breastfeeding is widely accepted, especially since the Movement of 1968 when public \\"Nurse-Ins\\" () were common, there is no legislation that specifically addresses breastfeeding in public. Paragraph 2 Article 6 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany provides that \\"the care and upbringing of children as the natural right of parents\\" while paragraph 4 \\"entitles every mother to the protection and care of the community\\".  Iceland  Public breastfeeding is widespread and uncontroversial.  Italy  In Italy, public breastfeeding is legal and accepted by many. In Italy many mothers do not comply with breastfeeding recommendations. The promotion and support of breastfeeding is still necessary in Italy and still needs to be monitored with representative data. Actions should aim at empowering women, reducing social inequalities and improving practices in hospitals and maternal care services which encourage breastfeeding.Lauria, L., Spinelli, A., & Grandolfo, M. (2016). Prevalence of breastfeeding in Italy: a population based follow-up study. Annali Dell’istituto Superiore Di Sanita, 52(3), 457–461. https://doi.org/10.4415/ANN_16_03_18  Ireland  In the Republic of Ireland, breastfeeding wherever necessary is protected by law under the Equal Status Act 2000, which protects people from discrimination and harassment (including sexual harassment). Although breastfeeding is not directly mentioned, protection for breastfeeding in public is covered by the Act on gender grounds. As a result, it is an offence to ask a breastfeeding woman to stop, move somewhere else or cover up, for example. While this gives a legally protected right to breastfeed anywhere that it becomes necessary, Ireland has one of the lowest rates of breastfeeding in the world.  Netherlands  Public breastfeeding is common and widely socially accepted. There are no laws against public breastfeeding. Dutch law states that when an employee wishes to breastfeed her baby the employer must provide, for the first nine months after the birth, a suitable nursing room and allow for 25% of work time to be spent on feeding the baby or pumping while on pay. After the first nine months the employer is still required to assure conditions for breastfeeding are met (like timely breaks, nursing rooms, safe environment, etc.) but does not have to pay anymore for the time spent on breastfeeding or pumping.  Norway  Public breastfeeding is widespread and uncontroversial.  Poland  Public breastfeeding is widespread and uncontroversial.  Spain  Public breastfeeding is legal and widely accepted.  United Kingdom  Breastfeeding in public (restaurants, cafes, libraries etc.) is protected under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 under the provision of goods, facilities and services section. If the child is under six months old, the mother has additional protection under a 2008 amendment to the act which protects maternity rights. This is superseded by the Equality Act 2010 which clarifies that a business must not discriminate against a woman who is breastfeeding a child of any age in a public place.Equality Act 2010: What do I need to know? Her companion(s) are also protected by this act. A 2004 UK Department of Health survey found that 84% (about five out of six people) find breastfeeding in public acceptable if done discreetly; however, 67% (two out of three) of mothers were worried about general opinion being against public breastfeeding. To combat these fears in Scotland, the Scottish Parliament passed legislation safeguarding the freedom of women to breastfeed in public in 2005. The legislation allows for fines of up to £2500 for preventing breastfeeding of a child up to the age of two years in public places.  Vatican City  In 2014 during a ceremony commemorating the baptism of Jesus, Pope Francis voiced his support for mothers breastfeeding their children in public spaces, including churches. On 9 January 2017 he reiterated his support for public breastfeeding. = North America = Mirel Yolotzin García Bazán breastfeeding her son at the Congress of the Union, Mexico City, 2016  Canada  In Canada, Section 28 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms gives equal rights and freedoms to men and women, without explicitly mentioning breastfeeding. Both British Columbia and Ontario have included protections against discrimination due to breastfeeding in their provincial Human Rights Codes. In both provinces, discrimination due to breastfeeding is included in existing protections against discrimination based on sex. INFACT Canada (Infant Feeding Action Coalition) is a national non-governmental organization that aims to protect infant and young child health as well as maternal well- being through the promotion and support of breastfeeding and optimal infant feeding practices. It is an organization that provides support and education for Canadian mothers. A woman asked in 2009 at a shop by an employee to stop breastfeeding publicly, supported by a manager, later received an apology and acknowledgement of customers' right to breastfeed. A worker at the YMCA in St. John's told a breastfeeding mother to leave the premises. The mother was feeding her seven-month-old daughter in a private change room, which required a monthly fee. YMCA CEO Jason Brown later apologized, stating \\"This situation has caused us to reflect and review, and certainly we see no reason why there should be a restriction to women breastfeed their babies in the adult-only change room.\\" = Inuit people = Inuit children have the lowest breastfeeding rates amongst Canadian Aboriginal populations, far lower than the Canadian average. According to a 2006 statistics report, 24% of Inuit children have never been breastfed. There have been health promotion programs created in order to increase the knowledge of the benefits of breastfeeding amongst Inuit women.  United States  Woman in center is feeding her baby in a tent city erected in 1920 by the Red Cross in St. Louis, Missouri, so city families could get away from the August heat. (Drawing by Marguerite Martyn of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.) A number of issues constrain mothers from breastfeeding in public in the United States. In 2011 the US Surgeon General issued a plea to promote breastfeeding and stated in it: \\"Although focusing on the sexuality of female breasts is common on the mass media, visual images of breastfeeding are rare, and a mother may never have seen a woman breastfeeding\\". Another issue, especially in extended breastfeeding, is that US medical providers are not well-trained in supporting breastfeeding mothers. In a survey of medical professionals published in 2012, including physicians, midwives, residents, and nursing students, only 57.8% felt that breastfeeding over 1 year of age was normal. The recommendations for breastfeeding are until at least one year, yet in 2016 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that only 51.8% of infants were breastfed at six months and 30.7% of infants were being breastfed at one year old. In a 2004 survey conducted by the American Dietetic Association, 43% of the 3,719 respondents believed women ought to have the right to breast-feed in public. In spite of this, women breastfeeding in public have met with social resistance and even arrest. In some public places and workplaces, rooms for mothers to nurse in private have been designated. U.S. legislation governing breastfeeding varies from state to state and a limited federal law only applies to federal government premises. A United States House of Representatives appropriations bill (HR 2490) contained an amendment specifically permitting breastfeeding and was signed into law on September 29, 1999. It stipulated that no government funds may be used to enforce any prohibition on women breastfeeding their children in federal buildings or on federal property. Further, a federal law also enacted in 1999 specifically provides that \\"a woman may breastfeed her child at any location in a federal building or on federal property, if the woman and her child are otherwise authorized to be present at the location.\\" section 647. Section 4207 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act amended the Fair Labor Standards Act and required employers to provide a reasonable break time for an employee to breastfeed her child if it is less than one year old.Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act . Government Printing Office. Page 459. The employee must be allowed to breastfeed in a private place, other than a bathroom. The employer is not required to pay the employee during the break time. Employers with fewer than 50 employees are not required to comply with the law if doing so would impose an undue hardship to the employer based on its size, finances, nature, or structure of its business. A number of incidents of harassment of nursing mothers that gained media attention prompted a number of U.S. states to act. These actions included viral videos of people harassing breastfeeding mothers in public, protests, and social media campaigns. A particular incident with a Target employee harassing a breastfeeding mother helped to launch a new trend with corporations making breastfeeding accepted in their stores. As of July 2018, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the Virgin Islands have passed legislation that explicitly allows women to breastfeed in public. Further, at least 29 states, the District of Columbia, and the Virgin Islands exempt them from prosecution for public indecency or indecent exposure for doing so. = Oceania = Australia  Section 7AA of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 specifically prohibits discrimination against a woman on account of her breastfeeding.Sex Discrimination Act 1984, s.7AA . The prohibition also applies to a public or semi-public place. State and Territory laws differ, but it is generally illegal to discriminate against women breastfeeding in a public place as a protected attribute in five jurisdictions and by proxy from other existing legislation in the other jurisdictions. The Australian Breastfeeding Association was founded in Melbourne, Victoria in 1964 as the Nursing Mothers' Association, and together with many health professionals, encourages and assists mothers to breastfeed their babies, if necessary also in a public place. In February 2003, Kirstie Marshall, member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, was ejected from Parliament for breastfeeding her 11-day-old baby on the basis that the baby was \\"a stranger\\" not entitled to be in the Chamber. As a result, a special room was set up for use by nursing mothers. A 2007 House of Representatives Committee on Health and Ageing report into breastfeeding recommended that Parliament House seek formal accreditation from the Australian Breastfeeding Association as a breastfeeding-friendly workplace. In March 2008 the Presiding Officers agreed to the recommendation and work commenced to provide facilities to assist breastfeeding mothers at Parliament House. Two small rooms were made available, one on each side of Parliament House, for members of parliament and other building occupants to breastfeed or express milk. Certificates of accreditation were provided in a ceremony at the parliament on 17 October 2008.  New Zealand  Breastfeeding is encouraged and public breastfeeding is common. In fact, bottle feeding has been so widely discouraged that public bottle feeding may make a mother feel more uncomfortable than public breastfeeding. Many shopping centers provide \\"parent's rooms\\" where mothers may change and feed their infants in comfort. = South America = A woman breastfeeding at a carnival in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 2017 In most areas of South America breastfeeding is the norm and public breastfeeding is common in buses, parks, malls, etc. It is less common to see public bottle feeding than breastfeeding. While women are seldom seen nursing in upscale restaurants or on the streets of large cities, nursing is encouraged and thought of as normal and a nursing mother's breasts are not viewed as sexual objects.  Recent controversies  Breastfeeding at work in Canada = Under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms women are protected against discrimination, but Canada was one of the only countries that did not have paid breastfeeding breaks. Although over 26% of mothers breastfeed, many of them are forced to stop due to work restrictions. = Public breastfeeding in the U.S. = There have been incidents of owners of premises, or people present, objecting to or forbidding breastfeeding. In some cases the mothers have left. In other cases, where a law guaranteeing the right to breastfeed has been broken, legal action has been taken. Some companies have even apologised afterward. One woman who was not allowed to breastfeed despite showing the Kentucky law that allows her the right, left but later organized several \\"nurse-in\\" protests in front of the restaurant and other public places. In June 2007, Brooke Ryan was dining in a booth at the rear of an Applebee's restaurant when she began to breastfeed her seven-month- old son. Although she attempted to be discreet, another patron complained to the manager about indecent exposure. Both a waitress and the manager asked her to cover up. She handed him a copy of the Kentucky law that permitted public breastfeeding, but he would not relent. She opted to feed her son in her car, and later organized \\"nurse-out\\" protests in front of the restaurant and other public locations. As of 2018, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the Virgin Islands have laws protecting breastfeeding in public. In 2008 a woman in New Orleans put a tent over her truck at a street festival so she could nurse her daughter privately. She was cited by police for an \\"unauthorized booth\\" and removed from the street festival.\\"Mom's Breastaurant\\", Catherine P. Businelle, Mothering, January/February 2008, p. 62\\"Milpitas woman creates retreat for nursing moms\\", Wes Bowers, Milpitas Post, August 14, 2008, p. 38 = Babytalk magazine cover = In 2006, the editors of U.S. Babytalk magazine received many complaints from readers after the cover of the August issue depicted a baby nursing at a bare breast. Even though the model's nipple was not shown, readers—many of them mothers—wrote that the image was \\"gross\\". In a follow-up poll, one-quarter of 4,000 readers who responded thought the cover was negative. Babytalk editor Susan Kane commented, \\"There's a huge puritanical streak in Americans.\\" = Barbara Walters = In 2005 U.S. television presenter Barbara Walters remarked on her talk show The View that she felt uncomfortable sitting next to a breastfeeding mother during a flight. Her comments upset some viewers who began organizing protests over the internet. A group of about 200 mothers staged a public \\"nurse-in\\" where they breastfed their babies outside ABC's headquarters in New York. = Target store protest = In December, 2011, Michelle Hickman was breastfeeding her infant at the back of a Target store in Houston, Texas. Although covered, she was asked by two employees to move to a fitting room. Hickman said one of the employees told her, \\"You can get a ticket and be reported for indecent exposure.\\" She reported the harassment on Facebook, and in response a number of mothers organized public \\"nurse-ins\\" at Target stores across the United States in cities including Houston, Knoxville, and Decatur, Illinois. Trace Gallagher on FoxNews reported on the protest, and female host of America Live Megyn Kelly commented, \\"You know, I got a lot of thoughts on this, Trace.\\" She explained, \\"Let me just put it this way: I used to feel a lot differently before I had babies and you're breastfeeding; they need to be fed and then sometimes they don't like the cover. And before you know it, you're Megyn Kelly and you’re showing your breasts to a whole plane.\\" = Claridge's hotel = In 2014 a waiter at Claridge's hotel in Mayfair, London asked Louise Burns to breastfeed under a cloth. Burns was told that it was hotel policy for mothers to cover up while breastfeeding. UK politician and broadcaster Nigel Farage spoke out in support of the hotel's right to have such a policy but the Prime Minister's office at 10 Downing Street said it was \\"totally unacceptable for any women to be made to feel uncomfortable when breastfeeding in public\\". A group of about 25 mothers held a protest against the policy by breastfeeding outside the hotel. Claridge's subsequently denied that asking breastfeeding mothers to cover up was hotel policy and said that breastfeeding mothers were welcome at the hotel, adding: \\"all we ask is that mothers are discreet towards other guests\\". = Breastfeeding in uniform in the US military = In May 2012, two Air Force National Guard service members stationed at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington, participated in a breastfeeding awareness campaign hosted by the Mom2Mom of Fairchild Breastfeeding Support Group. Photographer Brynja Sigurdardottir, also a military spouse, staged and photographed Terran Echegoyen-McCabe and Christina Luna breastfeeding in uniform. Crystal Scott, the founder of Mom2Mom, said people thought the photograph was a disgrace to the uniform and compared their actions to defecating or urinating in uniform. Some military personnel felt that it was impossible for a woman to maintain a professional military bearing while nursing in uniform. But some active-duty veteran military members who are also mothers were more supportive, suggesting that the women enhanced the prestige of the military. The photographs quickly went viral and were shared worldwide. To help reduce the controversy, Sigurdardottir removed the photos from her website and Facebook fan page. Her intention was to raise awareness and support for women who breastfeed, inside and outside of the military. When the controversy arose, the message was quickly lost among critics. While the U.S. Air Force did not endorse the pictures, their commanding officer gave the women permission to be photographed in uniform while breastfeeding. The U.S. military protects women in uniform by allowing them to defer deployments for 4 to 12 months after childbirth for breastfeeding purposes. Breastfeeding service members are provided regular breaks to breastfeed or pump while on duty, and are provided with a comfortable and private place to do so. = Facebook controversy = Facebook has been criticized for removing photos of mothers breastfeeding their children, citing offensive content in violation of the Facebook Terms of Service. Facebook claimed that these photos violated their decency code by showing an exposed breast, even when the baby covered the nipple. This action was described as hypocritical, since Facebook took several days to respond to calls to deactivate a paid advertisement for a dating service that used a photo of a topless model. The breastfeeding photos controversy continued following public protests and the growth in the online membership in the Facebook group titled \\"Hey, Facebook, breastfeeding is not obscene! (Official petition to Facebook).\\" In December 2011 Facebook removed photos of mothers breastfeeding and, after public criticism, restored them. The company said it had removed the photos because they violated the pornographic rules in the company's terms and conditions. During February, 2012, the company once again removed photos of mothers breastfeeding. Founders of a Facebook group \\"Respect the Breast\\" reported that \\"women say they are tired of people lashing out at what is natural and what they believe is healthy for their children.\\"  See also  * Child's Right to Nurse Act * History and culture of breastfeeding * International Breastfeeding Symbol * Simple living * Women's Equality Day  References  Further reading  * * – A collection of notes about attitudes towards public breastfeeding in different countries around the world.  * * Category:Breastfeeding Category:Breastfeeding advocacy Category:Nudity ","title":"Breastfeeding in public"},{"id":"20893173","text":"Baharwal, also spelt Barwal, is a town and union council of Gujrat District, in the Punjab province of Pakistan.Tehsils & Unions in the District of Gujrat - Government of Pakistan It is part of Kharian Tehsil and is located at 32°46'0N 73°56'0E with an altitude of 264 metres (869 feet).

Located 1.9 miles to the north-east of Debenham, in 2005 its population was 170. A parish in the Hundreds of Suffolk of Loes. The name Kenton comes from the Old English for ‘Kingly’, or ‘Royal’ and can trace its origins back to before the Norman conquest. Not to be confused by Kenton, a place partly in the London Borough of Harrow and partly in the London Borough of Brent, and Kenton, a place in Devon. Between 1908 and 1952 the village was served by the Mid-Suffolk Light Railway, on which it had a station with a platform, which was located over 0.6 miles south. The station had a small building made externally of corrugated iron and internally of match-boarding. Kenton station was halfway between Laxfield and Haughley on the branch line. Kenton Hall (around 1868) resides nearby about half a mile south-west from the church. Grass drying plant (operated by Eastern Counties Farmers) was just behind the old station. Present day All Saints (Church OS grid TM 191 659) is on the unclassified road between Occold and Earl Soham and Church Lane with Church Close nearby. It has a very fine brick built south aisle and chapel, flush with the porch and with its own entrance from it. It was built as a chantry chapel for the Garneys family in 1524, and was dedicated to St John. The south aisle is now furnished and dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, rather than to St John. It once contained an excellent, intricate Garneys brass, contemporary with the chapel, which Cautley and Arthur Mee both saw in the 1930s. Kenton Post Office (on Eye Road IP14 6JW) now closed - was a couple of hundred yards north of Church Lane/Close. There are several farms in the area, Sycamore Farm (a few hundred metres north of the church), Moat Farm (an apple orchard a few hundred yards west of the church), and another near to the Hall. Kenton Lodge is to the extreme south-east of the village.

It was responsible for covert intelligence collection operations in Cambodia. History Detachment B-57 arrived in South Vietnam in June 1967. On 26 February 1968 it was moved from Saigon to Nha Trang and it received the designation Project GAMMA on 1 April 1968, in conjunction with other special forces units such as Project DELTA (Detachment B-52) and Project SIGMA (Detachment B-56), both responsible for Special Recon. Members of the detachment operated from nine sites under the cover of civil affairs and psychological operations offices.Stanton (1988), p. 196 Project Gamma was responsible for obtaining intelligence on Cambodian support for the activities of both regular and irregular units of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN), as well as irregular camps in Cambodia. The top intelligence officer on General Abrams' staff stated in October 1968 that Project GAMMA was providing 65 percent of the known data on PAVN base camps and strengths in Cambodia, as well as 75 percent of the same data on South Vietnam.Seals, Bob (2007) The \\"Green Beret Affair\\": A Brief Introduction, militaryhistoryonline.com http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/20thCentury/articles/greenberets.aspx According to historian Shelby Stanton, by early 1969 Detachment B-57 \\"had developed into the finest and most productive intelligence-collection operation the United States had in Southeast Asia\\". Stanton attributes this success to the South Vietnamese authorities not being aware of operations conducted by the detachment's indigenous agents. One source claims GAMMA was responsible for intelligence operations against Prince Norodom Sihanouk.Hersh, Seymour M.,The Price of Power, Kissinger in the Nixon White House, Summit Books, 1983, paper, Cambodia: The Coup p175; =Capture, interrogation, and killing of Chu Van Thai Khac= In early 1969 some of Detachment B-57's sources of information started to disappear. This led the detachment's leadership to conclude that its intelligence agents had been compromised. In the spring of 1969, a MACV-SOG reconnaissance team operating in Cambodia captured photos showing Chu Van Thai Khac (AKA Thai Khac ChuyenThe Green Beret Affair: A Factual Review by Terry McIntoshhttp://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/vietnam/articles/thegreenberetaffair.aspx), a South Vietnamese GAMMA agent, meeting with North Vietnamese intelligence officers. Chuyen was subsequently arrested and interrogated for ten days, with polygraph tests indicating that he had compromised security arrangements and was working with the Viet Cong. Various ways of dealing with Chuyen were discussed within Detachment B-57, including possibly killing him. While the 5th Special Forces Group's executive officer strongly opposed killing Chuyen, the detachment's commander and operations officer met with the CIA headquarters in Saigon who suggested that \\"elimination ... might be the best course of action\\".Stanton (1988), p. 197 On 20 June 1969, three officers assigned to Project GAMMA drugged Chuyen, took him out on a boat into Nha Trang Bay, shot him twice in the head and dumped his body into the South China Sea. A cover story claiming that Chuyen had been sent on a one-way mission as a test of his loyalty was later approved by the 5th Special Forces Group's commander, Colonel Robert B. Rheault.Stanton (1988), pp. 197–198 Later, Sergeant Alvin Smith, Chuyen's former handler, became concerned for his safety and sought sanctuary with the CIA in Nha Trang, where he revealed that Chuyen had been killed. General Abrams heard of the matter and ordered the arrest of Smith and seven involved officers, including Rheault.Stanton (1988), p. 198 The case went to trial and was covered extensively by the media, becoming known as the ' and led to popular knowledge of the term \\"terminate with extreme prejudice\\" as a euphemism for \\"execute\\". The Army defense lawyers for the eight soldiers called General Abrams and CIA officials to the witness stand. Both declined to get involved in the proceedings and testify. Finally in September 1969, Secretary of the Army Stanley Resor announced to all that all charges would be dropped against the eight soldiers since the CIA, in the interests of national security, had refused to make its personnel available as witnesses, therefore making any manner of a fair trial impossible. Project GAMMA was deactivated on 31 March 1970. An official Army history of the Green Berets, published after the Vietnam War, does not mention Project GAMMA or Detachment B-57. Although the Pentagon has declassified much material about Green Beret crossborder operations inside Laos and Cambodia, nothing on Project GAMMA has been made available. Organization Project Gamma used members of the Khmer Serei and the Khmer Kampuchean Krom in its activities inside Cambodia. It consisted of five collection teams supervising 13 nets with 98 indigenous agents.

The botija is a potbellied earthenware jug or jar with two openings and was used in the early son sextetos in Cuba as a bass instrument. Origin The botija was used to hold kerosene brought from Spain. Botijas were then used to hide money underground and were buried to prevent humidity from reaching the floors. Later, botijas were dug up and used as musical instruments in the late 19th century in the Caribbean island of Cuba. Use in Cuban son Cuban son originated in eastern Cuba in the late 19th century. The music's defining characteristic was a pulsing or anticipated bass that falls between the downbeat, leading to the creation of many bass instruments including the botija. Other instruments included a marímbula, serrucho, contrabajo and bajo. Other bass instruments were used according to the size of the musical arrangement or timbre of the bass instrument needed. The marímbula, for example, was used mainly for smaller ensembles because it was not easily heard, whereas the bajo, an electrical bass, could be easily projected and heard over many other instruments. The botijas contained two openings, one at the top and one of the side, and were blown into to create bass notes. To crate specific pitches, they were filled to specific levels with water. Another technique includes inserting a reed into the opening while the player blows into the reed. Use of the botija throughout parts of Cuba ended after the early 20th century and was replaced by the double bass.Carpentier, Alejo 2001 [1946]. Music in Cuba. Minneapolis MN.

The show uses maps as visual support. Previous hosts include the geographer and geo- politician Jean-Christophe Victor, son of the explorer Paul-Emile Victor. The content of the show is jointly prepared by Jean-Christophe Victor and the \\"Laboratoire d'études politiques et d'analyses cartographiques\\" (Laboratory for Political Studies and Map analysis), known as LEPAC, and of which he is the founder and main shareholder. Programming and format The show was first aired from 1990 to 1992, on La Sept until it stopped broadcasting, and has been on air since 1992 on the Franco-German channel Arte. The show is broadcast every Saturday at 20h00 (Paris local time, UTC+1) and rebroadcast several times a week. The format of the show has changed little since the first episode. However, the episode length expanded from 7 to 11 minutes. The transition from 11 to 26 minutes referred to by Jean-Christophe Victor in 2002 was abandoned. Structure of the show In general, the show runs as follows: *Generic top *Introduction – Jean-Christophe Victor introduces the topic of the show on a neutral background *Development – maps, animations and sometimes pictures while Jean-Christophe Victor talks. *Conclusion – Jean-Christophe Victor concludes the program on a neutral point of view *Bibliography of books which served as sources and / or may give the viewer further insight into the topic *End Credits Maps and visualization methods Topographic maps are based on the Ordnance Survey Oxford Cartographers. The most commonly used Map projection is that of Eckert (the Pseudo-cylindrical projection). The show also uses satellite imagery from Google Earth and the first use was in the episode named: \\"Nigeria, rich state poor country.\\" Program production cycle The Laboratoire d'études politiques et d'analyses cartographiques (LEPAC) produces about forty episodes a year for the channel Arte. The subjects for most episodes are decided a year in advance to allow time for production. This delay in the selection of themes allows a certain hindsight regarding the chosen topic. However, on occasion, the topic of an episode is more closely related to current events. For example, the episode \\"Tsunami, a natural phenomenon\\" aired just three months after the events in South-East Asia.. The subjects of the show Of the 300 programs (from March 2001 to May 2008), 210 (70%) have a geographical approach and 84 (28%) have a thematic approach. 6 issues remain unclassifiable: introspective (ex: \\"La Methode le Dessous des Cartes\\") or dreamers (ex: \\"A journey with Corto Maltese, Turkey to Samarkand\\"). For information and the geographical most commonly accepted: *Africa (29) *Latin America (21) *Anglo-Saxon America (12) *Europe (53) *Polar worlds (11) *Central Asia (10) *East Asia (35) *Middle East (36) *Oceania (1) Anecdote: The issue of 29 March 2000, for the week of April 1, is a parody of the show itself. The producing team of the show made what could be the episode of 1 April 3000 by offering a retrospective view of the past thousand years. The methods and objectives of the programme In a special 10th birthday episode named \\"La méthode du Dessous des Cartes\\", the aims of the show were outlined: *Give way to Geography *Give meaning through History *Cross disciplines *Everything is connected *Avoid Ethnocentrism *Giving a try at Future studies *Take a stand The main, oft repeated aim of the show is \\"to understand rather than to inform.\\" Positions The main positions of the show and its sponsors are as follows: in favor of Human rights, Sustainable development, and the Proposals for a Palestinian state, and against the concepts of Ethnic cleansing, Just War and The Clash of Civilizations (as suggested for example by Samuel P.

It was the home of Hinckley United, an English football club from the town, until it was dissolved in October 2013. The main stadium is now the home of Leicester Road Football Club and the Leicester Falcons American football team. The main football stadium was renamed Leicester Road Stadium on 6 June 2013. The site covers and includes three full size pitches, two three-quarter size pitches, three half size pitches and a full size, all-weather floodlit 3G rubber crumb surface pitch. It is named in honour of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester. The flagship of the complex is the Leicester Road Stadium, a 4,329 capacity purpose-built football ground, comprising a gymnasium, sports injury clinic and a social club. The Stadium opened in March 2005 when Stalybridge Celtic were the first team to play Hinckley United on the ground, in front of a crowd of over 2000. Stadium Sponsorship When the Stadium opened in 2005 it was known as the Marston's Stadium, following a sponsorship deal between Hinckley United and Marston's Brewery. The Brewery paid what Regional Sales Manager Bob Leatherland called a 'substantial six figure sum' to secure the naming rights with the money paid out at £25,000 per year over a ten-year period. However, the brewery altered its sponsorship strategy, moving mainly into the cricket Twenty20 competition, and the deal ended early in a mutual agreement between the brewery and football club at the end of December 2008. In January 2009 the club announced a stadium sponsorship deal with the Greene King Brewery and the stadium was renamed the Greene King Stadium. The sponsorship deal with Greene King Brewery ran out at the end of the 2012-2013 season, as confirmed by Chairman Mike Sutton. The stadium name has not been sponsored since and is simply referred to now as Leicester Road Stadium. Stands *The Main Stand - The Main Stand holds 630 covered seats. The complex houses the changing rooms, gymnasium, lounge, boardroom and offices of the football club. VP's Club Bar and the Sponsors' Lounge are located at the top of the Main Stand, overlooking the pitch. *The East Terrace - The East Terrace Stand holds 970 covered seats. *The Tom Powers Stand - The Tom Powers Stand is covered standing room with a capacity of 1095. It is named by the landowner who originally sold the land to Hinckley United, enabling them to build the stadium. the Tom Powers Stand *The West Stand - Currently the West Side is hard standing for 586 spectators. Plans to convert the stand into a 400-seat covered end with changing rooms for the Juniors and an all-weather pitch await finance as of January 2009. The changing rooms have been completed and the next phase will be to cover and seat the hard standing area. The stadium has provision for segregated seating of away stands with 80 seats on the Main Stand and 850 places on the West Stand. The Away Turnstiles are only operable when segregation is in place. Other Uses the East Stand Leicester City reserves have used the De Montfort Park Stadium for their home games in 2006, 2007 and 2008. Aston Villa reserves used Greene King Stadium for their home games in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. The Greene King Stadium is used by the Leicestershire FA for finals of their regional competitions. It staged International Youth games in 2006. England U19s used the facilities for training in 2006 ahead of a match against the Czech Republic at Northampton's Sixfields Stadium. In April 2007, April 2008 and April 2010 the Stadium was used by the English FA as a semi final venue for the National FA Sunday Cup. Aston Villa Reserves use the stadium for a selection of their winter home games from 2009-2012. In April 2012 the FA announced that the Stadium would be one of the venues for the UEFA European Women's U17 Championship Finals. In July 2012 the Stadium was selected for two international Men's U17s matches, alongside Burton's Pirelli Stadium and Northampton's Sixfields Stadium, as part of a friendly tournament involving England, Italy, Turkey and Portugal. The stadium hosted the Portugal U17s 1-0 Italy U17s, and Italy U17s 3-1 Turkey U17s matches. In 2012 the stadium was also proposed as a new home for Coventry City F.C., due to mounting debts regarding the Ricoh Arena and arguments that the rent is far too high in comparison to clubs around them and below the Premier League In December 2013 Leicester Road Stadium hosted 4 UEFA Women's U17 European Cup Final group fixtures.

He was one of the first to argue for a focus upon aesthetic education within music education.McCarthy, M., & Goble, J. S. (2005). The praxial philosophy in historical perspective. In D. J. Elliott (Ed.), Praxial music education: Reflections and dialogues (pp. 19-51). New York, NY: Oxford University Press. For most of his career, he was a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Life and career Born in Anadarko, Oklahoma, Leonhard was the son of Morris and Dora McRae Leonhard. He was educated at the University of Oklahoma (Bachelor of Music in piano) and Teachers College, Columbia University (Master of Arts and Doctor of Education). Many of Leonhard's teachers were former students of John Dewey, whose ideas influenced Leonhard throughout his career. During his doctoral program, Leonhard studied aesthetics with Susanne Langer. In 1953, as the music education profession was just beginning to rethink its philosophy, Leonhard published his article \\"Music Education—Aesthetic Education.\\"Leonhard, C. (1953). Music education—aesthetic education. Education, 74, 23-26. In this article, Leonhard urged music educators to eschew the instrumental values of music education and to stress the aesthetic value of music. While a graduate student, Leonhard concurrently worked as an instructor and assistant professor of music education at Teachers College. He had previously served in the United States Army during World War II as a field artillery officer. In 1951 he joined the faculty of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where he was appointed professor of music and education, and chair of the graduate program in music education. He was the primary advisor on nearly 100 doctoral dissertations, including those of Eunice Boardman and Wayne Bowman. In addition to Bowman, many important philosophers of music education can trace their lineage back to Leonhard. For example, Bennett Reimer was a student at Illinois who worked with Leonhard and Harry Broudy. Reimer later went on to supervise the dissertations of David J. Elliott and Paul Woodford. In 1986 Leonhard retired from his position at the University of Illinois. In 1988 he was appointed the Director of Research at the National Arts Education Research Center; a post he held through 1994. He died in 2002 at the age of 86. He had been married to Patricia Hagman since 1950. The couple had two children together. Important Contributions In 1958, Leonhard's essay on evaluation appeared in Basic Concepts in Music Education. Along with his student, Robert House, Leonhard published Foundations and Principles of Music Education in 1959. In 1963, Leonhard and Richard Colwell initiated the Bulletin of the Council for Research in Music Education. In 1964, Leonhard was a presenter at the Seminar on Comprehensive Musicianship. In the 1970s, Leonhard edited a series of books called Contemporary Perspectives in Music Education. The series aimed to establish “a pattern for music teacher education based on the areas of knowledge and processes involved in music education rather than on the levels and specializations in music education.”Reimer, B. (1970). A philosophy of music education (1st ed.). Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall. According to Leonhard, the “mastery of all of these processes and areas of knowledge is essential for the successful music educator regardless of his area of specialization and the level at which he teaches.”Reimer, B. (1970). A philosophy of music education (1st ed.). Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall. Six titles were published:According to Heller (1995b), only the six titles listed in the entry were published as part of the series. However, looking at dust jackets from 1970 editions of the Reimer, Gordon, and Madsen and Madsen books, two other books (viz., The Role of Method in Music Education by Charles Leonhard and Improving Instruction in Music Education by David L.

His actions as commandant of the garrison at Anahuac in Mexican Texas in 1831 and 1832 led to the events known as the Anahuac Disturbances. Born and raised in the United States, Bradburn's first career was as a merchant and slave trader. He likely first entered Mexico in 1812 as part of the Gutiérrez–Magee Expedition fighting Spanish control of Texas. When the expedition was quashed, Bradburn moved to Louisiana, where he served in the Louisiana militia during the Battle of New Orleans. After his discharge, Bradburn spent several years fighting for Mexican independence. After Spain relinquished its hold on Mexico in 1821, Bradburn became an officer in the new Mexican Army, in which he served as a courier for Emperor Agustín de Iturbide. In 1830, Bradburn established a new military and customs post, Anahuac, in Texas. The local settlers resented Bradburn's efforts to withhold land titles from those who had squatted in unauthorized areas. They were further angered by his attempts to enforce customs laws which had been largely ignored. The hard feelings escalated when Bradburn, following Mexican law, refused to return runaway slaves to their owners in the United States. After receiving a hoax letter claiming that armed men were marching on Anahuac to retrieve runaway slaves, Bradburn arrested local lawyers William B. Travis and Patrick Churchill Jack. Settlers were outraged that Travis did not receive some of the protections offered by the United States Bill of Rights, even though these rights were not guaranteed in Mexico. A large force of Texians marched on Anahuac to secure Travis's release. The resulting confrontation forced Bradburn's expulsion from Texas and encouraged other immigrants to take armed action against Mexican soldiers. As a result of his actions, Bradburn was \\"one of the most maligned men in historical accounts of\\" Texas in the 19th century.Henson (1982), p. 13. Early years John Davis Bradburn was born in 1787 in Virginia.Although Mexican military records report his birthplace as Richmond, Virginia, Henson found no indication that any Bradburn families lived in the area. She believes he was likely born in one of the frontier counties of Virginia. Henson (1982), p. 20. His father was probably William C. Bradburn,Henson (1982), p. 20. and John likely had an elder brother, also named William.Henson (1982), p. 21. At some point after 1800, the family moved to Christian County, Kentucky. As a young adult, Bradburn became a merchant in nearby Springfield, Tennessee.Henson (1982), p. 22. He trafficked in slaves and was once jailed in Natchez, Mississippi, over a disputed slave sale. It is likely that Bradburn participated in the 1812 Gutiérrez–Magee Expedition, which intended to establish independent Mexican control of Spanish Texas.Biographer Margaret Swett Henson believes Bradburn participated in this expedition because of his election as a militia officer in 1814; most of the men who elected him were documented members of the expedition, and she speculates they would have only voted for someone who had already proven himself militarily. Henson (1982), p. 23. The rebels were initially successful, taking Nacogdoches, Goliad, and provincial capital San Antonio de Béxar. After the execution of Governor Manuel María de Salcedo, many Americans left the movement in disgust. The remaining members of the expedition were decisively defeated by royalist forces at the Battle of Medina in August 1813; a few Americans escaped to Louisiana.Henson (1982), pp. 23–24. By 1814, Bradburn resided in Louisiana. Rumors abounded that British troops were preparing to land troops to capture the New Orleans region. After the December call for volunteers to help defend the state, Bradburn enlisted in the Eighteenth Louisiana Regiment and was elected third lieutenant. His unit arrived in New Orleans on January 24, just after the Battle of New Orleans, and remained until martial law ended March 11.Henson (1982), pp. 24–25.Bradburn served alongside James Bowie and his brother Rezin. Edmondson (2000), p. 145. Mexican War of Independence Following his discharge from the militia, Bradburn remained in New Orleans. The Mexican War of Independence was raging, and many filibusters—men planning unauthorized military expeditions—gathered in the city to plan the liberation of Texas from Spanish control. Bradburn became a sergeant major in the movement led by Juan Pablo Anaya and Henry Perry.Henson (1982), p. 26. When Perry's forces entered Texas in early 1816, Bradburn was initially stationed in Nacogdoches to direct recruits and supplies to the main body of the expedition.Henson (1982), pp. 27–28.Epperson (1989), p. 438. In June, Bradburn joined Perry at his headquarters, a bluff along the Trinity River which became known as Perry's Point. Little activity occurred over the next few months.Edmondson (2000), p. 145. In November 1816, another filibuster, Martín Javier Mina y Larrea, arrived with more men and supplies. Mina planned to invade Tampico and assist the revolutionary army in the Mexican interior.Henson (1982), p. 29. Bradburn allied himself with Mina, whose plan was better-developed than Perry's, and was soon appointed second-in-command of the American troops, under Colonel Gilford Young.Henson (1982), p. 30. The filibusters traveled to Fort Sombrero, an insurgent stronghold in Guanajuato province. Rebel supplies dwindled when the fort was besieged by Spanish royalist troops.Henson (1982), p. 31. Mina attempted to negotiate a surrender, but the Spanish offered safe passage only to native Mexicans; Americans and other foreigners were required to surrender at discretion. As the filibusters pondered this development, Young was killed, leaving Bradburn in sole command of the American troops. On August 19, he ordered a retreat. Spanish cavalrymen attacked, and less than one-quarter of the Americans escaped. Bradburn served under Agustín de Iturbide (pictured). Bradburn remained in Mexico and soon joined the forces led by Vicente Guerrero.Henson (1982), pp. 32–33. Despite Guerrero's reputation for cruelty, the two men developed a close relationship. At least once, Bradburn countermanded Guerrero's orders, refusing to allow the execution of captured Spanish officers. His action impressed Agustín de Iturbide, the commander of the Spanish forces fighting Guerrero. In December 1820, Bradburn left the insurgent army to join Iturbide. Most Mexican historians believe his defection was due to a weariness with the conflict, though at least one historian speculates that Bradburn joined the Spanish Army as Guerrero's spy. Within a month, Bradburn had been appointed intermediary between Iturbide and Guerrero.Henson (1982), p. 34. Iturbide defected from the Spanish Army, intending to place himself at the head of a new independent Mexico.Henson (1982), p. 35. He recruited his forces from both the Spanish and rebel armies, offering all who joined him an equal or higher rank in his new organization. Bradburn was appointed a colonel.Edmondson (2000), p. 146. Independent Mexico In August 1821, Mexico officially received its independence from Spain.Henson (1982), p. 36. The following year Iturbide became emperor of Mexico and sent Bradburn as an envoy to the United States. Bradburn returned with news that the United States was prepared to recognize Mexico as an independent country. Later that year, Iturbide arranged Bradburn's marriage to a well-connected Mexican woman, María Josefa Hurtado de Mendoza y Caballero de los Olivos. Her brother, Agustín Hurtado, was the 9th Count of the Valley of Orizaba.Henson (1982), p. 37. Bradburn and his wife had one son, who entered the priesthood as a young man.Henson (1982), p. 19. Iturbide was overthrown in 1823.Henson (1982), p. 38. The new government was based on federalist principles, and Bradburn, a staunch centralist, kept a discreet distance from politics over the next few years. He reappears in Mexican records in 1828, when he was granted a monopoly on steamboat traffic on the Rio Grande from the Gulf of Mexico through Coahuila. His charter was revoked in 1830 when he was unable to meet its terms.Henson (1982), p. 44.Bradburn was required to have the venture operational by April 1830. Political unrest and a threatened Spanish invasion had delayed the venture until early 1830. Bradburn then hired Henry Austin, a cousin of Texas empresario Stephen F. Austin, to run a steamboat. Austin discovered that the river was too shallow in some places and abandoned the idea. Henson (1982), pp. 44–45. Texas The new federalist government officially authorized immigration from the United States to Mexican Texas in 1824. The resulting mass influx of settlers, combined with failed attempts by the United States government to purchase the territory, concerned Mexican authorities, who feared that the United States wished to forcibly take Texas. In response, on April 6, 1830, the Mexican government enacted a series of laws restricting immigration from the United States. The laws also called for the establishment of customs houses within Texas to begin enforcing customs duties.Manchaca (2001), p. 200. On October 4, 1830, Bradburn was ordered to create the first customs post, to be located at Galveston Bay. He was chosen for the assignment partly because he was bilingual and would be able to communicate with both the immigrants from the United States and the native Mexicans and partly due to his knowledge of the area and its terrain. The dot shows the location of Anahuac, Texas. Bradburn and his men arrived at Galveston Bay on October 26 and established a post atop the same bluff where Bradburn had camped with Perry. As ordered, Bradburn named the fort Anahuac after the Anahuac Valley, the ancient capital of the Aztecs.Henson (1982), p. 51. The soldiers erected two large kilns to produce bricks to build a more permanent fort. When the kilns were operational, however, Bradburn sold the bricks to settlers who wished to live near the fort.Edmondson (2000), p. 147. The town grew quickly and by June 1 the population had reached 300 civilians and 170 military personnel. At this point, Bradburn redirected his attention to building a permanent fort. The soldiers, who had been largely idle while the kilns produced bricks for settlers, were angry that they were now expected to do significant physical labor. Their displeasure was augmented by Bradburn's high standards; he often forced the men to tear down and rebuild sections that did not meet his benchmark for quality. Many soldiers deserted. Bradburn also angered the colonists. The Mexican Constitution of 1824 prohibited immigrants from settling with of the coast, and many foreigners had established homes close to the coast. In January 1831, a new state land commissioner, José Francisco Madero, arrived to grant land titles to people who had settled in the area before 1830. Bradburn believed that only the federal government had the authority to grant titles in the area near the coast, and that as the representative of the federal government he was the only individual who could authorize surveys of the land.Henson (1982), pp. 58–62. Bradburn arrested Madero and his assistant, José María Jesús Carbajal. Within 10 days, Bradburn received orders from his superiors to release the men. Madero issued deeds as quickly as he could.Henson (1982), pp. 63, 65. Madero then established an official council, an ayuntamiento, for the residents in the disputed area. The new community, \\"Villa de la Santissima Trinidad de la Libertad\\", is now known as Liberty, Texas.Henson (1982), p. 66. Although Bradburn believed that Liberty was created illegally, as the town was too close to the coast, he made no attempt to interfere with its establishment.Henson (1982), p. 67. On December 9, Bradburn's superior, Commandant General Manuel Mier y Terán, ordered Bradburn to dismantle the town and establish the ayuntamiento at Anahuac.Henson (1982), p. 77.Edmondson (2000), p. 148. =Tariffs= The Mexican government had granted specific tariff exemptions to the first group of immigrants to Texas. Known as the Old Three Hundred, this initial colony had been established by empresario Stephen F. Austin. Most Texas colonists, including those who settled in Austin's other land grants, erroneously assumed the exemption applied to all settlers.Henson (1982), p. 69. With Bradburn's arrival, tariff collections began. After hearing complaints from ship captains, Bradburn's influence helped the law be amended to curtail some excessive charges. Nevertheless, colonists were angry that their goods were more expensive. Many of the settlers in Austin's colony also refused to accept that their exemption had expired and were vocal in their dislike of the tariffs and Bradburn. To keep the peace, Bradburn appointed local men to collect fees near Austin's colony; these men did not try to enforce the law rigidly, and tensions cooled.Henson (1982), pp. 69–70. In an effort to resolve the issues, Stephen F. Austin wrote Bradburn seeking help in getting the tariffs repealed throughout Texas. Bradburn promptly forwarded the letter up the chain of command. Bradburn's commander sent Austin a sharply-worded letter which, according to Bradburn's biographer Margaret Swett Henson, \\"remind[ed] the empresario that tariff was collected by every nation in the world but that only in Brazoria did it cause rioting\\".Henson (1982), p. 85. Austin blamed Bradburn for the reprimand. =Anahuac Disturbances= In January 1832, Bradburn received a letter listing 10 men in his jurisdiction who favored separating Texas from Mexico. From that point on, according to Henson, \\"Bradburn became increasingly obsessed about the Anglo-Americans and their intentions, believing that every event was part of a conspiracy to detach Texas\\".Henson (1982), p. 87. Several months later, local men organized a militia, supposedly to protect the settlement from Indian attacks.Not only was it Bradburn's duty to protect the settlers from external threats, the only natives in the area were peaceful. Henson (1982), p. 90. Mexican law forbade residents from creating militias, so Bradburn arrested the ringleader, Patrick Jack.Edmondson (2000), p. 151. Although citizens were outraged, few were willing to intervene.Ward (1960), p. 215. An exception was Robert \\"Three- Legged Willie\\" Williamson—his threat to kill Bradburn resulted in Jack's release.Ward (1960), p. 216.Henson (1982), p. 90. Bradburn's arrest of William Barret Travis (pictured) triggered the Anahuac Disturbances. Bradburn was also worried about the intentions of Jack's law partner, William Barret Travis. The previous year, Bradburn had granted asylum to two men who had escaped slavery in Louisiana.Mexican law forbade slavery, but most American-born colonists disregarded the law, classifying their slaves as indentured servants with a 99-year contract. Travis represented the men's owner in a series of failed attempts to return the former slaves to the United States.Edmondson (2000), p. 149. In May 1832, Bradburn received a letter warning that 100 armed men were stationed away, intent on reclaiming the slaves. After realizing the letter was a hoax, Bradburn arrested Travis for questioning. He intended to send Travis to Matamoros for a military trial on charges of attempted insurrection. Conviction on this charge would have led to Travis's execution.Davis (2006), p. 83. The settlers were outraged that the arrest did not require a warrant, a statement of charges, or trial by jury. Most were unfamiliar with Mexican law and assumed that the United States Bill of Rights still applied to them.Henson (1982), p. 96. Jack threatened Bradburn, who angrily rearrested him.Henson (1982), p. 97. Colonists had reached their limit, and men began marching towards Anahuac from various Texas settlements.Henson (1982), p. 99. By early June, over 150 Texians had gathered. They elected Frank W. Johnson as commander. Without firing a shot, Johnson's group soon captured Bradburn's 19 cavalry officers, who had been trying to reconnoiter the Texian position. This left Bradburn with only 80 soldiers; the rest had deserted.Edmondson (2000), p. 154.Edmondson (2000), p. 155. On June 10, the insurgents occupied buildings in northern Anahuac and began negotiations to peacefully end the dispute. Mexican officers agreed to release their prisoners into civilian custody if the Texians would release the captured cavalry officers and then withdraw from the town to Turtle Bayou.Henson (1982), p. 103.Henson (1982), p. 104. Although most of the rebels left Anahuac, 15 to 30 men remained scattered through the town. Bradburn believed this violated their agreement and in retaliation threatened to fire on the village within two hours. Most of the Texians believed that Bradburn had never intended to follow the agreement. Fearing imminent cannon fire, the women and children of Anahuac fled. Mexican soldiers briefly engaged the men who remained, leading to the deaths of five Mexican soldiers and one Texan. After the skirmish, the remaining Texians gathered at Turtle Bayou to await the arrival of cannons that were stored at Brazoria.Henson (1982), p. 105. Taking advantage of the civil war currently engulfing the Mexican interior, the Texians drafted the Turtle Bayou Resolutions. In this document, they declared themselves federalists who supported rebellious Mexican general Antonio López de Santa Anna and decried \\"the present dynasty\\" which gave them military order instead of civil authority. While the Texians waited for their artillery, Bradburn sent messages to Colonel Piedras, stationed at Nacogdoches ( north), and Colonel Elosúa at San Antonio ( to the west). On June 19, Piedras and about 100 of his men set out to reinforce Bradburn.Henson (1982), p. 106. Unsure how many Texians he actually faced, Piedras was eager to defuse the conflict without violence. At his urging, Bradburn agreed to relinquish his authority, but his chosen successor, Lieutenant Colonel Félix María Subarán, refused to take his place.Lieutenant Colonel Felix Maria Subarán had been sent to Texas as a political prisoner because he supported the federalist leader Antonio López de Santa Anna against the current centralist administration. Bradburn believed that Subarán would defend Texas against any separation attempts. Henson (1982), p. 103. Piedras agreed to take temporary command of the garrison. On July 2, he transferred the prisoners to civilian authorities; within a week they were all released with no charges filed.Edmondson (2000), p. 158. Piedras left for Nacogdoches on July 8; three days later, the bulk of the Anahuac troops declared themselves federalists. Only Bradburn and a few others remained committed to the centralist cause.Henson (1982), p. 110. Later life After an aborted assassination attempt—widely attributed to Travis—Bradburn resolved to leave Texas. None of the local ship captains would allow him passage. On July 13, Subarán announced that he would not guarantee the safety of any officers who still supported the centralist government. That night, Bradburn left Anahuac on foot.Henson (1982), pp. 111–12. Years later, Anahuac carpenter William B. Scates related that after Bradburn's departure, locals gathered up the other centralist officers and tarred and feathered them before taking them into the water and \\"scour[ing] them with corn cobs to scrub their Bradburn sins off\\".quoted in Henson (1986), p. 7. On August 6, Bradburn arrived in New Orleans and sought refuge with the Mexican consul.Henson (1982), p. 113. Many New Orleans residents had a highly unfavorable view of Bradburn; ten days earlier the local paper had published a letter from Travis describing Bradburn as a \\"tyrant\\" and saying that Travis had been jailed solely for his political opinions.Henson (1982), p. 114. Bradburn quickly booked passage to Matamoros.Henson (1982), p. 115. On arriving in Mexico, he learned that he had been officially relieved of his duties in Anahuac on June 29, before his superiors had learned of the armed conflict.Henson (1982), p. 116. Bradburn remained in the army, fighting for the centralist government. Acting president Anastasio Bustamante promoted Bradburn to brigadier general after his bravery in a major battle on September 18. For the next few months, Bradburn commanded a regiment near Reynosa.Henson (1982), p. 117. In December, Bustamante and Santa Anna negotiated an end to the war. Bradburn's forces were merged with that of the federalist general operating in the same area, Lorenzo Cortina. Cortina commanded the joint regiment, and Bradburn retired from military service.Henson (1982), p. 118. For several years, Bradburn raised vegetables near Matamoros. Henson related that \\"a Texas visitor noted that [Bradburn] had the respect of the foreign community in the city, even the Anglo merchants\\".Henson (1982), p. 119. When the Texas Revolution erupted in 1835, Bradburn rejoined the military under General José de Urrea on the condition that he was not required to fight in eastern Texas. Urrea's forces eradicated opposition along the Texas Gulf Coast, and Bradburn was left to command the small port at Copano, just north of the Nueces River.Henson (1982), p. 120.Bradburn did not participate in the Battle of Coleto or the Goliad Massacre. Henson (1982), p. 120. In April 1836, Santa Anna (now president of Mexico) was captured at the Battle of San Jacinto and all Mexican troops were ordered to retreat beyond the Rio Grande. Bradburn remained at Copano to intercept Mexican supply vessels before they could fall into the hands of the Texians.Henson (1982), p. 121. In mid-May, he was ordered to retreat south to Refugio and wait for the arrival of a specific supply ship. His force was reduced to five men. After two deserted and the remainder fell ill, Bradburn set out alone and on foot for Mexico. He reached Matamoros in ill health on June 13.Henson (1982), p. 122. Bradburn again served in the army during the federalist war in 1838, but by the end of 1840 he had retired to Matamoros. He died on April 20 and was buried on his ranch, likely east of present-day Mission.Henson (1982), p. 123. The property is now the home of the La Lomita Seminary, but there is no record of the location of Bradburn's grave.Henson (1982), p. 124. Legacy Historical markers in Anahuac commemorating Fort Anahuac and Robert McAlpin Williamson, who briefly secured Patrick Jack's release Bradburn's death was announced in Texas newspapers in a very neutral manner. The Telegraph and Texas Register said simply that \\"Gen. Bradburn, who had long been in the Mexican service, and formerly commanded the garrison of Anahuac, lately died at Matamoros\\".quoted in Henson (1982), p. 125. The history books of the time did not speak kindly of his actions. In his 1841 book Texas and the Texans; or, Advance of the Anglo-Americans to the South-West Henry Stuart Foote described Bradburn as an \\"evil spirit, hovering, with gloomy and malignant aspect, in the rear of Santa Anna's army\\".quoted in Henson (1982), p. 14. Henson posits that Bradburn was \\"one of the most maligned men in historical accounts of that period\\",Henson (1982), p. 13. partially because he had no descendants to try to \\"preserv[e] his name and reputation in Texas\\". Many of Bradburn's contemporaries appeared to share Stephen F. Austin's belief that: \\"The fact is [Bradburn] is incompetent to such a command and is half crazy part of his time.\\" His actions \\"appeared arbitrary and authoritarian to the colonists, who were ignorant about the power traditionally exercised by the Mexican military\\".Henson (1986), p. 3. Texians were further disgusted that Bradburn, who shared their American roots, often sided against American immigrants. According to historian J. R. Edmondson, colonists \\"would probably have resented any officer—Anglo or not—sent among them to initiate the collection of customs\\". Few Texans in the 19th century understood that Bradburn was following orders and attempting to enforce the national laws of Mexico, and that he was no longer bound by the laws of the United States. Even as late as the 20th century, historians often described Bradburn as a \\"petty tyrant\\".Ward (1960), p. 214. Historian William C. Davis believes that Bradburn \\"overreacted and made heroes of two local malcontents whose actions their own people otherwise had not been much inclined to sanction\\".Davis (2006), p. 86. The resulting Turtle Bayou Resolutions empowered other Texians to follow a similar course of action. Many communities began declaring in favor of Santa Anna, and in August Piedras and his troops were driven from Nacogdoches.Davis (2006), pp. 86–89. Their retreat into the Mexican interior temporarily left eastern Texas free of Mexican military control, encouraging the colonists to increase their political activity.Davis (2006), p. 89. Shortly thereafter, colonists organized the Convention of 1832, which marked the first attempt to gather Texians from each of the colonies to discuss their common goals.Davis (2006), p. 91. Shortly after Bradburn left Texas, the garrison at Anahuac was dismantled. With no troops to purchase supplies, the civilians in the area soon dispersed. The fort was not regarrisoned until January 1835, when Captain Antonio Tenorio arrived with 40 men. His command was no more successful than Bradburn's; within months Travis led a group of insurgents to overthrow Tenorio in the second of the Anahuac Disturbances.Epperson (1989), p. 439.

Biography Senofsky was born in Philadelphia in 1926. His parents were violinists and had moved to the United States from the Soviet Union. He started on violin at age three and was taught by his father. His talent was noted early on. At age six he won a scholarship to study with Louis Persinger. At age twelve he won a scholarship to study at Juilliard with Ivan Galamian, which turned into a twelve-year association. Senofsky served in the milliary during World War II. Following the war he debuted in New York City and won the William Naumburg Competition in 1946. Soon after, he started to perform with the Cleveland Orchestra under George Szell. He was the assistant concertmaster of the Cleveland Orchestra from 1951 to 1955. In 1955 he became the first American to win the Queen Elisabeth Competition, an international competition in Belgium. Subsequently, he became a jury member of the competition and toured extensively and internationally, including in Australia, Africa, Europe, South America, United States, Soviet Union and East Asia. In the United States he performed with the New York Philharmonic, American Symphony Orchestra, Chicago Symphony, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Pittsburgh Symphony and others. Senofsky was a faculty member at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore and taught from 1965 to 1996. During this period, he gave a performance at the Library of Congress which was recorded and subsequently released. He founded the American Artists International Foundation which prepared young violinists for competition. In 1983 he was invited to China by the Shanghai Conservatory to teach, perform, and start a music program. In a 1979 interview, Senofsky said: \\"to me music is a higher calling than just a profession\\". In 1999 he was featured in a documentary about renowned musicians whose later careers were spent away from the spotlight. He was a well respected teacher and was called an American musical hero by Newsweek. His students perform in major symphony orchestras. He played a 1771 Balestrieri violin and a 1757 Landolfi violin. As a young man Senofsky was athletic and played football. In later years he enjoyed gatherings with friends and had a sense of humor. Senofsky died of complications from heart and lung disease on June 21, 2002, at age 76 in his home in Baltimore, Maryland.

The original German title is simply (literally: \\"following\\" or: \\"the act of following\\"). It is centered on an exposition of the Sermon on the Mount, in which Bonhoeffer spells out what he believes it means to follow Christ. It was first published in 1937, when the rise of the Nazi regime was underway in Germany and it was against this background that Bonhoeffer's theology of costly discipleship developed, which ultimately led to his death.  Summary  One of the most quoted parts of the book deals with the distinction which Bonhoeffer makes between \\"cheap\\" and \\"costly\\" grace. According to Bonhoeffer, Cheap grace, Bonhoeffer says, is to hear the gospel preached as follows: \\"Of course you have sinned, but now everything is forgiven, so you can stay as you are and enjoy the consolations of forgiveness.\\" The main defect of such a proclamation is that it contains no demand for discipleship. In contrast to costly grace, Bonhoeffer argues that as Christianity spread, the Church became more \\"secularised\\", accommodating the demands of obedience to Jesus to the requirements of society. In this way, \\"the world was Christianised, and grace became its common property.\\" But the hazard of this was that the gospel was cheapened, and obedience to the living Christ was gradually lost beneath formula and ritual, so that in the end, grace could literally be sold for monetary gain. But all the time, within the church, there had been a living protest against this process: the monastic movement. This served as a \\"place where the older vision was kept alive.\\" Unfortunately, \\"monasticism was represented as an individual achievement which the mass of the laity could not be expected to emulate\\"; the commandments of Jesus were limited to \\"a restricted group of specialists\\" and a double standard arose: \\"a maximum and a minimum standard of church obedience.\\" This was dangerous, Bonhoeffer says, because whenever the church was accused of being too worldly, it could always point to monasticism as \\"the opportunity of a higher standard within the fold - and thus justify the other possibility of a lower standard for others.\\" So the monastic movement, instead of serving as a pointer for all Christians, became a justification for the status quo. Bonhoeffer remarks how this was rectified by Luther at the Reformation, when he brought Christianity \\"out of the cloister.\\" However, he thinks that subsequent generations have again cheapened the preaching of the forgiveness of sins, and this has seriously weakened the church: \\"The price we are having to pay today in the shape of the collapse of the organised church is only the inevitable consequence of our policy of making grace available to all at too low a cost. We gave away the word and sacraments wholesale, we baptised, confirmed, and absolved a whole nation without condition. Our humanitarian sentiment made us give that which was holy to the scornful and unbelieving... But the call to follow Jesus in the narrow way was hardly ever heard.\\"  Influence  Eberhard Bethge has argued that Bonhoeffer's writings, which culminated in the Ethics and Letters and Papers from Prison, form a seamless continuity, stretching back at least as far as The Cost of Discipleship. Unlike Bonhoeffer's later writings, The Cost of Discipleship has been widely read by both conservative and liberal Christians and is still read and quoted today. The term \\"cheap grace\\" was coined by The Rev. Adam Clayton Powell, Sr., then-pastor of Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, NY. Bonhoeffer attended the church when at Union Theological Seminary, and for a season taught Sunday School there. Bonhoeffer benefited from the protest culture of the African American church and gleaned from it social gospel elements that he would take with him back to Germany. The anti- temporal power ethic would aid him to resist the Nazi regime. The notion of cheap grace has been used by Mike Lofgren to criticize the increasing dominance of the Christian right over the Republican Party coupled with what he saw as an increasing disregard within the party for other values: Similarly, Katelyn Beaty of Christianity Today warned against the Christian use of cheap grace in excusing powerful men guilty of sexual assault.Beaty, Katelyn. \\"The Mistake Christians Made in Defending Bill O’Reilly.\\" New York Times. 2 May 2017. 2 May 2017.

Ganapathi Agrahram is named after the most famous Lord Maha Ganapathi temple situated at this village.  Temples in Ganapathi Agraharam There is a famous Maha Ganapthi (Ganesha) temple here. The lord has been installed by Sage Agastya and has been worshipped by Sage Gautama Maharishi. The temple deity (Ganesha) is considered very powerful by the people. There is one Shiva temple, Shri Varadaraja Perumal temple(Vishnu), Thropathi amman (Amman)temple and (Ayyanar) temple here.  Streets and Localities  Ganapathi Agraharam is a village panchayat and the main agraharam has South Street, North Street and West Street apart from other main areas. The Great Maha Ganapathi Temple lies at one corner of where South and North Street joins. The temple is adjoined by Shri Varadaraja Perumal Temple, A Ther Mutti and a vast stretch of agricultural fields. Both South and North street houses are of a typical Agraharam style construction.  Festivals and Occasions  Shri Vinayaka Chathurthi Every year, A grand festival season begins before Vinayaka Chadurthi to worship Lord Maha Ganapathi and get His divine blessings. People from many other places come by this season for pooja and worship. Vedic gurus are invited to chant 4 vedas every day in the festival. The festivity of the temple begins with Summer Festival Rajagopuram Anniversary also known as \\"Palkudam Festival\\" or \\"Aandu Vizha\\" performed on \\"Panguni Anusham\\" day. Beginning in 2009, \\"Pavithra Utsavam\\" has been initiated to be performed for Maha Ganapathi every year. In 2009, it was performed on 25 November. 2010 Pavitra Utsavam was between 8 and 11 November. Maha Kumbabishegam was performed on 29 June 2012. Nearly 20000 people participated and had the blessings of Lord Maha Ganapathi. Moreover people in this village never perform the special pujas for Lord Vinayaka in their home, because they believe the Lord Maha Ganapathi who really reside in the temple. So one who like to devote their spiritual deed upon Vinayaka has been performed in this temple itself rather individually During Vinayaka Chathurthi, people from the agraharam prepare modhakam and offer to Lord Ganesha at the temple. Unlike other places throughout India, clay ganesha is not made and no pooja will be performed at home.

It is a network address book so everything can be managed from Windows or Mac as well and lastly you can also set your one callerID picture and status for your friends to see when you call them) FusionOne (whose backup and synchronization solutions lets users easily transfer and update mobile content, including contact information, among different devices); Loopt (whose Loopt service provides a social compass alerting users when friends are near); OnePIN (whose CallerXchange person-to- person contact exchange service lets users share contact info with one click on the mobile phone); and VoxMobili (whose Phone Backup and Synchronized Address Book solutions let users safeguard and synchronize their contact information among different devices). In 2007, the Rich Communication Services communication protocol was formed. RCS combines different services defined by 3GPP and Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) with an enhanced phonebook with broad implications for the mobile social address book. In a February 2017 Wired Magazine article, RCS was quoted as \\"...infected with bureaucracy, complexity, and irrelevance,\\" by industry analyst Dean Bubley in 2015, calling RCS a zombie: dead, but somehow still ambling around. The same active goes on to say: \\"Google sees it differently. For the company with seemingly thousands of messaging platforms, each one with different features and different audiences, RCS presents an opportunity.\\"  References External links * Loopt website * OnePIN website * VoxMobili website * PicDial website Category:Social networks Category:Directories ","title":"Mobile social address book"},{"id":"20893504","text":"Felpham Community College is a maintained comprehensive secondary school for pupils aged 11 to 18. It caters to approximately 1400 pupils in Years 7 to 13, including nearly 200 in its sixth form. History Until the 1970s, students from primary schools in the village of Felpham attended secondary schools in the nearby town of Bognor Regis. A secondary school was opened in Felpham in 1974/5 as Felpham Comprehensive School. In 1978 it accommodated around 800 pupils and in 1980 the initial intake of pupils had reached the sixth form. The neighbouring Arun Leisure Centre was also completed at this time with the School sharing its sports facilities. The school was renamed as Felpham Community College in c.1991 by which time pupil number had risen to around 1300. An unnamed Student of Felpham Community College in 2013 was successful in taking part in a world record for The Guinness Book of Records. The attempt was for 'most spaghetti eaten in 10 minutes'. The record took place in the schools cafeteria, which has now been nicknamed 'the spaghet arena' by students of the school. However, the school discredits this. Campus The college is sited on a campus which it shares with the local leisure centre (Arun leisure centre).

As a teacher in twentieth century Ottumwa, Iowa, Clark spent ten minutes in each of her chorus rehearsals students telling them about composers or helping them recognize the stylistic features of the work that made it possible to place it in its correct historical context. Shortly thereafter, the phonograph added new opportunities for students to listen to music. Clark, who by 1903 had moved to Milwaukee, told of her introduction to the potential of Edison's invention. She realized the difference it could make to her students if they could hear professional recordings. Her principal agreed and approved the purchase of a machine for the schools. Curriculum Development Clark made herself an authority on the use of the phonograph to teach music to children and in 1910 spoke to the Wisconsin Teachers Association on \\"Victrolas in the Schools.\\" Edward Bailey Birge, president of the Music Supervisors National Conference (later MENC), invited her to present this subject at his MSNC program in Detroit. Within a year she had moved to Camden, New Jersey, where she established an educational department for the Victor Talking Machine Company. She supervised the preparation of recordings designed for use in the classroom. Recordings were also developed to correlate music with English and American literature. Among other responsibilities, Clark assisted record and Victrola dealers in setting up educational displays to help music educators learn the benefits of the phonograph. Victor issued a number of instructional booklets prepared by Clark and assistants. Clark remained with Victor for the rest of her professional career but kept up with the times in the 1920s, when she promoted the radio as an avenue to music appreciation.

He was arrested on 9 December 1979, while he was a student at Government Degree College Turbat, on charges of firing at the military officer from the Gulf state of Oman. The Omani military officer was recruiting Pakistani Baloch soldiers from Balochistan province to suppress the Dhofar Rebellion. Oman at the time was facing a Marxist–Leninist insurgency in its Dhofar province. Ever since Oman took control of the Balochistan enclave of Gwadar in the 18th Century (now part of Pakistan), it had hired foot soldiers from Balochistan to serve in the Sultan of Oman's Armed Forces. The BSO, being a leftist organization, was opposed to the recruitment to fight against the Dhofar rebels, whose ideology had similarities with its own. They saw it as aiming to 'pervert' the youth in Baloch society against Marxist–Leninist teachings by offering huge salaries for their services in a mercenary army. Hameed was tried by a special military Court and condemned to death. The death sentence was carried out on 11 June 1981 in Mach prison.

Resolution The Security Council began by stating that all the proliferation of nuclear weapons posed a threat to international peace and security. It was concerned at the tests conducted by India and Pakistan and of a potential arms race in South Asia. The importance of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test- Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the dismantling of nuclear weapons was emphasised. The Security Council condemned the Indian Pokhran-II test on 11 and 13 May and the Pakistani Chagai-I test on 28 and 30 May. It demanded that both countries stop testing immediately and asked all countries to no longer carry out nuclear weapons tests. India and Pakistan were also asked to show restraint, refrain from provocative moves and to resume dialogue. Both countries were also called upon to cease their nuclear weapons programmes, cease developing ballistic missiles and fissile material. All countries were urged to prohibit the export of equipment, materials or technology that could in any way assist programmes in either country. The resolution recognised that the tests constituted a serious threat towards global non-proliferation and disarmament. In return for ending their nuclear programmes, the Security Council had offered to help in the settlement of the Kashmir conflict. Reaction The two countries involved reacted angrily to the adoption of the resolution, with the Indian Foreign Ministry describing it as \\"coercive and unhelpful\\" while Pakistan said the presence of nuclear weapons in South Asia is now a fact. However, the Government of India noted that the \\"UN Security Council has recognised that bilateral dialogue has to be the basis of India–Pakistan relations and mutually acceptable solutions have to be found for outstanding issues including Kashmir.

Background Bred by Kinghaven Farms, he is a son of Forty Gran, a daughter of Northern Dancer's son, El Gran Senor. He was sired by a son of Mr. Prospector, Smart Strike, a Leading sire in North America who is the sire of fifty-six stakes winners including 2007 American Horse of the Year Curlin. As a yearling, Square Eddie was sold to a British buyer for $200,000 at the September Keeneland Sales. He was trained in England by John Best for owner David Gorton. Racing career The colt began racing on the turf at age two in England. Making his debut on May 19, 2008, at Windsor Racecourse, Square Eddie finished last in the Weatherbys Bank Conditions Stakes. Entered in the June 17 Group 2 Coventry Stakes, he ran eleventh in a field of eighteen, reportedly coming out of the race with sore shins. In his third start on July 22, under new jockey Steve Drowne, he earned his first win in the Emma Arbery Memorial Maiden Stakes at Salisbury Racecourse, then followed up with a close second-place result in the September 6 Sirenia Stakes at Kempton Park Racecourse. Following his performance in the Sirenia Stakes, Square Eddie was purchased by California businessman J. Paul Reddam, who sent him to Lexington, Kentucky to race on the Polytrack synthetic dirt at Keeneland Race Course. Ridden by Rafael Bejarano, Square Eddie showed an affinity for synthetic dirt, easily winning the Grade 1 Breeders' Futurity Stakes by 4¾ lengths. After this win, Square Eddie was turned over to trainer American Doug O'Neill and was entered in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile on the synthetic surface at Santa Anita Park. With jockey Rafael Bejarano on board, he was running at or near the lead but coming down the stretch dropped back to third behind front-runner Midshipman. Boxed in by the horse running second on the outside, Square Eddie came back to finish second and may have won the race, but Garrett Gomez aboard winner Midshipman made sure there was no room to get past. In a December 26, 2008, article on the ESPN website, award-winning horse racing writer Bill Finley picked Square Eddie as the number two contender behind Remsen Stakes winner Old Fashioned for the first leg of the 2009 U.S. Triple Crown series, the Kentucky Derby. On January 17, 2009, Square Eddie made his three-year-old debut with a second- place finish in the San Rafael Stakes.

History The study of public health in Louisiana began in the early 19th century, when New Orleans suffered from endemic malaria and almost yearly epidemics of cholera and yellow fever. Attempts to control tropical diseases led to the establishment of the Medical College of Louisiana in 1834, founded by a group of young practicing physicians. The founders issued a prospectus that emphasized the lack of knowledge of these diseases and the necessity to study them in the environment in which they occurred. In 1881, formal instruction in hygiene was offered for the first time. Samuel Zemurray provided financial support for the founding of the country's first School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine at Tulane in 1912. Known as \\"Sam the Banana Man,\\" Zemurray backed the institution in part given his own business interests in the banana industry in Honduras, which were at the time greatly affected by diseases like yellow fever. His banana schemes also prompted him to organize and support a military coup at around the same time against Honduran President Miguel R. Dávila in order to restore Manuel Bonilla to power, since Bonilla offered favorable tax breaks and railway concessions for Zemurray's business interests. As part of his work in Honduras, Zemurray contracted with United Fruit Company, which was also one of the first financial backers of the School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The school's launch in 1912 was significant, and as it was part of the movement to establish similar institutions around the world. It was hailed by academicians nationally and internationally as the first such school in the United States, where tropical diseases had had devastating effects, particularly in the South. The first Doctor of Public Health degree was conferred in 1914. Later, in 1919, the School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine merged back into the College of Medicine. The departments of tropical medicine and preventive medicine then merged to establish the department of tropical medicine and public health. Tulane joined the Council on Education of Public Health in 1947. With public health and tropical medicine rapidly expanding, an administrative division of graduate public health was created in 1958, and was re-designated as the Division of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 1961. In 1967, the Hygiene and Tropical Medicine interests reverted to being its own entity of Tulane University and became today's iteration of the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine.

He had convictions for drug smuggling, and was dubbed the \\"casino king\\" for the gambling ventures that made his later fortune, which amounted to around $1 billion at the time of his assassination. Background He was born in Doğanşehir, Malatya Province to Mahmut Topal. Life He has a criminal record at the İstanbul Police for the years 1962, 1969 and 1971 for threatening people and forcing them to sign debt bills, stabbing, injury, beating and murder. =Drug smuggling= According to Belgian newspapers, he was arrested on June 20, 1978 in Antwerp province of Belgium while carrying 6 kilos of heroin. A fake passport was found on him on the name of Sadık Sami Onar, issued by the Gaziantep Police. Besides, he was accused of drug transfer to the USA over Belgium. He was imprisoned in Belgium between June 14, 1978 and July 23, 1981. Then, he was extradited to the US in order to serve a sentence passed on him for heroin trafficking. He was prosecuted in New York and sentenced to five years in prison. His name was mentioned in testimonies of persons, who had been apprehended between January 13 and February 20, 1981 in the Netherlands with vast amounts of heroin. Topal was captured by officers of the Istanbul Narcotics Branch on May 5, 1989 in connection with the aforementioned incident, but released by the İstanbul SSC Prosecution Office. = Casino empire = At the time of his death Topal owned casinos scattered throughout the country,Adana Seyhan, Istanbul Polat Rönesance and Akgün Hotel, Antalya Ofo, Hotel Saray, Hotel Grand Kaptan, Mersin Hilton, Muğla Aries Hotel, and Aydın Onur Hotel oversaw an illicit enterprise that involved 450 people, and had 200 famous customers. According to his tax statement, he registered a loss of 6 billion Turkish Lira in 1993 ($546,493), however an investigation revealed that he had actually made a profit of 473 billion lira ($39m). An extensive 1999 study by the Ministry of Finance contained the following facts on Topal: * He shot from rags to riches in just five years; in 1991 he owned but a cafeteria. * He had withdrawn 4.1 trillion Lira from gamblers' credit cards. * In sum, 14.5 trillion TL, US$98 million, and 23 million DM were deposited into his 137 bank accounts. * A significant number of his 452 properties were acquired as payment for gambling debts. * A significant source of gambling revenue was poker, raising ~$750m between 1994-1996. Topal was also accorded lengthy coverage in the Inspection Board report. Its author, Kutlu Savaş, wrote that Topal would have become a drug lord that posed a threat to the government if unstopped. In 1995, he made certain attempts to take over the management of some hotels and casinos in Ashgabat in Turkmenistan. According to some information, he had dealt with drugs at the Emperyal Casino he owned in Istanbul, and that he had bribed certain members of the security organization in foreign currency.  Death  Topal was gunned down on July 28, 1996 with a Kalashnikov rifle. Some say this was the beginning of the Susurluk scandal. Abdullah Çatlı's fingerprint was allegedly found on the drum of one of the machine guns used.Hurriyet Daily News, 16 December 1996, Turkish Press Scanner Ayhan Çarkın and two other policemen were acquitted for lack of evidence; in 2008 the trial judge claimed this was due to a sabotage of the investigation.Today's Zaman, 30 October 2008, Topal murder investigation covered up, says former judge He left behind 100 trillion lira (on the order of a billion USD). Twenty two of his companies were passed onto his son Murat Topal, daughter Elif Topal, and first wife Safiye Belli. His second wife, Birsu Hilal Altıntaş, inherited a few cars, companies, and properties too. After his death, his casinos were run by Ömer Gultekin.

This was not the case in Japan, as evidenced by the large and active Japanese Society of Precision Engineers., The Japan Society for Precision Engineers, Retrieved February 3, 2011. In November 1985, a joint US-Japanese meeting on precision engineering included a special session to discuss the possibility of forming an American Society. The enthusiasm of the participants and the overwhelming response to a subsequent questionnaire provided momentum. By November 1986, the American Society for Precision Engineering was incorporated and held its first Annual Meeting in Dallas, Texas. The theme of the well-attended meeting, \\"Thresholds in Precision Engineering,\\" was reflected in 28 papers covering a broad spectrum of applications. At this meeting, a Board of Directors was elected with members drawn from industry, private laboratories, government and academia.

Welch (born December 18, 1977) is an American professional wrestler, better known by his ring name The Messiah. Professional wrestling career Welch's professional career began on November 11, 1996, after being trained at the Slam U. Wrestling Gym in Sun Valley, Los Angeles, California. He worked for the school's parent company, the Slammers Wrestling Federation for a time, losing his first professional match there to El Sprito. In the Slammers Wrestling Federation, he worked under the name Iron Mike Ehrhardt. =Xtreme Pro Wrestling (1999–2001)= On November 20, 1999, Welch made his Xtreme Pro Wrestling debut under a mask as The Blunatic, where he lost to Nicole Bass. The following week, The Blunatic teamed with Felony to face Bass in a handicap match, but was again defeated. On December 17, Welch debuted his new ring name The Messiah, a holy man gimmick, where he defeated Johnny Webb. The Messiah soon rose up the card and eventually became a main eventer while wrestling against Extreme Championship Wrestling alumni such as Sabu, Chris Candido and New Jack. The Messiah cemented his spot as one of XPW's main stars when he won both the World Heavyweight and the King of the Deathmatch Championships to become the company's first and only double champion. =Combat Zone Wrestling (2002–2006, 2007, 2010)= After leaving XPW due to both personal issues and an uneasy feeling over the promotion's pornographic ties, Welch made his debut in Combat Zone Wrestling on January 12, 2002 under his Messiah ring name and gimmick, where he accepted then-World Heavyweight Champion Justice Pain's open challenge. At the first Tournament of Death on August 31, Messiah competed in the tournament despite not being an official entrant. Though he managed to defeat Adam Flash in the first round, Messiah lost to Nick Mondo in the semi-finals. Despite the loss, Messiah defeated Flash to win the Iron Man Championship on October 12 before later defeating Justice Pain for the World Heavyweight Championship on December 14. After losing the Iron Man Title to Nick Mondo on February 8, 2003, Messiah later lost the World Heavyweight Title to Zandig on October 25. Messiah would go on to win the World Heavyweight Title two more times before leaving the company in December 2006. One year later, Messiah made a one-night return to compete for the World Heavyweight Title against defending champion Ruckus and Nick Gage, the latter of whom won the match and the title. On July 10, 2010 at the CZW and Jersey All Pro Wrestling co-event Acid-Fest: A Tribute to Trent Acid, Welch returned to compete as The Messiah in a 28-man battle royal, which was ultimately won by Helter Skelter. =Independent circuit (2007, 2009, 2011)= After leaving CZW in 2006, Messiah wrestled three matches for Pro Wrestling Unplugged in 2007 before taking a hiatus. On July 25, 2009, Messiah returned to wrestle a match for the Alternative Wrestling Show, which he lost to Johnny Goodtime. On July 10, 2011 at the second Acid-Fest event, Messiah and Adam Flash defeated Devon Moore and Drew Blood in a tag team match. =Return to CZW (2014)= He was set to appear at CZW Down With The Sickness 2014 event in an 8 Man Tag Team Match.

Biography Kristina Dörfer 2007 Dörfer was the older of two children. She and her younger brother grew up with their mother in Wurzen until she was eighteen years old. Dörfer learned to play the violin at primary school. She performed as a singer for the first time when she was ten years old in her home town, and after that she was hired for various events in the region. In 2002, she reached the \\"Top 20\\" at RTL II for the Show Teenstar. In the same year, she was presented with the Bravo Award for the project 1000 Schulen in Bewegung. The presentation was in Europa-Park and had an audience of 10.000. In 2003, Dörfer was a candidate in the RTL show Deutschland sucht den Superstar, which was the German edition of Pop Idol, reaching the \\"Top 50\\" stage. After moving to the Ruhr Area, Dörfer started her professional singing career in two bands in the Dortmund area in parallel. With the Soulsukkers, she sang soul music, and with Soundset, a cover band, she sang rock and pop music. The following year, Dörfer was selected by ProSieben for the Popstars – Jetzt oder nie program, and on 8 December 2004 was chosen as a member of the band created by the series, Nu Pagadi. The first single of the band, Sweetest Poison reached number one in the German charts. The first album, Your Dark Side, reached number one in the German charts for one week. The band broke up in September 2005 nine months after being formed. Dörfer, who had moved to Munich at the beginning of 2005, started a solo career from October 2005. She was given a contract by Edel Music. After appearing in concerts in various countries in Europe, her first single, Room For More, was released in October 2006.

Magistrate judges are authorized by et seq. The position of \\"magistrate judge\\" or \\"magistrate\\" also exists in some unrelated state courts (see below). While district judges are nominated by the President and confirmed by the United States Senate for lifetime tenure, magistrate judges are appointed by a majority vote of the federal district judges of a particular district and serve terms of eight years if full-time, or four years if part-time, and may be reappointed. As of March 2009 there were 517 full-time and 42 part-time authorized magistrate judgeships, as well as one position combining magistrate judge and clerk of court. Magistrate judges generally oversee first appearances of criminal defendants, set bail, and conduct other administrative duties. Occasionally Presidents nominate magistrate judges for district judge vacancies. The Federal Magistrate Judges Association is the professional association for magistrate judges. Authority The magistrate judge's seat is not a separate court; the authority that a magistrate judge exercises is the jurisdiction of the district court itself, delegated to the magistrate judge by the district judges of the court under governing statutory authority, local rules of court, or court orders. Rather than fixing the duties of magistrate judges nationwide, the Federal Magistrates Act allows each district court to assign duties to the magistrate judges as fits the needs of that court. In criminal proceedings, magistrate judges preside over misdemeanor and petty offense cases, and as to all criminal cases (felony and misdemeanor) may issue search warrants, arrest warrants, and summonses, accept criminal complaints, conduct initial appearance proceedings and detention hearings, set bail or other conditions of release or detention, hold preliminary hearings and examinations, administer oaths, conduct extradition proceedings, and conduct evidentiary hearings on motions to suppress evidence in felony cases for issuance of reports and recommendations to the district judge. The Supreme Court has held in Peretz v. United States that magistrate judges may supervise the jury selection in a felony trial unless a party objects.Peretz v. United States, 501 U.S. 923 (1991) (Magistrates may supervise jury selection for a felony trial with consent of the parties). In civil proceedings, magistrate judges typically manage discovery and other pretrial matters. They are authorized to issue orders in pretrial matters as long as the order is not dispositive of the case as a whole (for example, an order granting summary judgment is not within purview). They may also be assigned to write reports and recommendations to the district judge as to dispositive matters. With the consent of the parties, they may adjudicate civil cases in the same manner as a district judge, including presiding over jury or non-jury trials. Assignment Normally, a newly filed federal action is assigned by the clerk of the district court to a district judge and a magistrate judge (whose initials are then appended to the case number in most districts). In some districts, magistrates judges are assigned to work with certain district judges, although they may not do so on all categories of cases. In other districts, magistrate judges are randomly assigned to cases. The clerk runs a random selection procedure (in some courts, spinning a wheel) based on a list of all available district judges and then runs the same procedure based on a list of all available magistrate judges. In a few districts, starting with the District of Oregon in 1984, magistrate judges participate together with district judges on a unified list of judges available for new cases. A newly filed case can then be assigned to a magistrate judge for all purposes, subject to the ability of any party in the action to affirmatively decline consent to that procedure within a certain time period. Filing of such a declination causes the magistrate judge to return the case to the court clerk for a standard assignment to a district-magistrate pair. Review by an Article III tribunal Because Article III of the United States Constitution vests the judicial powers in courts to which the judges are appointed for life (and which are therefore called Article III tribunals), decisions of a magistrate judge are subject to review and either approval, modification or reversal by a district judge of that court - except in civil cases where the parties consent in advance to allow the magistrate judge to exercise the jurisdiction of the district judge, and in which case appeals from the decision of the magistrate judge are heard by the United States Court of Appeals. The magistrate judges therefore operate under the authority of Congress to appoint \\"inferior courts\\", set forth in Article I, making them Article I judges. Tim A. Baker, \\"The Expanding Role of Magistrate Judges in the Federal Courts\\", Valparaiso University Law Review, http://scholar.valpo.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1248&context;=vulr The Supreme Court most thoroughly delineated the permissible scope of Article I tribunals in Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co.,Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. 50 (1982). striking down the statute that created the original U.S. bankruptcy court. The Court noted in that opinion that the framers of the Constitution had developed a scheme of separation of powers which clearly required that the judicial branch be kept independent of the other two branches via the mechanism of lifetime appointments. However, the Court also found that Congress has the power under Article I to create adjunct tribunals, so long as the \\"essential attributes of judicial power\\" stay in Article III courts. This power derives from two sources. First, when Congress creates rights, it can require those asserting such rights to go through an Article I tribunal. Second, Congress can create non-Article III tribunals to help Article III courts deal with their workload, but only if the Article I tribunals are under the control of the Article III courts. Tim A. Baker, \\"The Expanding Role of Magistrate Judges in the Federal Courts\\", Valparaiso University Law Review, http://scholar.valpo.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1248&context;=vulr The Supreme Court later noted, in Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Schor,Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833 (1986). that parties to litigation could voluntarily waive their right to an Article III tribunal, and thereby submit themselves to a binding judgment from an Article I tribunal. History The office of United States magistrate judge was established by the Federal Magistrates Act of 1968., (1968), codified as amended at , -, and Its foundation is the United States commissioner system, established in 1793. Commissioners were previously used in federal courts to try petty offense cases committed on federal property, to issue search warrants and arrest warrants, to determine bail for federal defendants and to conduct other initial proceedings in federal criminal cases. The Federal Magistrates Act of 1968, as amended, was enacted by the Congress to create a new federal judicial officer who would (1) assume all the former duties of the commissioners and (2) conduct a wide range of judicial proceedings to expedite the disposition of the civil and criminal caseloads of the United States district courts. In 1979, Congress expanded federal magistrates' authority to include all misdemeanors recognized by the federal criminal code. Magistrates' titles changed again in 1990, when they became \\"magistrate judges,\\" symbolizing the ever-increasing importance of their work. One view is that the system has worked relatively well in the last 30 years, and has tended to shift the federal courts' caseload to the desired balance. Other legal observers have criticized the increasing powers of magistrate judges, who are neither appointed by the President nor confirmed by the Senate. On the other hand, the selection of a magistrate judge is a merit-based process which, by statute, requires public notice of a vacancy and the appointment of a merit selection panel which includes both lawyers and at least two non-lawyers. The panel is required to consider the attributes of each candidate, including scholarship, experience, knowledge of the court system, and personal attributes such as intelligence, honesty and morality, maturity, demeanor, temperament, and ability to work with others. Applicants for the post must be personally interviewed and recommended for the position. Magistrate judges are compensated at a slightly lower scale than district judges and do not benefit from the full array of benefits accorded to district judges, so increased magistrate judge involvement in judicial matters has a cost-savings effect for the federal courts. State courts A number of states have judges titled as magistrates. These positions are unrelated to the federal office, and function according to the laws of the specific state.

After the 1980 coup, he was arrested and sentenced to 16 years in prison for his role in shootings, bombings, and a murder. In 1986, he was charged with a further five murders and began cooperating with Turkish intelligence, being released in 1989. He was assassinated on the orders of his former business partner Alaattin Çakıcı. Background His parents were Yaşar and Ayşe. Ağansoy was a member of the Çağlayan, Kağıthane branch of the Nationalist Movement Party in the 1970s, and knew Alaattin Çakıcı as a leader of a neighbouring branch.Hurriyet Daily News, 6 September 1996, Mafia or Banana -or a Republic at all? Imprisonment Prior to 1980 Turkish coup d'etat, he was arrested by the Military Court No. 1 on May 20, 1979 on allegations of his involvement in killing and wounding persons and various bombings in Şişli and Gültepe in İstanbul. However, the court decided to release him pending trial, and he was acquitted subsequently. He was arrested on July 10, 1981, as one of the persons involved in the killing of Zafer Ereske in 1980. He was convicted on January 29, 1981, for planting bombs and carrying a gun without license. During the period he served in Metris Prison in Istanbul, he handed in a petition on April 24, 1988, requesting to benefit from the Repentance Law. Release He was released in 1989, and began working together with Çakıcı. He fell out with Çakıcı over the shooting of Engin Civan, as his name became associated with the shooting (Civangate) and he had to flee abroad. He was captured in Germany with the assistance of Interpol. At his trial Uğur Kılıç, Çakıcı's wife and the daughter of Dündar Kılıç, was due to testify, but Çakıcı had her murdered first. Ağansoy declared he would get revenge for this murder, whereupon Çakıcı announced that Ağansoy would be dead within two months. An attempt to assassinate Ağansoy at the April 3, 1996, court hearing at which he was released was narrowly foiled. Assassination On August 28, 1996, while he was sitting in a cafe in the Bebek neighborhood of Istanbul with Celal Babür and Ferda Temel (the police officers in charge of protecting Prime Minister Tansu Çiller), he was targeted by assassins arriving by car. Ağansoy was shot dead along with Babür in an attack carried out by hitmen hired by Alaattin Çakıcı.

In 1960, Sud Aviation acquired from Gardan a licence to build the design. The prototype first flew on 21 July 1960 and the aircraft was initially produced by Sud Aviation at Nantes and Rochefort. Sud Aviation later acquired the bankrupt Morane-Saulnier aircraft company, and in 1966, formed the subsidiary SOCATA to continue production of the Morane-Saulnier Rallye; however, Sud Aviation soon transferred production of its other general aviation aircraft to SOCATA as well. Sud-Aviation and its SOCATA subsidiary manufactured 267 units by the end of 1969, when production was terminated. The all-metal design has a low- mounted cantilever wing with four mechanically operated Fowler-type trailing- edge flaps and two Frise-type ailerons. The tricycle landing gear partially retracts, with all wheels retracting rearwards. (A little more than half of each wheel remains exposed in the retracted position). The first prototype used a Avco Lycoming O-320 flat air-cooled engine driving a fixed-pitch metal propeller, with production aircraft using this engine or a version of the O-320, and had an option to use a constant speed propeller. By 1966, a Lycoming O-360 engine was available., and the 150 hp option was removed by 1967. Most Horizons were bought by French pilot owners, but examples were exported to several countries including Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom and numbers remain in service in 2014. An improved variant was developed originally as the Super Horizon 200 and later went into production as the ST 10 Diplomate.

C. Cureton, was an American clergyman and civil rights activist. Early life He was born to Santee Argo Cureton and Martha Arrye Henderson Cureton. He is the sixth child of seven. He was educated in the Greenville County school system, graduating from Sterling High School in 1949. Having already accepted God's call to preach at the age of seventeen, he continued his education at Benedict College, Columbia, South Carolina, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1953. Ministerial life in South Carolina Cureton modeled his belief that an effective leader needs both a \\"baptized heart and a baptized brain\\", and through the years continued his education by studying at numerous other colleges and universities throughout North Carolina and South Carolina. He was awarded the Doctor of Divinity degree from Morris College, Sumter, South Carolina and Benedict College, Columbia, South Carolina. He began his pastorate in 1953 as pastor of Old Pilgrim Baptist Church, Greenville, South Carolina: New Galilee Baptist Church, Walhala, South Carolina; Rock Hill Baptist Church #2, Greenville, South Carolina; Griffin Ebenezer Baptist Church, Pickens, South Carolina and Gethsemane Baptist Church, Chester, South Carolina. In 1965 he was called to pastor Reedy Fork Baptist Church and Reedy River Baptist Church which was his home church. In 1978 he became the full-time pastor of Reedy River Baptist Church. Under his leadership the membership and influence of Reedy River Baptist Church grew exponentially. He led the membership to build two new sanctuaries and a family life center that became the model for many other churches in the Greenville area. Cureton was committed to education, understanding that it is only through education that people can reach their full potential. National leadership in ministry Cureton rose from humble beginnings to become a local, state and national leader. Among his many accomplishments: served as moderator of the Reedy River Baptist Association; served as president of the Baptist Educational & Missionary Convention of South Carolina (1986–1991); served as second vice president, vice president-at-large and president of the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc; appointed as a commission member of the United States Presidential Scholars Program by President Bill Clinton (1991–2000); awarded the Order of the Palmetto Award; served as member of the Benedict College Board of Trustees; served as member of the Morris College Board of Trustees. He was president of the National Baptist Convention from March 1999 to September 1999. Cureton, then vice president-at-large, took over the leadership of the convention when his predecessor Henry Lyons was forced to resign. He served the remainder of Lyons' tenure. Teaching career Cureton, a former math teacher at Sterling High School and Beck High School, was pastor of Reedy River Missionary Baptist Church in South Carolina at the time of his death. He was an advocate on state issues such as the establishment of a holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr. in Greenville County. Cureton was instrumental in bringing King to Greenville for a speech in April 1967. Cureton was out front in integrating the public libraries in Greenville County, South Carolina. Personal life On December 27, 1954, Cureton married the love of his life, Claudette Hazel Chapman Cureton. From their union four children were born: Ruthye, Stewart Jr., Santee Charles, and Samuel. Samuel followed his father into the ministry. He died on December 30, 2008, aged 78.

F., 2012, Dinosaurs, the Encyclopedia, Supplement 7: McFarland & Company, Inc, 866pp. At the time of its discovery, it was the oldest-known ceratopsid, and first centrosaurine known from latitudes south of the U.S. state of Montana. The generic name Diabloceratops means \\"devil-horned face,\\" coming from Diablo, Spanish for \\"devil,\\" and ceratops, Latinized Greek for \\"horned face.\\" The specific name honors Jeffrey Eaton, a paleontologist at Weber State University and long time friend of the lead author Jim Kirkland. Eaton had a big role in establishing the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument where the specimen was found. The type species, Diabloceratops eatoni, was named and described in 2010 by James Ian Kirkland and Donald DeBlieux. Discovery The only two specimens of Diabloceratops eatoni were recovered at the Wahweap Formation, in Kane County, Utah. Type specimen UMNH VP 16699 was collected by Don DeBlieux in 2002, at the Last Chance Creek locality of this formation, in intraclastic sandstone that was deposited during the Campanian stage of the Cretaceous period, approximately 81 to 76 million years ago.J. I. Kirkland and D. D. DeBlieux. 2007. New horned dinosaurs from the Wahweap Formation, Grand Staircase- Escalante National Monument, southern Utah. Utah Geological Survey Notes 39(3):4-5 It consists of a partial skull with a piece of the lower jaw, with the right side being intact and part of the left side, which has been weathered. Another specimen UMNH VP 16704 was discovered years earlier in 1998 by Joshua A. Smith of the same formation, but was not described until 2010, when it was assigned to Diabloceratops. These specimens are housed in the collection of the Natural History Museum of Utah. Description Restoration Diabloceratops was built like a typical ceratopsian in that it had a large neck frill made of bone. It had a small horn on the nose, perhaps a second horn in front of that, and a pair of relatively small horns above the eyes. The skull is deeper and shorter than that of any other centrosaurines. Upon the frill it also had a pair of very long spikes as in Einiosaurus and Styracosaurus. It being one of the earliest centrosaurine ceratopsids, Kirkland noted a character Diabloceratops shared with the more \\"primitive\\" protoceratopsid forms. Both possess an accessory opening in the skull that would become much reduced or disappear in later, more advanced ceratopsids. Kirkland saw this as an indication that the earlier species were not together included in some single natural group but instead presented a gradual sequence of ever more derived forms, increasingly closer related to the Ceratopsidae.

The area where dinosaurs lived included lakes, floodplains, and east-flowing rivers. The Wahweap Formation is part of the Grand Staircase region, an immense sequence of sedimentary rock layers that stretch south from Bryce Canyon National Park through Zion National Park and into the Grand Canyon. The presence of rapid sedimentation and other evidence suggests a wet, seasonal climate.Zubair A.

He was a prominent member of the Istanbul Bar Association, and was known for having support from both Kurds and Turks from different political viewpoints. He represented many Kurdish and Turkish political and business figureheads, including Behçet Cantürk, who was also assassinated in 1994. Early life and education Serhat was born in Iğdır (then part of Kars Province) to İsa and Bahar Serhat. He graduated from the Faculty of Law at Istanbul University. Career He was imprisoned for 13 months in 1959 before being released. When the Supreme Court quashed the verdict, he was sentenced in a re-trial to 10 months and 20 days in prison. The case related to a group of university students having Kurdish identity, and going through their higher education with Kurdish identity instead of assimilating to a Turkish identity. The court described the students as \\"Kurdish Communists\\", an accusation used frequently by the Turkish state during the Cold War era. The case was known as 49lar (English: 49ers) as there were 49 suspects. Serhat was prosecuted without arrest in 1963, accused of having disseminated Kurdish propaganda in the journal Denge, which he published in Istanbul. In 1965, he was sentenced to 1 year 4 months in prison for establishing a Kurdish organization. In 1975, he was elected Principal Member of Discipline Committee of Board of Directors of Istanbul Bar Association from Çağdaş Avukatlar Grubu (Modern Lawyers Group). In 1977, he attended the International Lawyers Meeting in Zagreb, Yugoslavia. In 1978, he was elected Istanbul Representative of \\"İttihad-i Vatani Kürdistan\\" (Union of the Kurdish Nation) which was active abroad parallel to Jalal Talabani. Serhat was a candidate for Kars from the list of the Republican People's Party (CHP) in the local elections held in 1979. In 1980, he joined the Communist Party of Turkey (TKP) as a provisional member. He was detained on 27 January 1981 on charges of disseminating communist and Kurdish propaganda and was released on 29 January. In 1982, he joined the defence in a Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) trial launched in Erzurum, as well as trials in Istanbul and Diyarbakir. In the same year, he was arrested for membership of the Executive Board of the Peace Association, and released in November 1983. In 1984, he acted as the lawyer of Behçet Cantürk, who was involved in drug trafficking, for one case only. Serhat was among the founding members of the Kurdish Rights and Freedoms Foundation, established in İstanbul in 1990 with the aim of establishing the Kurdish National Union, and in this respect establishing a national assembly and a Kurdish political party on a legal platform. In 1991, he had clients among the defendants of the \\"Peace Committee Association\\" trial. He was a signatory to the declaration of the \\"Call for the Democracy Assembly\\", written during the General Assembly of the Democracy Party (DEP) held in Ankara on 18 and 19 December 1993. He was also one of the defence lawyers for MPs from the defunct Democracy Party (DEP) in the trial launched against them at Ankara SSC in October 1994. Assassination He was killed along with his driver outside his house in Erenköy, İstanbul, on 12 November 1994. His wife was shot 14 times but survived. In her statements she was unable to give any details about the attackers face, until she saw Nurullah Tevfik Agansoy on television. Medet Serhat's murder was declared an extrajudicial killing, and is still unsolved. The murder had a huge impact, with approximately 5,000 people both Turkish and Kurdish marching at his funeral. His colleagues from the Istanbul Bar Association attended with their courthouse robes. His name was mentioned as a murder organized by the deep state in the Susurluk Scandal, and in 2010 his family asked to be officially listed as victims of the Ergenekon following confessions made by the organization members.Zaman, 7 October 2010, Medet Serhat'ın ailesi, cinayet dosyasının Ergenekon'la birleştirilmesini istiyor Haberturk, 7 October 2010, \\"Medet Serhat cinayeti Ergenekon'la birleşsin\\"Taraf, 17 November 2010, Katili ekranda gördüm  References External links * (contains the Susurluk reports, and material on the Counter-Guerrilla) * Official reports (DOC), hosted by Can Dündar.

The probe in a scanning thermal microscope is sensitive to local temperatures – providing a nano-scale thermometer. Thermal measurements at the nanometer scale are of both scientific and industrial interest. Applications SThM allows thermal measurements at the nano-scale. These measurements can include: temperature, thermal properties of materials, thermal conductivity, heat capacity, glass transition temperature, latent heat, enthalpy, etc. The applications include: *Ultra large-scale integration (ULSI) lithography research and cellular diagnostics in biochemistry. *Detecting such parameters as phase changes in polymer blends. *Joule heating *Measuring material variations in semiconductor devices *Subsurface imaging *Near-field photo thermal micro-spectroscopy *Data storage *Calorimetry applicationsLee, J-H. et al.

Williams and H. Kumar Wickramasinghe in 1986. Technique SThM requires the use of specialized probes. There are two types of thermal probes: Thermocouple probes where the probe temperature is monitored by a thermocouple junction at the probe tip and resistive or bolometer probes where the probe temperature is monitored by a thin-film resistor at probe tip. These probes are generally made from thin dielectric films on a silicon substrate and use a metal or semiconductor film bolometer to sense the tip temperature. Other approaches, using more involved micro machining methods, have also been reported. In a bolometer probe the resistor is used as a local heater and the fractional change in probe resistance is used to detect the temperature and/or the thermal conductance of the sample. When the tip is placed in contact with the sample, heat flows from the tip to sample. As the probe is scanned, the amount of heat flow changes. By monitoring the heat flow, one can create a thermal map of the sample, revealing spatial variations in thermal conductivity in a sample. Through a calibration process, the SThM can reveal the quantitative values of thermal conductivity. Alternately the sample may be actively heated, for example a powered circuit, to visualize the distribution of temperatures on the sample. Tip-sample heat transfer can include * Solid-solid conduction. Probe tip to sample. This is the transfer mechanism which yields the thermal scan. * Liquid-liquid conduction. When scanning in non-zero humidity, a liquid meniscus forms between the tip and sample. Conduction can occur through this liquid drop. * Gas conduction. Heat can be transferred through the edges of the probe tip to the sample.

In microscopy, an artifact is an apparent structural detail that is caused by the processing of the specimen and is thus not a legitimate feature of the specimen. In light microscopy, artifacts may be produced by air bubbles trapped under the slide's cover slip. In electron microscopy, distortions may be produced in the drying out of the specimen. Staining can cause the appearance of solid chemical deposits that may be seen as structures inside the cell. Different techniques including freeze-fracturing and cell fractionation may be used to overcome the problems of artifacts. A crush artifact is an artificial elongation and distortion seen in histopathology and cytopathology studies, presumably because of iatrogenic compression of tissues. Distortion can be caused by the slightest compression of tissue and can provide difficulties in diagnosis. It may cause chromatin to be squeezed out of nuclei. Inflammatory and tumor cells are most susceptible to crush artifacts.

Constructed at the turn of the twentieth century, the Conover features a mix of architectural styles and sits at a prominent intersection, and it has been named a historic site.

Its overall design mixes elements from multiple sub-styles of Neo-Renaissance architecture, in addition to occasional Neoclassical details and themes. The architect was Frank Mills Andrews, whose work gained him fame throughout the United States. Erected just eight years after Dayton's first skyscraper,Drury, A.W. History of the City of Dayton and Montgomery County, Ohio. Vol. 1. Chicago and Dayton: Clarke, 1900, 182. the Conover Building stands thirteen stories tall. Its bottom four stories retain a typical commercial design, featuring an arcade, and Baroque styling appears on the top three stories, while the plainer six stories in the middle are distinguished by trabeating at their summit. Situated on the southeastern corner of Third and Main Streets, it lies near the United Brethren Publishing House, the Commercial Building, and the Dayton Arcade. History The site of the Conover Building has been used for commercial purposes for more than two centuries, beginning with the opening of a blacksmith shop by New Jersey native Obadiah Conover in 1811. The present structure was erected on the site in 1900, and within a few years of its construction, it was recognized as one of Dayton's most prominent office towers; during the Miami River flood of 1913, when the Miami and Mad Rivers broke their dikes and flash-flooded the downtown, many pedestrians took refuge in the Conover Building's upper stories.Davis, Lee. Natural Disasters. New York: Facts on File, 192. Nearly a century later, by which time the Conover had also attracted the name of \\"American Building\\", it became viewed as Dayton's most dangerous intersection: repeated incidents of crime at the adjacent central bus station led local media to deem the junction of Third and Main the \\"Corner of Chaos\\". Crime efforts have since fallen substantially, due to a reorganization of the city's bus hub and the restructuring of various other components in the area's built environment.Faulkner, Larry. \\"Dayton Brings Order to 'Corner of Chaos' \\". COPS, 2010-12. Accessed 2013-11-10. In 1975, the Conover Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its distinctive historic architecture. It qualified for inclusion partly because of its place in the entire city's skyline, in addition to its place as a prominent example of Frank Andrews' designs.

Hao, P. Ryan. Password Authenticated Key Exchange by Juggling. Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Security Protocols, 2008. This protocol allows two parties to establish private and authenticated communication solely based on their shared (low-entropy) password without requiring a Public Key Infrastructure. It provides mutual authentication to the key exchange, a feature that is lacking in the Diffie–Hellman key exchange protocol. Description Two parties, Alice and Bob, agree on a group G with generator g of prime order q in which the discrete log problem is hard. Typically a Schnorr group is used. In general, J-PAKE can use any prime order group that is suitable for public key cryptography, including Elliptic curve cryptography. Let s be their shared (low-entropy) secret, which can be a password or a hash of a password (s eq 0). The protocol executes in two rounds. ;Round 1: Alice selects x_1 \\\\in_R [0, q-1], x_2 \\\\in_R [1, q-1] and sends out g^{x_1}, g^{x_2} together with the Zero-knowledge proofs (using for example Schnorr non-interactive zero-knowledge proof as specified in RFC 8235) for the proof of the exponents x_1 and x_2. Similarly, Bob selects x_3 \\\\in_R [0, q-1], x_4 \\\\in_R [1, q-1] and sends out g^{x_3}, g^{x_4} together with the Zero-knowledge proofs for the proof of the exponents x_3 and x_4. The above communication can be completed in one round as neither party depends on the other. When it finishes, Alice and Bob verify the received Zero-knowledge proofs and also check g^{x_2}, g^{x_4} eq 1. ;Round 2: Alice sends out A = g^{(x_1 + x_3 + x_4) x_2 s} and a Zero-knowledge proof for the proof of the exponent x_2 s. (Note Alice actually derives a new public key using g^{x_1 + x_3 + x_4} as the generator). Similarly, Bob sends out B = g^{(x_1 + x_2 + x_3) x_4 s} and a Zero-knowledge proof for the proof of the exponent x_4 s. After Round 2, Alice computes K = (B/g^{x_2 x_4 s})^{x_2} = g^{(x_1 + x_3) x_2 x_4 s}. Similarly, Bob computes K = (A/g^{x_2 x_4 s})^ {x_4} = g^{(x_1 + x_3) x_2 x_4 s}. With the same keying material K, Alice and Bob can derive a session key using a Cryptographic hash function: \\\\kappa = H(K). The two-round J-PAKE protocol is completely symmetric. This helps significantly simplify the security analysis. For example, the proof that one party does not leak any password information in the data exchange must hold true for the other party based on the symmetry. This reduces the number of the needed security proofs by half. In practice, it is more likely to implement J-PAKE in three flows since one party shall normally take the initiative. This can be done trivially without loss of security. Suppose Alice initiates the communication by sending to Bob: g^{x_1}, g^{x_2} and Zero-knowledge proofs. Then Bob replies with: g^{x_3}, g^{x_4}, B = g^{(x_1 + x_2 + x_3) x_4 s} and Zero-knowledge proofs. Finally, Alice sends to Bob: A = g^{(x_1 + x_3 + x_4) x_2 s} and a Zero- knowledge proof. Both parties can now derive the same session key. Depending on the application requirement, Alice and Bob may perform an optional key confirmation step. There are several ways to do it. A simple method described in SPEKE works as follows: Alice sends to Bob H(H(\\\\kappa)), and then Bob replies with H(\\\\kappa). Alternatively, Alice and Bob can realize explicit key confirmation by using the newly constructed session key to encrypt a known value (or a random challenge). EKE, Kerberos and Needham-Schroeder all attempt to provide explicit key confirmation by exactly this method. Security properties Given that the underlying Schnorr non-interactive zero-knowledge proof is secure, the J-PAKE protocol is proved to satisfy the following properties:F. Hao, P. Ryan. J-PAKE: Authenticated Key Exchange Without PKI. Springer Transactions on Computational Science XI, Special Issue on Security in Computing, Part II, Vol. 6480, pp. 192-206, 2010. # Off-line dictionary attack resistance - It does not leak any password verification information to a passive/active attacker. # Forward secrecy - It produces session keys that remain secure even when the password is later disclosed. # Known-key security - It prevents a disclosed session key from affecting the security of other sessions. # On-line dictionary attack resistance - It limits an active attacker to test only one password per protocol execution. In 2015, Abdalla, Benhamouda and MacKenzie conducted an independent formal analysis of J-PAKE to prove its security in a random oracle model assuming algebraic adversaries.M. Abdalla, F. Benhamouda, P. MacKenzie Security of the J-PAKE Password- Authenticated Key Exchange Protocol. The protocol design The J-PAKE protocol is designed by combining random public keys in such a structured way to achieve a vanishing effect if both parties supplied exactly the same passwords. This is somehow similar to the Anonymous veto network protocol design. The essence of the idea, however, can be traced back to David Chaum's original Dining Cryptographers network protocol,David Chaum. The Dining Cryptographers Problem: Unconditional Sender and Recipient Untraceability Journal of Cryptology, vol. 1, No, 1, pp. 65-75, 1988 where binary bits are combined in a structured way to achieve a vanishing effect. The implementation J-PAKE has been implemented in OpenSSL and OpenSSH as an experimental authentication protocol. It was removed from the OpenSSH source code at the end of January 2014.OpenBSD CVS log for src/usr.bin/ssh/Attic/jpake.c It has also been implemented in NSS and was used by Firefox Sync version 1.1 but discontinued in 1.5 which uses a different key exchange and storage method. Mozilla's J-PAKE server was shut down along with the Sync 1.1 storage servers on 30 September 2015. Pale Moon continues to use J-PAKE as part of its Sync service. Since February 2013, J-PAKE has been added to the lightweight API in Bouncycastle (1.48 and onwards). J-PAKE is also used in the Thread (network protocol)http://threadgroup.org/Portals/0/documents/whitepapers/Thread%20Commissioning%20white%20paper_v2_public.pdf Standardization J-PAKE has been included in ISO/IEC 11770-4 (2017) as an international standard.https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:67933:en It is also published in RFC 8236.

The first part of the atlas contains copper plate prints depicting the world systems of Claudius Ptolemy, Nicolaus Copernicus, and Tycho Brahe. At the end are star maps of the classical and further constellations, the latter ones as introduced by Julius Schiller in his Coelum stellatum christianum of 1627. For its importance in the history of celestial cartography, the Harmonia Macrocosmica is considered as one of the notable masterworks from the Golden Age of Dutch/Netherlandish cartography (c. 1570s–1670s), along with Abraham Ortelius's Theatrum Orbis Terrarum and Johannes Blaeu's Atlas Maior. It is often described as the most beautiful celestial atlas ever published.  History  In the foreword to his Chronologica, Gerard Mercator stated the intention to publish an atlas which would cover everything of the then-known cosmos, geography and history of the earth. During his life, Mercator published five volumes of his atlas, the last one being published by his son Rumold. After Mercator's death, the Amsterdam cartographer Johannes Janssonius took over the project. He and fellow- cartographer Hendricus Hondius published their Novus Atlas in 1636, which featured over 320 maps in four languages. In 1660, Andreas Cellarius' Harmonia Macrocosmica was published as the seventh volume of the project. With the final addition of a volume describing the cities of the world from 1657, the project was finally completed.  Origins of the engravings  Of the various engravers and authors who worked on the plates of the atlas, only two have signed their work. The frontispiece of the atlas was created by Frederik Hendrik van den Hove and ten other plates were engraved by Johannes van Loon. Moreover, all the designs of the classical constellations were taken from the ones created by Jan Pieterszoon Saenredam.

Biography He was born in Lice to Kamil Ekinci. In June 1963 he was a student of the Faculty of Law at Ankara University and he was known as a socialist Kurdish nationalist in the school. He was among the members of the youth organization of the Workers Party of Turkey (TİP) which started its activities in Ankara in December 1963, and he worked as the editor-in-chief of the newspaper Emekçi (the Laborer), which was the publication of the Party. Following his graduation he went to Diyarbakır in April 1969 to do his compulsory practice, and he participated in the rally held here in protest to the draft bill of the Law to Protect the Constitution. During the period of his arrest in 1970 and 1971, he was put on trial on charges of carrying out activities within the Revolutionary East Culture Centers (DDKD).

He emphasized the student's role in learning and believed that unless students are intrinsically motivated to learn, their musical growth will be minimal at best. In Mursell's view the best motivator is the active, participatory musical experience—singing, playing, listening and being actively involved with good music. This is the all-important starting point for motivation, and it is from these experiences that musical growth can occur. He applies his \\"synthesis-analysis-synthesis\\" (or whole- part-whole) pattern of learning to music education, and speaks of musical understanding as \\"unfolding or evolving, rather than adding or accumulating.\\" Instead of teaching the rudiments of music in isolation from the context that gives them meaning, Mursell suggests that factual knowledge about music will gradually be gleaned from songs that students have learned and enjoy singing. Each time they sing a particular song, they do something different with it and learn a little more about it. In this way their understanding of melody, rhythm and dynamics deepens gradually as an outgrowth of meaningful music- making, rather than drill and practice. At the end of each such activity, when students sing the song through once more it means more to them that it did prior to their \\"analysis\\" of it. Publications Mursell's The Psychology of School Music Teaching (with Kansas City music supervisor Mabelle Glenn) and Human Values and Music Education (both published in the 1930s) became standard texts. \\"Principles of Music Education\\" appeared as the opening chapter in the 1936 yearbook of the National Society for the Study of Education, and Mursell was also a contributing author to the 1958 yearbook Basic Concepts in Music Education. In 1955 he published Principles of Democratic Education.In addition, his seminal book Music in American Schools was published in 1943 during World War II. References *Labuta, J.A. and Smith, D.A.

The team was led by Jim Tatum in his first and only season as head coach. Along with first-year backfield coach Bud Wilkinson, who became the head coach himself the following year, Tatum installed the new split-T offense. An intensive recruiting effort, largely focused at veterans returning from the Second World War, helped Oklahoma to on-field success and eight of the team's new recruits eventually earned first-team All-America honors. The team improved from the previous season to an 8–3 record and a share of the Big Six Conference championship. Recruiting Tatum launched an intensive recruiting drive that included open tryouts that attracted an estimated 600 prospects. He largely rejected the players from the previous season and focused instead on building a new team. The recruiting effort targeted returning servicemen who had been athletes at other colleges before the war, rival universities, and graduating high school seniors.Head Coaches , University of Oklahoma, April 28, 2009. Tatum's recruiting paid dividends, and nine of his players would earn All- American honors at Oklahoma: Plato Andros, Buddy Burris, Jack Mitchell, Jim Owens, John Rapacz, Darrell Royal, George Thomas, Wade Walker, and Stan West.

At the conclusion of the 1945 season, Luster tendered his resignation. Athletic director Jap Haskell recommended Jim Tatum to University of Oklahoma president George Cross, and other applicants considered by the Board of Regents included Bear Bryant and Harold Drew. Haskell had served in the U.S. Navy during the war, and Tatum was an assistant coach for the Navy's Iowa Pre-Flight School football team under head coach Don Faurot, the inventor of the split-T formation. Prior to that, Tatum had coached at his own alma mater, North Carolina. Bud Wilkinson, who had been a colleague of Tatum's at Iowa Pre-Flight, was hired as Oklahoma's new backfield coach.Gary King, The Forgotten Man of Oklahoma Football: Jim Tatum , Sooner Magazine, University of Oklahoma Foundation, Inc., Spring 2008. Walter Driskill, the former line coach at Colorado and Wyoming, was given that same role at Oklahoma. Tatum and Wilkinson installed the split-T, the innovative new offensive system they had learned under Don Faurot during the war.

During the game, Oklahoma recorded 195 rushing and 74 passing yards, while NC State compiled 136 rushing and 103 passing yards. Sooners' halfback Joe Golding rushed for 91 yards on 12 attempts and was named the most valuable player.Historical Box Scores: 2nd Annual Gator Bowl, Gator Bowl Association, retrieved June 11, 2009. Archived 2009-06-15. Postseason Individual honors were bestowed upon several Oklahoma players, and at the time, the 1946 team included the most all- conference honorees to date. First-team All-American honors were granted to guards Plato Andros and Buddy Burris, and center John Rapacz. The All-Big Six first team included those three as well as end Warren Giese, back Joe Golding, and tackles Homer Paine and Wade Walker. After the Gator Bowl, university president Cross learned that Tatum had paid each player $120 ($, adjusted for inflation), despite Cross's order not to do so. He later learned that $60,000 ($ in inflation-adjusted terms) was unaccounted for in the athletic department budget. As a result, athletic director Jap Haskell was fired. Tatum accepted an offer to coach at Maryland, and Cross promoted Bud Wilkinson into the head coaching position.

His main activity was involvement in the illegal drug trade. 1970s Behçet's father was named Reşit. Starting in 1975, Cantürk became a partner of some smugglers by providing money for them. In 1975, he participated in organizing the protest rally in Lice, Diyarbakır held by the Progressive Youth Association (İGD) and financially supported the rally. In the same year, he received a medical report through bribes from Konya Military Hospital certifying that he was not suitable for military service. In 1977 he started arms trafficking. 1980s Between 1981 and 1983, he was involved in the smuggling of gold and diamonds with the help of jewelers of Armenian and Syriac origin in the Grand Bazaar of İstanbul. In 1983, when Dündar Kılıç and İsmail Hacısüleymanoğlu started to put pressure on the non-Muslim and Diyarbakır-born jewelers in the Grand Bazaar in order to take control of gold and diamonds smuggling, he organized the bombing and an armed attack carried out by ASALA in the Grand Bazaar. As of 1983, he was controlling the heroin market in Diyarbakır and sale of heroin abroad. On June 22, 1984, he was arrested by the Military Court in Ankara for membership of the Kurdistan Workers Party and the Kurdistan Avantguard Workers Party. 1990s He and Hüseyin Baybaşin were partners in the smuggling of 3 tons of drug on the ship MV Kısmetim 1 that sunk in the Mediterranean end of December 1992. In April 1992, along with a person named Iranian Hüsno, he brought 6 tons of morphine base and 5 tons of marijuana from Pakistan. While distributing the drugs, he chose smugglers, who supported the PKK financially. On various dates, he collected money in the name of the PKK from drug smugglers named Savaş Buldan, Hüseyin Erez, Hasan Erez, Cahit Kocakaya and Eyüp Kocakaya. But it was later announced that he only paid money to PKK and PKK had no relation to any drug deals. After the Ergenekon trials, some information was revealed that the Tansu Çiller government had supplied Canturk with a military helicopter to move drugs from East Turkey to West Turkey. He was abducted by Turkish mobsters dressed like police on 14 January 1994, and his corpse was found the next day in the vicinity of Sapanca.

In the following years, when married to Mary Deeble, Burthogge published several other works on religious subjects and two further philosophical works, both dedicated to John Locke: An Essay upon Reason, and the Nature of Spirits (1694) and Of the Soul of the World; and of Particular Souls (1699). Mary Deeble probably died in 1695. His daughters Sarah, Mary and Ann originated from these first two marriages. Ann Burthogge, who predeceased her father, left a young son, Richard Babbage, ancestor of the computer pioneer Charles Babbage. At the time of his death Burthogge was married to Honour and seems to have lived at Bowden. He died in 1705 and was buried at St. Mary’s church, Totnes, on 24 July 1705.Dictionary of National Biography Opinions In his philosophical and theological writings he was a critic in some respects of John Locke, but generally his supporter, and an advocate of religious toleration. His epistemology was empiricist, and he opposed innate ideas.

He was born in Werben, Prussia, emigrated from Lower Lusatia to the United States, and died at his rural home near Albion, Oklahoma.  Youth  Kosyk began his schooling at the gymnasium in Cottbus in 1867, with the intention of studying theology. He left the gymnasium before graduation in 1873, bringing his study ambitions to a temporary end. Instead, he started working for a Leipzig railroad company, where he wrote his first lyrical texts. These were all written in Lower Sorbian. =Literary activities= Because of problems with his health, Kosyk returned to Werben in 1877. During the following years he made a living as a freelance writer and produced his most important poetic works. From 1880 onwards he was co-editor of the Bramborske nowiny (Brandenburg News). Through his involvement in the revision of the Lower Sorbian church hymnal he made a lasting impact on the Lower Sorbian language. Kosyk maintained contacts with practically all important representatives of Sorbian cultural life: Kito Šwjela, Hajndrich Jordan, Bjarnat Krušwica, Juro Surowin and Alfons Parczewski, as well as Michał Hórnik and Jan Arnošt Smoler. Kosyk was one of the founders of the Lower Sorbian Maśica Serbska, the most important organisation of Lower Sorbian culture. Emigration In October 1883, Kosyk left for Hamburg, from where he sailed to New York City. He travelled by way of Buffalo, New York, to Springfield, Illinois. Here he could fulfill his dreams to study theology, and he enrolled in an orthodox Lutheran theological seminary. In January 1884 however, he transferred to a German seminary in Chicago, Illinois, instead, and continued his studies in a liberal Lutheran direction. Moreover, the students there spoke German instead of English, making it much easier for Mato Kosyk to understand. He completed his studies in 1885 and was ordained in Wellsburg, Iowa, where he worked among German Frisian immigrants. Although Kosyk worked in the United States among German- and Frisian-speaking farmers, he never ceased to write his Sorbian tales and poems during this period. He continued to publish in Sorbian publications. =Temporary return= At the end of 1886 Mato returned to Lower Lusatia when his brother Kito died. It appears his return was made easier because of tensions between the congregation in Wellsburg and himself. After returning, Kosyk endeavoured to have his ordination recognized; he very much wanted to fill a vacancy in Drachhausen near Peitz. His efforts were in vain, however, and he travelled back to the United States in 1887. America In 1887 Kosyk again travelled to the United States, and he would never again return to Europe. He found work as pastor in Nebraska, where until 1907 he worked in several German-language congregations: Ridgeley in Dodge County (1887–1889), Princeton in Lancaster County (1889–1895), Stamford in Harlan County (1896–1899) and Ohiowa in Fillmore County (1899–1907). From autumn 1895 until summer 1896 he was out of work and lived in Roca in Lancaster County. Kosyk married Anna Wher in Princeton in 1890. Anne came from Duzno (formally Hochsburg, now part of Trzemeszno), a village in Kreis Gnesen in the Province of Posen. Kosyk's last position was in El Reno, Oklahoma. He retired in 1913 and moved near Albion, Oklahoma where in 2010, the home he lived in still stood. Only in 1892 did Kosyk pick up poetry and writing again. He also renewed his neglected contacts with Sorbian intellectuals. Bogumił Šwjela wanted to publish an anthology of Kosyk poems, which appeared in 1893. Kosyk would continue to have poems published in the Lausitz until 1898. After the deaths of Kosyk's only son, Juro, (at age 24 after a horse-riding accident) in 1915 and his wife Anna in 1929, Kosyk became increasingly isolated. He eventually married his housekeeper Wilma Filter in 1938. Wilma left Albion a year after Kosyk's death taking his papers with him; these have been deemed lost. During this last period, Kosyk maintained intensive contacts with the young Sorbian writer Mina Witkojc. Heritage Memorial in Werben/Wjerbno Mato Kosyk's work is predominantly lyrical, and includes very little prose. His poems are concentrated around the Christian faith, which Kosyk generally connected to nature in general and Lusatia in particular. The latter is the equivalent of the homeland, of the Heimat, and is contrasted with the foreign. Kosyk identifies this through the Sorbian language, which on the one hand combines beauty and vulnerability and on the other hand has to battle against imminent extinction. Kosyk used both classical form as well as rhyming forms taken from folk culture for his poems. His preference was for the hexameter form. For example, his Serbska swajźba w Błotach (\\"The Sorbian Wedding in the Spreewald\\") consists of nearly 2,000 hexameters. Hexameters are also used in Ten kśicowany (\\"The Crucified\\") and Helestupjenje Jezusa Kristusa (\\"The Descent of Jesus Christ to Hell\\").

Its justification for inclusion is that it is the sole surviving structure associated with Kosyk. As in Kosyk's time, it features beautiful views of the Kiamichi Mountains.

During the English Interregnum, he printed many important documents and propaganda, first in support of Charles I and later of Oliver Cromwell. He also proved a successful (if controversial) master at a number of schools, including the Merchant Taylor's School, Colchester Royal Grammar School and Stamford School, and wrote a number of non-fiction works.  Early life and education  Dugard was born in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, the son of Henry Dugard, a clergyman and schoolmaster, and his wife, Elizabeth Kimberley, on 9 January 1606. Until the age of 17, Dugard was instructed in classical learning at the King's School, Worcester as a King's Scholar. On 13 September 1622 he was inducted into Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, as a pensioner, studying with his uncle Richard Dugard. In 1629 he received a Bachelor of Arts degree and got his Master of Arts four years later. In the intervening years, he was an usher at Oundle School, Northamptonshire.  Early teaching career  Soon after receiving his MA, Dugard was appointed Master of Stamford School in Lincolnshire, where he caused a great deal of controversy by suing the corporate officers for various abuses, including misappropriation of school lands. On 27 July 1637 Dugard was elected Master of the Free School at Colchester, now Colchester Royal Grammar School, and began his duties on 9 September that year. He resigned the care of the school in January 1643, citing \\"the ill treatment he received at the hands of a party in that town\\". He is attributed with the enlargement of the school from nine to sixty-nine boys. The school has had, since 1908, a school house which bears his name. Dugard's wife, Elizabeth Adams, whom he had married before 1631, died about 1640, leaving two children. Their 3 Stamford-born children were Richard Dugard (1631-before 1634), Richard Dugard (1634; attended St John's College, Oxford in 1650) and Thomas Dugard (1635). Dugard married his second wife, Lydia Parker (widow Tyler, of Lombard Street), on 22 March 1641 at All Hallows Stayning in Lombard Street, London. The couple registered six baptisms in London (5 sons and a daughter): William Dugard (1643), John Dugard (1644), Joseph Dugard (1645–1652), Benjamin Dugard (1648), Philanax Dugard (1649) and Lydia Dugard (1650). On 10 May 1644, he was chosen to be the next headmaster of Merchant Taylors' School, London. According to Chambers, the \\"school flourished exceedingly under his influence and management\\". Later life and death Having bought the presses of James Young and established a printing business, Dugard became an official printer to the Commonwealth and Oliver Cromwell, the Lord Protector. Cromwell was duly incensed when Dugard started to print copies of Defensio Regia pro Carolo primo, Claudius Salmasius' defence of Charles I, his bitter opponent in the civil war. Dugard's activities had been uncovered by a parliamentarian spy, Elizabeth Alkin. For showing, as was thought, too great an affection to the royalist cause, on 20 February 1650, he was deprived of his press and equipment, valued at £1000 (£ in today's money), and imprisoned in Newgate.The Merchant-Taylor's School Register, entry for 20 February 1649/50 His wife and six surviving children were turned out of doors. Fortunately, Dugard was released from prison after only a month, perhaps in part due to the influence that Dugard's \\"intimate friend\\" John Milton had over the judge John Bradshaw, or that which Milton and another of Dugard's friends, Sir James Harrington, had over the Council of State. In April 1650, Dugard opened a private school on Peter's Hill, now in the City of London, but in September was restored to his former station as headmaster at the Merchant Taylor's School. There he remained until 1661, when he was dismissed for breaking orders issued by the school, about which he had been given prior warning. These probably related to the low pupil numbers, or for not declaring extracurricular activities such as becoming a member of the Stationers' Company in 1648, principally to edit textbooks. He appealed against his dismissal but to no avail. Finding himself unemployed once more, Dugard opened a private school in Coleman street in July 1661 and by the next March had gathered 193 scholars, \\"so great was his reputation and the fame of his abilities\\". Dugard did not live to expand the school further, however. By 27 November 1662, when he drew up his will, he was \\"sicke and weake in body\\" and died on 3 December 1662, leaving his daughter Lydia, apparently his only surviving child, as his heir and executor; his second wife had predeceased him in 1661. Both were buried at St Lawrence Pountney, London. In his will he left several books, including the register of the Merchant Taylor's School, in which he had documented his thoughts, to the library of Sion College, London.  Political views  frontispiece of the Eikon Basilike, demonstrating its pro-Royalist nature A register Dugard kept of life at the Merchant Taylor's school would appear to demonstrate Royalist tendencies. On the day of the beheading of Charles I, 30 January 1649, he wrote, in Greek, firstly, that he thought that Charles, \\"the best of kings\\", was \\"fallen by the hands of cruel and wicked men\\", and secondly, that he thought Charles was a martyr for the laws of God and of his country. There are also two more Greek verses, similar in meaning, on the day of the burial of Oliver Cromwell's mother in Westminster Abbey: \\"Here lieth the mother of a cursed son who has been the ruin of two kings and of three kingdoms\\". For printing a strongly pro-Royalist book, Defensio regia pro Carolo primo, written by Claudius Salmasius, Dugard was incarcerated at Newgate and dismissed from the school. After his release, however, Dugard started to print propaganda not for the royalists, as he had done before, but for the Parliamentarians. Apparently at the behest of Milton, Dugard took part in an attempt to disrupt royalist literature and introduced a non-genuine chapter (Pamela's Prayer, an extract from Sir Phillip Sydney's Arcadia) into an edition of the Eikon Basilike that he was printing. This is said to have damaged the reputation of the strongly pro-royalist work, and strengthened the parliamentarian cause. Milton was then employed by the Council of State to posthumously reprimand the King for including it. In addition, Dugard printed Milton's response to Salmasius' Defensio regia pro Carolo primo, now known as Defensio pro Populo Anglicano, one of the great works of propaganda of all time. Conversely, Dugard also published Catechesis Ecclesiarum Poloniae et Lithuaniae, a work critical of Luther, Oliver Cromwell and Protestantism, in 1652. The work was seized and publicly burned, yet Dugard escaped further imprisonment, and only had his printing press confiscated once again.  Publications  Dugard was an editor and author of books on rhetoric and language, as well as a publisher of textbooks, other educational, theological, scientific, and political works, and a newspaper. = Printed = In addition to his politically sensitive works, documented above, Dugard also printed a great number of other works. From 1648 to 1661, by the estimation of Leona Rostenberg, some 171 books rolled off his press, including political tracts and works on education, theology, medicine, science, economics, and literature. This included works written by the physicians William Harvey and Francis Glisson and the agriculturist Sir Richard Weston. In 1652, Dugard's publication of the Racovian Catechism, translated in English, was denounced as a \\"blasphemous and scandalous book\\",The Journals of the House of Commons, book 7 (1651–9), pp. 113–14 all copies of which were ordered to be seized and publicly burnt. However, his relations with the government do not seem diminished as he continued to print works praising the policies and victories of the Commonwealth and its army, including, in 1652, Milton's Latin translation of the declaration of war against the states of Holland and, on the order of the committee for foreign affairs, English and Latin versions of John Selden's Mare clausum. = Written = Specialising in school textbooks, over the course of his life Dugard published a variety of works for the use of local schools: * Rhetorices elementa (Principles of Rhetoric, 1648). * The English Rudiments of the Latine Tongue (1656) * Lexicon Graeci Testamenti aphabeticum; una cum explicatione grammatica vocum singularum, in usum tironum.

Although the design was completed by the Antonov Design Bureau in 1994, the type was not built. Development The An-180 was designed as a replacement for the aging Tupolev Tu-134 and Yakovlev Yak-42 airliners. Antonov was discussing this aircraft in Soviet aviation publications as early as October , describing the An-180 as a 164-180 passenger plane with a range of and a per-passenger fuel consumption of . The proposed aircraft was introduced to the world at the 1991 Paris Air Show. As of September , the An-180 had a T-tail design with the propfan engines attached to the aft fuselage, but Antonov later modified the design so that the engines were attached to the ends of the horizontal stabilizer in a conventional tail configuration. In , Ukraine and China were studying whether to jointly develop the aircraft. In April , a prototype of the aircraft was tested at the Russian Central Aviation Institute's transonic wind tunnel, with follow-up tests in July to finalize the design, but financial problems delayed the completion of the study as of November 1994. By February , joint manufacturing was expected to begin at the aircraft factories in Kharkiv, Ukraine and the Production Corporation Polyot plant in Omsk, Russia. Because of extreme funding shortfalls from the Ukraine government, however, the development of the An-180 was fully suspended by August 1995. In , D-27 engines created by the Progress Design Bureau were still expected to be built for the An-180, according to the CEO of Motor Sich, the Ukrainian manufacturer of the D-27. Subsequent attempts to obtain commercial investment failed, though, and by , the An-180 was no longer an Antonov project. As of 2003, the fuselage of an uncompleted An-180 aircraft remained in storage in a building used for assembly of Antonov's experimental models. Design The An-180 was a conventionally designed low-wing cantilever monoplane with a conventional tail unit. The unusual feature was the mounting of an Ivchenko Progress D-27 propfan mounted at the end of each tailplane. Each propfan was to have a coaxial contra-rotating tractor propeller, and the An-180 was also designed with a retractable landing gear with twin nosewheels, and tandem pairs of mainwheels. It was planned to have a number of variants with seating starting at 150–156 passengers, to a larger variant for 200 passengers, and it was also planned to build a combination passenger/freight and an all-freight variant. The cabin is configured to use two aisles, with a seating row containing two seats each between an aisle and the adjacent windows/cabin walls, and two seats between the two aisles.

Yates, Historical Dictionary of Gabon (third edition, 2006), pages 237-238.Jeune Afrique L'intelligent, Issues 2189-2197 (2003), page 69 .) is a Gabonese politician and army general. A relative of President Omar Bongo, Ngari rose rapidly through the ranks of the army, ultimately serving as Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces from 1984 to 1994. He then held a succession of posts in the government of Gabon, serving as Minister of Defense from 1994 to 1999, Minister of Transport from 1999 to 2002, Minister of the Interior from 2002 to 2004, Minister of Public Works from 2004 to 2007, Minister of Tourism from 2007 to 2009, and finally as Minister of Health in 2009. Considered one of Gabon's most powerful figures during Omar Bongo's rule, Ngari is a member of the Gabonese Democratic Party (PDG). Military career An ethnic Téké, Ngari was born in Ngouoni, located in the Haut-Ogooué Province of eastern Gabon, in 1946.\\"Gabon : Pour l’élection présidentielle de 2012, Idriss Ngari peut mettre tout le monde d’accord\\" , Infos Plus Gabon, 24 May 2009 . Omar Bongo, who was also a native of Haut-Ogooué, was a maternal uncle of Ngari.Andreas Mehler, Henning Melber, and Klaas Van Walraven, Africa Yearbook: Politics, Economy and Society South of the Sahara (2004), page 236. Ngari joined the army in 1968 and trained to become an officer, studying in Côte d'Ivoire at the officers' school in Bouaké, as well as at Montpellier in France. Back in Gabon, he rose quickly to very high rank: he was aide-de-camp to the Military Cabinet of President Omar Bongo from 1977 to 1978, Chief of Staff of Ground and Naval Forces from 1978 to 1983, and then Chief of Staff of the Armies from 1983 to 1984. Ngari was appointed as Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces in 1984 and remained in that post for ten years. As Chief of Staff, he ordered commandos from the Presidential Guard to destroy Radio Liberté, an opposition radio station, on 22 February 1994; the destruction of the station led to several weeks of unrest.\\"Gabon Human Rights Practices, 1994\\", United States Department of State, February 1995. According to Ngari, the station was inciting violence and hatred and it had to be shut down for the good of the country.Africa Research Bulletin (1994), Blackwell, page 11,241. Soon after the destruction of Radio Liberté, President Bongo appointed Ngari to the government as Minister of Defense, Security, and Immigration in March 1994.\\"Ngari Idriss\\", Gabon: Les Hommes de Pouvoir N°4, Africa Intelligence, 5 March 2002 . Given its sensitive status, Bongo was always careful to maintain reliable control over the Defense Ministry; for years he had personally managed the defense portfolio, and beginning in 1981 he entrusted it to family members. Ngari's appointment marked a continuation of that practice.Gardinier and Yates, Historical Dictionary of Gabon, page 80. Political career As Minister of Defense, Security, and Immigration, Ngari oversaw a January 1995 operation in which about 50,000 illegal immigrants were expelled from Gabon, while about 15,000 were granted legal status and allowed to remain. A powerful figure in the PDG regime, possessing extensive influence within the military and his own Téké ethnic group, Ngari was close to President Bongo and was considered a rival to Bongo's son, Ali Bongo.\\"Ali Bongo Ondimba, candidat officiel du PDG à la présidentielle\\", Infos Plus Gabon, 16 July 2009 . He and Ali Bongo competed for political dominance in the Haut-Ogooué Province at the time of the December 1996 parliamentary election.Africa Contemporary Record, volume 27 (2004), page B-348. Ngari supported candidates who ran against Ali Bongo's allies in seeking the PDG nominations for parliamentary seats in the province, but his candidates were not successful. Ngari, however, was elected to a seat in the National Assembly. After the 1996 election, Ngari remained Minister of Defense, Security, and Immigration, and he was assigned additional responsibility for posts and telecommunications on 28 January 1997.\\"Décret N° 144/PR, fixant la composition du Gouvernement\\", Journal Officiel de la République Gabonaise, January 1997, pages 2-3 . However, he was moved to the position of Minister of Transport and the Merchant MarineList of governments of Gabon , IZF.net (accessed 27 March 2010) . on 25 January 1999, and his rival, Ali Bongo, was appointed to replace him at the Defense Ministry. President Bongo was reportedly displeased by Ngari's electoral competition with his son in 1996. Rumors suggested that Ngari was deeply frustrated by the 1999 reshuffle, in which he was effectively demoted, for long afterward.Georges Dougueli and Christophe Boisbouvier, \\"Parti présidentiel cherche candidat\\", Jeune Afrique, 23 June 2009 . Identified as the leader of \\"aggressive loyalists\\" within the PDG regime, Ngari and his supporters resisted the inclusion of more members of the opposition in the government; President Bongo typically endeavored to co-opt opposition parties by offering ministerial portfolios to their leaders.Political Risk Yearbook: Sub-Saharan Africa (2000), page 33. He was again elected to the National Assembly in the December 2001 parliamentary election, and on 27 January 2002 he was moved to the position of Minister of the Interior, Public Security, and Decentralization. Ngari spent two and a half years as Interior Minister before being appointed as Minister of Public Works, Equipment, and Construction on 5 September 2004;\\"Léger remaniement gouvernemental au Gabon\\", AFP, 5 September 2004 . he was promoted to the rank of Minister of State, while retaining the same portfolio, on 21 January 2006. In the December 2006 parliamentary election, he was again elected to the National Assembly as a PDG candidate in Haut-Ogooué Province.\\"Liste des Députés par Circonscription\\" , National Assembly website (accessed 5 January 2009) . He was later moved to the post of Minister of Tourism and National Parks on 29 December 2007 and was simultaneously reduced to the rank of ordinary minister. Later, in the government named on 14 January 2009, he was instead appointed as Minister of Public Health and Public Hygiene.\\"Gabon: Liste des Membres du nouveau gouvernement Gabonais rendue publique mercredi soir (Officiel)\\" , Gabonews, 14 January 2009 . Although Ngari, who was associated with the PDG's cacique wing, was disliked by the PDG's reformist (renovateurs) wing, which was headed by Ali Bongo, he was nevertheless considered a potential successor to Omar Bongo. After Omar Bongo died on 8 June 2009, Ngari was considered perhaps the most formidable potential challenger to Ali Bongo in the contest for the PDG's presidential nomination, but he chose not to seek the nomination\\"Gabon: Dix candidats dont une femme pour la candidature du PDG à la prochaine présidentielle\\" , Gabonews, 5 July 2009 . and it was won by Bongo. It was reported that Ngari briefly considered allying himself with Pierre Mamboundou, an old opponent of Omar Bongo and the PDG,Georges Dougueli, \\"Gérer la famille\\", Jeune Afrique, 17 November 2009 . but he nevertheless supported Bongo's campaign.Georges Dougueli, \\"Ali impose son style\\", Jeune Afrique, 8 November 2009 . Amidst the events of mid-2009, Ngari remained in his post as Minister of Public Health. While visiting hospitals on 5 August 2009, he announced that the first known case of the H1N1 flu in Gabon had been found. He said that the patient, a French national, had been quarantined, and he called for vigilance to prevent any outbreak of the disease.\\"Gabon: Un premier cas de grippe AH1N1 détecter au Gabon\\", Gabonews, 6 August 2009 . Bongo officially prevailed in the 30 August 2009 presidential election, defeating Mamboundou and an array of other challengers; upon taking office, he immediately dismissed Ngari from the government on 17 October 2009.\\"Gabon: Liste complète du nouveau gouvernement gabonais\\", Gabonews, 17 October 2009 . Ngari's dismissal was part of a major reworking of the state administration, in which many prominent ministers and officials were replaced. Having lost his post in the government, Ngari then took up his seat in the National Assembly, representing Ngouoni.Georges Dougueli, \\"Les sacrifiés\\", Jeune Afrique, 12 March 2010 . In the December 2011 parliamentary election, Ndari was re-elected to the National Assembly. He was then elected as Second Vice-President of the National Assembly on 27 February 2012.\\"Guy Nzouba reste au perchoir\\", Gaboneco, 28 February 2012 . Personal life and other activities Like Omar and Ali Bongo, Ngari is a Muslim, belonging to a faith that is practiced by only a very small percentage of the native Gabonese population. He is a member of the Higher Council of Islamic Affairs of Gabon, a body that works to coordinate Islamic activities.

The center of Tegulus' cult is at Ivrea. Veneration for Saint Tegulus actually arose at the end of the 10th century, when during the episcopate of Blessed Warmondus (Varmondo), the saint's relics were discovered in a sepulcher situated a short distance away from Ivrea. The relics were solemnly translated to the cathedral of Ivrea within the city walls, and placed in the chapel of San Giacomo. The relics were later translated, with those of Saint Bessus, to the chapel of Santissimo Sacramento. According to local tradition, Tegulus survived the decimation of his Legion but was eventually beheaded on the road to Montaldo Dora, at the spot later occupied by the chapel of Santa Croce, which was built in the 14th century. However, nothing certain was known of him, though he may have been a local Christian martyred for his faith during the last imperial persecutions; his cult was linked with that of the Theban Legion to lend antiquity to a local saint about whom nothing was really known. Damiano Pomi theorizes that the relics may have been the remains of a soldier that were mistaken for those of a Christian martyr. The name Tegulus, as Pomi also theorizes, may in fact not have been his name at all, but a reference to the building material commonly used for Roman graves: the tegula or tile.

Veandercross was a brown, rangy gelding bred by Bill Luey at Lower Hutt not far from the Trentham Racecourse. Foaled on 14 October 1988, he was by Crossways (GB), out of the unraced mare Lavender, who was in turn a daughter of the sire Super Gray (USA), meaning he was closely inbred (3m x 3f) to champion racehorse and sire Nijinsky. Crossways only produced two other stakes winners in his career, Awesome Ways and Prince of Praise. Lavender had nine foals race for three winners. Racing career He was trained by his part- owner Chris Turner, a full-time schoolteacher at the provincial racing centre of Wanganui in New Zealand, prompting his nickname, \\"The Wanganui Wonder\\". He was usually ridden by jockey Jim Walker. =Three-year-old races in New Zealand= Veandercross showed immediate promise in the 1991-1992 New Zealand racing season when as a three-year-old he won his first three races including two listed events. He then ran second in the Wanganui Guineas to the front running Lodore Lady before winning the Okawa Guineas at Hastings. He was narrowly defeated twice at Trentham, in the Wellington Guineas trial (½ length) and the Wellington Guineas (by a head to Solvit). He easily won the New Zealand 2000 Guineas and the Bayer Classic (now called the Levin Classic) - both G1 races over 1,600 metres. Then he came north for the Avondale Guineas and once more ran home late, for third placing. On to the New Zealand Derby and in a very rough race where the eventual winner Cavallieri (a horse who never won another race) bumped a number of horses sideways, cannoning a horse into Veandercross, who recovered his stride, but he couldn't quite overtake the winner, going down by a half head. The siren went, but in an extraordinary enquiry, the stewards dismissed the appeal. In these races, he displayed what would become his characteristic come-from-behind style of racing. It made it more likely he would encounter trouble in the run, and he was often described as \\"unlucky in defeat.\\" An increasing number of pundits were starting to blame jockey Jim Walker for his unlucky late runs but Chris Turner fully supported the jockey. =Three-year-old races in Australia= Given the immense promise he had shown in New Zealand, it was decided to send Veandercross to Australia for the autumn racing carnival in Sydney. In Australia, he would be co-trained by John Wheeler, of Rough Habit fame. On his Australian debut, he put in one of his \\"unlucky\\" closing efforts in defeat in the Gosford Guineas over 1,600 metres. He would show his true ability at his next start in the Canterbury Guineas over 1,900 metres, where his opponents included the best three-year- old in Australia, Naturalism. At Canterbury, Veandercross came from last of about 20 runners on a tight-turning track to win. Naturalism was second. Next time out, Naturalism and Veandercross again faced each other in the Rosehill Guineas over 2,000 metres. Veandercross started as the favourite horse, and again dropped out to last and ran on strongly, but he encountered interference in the straight, and Naturalism was able to hang on to score a narrow victory. Naturalism and Veandercross again met in the AJC Australian Derby over 2,400 metres, which would be the decider as to who was the best three-year-old in Australasia, Veandercross ran on from well back, but failed to catch Naturalism. =Four-year-old racing season= Veandercross returned an even better horse as a four-year-old. He started with an easy win in the Trust Bank Stakes (G3) on his home track, then chased home the front running Conan in the Mason Appliances (G2) at New Plymouth. He reversed that result in his next race, easily winning the Kelt Capital Stakes (G3) at Hastings, defeating Conan on the line. Veandercross was then sent to Australia to start favourite in the Caulfield Cup. On Cup day the Caulfield track was an absolute bog. In one of the most controversial rides in Australian racing history, champion jockey Shane Dye went extremely wide on the home turn to avoid the slow, muddy ground on the inside. Despite covering this extra ground, Veandercross managed to pass every runner in the straight except one, the talented mare Mannerism, who won in a photo finish after staying inside Veandercross. Shane Dye was widely criticised for his ride, but he defended himself, insisting that the extra ground he covered on the horse was more than made up for by the firmer ground he raced on as a result. Nevertheless, the criticism persisted, and recreations of the horse's journey in the race showed that he covered nearly 2,500 metres, in what was supposed to be a 2,400 metre race.The Age - Caulfield Cup Retrieved on 2009-7-20 At his next start, Veandercross won the G1 LKS Mackinnon Stakes at Flemington, overcoming interference to win emphatically. This would be his last prep race before the Melbourne Cup three days later, a race in which he would start favourite. It was again a wet track, and although Veandercross ploughed home determinedly, he could not catch the wet track stayer Subzero in the straight. So Veandercross finished his campaign with the frustrating record of having run second in both the major Cups races. Veandercross returned as an autumn four-year-old, winning the Lion Brown Sprint (G1) at Te Rapa in New Zealand, and then the Carlyon Cup and the Australian Cup in Melbourne. He then travelled north to Sydney where he would face his old rival Naturalism in the Ranvet Stakes. In the meantime, Naturalism had franked their three-year-old form internationally by running second in the Japan Cup in the spring. In the Ranvet Stakes, Veandercross was clearly superior, winning by over a length and confirming his position as the best racehorse in Australasia. He then ran third in The BMW Stakes (G1) and reconfirmed his supremacy winning the AJC Queen Elizabeth Stakes over 2,000 metres at Randwick impressively. This rounded off an excellent four-year-old season, which had netted five G1 victories. At the end of the 1992/3 racing season, he was crowned Australian Champion Racehorse of the Year. = Five- year-old campaign= Expectations were high when Veandercross returned to racing as a five-year-old. He started his season with a sixth on his home track before he raced home in the Russells Akai TV Stakes (G3) at Hawkes Bay, just failing to catch, Calm Harbour, by a neck, with a neck back to Solvit. He then went over to Australia, where after a good opening run for fifth in the Underwood Stakes, he failed in the Caulfield Stakes. He then contested the Cox Plate and was unsuccessful again, and finished his season early after an eighth in the Mackinnon Stakes, being defeated in those races by many of the horses over whom he had been dominant the previous season. =Six-year-old campaign= Veandercross commenced his campaign with a sixth in the Trust Bank Stakes (G3) at Wanganui, but was right back to his best with a good run in the Enerco Stakes (G2) at Hastings, flashing home for second to new star Snap, with half head back to Solvit. He then crossed the Tasman Sea, opening with another fast finish for fourth behind Durbridge in the George Main Stakes at Randwick. Then unfortunately he succumbed to an injury and was retired. =1997-98 season = After a long break Veandercross returned to racing in the 1997-8 season aged nine, with a big effort for a close seventh in the Waikato Draught Sprint (G1), then stormed home again for a close ninth in the Otaki Maori WFA 1400 (G1). He once more headed across the Tasman for one last Australian campaign, but couldn't recapture his form and was defeated by Octagonal in the Australian Cup at Flemington and failed to run on in the Easter Cup at Caulfield. Chris Turner then made the decision to finally retire this champion racehorse. He had 40 starts during his career for 15 wins, nine seconds and four thirds, earning A$2,602,524. He won eight times at Group One level.ASB - Veandercross (NZ) Retrieved on 2009-7-20 =Summary= Veandercross was a top-quality middle distance horse who became the dominant weight-for-age racehorse in Australasia. He is remembered for his rivalry with Naturalism , and for having run second in the Melbourne Cup and Caulfield Cup in 1992. =Death= Veandercross was put down on Caulfield Cup day 2014 (October 18) aged 26.Race ends for 'real character' Veandercross Wanganui Chronicle, November 5, 2014 See also Thoroughbred racing in New Zealand References * Veandercross's racing record * 1992 Caulfield Cup * NZ Racing Category:1988 racehorse births Category:2014 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in New Zealand Category:Racehorses trained in New Zealand Category:Racehorses trained in Australia Category:Thoroughbred family 7-d ","title":"Veandercross"},{"id":"20894309","text":"Sedat Edip Bucak (born 31 October 1960 in Siverek) is a Kurdish politician and the leader of the Bucak tribe in Siverek, Şanlıurfa Province, and a Turkish politician elected to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey in 1991, 1995 and 1999.

In January 1793, after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars he joined Hotham's new flagship, the 100-gun , and went out to the Mediterranean with him. On 30 January 1795 Peard was promoted to command the sloop . Command On 5 May he was posted to , and in July was appointed to the Britannia as second captain. From her, in January 1796, he was moved into the 98-gun , which he still commanded on 18 January 1797, when, as the fleet was leaving Lisbon, she ran aground, had to cut away her masts, and was left behind disabled, while the fleet went on to fight the battle of Cape St. Vincent. The ship afterwards rejoined the flag off Cadiz, and was still there in the beginning of July, when a violent mutiny broke out on board. Peard, with his own hands, assisted by the first lieutenant, seized two of the ringleaders, dragged them out of the crowd, and had them put in irons. His daring and resolute conduct struck terror into the rest, and they returned to their duty; but the two men were promptly tried, convicted, and hanged on 8–9 July. Of Peard's conduct on this occasion St. Vincent thought very highly, and many years afterwards wrote, ‘his merit in facing the mutiny on board the St. George ought never to be forgotten or unrewarded’. In March 1799 Peard commissioned the frigate for the Mediterranean, and on his way out, when off Lisbon, fell in with and was chased by the Brest fleet. He, however, made good his escape, and joined Lord Keith off Cadiz on 3 May, in time to warn him of the approaching danger. In the following February the Success formed part of the squadron employed in the blockade of Malta, and on the 18th, at the Battle of the Malta Convoy, had a large share in the capture of the Généreux, hampering her movements as she tried to escape, and raking her several times. On 9 February 1801 the Success was lying at Gibraltar, when a strong French squadron, under Rear-Admiral Honoré Ganteaume, passed through the Straits of Gibraltar. Peard conjectured—as was the fact—that they were bound for Egypt, and thinking that Keith ought to have warning of their presence in the Mediterranean, he immediately followed, hoping to pass them on the way. He fell in with them off Cape Gata, but was prevented by calms and variable winds from passing, and, after a chase of three days, was overtaken and captured. From the prisoners Ganteaume learned that the route to Egypt might be full of danger to himself, and turned aside to Toulon, whence Peard and his men were at once sent in a cartel to Port Mahon. On his return to England he was appointed in June to , in which he joined the squadron at Gibraltar under Sir James Saumarez, and took part in the actions at Algeciras on 6 July, and in the Straits on the night of the 12th. The Audacious was afterwards sent to the West Indies, and was paid off in October 1802. In 1803 and during the Napoleonic Wars Peard commanded the sea fencibles on the coast of Cornwall. Flag rank and later life On 5 July 1814 he was superannuated as a rear- admiral, but was restored to the active list on 5 July 1827, advanced to be vice-admiral on 22 July 1830, and died at Barton Place, near Exeter, on 27 December 1832. He married Elizabeth Bligh, the daughter of Sir Richard Rodney Bligh, and from her left two sons, of whom the elder, George, died, a captain in the navy, in 1837; the younger, John Whitehead, became famous as \\"Garibaldi's Englishman\\". His granddaughter was the novelist Frances Mary Peard.

The purpose of an open space reserve may include the preservation or conservation of a community or region's rural natural or historic character; the conservation or preservation of a land or water area for the sake of recreational, ecological, environmental, aesthetic, or agricultural interests; or the management of a community or region's growth in terms of development, industry, or natural resources extraction. Open space reserves may be urban, suburban, or rural; they may be actual designated areas of land or water, or they may be zoning districts or overlays where development is limited or controlled to create undeveloped areas of land or water within a community or region. They may be publicly owned or owned by non-profit or private interests. A certain amount of overlap occurs with similar planning and conservation terms. Protected areas are open space reserves in which certain resources indigenous to the landscape are protected as opposed to conserved. Urban open space specifically refers to open space reserves within an urban setting; such may include natural landscapes or manicured urban parkland. Greenways are linear open space reserves, linear corridors that span interconnected open space reserves, or linear chains of connected open space reserves. A green belt is a general area of open space surrounding an urban area. Green infrastructure is the total mass and viability of undeveloped, natural, and agricultural land and waterways, protected or not protected, within a particular community or region. Nature reserves and wildlife refuges are areas of open space set aside for the sake of protecting non-human species. National parks, state parks, and municipal parks, recreation areas, and reservations are types of open space reserves managed by government agencies for the primary purpose of passive or active human enjoyment. National forests, state forests, and municipal forests are types of open space reserves set aside for the primary purpose of forest conservation. Flood control projects and protected ecological research areas may also be considered open space reserves secondary to their primary purpose. There is growing evidence that open space is unequally distributed based on race and class, particularly in the US state of California, leading to concerns regarding Open Space Accessibility in California and other areas.

It is reverentially named after a Rigvedic sage Vashistha who lived in the 2nd millennium BCE, but the text was probably composed by unknown authors between 300 BCE – 100 CE.Robert Lingat, The Classical Law of India, (Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers Pvt Ltd, 1993), p.24 It forms an independent text and other parts of the Kalpasūtra, that is Shrauta- and Grihya-sutras are missing. It is written in sutra style, and contains 1,038 sutras. According to Patrick Olivelle – a professor of Sanskrit and Indian religions, the text may be dated closer to the start of the common era, possibly the 1st century, since it uses the pronoun \\"I\\" and a style as if the text is a personal teaching guide, and because it is the oldest Indian text that mentions \\"the use of written evidence in judicial proceedings\\". Like the dozens of other texts in this genre, the Vashistha Dharmasutra is a treatise on Dharma that discusses duties, responsibilities and ethics to oneself, to family and as a member of society. This Dharmasūtra is likely of a later date than the Gautama and Baudhayana Dharmasutras that have also survived. However, like many Dharmasutras and Dharmasastras of Hinduism, the manuscripts of this text that have survived show evidence of revisions and some very corrupt passages. The chapters of Vashistha Dharmasutra are arranged in the manner of later Smritis. Organization and Contents Some of the topics discussed in this Dharmasūtra are sources of law, sins, marriage, governance, social classes, rites of passage (birth, menstruation, marriage, cremation), good conduct, orders of life (ashrama), charity and guests, adoption, excommunication and loss of caste, readmission to caste, mixed classes, crimes, murder, adultery, theft, suicide, killing animals, penances, punishment for minor and major crimes, gifts, and others. =On need and sources of law= The Vashistha Dharmasutra states that the desire to know Dharma is for the \\"sake of attaining the highest goal of man\\", and one who knows it and follows is the righteous one. The text states that the Vedas and the traditional texts are a source of Dharma knowledge, but these do not offer guidance or conflict, then the practices of \\"cultured men free from desires and tangible motives\\" constitute what is right.

Matthews, a Vancouver City Archivist notes that the lakes were once called Crystal Lakes but were never found on any maps.\\"Elfin Lakes.\\" Crown Registry and Geographic Base. GeoBC. Web. 22 Oct 2011. The area has always been a popular destination for hikers and skiers since the creation of the park in the 1927. Then a local lodge was built in the early 1940s by Joan Mathews, Ottar Brandvold, and his brother Emil and was called the Diamond Head Chalet, but it is now unused and decaying. It attracted many hikers and backcountry skiers. Eventually the owners retired, and ownership was transferred to BC Parks. They chose to not maintain it and built the new Elfin Lakes shelter a few metres south. However, the road that was built is still used as a trail and service road. A moving film made by the Brandvolds showcases Garibaldi Park and the Diamond Head Chalet. Recreation All recreational activities in the area are governed by the regulations of Garibaldi Provincial Park. Primary access to the lake is via an 11 km (5.5 mi) long trail, which gains approximately of elevation from the trailhead. There are campgrounds and an overnight shelter at the lakes and campgrounds and a day-use shelter or a winter overnight shelter in Red Heather Meadows. During winter, the lake is typically frozen from late December to late April. Much of the trail up is on a rarely used forest service road and has an approximate grade of 5.5%. Approximately half of the trail is in forest, while the remaining half is in alpine meadows with clear views of the surrounding mountains. There are separate trails for mountain bicycling, hiking, and winter use. Hiking trails continue past Elfin Lakes towards Opal Cone, Mamquam Lake, Columnar Peak, the Gargoyles, and Little Diamond Head. It is also possible to travel to Mount Garibaldi and Diamond Head in the winter. Swimming is permitted in the top lake, and the lower lake is reserved for drinking water only.

In 2013, the documentary Las Niñas de Oro (The Golden Girls), directed by Carlos Beltrán, was released on YouTube. It tells the story of the Olympic champion team in Atlanta through interviews with the gymnasts themselves, and in 2016 she attended the 20th Anniversary Gala of the Gold Medal in Atlanta '96 in Badajoz with the rest of the team. She has received several awards, including the Olympic Order from the Spanish Olympic Committee (1996), the Gold Plaque of the Royal Order of Sports Merit (1996), the Baron de Güell Cup at the National Sports Awards (1997), and the Gold Medal of the Royal Order of Sports Merit (2015). In 2020, she lives in Escarrilla, teaches annually at the Tania Lamarca Rhythmic Gymnastics Campus, gives numerous lectures on the knowledge and values that her sports experience has brought her, and is a member of the Sport & Play sports coaching team. In 2016, she was a candidate for the presidency of the Alava Gymnastics Federation, and for 2017 she presented her sportswear line.  Beginnings and first competitions  Lamarca trained with Iratxe Aurrekoetxea at the Abetxuko Sports Centre during his time at Club Aurrera. An uncle of hers, José Luis Lamarca, had been a football player in teams such as Deportivo Alavés, Club Deportivo Vitoria or Club Deportivo Aurrera in the 60s and 70s. Tania started rhythmic gymnastics at the age of 5, in 1985, at the Colegio Canciller Ayala in Vitoria as part of her extracurricular activities. Later she joined the ranks of Club Arabatxo, where she was trained by Agurtzane Ibargutxi in the gymnasium of the Fundación Estadio. In 1991, she participated in her first Spanish Championship, held in Torrevieja. Shortly afterwards she moved to a school in the Town Hall trained by Iratxe Aurrekoetxea, which soon became Club IVEF. There he trained alternatively for about two years both in the European Civic Centre and in the IVEF (Basque Institute of Physical Education) sports centre, which is now the Faculty of Physical Activity and Sport Sciences at the University of the Basque Country. The club later became a section of Club Deportivo Aurrera de Vitoria, then called Club Aurrera, although in 1996 it became independent and was renamed Club Beti Aurrera, which is its current name. During his time at the Aurrera, he always trained under Aurrekoetxea at the Abetxuko Sports Centre (Vitoria). Other famous national gymnasts would emerge from the Aurrera, such as Estíbaliz Martínez or Almudena Cid. In 1994, Tania was proclaimed Spanish Junior Champion at the Spanish Individual \\"B\\" Championship, held in Guadalajara, where she won the gold medal in both the general competition and the finals of each of the four apparatus (hoop, mallet, ribbon and hands-free). The Moscardó Gymnasium, in the Salamanca district (Madrid), was the training ground for the national rhythmic gymnastics team until 1997. In September 1994, she went to her first control in Madrid to join the national team. There, her club mate, Estíbaliz Martínez, would be selected. Tania, however, was not chosen due to her height of 1.54m, which was below the 1.60m sought by the national coach, Emilia Boneva. After her coach told her the reasons, Tania thought about retiring from gymnastics. However, encouraged by Iratxe Aurrekoetxea and the club's physical trainer, Javi Orbañanos, she continued training in Vitoria with the aim of convincing the coach of her technical quality in the following championships. In an interview with ETB in 1995, Aurrekoetxea, asked about Lamarca's characteristics, besides highlighting her technical preparation and physical qualities, referred to her as a \\"very hard-working\\" gymnast, pointing out that \\"everything she has achieved she has achieved because she is always training, and training, and training, every day\\". In a 2016 interview with On the Tapestry, her later coach Emilia Boneva also noted that \\"[Tania] was the little 'worker bee', for her, there was no 'I can't' or 'I don't want to'\\".Rhythmic gymnasts composition See also * List of gymnasts * List of Olympic medalists in gymnastics (women) * Gymnastics at the Pan American Games * World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships * Gymnastics at the World Games * Rhythmic Gymnastics European Championships References External links   * Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Spanish rhythmic gymnasts Category:Olympic gold medalists for Spain Category:Gymnasts at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gymnasts of Spain Category:Olympic medalists in gymnastics Category:Medalists at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the Rhythmic Gymnastics World Championships Category:Sportspeople from Vitoria-Gasteiz ","title":"Tania Lamarca"},{"id":"20894347","text":"The Brandywine Highway is a north–south limited-access highway in the vicinity of the city of Binghamton, New York, in the United States. The highway is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation and extends for through Downtown Binghamton and the neighboring village of Port Dickinson. The southern terminus of the highway is at New York State Route 434 (NY 434) in Binghamton and its northern terminus is at Interstate 88 (I-88) in Fenton just north of the Port Dickinson village line. The Brandywine Highway is designated as New York State Route 363 from NY 434 to Brandywine Avenue and part of NY 7 from Brandywine Avenue to I-88. NY 363 is also known as North Shore Drive. Route description The Brandywine Highway begins as NY 363 at an interchange with NY 434 in Downtown Binghamton near the confluence of the Susquehanna and Chenango Rivers. The route, a limited-access extension of North Shore Drive, heads northeast along the north bank of the Susquehanna River and around the downtown district. While on the riverbank, NY 363 southbound connects to Susquehanna Street by way of an interchange. Due to the presence of the Susquehanna River south of the freeway, the onramps from NY 434 north and Susquehanna Street (via Carroll Street) to NY 363 north are actually located north of NY 363 southbound for a short distance (thus running anti-parallel to traffic on NY 363 southbound) before passing under NY 363 south and merging with NY 363 northbound on the left-hand side of the road. Past Susquehanna Street, NY 363 continues along the Susquehanna River to a parclo interchange with U.S. Route 11 (US 11, named Court Street) just east of NYSEG Stadium. Past US 11, the expressway leaves the riverbank and heads northward over the Norfolk Southern Railway's Southern Tier Line before merging with NY 7 (Brandywine Avenue) northbound. Here, NY 363 ends and the freeway becomes part of NY 7\\\\. Although most of the Brandywine Highway is limited-access, there is an at-grade intersection between NY 7 and Frederick Street just north of the Brandywine Avenue interchange. However, only right- hand turns are permitted from NY 7\\\\. North of Frederick Street, the highway becomes limited-access once more and connects to the conjoined routes of I-81 and NY 17 by way of a cloverleaf interchange. Just north of the cloverleaf's northern tip is a simpler diamond interchange between NY 7 and Bevier Street. The highway continues on, paralleling a branch line off the Southern Tier Line northward through the city and into the village of Port Dickinson. A second at-grade intersection exists with Old State Road; however, unlike the first with Frederick Street, there are no turn restrictions at this intersection. NY 7 becomes limited-access once more, meeting a pair of service roads that serve Hillcrest before merging with I-88 just north of the Port Dickinson village limits in the town of Fenton. The Brandywine Highway ends here; however, NY 7 continues onto I-88.

The portion of the freeway north of Brandywine Avenue became a realignment of NY 7 while the remaining section from NY 434 to Brandywine Avenue was initially unnumbered. The NY 434–Brandywine Avenue segment was designated as NY 363 on July 1, 1974. In the late 1980s, the northernmost portion of the highway was reconfigured to accommodate the new I-88.

He was captured with a fake identity document in İstanbul on September 8, 1978 and brought to Ankara. In 1986, he applied to the Public Prosecution Office in order to benefit from the provisions of the Act 3419. He accepted responsibility for the Bahçelievler massacre in his testimony, but he did not add any new information. He was sentenced to execution seven times, but as a right-wing militant his sentence wasn't carried out and converted to ten years of prison time for each murder he committed. In contrast, Erdal Eren was executed a few years ago due to an alleged murder despite being seventeen years old at the time. On July 16, 1989, he attempted to escape from Bursa Prison with a fake ID on the name of Ali Ekinci during an open visit. On April 26, 1991, he was conditionally released from Bursa Prison. In 1991, certain intelligence was received, according to which he would go to Germany to join the administration of the Turkish Federation. Haluk Kırcı has a remarkable influence among the ultra- nationalist activists and relations to persons at the top level of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP).

The display, which involves the residents of most of the houses on the block (with three-story rowhouses on the north side of the street and two-story ones with second-floor bay windows on the south side), started in 1947 (the same year that its namesake movie debuted), and takes place between late November and late December. The location becomes a major attraction for visitors from all over the area.HighBeam The display prominently features Christmas trees of varying styles, trains, animated figures, Walt Disney cartoon characters, Hanukkah menorahs, artwork, and other various symbols of the holiday season, including a sea of Santas and Frosty the Snowmans. Notable artists Some of the residents are renowned for their various displays. These include: *Jim Pollock: Known for the hubcap Christmas trees, one of which is usually displayed prominently on his lawn, along with his snowmen made of bicycle wheels. He is sometimes the only resident who allows visitors inside his house to view his artwork. *Elaine Doyle-Gillespie: Known for her theme of peace In popular culture *The lit-up block of 34th Street has been seen in some Maryland Lottery commercials.HighBeam *Actor Richard Chamberlain has been seen publicly at the event. CriticismNeighborhood concerns= The event has drawn criticism from a couple city residents over the amount of traffic created by vehicles passing on the block, and parking shortages caused by visitors parking on nearby streets. No extra police officers are used to monitor traffic. Those on other nearby streets have also complained about noise caused by crowds from the event, and the noise and pollution caused by tour buses idling while parked on nearby streets while allowing busloads to walk along the block. =Energy issues= Participants have been criticized for the high use of energy needed to operate electronic decorations. But the block's residents have continued the annual tradition every year since 1987, regardless of rises in energy costs that have occurred in recent years.http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4183/is_/ai_n17078026 Some participants have reduced the amount of energy they use by utilizing LED lights, or displaying artwork that uses little or no electricity. According to Baltimore Gas & Electric, the average energy cost per participating resident is less than $10 per month. In some cases, neighbors have assisted those who have trouble affording energy costs by pulling extension cords into their houses. This has created concerns about fire hazards.https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-126425353 Local news stations have warned visitors that though people may stand on this block and claim to be collecting tips for the energy costs of the display, residents are willing to foot the bill themselves, and do not collect any donations for this purpose. However, vendors do legitimately sell refreshments at nearby corners, not for their own personal profit, but for the benefit of visitors.

She wrote for, among others, the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter and the magazines Idun and Vecko-Journalen. She reported from various scenes during the Spanish Civil War, World War II and the Cold War. Biography Alving was born in Uppsala, as the youngest daughter of the author and columnist Fanny Alving and Hjalmar Alving, who was a lecturer in Scandinavian languages and Nordic literature. At the age of eleven she moved with her family to Stockholm, where Hjalmar Alving had been appointed headmaster at Whitlockska samskolan. Alving was enrolled at Whitlockska, and graduated in 1928. Alving never married, but she had a daughter, Maud Fanny Alving, with illustrator and artist Birger Lundquist in 1938. Maud, better known as Ruffa Alving-Olin, was also a journalist, who collected and published letters, notes and other materials after Barbro Alving's death. Alving formed a household with Anna Laura Sjöcrona when her daughter was one year old, and the three constituted \\"a different kind of family\\", in Ruffa's words. Alving and Sjöcrona lived together for over 40 years, until Alving's death. Career Alving was an editorial secretary at the weekly magazine Idun from 1928 to 1931, and then a journalist at Dagens Nyheter from 1934 to 1959. At the age of 27 she reported from the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin and the Spanish Civil War.”Så nu är man Sveriges styvaste journalist, piddelipej”, retrospective article in Dagens Nyheter 27 March 2014, retrieved 19 May 2014 Dagens Nyheter also sent her as a reporter to write about the Finnish Winter War in 1939-40, the German occupation of Norway in 1940, and the Hungarian Revolution in 1956. As a foreign correspondent, she reported from the United States, Vietnam, Africa and the Far East over a number of years. Alving became a pacifist, and converted to Catholicism in 1959. She supported the campaign in the 1950s to prevent Sweden from acquiring nuclear weapons. Because of her convictions, she left Dagens Nyheter, whose editor-in-chief was in favour of a Swedish nuclear defence, and started working at the weekly magazine Vecko-Journalen. She was called to do civil defence duty, but refused to participate and was jailed at Långholmen Prison in Stockholm for one month. She wrote of her period in prison in her book Dagbok från Långholmen (Diary of Långholmen) (1956). Alving was inspired as a journalist, feminist and pacifist by Elin Wägner. She collected biographical material after Wägner's death in 1949, which later became a biography written by Ulla Isaksson and Erik Hjalmar Linder. She published a number of books, including an annual volume of collected newspaper columns under the pseudonym \\"Käringen mot strömmen\\" (\\"old woman against the current\\", alluding to a 12th- century Swedish proverb); these were published from 1946 to 1973. She also wrote several screenplays, and was awarded the Nios Grand Prize in 1975. The feminist magazine Bang is named after her. Gallery File:Bangb256 129562a.jpgBarbro Alving, 1939.

It can grow to heights of , although it seldom exceeds more than 1 m in height. It produces small white/green coloured flowers and small edible red fruit. The plant is native to desert areas of northern Africa, where it grows in primary succession on barren sand dunes, and in areas with high salinities such as salt marshes. Description Nitraria retusa is a bush growing to a maximum height of about . The twigs are furry when young, with the bluish-grey fleshy leaves being alternate, wedge or sickle-shaped, with entire margins and measuring by . The small, sweetly-scented, whitish or greenish flowers have short pedicels and parts in fives. The fruit is a triangular drupe, in diameter. Distribution and habitat This plant is native to North and East Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East. It typically grows in salt marshes and semi-arid saline areas of deserts and it can help in the stabilisation of loose soils. Ecology In the Moghra Oasis, N. retusa plays an important role in the stabilisation of sand dunes. Here it is the dominant plant in some zones, forming hummocks known as nabkhas, where windblown materials heap up at the base of the plants. It shows a range of tolerances toward soil salinity and the availability of water. Near the lake, where salinity is low and the water table high, it associates with the sea rush, the common reed, salt grass and Zygophyllum album. At the outer fringe of the vegetated zone, where the salinity is high and the water table deep, it grows with Z.album and the Nile tamarisk. Uses The fruit turns red as it ripens and is enjoyed by humans and wildlife, which spread the seed. Camels and goats feed on the succulent leaves of this plant and desert-dwellers have used it as a source of salt. The wood is used for fuel and the fruits are sometimes used to make an intoxicating drink. N. retusa is one of a number of salt-tolerant plants that are being investigated as potential fodder crops for livestock.

The boys were to learn reading writing and arithmetick (sic), and the girls reading, writing, spinning, knitting and sewing. A set of clothes rather like the more well-known Blue Coat School was provided for the children and so it became sometimes known as the Green School. Every Whit Monday the children paraded outside the lychgate of Winkfield Church to be given new uniforms. The school was then run by John Boyce from 1759 to 1772 and later his son George from 1772 to 1824. In 1709 the hours of the school were in summer 7 a.m. – 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. – 5 p.m., and winter 8 a.m. – 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. – 4 p.m. Attendance was often poor, and many pupils were expelled for non-attendance, in 1769 15% were expelled for this reason. Earlier there were no school holidays, in 1820 there were four weeks in August, one week at Christmas and Easter, and a week at Whitsun was added in 1824. The front door opens into a full-height hall, originally a chapel, which has stained glass windows at the far end. The master's rooms were at the back with rooms in each wing to house the children. In the 1830s the single storey wings were made double storey. By 1880 the school had reached a capacity of 100 and Cranbourne Hall was sold. The school expanded to a site in Lovel Road and became known as Cranbourne Ranelagh School. =Foundation= In 1908 some of the proceeds from the sale of the Hall were used to establish a grammar school in Bracknell. This became the highly regarded Ranelagh Church of England School. Cranbourne Hall was demolished in 2008. Ranelagh opened as a secondary school and pupil-teacher centre on its present site in Bracknell in 1908. The school was partly funded by the Ranelagh Foundation, a charitable trust, which had been involved in education in the ancient parish of Winkfield since the founding of the original school in 1709. When the school opened in Bracknell, there were four full time teachers including the first headmaster, Ernest Cleave. By the outbreak of World War II the number on roll had risen to one hundred and there were then eight full time teachers including the second headmaster, James Bury. An additional playing field had been purchased in Larges Lane. During the war there were, at one time, two schools sharing the use of the buildings. The coming of the New Town and changes in national educational policy led to a major expansion of the school between 1953 and 1981 under the headships of Donovan Martin and Richard Allen. =Grammar school= The school became a Church of England voluntary aided grammar school following the Education Act 1944. Extensions were made to the buildings between 1955 and 1964, and between 1979 and 1981. =Current establishment= The school became an academy in August 2011. It was awarded Beacon School Status and is a Specialist College in Maths, Visual Arts and Business & Enterprise. In February 2006, the school received an outstanding OFSTED report and has been included in HMCI Annual Report (for the second time) as one of the most successful schools in the country.Ranelagh 6th Form Prospectus 2015 Ranelagh received its fourth Outstanding Ofsted report in 2015 under the leadership of Mrs Beverley Stevens.

Although a few writers believe the film features Young Deer's wife, Lillian St. Cyr, otherwise known as Princess Red Wing as \\"White Fawn\\", the lead woman does not fit St. Cyr's description. The movie was shot in New Jersey at 24fps. White Fawn's Devotion is the earliest surviving film directed by a Native American. It was one of the earlier films shot in America by the French company Pathé.New York Dramatic Mirror, May 7, 1910. The Mirror reported Pathé's first film shot in the US to be The Girl from Arizona. A reviewer in the New York Dramatic Mirror wrote that the film \\"proves to be interesting if we can forget the New Jersey scenery\\" and noted that \\"it is not quite clear where the devotion comes in, nor of what it consists.\\"New York Dramatic Mirror, June 25, 1910. In 2008, the movie was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot When a settler in the Dakotas gets word that he is to inherit a large fortune, his Native American wife is upset. Believing that she will lose her husband if he returns East, she stabs herself with a knife. Her husband finds her and removes the knife, but their daughter sees him with the knife in his hand and her apparently dead mother.Plot summary of White Fawn's Devotion by Snow Leopard, IMDB The girl, believing her father committed the murder, alerts the nearby Indian village. Several Indians then engage the settler in a long chase. When the settler is captured, the Indians intend to put him to death until White Fawn miraculously revives and informs the Indians of the truth. This ending, in which an interracial couple ends up together, is a rare occurrence for this period of film production. Production James Young Deer (also known as J. Younger Johnston or James Young Johnson), the uncredited director and writer of White Fawn's Devotion, was believed to be the first Native American film director. His ancestors were members of the Nanticoke people of Delaware. Young Deer was hired by Pathé Frères as a director and scenario writer and frequently worked in collaboration with his actress wife Lillian St. Cyr, also known by her stage name Princess Red Wing. Out of the more than 100 short and a few feature films he made, White Fawn's Devotion is one of fewer than 10 films of Young Deer's to have survived.

He was born in Paris, the son of a Russian-Jewish émigré tailor. Lapidus was considered the creator and pioneer of the unisex fashion look and is credited with introducing a military and safari look into haute couture. He is credited as the first designer to put Military style shoulder straps on both male and female clothing, and with making blue jeans part of the mainstream of fashion design. After an apprenticeship with Dior, Lapidus started his own fashion label in 1951, and gained prominence in the 1960s when French celebrities such as Brigitte Bardot, Françoise Hardy and Alain Delon started wearing his creations. Lapidus proved influential outside France, too, and was the first designer to persuade Twiggy to wear a suit and tie rather than a mini-skirt. John Lennon was another admirer and in 1969 he asked Lapidus to design a white leather bag to house a set of fourteen erotic lithographs he had made. Known as \\"Bag One\\", the limited edition of 300 bags incorporated zips, handles and a lock, as well as Lennon's signature in black, and was hand-stitched in Italy and later autographed by the Beatle. Lapidus also designed the white suit that Lennon wore on the cover of The Beatles' Abbey Road album. He was admitted to the Chambre syndicale de la haute couture parisienne in 1963. He designed the safari suit, a style of men's suit that was popular in Australia in the 1970s. In the late 1970s the Lapidus label started to produce fashion accessories as the haute couture market declined. In 1989 Ted Lapidus's son Oliver Lapidus took over the Lapidus label. Lapidus sponsored the French Automobiles Gonfaronnaises Sportives Formula One auto racing team in 1990 via the Ted Lapidus product name. In 1996 Lapidus designed both the home and away uniforms for the Sport Club Corinthians Paulista, which were used that year in the Copa Libertadores and the Copa Conmebol. In 2000 the Lapidus label ceased producing haute couture and is now primarily known for its fashion accessories of watches and fragrances. Lapidus died in Cannes, aged 79, from pulmonary complications brought on by leukaemia. He is buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. French President Nicolas Sarkozy paid tribute and said Lapidus had \\"democratised French elegance and classicism\\" and \\"made fashion accessible to men and women in the street.\\" Sarkozy's statement called him \\"the poet of French couture\\". Lapidus was married twice. He is survived by two sons, Olivier and Thomas, and a daughter, Eloise. ReferencesExternal links *Ted Lapidus: A life in fashion.

Local Club  Theta Upsilon began as a local club at the University of California, Berkeley. Six female students moved into a house on Walnut Street. The house became known as \\"The Walnut Shell\\". In the academic year of 1913- 1914, twelve girls organized an official \\"house club\\" under the university. It was called Mekatina, which meant \\"Among the Hills\\". Mekatina had a ritual based on Native American themes. The pin was a rising sun. The formal founding date, according to Delta Zeta's history, is January 1, 1914.  National Fraternity  On February 7, 1921, the Mekatina students became members of the Alpha chapter of Theta Upsilon. Ida Shaw Martin, of the Sorority Service Bureau, had outlined the plans for Theta Upsilon and perfected the ritual. Theta Upsilon installed many chapters across the country. Early in its history, the fraternity merged with Lambda Omega and Alpha Sigma Delta sororities. Lambda Omega began as the Norroena club at Berkeley in 1915. The name meant \\"Breath of the North\\" and the ritual was based on Native American and Norse values. The Norse values emphasized were hardihood, hospitality, economy, and friendship. Lambda Omega was an associate member of the National Panhellenic Conference. In 1932, Lambda Omega merged with Alpha Sigma Delta, which began as the Iaqua club at Berkeley in 1919. In 1932, Lambda Omega was absorbed by Theta Upsilon. On May 6, 1962, Theta Upsilon fraternity was officially absorbed by Delta Zeta sorority.https://www.deltazetaarchive.org/wp- content/uploads/2019/03/Spring_1990.pdf, p. 16.

The Chané proper who lived in eastern Bolivia and the Guaná who lived in Paraguay and adjacent Brazil. Twenty-first century survivors of the Chané are the Izoceno people of Bolivia and 3,034 descendants reported in Argentina by the 2010 census. Survivors of the Guaná are the Tereno and the Kinikinao both of Mato Grosso do Sul province in Brazil.Censo Nacional de Poblacion, Hogares y Viviendas,\\" https://www.indec.gov.ar/ftp/cuadros/poblacion/censo2010_tomo1.pdf , accessed 18 Dec 2017 Most of the historical Chané were subjects of and absorbed by the Eastern Bolivian Guarani, commonly called Chiriguanos, while the Guaná were subjects of the Mbayá, a Guaycuruan speaking people. History The Chané, together with other Arawak groups, are believed to have originated in northeastern South America, but to have spread southward about 2,500 years ago. They developed an agrarian culture, built densely populated villages, cultivated corn, peanuts, cotton and squash, and are famous for their ceramics and graphics which have been found mainly in the pampas of Bolivia surrounding the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra and in Samaipata, Portachuelo, Valle Abajo, Okinawa, Cotoca, El Pari, Mataral and Warnes.Tras la Huella de los Chané, El Deber, June 1, 2003 They also craft wooden masks and fabric clothing. An ancient Chané religious site dating from about 300 CE is El Fuerte de Samaipata, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.. Accessed 23 Sep 2016 They were a rather peaceful culture and traded with the Quechua-speaking Incas in the Andes and with other Arawak-speaking groups to the north and east. Chanés and Incas established a truce to join forces against the Eastern Guarani peoples of the Andes foothills, who the Incas and Spaniards called Chiriguanos. The Chiriguanos raided the Chané homeland on a regular basis, and prior to the Spanish conquest, the Chiriguanos defeated the Chanés and halted the Inca advance into the plains and valleys of what is now the Santa Cruz Department of Bolivia. Some Chane were forced into slavery by the Chiriguanos, others migrated to less fertile regions to the southeast. Many Chané women were taken as wives by Chiriguano men, thus starting a process of assimilation. Both Guaraní and Guaraní-speaking Chané also assimilated and mixed with Europeans during the colonial period and after the independence of both Argentina and Bolivia. The Guaná The Guaná, (also called Layaná) are the eastern branch of the Chané. They were vassals of the Mbayá, a relationship that, according to Spanish accounts, existed in 1548, and possibly much earlier.Santos-Granero, Fernando (2009), Vital Enemies, Austin: University of Texas Press, p. 38. Downloaded from Project Muse. The Guaná were agricultural and pedestrian as opposed to the nomadic Mbayá who became equestrians by the early 17th century. In the early 18th century the Guaná lived in seven large villages of 1,000 or more people on the western side of the Paraguay River between 19 and 22 south latitudes. Later in the 18th century, some of them migrated along with the Mbayá east of the Paraguay River. They were estimated, perhaps generously, in the early 18th century to have numbered 18,000 to 30,000. In 1793 they numbered about 8,200.Steward, pp. 239-240 The Guaná provided Mbayá chiefs with labor, agricultural products, textiles, and wives and in exchange were given protection and European goods such as iron tools by the Mbayá. The cultures of the Guaná and Mbayá slowly became more similar as the Mbayá adopted agriculture and weaving and the Guaná became equestrian. The Mbayá augmented their numbers, strictly limited by late marriages and abortion, by intermarriage with Guaná and captive women of other ethnic groups.Saegar, pp. 18, 87-88, 116 Spanish chroniclers describe the Guaná as docile. The Mbayá, arrogant and ethnocentric, were described by Spanish chroniclers as surprisingly benign and respectful in dealing with their Guaná subjects.Hemming, John (1978), Red Gold: The Conquest of the Brazilian Indians, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, pp 394-395 In the late 18th century the Guaná, along with the Mbayá, migrated east of the Paraguay River, and by 1850 the Guaná had broken their relationship with the Mbayá and were living in the area of Miranda, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. The largest sub-tribe of the Guaná was the Tereno who numbered 3 to 4 thousand at the time.Steward, Julian H. (1946), Handbook of South American Indians, Volume 1, The Marginal Tribes, Washington: Smithsonian Institution, pp 238-241 In 2001, they were called the Terêna, and 16,000 if them were living in the same area.\\"Terêna\\", http://www.ethnologue.com/18/language/ter/, accessed 28 Dec 2017 Distribution There are some Chané communities still living in the Izozog region in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, and in Yacui and Che-Renda near Tartagal, Argentina.Glosario de lenguas indígenas sudamericanas, Edgardo Civallero, Universidad Nacional de Córdoba In both cases, they have been influenced by the Guaraní language and culture, but still retain their Chane identity. The other descendants of the Chane culture were first mixed with the Guaranis, later with the Spaniards, and in the last two centuries with migration flows of other Europeans, Arabs, and migrants from other parts of Bolivia and Argentina.

The most problematic stretch of the highway lies between Chita and Khabarovsk. The first section of this route, linking Belogorsk to Blagoveshchensk ( in length), was constructed by gulag inmates as early as 1949. Extended and updated between 1998 and 2001, this road forms part of the Asian route AH31 connecting Belogorsk to Dalian in China. The section of the Chita–Khabarovsk road known as the Zilov Gap remained largely unfinished and was known during semiannual mud seasons to be notoriously difficult to traverse. During the last week of May and the first three weeks of June in 2004 Jim Oliver and Dennis ONeil rode motorcycles across Russia, along the Trans-Siberian Highway. As described in Jim Oliver's book, Lucille and The XXX Road, the section between Chita and Khabarovsk was an extremely challenging undertaking. Oliver writes about the massive marsh, gravel, rock, mud, sand, washboard, pot-holes, stream fording, and detours of the elusive highway with a noticeable absence of pavement.

Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin promotes the Lada Kalina brand by driving through the recently opened Amur Highway in 2010 In early 2004, Russian President Vladimir Putin symbolically opened the Amur Highway, with great swaths of forest separating major portions from one another. The St. Petersburg Times reported in September 2010 that paving of the highway had been completed. At a videoconference marking the event, Putin described it as \\"a dependable, modern farm road, but not the Autobahn\\".

He had five books published by Heath Cranton Ltd within a seven-year span (1931–38) before his death in 1940. In recent years a collection of his writings has been published, and other memorials created, including plaques in Cleobury Mortimer, where he lived for 14 years, and a 28-km walk based on his postal round stretching from Cleobury Mortimer deep into the South Shropshire countryside. Early life Simon Evans was born at Tynyfedu, Wales, not far from Lake Vyrnwy, a reservoir supplying water to Liverpool. His father, Ellis Evans, was a farmer, but the family farm was too poor to support a growing number of sons, so Ellis and his family left Wales for Birkenhead on Merseyside around 1907. Simon, tall for his age, and speaking with a strong Welsh accent, did not have an easy time at school, but did owe his love of literature to an influential teacher. When he left school, he worked for the General Post Office as a messenger boy and postman. War service On the outbreak of the First World War, Evans joined the 16th Battalion of the Cheshire Regiment, and was ultimately promoted Sergeant by age 20. He spent much of the next five years in trench warfare, an experience which left him mentally and physically scarred. He was wounded and invalided back to England at least once, and finally wounded in both legs and gassed in the summer of 1918. Although he regained use of his legs, resisting advice to have them amputated, his chest was left permanently damaged.Part of special report on World War I in Shropshire. Title refers to a beer brewed by Hobson's brewery of Cleobury Mortimer, called \\"Postman's Knock\\". Life after WWI Evans returned to Merseyside after an operation on his wounded legs, but found himself unable to settle down to the life of an urban postman. Gas damage to his lungs meant he still had to spend time in convalescent homes, and on one occasion was advised to take a walking holiday before returning to his work as a postman. This holiday he took in or near Cleobury Mortimer, and there he found a postman willing to exchange a rural postal round for Simon's urban one. With some difficulty, an exchange was arranged, and Evans took up work in Cleobury Mortimer in 1926. Cleobury Mortimer His new life in Cleobury Mortimer suited him perfectly. He later claimed that as a country postman he knew many more people than he had known when working in a town. At the time, the GPO provided rural walking postmen with shelter huts at the further point of their rounds, and Evans took full advantage of his, turning it into a place where he could read, write, and even spend the nights when off duty. In 1928, he won a scholarship offered by the Union of Post Office Workers to enroll on a correspondence course in English at Ruskin College, Oxford. This was to prove a turning point in his career, as it opened the door to literature, and led to his becoming a published writer and a broadcaster. Evans' settling in Cleobury created a new focus for his family, and he was later joined by his mother and several siblings, probably after the death of his father. However, no descendants of this family now reside in the town. Literary work Starting as a writer of short articles, largely about rural life as experienced by a country postman, Evans soon caught the attention of the BBC and became a regular contributor to programmes on the Midland Service. His broadcasts were heard by Shannie, the daughter of the publisher Heath Cranton who suggested to her father that Evans' work would be worth publishing in book form. A meeting between Cranton, Evans, and Rev. Rope (one of Cranton's existing authors) was arranged, and this resulted in the publication of Evans' first book on 20 March 1931. This was a collection of short items, most of which had already appeared in print or on the air. It was followed by his second book the following year, and three more in the next few years. His first book, Round About the Crooked Steeple, was the most successful, and the only one to be reprinted, the first reprint being dated 9 April 1931, only 20 days after the first impression. Throughout the 1930s, not only did Evans continue to work as a postman, but he also continued to write for periodicals, mostly local, but also occasionally for national weekly magazines and even daily newspapers. He often re-wrote or re-worked earlier pieces, and re- submitted these for publication elsewhere. A particular idea or anecdote, therefore, might appear in several publications, might also be broadcast on the BBC, and finally end up in one of his books. Four of his books were largely collections of articles which had already been published and broadcast pieces, but one, Applegarth, was a full-length novel, and one which was so constructed as to admit of a sequel, should the opportunity arise. Although sometimes referred to as a poet, Evans wrote little poetry, though frequently quoted poems by others in his books. His biographer, Mark Baldwin, has argued that Evans was more of a craftsman than an imaginative writer. Marriage and death His frequent visits to the BBC studio in Birmingham brought Evans into contact, through a letter she had written him in 1937 asking if he was a genuine postman, with a professional singer and entertainer, Doris Aldridge; she was working at the time in children's radio as \\"Aunty Doris\\". They were married in 1938, and lived in a house in Cleobury Mortimer, built to their own design. Less than two years later, Evans, who had given up his postal work in 1939, was badly affected by his recurring lung trouble, resulting most likely from the mustard gassing he suffered in the First World War, and died in Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham on 9 August 1940, the day before what would have been his 45th birthday. He was cremated at nearby Lodge Hill Cemetery and his ashes scattered on Abdon Burf, in the Cleobury neighbourhood. There were no children of the marriage, and his widow soon left Cleobury Mortimer to pursue her professional career. She never remarried, and died in 2006.

It was simply referred to as property (H) in a list of properties for normed spaces that starts with (A) and ends with (H). This list was given by K. Fan and I. Glicksberg (Observe that the definition of (H) given by Fan and Glicksberg includes additionally the rotundity of the norm, so it does not coincide with the Radon-Riesz property itself). The \\"Riesz\\" part of the name refers to Frigyes Riesz. He also made some use of this property in the 1920s. It is important to know that the name \\"Kadets-Klee property\\" is used sometimes to speak about the coincidence of the weak topologies and norm topologies in the unit sphere of the normed space. Examples 1\\\\. Every real Hilbert space is a Radon–Riesz space. Indeed, suppose that H is a real Hilbert space and that (x_{n}) is a sequence in H converging weakly to a member x of H. Using the two assumptions on the sequence and the fact that :\\\\langle x_{n} - x, x_{n} - x\\\\rangle = \\\\langle x_{n} , x_{n} \\\\rangle - \\\\langle x_{n} , x\\\\rangle - \\\\langle x, x_{n} \\\\rangle + \\\\langle x, x\\\\rangle, and letting n tend to infinity, we see that :\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}{\\\\langle x_{n} - x, x_{n} - x\\\\rangle} = 0. Thus H is a Radon–Riesz space. 2\\\\. Every uniformly convex Banach space is a Radon-Riesz space. See Section 3.7 of Haim Brezis' Functional analysis.

He was one of notable personalities in the time of beginnings of Slovak cinematography. Life He was born in Banská Bystrica, then part of Austria-Hungary. At the start he played amateur theatre in Banská Bystrica. In the role of Jánošík eponymous game by Jiří Mahen, Karol Plicka noticed him and recommended for the title role in the film Jánošík (1936) to Martin Frič. It was the second film of the legendary story about the famous highwayman. The success of the film led Bielik to a professional theatrical career in the Slovak National Theatre. (1939 - 1941). During the war, he began to deal with short films and in 1945 he became a director of feature films. After his debut he starred in several other films of this important director (Hordubalové, Čapkove poviedky). During the filming of the movie directed by Frinč, which was first ever movie produced in Slovakia, 'Varúj!', Bielik was his co-director and also played one of the main characters. During the war Paľo Bielik began shooting short films, and later devoted himself to the creation of successful full-length shots. Along with Karol Krško he filmed a documentary film 'For freedom', in which were used footage of the Slovak National Uprising. Bielik worked with an authentic material on his first feature film, 'Vlčie diery', made 1948. The Union of Czechoslovak Army and guerrillas assisted him in creating the film. In the film played a team of excellent actors like Ladislav Slovak Chudík, Joseph Budský, Francis Dibarbora, Ťapák Martin and many others. To the theme of war Paľo Bielik returned in movie 'Štyridsaťštyri' made in 1957. As an award of this movie he received a special honorable mention and the FIPRESCI Prize at the 11th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in 1958. In 1959 he made the legendary film Captain Dabač, in main role with Ladislav Chudík. In the sixties, Paľo Bielik revived Jánošík in the third film version, which is the jewel of Slovak cinematography. Movie filmed in 1962 and 1963 on the occasion of the 250th Jánošík death anniversary. The last movies of Paľo Bielik as a movie director were the dramatic story of Master Executioner (1966) and Three witnesses 1968. The films of Slovak actor and director were mostly ballad stories of strong, vibrant characters, mostly ended fatally.

Dates  * Completion of the Kräutelstein bridge from the Innstadt over the Danube: 1903 * Opening of the Passau–Hauzenberg line: 25 November 1904 * Opening of the Erlau–Obernzell line: 15 May 1909 * Opening of the Obernzell–Wegscheid line: 1 December 1912 * Closure of the Obernzell-Wegscheid line: 28 January 1965, dismantled in spring 1975. * On 24 November 2007 the Bavarian Regional Railway rented the Passau–Hauzenberg railway and the Erlau- Obernzell section, and announced that they would be opened again.  The granite route  The originally planned course for this railway was quite different. In 1895 the intention was for a line that branched off the Freyung railway at Fischhaus and ran via Büchlberg and Hauzenberg to Wegscheid. This would have entailed a long detour and a climb of 130 metres. Because the costs would have been too high, a link between Wegscheid and Hauzenberg was not essential, the present-day route was proposed. Approval for its construction was issued on 30 June 1900.  The Passau–Erlau–Hauzenberg railway  The Kräutelstein bridge Between Passau Hauptbahnhof and the suburb of Voglau the railway shares its tracks with Wels–Passau railway. Due to the restricted amount of space the railway branches shortly before Maximilians bridge (a railway bridge over the Inn) with into a backshunt (Spitzkehre, see table photo) at the 1.0 km marker. From there it runs along the Inn on the edge of the village of Innstadt over the Rosenau until just before the border with Austria at Achleiten. It was here between 1900 and 1903 that the Kräutelstein bridge was built over the Danube by the firms of Hellinger and MAN. From now on railway passengers could enjoy the full splendour of the Danube to their left as they travelled through Löwmühle (formerly a halt) to Erlau. From here the line climbed uphill alongside the Erlau river to Hauzenberg. The station at Erlau was only provided with one platform, which was not helpful for the subsequent crossing of trains from Wegscheid and Hauzenberg. Just as difficult was the working service. The railway reached Schaibing station through a 34 m long tunnel, but the village of Schaibing was a long way off and the station and this acted mainly as a loading and unloading site for goods from and to the surrounding villages. The line continued up the Erlau valley as far as Kaindlmühle and from here it followed the Staffelbach stream to Oberdiendorf. However the village was on the hill, the station in the valley, and goods were transported to the station using a cable car. The railway then ran through the woods via Knödlsöd (former halt at 23.5 km), past Freiflächen, to Hauzenberg. On 18 April 1904 the first train ran from Passau to Erlau. Hauzenberg lies at a height of 177.7 m above the Passau Hauptbahnhof, so inclines of 1:50 from Erlau and 1:40 from Kaindlmühle had to be overcome. The climb to the Kräutelstein bridge was also steep.  The Erlau–Obernzell–Wegscheid railway  The Erlau–Obernzell railway ran picturesquely along the Danube until it swung away into the mountains towards Wegscheid at Obernzell (300 m above NN) over the viaduct (demolished in 1982). From there it entered the rack railway section between 5.67 and 9.48 km from the start, running uphill to Untergriesbach (542,7m above NN), on through curves with radii as little as 200 m, and on inclines of up to 25 promille on the adhesion section to Withterwasser (535,0 m ü. NN) in order to overcome the height difference. Next came another rack section (70 promille) from 17.29 to 19.67 km before it reached Wegscheid (574,2 m above NN). For this railway, special steam locomotives were built, even during the planning and construction stages, by the firm of Krauss in Munich. These were Class PtzL 3/4 locomotives, passenger tank engines with a rack railway system, three of the four axles being driven, with the works numbers 4101–4003, 8033. Later they were taken over by the Deutsche Reichsbahn and operated as numbers 97 101 to 104 from Bw Passau. The first loco was delivered in 1912, two more quickly followed but the fourth was not supplied until 1923. The running speed on adhesion sections of the line was just 30 km/h, and on the rack railway sections 12 km/h. With construction of the B 388 federal highway and the introduction of buses and lorries the retention of the railway was contested. Attempts were made to utilise the lines capacity better, in 1951 using Büssing road-rail buses (Schi-Stra-Bus) and in 1957 using the rack railway variant of the Uerdingen railbus, the VT97 901–903 (later Class 798 with rack drive). However, in 1960, the DB placed buses in parallel working and made plans for the line's closure. These might possibly have been rejected, however the line became impassable as the result of a rockfall on 28 January 1965 and it was dismantled in 1975. The railway would have still been important today, because granite and graphite are mined in this area. The agricultural and forestry industries transport a large amount of produce by road and the line would also have been useful for tourism. One section of the railway is, like so many branch lines today, a footpath and cycle way. The Erlau–Obernzell line still exists as does the Passau–Hauzenberg railway, but since the floods in 2002 they have been closed. The DB refuses to reactivate it; repairs to the section at Innstadt are however are manageable. This section was renewed only a few months before the flood, as can be still be seen today from the light-coloured ballast. The Passau Railway Society as well as a citizen's lobby are fighting for the retention of these lines. The station of Wegscheid has been modelled in 1:87 (HO gauge) scale as at 1955 by the Passau Railway Society and may be viewed at Passau's main station, the Hauptbahnhof.

Biography Kuznetsov started his career as a professional coppersmith and he began working as a mechanic. In 1930 graduated from the school and enrolled at the \\"Moscow Aviation College\\" where he studied part-time and worked as a mechanic. In 1933, he joined the Air Technical School in the Motor Branch of \\"VVIA of Zhukovsky\\". There he studied under Prof. Nikolai Jegorowitsch Schukowski - then the head of the department for aircraft engines research, and Kuznetsov received a degree with honors in November 1938. The topic of his diploma there was on motors: four-carburettor, 28-cylinder with a 4-star air- cooled power of 1500 hp at 3400 rpm and at an altitude of 6000 meters with two-high-speed driven centrifugal blowers. In April 1939, Kuznetsov became a member of Communist Party organization of the academy and was elected a faculty. On 4 April 1941 he successfully defended his thesis on the structural integrity of aircraft engines. In the period from July to September 1942 he trained under a senior engineer of 239 fighter division 6th air force who met George Malenkov and praised the ability of Kuznetsov and subsequently sent his deputy to become a Designer at the Ufa Aviation Plant. Here Kuznetsov worked from 1943 to 1949 first under the leadership of Klimov then as chief designer. In 1949 he was transferred to Kuybyshev (currently the City of Samara) which is headed by the State union pilot plant number 2 on the development and manufacture of advanced jet engines now known as \\"N. D. Kuznetsova Samara Scientific and Technical Complex\\". There he worked with Sergei Pavlovich Korolev, the famous Soviet rocket designer. Contributions After World War II, captured German turbine specialists were brought along with some of the gas turbines to the Soviet Union. In addition to the already established Jumo 004 and BMW 003 engines they brought along the design documents and plans of Jumo 022 project. In 1949, Kuznetsov was appointed as chief designer of jet engines at OKB-276 (\\"Experimental design bureau-276\\") and started developing turboprop designs further with the help of the German specialists. It proved to be a successful engine and was completed in 1955. The new turboprop engine, named Kuznetsov NK-12, displayed great performance and was developed up to 11,000 kW. It was used in the Antonov An-22 aircraft, A-90 Orlyonok Ekranoplane and the Tupolev Tu-95 strategic bomber among others. The later models produced around 15,000 kW. In 1954, he began work on a two-flow jet engine with afterburner, called the Kuznetsov NK-6, which was never completed. In 1957, he received the Order of Hero of Socialist Labor for his contributions. From 1959 onwards, he was also involved in the development of engines for the projected Soviet N1 moon rocket. The primary engines for the development rockets were Kuznetsov NK-15 and Kuznetsov NK-15V (later developed into Kuznetsov NK-33 and Kuznetsov NK-43). Ultimately, these designs were successful but arrived too late. By the time the bugs in this very advanced design, which to this day has the highest thrust to weight ratio of any liquid fuel rocket engine ever produced were rectified, the N1 rocket program had been cancelled.Lindroos, Marcus. THE SOVIET MANNED LUNAR PROGRAM MIT. Accessed: 4 October 2011. Several stockpiled NK-33 engines were refurbished and modified by Aerojet and used for the Orbital Sciences Antares. In the 1960s he developed aircraft engines specifically for the world's first supersonic transport aircraft to fly Tupolev Tu-144, the Kuznetsov NK-144 turbofan. This was however inefficient and replaced by the Kolesov RD-36. Based on these design experiences, the engine Kuznetsov NK-321 (also known as NK-32-1) was developed later for the supersonic, variable-geometry heavy bomber Tupolev Tu-160, which is also in the more powerful version of the Tupolev Tu-144 (version Tu-144LL). In the late 1980s OKB- 267 began the development of the fuel sipping Turbo Fan Engine Kuznetsov NK-93, which has a by-pass ratio of almost 17:1 and thus an engine of a unique design in the world.

It was available for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, Wii, Xbox 360 and iOS. Plot The game is based on the movie, which takes place after the team escapes from the pet store, Juarez and Blaster's new home, and Kip and other FBI agents, and gives players the ability to play as Darwin and Mooch to fight against Leonard Saber, the evil billionaire and his robotic \\"household appliances\\" army. The game plot differs from the movie in several key ways. Where the game picks up, Speckles is missing until the final scenes of the movie. In the video game speckles reappears immediately saying that he escaped the pet store. The video game interjects several new locations including the production center and sewers not scene in the movie. The game also ends differently, Speckles does not have a change of heart, instead Mooch destroys the machine and in the final moments of the game, Speckles hand emerges from the wreckage, implying he has survived. The PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 versions feature an anaglyph-based stereoscopic 3-D mode, and were packaged with two sets of 3-D glasses.

Her father is Jewish and her mother is an Italian immigrant. She began her acting career in high school, playing Medea in Medea and Anna in The King and I. After high school, she performed with a rock band, touring the country from 1970 to 1978. After Diamond tired of life on the road, her friend, Shelly Werk, convinced her to audition for Beach Blanket Babylon. Werk was already a cast member. Steve Silver, the creator of the show, wanted Diamond despite the objections of the dance captain. Diamond speculates, \\"I didn't look like most of the people who were in the show. I was heavyset and I think that bothered them 'cause there was a lot of dancing for me. But I can dance. Women that aren't Twiggy-thin can still dance.\\" Diamond had her first of over 10,000 performances in Beach Blanket Babylon on January 17, 1979. Diamond has played numerous roles in the show. She is best known for singing San Francisco at the end of the show wearing a tremendous hat depicting numerous San Francisco landmarks. In 1983, she performed at Davies Symphony Hall for Queen Elizabeth II. Diamond married the Beach Blanket Babylon trumpet player, Steve Salgo, in 1987. They live in Sonoma.

This tube was first proposed by a Polish limnologist named Przemysław Olszewski in 1961 and helps combat the negative effects of eutrophication, high nutrient content, in lakes. The basic concept behind the Olszewski tube is the reduction of nutrient concentration and destratification; the more specific goal is hypolimnetic withdrawal.Butusov, Mikhail, and Arne Jernelöv. Phosphorus: An Element That Could Have Been Called Lucifer. New York: Springer, 2013. Print.  Eutrophication  When nutrients build up in a lake, eutrophication occurs, and this generally occurs in the top layer of a lake. The nutrients come both naturally and artificially and usually contain phosphates. The artificial nutrients can come from sewage and fertilizers, from agricultural runoff. Phosphorus from the phosphates causes algae to grow rapidly and spread throughout the top layer of the lake. Algal blooms have negative effects on both the aesthetics and the ecology of the lake. Aesthetically, the lake is not pleasing because it is covered with algae. Ecologically, eutrophication causes organisms in the lake to die because the algae deplete the dissolved oxygen in the lake.Cooke, G. Dennis. Restoration and Management of Lakes and Reservoirs. Boca Raton, FL: CRC, 2005. Print.  Design  Working principle of an Olszewski tube (below) At the most simple level, the Olszewski tube is a pipe that spans from the bottom, hypolimnetic layer of the lake to the outlet. The outlet part of the pipe is installed under lake level in order for the device to act as a siphon. Once warm water flows in the lake at the surface, it forces the cold anoxic water of the hypolimnetic layer through and up the tube. This oxygen-poor water is then brought to the top of the lake where the eutrophication occurs. This eventually helps the lake as a whole because the bottom of the lake will have more dissolved oxygen and the top of the lake will have less eutrophication.Welch, E. B., and T. Lindell. Ecological Effects of Waste Water. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1980. Print.  Implementations  The first implementation of the Olszewski tube was attempted at Lake Kortowo in Poland and this led to oligotrophication, reduction of nutrient cycling. This tube has shown the most promise in a 3.9 meter deep eutrophic lake in Switzerland because the phosphorus and nitrogen levels in the summer drastically decreased, oxygen levels increased, and the amount of cyanobacteria decreased from 152 grams per square meter to 41 grams per square meter. It has also been reported by a scientist named Bjork that there have been successes with the Olszewski tube in European lakes. Other limnologists like Pechlaner and Gachter have reported successes in small lakes where the total phosphorus decreased, transparency of water increased, and less algae was present.Lake Restoration, Protection, and Management: Proceedings of the Second Annual Conference, North American Lake Management Society, October 26–29, 1982, Vancouver, British Columbia.O'Sullivan, P. E., and Colin S. Reynolds. The Lakes Handbook. N.p.: n.p., 2005. Print.  Complications  Some complications that can arise with the use of an Olszewski tube include disruption of the thermocline and excessive water loss. The thermocline separates the upper layer of water that is mixed temperatures with the deeper, cooler water. If the thermocline is disrupted, it could alter the ecology of the lake, potentially making it uninhabitable. Another complication is that the installation must be a long-term process. Short-term uses of Olszewski tubes have largely failed because it takes some time for the anoxic condition of the hypolimnetic layer to increase in dissolved oxygen. Also, it must be a slow process in order to avoid disrupting the thermocline in a lake. If the Olszewski tube is operated slowly enough, the rate of water going in and going out will be fairly constant causing the thermocline to stay intact.  Cost  One advantage to hypolimnetic withdrawal is that it is relatively inexpensive to install an Olszewski tube or any similar device. Along with low initial cost, it also has a relatively low annual maintenance cost. The following are four systems installed in the United States (2002), their area in hectares, the rate of flow in cube-meters per minute, and their initial installation costs in US dollars: * Lake Ballinger 41 ha 3.4 m3/min $420,000 * Lake Waramaug 287 ha 6.3 m3/min $62,000 * Devil's Lake 151 ha 9.1 m3/min $310,000 * Pine Lake 412 ha 5.3 m3/min $282,000  Other Techniques  Aside from using an Olszewski tube and hypolimnetic withdrawal, there are other techniques implemented to achieve the same goals as an Olszewski tube. These include increasing dissolved oxygen, reducing nutrient concentration, and lessening the amount of algae and unwanted biomass in lakes. * Sediment oxidation is the artificial oxidation of the top 15 to 20 centimeters of anaerobic lake sediment. This technique reduces internal nutrient release through a series of chemical reactions starting with iron(III) chloride. After these reactions, the concentrations of phosphorus and ammonium (another nutrient found in lakes) decrease and the demand for oxygen gas in reduced as well. This technique is still not fully developed yet but can mirror the effects of the Olszewski tube. * Biological control methods are the most promising techniques because they do the least harm to the ecosystem. These methods introduce a particular species (e.g. fish, bacteria, etc.) into a lake as a solution to a current problem. The introduction of a certain type of bacteria can help decrease nutrients. In turn the algae will not spread and the oxygen in the lake will stay in high dissolved concentrations. * Hypolimnetic aeration is another technique in which oxygen is added to the lake. This helps increase the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the lake as well as bring down the levels of phosphorus. While the results of this technique are similar to those of the Olszewski tube, hypolimnetic aeration differs in that it uses compressed air to move the water rather than a siphoning effect.

He died of Parkinson's disease in 2015. Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Peltason was a member of the Smith College faculty from 1947-1951 and then joined the University of Illinois-Urbana faculty. He became dean of the College of Arts and Sciences in 1960. In 1964, he left Illinois to become vice president of academic affairs at the University of California, Irvine. In 1967, he returned to Illinois to become the first chancellor of the Urbana campus and stayed there until 1977 when he returned to Irvine. Peltason served as president of political science honors society Pi Sigma Alpha from 1978 to 1980, and was also on the executive council of the society from 1970 to 1978. Peltason served as UC president for only three tumultuous years before announcing in January 1995 that he would retire that October. His relatively brief tenure was marked by two major controversies. First, in more prosperous times, UC had approved generous deferred compensation for its chancellors and other top executives which was no longer politically defensible during the early 1990s recession, and Peltason was forced to spend a great deal of time on the tasks of trimming back UC's executive salary and benefits programs and defending them to the public. Second, in 1994, Regent Ward Connerly and Governor Pete Wilson launched a campaign to prohibit the use of affirmative action in UC admissions. Despite strong opposition from Peltason and most UC senior executives (including UCSF associate dean and future UC President Michael V. Drake), Connerly and Wilson were able to persuade a majority of the Board of Regents to approve two resolutions to that effect on July 20, 1995.

Part of Operation Postern, which was undertaken to capture the Japanese base at Lae, the landing was undertaken between 4 and 6 September 1943 by Australian troops from the 9th Division, supported by US naval forces from the VII Amphibious Force. The first major amphibious operation undertaken by the Australian Army since the failed Gallipoli Campaign, the Australians invested a significant amount of effort into planning the operation. The initial landing saw one brigade and supporting elements being landed at two beaches about east of Lae. Once this brigade had secured the beachhead, a second brigade was landed to follow them up and help expand the beachhead. In the days following the landing the division's third and final brigade was brought ashore. The landing was carried out in conjunction with the airborne landing at Nadzab, and was followed by a drive on Lae by the 7th Division from Nadzab and the 9th from the landing beaches, which advanced with two brigades while one held the landing beach. Hampered by bad weather, logistical difficulties, and stiff resistance by the Japanese defenders, the 9th Division's advance stalled and ultimately troops from the 7th Division entered Lae first, entering the town on 16 September, the day before the 9th. StrategyAllied= A map depicting the Elkton III Plan, March 1943. In July 1942, the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff approved a series of operations by General Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander, South West Pacific Area (SWPA), against the Japanese bastion at Rabaul, which blocked any Allied advance along the northern coast of New Guinea toward the Philippines or north toward the main Japanese naval base at Truk. In keeping with the overall Allied grand strategy of defeating Nazi Germany first, the immediate aim of these operations was not the defeat of Japan but merely the reduction of the threat posed by Japanese base at Rabaul to air and sea communications between the United States and Australia. In 1942 and early 1943, MacArthur's forces fought off a series of Japanese offensives in Papua in the Kokoda Track campaign, Battle of Milne Bay, Battle of Buna–Gona, the Battle of Wau and the Battle of the Bismarck Sea. Following these victories, the initiative passed to the Allies. At the Pacific Military Conference in Washington, D.C., in March 1943, MacArthur's plans were reviewed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The chiefs were unable to supply all the requested resources, so the plans had to be scaled back, with the capture of Rabaul postponed to 1944. On 6 May 1943, MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) in Brisbane officially informed subordinate commands of the next phase of operations, which were to: # Occupy Kiriwina and Woodlark Islands and establish air forces thereon. # Seize the Lae–Salamaua–Finschhafen–Madang area and establish air forces therein. # Occupy western New Britain, establishing air forces at Cape Gloucester, Arawe and Gasmata. The second part was assigned to General Sir Thomas Blamey's New Guinea Force, which was a mainly Australian formation. As a result, \\"it became obvious that any military offensive in 1943 would have to be carried out mainly by the Australian Army, just as during the bitter campaigns of 1942.\\" =Japanese= In early 1942, the Japanese began making plans for the capture of the Salamaua–Lae area, which according to Kengoro Tanaka they desired as part of plans \\"to control the sea area to the east and north of Australia\\" due to the airfields located in the region. Lae was subsequently secured by a battalion of naval troops in February–March 1942. Lae was then developed into a significant forward base for Japanese aircraft, while Salamaua was invested with a naval garrison. In December that year, the Japanese began reinforcing Lae as they sought to shore up their southern flanks after the failure of operations to capture Port Moresby. By January 1943, the total strength of Japanese forces around Salamaua–Lae was around 6,500. Its strategic position, adjacent to the Solomon Sea, meant that it was the main Japanese base in the region, and throughout 1943 plans were made to hold both Lae and Salamaua. By 1943, the Japanese maintained separate army and navy headquarters at Rabaul which cooperated with each other but were responsible to different higher authorities. Naval forces came under the Southeast Area Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral Jinichi Kusaka. Army forces came under General Hitoshi Imamura's Eighth Area Army, consisting of the XVII Army in the Solomon Islands, Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi's XVIII Army in New Guinea, and the 6th Air Division, based at Rabaul. As a result of the destruction of a convoy carrying reinforcements in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, the Japanese decided not send any more convoys to Lae, but instead to land troops at Hansa Bay and Wewak and move them forward to Lae by barge or submarine. In the long run they hoped to complete a road over the Finisterre Range and thence to Lae through the Ramu and Markham Valleys. Imamura ordered Adachi to capture the Allied bases at Wau, Bena Bena and Mount Hagen. To support these operations, Imperial General Headquarters transferred the 7th Air Division to New Guinea. On 27 July 1943, Lieutenant General Kumaichi Teramoto's Fourth Air Army was assigned to Imamura's command to control the 6th and 7th Air Divisions, the 14th Air Brigade and some miscellaneous squadrons. By June, Adachi had three divisions in New Guinea: the 41st Division at Wewak and the 20th Division around Madang, both recently arrived from Palau, and the 51st Division in the Salamaua area, a total of about 80,000 men. Of these only the 51st Division was in contact with the enemy. Like Blamey, Adachi faced formidable difficulties of transportation and supply just to bring his troops into battle. Geography Map of the advance on Lae, September 1943 Lae lies on the western base of the Huon Peninsula, on the southern side of the Huon Gulf. The area was flat, and generally well-drained. It had been developed as a port to meet the needs of the gold fields to the south, but there was no harbour, and deep water offshore meant that the anchorages were limited. The tidal range was small, with spring tides and neaps, and there were no coral reefs. The beaches to the east of Lae were suitable for landing craft. They were composed of firm black sand or shingle, and were about wide. But they had few exits, and for the most part were backed by dense jungle and mangrove swamps. There were no roads. The area was intercut by streams and rivers, the most important of which were the Burep and Busu Rivers. While neither wide nor deep, with firm, stoney bottoms, they were swift-flowing, with no fords, and so presented an obstacle to troops crossing. Planning The landing would be made by Major General George Wootten's 9th Division, veterans of the Siege of Tobruk and the First and Second Battles of El Alamein. It had returned to Australia from the Middle East after El Alamein, and been re-equipped, re-organised and re-trained for jungle operations around Kairi on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland. Training in amphibious warfare was conducted nearby at Trinity Beach in Cairns with the American 2nd Engineer Special Brigade. This brigade was a large formation, with an establishment strength of 354 officers, 16 warrant officers and 6,806 enlisted men. Each of its three boat battalions had 120 small LCVPs and 12 larger LCMs, which they assembled themselves at a facility near Cairns. The 2nd Engineer Special Brigade was trained and equipped for \\"shore-to-shore\\" operations, over a maximum distance of . Blamey briefs the news media using a scale model of the target area The original concept was for a brigade of the 9th Division to be ferried along the coastline of New Guinea from a forward base at Morobe. The more Blamey thought about the prospect of doing this under the noses of the Japanese air base at Lae, the more hazardous it seemed. In May he went back to MacArthur and obtained approval for the operation to be modified to employ the entire 9th Division, and that they be carried in additional large landing craft operated by the VII Amphibious Force. Also known as Task Force 76, this was part of the US Navy's Seventh Fleet. It was commanded by Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey, and operated large ocean-going landing ships such as the LST, LCI and LCT. The ships' greater range meant that the entire force could stage at Milne Bay and travel directly to Lae from there. In July and August 1943, the 9th Division moved up to Milne Bay, where Barbey had already established his headquarters on board the . As it was the first significant amphibious operation mounted by Australian forces since Gallipoli, extensive planning was put into the capture of Lae. Indeed, it was the first major operation for which the Australian Army was able to conduct long term forward planning, with deliberate planning beginning six months prior. Wooten deliberately chose landing sites beyond the range of Japanese artillery in Lae. \\"Red Beach\\" was to the east of the mouth of the Busu River, east of Lae, and \\"Yellow Beach\\" near Malahang. This was the first time in SWPA that beaches were designated with colours. The left end of the beach was marked with a solid red panel mounted on tent poles, the right with one alternating red and white. At night, the left would have a red light, and the right one alternating red and white. Yellow beach was marked the same way, with yellow instead of red. Maps and models of the landing sites were made, and kept closely guarded. Soldiers were made familiar with models of the beaches where they would be landing, but the names were kept secret. Rehearsals were conducted on Normanby Island. Order of arrival of landing craft and stores on Red and Yellow Beaches A series of meetings involving Wooten, Barbey, Edmund Herring (Wooten's superior as commander of I Corps), Colonel Merian C. Cooper from the Fifth Air Force, and Air Commodore Joe Hewitt from the RAAF, reached agreement, or at least compromise, on many points. Wooten wanted at least 10 days' reserve rations. This meant that some stores would have to be transported in bulk, and not pre-loaded on trucks as Barbey initially wanted. Loading the stores onto trucks was an inefficient use of shipping space, but permitted quick unloading of the LSTs, as the trucks could simply be driven off. The 9th Division did not have sufficient trucks for this, but 200 trucks earmarked for the US Advanced Base at Lae were borrowed from USASOS. Barbey would not allow loaded vehicles on the tank decks of the LSTs, as this was a fire hazard, so bulk stores were carried there instead. Ammunition requirements were based on experience in the desert, there being no reliable data on usage in SWPA due to acute supply difficulties. Some of ammunition was drawn from the 10th Advanced Ammunition Depot at Milne Bay for the 25-pounders of the 2/12th Field Regiment and the Bofors 40 mm guns of the 2/4th Light Antiaircraft Regiment. The 9th Division also had two shore fire control parties from the 1st Australian Naval Bombardment Group to coordinate naval gunfire support, who had been specially trained at the Flinders Naval Depot in Victoria. Wooten initially wanted a night landing, which would give tactical surprise and maximise the time for unloading the landing ships before Japanese aircraft put in an appearance; but there would be no moon on 4 September, so Barbey was uncertain that he would be able to correctly locate the beaches. H-Hour was therefore set at 06:30, which was twenty minutes after sunrise. Because the air force had commitments to support the 7th Division's landing at Nadzab the following day, air cover would not be available in the afternoon. Barbey therefore wanted the ships to depart at 11:00. This raised the question of whether the ships could be unloaded in just 4½ hours. Barbey gave assurances that unloading would continue even under Japanese air attack. For Australian officers with memories of the Tobruk Ferry Service, where the Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy had lost 25 ships keeping the port's garrison supplied, the US Navy's attitude was not good enough. A key part of Blamey's plan was for Australian and US forces to maintain pressure on the Japanese garrison around Salamaua to the south-west in the lead up to the landing in an effort to draw Japanese reinforcements away from Lae. In this they were completely successful; the Japanese 51st Division continued to reinforce the position around Salamaua, with thousands of Japanese troops, including elements of several infantry regiments and an artillery regiment, being moved to the area throughout the campaign. Allied intelligence estimated that there were 7,250 Japanese soldiers in Lae, of whom 5,100 were in combat units. BattleLanding= Brigadier Victor Windeyer's 20th Infantry Brigade departed Milne Bay on 2 September. The first waves were carried in destroyer transports (APDs), old destroyers that had been converted to use as high-speed amphibious ships; the , , and . Amphibian engineer scouts from the 2nd Engineer Special Brigade's 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment (EBSR) accompanied them. The rest of the 20th Infantry Brigade travelled less comfortably in the VII Amphibious Force's LCIs and LSTs. The Fifth Air Force carried out raids on the Japanese bases at Madan on 1 September and Wewak on 2 September in support of the operation, sinking a couple of merchant ships totalling 10,000 tons in Wewak harbour. The convoy stopped for a few hours at Buna on 3 September, where men on the LCIs were allowed to disembark. At around 12:15, nine Japanese Betty bombers attacked the landing craft at Morobe, but inflicted no damage or casualties. On the night of 3/4 September, the final voyage to the landing beaches began. The landing was preceded by a short naval bombardment from five US destroyers. It was unopposed by Japanese land forces, with the small number of Japanese that were guarding the shore choosing to abandon their posts rather than fight. The US 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment lays beach mats to allow vehicles to move along the sand. LST-468 and LCT-174 unload in the background. There was resistance from the air, though. As the fifth wave of seven LCIs was coming in to Red Beach, they were attacked by six Zeke fighters and three Betty bombers that dropped twelve bombs. One hit the deck of USS LCI-339 forward of the conning tower; another two were near misses. Badly damaged and riddled by bullets and fragments, the ship caught fire. LCI-339 remained on the beach, where she served as a landmark for Japanese aircraft. She was eventually towed off the beach, but then drifted onto a reef and became a total loss. USS LCI-341 suffered a near miss that tore a huge hole in its side. Eight Australians were killed, including Lieutenant Colonel R. E. Wall, the commanding officer of the 2/23rd Infantry Battalion, and 45 were wounded. The landing operation continued despite the air attacks and within four hours of the first landing craft being lowered into the water, around 8,000 men had been put ashore. During the initial phase of the landing the 2/13th Infantry Battalion landed at Yellow Beach securing the beachhead, after which it pushed patrols to the west, to link up with the 2/15th Infantry Battalion – which had landed at Red Beach – before advancing east towards the Hopoi Mission Station to secure the right flank of the Allied lodgement. The 2/17th Infantry Battalion came ashore on Red Beach behind the 2/15th, and pushed itself towards the west to force its way across the Buso River, and establish a beachhead on its opposite bank. The 26th Infantry Brigade then followed the 20th Brigade ashore, conducting a passage of lines with the 20th Brigade, moving through their position and then pushing west, temporarily assuming control of the 2/17th Infantry Battalion. Engineers laid wire mesh on the beaches, felled trees, built roads and established supply dumps. While the LSTs were unloaded quickly enough, the seven bulk loaded LCTs were not, due to insufficient troops being designated to help unloading. The last was not unloaded until 14:30. At 13:00, six LSTs heading for Red Beach were attacked by a force of about 70 Japanese aircraft. Some 48 Lockheed P-38 Lightnings were vectored to assist. USS LST-473 was rocked by two bomb hits and two near misses from Val dive bombers. Eight Americans were killed and 37 Americans and Australians wounded. USS LST-471 was torpedoed on the port side aft by a Betty bomber; 43 Americans and Australians were killed and 30 were wounded. Particularly hard hit were the commandos of the 2/4th Independent Company, which lost 34 dead and 7 wounded. The remaining ships continued to Red Beach, arriving on schedule at 23:00. On their way back USS LST-452 and LST-458 took the two crippled LSTs in tow, and brought them back to Morobe. They then took on their cargo, and later took it to Red Beach. The wounded were taken to Buna by Humphreys.Commander, VII Amphibious Force, Action Report on Lae Operation 1–12 September 1943, NAA: B6121/3 74B Japanese aircraft attacked the beach at 15:30. An ammunition dump exploded and a fuel dump was set on fire. The 532nd EBSR lost one man killed and 12 wounded. The following day, after the 26th Brigade had advanced the beachhead about from the initial lodgement, the divisional reserve – the 24th Infantry Brigade – was brought ashore on the evening of 5/6 September. In the days following the landing, the Australians advanced with two brigades forward: the 24th on the coast and the 26th about inland. On the right of the 26th Brigade, flank security was provided by the 2/4th Independent Company, while the 20th Brigade remained behind to secure the beachhead. =Advance on Lae= Sappers erect a pontoon bridge over the Bunga River on the track to Lae to facilitate passage of artillery Following the landing east of Lae, the 7th Division, having concentrated in Port Moresby, was flown into Nadzab following its capture by the US 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment (503rd PIR) on 5 September. Tasked with advancing from the north-west, its main role was to act as a buffer between the 9th Division and Japanese reinforcements which might try to move down through the Markham and Ramu Valleys. The 9th Division's initial advance along the coast met with limited resistance, with the largest Japanese elements being mainly company- sized. In response to the landing at Nadzab, the Japanese command ordered Lieutenant General Hidemitsu Nakano's 51st Division to reinforce Ryoichi Shoge's heavily entrenched garrison at Lae, falling back from the Salamaua region. There were numerous small creeks and rivers west of the Buso, including four major rivers and on the inland route, the 2/23rd Infantry Battalion, having crossed the Buso on the first day, began a series of what author Joseph Morgan has described as \\"treacherous river crossings and hard slogs...through the jungle\\". Pushing their way across the Bunga and Buiem Rivers, the 2/23rd fanned out through Apo village while maintaining contact with the 2/17th Infantry Battalion by signal cable. Around the Burep River, the 2/23rd was held up by the terrain and as a result the commander decided to halt and form a battalion defensive position. A platoon under Sergeant Don Lawrie was pushed forward near the mouth of the river as a protection measure to provide early warning. On 6 September, a company of Japanese attacked the 2/23rd's main defensive position south of the Singaua Plantation on the western side of the Buiem River, alongside a company from the 2/24th Battalion. Having been alerted by Lawrie's platoon who had sent back two runners, the battalion was able to repel the attack, although numerous casualties were inflicted on the 2/23rd and the 2/17th by Japanese mortars. The Japanese company, numbering about 60 men, subsequently fell back towards Lawrie's platoon near the Bunga. Positioned on the Japanese line of retreat, the Australian platoon was subjected to six attacks. These were fended off over the course of the afternoon, and by evening, as heavy rain began to fall, the Australian platoon was able to break contact and withdraw back to the 2/23rd's main defensive position. The Japanese assault on the 2/23rd subsequently delayed the 9th Division's advance for several days, and these would eventually prove significant as in that time, the rain set in, flooding the numerous waterways that forked inland from the coast. Covered with heavy fire from the opposite bank, they would prove difficult for the Australians to cross. As the advance continued, stores were pushed forward from Red Beach, and landed by LCVs and LCMs around Apo Fishing Village on 6/7 September, and then again on 7 September around the Singaua Plantation, from where both the 24th and 26th Infantry Brigades undertook a resupply before the advance continued. The going was slow, with the ground saturated, and the thick jungle and kunai grass along the route of advance delayed the troops who had to cut several tracks through the foliage. On the inland route, the 2/24th led the way towards the Burep River, while along the coast the 2/28th relieved the 2/32nd. As they reached the Burep, the two brigades separated, with the 26th advancing alongside the Burep for several miles before crossing it further inland and then driving towards the Busu. A number 6 artillery tractor tows a Bofors 40 mm gun across the Burep River on the way to Lae By 8 September, the commander of the Japanese 51st Division, Nakano, gave the order for his forces and those in Lae to begin their withdrawal northwards, as it became clear that the twin drives on the town threatened them with encirclement. The same day, though, the Australians came up against the most significant obstacle to their advance on Lae – the Busu River – which at its widest was across, and deep. Three days of heavy rain had flooded the river, making it treacherous to cross; however, the need to maintain the initiative forced the Australians to launch a hazardous crossing without bridging equipment or boats. On the coast, the 2/28th Infantry Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Colin Norman, attempted to run a cable across the river. This failed after the soldier who made the crossing was killed on the opposite bank by a squad of Japanese. Norman then shifted his focus to the mouth of the river, where there was a small central island that could be exploited to provide some cover for the assaulting troops. Covered by mortars and heavy machine guns, the Western Australians fixed bayonets and advanced in company lots, with the men strung out in extended line. The Japanese opened up with their own mortars and machine guns from well concealed positions on the opposite bank. Thirteen Australians drowned in the crossing, while dozens more were swept away and had to be rescued by troops from neighbouring units. Nevertheless, the 2/28th pushed through, subsequently securing a beachhead on the opposite bank. The weather continued to hamper the 9th Division's advance. The 26th Brigade, further inland, remained stuck on the eastern side of the Busu. On 10 September, the commandos providing flank security managed to get across the Sankwep River, close to its confluence with the Busu, pushing a kunda bridge across. Shortly afterwards, they clashed with a small party of Japanese attempting to advance towards the bridge, and several Japanese were killed. To reinvigorate the 26th, engineer support was brought up. The 2/7th Field Company was pushing a jeep track forward with the help of the 2/48th, and they subsequently arrived with boats, ropes and cables, and several attempts were made to get across, all of which eventually failed as the engineers came under fire from the opposite bank. Heavy clashes later took place as the Australians and Japanese fought desperately in the swamp around the crossing. As it became uncertain whether the 26th would be able to force their way across, a company from the 2/48th was sent south to use the 24th Brigade's crossing and then advance north along the western bank of the Busu to help secure the brigade's beachhead when it finally did get across. on 13 September further engineer stores arrived, including bridging equipment and folding boats, and the following day a Small Box Girder bridge was pushed across despite heavy fire from the opposite bank, allowing the 26th Brigade to get across the Busu on 14 September. The 26th Infantry Brigade's leading elements immediately clashed with the Japanese on the opposite bank, as they worked to push two battalions towards Kamkamun and the Malahang Mission, to secure the sawmill to the south- west and the northern end of the Malahang airfield. Meanwhile, the 24th Infantry Brigade had pushed the 2/28th along the coast with a view advancing towards Malahang Anchorage, while the 2/32nd and 2/43rd invested Wagan to the south of Malahang airfield. In addition to the weather, the Allied supply situation also proved problematic, with the geography making resupply efforts difficult, while service politics led to arguments between military and naval commanders developing over misunderstandings about the capabilities of the navy and the risks involved in operating close to the shore. These factors combined to stymie the 9th Division's progress and as a result, the 7th Division's troops eventually beat the 9th in reaching the town, with its 25th Infantry Brigade – having fought a sharp action around Jensen's and Heath's Plantations – entering Lae on the morning of 16 September, just ahead of the 24th Infantry Brigade, which had taken the airfield around Malahang the day before. Base development Liberty ships unload at the docks at Lae in March 1944 Brigadier David Whitehead of the 26th Infantry Brigade assumed responsibility for Lae after its capture. Under his direction, garbage was burned, Japanese bodies were cremated, and bomb craters, shell holes and Japanese trench latrines were filled in. American and Australian malaria control units sprayed mosquito breeding grounds. He handed over responsibility for the town to US Brigadier General Carl W. Connell, the commander of US Base E. The advance party of Lieutenant Colonel O. A. Kessels' Australian Lae Base Sub Area headquarters arrived by air on 18 September, followed by the main body by sea on 30 September. To control the Australian and American bases, Herring created the Lae Fortress under Major General Edward Milford. Lae was not intended to be an air base, but the 9th Division wanted to use the Lae Drome for casualty evacuation and artillery spotting by No. 4 Squadron RAAF. By 18 September, it had been extended to and widened to , allowing four of No. 4 Squadron's CAC Wirraways to land. The closure of the Markham Valley Road on 7 October due to heavy rainfall meant that the airbases at Nadzab and Gusap had to be maintained by air. Fuel was shipped to Lae in 44-gallon drums, and then flown to Nadzab. At one point, there was a take off or landing at Lae Drome every 26 seconds. Only after a Herculean effort by the US 842nd Engineer Aviation Battalion was the road reopened on 15 December. Development of Lae as a port, on the other hand, was envisaged from the start; but when the town was captured, the port was blocked by sunken barges and debris. The only discharge facilities were two rickety jetties unable to hold trucks. The first cargo was delivered by LST, and brought ashore over the beach by DUKWs, LCMs and lighters. Australian and American DUKWs were operated as a common pool. Initially, the US Navy would only allow the LSTs to arrive at night, and they had to shove off before daybreak. Only in November did it allow them to operate in daylight. Sunken Japanese barges were cleared away by a 150-ton floating crane. American engineers then installed a floating dock, which was towed to Lae in sections. It opened on 20 October, and a Type C1 ship, the Cape Kreig, discharged there that day. A new dock was completed on 23 November, although it was used to unload the Liberty ship Fremont Older on 15 November. A fuel jetty was built, along with a bulk petroleum storage facility, and the first tanker discharged there on 20 November. A 4-inch pipeline was run through to Nadzab. Aftermath A Japanese gun captured by the AIF at Lae After the capture of Lae, the Japanese high command determined that a withdrawal to a new line of defence was required. A total of about 9,000 Japanese troops subsequently began withdrawing across the Busu River and then through the Saruwaged and Finisterre Ranges to the north-east coast, while efforts were made to reinforce the Huon Peninsula, with the 20th Division being transferred from Madang to Finschhafen. The Allies, who had captured a copy of Nakano's withdrawal order when troops from the 2/25th Infantry Battalion clashed with a Japanese force on 13 September, attempted to cut off the withdrawing troops and subsequently there were heavy clashes along the Markham Valley Road, with troops from the Australian 25th Infantry Brigade and 503rd PIR engaged. During the withdrawal many Japanese troops ran short of food and abandoned essential equipment, including artillery, small arms and load carriage equipment; they subsequently reached their objective in the middle of October, having lost a further 600 to 1,000 men on the march. Japanese strength returns indicated that the 51st Division had 6,417 men, of whom 1,271 were sick. The 9th Division lost 77 killed, 397 wounded and 73 missing. The Allies subsequently launched a follow up campaign on the Huon Peninsula, with a landing at Scarlet Beach by the 20th Infantry Brigade. At the same time, the 22nd Infantry Battalion, an Australian Militia unit that had landed as part of the 4th Infantry Brigade on 10/11 September to relieve the 2/13th and 2/15th Infantry Battalions around the beachhead to free them up for the advance west on Lae, followed the Japanese that were withdrawing to the east, marching from Hopoi Mission Station to Finschhafen, with a view to placing pressure on the Japanese southern flank. This feat was described by the Kalgoorlie Miner as the \\"greatest march\\" of the New Guinea campaign and in 10 days the battalion covered of rugged terrain. The 7th Division would later advance on Dumpu through the Markham and Ramu Valleys, and over the Finisterre Range on their way towards Madang during the Finisterre Range campaign. This advance, coupled with the US seizure of New Georgia gave the Allies access to vital airfields from which they were able to project air power.

Since 2018 a longer-term proposal stands, for its building, by 2043 to cater to projected population growth in the Thames Basin.  Reasons for the construction  The main reason to build is that the South-East is facing seasonal water stress. Factors are the Rain shadow behind the prevailing westerly winds and western hills. Eastern counties lack rainfall of the west; their average annual rainfall being 500-750mm. The west receives around 1800-2800mm. Average population density is higher in the eastern than western counties; London houses 13.5% of the UK's population. This is the greatest concentration of domestic water usage. Roughly 22% of water use is domestic; 75% is from all types of industry.

The toy is typically hollow with a weight inside the bottom hemisphere. The placement of this weight is such that the toy has a center of mass below the center of the hemisphere, so that any tilting raises the center of mass. When such a toy is pushed over, it wobbles for a few moments while it seeks the upright orientation, which has an equilibrium at the minimum gravitational potential energy. Different toy manufacturers and different cultures have produced different-looking roly-poly toys: the okiagari-koboshi and some types of Daruma doll of Japan, the nevаlyashka (\\"untopply\\") or van'ka-vstan'ka (\\"Ivan-get-up\\") of Russia, and Playskool's Weebles. Japanese okiagari means \\"to get up (oki) and arise (agari)\\"; the self-righting characteristic of the toy has come to symbolize the ability to have success, overcome adversity, and recover from misfortune.Kyburz, Josef A., \\"Omocha': Things to Play (or Not to Play) With\\" Asian Folklore Studies, Vol. 53, No. 1 (1994), p. 15.

The term also refers to the other emigrations (and all descendants) occurring before and after this group. However none came close to the size or importance of the Wendish culture in Texas. HistoryNineteenth century=Lusatia In 1817, King Frederick William III of Prussia ordered the Lutheran and Reformed churches in his territory to unite, forming the Evangelical Church of the Prussian Union. The unification of the two branches of German Protestantism sparked a great deal of controversy. Many Lutherans, termed Old Lutherans, chose to leave the established churches and form independent church bodies. Many left for America and Australia. The dispute over ecumenism overshadowed other controversies within German Lutheranism. The group which eventually became the Wends of Texas was part of this movement, its members distinguished in their specific ethnic identity as Wends, i.e. a Slavic minority living within a predominantly German environment.. Resisting the merger of Lutheranism and Calvinism being forced by the national church, this group, comprising members of many congregations and villages met at Dauban on March 23, 1854, to make decisions on what was to be done. Finishing the meeting it had been decided to meet again in May to call a pastor. May 25, 1854, saw the call of Pastor John Kilian as pastor of the newly formed congregation and plans began to form for the emigration to Texas. Crossing the Atlantic Converging at Hamburg, they traveled to Hull, England, where they were expecting to begin their voyage across the sea. Upon arrival they found their intention to travel on one large ship was fouled as two smaller ships awaited them. After negotiating and waiting for news to come back, their would-be ship line transported them to their requested ship among the White Star Line's line of packet ships, the Ben Nevis in Liverpool, England. Kilian's gravestone in Serbin, in German. Of particular note is the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak that this group of Wends was apparently exposed to while in Liverpool, England. After setting sail they were forced to drop anchor at Queenstown, Ireland, to have the ship quarantined and the disease complete its cycle. Continuing on they landed in Galveston, Texas, after passing the health inspection. Finding the largest city of Texas (at that time) beset by yellow fever they hurriedly continued on to Houston (then almost half the size of Galveston). By the time they left Galveston, a total of 73 had died from various ailments, chiefly though of cholera (55 died from it alone). Arrival in Texas Upon arrival in Houston, many of the Wends did not have enough money to continue the journey inland other than to travel on foot, carrying what they could. Along the way many stopped short of the congregation's aim in other German communities. Ultimately arriving in present-day Lee County, they founded the Low Pin Oak Settlement (now Serbin, Texas). Settlement Through their first winter they survived in little more than dug-outs and meager shelters. Through the coming year, they finished building their first church and a school, and continued to preserve their culture. Their pastor Johann Kilian persevered, preaching in both Sorbian and German as more German migrants moved closer. Eventually he added English to the list of his preaching languages. The use of German had made such inroads into the community that gravestones for Kilian and his family were carved in German. His sons continued the Wendish preaching and teaching, but with them ended the last of major Wendish language exposure to the small colony. Civil War-era The Wendish valued strong work ethic and having emigrated seeking liberty, did not feel it necessary to participate in slave ownership.https://www.rastko.rs/rastko-lu/istorija/texas.html Many Wendish homesteads continued to grow and develop profitable cotton crop during this time. As a result of high premiums on cotton from the a Union blockade of the Gulf and borders, the Wends smuggled cotton for sale on European Markets, evading federal troops and bandits and boosting the economy.https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/drw01 Several Wendish men can be traced to serving honorably in 1st Battalion Infantry, Waul's Texas Legion, having been recruited by a Captain Robert Voigt, Company C. The unit was eventually captured and sent to detainment by federal troops in 1863 at Yazoo City. Among C Company was a Wend, Johann Kieschnik, who while in custody was immediately sought out by his captors for his services as a shoemaker. Several Wendish men became seriously ill, and even died in federal captivity.https://wendishresearch.org/Hot_Projects_Topics/American%20Civil%20War/company_c_1st_batt/2018-4-18%20Company%20C%20Roster.pdf Texas Wends at the Domowina in Bautzen, June 1994 =Twentieth century= While expanding land and economic opportunities, enticed many to start new Wendish communities and churches throughout Texas, and gradually dispersed throughout the United States. This intensified following the second world war, with many Wendish families generations moving to cities across the world. During this time, Concordia University began studying and documenting the Texas Wends, and their journey, leading to a development of the Texas Wendish Heritage Museum near the original St. Paul Church, Cemetery, and Picnic Ground. This study began to bring the Wends back together, represented by a Wendish Festivalhttp://texaswendish.org/2019/06/12/31st-annual-wendish-fest started in 1988 and is still continuing. In the 1990s, the Wends began organizing trips to the Domowina and have sustained relations with the residing Wends of Lusatia. Present day The towns of Serbin, Warda, Giddings, and the surrounding areas are still composed largely of descendants of these original Lusatian pioneers; though without many Wendish speaking pastors, the culture largely exists today in the Texas Wendish Heritage Museum, which continues to publish a newsletter, hosts the annual Wendish Festival, organizes trips for Wends to visit the Domowina, and is open throughout the year with special events, in Serbin, celebrating the traditions and history of the Wends. With renewal of the sense of Wendish culture since the 1970s, the Texas Wendish Heritage Society preserves the history and culture of this group with their museum located in Serbin, Texas. The 3000+ artifacts, documents and original log buildings of Johann Killian and his congregation serve as the chief voice of this bygone era. A Wendish Fest occurs annually every fourth Sunday in September, since 1988 in order to celebrate Wendish culture, traditions, and background. The festival has grown to be a premiere celebration of Wendish culture, with attendants from all over the world gathering to share their stories, eat Wendish Noodles and streusel coffee cake, participate in cross-cut saw and other traditional competitions, and keep alive the way of life brought from Lusatia. They continue to decorate eggs in their cultural fashion and their egg noodles are never far from the table. The original church bell, having been brought from Lusatia and since replaced in the St. Paul Lutheran Church's bell tower now rests at Concordia University Texas, a university in Austin, founded by Texas Wends and affiliated with the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod.

Life Anna Charlotte Amalia was the only daughter of Johan Willem Friso of Nassau-Dietz (after 1702 Prince of Orange) and his wife, Landgravine Marie Louise of Hesse-Kassel. She grew up in Friesland and spoke West Frisian herself. After her marriage to Friedrich of Baden-Durlach in 1727 she moved to Durlach. During her pregnancies, Amalia tyrannized her servants, and because of the princess's many tantrums, rumors circulated at the court of Durlach that she was mentally ill. Friedrich died on 26 March 1732, shortly after the birth of their second child. As further evidence of her alleged mental illness, it was charged that she shed no tears at the sight of her husband's corpse. Her father-in-law, Margrave Karl III Wilhelm, did not want Amalia influencing the new crown prince Karl Friedrich; though mother and son continued to live in Karlsburg Castle in Durlach, Amalia lived the rest of her life in a separate apartment in the castle, shielded from the outside world. The education of her two sons, Karl Friedrich and Wilhelm Ludwig, was taken over by her mother-in-law, Magdalena Wilhelmine of Württemberg.

Fulham Irish GAA hold the unique status of being the only club in London to offer dual players Senior Football & Senior Hurling. It is a unique achievement for a Club that was established in 2006 & only formed a hurling team as recently as 2011. The Fulham Irish Hurling Team defeated Granuaille in the London Intermediate Championship Final in 2012 to gain promotion to the top tier of London Hurling. The team completed a remarkable journey for the Club by joining the Senior ranks of the London Hurling fraternity in only their 2nd year of existence. Managed by Dublin Man, Anthony Scullion, they won the London Intermediate Championship at the second time of asking. They had lost the final by the narrowest of margins in their first year in 2011. The Fulham Irish Footballers won the London Intermediate Championship in their first attempt in 2006 after the London County Board allowed them to enter a team in Intermediate Competitions. The team went on to win the British Provincial title in the same year. The Footballers progressed to win every domestic honour in London culminating with their first Senior Championship win on 16 October 2011. The Fulham Irish Ladies Team was established in 2008 and like the footballers has progressed rapidly through the ranks and now sits comfortably at the top table. The Ladies team won the London Junior Championship in 2010 & followed up with the Intermediate Championship in 2011. The Ladies team won no fewer than 4 domestic cups in 2011. Fulham Irish GAA Club has created a one stop shop for dual players wishing to play both Hurling & Football at Senior Level in London. It is the only Club that offers such an opportunity to players moving to the English Capital. Anyone wishing to join the Club in any capacity should visit the Club website on www.fulhamirish.org. History Fulham Irish GAA Club was formed in January 2006 by a group of young Irish people who were working in the city of London. The group wanted to give people a chance to play Gaelic Football in London without travelling to the far West or North of London to existing clubs. Fulham Irish are the current London Senior Football Champions. The club were granted permission by the London County Board to participate in the London Intermediate Football Championship but had to begin in the lowest division of the London league. The club first fielded a team in April 2006 in a league game which they won at Ruislip against North London Shamrocks. The club attracts many players due to its central location. In 2006 the club created history by winning the London Intermediate Championship and the British Championship in its first year. The initial Fulham Irish Committee was spearheaded by Liam Barry (County Limerick) Chairman, Michael Rice (County Kerry) Secretary and John Doyle (County Carlow) Treasurer. Ken McGrath (County Waterford) was the first club captain. By the beginning of the 2008 season Fulham Irish had progressed to the top level of all competitions in London. David Connolly (County Monaghan) became Captain in 2008 and led the club to their first Division 1 League Title together with the Tipperary Cup. The club suffered just one defeat in 2008, a 1-point loss in a replay of the semi-final of the senior Championship. Fulham Irish started a Ladies Team in 2008. The Ladies team progressed to the London Junior Championship Final in their first year and lost the final by 2 points to the long established Holloway Gaels. In 2009 they reached the Junior Championship Final but lost out to a stronger Kingdom Kerry Gaels side. 2010 was the year for the Ladies team as they had a clean sweep of all Junior trophies, winning the Junior Championship Final against Clonbony 3-16 to 0-2, the Junior League Final against Dulwich Harps 3-13 to 1-2, The Tom O Connor Cup, The Southwark Festival Cup and the Anne Dunning Memorial Cup. In 2011 they won the London Intermediate Championship, just 12 months after winning the Junior Championship. In 2011 it was agreed that the club would form a Hurling Team. In their first year, the team reached the London Intermediate Hurling Championship Final, losing narrowly to a strong Michael Cusack's side who had been beaten in the final the previous year. In their second year of existence the hurlers won the London Intermediate Hurling Championship, and were promoted to the senior grade. The club is currently one of the top clubs in London and has developed an underage structure along with developing its own GAA pitch in Fulham. Fulham Irish won no fewer than 8 Cups in 2011 including the London Senior Football Championship on 16 October 2011 at Ruislip beating Parnells 1-08 to 0-07. A tremendous achievement for a Club just over 5 years old. The Club progressed to play the Connacht Champions (St. Brigids Roscommon) in the All Ireland Club Quarter Final on 4 December 2011. Sean Maguire from Lavey in County Cavan captained Fulham Irish to its first Senior Championship. The winning team lined out as follows: Declan Traynor (Meath), Gary O'Hare (Down), Conor McClean (Down), Martin Conway (Derry), Aidan Savage (Antrim), Shane Mulligan (Monaghan), John Boyce (Galway), Lorcan Mulvey (Cavan), Paddy Walsh (Carlow), Stephen Molumby (Dublin), Harry Murphy (Mayo), Iomar Barrett (Galway), David Connolly (Monaghan), Sean Maguire (Cavan), John Ryan (Tipperary) Subs Used: Fearghal McVey (Derry), Noel Nicholson (Galway), Marty Hughes (Tyrone), Padhraig McKernan (Down), John Reilly (Mayo).

Except for St. Maurice's cult, veneration for Bessus enjoyed a wider popularity than those associated with other saints of the Theban Legion and remains popular today. According to tradition, Constantius survived the decimation of his legion and fled to valleys of Aosta and Cogne. He then dedicated himself to converting the people in this area to Christianity. Evidence for Bessus' existence is confused and uncertain: the name of Bessus is actually identified with two different, semi- legendary saints with the same name: one was a martyred bishop of Ivrea who lived in the eighth century, the other was a hermit with the same name who lived in an Alpine sanctuary near Campiglia in Cogne Valley. In addition, there are two feast days associated with Bessus that were celebrated at Ivrea: August 10 and December 1. The cult of Saint Bessus may actually represent the Christianization of the cult associated with the Egyptian god Bes, also invoked for fertility. Bessus and Bes, as Fabio Arduino points out, are both associated with an ostrich feather in their iconography. Numerous legends were connected with Bessus. A breviary dating from 1473 states that Bessus was martyred in the following manner: he was invited to a banquet by some Piedmontese who had stolen the cattle that was now being served as a meal. When Bessus discovered this, he denounced the cattle thieves. Angered, the thieves chased him and forced him to jump the cliffs of Monte Fautenio. Bessus survived but was then killed by the Roman legionnaires who had slaughtered the Theban Legion at Agaunum. The cliff preserves an imprint associated with the saint. According to local tradition, the sanctuary dedicated to the saint was constructed on the place of Bessus' martyrdom, which remains today a place of pilgrimage. A different version of the tale states that the saint hid himself in the Valley of Cogne before being killed by the Roman soldiers. In 1912, Robert Hertz, a French historian and anthropologist, collected at Cogne a different version of Saint Bessus' death, which was part of an oral tradition passed down from generation to generation. This version states that Bessus was not a soldier of the Theban Legion at all, but a local shepherd who was so pious that God rewarded him with a prosperous, fat, and healthy flock. Envious of his prosperity, some shepherds killed him by forcing him off a cliff. Veneration Photo of the traditional St Bessus procession that takes place every year in the Alps near Campiglia, Turin, Italy. According to a local tradition, Bessus' relics were stolen in the ninth century and taken to Ozegna, to the chapel now occupied by the sanctuary known as Beata Vergine del Convento e del Bosco. Subsequently, during the reign of Arduin of Italy, the relics were translated to the cathedral of Ivrea, where they were placed in a Roman sarcophagus. Today, the relics rest in a lateral altar along with those associated with other martyr saints. Saint Bessus was considered to be a great thaumaturgus and miracle-worker, and a protector of soldiers against the dangers of war; he was also invoked for fertility. On August 10 of every year, a festival and pilgrimage is held every year in the mountains of Gran Paradiso National Park (Parco Nazionale del Gran Paradiso), in the Val Soana. A statue of the saint is carried to the cliff that is associated with his martyrdom. The honor of carrying the saint was once a cause of dispute between the towns of Cogne and Campiglia. Each town had once been under the jurisdiction of separate dioceses, but in the 13th century, the two towns became part of the diocese of Ivrea. Sources * Robert Hertz, \\"San Besso.

A tract typically consists of about 10 to a few hundred such units. A multitude of genes, in various eukaryotic species (including humans), contain a number of repetitions of the nucleotide triplet CAG or CAA. When the gene is translated into a protein, each of these triplets gives rise to a glutamine unit, resulting in a polyglutamine tract. Different alleles of such a gene often have different numbers of triplets since the highly repetitive sequence is prone to contraction and expansion. Several inheritable neurodegenerative disorders, the polyglutamine diseases, occur if a mutation causes a polyglutamine tract in a specific gene to become too long. Important examples of polyglutamine diseases are spinocerebellar ataxia and Huntington's disease. Trinucleotide repeat expansion occurring in a parental germline cell can lead to children that are more affected or display an earlier onset and greater severity of the condition. Trinucleotide repeat expansion is considered to be a consequence of slipped strand mispairing either during DNA replication or DNA repair synthesis. It is believed that cells cannot properly dispose of proteins with overlong polyglutamine tracts, which over time leads to damage in nerve cells. The longer the polyglutamine tract, the earlier in life these diseases tend to appear.Laura Bonetta, Polyglutamine Diseases: A Devastating Genetic Stutter , Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Retrieved 30 December 2008. History Nucleotide sequences encoding a lengthy polyQ tract were first noted in the gene encoding the Notch receptor. Variation of the length of this Notch polyQ tract, as caused by triplet repeat instability, was later found to cause developmental defects. The significance of similarly expanded tracts in humans became evident when polyQ tracts were found to underlie Huntington's disease and several spinocerebellar ataxias. In general, several neurodegenerative disorders were found to involve nucleotide repeat expansions in protein coding sequences.

Brandon Shores consists of two Babcock & Wilcox coal-fired boilers and two General Electric steam turbines with a combined nominal generating capacity of 1370 MWe. Unit 1 went into operation in May 1984 and Unit 2 in May 1991. The station shares a site adjacent to the Patapsco River with the Herbert A. Wagner Generating Station. The Brandon Shores plant dominates the site with its exhaust and flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) system stacks. Coal delivery The Brandon Shores and Wagner Generating Stations consume approximately 4.8 million tons of coal annually. Coal for both stations is delivered by barge. Although there is a railroad spur into the site, it is unused and would require improvements to restore it to an operational state. Renovation In order to meet Maryland requirements for reductions of nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and mercury, the plant was substantially renovated between 2007 and 2010. A new twin FGD stack was built to replace the existing stacks, which have been capped and are inoperative. Flue gas from the boilers is routed through the emissions control system that sprays the exhaust with a limestone slurry and collects gypsum for use in wallboard and fly ash for use in concrete. The system uses treated municipal wastewater from the Anne Arundel County Cox Creek wastewater treatment plant as the source of water for making the limestone slurry. 2012 sale The plant was originally constructed by a predecessor company of Constellation Energy, which was later purchased by Exelon in 2012. On August 9, 2012, Exelon announced that it had reached an agreement, subject to regulatory approvals, for the sale of the Charles P. Crane, Brandon Shores, and Herbert A. Wagner Generating Stations to Raven Power Holdings LLC, a newly formed portfolio company of Riverstone Holdings LLC, for approximately $400 million. Exelon had committed to divest the plants as condition for regulatory approval of its merger with Constellation Energy to alleviate concerns regarding potential market power in the regional wholesale electricity market. The sale was completed on November 30, 2012. Dispatch of electricity The electrical output of Brandon Shores Generating Station is dispatched by the PJM Interconnection regional transmission organization.

In the United States, research in this field has been carried out for many years under the auspices of the National Association for Music Education (NAfME, formerly MENC). There are a number of books about music education research, and several journals are devoted to reports of research in this field. Types of research In A Guide to Research in Music Education, Phelps, Ferrara and Goolsby define research as the identification and isolation of a problem into a workable plan; the implementation of that plan to collect the data needed; and the synthesis, interpretation and presentation of the collected information into some format which readily can be made available to others. Research typically falls into one of four categories: experimental, descriptive, historical, or philosophical. =Experimental= Experimental research is used to determine what will be or to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between variables. An example of experimental research is a 2000 study by Prickett and Bridges. The purpose of the study was to determine if the basic song repertoire of vocal/choral music education majors is significantly better than instrumental music education majors. The study revealed no significant difference between the two groups, and that neither group had developed a strong repertoire of standard songs outside of the college music classroom. The impact of the study was the recommendation that professors preparing music education students for their future careers consider adding activities to music education courses that build a strong song repertoire. =Descriptive= Descriptive research is used to determine what is and is usually conducted for one of three purposes: #to obtain data on the current status of existing phenomena, such as conditions, practices, and situations #to establish relationships among several variables, using the data about the current status to investigate relationships that may provide greater insight into the current status #to determine developments, trends, or changes by describing variables as they develop over a period of time There are three broad categories of descriptive research: survey studies, relationship studies, and development studies. Survey studies A survey is a systematic method of collecting information on one or more variables. An example of a survey study is a 1998 study by Gillespie and Hamann. The purpose of the study was to gather descriptive information about orchestra programs that can be used as baseline data when considering the needs of school string programs. The findings indicated a continued enrollment increase in school orchestras in the 1990s although the number of orchestra teachers remained stable, and that larger schools are more likely to offer orchestra instruction. The impact of the study was the recommendation that school systems should provide larger, more adequate teaching facilities and that universities and string teachers should emphasize strategies for teaching larger string classes in their teacher preparation programs. Development studies Development studies collect information on existing situations, determine relationships, and examine changes in these variables over a period of time. Development studies include: #longitudinal studies, which are conducted over a period of time with data collected from the same sample at specific intervals during the study #trend studies, in which a population is sampled and subjects at the same level of development are tested #cohort studies, which measure an entire population at periodic intervals over a period of time =Historical= Historical research refers to the collection of data to record and interpret past events. Source materials used by the historical researcher are normally of two kinds, primary and secondary. A primary source is first-hand information, observed directly by the researcher. A secondary source is second-hand information, not original to the researcher. Through the process of external criticism, the researcher learns whether or not the object of scrutiny is authentic. Through the process of internal criticism, the researcher determines if the information contained in the object is credible. An example of historical research is a 1993 study by Gruhn. The purpose of the study was to determine if Lowell Mason's Manual of the Boston Academy of Music for the Instruction in the Elements of Vocal Music on the System of Pestalozzi is truly based on Pestalozzian principles. A detailed comparison of the Manual, a work by Pfeiffer and Nageli, and a work by Kubler revealed that the Pfeiffer and Nageli work is much closer to the ideas advocated by Pestalozzi than the Kubler work, and that Mason's Manual is little more than a translation of Kubler. =Philosophical= Philosophical research is used to examine the underlying principles in any field. An example of philosophical research is a 1999 article by Bennett Reimer published in The Music Educators Journal: \\"Facing the Risks of the Mozart Effect.\\" This article is a response to the practice of music educators who advocated music education because of its relationship to spatial task performance. A 1993 research report from the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, University of California, Irving by Rauscher, Shaw, and Ky is an example of the research literature that supported what became known as \\"the Mozart Effect.\\" Reimer rejects spatial task performance as justification for music education because, according to Reimer's aesthetic philosophy, music education should be justified by its merit as an art, not for extra-musical reasons. History of research in American music education In 1837 the Connecticut General Assembly voted to collect educational data. Questionnaires were sent to all Connecticut schools in 1838. Eight questions were about music instruction. This was probably the first attempt in the U.S. to collect data on music instruction on a wide-scale basis and perhaps the earliest example of research in music education. In 1918 the Educational Council was established by the Music Supervisors National Conference (later the Music Educators National Conference or MENC). The Educational Council published bulletins, mostly based on survey data and including recommendations for the profession. One such bulletin was The Present Status of Music Instruction in Colleges and High Schools 1919-1920. In 1923 the name of the organization was changed from Educational Council to the National Research Council of Music Education. The name changed again in 1932 to the Music Education Research Council. The Journal of Research in Music Education began publication in 1953 under the editorship of Allen Britton. At first many of the articles were based on historical and descriptive research, but in the early 1960s the journal began to shift to experimental research. The Society for Research in Music Education was established in 1960, and in 1963 the Journal of Research in Music Education became its official publication. The MENC Historical Center was established in 1965. In 1978, MENC founded several Special Research Interest Groups. Research publications Price and Chang (2000) provide an overview of the many diverse music education research journals including annotation and publication details for each source. While the Journal of Research in Music Education continues to be the dominant journal in the field, other journals include the Bulletin of the Council for Research in Music Education, The Missouri Journal of Research in Music Education, The Bulletin of Research, Contributions to Music Education, The Bulletin of Historical Research in Music Education, and Update: The Applications of Research in Music Education. Research on the impact of music education research journals includes investigations of initial citation speeds (Hancock, 2015) and accumulated citations (Hamann & Lucas, 1998). Handbook of Research on Music Teaching and Learning One of the dominant events in the field of music education research was the 1992 publication of the Handbook of Research on Music Teaching and Learning. Edited by Richard Colwell, the Handbook contains fifty-five chapters written by more than seventy scholars. Colwell edited a second volume in 2002, The New Handbook of Research on Music Teaching and Learning. To see the shift of emphasis that has taken place in music education research in recent years, one need only compare the contents of the 1992 volume and the 2002 volume. The inclusion of sections on \\"Conceptual Framework\\" and \\"Evaluation\\" in the 1992 volume is evidence of emphasis on standards and a set body of knowledge. The absence of similar sections in the 2002 volume is evidence of a shift toward a pragmatic philosophical and a constructivist teaching theory. The inclusion of a section on \\"related arts\\" in the 2002 volume recalls the research of the late 1960s and 1970s. References Broomhead, P. (2001).
