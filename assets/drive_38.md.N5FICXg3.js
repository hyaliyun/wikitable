Early life and education Smith grew up in Camberwell, in the inner east of Melbourne. Smith's father Colin Smith competed with the Australian rowing team at the 1974 World Rowing Championships in Lucerne. In Year 9, Smith moved to Rugby School in the UK and returned to Scotch College, Melbourne for Year 10, where Smith began competing in rowing. He attended the University of Melbourne and Ormond College where he undertook a Bachelor of Arts in history and politics. At university, he competed with Melbourne University Boat Club, representing the Victorian and Australian rowing teams. At the conclusion of his rowing career he returned to the University of Melbourne where he undertook a Masters of International Politics. As part of this degree he won a Hansard research fellowship to study at the London School of Economics.

That boat rowed to bronze medal at the 2004 World Rowing Championships in Banyoles, Spain. At the 2005 World Rowing Championships in Gifu, Japan he competed in the lightweight coxless four. He was made a Australian Institute of Sport Residential Scholar for 2006, based in Canberra. At the 2006 World Rowing Championships at Eton, Dorney he competed in the lightweight coxless pair and finished in fourth place. In the years he was most active, 2001-2006, the boat position he frequently took was bow seat who sets direction, while the stern sets the pace. He sustained a significant back injury in the lead up to the 2006 World Championships. Smith retired due to this injury. Career Following his sporting career, Smith looked at becoming a journalist, and began an internship with the Canberra Press Gallery. He had joined the Liberal Party in 2005, and realised that he was too partisan to ever report impartially: \\"I thought, no I can't do this because I'm barracking.\\" He took roles as a political adviser in Australia and United Kingdom. His first role was in 2006 as an electoral officer for Michael O'Brien who was then the Member for Malvern and the Shadow Minister for Gaming. In 2007, after completing a short course at LSE Smith worked as a researcher for the UK Shadow Home Secretary, David Davis. He returned to Australia in 2008 and briefly worked for Malcolm Turnbull when he was leader of the opposition. Smith also staffed for Veterans Affairs Minister Bruce Billson. A year after his election as a councilor for the City of Stonnington, Smith was elected as the youngest Mayor of Stonnington. His relationship with the state government was adversarial, particularly after Smith decided \\"to urge motorists to ignore clearways signs\\" which Victorian government had erected in his municipality. In 2012, following his time as mayor, Smith worked as a management consultant in strategy and operations with Deloitte and as senior consultant working with the CEO of PricewaterhouseCoopers.  Parliamentary career  Smith defeated Mary Wooldridge for Liberal preselection for the seat of Kew and won the seat in the. Going on to the 2014 Victorian state election. He became the youngest member of the parliamentary Liberal Party. He has held a number of positions in the Liberal Party's shadow cabinet and in the parliament. From December 2018, he was Shadow Minister for Planning and Heritage, for Local Government, for Housing, and for Population. At this time, Smith began raising his public profile with regular media appearances with Jon Faine on Radio Melbourne and on ABC TV show The Drum. He was also published in The Australian and Herald Sun. Following the revelation that the source of the virus was possibly a bat in a Wuhan wet market, some constituents in Kew began calling for a cull of bats near the Yarra River. Smith advocated for these people, but said \\"whether that's drastic action, like a cull, or simply moving the bats on, is a matter for authorities.\\" The concern was described as \\"ridiculous\\" by one expert. Smith was also briefly prominent in the media for his personal attacks on Premier, Daniel Andrews' response to the pandemic. Smith at various times called Andrews a \\"schmuck\\", \\"loser\\", \\"dictator\\", \\"chairman\\", \\"Lurch\\" and \\"looney\\" on Twitter and in other media, as well as staying he was a ‚Äúfriendless loser‚Äù. Smith was asked by the leader of the opposition, Michael O'Brien to tone down the attacks however, Smith showed no sign of relenting. This failed to assist his public image, with former ABC Melbourne broadcaster Jon Faine stating that the Victorian Liberals have \\"never been so irrelevent\\". To try and garner public support, Smith conducted a Twitter poll asking voters to choose between two derogatory names to be used for Premier Daniel Andrews; \\"Dictator Dan\\" or \\"Chairman Dan\\". The outbursts appeared to create tension within the Liberal party, including speculation that Smith was undermining Mr O'Brien ‚Äî which he denied. Even so, broadcaster Neil Mitchell said that Smith had \\"crossed a line\\" because he was challenging the authority of his leader. In June 2020, following Black Lives Matter demonstrations in Melbourne, Smith criticised the government for not banning the protest. In September 2020, during Victoria's second lockdown due to Covid-19, Smith created an online poll against the Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews over the restrictions. In the online poll, Smith asked respondents to react to a post demanding that Mr Andrews resign over his handling of the pandemic. All reactions were rigged to correspond to \\"yes\\". However, this backfired as many online users noticed that Smith forgot about the 'care' react. This lead to an avalanche of support towards the 'care' react, with 27,000 respondents, compared to 4,600 respondents of all the other options combined.

Singapore's current Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong, described Tang as a ‚Äúsharp, shrewd and a good negotiator‚Äù who ‚Äúenabled the EDB to attract leading MNCs (multinational corporations) and investors from around the world.‚Äù Prime Minister Lee credits Tang with devising the initial plans for a regional industrial estate in Singapore, now known as Jurong Town Corporation (JTC), but a serious economic recession forced the government to postpone construction. Lee added ‚ÄúAs it turned out, Mr. Tang was absolutely right about the strategic direction, but was ahead of his time. Our current efforts to transform Jurong into the Jurong Lake District, including regional offices and an integrated work-live-play environment, reflect many of his original ideas.‚Äù Prime Minister Lee highlighted Tang's vision to expand JTC's role from infrastructure developer to a catalyst for new industries. Lee cited Tang as being ‚Äúinstrumental‚Äù in establishing Singapore's first Science Park and developing the Southern Island into a petrochemical hub. The US Energy Information Administration‚Äôs (EIA) 2013 report identifies Singapore as one of Asia's energy and petrochemical hubs, and places it among the top three oil training and refining centers in the world, Mr. Tang helped establish Singapore's first Science Park Tang‚Äôs vision for the Republic‚Äôs Science Park was to develop a research center that would cater to special industries and companies that were in the forefront of promoting research and high technology industries. His goal was to bring Singapore into a new stage of industrial development. Tang also recognized the importance of reclaiming land to expand the island. Under his direction, JTC reclaimed 650 hectares of land that now houses Tuas Biomedical Park. Tang adopted Singapore as his home and became a naturalized citizen. Lee stated that Tang‚Äôs passion for Singapore was ‚Äúbeyond doubt, and that Singapore was lucky to have had Mr. Tang.‚Äù Awards and honors *In 1972, the Singapore Government awarded Mr. I-Fang Tang, the Distinguished Public Services Award. *In 1978, the American-Chinese Institute of Engineers, New York conferred their Distinguished Services Award. *In 1989, Tang was awarded Singapore Businessman of the Year. Death Tang died in September 26, 2013. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong sent a letter of condolence to Tang's wife.

Housed in the Palace of the Marqu√©s de Dos Aguas, it was founded on 7 February 1947, from the donation of Manuel Gonz√°lez Mart√≠'s ceramics collection. Seven years later, once the restoration of the palace was completed, the museum opened to the public on 18 June 1954. Building The palace, originally a Gothic building, was fully reshaped to Baroque in the mid-18th century, when Hipolito Rovira designed its fa√ßade, made by the Valencian sculptor Ignacio Vergara. Nowadays, as the result of several later remodelings, it combines mainly Rococo, Neoclassical and Oriental style. Declared a historical-artistic monument in 1941, the building was bought by state in 1949 to locate Gonzalez Mart√≠ ceramics collection. Since then, there have been numerous interventions, including infrastructure improvements and renovation of the museum spaces. The last restoration took place between 1990 and 1998, carried out by the architect Gin√©s S√°nchez Hevia. =Ground floor= Mostly dedicated to temporary exhibitions, in this floor is the remarkable \\"carriage patio\\" (named this way because it was the carriage house and the stables) and the main stairs. =First floor= The first floor spans the private rooms of the Marquis de Dos Aguas, decorated with stucco, wall and ceiling paintings made by artists such as Pl√°cido Frances y Pascual, Jos√© Felipe Parra and Jos√© Brel Guiralt in the 19th century. Marble floors are of different colors, with the initials \\"MD\\", corresponding at the Marquis de Dos Aguas. Outstanding rooms are The Ballroom, the Red Room, the Eastern Sitting Room (also known as the Porcelain Sitting Room), equipped with part of the original furniture. Furthermore, all rooms are ornamented with works of art, lamps, clocks, vases, etc.; reflecting the elegance and style of the time. =Second floor= Hall of ceramics from the 16th, 17th and 18th century (second floor) Divided in several rooms, this whole floor is entirely dedicated to the exhibition of the ceramics collection, including one adapted to reproduce a typical Valencian kitchen, designed by self-Manuel Gonz√°lez Mart√≠, with mosaics, friezes and decorative panels of the 18th and 19th centuries. The decoration of this space is complemented with popular contemporary ceramic pots and copper objects. Collections In 1969 the museum increased its collection with numerous pieces of furniture, clothing, paintings, etc., with special interest in Valencian tradition and local artists. =Clothing= The museum received many valuable donations of ancient costumes since its foundation. In the past, the pieces were presented on wood mannequins with accessories as umbrellas, hats, blankets or fans. As light and the dust accumulated on the costumes caused considerable deterioration over time, it was agreed to withdraw the permanent collection, publishing catalogues and planning temporary exhibitions to show some pieces to the public. Included in the fabrics collection there are a series of twelve decorative Coptic textiles fragments, highlighting a tabulae with fig leaves decoration, dated between 140-380 AD; a fabric with polychrome bands dated between 210-390 AD; a fragment with dark background and two- colored decoration (probably taken from geometric mosaics) dated between 250-420 AD; and other fragment divided in three ornamental strips with putti and ducks on the central part and riders contained by side scrolls in laterals. This collection was purchased in el Rastro in 1964 by Gonz√°lez Mart√≠. =Painting= thumb Ignacio Pinazo - Carnival evening in the \\"Alameda\\" (detail). Oil on canvas, 1889. Gonz√°lez Mart√≠ National Museum of Ceramics and Decorative Arts The museum contains paintings such as Jos√© Vicente Perez y Vela's Immaculate Conception (1860); San Vicente Martir, an anonymous acquired in 1917, dated from the early 17th century and defrocked from the Cistercian monastery of Santa Mar√≠a de Benifass√†; and several works from Ignacio Pinazo, a Valencian 19th century painter. Another important quantity of paintings arrived at the museum because of the intervention of its founder, through the Commission for the Protection and Salvage of Valencian Artistic Treasures, in charge of protecting art objects at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. Among these works there are two oil on panel depicting St. Francis of Assisi and St. Vincent Ferrer, probably tabernacle doors and attributed to Nicol√°s Borr√°s (Joan de Joanes disciple). While most paintings are religious, there are also portraits and landscapes such as Rural landscape at sunset and a View of a harbor at dawn, under the influence of Dutch painting. Other pieces come from private donations or from the artists themselves, most of the 19th and 20th centuries. It is worth mentioning Ricardo Verde Rubio, Jos√© Benlliure or Ignasi Pinazo i Camarlench. =Ceramics= Medieval bowl from Paterna (14th century). Gonz√°lez Mart√≠ National Museum of Ceramics and Decorative Arts. The museum collection comprises from antique pottery: Greek, Iberian and Roman to modernism piece. The first collection donated by founder Gonz√°lez Mart√≠, consisted of about 6.000 items, mostly ceramics from the medieval period (including ceramic objects from Manises and Paterna and Hispano-Moresque ware) to popular 19th- century Valencian tiles. Hispano-Moresque ware is well represented by 13th and 14th centuries pieces decorated in green and manganese, lusterware, or other with white stanniferous enamel or cobalt blue luster. These types of Muslim ceramics gave way to the technical basics of 15th century Spanish pottery and Christian production. The Gonzalez Mart√≠ collection shows works from different places, mainly Italian and Spanish productions. There are medieval architectonical pieces from diverse Valencian palaces and headquarters, such heraldic shields or floor tiles (orders made by aristocracy or institutions) and socarrats, destined to interior ceilings, terraces friezes, stairs or other places. Local pieces are exhibited with other contemporary of Spanish and Italian production. 17th-century Florentine tondo depicting Madonna and Child, attributed to the manufacture of Benedetto Buglioni‚Äôs workshop. At the time of the Renaissance, Florence was a producer of polychrome glazed ceramic, which arrived to Spain through the continental trade. One example of this type of ceramic is a 17th-century Florentine tondo depicting Madonna and Child, attributed to the manufacture of Benedetto Buglioni‚Äôs workshop. In the collection there are several pieces from the Royal Factory of Alcora, whose ceramic and porcelain works influenced Valencian centers, especially Manises, that introduced polychrome pieces. Since 2012 the museum owns an 18th-century Neapolitan nativity scene that consists of 29 figures ranging between 10 and 40 cm, made with wire body, wooden limbs and terracotta head, dressed with fine period clothes and decked with rich accessories. Between the latest showed objects, there are Modernist works of the Valencian sculptor Benlliure and some ceramic pieces of the 20th century donated by Pablo Picasso. =Other collections= Displayed in the Carriage patio are the Nymphs' coach designed by Hip√≥lito Rovira and Ignacio Vergara in 1753; an Empire style carriage, owned by the Marquis de Llanera; and a Rococo sedan chair, also of the 18th century.

Its purpose was to influence Lao peasantry to vote during May National Assembly elections for those politicians the U.S. favored. Because of the lack of roads in Laos, Booster Shot became an air delivery operation. It proceeded somewhat haphazardly due to rushed planning. Although logistically successful, the end result was electoral victory by the communist candidates opposed to the U.S. Subsequently, right wing Assembly members organized against the newly elected communists. Also, the Programs Evaluation Office in the American embassy gained an aerial delivery section; this was the beginning of extensive air operations in Laos.  Background  As the First Indochina War ended in French defeat, the 1954 Geneva Conference agreed on neutrality for the newly independent Kingdom of Laos. In January 1955, a United States Operations Mission was established in the American embassy in Vientiane. It spent $1.4 million on such civic action projects as schools, administrative training, farming, and public health, and about four times that in military aid.Castle, pp. 11‚Äì12, 15‚Äì16, 34‚Äì35.  The rural aid campaign  As a result of the Geneva Conference, elections were held in Laos in December 1955. Although closed out of the two northeastern Pathet Lao-occupied provinces, votes were cast in the other ten provinces of Laos. However, no clear majority emerged from the election. Those in power remained until a follow-up election could be held.Anthony, Sexton, p. 15. In preparation to new elections due on 24 April 1960, the Royal Lao Government sent 5,000 troops electioneering on Operation Cleansweep through Military Region 4 for six weeks prior to the election.Conboy, Morrison, p. 26. American Ambassador to Laos J. Graham Parsons was faced with the prospect of Pathet Lao communists running legally in the elections provided for by the Geneva Conference. Maintaining discipline, the leftists proposed a single candidate for each office. On the other side of the political spectrum, by February the rightists were running 85 candidates for the same 21 seats.Jacobs, p. 78. The United States had pumped $202 million in foreign aid into Laos since 1955. The Pathet Lao were electioneering on a platform of peace, national unity, and a cleanup of corruption. Prince Phetsarath Ratanavongsa blamed Americans for inflation of the Lao kip, as well as causing governmental fraud. Worried that the non-communists who were favored by America were going to do poorly, Parsons began a crash rural aid program; he named it Booster Shot. Programs were selected to give \\"immediate and tangible political benefits\\" to those Lao politicians the U.S. favored. Central Intelligence Agency officer Rufus C. Phillips was placed in charge. He hired ten man teams to carry out Booster Shot. Each team had two specialists in each of five fields‚Äîfarming, schools, public works, health, and information. In contrast to the usual low-key approach that allowed credit for the aid to redound to host government, Booster Shot was high profile.Rust, pp. 82‚Äì85. While the State Department had envisioned air drops from unmarked aircraft, newly arrived ambassador Horace H. Smith took charge and not only insisted on using obviously American aircraft, but on affixing U.S. symbols on the aid packages. Bulldozers were parachuted with both American and Lao flags streaming from them. Smith wanted the U.S. help to be evident to the Lao populace.Rust, pp. 87‚Äì90. The roads in Laos were scanty and abysmal, leaving aircraft as the alternative.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 5, 15. The Royal Lao Air Force being incapable of air delivery of the civic action supplies, another carrier had to be found. The U.S. 483rd Troop Carrier Wing of C-119 Flying Boxcars was forwarded from Ashiya Air Base, Japan. The C-119s were augmented by two new C-130 Hercules detailed to the specific task of air-dropping a pair of bulldozers. The wing was tasked to airlift 37 tons (33.6 metric tons) of freight from Bangkok to Laos, and with airdropping 23 tons (20.9 metric tons) of supplies.Anthony, Sexton, p. 16. The airlift mission arrived on station on 31 March 1958. In four days, they finished their assignment. Then, before they could depart, they found themselves charged with another phase of Booster Shot. This had its difficulties. Although prepared for their initial task, the 483rd was unready for operations beyond that. Some of their aircraft were coming due for maintenance; two were scheduled for immediate care in Japan after returning from the planned week's exercise. Additionally, the second phase cargo lists were still being gathered from disparate U.S. agencies in Laos. Obsolete maps caused problems locating drop zones.Anthony, Sexton, p. 17. On 4 April, the 483rd contingent moved to Vientiane, Laos, in an effort to conserve flying hours on the C-119s. To disguise the fact they were U.S. Air Force members illicitly in country, the airmen donned civilian clothing. Military ranks were dropped as a salutation; thus began a custom that lasted as long as the Air Force was secretly involved in Laos. Two of the three C-119s flew their last allowable hours the following day, and left for Japan for maintenance. Phase two of Booster Shot would continue with a scratch lot of scrounged craft, including C-124 Globemasters. Air America flew 72 sorties.Prados, p. 95. However, the flights were a logistic success. They moved 1,135 tons (1,030 metric tons) of materiel and airdropped 300 tons (272 metric tons) into 50 rural sites.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 17‚Äì18. Over 90 projects had been supplied when the air drops ended 27 April 1958. Work on the projects would continue through the election, ending 23 May.  Results  While Ambassador Smith predicted the leftists would win only three or four seats,Jacobs, pp. 79‚Äì80. communist propaganda took credit for the Booster Shot air drops. It was claimed that heavy equipment and supplies dropped in northern Laos were actually aid from the Chinese communist neighbors.Rust, p. 90. The Pathet Lao also claimed that the air drops were a short-lived attempt to buy votes. Given the Lao government's treatment of the peasantry, that was a compelling argument.Anthony, Sexton, p. 19. One missive read: In the event, there were miscues, such as parachuting leather shoes into trackless areas that spent months muddied by the rainy season. The airlift may have been considered a success, despite its difficulties. However, the election results seemed disastrous. With 21 National Assembly seats up for grabs, the Pathet Lao won nine and their fellow leftist allies four more. Although eight of their members were already seated, numbers still did not quite favor them in the 59-seat Assembly.Askew et al, p. 132. In reaction, entrenched right wing politicians formed the Comite pour la Defense des Interets Nationaux to counter the communists. The new committee worked closely with the new Prime Minister, Phoui Sananikone.Conboy, Morrison, p. 18.Anthony, Sexton, p. 19. In June 1958, Ambassador Smith reported to the State Department that Booster Shot \\"has had a greater impact on Laos than any other aid program which the United States has undertaken in this area to date\\".Goldstein, p. 195. The efficacy of aerial resupply operations in Laos having been proven, a six-man support section was set up in the embassy's Programs Evaluation Office on 16 October 1958 to manage further airlifts.Anthony, Sexton, p. 18. Souvanna Phouma pointed out to the Americans that the election results weren't so unfavorable after all. He also declared that the election finally satisfied the provisions of the 1954 Geneva Conference.Jacobs, pp. 80‚Äì81.  Notes   References  * Anthony, Victor B. and Richard R. Sexton (1993).

Huffman (born November 14, 1964) is a Republican member of the Ohio Senate, representing the 5th district since 2019. Previously, Huffman served two terms in the Ohio House of Representatives.  Life and career  Huffman is a lifelong resident of Miami County and was raised in Ludlow Falls, Ohio. He graduated from the University of Toledo and has been a practicing physician for nearly 20 years. In 2013, Huffman announced that he was running for the Ohio House of Representatives after the incumbent, Richard Adams, announced he was not seeking another term. Huffman won a three-way primary with 45% of the vote, and won the general election to take the seat with 77% of the vote.  Ohio Senate  In 2018, state Senator Bill Beagle was term-limited, leaving the 5th district an open seat for that year's election. As a result, Huffman opted to forego another term in the Ohio House to run for the Senate seat. A competitive seat, the 5th district was a Democratic stronghold until it was won by Beagle in 2010. Despite this, Huffman prevailed, winning over Democrat Paul Bradley, 53% to 47%. Huffman was sworn in for his first term on January 1, 2019.  Controversies  In December 2019, The Washington Post detailed how an editorial in the Sidney Daily News against Medicare for all by Huffman was drafted with the help of lobbyist Kathleen DeLand of the pharmaceutical, hospital, and healthcare insurance lobbying group, Partnership for America's Health Care Future. Two Montana state lawmakers, Rep. Kathy Kelker and Sen. Jen Gross, were also implicated. In a June 9, 2020 hearing on whether to declare racism a public health crisis in Ohio, Huffman asked if it were possible blacks were contracting coronavirus at higher rates because \\"the colored population do not wash their hands as well as other groups\\". Ohio Legislative Black Caucus President Stephanie Howse said, \\"The fact that a well-educated legislator ‚Äì a Vice Chair of the Health Committee and a practicing medical doctor ‚Äì would, in a public setting, nonchalantly use such antiquated terminology paired with a hurtful, racist stereotype all in one breath reflects how unconscious this problem of racism is for too many.\\" Huffman later apologized.

The Whites attend the 3C Cowboy Church in Salado in southern Bell County. Political activism White is strongly opposed to abortion. She founded the non-profit organization Women for Life International and is the legislative director for Operation Outcry. As a young woman, White had two abortions. She became opposed to abortion in 1992 while attending a Bible study and has since spoken out about how abortion has negatively impacted her life. She criticises the national media for not reporting on post-abortion trauma as she personally experienced. White annually lobbies before the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women in an attempt to push the organization into a conservative direction. Prior to her legislative service, she worked for passage of parental-consent laws impacting under-age women who procure an abortion and for the defunding of the abortion provider Planned Parenthood. She has lobbied for mandatory medical ultrasonography screening before a woman can receive an abortion. She has also worked with Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum, Texas Right to Life, Concerned Women for America, and the Liberty Institute.

History John Danks (January 1828 ‚Äì 28 February 1902) was born in Wednesbury, Staffordshire, England. He served an apprenticeship with his father, also named John Danks, a manufacturer of wrought iron tubing, then joined his brothers Samuel and Thomas, who were setting up a similar factory. In 1857 the brothers emigrated to Melbourne in the Shaftesbury, and started manufacturing iron pipes and plumbing fittings; one of their first major contracts was to manufacture connectors for Melbourne's pioneering Yan Yean Reservoir.J. Ann Hone, 'Danks, John (1828‚Äì1902)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published first in hardcopy 1972, accessed online 6 December 2014 Thomas and Samuel Danks retired from business in 1860 and 1871 respectively; under John's management the company steadily grew; he brought in as a partner his son Aaron Turner Danks, who made a speciality of brass casting, and opened a subsidiary business in Staffordshire. The payroll grew from 35 to 150, aided by import tariffs of from 12¬Ω% to 20%. The business was hard hit by the Depression of the 1890s, but they opened a factory in Sydney, and won a major contract associated with expansion of the Melbourne sewerage network; by 1900 the payroll had reached 200. Aaron followed his father as managing director of John Danks & Son in 1902. They cast and installed the eight bells of St Bartholomew's Church, Burnley 1927‚Äì1929. In the Depression years of the 1930s, the company's manufacturing business shrank, and its fortunes depended on retail trade from its stores at 391 Bourke Street, Melbourne, and elsewhere. John Danks & Son was floated as a public company in 1950. In 1970 John Danks Holdings Ltd. became part of an Australia-wide chain of hardware retailers Australian Hardware Distributors Pty.

Mediacracy is closely related to a theory on the role of media in the United States political system, that argues that media and news outlets have a large level of influence over voting citizens' evaluations of candidates and political issues, thereby possessing effective control over politics in the United States. Background The term \\"mediacracy\\" was first coined in 1974 by writer and political commentator Kevin Phillips, who used the term in the title of his book Mediacracy: American Parties and Politics in the Communications Age. Since then, the concept has gained popularity and is used by political scientists and researchers alike to discuss the impact of media on both voting behavior and cultural trends. Most recently, the term has seen a resurgence due to the works of economist and author Fabian Tassano. In his book Mediocracy: Inversions and Deceptions in an Egalitarian Culture Tassano argues that the 'dumbing down' of popular media when coupled with increasing obscurity in scholarly discourse leads to a society which has the appearance of egalitarianism, but ultimately is a society ruled by elites. As a reflection of this, the term mediacracy is usually accompanied by negative assumptions about the true nature of media in the United States, along with the aims and desires of mass media as a whole. Potential causes There are three main potential causes for the rise in the media's influence on elections, being a combination of different theories on the cultural influence of mass media and recent populist democratic reforms in the American political system. Supporters of the mediacracy theory argue that when taken together, these causes greatly show that the media have a large level of influence over politics in the United States, drawing a link between media's leverage on public opinion, and the increased power that public opinion has on who is elected to office. These potential causes include, but are not limited to: =Agenda setting= Agenda-setting refers to the ability of the media to affect the salience of issues on the public agenda. In short, the amount of attention paid to a certain issue will lead to audiences viewing that issue as more important. The theory of agenda-setting was formally developed by Dr. Max McCombs and Dr. Donald Shaw in their study on the 1968 presidential election conducted at Chapel Hill, North Carolina. McCombs and Shaw polled 100 residents of the Chapel Hill community and found a strong correlation between what those residents believed to be the most important election issue, and what local and national media outlets reported as the most important election issue. This was a landmark study that displayed a link between an issue's salience in media content and the corresponding salience of that issue in voter's minds. As of 2005, over 400 studies have discussed the presence of agenda-setting, and the issue remains relevant to the study of the American political system. =Priming= Priming, in a political context is a theory stating that the media draws attention to some issues as opposed to others, thereby altering the standards by which we judge candidates in elections. Priming is often used in concert with agenda setting in the media, and the two concepts taken together contribute to a full understanding of the level of influence that the mass media holds over the voting public. This theory on media originated from researchers Iyengar, Peters, and Kinder in their work Experimental Demonstrations of the \\"Not-So-Minimal\\" Consequences of Television News Programs published in the 1982 edition of The American Political Science Review. Iyengar, Peters, and Kinder argue that due to media making certain issues more salient than others, they set the parameters of the political decisions made by the voting public. While priming is often unintentional, Iyengar, Peters, and Kinder's 1982 study examines how intentional priming can shape the public's evaluations of candidates and elected officials. The researchers looked at how the salience of certain topics affected voters' evaluations of President Jimmy Carter, and found evidence to support the presence of both agenda setting and priming. Iyengar et al. first proved the effects of agenda setting by finding a correlation between the attention paid to certain political topics and those topics' importance with the voting public when evaluating the President. The researchers then found evidence of priming by finding a link between those established standards, and voters' resulting evaluations of President Carter. Supporters of the mediacracy theory largely point to this joint phenomenon as evidence that the mass media holds a large amount of control over the voting population. =Populist reforms in American democracy= Over the course of the last half century, there have been a number of reforms that have led to a shift in control over candidate selection from party elites to the voting public. Thomas Patterson examines this shift, and its resulting correlation with rising political influence of the mass media, in his book Out of Order. From 1960 to 1980, the number of bound or committed delegates in both parties more than doubled, going from 20% on the Democratic side and 35% on the Republican side to 71% and 69% for each respectively in 1980. Also, from 1960 to 2004, the number of states holding primary contests (which favor party eliteshttps://www.dailykos.com/stories/2020/1/26/1914280/-With-10-of-18-Caucus- States-Switching-To-Primaries-In-2020-Which-Candidate-Would-Benefit) instead of caucuses (which favor populism) has more than doubled. Patterson argues that this shift has indirectly strengthened the power of media outlets that have been shown to have much influence over citizens' evaluations of candidates, and as such the media holds much sway in the American political system, despite relatively low levels of political accountability. Potential effects Most researchers who discuss the theory of mediacracy agree that media control of the American political system would lead to a decline in objective, rational information sharing in politics at best, and a society that is controlled by the owners of large media conglomerates at worst. However, it is important to remember that the theory of mediacracy as it is popularly discussed is accompanied by very negative assumptions about the true nature of media in the United States, which affects the predilections that researchers make about the future. Paul Kurtz argues that current media trends emphasizing sensationalization tend to appeal to the lowest common denominator, which would contribute to a decline in the level of education and reflective cognitive thought of media consumers. Kurtz also argues that growing media consolidation harms diversity of opinion in society, and that the focus of media conglomerates on maximizing profits will lead to advertiser control over information obtained through media outlets. This sentiment is greatly echoed by Fabian Tassano, who goes on to speculate that eventually a privileged elite of informed citizens will have control over society. Controversies The primary complaint against the theory of mediacracy is that researchers who support the theory are vastly overstating the effects of media influence. Sharon Meraz argues in her study The fight for 'how to think': Traditional media, social networks, and issue interpretation that due to rising fragmentation in information control during the age of the internet, there is \\"weakening influence of elite, traditional media as a singular power in influencing issue interpretation within networked political environments.\\". In her study Meraz effectively shows that emerging technologies have reduced the power of media elites, leading to a decline in the hegemonic level of control central to the theories of most supporters of the mediacracy theory. Whether this is a permanent change, or a temporary result of new technology that will be eventually co-opted by media elites, is yet to be determined.

Already a seasoned veteran of several wars, he was a senior military commander of the Russo-Turkish War of 1768‚Äì1774, where his forces occupied the Crimean Khanate, from which he derived his honorary title of \\"Krymsky\\". He was the original builder and owner of the House of the Unions and numerous other historic mansions that dot the city of Moscow. Biography Vasily Mikhailovich was the son of senator and governor of Siberia Prince Mikhail Vladimirovich Dolgorukov from his marriage to Princess Yevdokiya Yurievna Odoyevskaya. His childhood was marked by the disgrace and imprisonment of his uncle Vasily Vladimirovich Dolgorukov under the reign of Empress Anna Ioannovna, which affected the entire family. Vasily Mikhailovich was inducted into the military as a private in 1735 at the age of 13, where he gained his first combat experience fighting under Field Marshal Burkhard Christoph von M√ºnnich in the Crimea. He would distinguish himself at the Siege of Perekop. Before the storming of the fortress, M√ºnnich promised that the first soldier to ascend the fortifications alive would be promoted to officer. Young Dolgorukov would prove to be that soldier, and was given the rank of poruchik. When Anna had ascended the throne, she had ordered that no one from the Dolgorukov family be granted officer rank in the military, that they could only be allowed in the enlisted ranks. According to research by Valentin Pikul, M√ºnnich reported the events of the siege to the Empress in person, including his act of promoting Vasily. Anna simply replied to her general, \\"Do not take away my sword from this suckling\\", and so Vasily Mikhailovich became the only member of his entire noble clan to be exempted from the ban during her ten-year reign.Valentin Pikul –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –º–∏–Ω–∏–∞—Ç—é—Ä—ã. –í –¥–≤—É—Ö —Ç–æ–º–∞—Ö. , , –ì–ª–∞–≤–∞ ¬´–°–æ–ª–¥–∞—Ç –í–∞—Å–∏–ª–∏–π –ú–∏—Ö–∞–π–ª–æ–≤¬ª Under the rule of Elizabeth Petrovna, Dolgorukov would find himself promoted rapidly through the ranks. In 1741 he would be made a captain, and by 1745 would be a lieutenant-colonel and adjutant to his now rehabilitated uncle Vasily Vladamirovich, who had been appointed president of the Collegium of War, the body that oversaw the entire Imperial Army. In 1747 he was made a full colonel and given command over his own regiment, the Tobolsk Infantry. According to the recollections of Prince Yakov Shakhovskoy, which he cited from his personal notes,http://imwerden.de/pdf/zapiski_kn_yakova_petrovicha_shahovskogo_1821.pdf Dolgorukov conspicuously studied from his fellow commanders to improve his knowledge of military affairs. Seven Years' War Dolgorukov, now a major- general, served in the Seven Years' War, distinguishing himself at both the Siege of K√ºstrin and the subsequent Battle of Zorndorf in August 1758. For the valor he demonstrated at K√ºstrin, he would later be promoted to lieutenant- general and awarded the Order of Alexander Nevsky. Towards the end of this campaign Dolgorukov was wounded in the leg by canister shot, and had to seek treatment for his injury, but the General recovered in time to lead an infantry brigade at the Kunersdorf. He was also present at the Third Siege of Kolberg as one of Rumyanstev's subordinates. When Catherine the Great took power towards the end of the war, she made a point of favoring Dolgorukov for his service, having him promoted to general-in-chief on the day of her formal coronation. In 1767 she would award him the Order of St. Andrew, the highest order of knighthood in the Russian Empire. Russo-Turkish War of 1768‚Äì1774 In 1769 Prince Dolgorukov was assigned the mission to cordon off the border between the Russia and the Crimean Khanate with his detachment of troops. The next year he succeeded Petr Ivanovich Panin as commander of the 2nd Field Army.

His story was the first memoir written by a transsexual person in Sweden and is regarded as unique in many aspects.Inger Littberger Caisou-Rousseau: Therese Andreas Bruce : en s√§llsam historia fr√•n 1800-talet. Levnadsber√§ttelse (2013) Early life He was born to the nobleman and courtier Adam Bruce and Fredrica Charlotta Wijnblad. During his upbringing, he regarded himself as male, and wrestled with his brother with the approval of the father, and was generally referred to as \\"Little Miss Master\\". As he reached adulthood, however, the family demanded he behave as a female. At the age of sixteen, he made an attempt to run away from home dressed as a male. After this, his father took him to be examined by a physician, Anders Johan Hagstr√∂mer, professor in anatomy and surgery in Stockholm. He went to the examination after the brother, with the father's permission, had dressed him as a male, and told to physician: \\"If I can not live in trousers, then I can not live at all\\". Gender transition In July 1825, the physician issued a statement were Bruce was declared to be a \\"hermaphrodite\\" (intersex) whose male genitals were more developed than the female. After this statement was read, his father took him to a public house, celebrated with a drink, called him his new son, gave him the name Ferdinand Andreas Edvard Bruce and asked him to make sure not to shame the family name. He allowed him to use male dress and live publicly as a man. He also took a seat in the male section of the church with his father and brother, an incident which made a lady in church to faint. He also visited the capital of Stockholm as a man, drank alcohol and smoked in public, which was then only acceptable for males. However, his sex change was seen as a scandal by society and was reported in the press. This caused his family to disown him for having scandalized the family name, and he made peace with them only after having promised, dictated by a priest, to live a discreet private life outside Stockholm. In 1829 he moved to the island of Gotland, and took a job as a male clerk in the company of the ship owner Jacob Dubbe in Follingbo on Gotland. Dubbe was known to be so strict that few would work for him, but Bruce took it as a challenge to prove his male courage. Bruce also took part in the drills in the local militia, and regarding it as a way to prove his masculinity, he made such efforts that he received praise from his commanders. Apparently, it was actually known that Bruce was biologically female, but this was accepted and not openly spoken of. However, the military doctor disliked Bruce and, according to Bruce, banned him from the army for personal reasons. Bruce normally only associated sexually with women. In July 1838, however, Bruce gave birth to a daughter, who he named Carolina. The father of the child was the inspector Lars Nystr√∂m. Bruce did not state whether the intercourse was a rape or not, only that he had not been careful. According to Bruce, Nystr√∂m had known he was biologically female and courted him, and after having become drunk together, Bruce had allowed Nystr√∂m to stay the night. After being pregnant, Nystr√∂m abandoned Bruce, who contemplated suicide. According to Bruce, he endured the pains of the birth according to the way a man was expected to ignore pain. After the delivery, Bruce moved from town to √ñja with his daughter, his mistress Maria Lindblad and her daughter, and raised his daughter as her father. He was not allowed to marry Lindblad, and after it became known that he was the biological mother of his illegitimate daughter Carolina, he was denied the Churching of women, which prevented him from attending church for a period of ten years, a social stigma of the time. Legacy Bruce wrote his own biography, partially in letters to his daughter Carolina between 1859 and 1881. It is regarded as unique as a biography from a transsexual in the 19th century in Sweden. Bruce is also known within scientific historical research. Bruce has been pointed out as the role model for the character Tintomara in the novel Drottningens juvelsmycke by Carl Jonas Love Almqvist.

In 1539 townships were grouped together in Hundreds.‚ÄùChapman‚Äù (1999), 48-9‚ÄùChapman‚Äù (2012), 48-9 The Townships which were recognised were based on the older Welsh divisions of Tref, or plural Trefi, which had formed the Welsh administrative districts of the Commote. Not all of the former Tref were recognised and some smaller trefi were amalgamated into larger townships. A township was allocated to a particular parish, but townships were recognised as administrative districts, rather than the parishes. Townships in Montgomeryshire The Townships have been mapped by Murray Chapman.(Chapman M) Map of Montgomeryshire and Western Shropshire showing Townships, Printed map published by the Powysland Club, c1990 The Townships were grouped into Hundreds, and this formed the basis for the Montgomeryshire Court of Great Sessions. The Court met for the first time in 1541, and established the civil and criminal administration of the new County of Montgomeryshire and also arranged for the election of the Member of Parliament for Montgomeryshire. A Mr Sulyard was appointed as surveyor to define the new counties and presumably agree the new townships.\\"Chapman\\", 2010, 138. The number of Trefi were reduced and many were grouped together. An example is the township named Trefor and Ffin in Kerry. In the large township of Rhandir in Llandyssil parish, the trefi of Coed-wig, Trefganol and Cefn-y-coed were all merged. Many names of Trefi were lost, but some are noted in Melville Richards study of administrative units.\\"Richards\\", 1969 The exact extent of many townships can be recovered from many of the Enclosure Awards, but for some Montgomeryshire parishes such as Llangynog the information appears to be missing. Townships have been studied in Wales and the Marches by Dorothy Sylvester. She has shown that in Montgomeryshire and North West Wales Parishes were normally larger in the Medieval period and would contain many townships, while in Southern and Western Wales, parishes would be smaller and often the extent of the Township will coincide with that of the parish.Sylvester D., (1969), The Rural Landscape of the Welsh Borderland: A Study in Historical Geography, Macmillan, London pp 166-175, fig 22. Sylvester notes that in 1811 there were 53 parishes in Montgomeryshire, with an average size of 15.8 square miles, making them larger than most parishes in other Welsh counties. There were about 239 townships, with an average of 4.5 per parish.\\"Sylvester\\", pg. 168, Table VII Some Montgomeryshire township were within ecclesiastical parishes which were outside County. This is particularly the case along the Montgomeryshire Shroshire border and Sylvester‚Äôs figures may have to be modified. The pattern of local government for Montgomeryshire based on the Township, Hundred and the Court of Great Sessions survived until 1830, when the Court of Great Sessions was abolished\\"Chapman\\", (2010), 141 while the Assises and Quarter Sessions remained. The responsibilities of Townships further declined with the establishment of the Poor Law Unions in 1834, which were organised on a parish basis. Townships in Montgomeryshire finally disappeared as a recognised administrative unit with the establishment of the Montgomeryshire County Council in 1886 and the Rural District Councils in 1894.Morris E R in ‚ÄúJenkins‚Äô‚Äô, pp. 65-6 Administration of Townships As the pattern of administration evolved in Elizabethan and later times, the Welsh Township was expected to have its own Court House (sometimes called a Plas), and to provide a pinfold, stocks and butts for archery. They were also responsible for Vagabonds and Paupers. Two Parish Constables were appointed each year for the administration of Justice. The maintenance of roads and bridges was also a responsibility of the Township,http://welshjournals.llgc.org.uk/browse/viewpage/llgc- id:1264487/llgc-id:1269036/llgc-id:1269088/getText but this was reduced in 1819, when Thomas Penson was appointed as the first County Surveyor for Montgomeryshire. The Militia in the earlier period would be raised by the Hundred with the townships contributing. The Court House would normally be the main residence in the Township and the occupier of the house was likely to be a Justice of the Peace. With the establishment of the National Census in 1801, the population counts were on a township rather than parish basis. Hundreds in Montgomeryshire  Montgomeryshire was initially split into 10 Hundreds, but Clun Hundred was removed by an Act of Parliament in 1546 and included in Shropshire.

It involves the care of undifferentiated, unscheduled children with acute illnesses or injuries that require immediate medical attention. While not usually providing long-term or continuing care, pediatric emergency doctors undertake the necessary investigations and interventions to diagnose patients in the acute phase, to liaise with physicians from other specialities, and to resuscitate and stabilize children who are seriously ill or injured. Pediatric emergency physicians generally practice in hospital emergency departments. Training =United States of America= Pediatric emergency physicians in the United States take one of two routes of training; one can do a pediatrics residency (3 years) followed by a pediatric emergency fellowship (3 years), or an emergency medicine residency (3-4 years) followed by a pediatric emergency fellowship (3 years). Majority of practicing PEM doctors take the former route. There are currently 50+ PEM fellowship programs with 177 total spots in the United States. A survey published in 2009 found that PEM physicians report higher career satisfaction than doctors in all other specialties. Per doximity, pediatric emergency physicians in the U.S. make an average of $273,683 yearly. They also work fewer hours than do other subspecialists. =Canada= In Canada, aspiring paediatric emergency physicians must first complete a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) and then apply to a paediatrics or emergency medicine residency program, both of which last on average five years. Residents, however, will not complete the entire residency program as they will, upon starting their final year of residency, switch to the other residency program in order to receive training in both specialties. This switch usually extends the length of the residency by a few years. As such, the residency program in its entirety usually has a length of about 6 years and leads to certification by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. In the 2010,Many institutions, such as McGill University, Universit√© de Montr√©al, Universit√© de Sherbrooke, and Universit√© Laval in the province of Quebec, offer this residency program in collaboration with various hospital training centres.

Limiting efficiencies =One band= Luque and Marti first derived a theoretical limit for an IB device with one midgap energy level using detailed balance. They assumed no carriers were collected at the IB and that the device was under full concentration. They found the maximum efficiency to be 63.2%, for a bandgap of 1.95eV with the IB 0.71eV from either the valence or conduction band. Under one sun illumination the limiting efficiency is 47%. =Infinite bands= Green and Brown expanded upon these results by deriving the theoretical efficiency limit for a device with infinite IBs. By introducing more IB‚Äôs, even more of the incident spectrum can be utilized. After performing the detailed balance, they found the maximum efficiency to be 77.2%. This efficiency is less than that of a multijunction cell with infinite junctions. This is because in multijunction cells, electrons are captured exactly after being excited to a higher energy state, while in an IB device, the electrons still need another energy transition to reach the conduction band and be collected. Current technology IBs have theoretical potential to become high efficiency devices, but they are hard to make. Introducing an IB greatly increases non-radiative recombination mechanisms. Additionally, IBs need to be partially filled to allow for carrier movement to and from the IB. This often requires donor carriers. The three current methods of fabricating IB devices are described below. =Quantum dots= The first method is to introduce small, homogenous QD structures into a single junction device. This creates an IB, which can be tuned by changing the shape and size of the QDs. For an experimental device to show high efficiency potential, it must demonstrate that it can generate current from the absorption of sub-bandgap photons, while preserving the output voltage of the device. Using quantum dots, some experimental devices, such as InAs/GaAs, have been able to do this. InAs/GaAs devices have been able to produce efficiencies as high as 18.3%, although this is still lower than the comparable single junction device. Unfortunately, QD structures have several issues: # The introduced IB is often empty, requiring donor carriers to partially fill it. # The devices are typically only effective at low temperatures as they are prone to thermal escape. # The use of QDs increases non-radiative recombination, which decreases sub-bandgap performance. # Increasing the amount of QD layers can improve sub-bandgap performance, but also increases the lattice strain on the device. Therefore, more research is needed to fabricate truly high efficient devices. Specifically, high-density QD structures with long carrier lifetimes need to be developed and new materials need to be found to eliminate the need to use donor carriers to fill the IB. =Highly mismatched alloys= Another method of fabricating an IB device is to use highly mismatched alloys. The use of these mismatched alloys introduces an IB due to the band anti-crossing (BAC) mechanism. This is essentially the splitting of the valence or conduction band, depending on the alloy type, into two bands. These materials are typically made of III-V alloys, however they have also been fabricated with II-VI alloys. The two most studied alloys are ZnTe doped with O and GaAs doped with N. Both of these devices have experimentally shown the absorption of sub-bandgap photons, however neither has been able to demonstrate voltage preservation. Despite this, ZnTeO devices have demonstrated a higher photocurrent and efficiency than a comparable single bandgap ZnTe device. Unfortunately, both structures exhibit efficiency less than 1%. Moving forward, more research is needed to find materials with natural partially filled IB bands. =Bulk materials with deep level impurities= Finally, the last approach is to introduce deep level impurities (DLI) into a semiconductor bulk material. This method is similar to highly mismatched alloys, however the doping percentages are much less. The biggest issue with these devices is that the non-radiative recombination, predominantly Shockley-Read-Hall, significantly increases. Significant research in this field was aimed at achieving ‚Äúlifetime recovery‚Äù, or the ability to increase carrier lifetime by introducing more DLIs. In particular, it was believed that lifetime recovery could be achieved by increasing the DLI concentrations to the insulator to metal transition. Krich, however, disproved this and in the process proposed a ‚Äúfigure of merit‚Äù to determine if materials would be suitable for high efficiency IB‚Äôs. The idea was that if the non- radiative recombination lifetime was significantly higher than the transit time for an electron to move from the conduction band to the IB, then the material could increase efficiency. Essentially, the electron could reach the IB before recombining, leading to a higher induced photocurrent. This figure of merit has been used to explain why no usable device has been fabricated using highly doped silicon. Chalcogen doped silicon, in particular, have low figures of merit due to their small non-radiative recombination lifetimes. To achieve IB devices, more research needs to be done to find a bulk semiconductor material that exhibits higher non-radiative recombination lifetimes.

It is the first part of the \\"Years of Cholera\\" trilogy continuing with Sweet Bunch (1983) and ending with The Loser Takes It All (2002). Plot The director studied the transformation of social values using the example of a group of five friends who meet after a long separation and share with each other the details of their difficult lives. The film became the symbol of the 1950s generation and reflected his personal views on the problem of alienation in the modern world. The film was shot in a surreal way with a predilection for the aesthetics of the Marquis de Sade. In it, for the first time in Nikolaidis' filmography, one can see the characteristic elements of film noir which became part and parcel of Nikolaidis' unique approach in the majority of the films that followed. The film follows four men who had been adolescents in the 1950s and are now in their forties.

The Sisters School District purchased property for the high school in 1938. The land was bought from the Oregon and Western Colonization Company, which owned unused right-of-way along U.S. Route 20. The lot acquired for the high school is a triangular parcel of land on the southeast side of Sisters. It is bordered by Locust Street on the east and Cascade Avenue on the north with Route 20 running diagonally along the southwest side of the property. The high school was built in 1939 as a Public Works Administration project, one of many public schools funded by the United States Federal Government during the Great Depression.\\"Old Sisters High School\\", The Sisters Country Historical Information Tour, Sisters Area Chamber of Commerce, Sisters, Oregon, accessed 3 December 2014. It was financed with a Public Works Administration grant of $8,550 along with $14,000 in bonds issued by the Sisters School District. The high school's architectural style is colonial revival, a common design type for public schools constructed during the 1930s. The building was designed by John E. Isted, an architect from Bend, Oregon. The construction contract was won by O. C. Hart of Redmond, Oregon with a bid of $22,138. Hart began work on the building in late December 1938. The structure was completed in May 1939. It was furnished over the summer so it was ready to host classes in September 1939. The high school was officially opened on 6 September 1939 with 20 students enrolled. The high school served the Sisters community until the 1960s, when the local tax base could no longer support an independent high school. In 1969, the Sisters School District closed the high school.

However, the old high school building was inadequate for the community's educational needs. As a result, the school district built a new high school which opened in 1992. In 2003, a newer high school was built and the facility built in 1992 was converting into a junior high school. The newest Sisters High School is located on the west side of town. \\"Sisters Timeline\\", Sister Oregon Guide, The Nugget Newspaper Inc, Sisters, Oregon, 2014. In 2005, the historic high school underwent a major renovation. The local school board financed the project by selling excess school district property. The renovation included preservation of wood paneling, school lockers, and drinking fountains as well as restoration of window frames and other exterior features. The project also converted the building into an administration office for the Sisters School District, keeping the historic character of the building while giving it a new economically viable purpose. The renovation project was very successful in restoring and modernizing the structure of the building while maintaining its original character. Because of the building's importance to the Sisters community and its association with the Public Works Administration and the New Deal, the old Sisters High School was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.  Structure  The exterior is a traditional colonial revival style fa√ßade. The building is one story high with a partial basement for utilities and storage. It has a rectangular footprint measuring east‚Äìwest and north‚Äìsouth. The perimeter foundation is made of steel reinforced concrete. The structural walls are a steel-reinforced wooden frame with a textured red brick veneer exterior. This combination makes the structure extremely solid. The rear fa√ßade, once the front of the buildingThe building has a hip roof with composition shingles. The peak of the roof is above ground level. There is a horizontal box cornice that runs along the roof eave. It serves as the top frame for the building's large windows. The windows are symmetrically places in sets of five in two main banks on the north and south sides of the building. There are also three sets of two windows on the south side below the gable where the original entrance was once located. All the windows are eight-over-eight double-hung wood sash windows. The four main window banks also have eight-pane awning windows above the eight-over-eight windows. There is a single pair of eight-over-eight windows near the north end on the east and west sides of the building. Both the east and west sides of the building have a double-door entrance with a fifteen-pane transom window above the doors. The original pediment entrance was in the center of the south side of the building. However, that entrance was closed and covered with brick facing during the 2005 renovation. Also during that 2005 makeover a new main entrance was created in the center of the north fa√ßade where the external basement entrance was originally located. The new main entrance is a colonial revival style pediment portico with a clapboard covered gable end. It was carefully designed to be compatible with the historic character of the building.  Interior  Inside the school, the interior rooms are set along both sides of a main hallway that runs the length of the building. The main corridor connects the double-door entrances on the east and west sides of the building. It is wide and lined with steel lockers on both sides of the hallway. There is also a multi-faucet drinking fountain located in the main hallway. The corridor has knotty pine paneling on the lower portion of the walls, framing the banks of lockers and classroom doors. Above the paneling, the walls are painted plaster. The main entrance joins the main hallway in the center of the building. Originally, there were four classrooms, two on each side of the main corridor. Each classroom had two separate doors connecting to the main hallway. During the 2005 renovation, two of the classrooms were restored to their original configuration. Both of the classrooms are long wide. The other two classrooms were divided up into individual work rooms and offices. All of the classrooms and offices have large windows designed to let in a maximum level of natural light. There are restrooms located off the main corridor at the northeast and northwest corners of the building. Each restroom has a pair of eight-over-eight double-hung windows. These windows are on the east and west sides of the building. There are three offices that open onto the hallway across from the new main entrance. This is where the original entrance and foyer was located. The stairwell to the basement is also located in this area, just off the main hallway. The basement is much smaller than the first floor. It is a space running perpendicular to the main hallway on the floor above. There are three small rooms off a basement hallway.

Knopf in 1960. It won the National Book Award for Fiction in 1961. According to Penn State University, \\"this is the story of John Donner, an aging writer who has driven from the West Coast back to Unionville, Pennsylvania, where he grew up. He discovers that the town he once knew has been submerged under the Kronos River because of a dam created to supply power for a hydroelectric plant. After viewing where the residents of the town cemeteries have been relocated, Donner finds himself on a road that went through Unionville to coal mines, where he improbably sees a wagon carrying coal and seemingly rides this wagon into the past. Once there, he finds it is the night before his grandfather's funeral, and although he knows the town and its inhabitants, they do not know him.\\" Richter describes the town and its inhabitants in sensual detail: > \\"The silent shadows of toads hopped in the garden. Occasional townspeople > would pass on the street, the girls in light summer dresses, and all the > time the drift of voices from front porches where families sat with > occasional words between them or to those passing and pausing to chat and > tell some news, so that by the time one went from Mill to Maple Street a > social evening could be passed.\\" Tension builds as Donner longs for his family to know and love him while they show him only distant, courteous hospitality.

It operates the largest electronic trading platform in the U.S. by number of daily average revenue trades. The company brokers stocks, options, futures, EFPs, futures options, forex, bonds, and funds. The company is headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut and has offices in four cities. It is the largest subsidiary of the brokerage group Interactive Brokers Group, Inc., which was founded by Chairman Thomas Peterffy, an early innovator in computer-assisted trading. IB is regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the New York Stock Exchange, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, National Futures Association, Chicago Mercantile Exchange and other self-regulatory organizations. The company is a provider of fully disclosed, omnibus, and non-disclosed broker accounts and provides correspondent clearing services to 200 introducing brokers worldwide. The company serves 607,000 client brokerage accounts, with US$128.4 billion in customer equity. Interactive Brokers Group owns 40 percent of the futures exchange OneChicago, and is an equity partner and founder of the Boston Options Exchange. The original organization was first created as a market maker in 1977 under the name T.P. & Co., and was renamed Timber Hill Inc. in 1982. It became the first to use fair value pricing sheets on an exchange trading floor in 1979, and the first to use handheld computers for trading, in 1983. In 1987, Peterffy also created the first fully automated algorithmic trading system, to automatically create and submit orders to a market. Between 1993 and 1994, the corporate group Interactive Brokers Group was created, and the subsidiary Interactive Brokers LLC was created to control its electronic brokerage, and to keep it separate from Timber Hill, which conducts market making. In 2014, Interactive Brokers became the first online broker to offer direct access to IEX, a private forum for trading securities. Currently about 16.6 percent of the company is publicly held, while the remainder is held by employees and their affiliates; Thomas Peterffy is the largest shareholder. History Peterffy talking about his handheld computers in a CNBC interview, 2016 In 1977, Thomas Peterffy left his job designing commodity trading software for Mocatta Metals, and bought a seat on the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) as an individual market maker. The following year, he formed his first company, named T.P. & Co., to expand trading activities to several members under badge number 549. At the time, trading used an open outcry system; Peterffy developed algorithms to determine the best prices for options and used those on the trading floor, and thus the firm became the first to use daily printed fair value pricing sheets. In 1979, the company expanded to employ four traders, three of whom were AMEX members. In 1982, Peterffy renamed T.P. & Co. to Timber Hill Inc.; he named it after a road to a favorite retreat, one of his properties on Hutchin Hill Road in Woodstock, New York. By 1983, Peterffy was sending orders to the floor from his upstairs office; he devised a system to read the data from a Quotron machine by measuring the electric pulses in the wire and decoding them. The data would be then sent through Peterffy's trading algorithms, and then Peterffy would call down the trades. After pressure to become a true market maker and keep constant bids and offers, Peterffy knew that he would need his employees to closely pay attention to market movements, and that handheld computers would help. At the time, the AMEX didn't permit computers on the trading floor. Because of this, Peterffy had an assistant deliver market information from his office in the World Trade Center. In November 1983 he convinced the exchange to allow computer use on the floor. In 1983, Peterffy sought to computerize the options market, and he first targeted the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). At the time, brokers still used fair value pricing sheets, which were by then updated once or twice a day. In 1983, Timber Hill created the first handheld computers used for trading. As Peterffy explained in a 2016 interview, the battery-powered units had touch screens for the user to input a stock price and it would produce the recommended option prices, and it also tracked positions and continually repriced options on stocks. However, he immediately encountered opposition from the heads of the exchange. When he first brought a by device to the exchange floor, a committee in the exchange told him it was too big. When he made the device smaller, the committee stated that no analytic devices were allowed to be used on the exchange floor. Effectively blocked from using the CBOE, he sought to use his devices in other exchanges. Images of the displays used at the NYSE to direct traders Also in 1983, Timber Hill expanded to 12 employees and began trading on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. In 1984, Timber Hill began coding a computerized stock index futures and options trading system and, in February 1985, Timber Hill's system and network was brought online. The system was designed to centrally price and manage risk on a portfolio of equity derivatives traded in multiple locations around the country. In 1985, Peterffy introduced his computer system to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which allowed it. However, the stock exchange only allowed it to be used at trading booths several yards away from where transactions were executed. Peterffy responded by designing a code system for his traders to read colored bars emitted in patterns from the video displays of computers in the booths. This caused the exchange and other members to be suspicious of insider trading, which convinced Timber Hill to distribute instructions throughout the exchange, describing how to read the displays. In response, the exchange required the company to turn the screens away from the trading floor, which prompted Peterffy to hire a clerk to communicate with the traders via hand signals. Eventually computers were allowed on the trading floor. alt=The 1973‚Äì2001 World Trade Center seen from the Hudson River Timber Hill joined the Options Clearing Corporation in 1984, the New York Futures Exchange in 1985, and the Pacific Stock Exchange and the options division of the NYSE the following year. Also in 1985, the firm joined and began trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Board Options Exchange. In 1986, the company moved its headquarters to the World Trade Center to control activity at multiple exchanges. Peterffy again hired workers to sprint from his offices to the exchanges with updated handheld devices, which he later superseded with phone lines carrying data to computers at the exchanges. Peterffy later built miniature radio transmitters into the handhelds and the exchange computers to allow data to automatically flow to them. In 1987, Timber Hill joined the National Securities Clearing Corporation and the Depository Trust Company (now merged as the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation). By 1987, Timber Hill had 67 employees and had become self-clearing in equities. In 1987, the CBOE was about to close down its S&P; 500 options market due to the options not attracting sufficient trader interest. Because of this, Peterffy pledged that Timber Hill would make tight markets in the product for a year if the exchange would allow the traders to use handheld computers on the trading floor. The exchange agreed, and more traders were attracted by the change in pricing; today S&P; 500 options are the most actively traded index options in the U.S. In 1990, Timber Hill Deutschland GmbH was incorporated in Germany, and shortly thereafter began trading equity derivatives at the Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), marking the first time that Timber Hill used one of its trading systems on a fully automated exchange. In 1992, Timber Hill began trading at the Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange, which merged with DTB in 1998 to become Eurex. At that time, Timber Hill had 142 employees. While Peterffy was trading on the Nasdaq in 1987, he created the first fully automated algorithmic trading system. It consisted of an IBM computer that would pull data from a Nasdaq terminal connected to it and carry out trades on a fully automated basis. The machine, for which Peterffy wrote the software, worked faster than a trader could. Upon inspection, the Nasdaq banned direct interface with the terminal, and required trades to be typed in manually. Peterffy and his team designed a system with a camera to read the terminal, a computer to decode the visual data, and mechanical fingers to type in the trade orders, which was then accepted by the Nasdaq. =1993 to 2000= Interactive Brokers Inc. was incorporated in 1993 as a U.S. broker-dealer, to provide technology developed by Timber Hill for electronic network and trade execution services to customers. In 1994, Timber Hill Europe began trading at the European Options Exchange, the OM Exchange and the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange. Also in 1994, Timber Hill Deutschland became a member of the Belgium Futures and Options Exchange, IB became a member of the New York Stock Exchange, and the Timber Hill Group LLC was formed as a holding company of Timber Hill and IB's operations. In 1995, Timber Hill France S.A. was incorporated and began making markets at the March√© des Options N√©gociables de Paris (a subsidiary of Euronext Paris) and the March√© √† Terme International de France futures exchange. Also in 1995, Timber Hill Hong Kong began market making at the Hong Kong Futures Exchange and IB created its primary trading platform Trader Workstation and executed its first trades for public customers. In 1996, Timber Hill Securities Hong Kong Limited was incorporated and began trading at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. In 1997, Timber Hill Australia Pty Limited was incorporated in Australia, and Timber Hill Europe began trading in Norway and became a member of the Austrian Derivatives Exchange. By 1997, Timber Hill had 284 employees. In 1998, Timber Hill Canada Company was formed, and IB began to clear online trades for retail customers connected directly to Globex to trade S&P; futures. In 1999, IB introduced a smart order routing linkage for multiple-listed equity options and began to clear trades for its customer stocks and equity derivatives trades. Also in 1999, Goldman Sachs attempted to purchase the company and was turned away. In 2000, Interactive Brokers (U.K.) Limited was formed and Timber Hill became a Primary Market Maker on the International Securities Exchange (ISE). =2001 to present= Company trading floor In 2001, the corporate name of the Timber Hill Group LLC was changed to Interactive Brokers Group LLC, which at the time handled 200,000 trades per day. In 2002, Interactive Brokers, along with the Bourse de Montr√©al and the Boston Stock Exchange, created the Boston Options Exchange. Also in 2002, IB introduced Mobile Trader and an application programming interface for customers and developers to integrate their mobile phone systems with the IB trading system. In 2002, Timber Hill became the major market maker for the newly introduced U.S. single-stock futures. In 2003, Interactive Brokers expanded its trade execution and clearing services to include Belgian index options and futures, Canadian stocks, equity/index options and futures, Dutch index options and futures, German equity options, Italian index options and futures, Japanese index options and futures, and U.K. equity options. In 2004, IB introduced direct market access to its customers on the Frankfurt and Stuttgart exchanges. In the same year, IB upgraded its account management system and Trader Workstation, adding real- time charts, scanners, fundamental analytics, and tools BookTrader and OptionTrader to the platform. In 2005, IB released its forex trading platform IdealPro (now Ideal FX). In 2006, the IB Options Intelligence Report was launched to report on unusual concentrations of trading interests and changing levels of uncertainty in the option markets. Also in that year, IBG took stakes in OneChicago, the ISE Stock Exchange, and the CBOE Stock Exchange. In 2006, Interactive Brokers started offering penny-priced options. On May 3, 2007, IBG held its initial public offering (IPO) through the Nasdaq and sold 40 million shares at $30.01 ($ in ) per share. It was run as a Dutch auction handled by WR Hambrecht (which handled Google's IPO similarly in 2004) and HSBC; it was the second-largest U.S. IPO that year and the largest brokerage IPO since 2005. The shares sold represented approximately 10 percent of the interest in IBG LLC. Also in 2007, a real-time Portfolio Margin platform was introduced for customers trading multiple asset classes, providing increased leverage with real-time risk management; as well, the company introduced exchanges for physicals for customers to exchange stocks and futures with a market-determined rate. In 2008, the company released Risk Navigator, a real- time market risk management platform. Also in 2008, several trading algorithms were introduced to the Trader Workstation. Among these is the Accumulate- Distribute Algo, which allows traders to divide large orders into small non- uniform increments and release them at random intervals over time to achieve better prices for large volume orders. In 2009, IB launched iTWS, a mobile trading app based on IB's Trader Workstation; it also released the Portfolio Analyst tool. In 2011, the company introduced several new services, including the Interactive Brokers Information System, Hedge Fund Capital Introduction Program, and the Stock Yield Enhancement Program. Interactive Brokers also became in 2011 the largest online U.S. broker as measured by daily average revenue trades. During the Occupy Wall Street protests of 2011‚Äì2012, IB ran a series of television commercials with the catchphrase \\"Join the 1%\\", which were seen as a controversial criticism of the protests. In 2012, IB began offering money manager accounts and opened the fully electronic Money Manager Marketplace. IB also released the TWS Mosaic trading interface and the Tax Optimizer for managing capital gains and losses. In 2013, IB released the Probability Lab tool and Traders' Insight, a service that provides daily commentary by Interactive Brokers traders and third party contributors. Also in 2013, IB integrated its trading notification tool (called IB FYI) into the TWS. The tool keeps customers informed of upcoming announcements that could impact their account, and a customer can set it to automatically act to exercise options early if the action is projected to be beneficial for the customer. An IB FYI also can act to automatically suspend a customer's orders before the announcement of major economic events that influence the market. On April 3, 2014, Interactive Brokers became the first online broker to offer direct access to IEX, a private electronic communication network for trading securities, which was subsequently registered as an exchange. In 2015, IB created the service Investors' Marketplace, which allows customers to find investors and other service providers in the financial industry. IB also gained clients through Scottrade that year; Scottrade had previously offered complex option trading through its platform OptionsFirst, and began offering trading through IB's platform. In March 2016, IB released a companion app to iTWS for the Apple Watch. In May 2017, IB announced the sale of the market making business conducted by its Timber Hill subsidiary, including its market making software, to New York-based Two Sigma Securities. Operations IB Technical Operations Interactive Brokers is the largest electronic brokerage firm in the US by number of daily average revenue trades, and is the leading forex broker. Interactive Brokers also targets commodity trading advisors, making it the fifth-largest prime broker servicing them. IB is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the New York Stock Exchange, the Financial Conduct Authority and other regulators and self-regulatory organizations. It provides correspondent clearing services to 200 introducing brokers worldwide. The company serves 720 thousand client brokerage accounts, with $170.1 billion in customer equity. Interactive Brokers Group has $75 million in tangible assets, including $24 million in computer equipment. Currently about 17.3 percent of the company is publicly held, while the remainder is held by employees; Thomas Peterffy is the largest shareholder. Peterffy has described the company as similar to Charles Schwab Corporation or TD Ameritrade, however, specializing in providing brokerage services to larger customers and charging low transaction costs. He also described the company's focus on building technology over having high sales, with technology often used to automate systems in order to service customers at a low cost. The company can afford to focus on automation and acquiring customers over focusing on financial results, as 82.7% of the company is held by employees. It has offered direct market access to Australian contracts for difference since 2008. Mobile transactions account for about 10% of the company's retail orders. Investors can open accounts online and there is no minimum required, though maintenance fees are sometimes charged. New customers are directed towards Traders' Academy, the company's education resource, which includes series of videos on IB's products and trading tools. =Employees= Interactive Brokers Group has nine directors, including Thomas Peterffy, Chairman of the Board of Directors, who as the largest shareholder is able to elect board members. The company has 1,649 employees; 1,365 of them hold company stock. Interactive Brokers employs computer programmers and IT workers; programmers outnumber other employees five to one. Approximately nine percent of employees work in legal or regulatory compliance departments. Among the company's directors are Lawrence E. Harris, a professor at the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business, and who was Chief Economist of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

It is an elaboration of the canonical Yulanpen Sutra which was translated from Indic sources by Dharmarak·π£a sometime between 265 and 311 CE. Maudgalyayana (Pali: '), whose abbreviated Chinese transliteration is Mulian,Mulian is the preferred Chinese transliteration for Maudgalyayana. We also see Mujianlian and Damujianlian. seeks the help of the Buddha to rescue his mother, who has been reborn in the preta world (in canonical sutra) or in the Avici Hell (in elaborated tale), the karmic retribution for her transgressions. Mulian cannot rescue her by his individual effort, however, but is instructed by the Buddha to offer food and gifts to monks and monasteries on the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month, which established the Ghost Festival (). While Mulian's devotion to his mother reassured East Asians that Buddhism did not undermine the Confucian value of filial piety and helped to make Buddhism into a Chinese religion, it also reflected strong undercurrents of filial piety that existed throughout Indian Buddhism as evidenced through its canonical texts and epigraphical remains. The story developed many variations and appeared in many forms. Tang dynasty texts discovered early in the twentieth century at Dunhuang in Gansu revealed rich stories in the form of chuanqi ('transmissions of the strange') or bianwen ('transformation tales'). Mulian and his mother appeared onstage in operas, especially folk-opera, and have been the subject of films and television series. The story became a standard part of Buddhist funeral services, especially in the countryside, until the end of the twentieth century. The legend spread quickly to other parts of East Asia, and was one of the earliest to be written down in the literature of Korea, Vietnam, and Japan. Another canonical version similar to the Yulanpen Sutra, has SƒÅriputta as the chief protagonist and is recorded in the TheravƒÅda Petavatthu. It is the basis of the custom of offering foods to the hungry ghosts and the Ghost Festival in the cultures of Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Laos.How Did Moggallana and Sariputta Rescue their Mothers from the Hungry Ghost Realm?  Stages in the popularization of a canonical sutra  450px = Possible Indic precursors of canonical text and early history = The Indian ancient classic epic, the Mahabharata, includes the story of an ascetic, Jaratkaru who sees his ancestors hanging upside down in purgatory because he has not married. His parents begged him to married so they could be reborn in Heaven. This is based on the Tang Dynasty Sanskrit etymology of the Chinese word 'Yulanpen' said to be derived from Sanskrit 'avalambana' or 'hanging upside down'. Recent studies by Karashima has cast doubts on this and other old etymologies and have affirmed the connection of the Yulanpen holiday with the Pravarana holiday. The Petavatthu No. 14 ‚Äì The Story of the Mother of Sariputta, a Theravadan scripture in the Pali Canon, contains an account of the disciple SƒÅriputta rescuing his deceased mother from his previous fifth life as an act of filial piety. Like other accounts in the Petavatthu, it also records the reasons for her rebirth into the preta world. The first reference to the Petavatthu is in the Mahavamsa's account of Venerable Mahinda using it to teach Sri Lankans ca. 3rd century BCE.. Langer's reference refers to Norman who refers ultimately to Mahavamsa's account re: Mahinda. This may be the earliest Indic precursor to the Yulanpen Sutra. Another canonical account can be found in Avadanasataka which is also very similar to the Yulanpen Sutra, Maudgalyayana communicates on the behalf of five hundred pretas with their respective relatives who in turn make offerings on the pretas' behalf to the monastic community. Once the transference of merit is completed, the former pretas are reborn and release from their suffering. Also Sanskrit fragments of this account have been found. The Yulanpen Sutra or Ullambana Sutracf Karashima (2013), esp. p 301-2 is an Indic text translated into Chinese in the 3rd to 4th century CE, which records the time when Maudgalyayana achieves abhij√±ƒÅ and uses his new found powers to search for his deceased parents. Maudgalyayana discovers that his deceased mother was reborn into the preta or hungry ghost realm. She was in a wasted condition and Maudgalyayana tried to help her by offering her a bowl of rice. Unfortunately as a preta, she was unable to eat the rice as it was transformed into burning coal. Maudgalyayana then asks the Buddha to help him; whereupon Buddha explains how one is able to assist one's current parents and deceased parents in this life and in one's past seven lives by willingly offering food, etc., to the sangha or monastic community during Pravarana (the end of the monsoon season or vassa), which usually occurs on the 15th day of the seventh month whereby the monastic community transfers the merits to the deceased parents, etc., The earliest attested celebration of the festival appears in much later sources, such as the early 7th-century Record of the Seasons of Jingchu (which is a revision of an earlier text with same title from the mid 6th century CE that is no longer extant); however based on references in various literary sources, it may have been celebrated even as early as the late 5th century CE. The sutra was in part translated and promoted to help reconcile Buddhism with the Confucian ideals of filial piety;however there was already a concept of filial piety within Indian Buddhism which had a large overlap with the Chinese version but also significant differences. (c.f. Anantarika-karma). = Tang dynasty tales of karmic punishment and redemption = In the Tang dynasty, Mulian was a popular topic of sutra lectures by monks. They often used pictures and songs to amuse their audiences, enriching the Mulian story with many variations and making it thoroughly Chinese. The story-tellers shaped their stories to meet the charge that Buddhism undermined filial piety because it took believers away from their families and prevented them from attending to their ancestors. The written versions of these stories were bianwen, of which a large number were preserved in the library cave at Dunhuang, an oasis in Central Asia, and not rediscovered until the twentieth century. thumbright350pxTortures of Chinese Buddhist Hell (including those who take money intended for templesTraditional woodblock print, reproduced in The fullest and most important of these Dunhuang texts is \\"MaudgalyƒÅyana: Transformation Text on MahamaudgalyƒÅyana Rescuing His Mother from the Underworld, With Pictures, One Scroll, With Preface.\\" In this text, Mulian's original name is \\"Radish\\", or \\"Turnip,\\" typical Chinese nicknames, and his mother is Liu Qingti. Before Radish became a Buddhist, he went abroad on business and gave his mother money for feeding monks and beggars. She stingily hides it away, and soon after Radish returns, dies and the Jade Emperor judges that she should be turned over to Yama, ruler of the underworld, and dropped to the lowest order of hell for her selfish deception. Mulian becomes a Buddhist and uses his new powers to travel to heaven. There his father informs him that his mother is suffering extremely in the Avƒ´ci Hell, the cruelest of the purgatories. Mulian descends and meets ox-headed devils who force sinners to cross the river to hell and to embrace hot copper pillars that burn away their chests. But by the time Mulian locates his mother she has been nailed down with forty-nine iron spikes. He seeks Buddha's help and is given a rod to smash prison walls and release the prisoners of hell to a higher reincarnation, but his mother is not released. Mulian's mother is reborn as a hungry ghost who can never eat her fill because her neck is too thin. Mulian tries to send her food by placing it on the ancestral altar, but the food bursts into flame just as it reaches her mouth. To rescue her from this torture, the Buddha instructs Mulian and all filial sons to provide a grand feast of \\"y√ºlan bowls\\" on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, the time when monks emerge from their summer retreat. When his mother is reincarnated once gain, this time as a black dog, Mulian recites sutras for seven days and seven nights, and his mother is reborn as a human again. In the end she is reborn again and can attain the joys of heaven. Filial emotion is vivid in this version. Mulian's mother calls him \\"my filial and obedient son,\\" while Mulian \\"chokes and sobs with his tears falling like rain.\\" As in the Yulanpen Sutra, she only can be redeemed by group action of all the monks, not any one monk. Mulian, a good Chinese son, exclaims that the most important thing is \\"the affection of one's parents and their kindness most profound.\\" As Guo puts it, by the late Tang, \\"the Buddhist embrace of filial piety seems to have been taken for granted...\\" and the way was opened for further synthesis in later dynasties\\". The stories sometimes use earthy characterization. When Mulian's mother is reincarnated as a black dog, Mulian seeks her out and she concedes that she is better off than she had been as a hungry ghost. As a dog, she says: :\\"I can go or stay, sit or lie as I choose. If I am hungry I can always eat human excrement in the privy; if I am thirsty, I can always quench my thirst in the gutter. In the morning I hear my master invoking the protection of the Tree Treasures [Buddha, the Religion, and the Community]; in the evening I hear his wife reciting the noble scriptures. To be a dog and have to accept the whole realm of impurities is a small price to pay for never so much as hearing the word 'Hell' said in my ear.\\" In another version, \\"The Mulian Legend,\\" Mulian's mother, Liu Qingti, had been pious but after her husband died took up sacrificing animals to eat meat, resorted to violence, and cursed. When she dies, the Jade Emperor judges that she should be sent to the underworld. Yama, ruler of the underworld, dispatches demons to take her, and she lies to them and to her son, saying that she has not eaten meat or done wrong things. The demons then take her away.  Operas  The folk opera \\"Mulian Rescues his Mother\\" has been called \\"the greatest of all Chinese religious operas,\\" often performed for the Ghost Festival on the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month. The performance \\"presented the mysteries of death and rebirth in scenes whose impact on audiences must have been overwhelming\\" and which taught the audience religious and moral values, though not always in orthodox form. In the Ming dynasty, Zheng Zhizhen () (1518‚Äì1595), a native of the Huizhou, Anhui, village of Qingxi, Zhenyuan County, wrote the opera Mulian jiu mu xing xiao xi wen (Mulian rescues his mother).Mulian Rescues His Mother ÁõÆËìÆÊïëÊØçË°åÂ≠ùÊà≤Êñá World Digital Library. According to local legend, Zheng was blind when he wrote the opera and was restored to full sight by a grateful Guanyin (the legend also has it that when Zheng later wrote a love story he went blind again). Zheng's opera places emphasis on Confucian family values.  Mulian in the twentieth century  On the mainland, the genre started to decline in popularity after the 1920s. However, the Mulian opera revived when it was listed as a National Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2006. But even supporters in the People's Republic see the future as under threat from high-tech television and films. There are several further challenges. In the past, the opera was passed on orally through family troupes which kept their skills to themselves. However, these troupes no longer exist. The opera is difficult to perform. The ghost roles involve acrobatic skills which require years of training. Since it is a genre that has a small audience, performers require government support. Some observers point to signs for hope, however. While traditional village audiences have dwindled, some film stars and celebrities have taken up the art. Local authorities in Huangshan City, Anhui province, have also promoted performances as a tourist attraction.Mulian Opera 'Ghost Drama' Revival Women of China March 24, 2011. The performance of Mulian Rescues His Mother in Taiwan (along with other funeral related performances) is gradually disappearing. The reasons according to Yang, are threefold: 1\\\\. The shows are performed because many of the deceased enjoyed their performance while they were alive. These people are gradually dying out and because of the changing Taiwanese culture, these shows are no longer as popular as they once were. 2\\\\. The growth of the nuclear family and simplification of funeral ceremonies. 3\\\\. The composition of the performers are mainly middle-aged and elderly. There are few newcomers learning the traditional performances since their clientele are dying out.

It was designed by Thomas Robinson & Son and Macdonald Wagner Consulting Engineers and built in 1938 by Kell & Rigby. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 8 October 2010.  History  The Kingaroy Peanut Silos located in Haly Street, Kingaroy are a group of three concrete silos (Nos 2, 3 and 4) that were constructed between 1938 and 1951 by the Queensland Peanut Marketing Board for storage of peanuts before their processing and marketing. These large structures dominate the skyline of Kingaroy and the surrounding landscape. They are widely recognised symbols of the peanut growing and processing industry in Queensland that developed as a commercial enterprise in the South Burnett centred upon Kingaroy and which has been managed from this town since the 1920s. Although initial pastoral settlement in the Kingaroy area commenced in the 1840s when Taabinga station and Burrandowan station were taken up, the town of Kingaroy owes its establishment to the arrival of the Kilkivan branch railway in 1904. In 1898 the only resident in the vicinity of Kingaroy was Daniel Carroll who had selected a 160-acre block abutting the Kingaroy Paddock selection in 1891 and built a hut and yard for his horses. By 1900 he had erected a cottage and had selected further blocks of land adjoining his original portion. In 1902 a provisional school opened in Kingaroy with about twenty pupils. Once the Kilkivan branch railway reached the peg near the corner of the Kingaroy Paddock in 1904, the railway terminus was the impetus for the establishment of Kingaroy township. Both Carroll and Arthur Youngman, owner of the Kingaroy Paddock, auctioned town blocks at public auction during 1904. When the first train arrived, there were only three buildings - Carroll's new hotel, the Carrollee, FC Petersen's store and Carroll Cottage. After the arrival of the railway Kingaroy quickly developed as a service centre with the establishment of commercial premises such as shops and hotels. These were soon followed by public buildings, churches and schools. The seven years during which Kingaroy was the railhead were sufficient for it to establish a lasting dominance over neighbouring townships. Peanuts have been grown in Queensland since Chinese cultivators planted them on the Palmer River goldfield in the 1870s. Small acreages were grown by several farmers in the South Burnett from about 1901 and these peanuts were sold to confectioners and shops in Brisbane, Maryborough and Rockhampton. From significant acreages in the South Burnett became devoted to peanut growing. A major boost to the peanut growers was the establishment of the Marrickville Margarine Company's oil expression plant at Marrickville, New South Wales in 1921. The company purchased almost the entire 1921-1922 crop in the South Burnett and may have created the demand which made the establishment and growth of the industry possible. Further stimulus was provided by the establishment of other companies, such as Nut Foods Pty Ltd in 1924, to produce peanut products such as peanut paste and salted and roasted peanuts that entered this business around this time. Subsequently, more farmers in the South Burnett began peanut-growing. In 1922, were produced, rising to in 1923 and to in 1924. This increase in peanut growing coincided with a fall in the price received by farmers for maize, which had been their primary cash crop. However, in 1924 merchants were not prepared to pay what growers considered a reasonable price for the increased quantity of peanuts claiming there was a glut and offering prices as low as ? pence/lb. Consequently, growers refused to sell at a price insufficient to meet the costs of production. A meeting of growers held at Memerambi decided to approach the Minister for Agriculture and Stock to obtain approval for the formation of a Peanut Board under the Primary Products Pools Act 1922. Board members were elected and a strategy for marketing the current crop was established. This strategy involved transforming the crop into a marketable condition to supply quality lines and deliver the product throughout the year as the market required it. The Board did this by deshelling, grading, culling and storing the peanuts. Meanwhile, the establishment of the Queensland Peanut Marketing Board was gazetted on 23 August 1924. The result for the first year of operations was satisfactory with growers paid approximately 4 pence/pound. During the period 1919 to 1924 production for the whole of Queensland increased from. The other areas in Queensland producing peanuts were Moreton, Port Curtis, Edgecombe, Rockingham, Cape York Peninsula and the Darling Downs/Maranoa divisions. Peanuts were grown in areas such as the North Coast region where fruit farmers grew of peanuts as a side-line to their fruit production. Over time the peanut industry became concentrated in three areas of Queensland. The South Burnett, with Kingaroy as the headquarters of the Board, storage and treatment facilities, was the main area. A second area was in Central Queensland, especially along the coast, with Rockhampton as its centre. The third centre was on the Atherton Tableland with the Board's depot being located in Atherton. Storage was one of the main needs of the South Burnett peanut growers. Silos were necessary to hold the nuts in dry storage, treat them if affected by damp, protect them from pests and allow controlled distribution so that the market was not flooded one year and short the next. Initially, the Peanut Board leased local barns and nuts were treated in the Railway's Grain Shed in the Railway Yard at Kingaroy. Realising that more permanent arrangements were required it was decided to build a block of silos, complete with treatment plant and machinery. The Board imposed a levy of ¬º pence/pound on peanuts delivered to the Board to cover the cost. In order to build the silos the growers formed the Queensland Peanut Growers' Cooperative Association Ltd. The Association issued shares to the growers in lieu of the levy received from the Board. In this way the growers themselves became the owners of any assets bought or built with the proceeds of their levy. The Association was formed and registered under the Primary Producers' Cooperative Associations Act 1923 to 1926. Between September 1926 and August 1928 land fronting Haly Street and the railway line to the south was acquired as a site for operations. Located near the commercial centre of the town and adjacent to the railway line, the future headquarters of the Peanut Board was well sited for loading and unloading of produce. Accordingly, a timber-framed and -clad silo (No. 1) was constructed in 1928 together with a long shed which housed machinery for cleaning, grading and shelling peanuts. A long shed built at the same time, called the \\"Dump\\", had a storage capacity of a further . The industry continued to develop steadily with regulation by government and growers alike. Lobbying of the State and Commonwealth governments by the Board resulted in embargoes against the importation of peanuts and supportive legislation. In August 1930 the Queensland Government issued an Order-in- Council constituting a Peanut Marketing Board for 10 years to control all sales of peanuts produced in Queensland. Marketing problems were overcome finally with the passing in 1939 of The Peanut Industry Protection and Preservation Act by the Queensland government which ensured that the Board held control over the planting, grading, treatment and marketing of peanuts in Queensland through the health provisions of the Federal Constitution. Continued expansion of the peanut industry necessitated the building of additional storage space at Kingaroy. By 1937 the crop was in excess of and the chairman of the Board estimated that in the following year it would be around . This was an enormous increase from Australia's peanut production in the early 1930s, which was per year. In 1937 additional land bounding the Queensland Peanut Growers' Cooperative Association Ltd's original purchases was acquired. Plans for the proposed set of modern concrete and brick silos were drawn in September 1937. A meeting of the Board and growers in the following month approved their construction. The silos, estimated to cost approximately , were to be ready for the next peanut crop. The engineers were Thomas Robinson & Son Consulting Engineers, Sydney in association with Macdonald Wagner consulting Engineers Sydney and Brisbane. They were built by Kell & Rigby, which also constructed the Kingaroy Shire Council Chambers, located opposite, at the same time. No 2 Silo consisted of 38 silo bins in total: 24 round bins each diameter and high (to top of the cone) plus 14 star shape bins being high (to top of the cone). This silo was constructed and opened during 1938 at a cost of of which was advanced by the Commonwealth Bank under Queensland Government guarantee. The Kingaroy Peanut Silos were officially opened on 1 December 1938 by the Minister for Agriculture and Stock, Frank Bulcock. After the ceremony at the silos, Bulcock officially opened the new Kingaroy Shire Council Chambers. Conducting both of these ceremonies on the same day symbolically expressed the Shire's confidence and its progress since formation, while acknowledging its dependence on agriculture to deliver its future prosperity. The outbreak of war marked the beginning of a period of rapid development. The Commonwealth initially planned to commandeer the whole peanut crop for oil making purposes. However, as peanuts could be and were being imported in sufficient quantities for oil production, the Board challenged the acquisition order by recommending that Queensland peanuts be used mainly for edible purposes and only diverted to oil production should the need arise. This was accepted by the Australian Government and from 1943 until the end of the war the crop was sold by the Board under the control of the National Security Regulations. By 1947 peanut production had reached a new peak with 1116 growers planting which produced of peanuts valued at . This rapid expansion of the peanut industry in the 1940s again created storage problems. To solve this, two new silos were planned. The first of these (No. 3 Silo) was completed late in 1948 at cost of between and and with a capacity of . It was built on lot 138 (), which had been created from a road closure, the Deed of Grant for which was issued to the Queensland Peanut Growers' Cooperative Association Ltd after it was acquired for 8p on 6 August 1928. The second block (No. 4 Silo) was completed by 1951 although its machinery was not installed until June that year. Its capacity was and its cost upon completion was approximately . The loan for the construction of both silos was guaranteed by the Queensland Government. On 6 February 1951 fire destroyed No 1 Silo and the Dump, while No 2 Silo and No 4 Silo were damaged. No 2 Silo was repaired and the workhouse of No 4 Silo was repaired and re- equipped with treatment machinery. A bag shed and general purpose shed were later built on the site previously occupied by the Dump. Between 1959 and 1980 Queensland produced almost the entire Australian peanut crop with the South Burnett producing just over half the State's production in 1979-80. In 1992 major changes took place in the peanut industry. The marketing of peanuts in Queensland was de-regulated and the Peanut Marketing Board, which was a statutory marketing authority, was wound up on 27 May 1992. At that time the Board transferred all its assets, property and liabilities to the Queensland Peanut Growers' Co-operative Association Ltd. The Peanut Marketing Board became PMB Australia Ltd and later, in 1997, became the Peanut Company of Australia (PCA). Since then, the PCA has remained the leading supplier of peanuts in Australia, engaged in researching, growing, storing, processing, value-adding and marketing the product. The Kingaroy Peanut Silos have been a long-standing symbol, not just of South Burnett and Kingaroy but also of the Queensland peanut industry. Images of the silos have been promulgated since as early as 1938 and remain an easily recognised image in Queensland.  Description  The silos in 1945 The three free-standing silo structures known as Silos Nos 2, 3 and 4 stand prominently on Haly Street, Kingaroy, within the larger Peanut Company of Australia peanut processing plant which occupies a truncated rectangular block bounded by the streets Haly, Jarah and Alford Street East and the Kingaroy/Kilkivan railway line formation. The plant within the silo structures is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. For effective operation of the silos this plant is replaced and upgraded from time to time. Extending over eight levels (boot pit, six floors and a gallery), each silo structure consists of nests of storage bins to the north, an elevator tower to the south and accommodates plant associated with the receipt, sorting, feeding, storage and despatch of peanuts. Silo No. 2 incorporates a working house to the south of its elevator tower. Silos Nos 2 and 3 are linked by an overhead enclosed walkway at gallery level. This walkway accommodates a conveyor plant to transport peanuts between the two silos. Elevated loading/despatch platforms sheltered by suspended steel framed awnings stand to the base of tconverthe elevator towers to Silos Nos 3 and 4 and to the east and south sides of the working house to Silo No. 2. The railway tracks of the former siding run between Silos Nos 2 and 3 and are not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. The white painted concrete and brick silo bins stand on a reinforced concrete floating slab and consist of round bins in diameter and to the top of the cone and interstitial star shape bins to the top of the cone. Peanuts are dropped in from a conveyor belt at the gallery level and released from the hoppered base at the ground floor. Silo No. 2, with a capacity of {{convert4372LT} has 24 round and 14 star shape bins, Silo No. 3 has a capacity of in 27 round and 16 star shape bins and number four has a capacity of in 12 round and 6 star shape bins. The bins in each silo are crowned by a steel-and timber-framed shed clad with metal sheeting and are distinguished by high narrow gabled ridge roofs. Each shed accommodates the gallery space which houses the conveyor belt and associated plant that drops the nuts into the storage bins. A timber-floored platform runs along each side of the conveyor and the space is lit by steel-framed windows to the east, west and north. Hoppers at the base of the bins empty onto conveyor belts that transport the peanuts for despatch. The elevator towers are steel-and timber-framed, clad with metal sheeting and lit by steel- framed windows to each level. The towers accommodate flights of steel and concrete stairs and the elevator plant associated with hoisting the peanuts from the boot pit to the gallery conveyor belts. The working house of Silo No. 2 is constructed of reinforced concrete, sheltered by a hipped roof clad with metal sheeting. Banks of steel-framed 12-light windows light each of the five levels. Square in plan, the working house accommodates plant, flights of steel and concrete stairs and a passenger lift with a handsome decorative metal door housed within a weatherboard clad lift shaft. Many original steel-framed 12-light windows with a fixed louvre vent and a pivoting central section have been retained, notably in the working house and the elevator towers.  Heritage listing  Kingaroy Peanut Silos was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 8 October 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Kingaroy Peanut Silos are important in illustrating the large-scale development of the peanut industry in Queensland. Since the 1920s the South Burnett district has been the headquarters of the Queensland peanut industry, a major agricultural industry for the State. These silos were built in 1938, 1948 and 1951 and reflect the constant growth of the peanut industry in that period. The Kingaroy Peanut Silos are a striking physical manifestation of the Peanut Company of Australia and its precursor organisations, with the headquarters of the company located in Kingaroy, since 1927. These organisations have controlled and developed the peanut industry in Queensland and Australia since its inception. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The intactness, integrity and magnitude of the Kingaroy Peanut Silos, configured in cylindrical and star-shaped bins, and their proximity to the railway line make them an exceptional example of storage silos. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Standing tall above the Kingaroy skyline these high silos dominate the townscape and the landscape of the South Burnett as a landmark visible from great distances. Lit by the rising and setting sun they glow dramatically at dawn and dusk transforming their appearance from functional structure to monumental sculpture. Their recognition as an aesthetic landmark for the region is evidenced by the use of artistic images of the silos for tourism promotional purposes. The Kingaroy Peanut Silos are important for their symbolic quality and aesthetic contribution to the South Burnett landscape. The silos are a long-standing and an easily recognised symbol of Kingaroy and have value to the people of south- east Queensland as a distinctive symbol of Kingaroy, the headquarters of the Australian peanut industry.

It was designed by Waugh and Josephson and built in 1926. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 November 2012.  History  Kingaroy Butter Factory, 1929 The Kingaroy Butter Factory, a large timber clad building located in William Street, Kingaroy was built by contractors Waugh and Josephson in 1926, replacing an earlier factory established in 1907, on behalf of the Maryborough Co-operative Dairy Company. From the late 1800s, a number of critical factors enabled the expansion of the dairy industry into one of Queensland's principal primary industries by the interwar period. These included: government resumption and repurchase of land from pastoralists for the purpose of agricultural selection; the introduction of mechanical cream separators in the 1880s; Babcock testing to accurately measure cream content in milk; The Meat and Dairy Encouragement Act 1893 which made provision for government loans to construct butter and cheese factories; and the Department of Agriculture and Stock's use of a \\"Travelling Dairy\\" to demonstrate techniques and equipment to potential dairy farmers throughout Queensland. This period also saw the introduction of sown pastures such as paspalum and Rhodes grass and the cultivation of fodder, to improve milk yields and to provide adequate feed during the less productive months of winter. Effective transport infrastructure was essential for dairy products to reach their desired markets. The extension of Queensland's rural railway network enabled more efficient transportation of dairy produce, facilitating the establishment of local butter and cheese factories in close proximity to railway lines. The first shipment of butter to Britain occurred in 1895 and from 1903 government subsidisation of a fortnightly shipping service to the United Kingdom improved Queensland's butter exporting capabilities. The arrival of the Kilkivan branch railway to the \\"56 mile peg\\" in 1904 was the impetus for the establishment of the township of Kingaroy and a catalyst for the rapid expansion of dairying in the surrounding district, then an emerging but relatively small scale industry in the South Burnett. Within two years of opening, Kingaroy railway station was sending of cream weekly to Maryborough, while some farmers were also sending cream to Nanango. By the early 1900s, co-operatives, where groups of local producers banded together to establish factories, were becoming the dominant form of ownership of cheese and butter factories, a pattern that defined the Queensland dairy industry for much of the 20th century. The Maryborough Co-operative Dairy Company (MCDC) was producing butter and ice at its Maryborough factory from February 1901, with the decision to form a co- operative made in 1898. During 1905, a group of local Kingaroy dairy farmers met with directors of the MCDC and lobbied for the establishment of a branch factory at Kingaroy. The directors of the company entered into agreement to build a factory in early 1906, with 1525 shares in the company allocated to dairy farmers and other shareholders from the Kingaroy district. Company representatives selected a site in June of that year along the railway line on the northern outskirts of Kingaroy. The owner of the property, Tom Reen, donated one acre for the factory site, with the company purchasing another nineteen acres at per acre. By October construction had begun on the building, a railway siding and a well, with the factory producing butter by March 1907. The Kingaroy Butter Factory soon became an essential component of MCDC's operations, reflecting the suitability and productivity of the South Burnett district for dairying. The 1913 half yearly report of the MCDC noted () of butter had been produced at Kingaroy in the first half of the year, almost twice as much as at Maryborough and nearly more than at Biggenden (built by the MCDC in 1911). The MCDC also opened factories in Mundubbera (1916) and Wondai (1931). Throughout its history, the Kingaroy Butter Factory was the largest producer of the MCDC's five factories. By 1929, the Wide Bay district, in which the South Burnett was included, was second only to the Moreton district in Queensland milk production. In May 1925 the directors of the MCDC visited Kingaroy to announce plans to construct a new factory building with modern machinery. At an estimated cost of -, sourced from butter profits, local shareholders expressed their dissatisfaction with this arrangement, as the decision had been made without their consultation. The company directors argued that the new factory would increase productivity and increase returns to suppliers. While some shareholders voiced intentions of separating from the company prior to, and following the announcement of the new factory, this ultimately did not occur and the building proceeded. The building was constructed by Brisbane contractors Waugh and Josephson, with the final cost of more than doubling the original estimate. The construction of the building was not put out to tender and a later inquiry into secret commissions in the dairy industry implicated former Maryborough Co-operative Dairy Company Director WA Shultz in receiving payments from Waugh and Josephson for the award of the contract. The new factory was officially opened 7 October 1926 by William Forgan Smith, Minister for Agriculture and Stock. The factory was opened for inspection and a marquee was erected on the factory grounds, with a large crowd in attendance. The building of the new Kingaroy factory occurred during a period of modernisation for butter manufacturers. By the end of the 1920s, most Queensland butter factories had been remodelled or were new buildings of brick and concrete, replacing earlier timber structures. The emphasis on producing high grade butter saw the need for more churns within factories to maintain outputs, as the lower temperatures required meant churns were turning longer than previously. In addition to upgrading buildings and equipment, greater attention was paid to ensuring butter was of a high standard, through stricter grading and by employing processes of pasteurisation and neutralisation. Increasing numbers of trained staff were working in factories. The manufacture of butter followed a fairly typical process at factories throughout Queensland. Once cream cans were received at a loading dock and weighed, the cream was tested to determine its grading (choice, 2nd or 3rd), before the cans were emptied into vats and cleaned for return to the supplier. The cream was then pasteurised, cooled and pumped to storage vats, before being sent to the churns. The resulting butter was refrigerated, parcelled into butter boxes and forwarded by rail for export or distribution into local markets. In order to preserve butter during storage and transportation, the production of ice was a necessary component of operations. This process occurred at Kingaroy in a small timber building adjacent to the main building. In addition to the factory's needs, ice was also sold for other commercial and domestic uses. In the years following the construction of the new factory, butter production increased markedly, from per week during 1926-1927, to per week during 1928-1929. The factory reached its peak weekly production of and 12cwt during 1929-1930, then a record for Queensland butter production. In 1931, it was Queensland's largest butter factory in terms of production, a time when close to 1000 suppliers were selling cream to the factory. In 1932-33, Kingaroy exported a higher average grade of butter than any other Queensland factory. Throughout the 1930s, the factory won numerous awards in Australia and England for the quality of its butter. During 1938-9, a record year, almost a third of all Queensland's butter was produced in the Wide Bay-Burnett, with Kingaroy the fifth largest producer in the state. In the 1930s Kingaroy Shire had a burgeoning peanut industry and was a well established centre for maize production, but it was dairying that was the principal primary industry. As a measure of the industry's growth, the payment to Kingaroy factory suppliers in its first full financial year was . By 1934 this had grown to . At the end of 1933, cream suppliers to the factory were being paid eight pence per pound for first grade cream, seven pence for second grade. The interwar period saw the dairy industry expand greatly in Queensland. Between 1927 and 1937 the total number of dairy cattle rose by 50%. By the 1930s, dairying was Queensland's most widely spread agricultural industry and the state's second most profitable export industry from 1936 to 1941, accounting for 20% of primary production. By the late 1930s, around one in eight Queenslanders were living on dairy farms. In 1938 there were five co-operative butter factories in the South Burnett: located at Nanango, Kingaroy, Murgon, Wondai and Proston. While butter factories enabled the production and export of dairy products, numerous small farms reliant on family labour to milk herds twice daily for generally modest returns, were the backbone of the industry. During World War II, butter factories throughout Queensland were engaged in the production of cheese. The Kingaroy, Nanango and Murgon factories all produced cheese during this period. Varying sources give the commencement date for production of cheese at Kingaroy as 1941 or 1942, ending in 1946. Between March 1942 and November 1944, 1.135 million pounds of cheese was produced. An annexe was built to the rear of the main building, containing two rooms; the larger for production and the lesser for maturation and storage, with walls lined with hoop pine timber, infilled with sawdust for temperature control. After cheese production ceased the annexe was used to produce buttermilk powder. By 1950 the farms of the South Burnett were stocked with 130,000 dairy cows, ten percent of the Queensland total. The Kingaroy Butter Factory maintained an average production of of butter per week until the early 1950s. Factory improvements in this period included the purchase of a new butter wrapping machine for in 1950, and the installation of stainless steel equipment for treating cream in 1956. Such improvements, however, were not enough to protect the factory from the beginnings of a wider decline of Queensland's dairy industry, as demand and prices for butter began to drop. The downturn worsened in the 1960s, with a reduction in cream suppliers diminishing output. The transition towards the production of milk rather than cream, requiring larger herds and new equipment, saw many smaller scale farmers leaving the industry. In Kingaroy Shire cream suppliers fell dramatically, from 265 in 1965 to 155 in 1969. Correspondingly, between 1960 and 1968 the number of dairy cows in the Shire fell from 23,885 to 12,225. Export opportunities also became restricted, culminating with the end of preferential trade agreements with Britain following its entry into the European Common Market in 1973. The late 1960s saw the beginning of closures of butter factories in the Burnett region. The Proston Butter Factory, a branch of the South Burnett Dairy Co., closed in 1967. The Maryborough Co-operative Dairy Company closed their branch factories at Wondai and Biggenden in February 1969. By 1976 dairy farmers in the South Burnett numbered under 400 and of these, 211 were bulk milk suppliers. The average age of a dairyman was 55 and two dairy producers were leaving the industry per week. While Kingaroy's supply benefited in the short term from Wondai's closure, ultimately it was not enough to sustain the business. In May 1977 it was announced that both Nanango and the Kingaroy butter factories would close and that all cream supplies would be diverted to Murgon. With a large number of suppliers leaving the industry, and manufacturing and other costs dramatically increasing, it was no longer economically viable for the factories to stay open. By the time of Kingaroy Butter Factory's closure, there were only 38 suppliers and only one and a half tonnes of butter produced a week, a far cry from its interwar heyday. For a time after closing, the factory operated as a milk collection point for the Maryborough Co-operative Dairy Association. In 1989 the market milk operations and the factory was sold to Suncoast Milk, a subsidiary of Queensland United Foods. For a period during the 1980s a rear section of the building leased by Kidd's Cabinet Makers. From November 1986, Graham Helmhold began leasing the front of the building for the operations of his company Proteco, one of Australia's major cold pressed oil processors. Proteco purchased the property in 1995. This business has since changed ownership. From 2002-2009, dairy processing returned to the site, with Kingaroy Cheese using part of the main building for cheese making. This business has since relocated to Brisbane. A peanut roasting company now uses the space vacated by Kingaroy Cheese. The site is not open to the public. As of 2014, Proteco Oils has full ownership of the site and operates it offices, reception and factory outlet/sales of their oils from the old Manager's Building at the front of the site.  Description  Workers inside the churn room, 1938 The former Kingaroy Butter Factory complex stands at the northern end of William Street, Kingaroy north west of the CBD of Kingaroy and adjacent to the formation of the Kilkivan/Kingaroy railway line. The complex comprises the main butter factory shed, 1940s cheese factory, ice works shed, former office, amenities and cold stores shed, modern cheese making facility and a number of other sheds and structures. An early engine (maker's plate LG Terne Engineers of Glasgow) stands near the front gate and the entrance forecourt accommodates car parking. The site works off a road running centrally through the complex with an ancillary road to the west side. The roads and carpark are bitumened and concrete drains and edges run along the spine road. The significant structures are the Main butter factory shed, 1940s cheese factory (east and west sheds), ice works shed and former office, which are described individually below. =Main butter factory shed= The main building is a rectangular timber framed and chamferboard clad building with a slab on ground concrete floor throughout. The timber frame stands on a low concrete upstand that runs around the perimeter of the shed. A moulded timber cornice runs around the parapet that screens the sawtooth roofs behind. The sawtooth roofs are clad with corrugated metal sheeting and have south facing clerestory windows; most are glazed, some house fixed timber louvres or are clad with corrugated metal sheeting. An additional narrow rectangular raised gable roof with glazed windows to the east and west sits over part of the centre of the shed. The south, east and west elevations are notable for full height pilasters marking out bays which to the southern part of the building are punctuated by smaller pilasters which terminated in a lower cornice that is now removed. The smaller pilasters define the loading dock openings - three to the west, five to the south and six to the east. A continuous concrete ledge projects around the southern third of the building below the dock openings. Eleven original large timber braced-and-ledged vertical sliding doors remain to these openings providing access to the dock within. Rainwater heads and downpipes run down these elevations. The south elevation is distinguished by four sets of timber framed upper windows with glazed and fixed timber louvres to the upper face. The west elevation is punctuated by a number of openings including timber framed casement windows to the mezzanine office. Reflecting the receipt/despatch activities of the factory processing, the east elevation accommodates a number of hatch openings at various points along the length of the building. A number are now boarded over. Hooded exhaust vents protrude along the northern end of the elevation. The blank north elevation is clad with horizontal chamferboards and metal sheeting. The building accommodates substantially intact functional spaces reflecting the various stages in the handling and processing of milk products including engine, plant and machinery rooms, testing rooms, chill rooms, cold stores, salt room, packing rooms, cream platform, churn room, main room, receiving and despatch docks and a mezzanine office. Throughout the main building linings generally are vertical or horizontal tongue and groove boarding or fibrous cement sheeting with cover strips. The roof is generally framed with timber trusses supported on corbelled timber posts. The southern end accommodates the receiving and despatch docks, main room, cream platform, churn room, chill and cold rooms, salt room, packing rooms, testing rooms and the office mezzanine. Concrete platforms, approximately above the level of the main room, run along the east, south and west sides and form the receiving and despatch docks. These docks service the former railway siding to the east and vehicle loading area to the south and west. The deck of the cream platform is formed by the concrete ceilings of the chill and cold stores, salt room, packing and other rooms below. A fibrous cement sheeted partition runs part the way down the west side and stout timber posts continue around the perimeter. The posts to the west side carry large metal brackets that supported the pulleys and belts once associated with the motors for the churns which stood on the floor below. The main room now accommodates machinery and equipment for the current oil pressing business. The chill/cold stores, salt room and packing rooms retain original features including hatches, doors and doorways, concrete upstands and floor drains. The office mezzanine, supported by the structure of the storage spaces below, is timber framed and partly screened by partitions clad with vertical tongue and groove boards. The ceiling to the southern end is lined with fibrous cement sheeting ceilings and accommodates lattice ventilation screens to the cream platform. The northern end, formerly accommodating engine, plant and machinery areas, has exposed roof framing (some unpainted) and horizontal unpainted chamferboard linings to the interior walls. Some spaces are lined with insulation panels, have new fittings and there is new concrete screed to some floors. Some floors show evidence of tracks and plant and machinery fixings. = 1940s cheese factory = The 1940s cheese factory stands to the northern end of the site and consists of two sheds each clad with fibrous cement sheeting and sheltered by gabled roofs clad with corrugated metal sheeting. Three circular roof vents project from the west shed and two inverted tubular exhaust vents protrude from the east. The west shed and the southern third of the east shed have a painted perimeter concrete upstand, approximately high. Both sheds have fixed timber louvre vents to the north and south gable ends. = West cheese factory shed = Lettering, The Cheese Factory 1941-1946, is painted to the upper part of the south elevation of the west shed. A slab on ground concrete floor runs throughout with an elevated concrete dock to the south end. Sash windows punctuate the east, west and north sides and a horizontal sliding braced and ledged timber door opens from the south dock. Horizontal sliding metal doors open to the west and north. The interior has exposed painted timber roof trusses. The ceiling and upper walls are unlined and the lower walls are lined with fibrous cement sheeting with cover strips over the joins. A narrow band of wire mesh runs along the upper west and part of the east walls. Approximately mid-way along the east wall, a solid timber framed and lined door with a robust handle and latch provides access between the two sheds. = East cheese factory shed = This is the smaller of the two sheds, the southern third has a slab on ground floor and the rest of the shed stands on low timber stumps and is accessed by a recent ramp to the north side. The cavities in the walls are filled with sawdust for insulation. The east elevation is distinguished by three mid- height small square windows; and a low hooded hatch and a horizontal sliding metal door at the south end. The shed has a suspended timber floor and dark honey-coloured horizontal unpainted pine lining to the interior walls on which lighter shadows reveal the locations of vertical supports for the storage shelfing that once lined the room. A solid timber framed and lined door with a robust handle provides access to the south end of the shed. A concrete drain runs along the east side of the shed. = Ice works shed = Standing to the middle of the site, the former ice works shed is a small rectangular structure with a painted perimeter concrete upstand, timber framed walls clad with chamferboards and is sheltered by a gable roof clad with corrugated metal sheeting. A timber door and a set of timber framed casement windows are accommodated to the west elevation, there are doorways to the middle of the east and south elevations and the shed butts against the new cheese making facility to the north. The interior has a concrete tank to the west and an elevated concrete dock to the east side. Equipment and machinery associated with the ice works remains in the shed including the ice block moulds. = Former office = A small square timber framed building standing on low timber stumps, clad with timber weatherboards and fibrous cement sheeting and sheltered by a hipped tiled roof, the former office building stands to the south of the complex. Notable features include the front porch entrance and cantilevered timber framed window hoods.  Heritage listing  The former Kingaroy Butter Factory was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 November 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Kingaroy Butter Factory (1926) is important in demonstrating the growth of the dairy industry in the Wide Bay-Burnett, one of Queensland's most important dairy producing regions during the twentieth century. Replacing an earlier factory built in 1907, the Kingaroy Butter factory was among Queensland's largest and most awarded butter producers during the dairying boom of the interwar period. The former Kingaroy Butter Factory illustrates the evolution of Queensland's dairy industry during the interwar period, when most butter factories were remodelled or rebuilt in response to a rapid expansion of cream production and the need to adopt modern manufacturing processes. The cheese making annexe (1941) is important in demonstrating the accelerated programme of cheese production that occurred in Queensland during World War II. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former Kingaroy Butter Factory complex is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics and processes of a butter factory, a significant type of industrial activity in Queensland's history. The place is situated adjacent to a railway line, formerly served by a siding to enable transportation of its products. The intact internal arrangement of the main factory building incorporates a loading dock, storage platform, testing, churn, cold storage and packing areas, original mezzanine office and the provision of rear space for the factory's plant. Adjacent associated buildings, including the cheese annexe (1941), office () and ice manufacturing shed, illustrate activities interconnected with the production of butter on the site.

He was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, and emigrated to New Zealand in January 2010, aged 14. The eligibility of his inclusion in an Olympic qualifying game in 2015 was successfully challenged and cost New Zealand the chance of participating in the 2016 Olympic Games. Club career Wynne signed for Wanderers SC from East Coast Bays AFC in 2013. On 13 August 2015 Wynne signed with United Soccer League side Whitecaps FC 2. Whitecaps traded Wynne to Colorado Rapids on 21 December 2017, in exchange for $100,000 of Targeted Allocation Money. International career Wynne first represented New Zealand at senior level, his international debut came against China in November 2014 having been called up due to injuries to Louis Fenton, and Tom Doyle. Wynne provided the assist for Chris Wood to equalise at 1‚Äì1. He made further international appearances against Thailand four days later, and in March 2015, he played against South Korea. Wynne was selected for the New Zealand national under-20 team to play at the 2015 U-20 World Cup in May 2015. He played in all possible matches for New Zealand; three group stage games against Ukraine U-20, United States U-20, Myanmar U-20 and a Round of 16 loss against Portugal U-20. Two months later, Wynne was again selected by the New Zealand national under-23 team, known as the \\"Oly Whites\\" for the 2015 Pacific Games football tournament, he played in the final group stage game against New Caledonia. As non-Pacific Games Council members, New Zealand were not able to qualify for the Pacific Games semi- final, but as members of FIFA and IOC were able to qualify for the 2016 Summer Olympics qualifying semi-final stage. Wynne played in the semi-final, which New Zealand won 2‚Äì0 against Vanuatu. After the game, a protest was lodged by the opponents on the basis that Wynne was not an eligible player. A 3‚Äì0 victory was awarded to Vanuatu who went on to lose the Olympic qualifying final stage against Fiji on penalties after a 0‚Äì0 draw. =Eligibility= Vanuatu formally protested the eligibility of Wynne following their 2‚Äì0 loss at the semi-final stage of the Olympic Qualifying section in which Wynne featured. OFC awarded a 3‚Äì0 victory to Vanuatu after finding that Wynne was ineligible to play in the Olympic qualifying rounds. New Zealand Football announced that they would be challenging the decision, claiming that the Pacific Games Council confirmed the eligibility of the squad in advance of the tournament and that they acted in \\"good faith\\". To be eligible for the New Zealand representative team, Wynne, or a parent or grandparent would need to have been born in New Zealand, or he would have needed to have become a New Zealand citizen before the age of 18 ‚Äì the age when FIFA's requirement for a player to live on the territory of the football association for five years would take effect. An appeal to the OFC against their expulsion from Olympic qualifying was rejected in October 2015. In January 2016, New Zealand Football successfully applied for an exemption from the FIFA eligibility requirements, making Wynne eligible to play for New Zealand.

It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 December 2007.  History  The Klondyke Coke Ovens were part of the Klondyke Colliery located at Brassall and were built in the 1940s. Coke production at Klondyke originally commenced in the 1880s. The site had two widely separated periods of coke production and several changes of ownership and names. Its last change of ownership and name occurred in 1948 when the pit had only a small area left to be worked and production ceased in the early 1950s. The site has been lying unused for many years and the coke ovens are overgrown with vegetation. The discovery of coal in Queensland dates from 1825 when outcrops were observed by Major Edmund Lockyer on the banks of the upper Brisbane River. Two years later, when Ipswich was settled as a convict outstation, known as Limestone, the presence of coal was noted between the convict settlement and Brisbane by Captain Patrick Logan. The following year, explorer Allan Cunningham also marked several outcrops on the Bremer River on his survey map for Governor Ralph Darling. Coal was one of the first minerals in Queensland to be commercially mined. Mining originally commenced at Goodna in 1843 with the West Moreton Coalfield at Ipswich following in the early 1850s. Development of the coal mining industry in Queensland was slow and the quality could not match the quality of coal being produced at Newcastle for use by coastal steamers. However, as coal was required for transport and industrial use, there was remarkable growth of mining to the north and east of the town from the mid-1870s onwards. A symbiotic relationship developed between Queensland Government Railways and the coal industry. Queensland Railways was the coal industry's largest customer since coal supplies were essential to the functioning of the rail network. At the same time rail transport was essential to the viability of coalmines as a coal mine could not survive commercially unless it was directly linked to the rail network. Therefore, in Queensland, development of the coal industry was closely linked to the growth of the rail network. A by-product of coal mining was the production of coke. The production of coke was usually regarded as a somewhat unimportant side industry to the actual mining of coal. Unlike coal mining, it was not regulated by legislation and as such no systematic records were kept of the early coke production industry in Queensland. Coke is used as both a fuel and as a reducing agent in smelting iron ore and is produced from baking bituminous coal in ovens at temperatures as high as 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The coke ovens erected on the West Moreton Coalfield were exclusively of the beehive type, so called because of their domed appearance. Beehive coke ovens consisted of a brick dome with a small circular opening (an exit flue) at the apex, and a larger arched opening at one side to permit charging and drawing. They were usually constructed in double rows known as batteries. The space between ovens was usually filled with rubble and earth to provide insulation and the whole battery surrounded by a stone retaining wall to resist the outward thrust of the brick domes. The Klondyke ovens had a capacity of four to five tons. Coke ovens were charged and emptied in a set pattern. Coal was shovelled into an empty oven to a height of approximately and ignited. The door was bricked up or closed with an iron plate and plastered with a small hole left for the temporary admission of air. The upper layer of the coal burnt and initiated the distillation of volatile material from the ovens as they met the air supply drawn in through the top of the charging door. The dome was heated to a high temperature and assisted in carbonizing the charge by radiating its heat to the coal. The operation of the distillation and immediate combustion proceeded until the whole of the volatile matter in the coal had been evolved, which took about three days. The coke was then cooled by inserting a water sprinkler through the air hole in the door and was withdrawn manually with rakes. Almost two tonnes of coal was required to produce one tonne of coke. Using beehive coke ovens for coke production was a common practice for many years. However, advances in coke production technology meant beehive coke ovens technology was outdated by the early 1900s. Despite this, beehive coke ovens continued to be built in the Ipswich coal fields well into the mid twentieth century. There are a number of possible reasons as to why this may have been the case. The more advanced technology enabled the use of coke production by-products but was a more expensive production option. It is possible that the simpler and more economical technology of the beehive style oven was sufficient for production needs on the Ipswich fields. The material and labour shortages brought about by the Second World War may also have been another factor in choosing to remain with beehive technology, they were cheap to build, bricks could be obtained to construct them and they did not require a large labour force to work them. A third possibility is that the coal pit did not have a long enough supply of coal left in it to warrant investing in expensive coke production methods. The Klondyke Colliery was one of a number of collieries within the West Moreton Coalfield at Ipswich and was one of the longest running. Originally part of the Chuwar field, the first mine on the site, in 1871, was known as Eastwood mine after its owner, John Eastwood. The Eastwood mine was worked until 1877 and then, due to the owner's interest in other mines, laid idle for several years until it was sold to Brydon, Jones & Company in 1884, who renamed the site Mihi mine after the nearby Mihi Creek. It was at this time that the first battery of coke ovens were constructed on what would become the Klondyke Colliery site. The battery was built on the hillside above Mihi Creek and remained in use until 1891 when attention was diverted a new coal development. It was 1908 before the site was mined again, this time by Paul Francis. In 1923 Francis sold the site to a partnership of miners and a barrister who created and floated the company, Klondyke Collieries Limited. As Klondyke Collieries Limited, coke production at the site flourished. Although it is not known exactly when coke production recommenced at the site, records state in 1942 several new coke ovens were constructed at Klondyke to meet the increased demand for coke for smelting purposes. Records show in 1945 and 1946, Klondyke and Bowen in northern Queensland were the only coke producers in Queensland with Klondyke turning out approximately a sixth of Queensland's coke production. In 1948 the site changed hands again and was renamed Moreton colliery and worked until the early 1950s which was when the pit's supply was exhausted. After the closure of the site, coke production was taken over by the nearby Haighmoor site which remained in production for a further 15 years as Queensland's only cokeworks other than Bowen. The bricks used to construct the ovens are imprinted with a trademark \\"R\\" and appear to have come from the local brickworks, Rylance Colliery. Rylance Colliery was established in the 1880s and in 1931 expanded to include a brickworks. The company was sold in 1985 and is now known as Claypave. The land the ovens stand on is now owned by the Department of Natural Resources and Mines. Since production at Klondyke ceased in the early 1950s, the ovens have fallen into a state of disrepair, becoming overgrown with vegetation and subject to vandalism.  Description  View inside the coke oven, 2007 The Klondyke Coke Ovens are located at Brassall. Access is most easily gained via the corner of W.M. Hughes and Musgrave Streets, walking down the hill and then following the pathway around to the right for approximately . The path splits in two, with the left (upper) fork going to the ovens and the right (lower) fork going past the brick retaining wall. The ovens are built into the hillside above Mihi Creek and north of the nearby North Ipswich Railway Workshop area. The ovens form a large earthen covered mound of approximately in length, in width and in height. The mound is heavily covered with vegetation and leaf litter. It is difficult to identify from a distance and the ovens are not visible until in close proximity. There are twelve ovens arranged in two rows, six ovens in each row back to back. They have a domed shaped appearance. They are in diameter and in height. The ovens are constructed of brick and have individual flues. They exhibit various degrees of collapse with two ovens being completely caved in. The ovens have been subject to vandalism such as removal of bricks to form fireplaces and graffiti is evident. The rubble used to fill between the ovens is visible in some sections and consists of a combination of bricks and various sized rocks. On the downslope side, towards Mihi Creek, a brick wall of approximately in length and between in height, marks a drop from the mound containing the ovens down to a levelled area. The wall has been subjected to heavy graffiti. Brick debris, coal and coke is strewn around the site as are metal remnants of machinery such as skips, railway lines, crushing machinery, trammel screens, conveyor buckets and trolley parts. Bricks used to construct the ovens are imprinted with a large \\"R\\" in the centre of the otherwise flat, face of the brick.  Heritage listing  Klondyke Coke Ovens was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 December 2007 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Klondyke Coke Ovens are a good representation of the coke production industry in Queensland. They were one of only two collieries producing coke in Queensland during the 1940s. They are important in demonstrating the development of Queensland's coal mining industry and its role in the evolution of Queensland's history. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The relatively intact Klondyke Coke Ovens represent a process of coke manufacture in Queensland that was once common but has since been superseded by new technology and is now uncommon. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. As an industrial archaeological site and a relatively intact example of its type, the Klondyke Coke Ovens have the potential to yield information that will contribute to a greater understanding of Queensland's industrial history and will aid in comparative analysis of similar places. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Klondyke Coke Ovens are typical, in scale and type, of coking ovens that were common in the 19th century to the mid 20th century. They exhibit the principal characteristics of beehive coke ovens being dome shaped with individual flues and built in a row in a back-to-back pattern.

It is also known as Australian Fabric Manufacturers Ltd and Boral Hancock Plywood. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 19 September 2008.  History  Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company mill, circa 1920 The Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company is situated in North Ipswich on level land overlooking the Bremer River. It was established in 1875 and the factory was the first woollen manufacturing plant in Queensland. Ipswich commenced as a convict outstation known as \\"Limestone\\" in 1827. After free settlement began in 1842, the township developed as an important commercial centre because of its location at the head of navigation of the Brisbane and Bremer Rivers and at the junction of routes to the Brisbane Valley and the Darling Downs. Goods from these regions were channelled through Ipswich en route to the coast and this trade contributed significantly to Ipswich's rapid growth and prosperity. By 1875 an efficient railway had been constructed in Ipswich, increasing Ipswich's value as a commercial centre in Queensland. In 1875 The Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company established a woollen mill in Ipswich due to the existence of an efficient wool delivery system. The company bought and of land at the bend of the north bank of the Bremer River. The position of the mill was imperative to its future success; the mill was built meters from \\"The Basin\\" on the Bremer River. \\"The Basin\\" is a man-made bight in the Bremer River to allow large ships to turn around. This facilitated the loading and unloading process of shipped goods. Being situated beside the river, the mill had a reliable water source for its steam engines. The railway was also close by. The timber factory was built and production of woollen tweed commenced in 1877. To highlight the importance of the mill for Queensland at that time the factory was officially opened in 1877 by the Governor of Queensland, Sir Arthur Kennedy. Queensland's manufacturing and industrial base were expanding at this time; the woollen industry was at the forefront of this. The pastoral sector of the industry was succeeding and more and more land in Australia was opened up and utilised by sheep graziers. Larger numbers of sheep were grazing, successful breeding programs were ensuring better quality wool, and ovine diseases were being eradicated due to strict quarantine measures and improved veterinarian and environmental knowledge by farmers. The establishment of the woollen mill in Ipswich provided a centrally located processing plant for the raw wool produced on the Darling Downs. Prior to the building of the woollen mill the raw wool was sent for processing to Melbourne, Sydney or Adelaide (all of which already had well-established wool processing plants), but this was costly and inefficient. The Ipswich mill allowed raw wool to be processed locally, benefiting the Darling Downs' sheep graziers. It was also an important indicator that the Queensland economy was developing beyond the supply of raw materials, and vertical integration was occurring, in this case for the sheep industry. In an effort to encourage successful industry in Queensland, the Government offered the Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company a bonus of for the first of cloth produced. The mill initially produced only unfinished cloth, this, however, changed as a lack of demand for unfinished cloth forced the company into establishing its own clothing works. The Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company produced good quality wool products. Tweeds, flannels, worsteds, blankets, rugs, and apparel were the advertised products of the factory. In an advertisement in the Queensland Times from 1879, the directors of the company advertised the purity of their cloths, \\"they are manufactured from Queensland Merino Wool. Free from shoddy mixtures of cloths gathered from prisons, hospitals, lunatic and other asylums\\". Many woollen manufacturers in this period followed a practice known as using \\"shoddy\\". This entailed pulling apart and recycling discarded woollen products such as knitted goods which would then be woven with newly spun wool. There was a demand for this product as it was inexpensive, but The Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company did not want to be associated with such a means of woollen production, as their advertisement suggests. In 1881 additions were made to the mill. These were designed by influential Ipswich architect and businessman, Samuel Shenton, who was at the time a director of the mill - a position he held for many years (1875 to 1891). He was also Ipswich mayor for several years (1871, 1872 and 1889). It was not only Shenton who was involved with the mill, as other prominent business and political leaders in Ipswich played a large role in the direction of the mill including several Ipswich mayors. The Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company was regarded by many of the most prominent members of Ipswich as an important industry to be associated with, as well as a sound financial investment. By 1887 The Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company was mentioned in the official Tender for Public Service to the Queensland Government. An entry in the Queensland Government Gazette dated 20 January 1887, stated the supply of serge, tweed, blankets and rugs was to be supplied by The Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company at an annual fee of for the requested amount of goods. In a subsequent letter from the mill's management to the Government, it was stated the products that the Government would receive from the mill would be of a far higher quality than those that they received previously from other manufacturers. This may be a reflection on the poor quality of wool products available to many Queenslanders prior to the establishment of The Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company. In 1890, the wooden factory was replaced by spacious brick and iron buildings. These buildings were designed by eminent Ipswich architect, George Brockwell Gill. Gill designed many of the grand residences and public buildings in Ipswich from the 1880s to the 1930s. Some of his works include Ipswich Girls' Grammar School , \\"Brynhyfryd\\" for Lewis Thomas, St Paul's Rectory, Ipswich Club House, the Ipswich Technical College, and supervision of the construction of the Walter Burley Griffin Incinerator in 1936. The newly built brick factory was a very large addition to the North Ipswich landscape. In early photographs, the mill dominates The Terrace beside the Bremer River. The high west wall was built with arched, light brick \\"built-in\\" window facades that ran down the length of the side of the building to create an attractive feature in the brickwork. A tall, brick, industrial chimney rose from the south east corner of the mill. Within the tall walls, various types of industrial equipment processed the wool. The mill was designed to admit maximum possible daylight and ventilation inside the building, before the use of electric light. To do this, large panelled windows were included within the vertical segment of the sawtooth roof. Along the east, west, and south walls large windows were built in. Within the woollen mill buildings, the wool was cleaned, spun, and woven on large industrial machines into various forms of cloth. Much of this was then manufactured as garments such as shirts, trousers and suits. The unfinished fabric was also sold. These machines were steam-driven. The mill had its own steam engines and boiler for power generation. The steam engine was located beside the large brick chimney in the south-east corner of the mill. The machines were secured to great wooden supporting beams that ran below the ceiling. The wool processing within the mill consisted of various stages: sorting and grading, scouring, drying and dying, carding, combing, spinning, weaving, brushing, and sewing. Each stage was carried out in a separate area of the mill, with each process flowing onto the next in a hierarchical structure; this was a design feature to facilitate efficiency in the mill. In the two smaller south rooms the wool was sorted and graded to determine how it would be processed; the scouring vats were located in the south-west room, and here the wool was cleaned of impurities and steam dried and dyed if required. The remainder of the process was carried out in the main area of the mill. The mill contained ten carding machines; these large machines broke up the wool and removed impurities. The combing process further organised the woollen fibres. The largest machines in the mill were the spinning mules on which the wool was spun. The wool was then woven into fabrics on the weaving looms. The woven fabric then went through shaving machines to give the cloth a fine finish. Finally, the fabric would be sewn into various products. By the end of the nineteenth century, Ipswich was experiencing a boom in industry, employment, and wealth. Major manufacturing and industrial plants such as the North Ipswich Railway Workshops), coal mines, Australia's first cotton mill, and Ipswich Town Wharves were major contributors to this success. By 1891 Ipswich's population had reached 13,059, making it the fourth largest town in Queensland at that time. Whilst most industries in Ipswich provided employment opportunities for adult males, the cloth industry employed hundreds of women. The largest single employer of female labour in Ipswich was The Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company; in 1891 the firm employed 152 women of a total of 226 employees. Those living in Ipswich at this time patronised local industry; the flannel made by The Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company was a favourite cloth used by the women for making work clothes for men. The garments made within the mill were also popular with the industrial workers and miners in Ipswich. Known as \\"Ipswich Grey Flannels\\", these were woollen shirts and a standard item of dress for Ipswich men. The woollen mill held a contract with Queensland Railways for the supply of serge for their employee uniforms, as well as with the Queensland Police for the manufacture of serge uniforms. The Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company played an important role in the war effort during the First World War. Many of the industries in Ipswich suffered during the war due to reduced numbers of employees and minimised profits, but the Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company was an exception; the high number of female employees ensured minimal staff reductions caused by the war. The factory was extremely busy throughout the war making army blankets and cloth for military uniforms. By 1919, as a reflection of the success of the woollen mill in North Ipswich, it was the very first factory to have electric light installed. This meant that the mill could remain productive for longer each day, thus increasing productivity and ultimate profits, as well as benefiting the employees. 80% of the mills' products were sold in Queensland. The flannels and blankets, named Ipswich Flannel and Poinsettia Blankets, were renowned throughout Australia for their high quality. During the 1930s Depression, the woollen mill was still in production, acting as an important employer at a time of extreme unemployment throughout much of the world. A reflection of this can be seen in an advertisement in The Queensland Times from 1935 when Australia was still feeling the effects of financial recession. The advertisement claimed the Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company was tripling its output; the directors had decided to sell the garments at a lower price for the benefit of the consumer. Special lines included coat and trousers, and full suits, worsted suits, either custom made or ready-made. It was claimed the customer was purchasing \\"Pure Wool and No Rubbish\\". Statistics reveal the cloth and clothing manufacturing industry in Queensland actually increased its employment numbers over the Depression years rather than being forced to decrease them as so many other industries had to do. The Second World War saw the woollen mill playing a similar role to that of the First, making blankets and cloth for the armed services. During the war years, the Federal Government declared dismissals forbidden from vital or \\"protected industries\\" such as the cloth manufacturing industry; prices and wages were pegged. For the workers, this was a favourable climate to demand improvements. A larger number of females were employed in the mill during the war due to decreased male employment. Ipswich was an important centre for the union movement in this period, especially in the several textile mills scattered in the area. The Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company was involved in this movement. In 1942 employee displeasure brimmed over into a major worker's strike in the woollen mill. To strike in the midst of a world war that enveloped all Australia was not seen in a favourable light by the general public, and the media sentiment at the time regarding the strike at the Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company reflects this; rhetoric such as \\"War work held up\\" and \\"a most unfortunate stoppage in the supplies for the army\\" was used. The Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company continued to have industrial disputes in 1943 and 1945. Many of the windows in the building were changed in the mid-twentieth century from timber-framed sash windows to louvers. The Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company was still in production up until 1968 when the company changed hands to the Australian Fabric Manufacturers Ltd. Further construction was undertaken with modern steel- framed buildings designed for wool scouring being erected in the 1970s or early 1980s. In 1984 Hancock Bros Pty Ltd purchased the older part of the woollen mills, designating it \\"the top mill\\" and the newest parts of the mill complex were purchased first by Prunda Pty Ltd and then Terrace Furniture. The industrial machinery once used within the mill has long been removed. The factory now produces plywood and the machinery used for this production is vastly different to that once used for woollen cloth manufacture. The steam engine was removed to the North Ipswich Railway Workshops Museum (North Ipswich Railway Workshops) when the mill was taken over by the plywood company. The manager's house, once situated north-east of the site, was recently moved to the Mining Museum at Kholo for display as \\"The Queenslander\\". The mill is now manufacturing plywood for Boral Hancocks. The chimney was removed by the Boral Hancock Company as it had become unstable and unsafe.  Description  The buildings are situated above the northern bank of the Bremer River within a large industrial area that follows the river down a slight hill. Called \\"the Top Mill\\" by the current occupiers, the former buildings of The Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company are situated on the highest part of the industrial area. The mill is a large, high walled, rectangular brick building with several extensions and subsidiary buildings added, adjoining the main building. The main entrance to the mill lies to the north-west and is accessible from the corner of Lamington Parade and The Terrace. The wrought iron entrance gates display The Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company insignia. The brick wall adjacent to The Terrace has been painted and is a substantial feature in the streetscape of this small industrial area. To the left of the entrance is the main mill building. This structure is a large rectangular building constructed of light red common bricks laid in English bond. It has a sawtooth roof of sixteen sections. On the western side of the main mill building the wall is exposed and four inlaid brick features in cream brick made to resemble arched windows. Two smaller, single-story, brick extensions have been added to the west wall of the main mill, and lead into the main building internally. These buildings have corrugated iron roofs and clerestory windows. These two buildings are aligned north-south, in contrast to the rest of the factory that is east-west. There is evidence of the demolished brick chimney on the south-east corner of the mill. There is a remaining furnace at the base of the chimney; this has been bricked up and is inaccessible due to the storage of plywood surrounding it. There are concrete blocks on which machinery was mounted outside of the steam room. The brick exterior walls contain rows of large sash windows. On the eastern wall, these windows have been built approximately three meters off the ground. They now contain glass louvers. On the north and south walls, the windows are placed closer to the ground, approximately one meter from the ground; these windows were once timber framed sash windows but are now either louvers or have been bordered up by timber panels. The interior of the factory is made up of a large open area with several smaller rooms leading from it. The walls throughout are painted brick. Internally, the spaces lead into one another. The main part of the mill is a large open hall, formerly housing machinery. Timber trusses support the roof, which is unlined. In places, the timber beams have been replaced by steel. The floor is concrete. In the south- east corner room, a boiler and industrial steam engine were once housed here and were used to power the factory's machines. The large brick chimney and furnace were situated next to this boiler room in the south-east corner of the factory. The roof in this room is high to accommodate the steam power machinery. Beside this room was the wool grading room. Originally it had a timber floor, raised one meter from the existing cement floor. The room is now used as a storage room by the plywood company. Beside this room to the west was the scouring room. Initially, this room contained large cast-iron vats for the scouring process. These were sunk into the floor and were two meters in- depth, but have been floored over with cement. The factory offices still remain intact at the north-east corner of the main factory building. Within these brick offices is an original walk-in safe with original iron frame. The walls are plastered. The plastered ceiling of the first office has a small vent; this has a wrought iron cover displaying The Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company's insignia. Above all the interior doors in the office are louvered panelled windows.  Heritage listing  The former Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company mill was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 19 September 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. As the first woollen mill in Queensland, and an early example of large scale manufacturing, the mill played an important role in the development of the Queensland textile industry and is important in illustrating early vertical integration for the sheep industry in Queensland. The textile industry was traditionally a major employer of women and The Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company continued this tradition as it was the largest employer of women in Ipswich in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The mill's placement in Ipswich demonstrates the importance of Ipswich as a trading centre, receiving raw wool from the Darling Downs and passing the manufactured product on to Brisbane for distribution. As a producer of uniform fabric and blankets for the armed forces in both the First and Second World Wars, The Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company made an important contribution to Australia's war effort. It has also been important as a supplier of Railway and Police uniforms. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The practice of woollen manufacturing in major textile centres such as Northern England was to have key processes carried out in separate manufactories. The Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company is the first manufactory of its type in Queensland which processed the fibre from raw wool to textiles and garments. The Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company is rare as it was the first woollen mill in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Queensland Woollen Manufacturing Company is important as an early and substantially intact example of a woollen mill in Queensland. The mill is sitting on the bank of a river for both transport and water for steam-driven machinery, and its layout provides evidence of its operations. Within the mill are components that allow the reading of the hierarchical movement that occurred within the plant; the large steam engine room with furnace, the wool grading room, the scouring, drying and dying room, the large open halls in which the carding machines, spinning mules, weaving looms, shaving machines were once held, the sewing area and storage rooms all follow a purpose- designed floor plan that was not changed for the duration of the woollen mill's existence. The mill is an example of the work by prominent Ipswich architect George Brockwell Gill. Other notable work by Gill includes the Ipswich Girls' Grammar School, the Ipswich Technical College, the Ipswich Club House, the Hotel Metropole, and \\"Brynhyfryd\\" House. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Built on the elevated corner of a bend in the Bremer River the large brick exterior walls of the mill are a landmark in North Ipswich and have been since the brick structure was built in 1890. Due to the mill's distinctive size, setting and compositional qualities it is clearly visible from many areas around Ipswich.

Carminati was investigated for match fixing in 2012. In 2014 he was arrested with 36 others on allegations of running a corrupt network that infiltrated Rome's public administration. He was charged with fraud, money laundering, embezzlement, and the bribing of public officials. In 2017, Carminati was sentenced to 20 years in jail. Background Carminati frequented a bar that was a haunt of Rome criminals and political extremists. He became a particular friend of Valerio Fioravanti, leader of the far right terrorist group Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari (\\"Armed Revolutionary Nuclei\\", or NAR). Carminati introduced Fioravanti to some Banda della Magliana members, including their leader Franco Giuseppucci, who became a close friend of Carminati, and Massimo Sparti who later became the main witness against Fioravanti for the 1980 Bologna train station bombing. After Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari and Banda della Magliana ceased to exist through arrests and violent death, Carminati managed to emerge as a figure in his own right. =Link to Perugia trial of Andreotti= A clandestine weapons store of the Banda della Magliana was kept in the basement of a government building, it was later found to contain grenades stolen by NAR leader Valerio Fioravanti.

He is one of the key members of Mono-ha, a group of artists who became prominent in the late 1960s and 1970s. The Mono-ha artists explored the encounter between natural and industrial materials, such as stone, steel plates, glass, light bulbs, cotton, sponge, paper, wood, wire, rope, leather, oil, and water, arranging them in mostly unaltered, ephemeral states. The works focus as much on the interdependency of these various elements and the surrounding space as on the materials themselves. Career Kishio Suga was born in Morioka, Iwate Prefecture. From 1964 to 1968, he was a student in the painting department at Tama Art University in Tokyo. While at Tama, Suga read the writings of Jean Baudrillard, Gilles Deleuze, Kitar≈ç Nishida, Kei Nishitani, NƒÅgƒÅrjuna, and Vasubandhu. During this period, two artists who taught at the university were important influences on Suga. Yoshishige Saito encouraged Suga and other students to take a deconstructive approach to modernism and Euro-American-centric art theory. Another influential teacher was the artist Jiro Takamatsu, whose illusionistic paintings and sculpture were central to the development of the Tokyo art scene at that time. Suga‚Äôs early work reflected this approach. In his first solo exhibition, at Tsubaki Kindai Gallery, Tokyo, in November 1968, Suga presented Space Transformation (1968) (Ëª¢ÁßªÁ©∫Èñì), a freestanding structure of red-painted wood that gave the illusion of a stack of boxes collapsing under their own weight.Rawlings, Ashley. \\"Temporary Boundaries, Timeless Situations\\", Kishio Suga. Los Angeles: Blum & Poe, 2012, pp.6-15 At the same time as Suga was producing these illusionistic paintings and sculptures, he was already shifting to an engagement with raw materials in works such as Layered Space (1968) (Á©çÂ±§Á©∫Èñì), a transparent acrylic box containing layers of sawdust, cotton, ashes, plastic dust, and soil. In the second half of 1968, this exploration of raw materials, ephemerality and space gained recognition as a broader movement. Lee Ufan presented his first work juxtaposing rocks and steel plates.

In his ongoing investigation of \\"situation\\" and the \\"activation („Ç¢„ÇØ„ÉÜ„Ç£„Éô„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥) of existence,\\" Suga has produced many installations that are emblematic of the Mono-ha approach.

The selection of writings includes many well-known writers such as Stuart Hall and Paul Gilroy. This is an interdisciplinary collection and contains a variety of writings that discuss different forms of representation, i.e. films, music, and photography. It is centered on works of the diaspora, including Caribbean, African, and South Asian experiences. This collection is the first of its kind and critically engages with both the construction and community of \\"black Britain\\" and power relations. Every writer has something to say about their own positionality and how they've come to theorize black Britain. The book is subdivided into three main parts covering distinct time periods: 1948 to late 1960s, later 1960s to mid-1980s, and mid-1980s to late 1990s. Each main part is framed by an introduction and then divided between \\"literature\\" and \\"essays and documents\\". While many anthologies following were filled with pieces written specifically for the anthology's publication, Writing black Britain is a collection of previously published text. These pieces were initially compiled in order to prevent misinterpretation and inaccuracy about Black communities in Britain and Germany. Because of this, the anthology was aimed at speaking to mainstream white audiences in order to highlight the Black presence in European life. When reading and discussing Writing Black Britain, it is important to keep in mind the fact that it was designed for use in university coursework and the potential effect this may have had on what materials were and were not included for publication. Periodising post-war black Britain In Writing Black Britain we are reminded of the accountability we all need to share in how we tell history. This anthology contains literature that begins with 1948, an important year because of the HMT Empire Windrush. However, Writing Black Britain recognizes the genealogy of black Britain pre-1948. The introduction states, \\"an introduction to the project of this anthology requires both an account of the historical conditions in which it is embedded and a consideration of the problems and potentialities of recuperating a \\"block\\" (1948‚Äì98) of black British literary and cultural production 'anterior' to it. I will now turn to that symbolic year, 1948, as a means of grounding this Introduction.\\" This allows the collection to present a critical look at what has also been forgotten in the foregrounding of the year 1948. It serves as a reminder of the continuity within the anthology's timeline of violence against black racialized bodies. The book goes into details of violence against black racialized bodies, such as the killings that took place on the account of race. Yet, the sole presence of blacks in Britain is not the only minority discussed; there is also the discussion of South Asian, African, and Caribbean cultural production within Britain. Themes *Migration *Cultural appropriation *Racism *Policies of urban removal/renewal *Segregation *Historical amnesia *Police brutality *Solidarity *Post- colonialism *Identity politics *Survival *Representation The Caribbean Artists Movement This anthology engages with blackness and the Caribbean Community in Britain, especially looking at migration and how art serves as resistance. The Caribbean Artists Movement began in Britain, giving this discussion local relevance. In the first section, Claudia Jones speaks to the cultural identity formation of Afro-Caribbeans. Feminism within Writing Black Britain Recognizing the centrality of black women struggles within the formation of a black Britain, within this anthology black women speak to power differentials and intersectionality in their essay. As Hazel Carby states, \\"The fact that black women are subject to the 'simultaneous' oppression of patriarchy, class, and 'race' is the prime reason for not employing parallels that render their position and experience not only marginal but also invisible.\\" The Handsworth Songs Letters The anthology brings conversations to light, including the conversation/debate that occurred between Stuart Hall, Darcus Howe, and Salman Rushdie. The Black Audio Film Collective released their film Handsworth Songs (1986), and there was much to say about it and its implications. The film looks at the \\"riots\\" of 1985 in Handsworth and South London.

W. 1996. Niebla and Vermilacinia (Ramalinaceae) from California and Baja California. Sida The epithet is in reference to corrugated cortex of the species. Distinguishing Features Vermilacinia corrugata is classified in the subgenus Cylindricaria in which it is distinguished from related species by the thallus divided into tubular corrugated branches. The species is also one of two in the genus that lacks the diterpene (-)-16 Œ±-hydroxykaurane, a diagnostic character trait that easily separates the species from most others in the genus. The triterpene zeorin is usually present, while other lichen substances are rarely evident except for usnic acid, which is generally present in all species of Vermilacinia. Occasionally, no lichens substances have been detected based on thin-layer chromatography. Mature apothecia are usually present, in contrast to rarely being fully developed in V. cerebra. Vermilacinia corrugata is one of the most common fruticose lichens in Baja California, occurring along the boundary of the fog zone, in contrast to V. leopardina, a more common species found closer to the ocean, distinguished by the presence of black bands and possessing the diterpene (-)-16 Œ±-hydroxykaurane. Taxonomic History Vermilacinia corrugata was described in 1996. It had earlier been recognized to intergrade with V. leopardina, based on an older name, Desmazieria ceruchis;Rundel, P., P. A.

It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 November 2008.  History  left The Sadliers Crossing Railway Bridge, which crosses east-west over the Bremer River between Tallon Street, Sadliers Crossing and Dixon Street, Wulkuraka, is a steel truss, concrete and timber bridge designed by Chief Engineer Henry Charles Stanley. Dating from 1902, it is the second bridge to cross the Bremer River at this site. In the early 1860s the colonial Queensland Government decided to establish a railway as a means of developing the colony. It was argued that rail would reduce freight costs and save travel time for passengers considering the very poor state of Queensland roads. Priority was initially given to creating a rail link to the coast for the well-established and economically-important Darling Downs pastoral region. The river port of Ipswich was chosen as the eastern terminus of the railway. Located at the head of navigation, at the intersection of routes to the Darling Downs and Upper Brisbane Valley, it was the major inland port serving these areas. The Queensland government began its railway network when it passed a Railways Act on 3 September 1863. This 1864 Railway Act authorized construction of the section from Ipswich to the Little Liverpool Range. 3 ft 6 in narrow gauge was chosen as Queensland's uniform gauge. On 3 January 1864 tenders closed for the first section of the railway from Ipswich to Bigge's Camp. The contract was subsequently awarded to the well known British railway builders Peto, Brassey and Betts whose price of ¬£86,900 was the lowest of five tenders. Construction of this section from Ipswich, via Walloon, to Bigge's Camp (later named Grandchester) at the foot of the Little Liverpool Range commenced in February 1864 and the line was opened in July 1865. This initial route from Ipswich differed from that followed by the present railway. Ipswich station was located immediately north of the present one, and the line proceeded due north, with an immediate crossing of the Bremer River to the area now occupied by the railway workshops. It then turned west around the north bank of the river, with bridges over minor creeks such as Mihi and Ironpot creeks. The Main Line was subsequently extended to Gatton (June 1866) and Toowoomba, via ascent of the Main Range, by May 1867. The rail link from Ipswich to Grandchester remained a vital part of the Main Line but within the first decade of the operation of the line from Ipswich to Toowoomba it was decided to build a deviation near Ipswich. In 1875, the first were replaced by a new line only half its length that crossed the Bremer River west of Ipswich at Sadlier's Crossing. This deviation was part of the extension of the line from Brisbane to Ipswich that opened in October 1874. The old line was retained as far as North Ipswich to serve the locomotive and carriage sheds and workshops. Upgrading of the Main Line continued. In 1891-1892 the original 40 pound iron rails were replaced with harder wearing steel rails. Similarly all bridges on the Main Line were upgraded around the turn of the century to carry locomotives over twice the weight of the original ones. In 1899 it was decided to duplicate the rail track between Ipswich and Wulkuraka, to regrade the section between Ipswich and Rosewood and to raise the level of the Sadliers Crossing Rail Bridge so flood waters could not inundate it as happened in 1893. As a result of the disastrous 1893 floods Whipple trusses, like that used on the Sadliers Crossing Railway Bridge, were preferred for railway bridges until the introduction of through Pratt trusses. The new bridge was designed while Henry Charles Stanley was Chief Engineer for Railways (1892 to 1901). Stanley was an important early engineer in Queensland. Born and trained in Scotland, he was appointed to Queensland Railways in 1863. After working as chief engineer on several lines, Stanley became responsible for the whole of the colony's railway network in 1892. During the 1890s a number of large metal truss rail bridges were constructed to cross major streams making the connection of important towns and resources possible. In this way they were vital to the operation of the transport system and the development of the state as a whole. Many of these early bridges have since been replaced. The contract for the Sadliers Crossing Railway Bridge was awarded to J McCormick and Sons. Material and plant for the new bridge were purchased in February 1900. The timber work for the bridge was completed and the steel plate girder spans were in position in 1901. The work was completed in March 1902 and the current bridge over the Bremer River at Sadliers Crossing came into usage. Its double track operated as two single tracks, one towards Rosewood and the other for the Brisbane Valley branch line. The Sadliers Crossing Railway Bridge is a two span Whipple truss bridge with continuous rolled steel joists. It is the second longest span of its type in Queensland (), the longest being the former Burdekin River Rail Bridge at Macrossan. The Whipple truss was developed by Squire (CE) Whipple as a stronger version of the Pratt truss that was designed by Thomas and Caleb Pratt in 1844. The basic identifying features of the Pratt truss are the diagonal web members which form a V-shape. The centre section commonly has crossing diagonal members. The Pratt truss and its variations are the most common type of all trusses. One of these variations is the Whipple truss, which was patented in 1847, and is also known as the \\"Double-intersection Pratt\\" because the diagonal tension members cross two panels, while those on the Pratt cross one. The Whipple truss was popular with the railroads as it was stronger and more rigid than the Pratt. Duplication and regrading of the track between Ipswich and Grandchester began in July 1914. When completed, the two single lines were converted into double track operation between Ipswich and Wulkuraka. The bridge has not been substantially changed since its completion in 1902. In 1956 repairs were made to the bracing of No.1 truss. In 1965 plans were prepared for replacing the longitudinals supporting the track with transoms and this work was completed during the following year. In 1977 plans were prepared to replace the corbels on piers 9 and 17, and in 1994 the corner braces were removed to allow for the passage of over-height containers. The bridge was known earlier as the Red Bridge because of its paintwork and accordingly there is still evidence of red oxide paintwork to steel members of the bridge. Since the early 1960s there has been little construction of steel bridges by Queensland Rail. Once pre-stressed concrete bridge girders were proved adequate for rail use they became almost universal.  Description  Bridge in 2015 This high-level steel, concrete and timber railway bridge over the Bremer River between Tallon Street, Sadliers Crossing and Dixon Street, Wulkuraka was built between 1900 and 1902. It is located approximately from Roma Street railway station. Its total length is plus the timber trestles. It has long approaches to allow for flood flows on the Bremer River. The outer approach spans of timber longitudinals are supported by common timber trestles, both braced and unbraced. The inner approach spans are of riveted continuous rolled steel joists and riveted deck-type continuous plate girders and underslung cross girders supported on concrete piers. The two mains spans are each of . They are riveted 13-panel double-intersection through Pratt trusses (Whipple trusses) supported on concrete piers. The stylistic concrete piers are cement rendered. There are dressed stone cutwaters embedded in concrete to the upstream leading edges. A cantilevered pedestrian footbridge is attached to the upstream side of the bridge. It has wrought iron stanchions, chain wire and timber top-rail balustrades on both sides. Timber access stairs and mid-landings are attached to each end of the bridge. The rail line consists of straight double tracks.  Heritage listing  Sadliers Crossing Railway Bridge was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 November 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Sadliers Crossing Railway Bridge, opened in 1902, is important in demonstrating the evolution of the railway network in Queensland. This rail network, established in the 1860s, was vital for the development of the colony through opening land for closer settlement and freighting produce and resources to Queensland's ports. From the 1890s the preferred design of large metal rail bridges to cross major waterways underwent several changes, to withstand flooding and to meet increased load requirements. Early bridges and track on the Main Line from Brisbane to the Darling Downs, which was one of Queensland's most important lines, were upgraded to accommodate heavier, more powerful engines as freight traffic and tonnage increased from the 1890s. Sadliers Crossing Bridge, replacing an 1875 bridge, was built as part of this upgrading. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Sadliers Crossing Railway Bridge is a rare surviving example of the use of riveted double-intersection through Pratt trusses (Whipple trusses), and is the second longest span of this type in Queensland. This bridge and the former Burdekin River Rail Bridge are the only parallel chord examples of the Whipple design extant in Queensland. A variant of the Whipple truss design, using hogback trusses, is used in the Albert Bridge, Indooroopilly and the Alexandra Railway Bridge, Rockhampton. The cantilevered pedestrian footbridge and access stairs attached to the upstream spans is a rare example of its type and is still in use. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Sadliers Crossing Railway Bridge is a good example of a railway bridge designed by the Department of Railways and Public Works while Henry C Stanley was Chief Engineer of Queensland. The bridge is highly intact and provides important physical evidence of early twentieth century railway bridge design and construction in Queensland. Sadliers Crossing Railway Bridge demonstrates the evolution of the principal characteristics of steel railway bridges around the turn of the twentieth century, especially the change from the Pratt truss to the Whipple truss to the through Pratt truss, which increased the strength of the structure.

The coastline north of Parham, outside the proposed sanctuary, also has a high degree of protection through being in the Port Wakefield Proof and Experimental Establishment, and the Clinton Conservation Park. Key objectives The Adelaide International Bird Sanctuary is a protected area established by the SA government for the northeast coast of Gulf St Vincent extending from Adelaide to its immediate north with the view of achieving the five key outcomes: #Protection of habitat particularly used by shorebirds that migrate over large extents of the Earth's surface.DEWNR, 2014, page 7DEWNR, 2014, page 11 #Management of water quality in Gulf St Vincent particularly in respect to stormwater and wastewater produced in the northern suburbs of Adelaide and its treatment prior to release into Gulf St Vincent. #Creation of 'green' space 'on the fringes of the northern Adelaide Plains that will allow stormwater recycling, absorb carbon dioxide and enhance the amenity and attractiveness of the region'. #Tourism development that 'provide opportunities for developing exclusive, high-end tourism experiences with a focus on national and international birdwatchers'. #Indigenous involvement via measures to 'employ and engage Aboriginal people and use Indigenous knowledge to develop and implement environmental and cultural heritage education and interpretation programs.' A driver for the proposal is the need to rehabilitate land previously used at Dry Creek, St Kilda and other localities as salt pans and managing the environmental risks arising from the cessation of salt evaporation process of salt extract such as exposing of acid sulphate soils.DEWNR, 2014, pages 5 & 10 Extent The Adelaide International Bird Sanctuary extends from Barker Inlet in the south to Parham in the north over a distance of . Its extent overlaps and adjoins existing protected areas such as the Port Gawler and Torrens Island conservation parks, the Upper Gulf St Vincent Marine Park, the Barker Inlet-St Kilda Aquatic Reserve, the St Kilda ‚Äì Chapman Creek Aquatic Reserve and the Adelaide Dolphin Sanctuary.DEWNR, 2014, page 19 The sanctuary will also include of land that adjoins the Port Gawler Conservation Park and Buckland Park lake, which was purchased in 2013 by the SA government with financial contributions from Nature Foundation SA and Birds SA. It is stated in 2014 that the sanctuary will be proclaimed as a conservation park under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972, in order to 'provide one of the highest levels of protection allowed for by state legislation'.DEWNR, 2014, page 17 Timeline The SA government committed to the proposal at the state election held in March 2014. The 2014-15 State Budget included expenditure of A$0.3 million for the purpose of commencing work.GSA, 2014, pages 154‚Äì155 A formal announcement about the proposal was made by Ian Hunter, the Minister for Sustainability, Environment and Conservation on 20 August 2014, including the purchase of of land formerly held by salt operators, but undeveloped, for the sum of A$2 million. The SA Government has also committed to an expenditure of A$1.7 million over a period of four years for the sanctuary's establishment and its ongoing maintenance, with a likely completion in 2018. Land in the localities of Windsor, Dublin and Lower Light was proclaimed as a national park under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 on 27 October 2016 with the name Adelaide International Bird Sanctuary National Park‚ÄîWinaityinaityi Pangkara with Winaityinaityi Pangkara being the national park's name in the language of the Kaurna people, whose traditional lands include the Adelaide metropolitan area and the extent of the national park.

He is the father of Swedish curler Sara McManus. Playing career =England and Wales= McManus was born in Falkirk, Scotland but moved to the south-east of England as a child, where he represented Surrey Schools. He was an associate schoolboy with Tottenham Hotspur but failed to make the grade at White Hart Lane. In August 1983, he was studying for a Diploma in PE in Farnham, and joined Southampton on a non- contract basis. He made his debut for the reserves on 27 August 1983, scoring in each of the first two matches of the season; in his three years at The Dell he made 71 reserve team appearances, scoring 28 goals. In July 1984, he signed a professional contract and was loaned to Newport County in August and September 1985, where he played five matches without scoring. He made his first-team debut on 11 March 1986 when he replaced Danny Wallace at outside- right for the First Division match against Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road. McManus scored in the 23rd minute with a header from a deep cross from David Armstrong as the Saints recorded a 2‚Äì0 victory. He retained his place for the next match, at home to Liverpool but was substituted for Andy Townsend. McManus was released in the summer of 1986. =Scandinavia= Following his release by Southampton, McManus moved to Sweden to join √ñrgryte on a free transfer in June 1986 but very shortly joined Sandviken. The following summer, he moved to Gefle for a year, before returning to √ñrgryte in 1988, where he remained for a further three years. By 1992, he had moved to Norway and joined Lillestr√∏m for two years. He was a member of the Lillestr√∏m team that reached the final of the Norwegian Football Cup in 1992, where they were beaten 3‚Äì2 by Rosenborg. As Rosenborg also won the Norwegian Premier League title, Lillestr√∏m qualified for the 1993‚Äì94 European Cup Winners' Cup. McManus scored for Lillestr√∏m in the Qualifying Round against Estonian side Nikol Tallinn, but Lillestrom were eliminated in the First Round by Torino. After a brief time at Moss, he returned to √ñrgryte for a third spell, which lasted until 2003, when he joined Ljusne. In 2003, McManus was involved in two incidents with referees: having already been banned for five matches for assaulting a referee on 22 June, he was playing for Ljusne in August in a Fourth Division match against Delsbo. He collided with the referee, who suffered a cracked rib. McManus was charged with deliberately colliding with the referee; McManus protested his innocence and claimed that he was the victim of a \\"witch hunt\\". Before the disciplinary committee could pass judgement on the case, McManus announced his retirement from professional football. In 2010, he played a few matches as a goalkeeper for Hagastr√∂m.

Owen is most famous for voicing the role of Towser in the 1961 Disney movie One Hundred and One Dalmatians. Early life and career Owen was born on 20 January 1898 in the Welsh town of Penarth, Glamorgan. After serving with the Royal Army Medical Corps in World War I he went to RADA in London before moving to Hollywood. He began his career in the 1926 silent film Bride of the Storm as Funeral Harry. His next film role was 22 years later in the 1948 film Up in Central Park. Owen also became involved in the radio industry during the 1940s and 1950s, teaming up with producer and director Jack Webb in several radio programs. The first of those programs was the radio drama Pat Novak, for Hire. He played the role of Novak's drunk ex-doctor friend \\"Jocko\\" Madigan.Terrace, Vincent (1999). Radio Programs, 1924-1984: A Catalog of More Than 1800 Shows. McFarland & Company, Inc. . P. 266. He played this role from 1946‚Äì1949. He again co-starred with Webb in the radio series Johnny Modero, Pier 23 in 1947. Owen would co-star in a radio series with Webb just one more time. That last time was on the radio version of the Pete Kelly franchise. He played the role of Barney Rickett for the series' summer run in 1951. In 1951, he played the title character's editor in Alias Jane Doe. His last radio appearance was in 1953, leaving behind such radio credits as University Theatre, Escape, Suspense, Family Theater, Lux Radio Theatre, Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar, Crime Classics and The Lone Ranger.

Shortly after Owen's last appearance in radio, he made his first appearance in television on the TV series The Unexpected in 1953. As his presence became wanted more and more in the television field, his presence became less wanted in the film industry. Although he did find success in film it was not as much success as in previous years. His most successful film during this time was in the 1961 Disney animated cartoon One Hundred and One Dalmatians where Owen voiced the role of Towser. His last film role was a background voice role in another Disney cartoon, as a knight in The Sword in the Stone (1963). Some of his other film credits include Montana, The Black Castle, Back to God's Country, Perils of the Jungle, Brigadoon, The Oklahoma Woman, Congo Crossing and Jack the Giant Killer. Owen's television career expanded during the 1950s and 1960s which included recurring roles in Perry Mason and a starring role in a television series. From 1954‚Äì55, Owen co- starred alongside actors Thomas Mitchell and Kathleen Freeman in the sitcom Mayor of the Town. He played the role of Joe Ainsley in the series. He retired from show business after a 1965 guest appearance on the television series Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. Personal life and death Owen married Gladys Virginia Bennett Paterno in 1953, and they remained together until he died on 13 March 1979 in Los Angeles, California at the age of 81.

He was one of the key members of Mono-ha, a group of artists who became prominent in the late 1960s and 1970s. The Mono-ha artists explored the encounter between natural and industrial materials, such as stone, steel plates, glass, light bulbs, cotton, sponge, paper, wood, wire, rope, leather, oil, and water, arranging them in mostly unaltered, ephemeral states. The works focus as much on the interdependency of these various elements and the surrounding space as on the materials themselves. Career K≈çji Enokura was born in Tokyo. In 1966, he graduated from the painting department at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music. Enokura received an MFA in painting at the same university in 1968, and taught there from 1975 until his death in 1995. =Site Specific Installations= From the beginning of the 1970s, Enokura stained paper, cloth, felt, and leather with oil and grease. He also discolored the floors and walls of galleries and outdoor spaces. These installations are no longer extant but are documented in photographs. In 1970, Enokura exhibited in Tokyo Biennale ‚Äô70 ‚Äì Between Man and Matter, with Jiro Takamatsu and Susumu Koshimizu. World-renowned artists such as Richard Serra, Jannis Kounellis, Luciano Fabro, Christo and Bruce Nauman also exhibited. There he presented Place (1970), stacks of rough straw paper piled in different heights and soaked with oil.Okada, Kiyoshi. Matter and Perception 1970: Mono-ha and the Search for Fundamentals. Yomiuri Shimbun sha, 1954, p.55 One of his most notable works is Untitled (1970), a triangular structure of slashed leather placed on the floor in the corner, which highlights the relationship of the adjacent walls as much as the texture of its own surface. In a similar vein, for the Paris Youth Biennale in 1971, he constructed Wall, a three-meter-tall and five-meter-wide concrete partition between two trees in the Parc Floral. This work‚Äîfor which he was awarded a scholarship that allowed him to live in Paris from 1973 to 1974‚Äîhas been an enduring icon of his practice.thumbInstallation view at the 7th Paris Youth Biennale \\"Wall\\" 1971 Concrete-blocks, mortar Courtesy of the Estate of Koji Enokura Through interventions such as these, he sought to affirm his own place in the world. In his writings he stated, ‚ÄúIt is the tension between the body and the material that interests me, and that‚Äôs what I want to explore. It attests to the consciousness I have of my own existence.‚Äù By 1973, K≈çji Enokura, Kishio Suga, Lee Ufan, Nobuo Sekine, and other artists such as Susumu Koshimizu, and Katsuro Yoshida became collectively known as Mono-ha (literally ‚ÄúSchool of Things‚Äù). = Photographs = In addition to taking photographs that served simply to document his ephemeral installations, Enokura also took photographs that he considered to be artworks in their own right. These explored similar themes of liminal states of being, depicting pools of water on the floor or trickling off a table, or reflections of light. One of the most iconic images, Symptom: Sea‚ÄìBody (P.W. No. 40) , shows the artist lying down on the seashore, his body following the curve of the incoming tide. Of this work, curator Simon Groom wrote: = Later works on canvas = During the 1980s and 1990s, Enokura continued to explore the act of staining on cotton-fabric. In these works, which are titled Intervention or Intervention (Story) and are numbered sequentially, the artist typically contrasted smooth fields of black paint with unpainted fabric, sometimes drenching the entire surface. In several canvases he used oil-soaked beams of lumber to mark the fabric‚Äîeither affixing the beams to the work or leaning them against it.\\"Intervention No. 1\\", 1987 248.5 x 333.3 x 30 cm Cotton cloth, acrylic, wood Courtesy of the Estate of Koji Enokura and Blum & Poe Photo by Joshua WhiteSome works from this period feature shelves that support glass bottles filled with sand and water, or in one unusual case a potted plant. Enokura also created numerous works consisting of fabric in single or double layers hung diagonally on the wall and folding out onto the floor.  Exhibitions  K≈çji Enokura‚Äôs first solo exhibition was at Tsubaki Kindai Gallery, Tokyo, in 1969. Since then, he has had numerous solo shows in Japan, including the Saito Memorial Kawaguchi Museum of Contemporary Art and the National Museum of Art, Osaka, in 1994. In 2005, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo, held a major retrospective. His work has also been included in landmark surveys, such as the Tokyo Biennale ‚Äô70: Between Man and Matter, Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum, 1970; the Paris Biennale, 1971; the Biennale of Sydney, 1976; the Venice Biennale, 1978; Avanguardie Giapponese degli Anni 70, Galleria Comunale d‚ÄôArte Moderna di Bologna, 1992, and Setagaya Art Museum, Tokyo, 1993; Reconsidering Mono-ha, National Museum of Art, Osaka, 2005; and Re: Quest‚ÄïJapanese Contemporary Art since the 1970s, Museum of Art, Seoul National University, Korea, 2013. His work has received renewed attention in the United States following his inclusion in Requiem for the Sun: The Art of Mono-ha, at Blum & Poe, Los Angeles, in February 2012. This exhibition was the first survey of Mono-ha in the United States, and was followed by a solo exhibition at Blum & Poe in June 2013, which was his first solo show in the United States. The estate of K≈çji Enokura is represented by the galleries Blum & Poe (Los Angeles, New York, Tokyo), Fergus McCaffrey (New York), and Tokyo Gallery + BTAP (Tokyo, Beijing).

Life and family Miss Sophie T. LaCroix, granddaughter of John Reynolds (4th governor of Illinois), was born in Belleville, Illinois to Rene. M. LaCroix, a Canadian merchant, and his wife Mary, n√©e Hopkins, from Virginia. She had at least five siblings, including Susan (born c. 1845), Laura O. (born c. 1848, a teacher), Cornelia (born c. 1858, a store clerk), Estella (born c. 1860) and Maurice D. (born c. 1866, who worked in a printing office). LaCroix was a stockholder, proprietor and instructor of St. Louis Fancy Work Co. until her retirement in 1921. She never married and died at her home at 5726 McPherson Avenue, St. Louis, Missouri from Myocarditis, a condition she had been suffering from for a number of years. Career Librarian Gilbert Witte has catalogued LaCroix's Old and New Designs craft series, which was published by the St. Louis Fancy Work Co. in the early decades of the 20th century. First edition copies are now part of the collection of the Tennyson Library of Crochet & Related Arts, part of the University of Illinois Rare Books & Manuscripts Library. Quilt historian Barbara Brackman writes that LaCroix's 1915 book of quilt patterns Martha Washington Patchwork Quilt Book 'captured the cultural confusion American needleworkers faced' and was one of the few that 'attempted a new recipe for the American melting pot'. While LaCroix's name is credited on the book's cover, the Quilt Index, a joint project of partners including the Library of Congress American Folklife Center, attribute the quilt designs to Ann Conway, also of St. Louis, with LaCroix as editor.

Used exclusively for air ambulance missions, it serves as a base for a Eurocopter EC-135P2+ operated by Norsk Luftambulanse (NLA) on contract with the National Air Ambulance Service. The original heliport was situated at Br√∏set Hospital and opened in 1988. The base moved to Vestre Rosten in the mid 1990s. History Tr√∏ndelag was amongst the areas in Norway with the best coverage of Westland Sea King search and rescue helicopters following the establishment of the 330 Squadron at √òrland Main Air Station in 1973.Duvsete: 355 The first helicopter ambulance service in Trondheim was established by Lufttransport in February 1981. They stationed a helicopter at Trondheim Regional Hospital (today St. Olav's) in the hopes that they could sell flight hours to either the hospital or other contractors. However, no missions were requisitioned.Andersen: 158 The Ministry of Health and Social Affairs appointed a commission which in 1986 recommended that a national state-funded helicopter ambulance service be established.Ministry of Health and Social Affairs: 15 There was a major debate in Trondheim if this was a necessary investment. The previous attempt showed little use and the rescue helicopters served the region well. NLA became active in supporting an air ambulance service.Andersen: 157 Based on the commission's report, Trondheim was selected as one of eight bases starting 1 January 1988. The first base in Trondheim was situated at Br√∏set Hospital, a psychiatric hospital near Leangen. The base was rudimentary. An old stable was rebuilt as a garage and a simple plastic hangar was built for the helicopter. Norsk Luftambulanse won the contract to operate the base, originally using a Messerschmitt-B√∂lkow-Blohm Bo 105 helicopter.Ministry of Health and Social Affairs: 88 There had been calls for the base to be built at the regional hospital, but there was not place for the service there. Instead a permanent base was built at Vestre Rosten at Tiller. As part of the construction of the new St. Olav's University Hospital, a helipad was opened at the hospital on 1 February 2010. It allows direct access to the emergency department and allows for helicopters to refuel. Facilities The heliport is situated in Vestre Rosten in the Tiller neighborhood of Trondheim. The facility is owned and operated by NLA. It consists of an asphalt helipad, a hangar connected to an office building. Operations The ambulance helicopter is operated by Norsk Luftambulanse on contract with the National Air Ambulance Service. They have a Eurocopter EC-135P2+ stationed at the heliport. The helicopter has room for a crew of three, consisting of a pilot, rescue swimming and an anesthesiologist, as well as two stretchers. Medical staff are provided by St. Olav's University Hospital, part of St. Olav's Hospital Trust. The helicopter flew 893 missions lasting 726 hours in 2013.

All major American political parties support republicanism and the basic classical liberal ideals on which the country was founded in 1776, emphasizing liberty, the pursuit of happiness, the rule of law, the consent of the governed, opposition to aristocracy and fear of corruption, coupled with equal rights before the law. Political divisions inside the United States often seemed minor or trivial to Europeans, where the divide between the Left and the Right led to violent political polarization, starting with the French Revolution.Arthur Aughey, Greta Jones, W. T. M. Riches, The Conservative Political Tradition in Britain and the United States (1992), p. 1: \\"there are those who advance the thesis that American exceptionalism means...there can be no American conservatism precisely because the American Revolution created a universally liberal society.\\" No American party has advocated European ideals of conservatism such as a monarchy, an established church, or a hereditary aristocracy. American conservatism is best characterized as a reaction against utopian ideas of progress.Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan, Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics, p. 114, \\"Conservative ideas are, thus, more genuine and profound than many critics suggest, but such unity as they have is purely negative, definable only by its opposition and rejection of abstract, universal, and ideal principles...\\" Although the laissez-faire policy goals of American conservatives have never been popular,Chait, Jonathan. \\"The GOP's Age of Authoritarianism Has Only Just Begun.\\" NYMag. 30 October 2016. 22 December 2017. historian Patrick Allitt expresses the difference between conservative and liberal in terms not of policy but of attitude.Patrick Allitt, The Conservatives: Ideas and Personalities Throughout American History (Yale U.P. 2009), p. 278 Unlike Canada and the United Kingdom, there has never been a major national political party named the Conservative Party in the United States.Michael Kazin et al. eds. The Concise Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History (2011) pp 117-28. The Conservative Party of Virginia, founded in 1867, elected members to the House of Representatives from two other states (Maryland and North Carolina). Since 1962, there has been a small Conservative Party of New York State which currently has about 1% support there. During Reconstruction in the late 1860s, the former Whigs formed a Conservative Party in several Southern states, but they soon merged into the state Democratic parties.  Founding  = Colonial era = The conservatism that prevailed in the Thirteen Colonies before 1776 was of a very different character than the conservatism that emerged based on revolutionary principles. This old conservatism centered on a landed elite and on an urban merchant class that was Loyalist during the Revolution. In the largest and richest and most influential of the American colonies, Virginia, conservatives held full control of the colonial and local governments. At the local level, Church of England parishes handled many local affairs, and they in turn were controlled not by the minister, but rather by a closed circle of rich landowners who comprised the parish vestry. Ronald L. Heinemann emphasizes the ideological conservatism of Virginia, while noting there were also religious dissenters who were gaining strength by the 1760s: > The tobacco planters and farmers of Virginia adhered to the concept of a > hierarchical society that they or their ancestors had brought with them from > England. Most held to the general idea of a Great Chain of Being: at the top > were God and his heavenly host; next came kings...who were divinely > sanctioned to rule, then a hereditary aristocracy who were followed in > descending order by wealthy landed gentry, small, independent farmers, > tenant farmers, servants....Aspirations to rise above one's station in life > were considered a sin.Ronald L. Heinemann et al. Old Dominion, New > Commonwealth: A History of Virginia, 1607‚Äì2007 (2007) p. 67 In actual practice, colonial Virginia never had a bishop to represent God nor a hereditary aristocracy with titles like \\"duke\\" or \\"baron\\". However it did have a royal governor appointed by the British Crown, as well as a powerful landed gentry. The status quo was strongly reinforced by what Jefferson called \\"feudal and unnatural distinctions\\" that were vital to the maintenance of aristocracy in Virginia. He targeted laws such as entail and primogeniture by which the oldest son inherited all the land. The entail laws made land- ownership perpetual: the one who inherited the land could not sell it, but had to bequeath it to his oldest son. As a result, increasingly large plantations, worked by white tenant farmers and by black slaves, gained in size and wealth and political power in the eastern (\\"Tidewater\\") tobacco areas. Maryland and South Carolina had similar hierarchical systems, as did New York and Pennsylvania.Holly Brewer, \\"Entailing Aristocracy in Colonial Virginia: 'Ancient Feudal Restraints' and Revolutionary Reform,\\" William and Mary Quarterly (1997) 54#2 307‚Äì46 in JSTOR During the Revolutionary era, the new states repealed all such laws.

Morris, \\"Primogeniture and Entailed Estates in America,\\" Columbia Law Review, 27 (Jan. 1927), 24‚Äì51. in JSTOR The most fervent Loyalists left for Canada or Britain or other parts of the Empire. They introduced primogeniture in Upper Canada (southern Ontario) in 1792, and it lasted until 1851. Such laws lasted in England until 1926. = American Revolution = Russell Kirk saw the American Revolution itself as \\"a conservative reaction, in the English political tradition, against royal innovation\\".Russell Kirk, The Conservative Mind (1950), pp. 6, 63. David Lefer has emphasized the central role of conservative Founding Fathers in shaping the key documents such as the Constitution.David Lefer, The Founding Conservatives: How a Group of Unsung Heroes Saved the American Revolution (2013) American conservatives since the 1770s have honored the American Revolution for its successes in maintaining traditional values, such as local self-rule, that seemed under threat from London. Robert Nisbet, a leading conservative intellectual stressed the conservative nature of the American Revolution in contrast to the extreme passions and much greater violence of other revolutions, especially the French Revolution. He attributed the Patriots' restraint to the localization of power, religiosity, the absence of anticlericalism, and the relatively open class system made possible by the absence of hereditary aristocrats. After 1776, the new American conservatism, unlike European conservatism, was not based on inherited rank, landed estates or loyalty to the Crown or the established Church. Donald T. Critchlow and Nancy MacLean point out its resemblance to European liberalism. At the time of the American Revolution, the colonists under British rule lived under the freest government in the European world,Robin W. Winks, ed. The Oxford history of the British Empire: Historiography, Volume V (2001) p. 107 but in their fierce determination to protect and preserve their historic rights, the founding fathers sought independence from Great Britain despite their relatively low level of taxation.Leonard Woods Labaree, Conservatism in Early American History (1948) ch. 1‚Äì2Richard Hofstadter, America at 1750: A Social Portrait (1971) ch 5Robert E. Brown and B. Katherine Brown, Virginia 1705‚Äì1786: Democracy or Aristocracy? (1964) pp. 307‚Äì08Edward Countryman, American Revolution (1996) pp. 36‚Äì44 However, wealthy merchants involved in international trade, royal officials, and patronage holders typically enjoyed close ties across the British Empire. Most of these proud \\"Loyalists\\" opposed the American Revolution and remained loyal to the Crown throughout the war. In a sense, the Loyalists represented a trans-Atlantic loyalty to a society that was far more hierarchical. Their leaders loved order, respected their betters, looked down on their inferiors, and feared \\"mobocracy\\" at home more than rule by a distant monarch. When it came to a choice between protecting their historic rights as Americans or remaining loyal to the King, they chose King and Empire. About one in five Loyalists (70,000 or so) Loyalists left the new United States by 1783. Most went to Canada where they are still known as United Empire Loyalists.Norman Risjord, Jefferson's America, 1760‚Äì1815 (2002) p. 129Bernard Bailyn, The Ordeal of Thomas Hutchinson: Loyalism and the Destruction of the First British Empire (1974) The patriots who fought in the Revolution did so in the name of preserving traditional rights of Englishmen‚Äîespecially the right of \\"no taxation without representation\\"; they increasingly opposed attempts by Parliament to tax and control the fast- growing colonies. In 1773, when the British imposed heavy sanctions on the Massachusetts colony in the wake of the Boston Tea Party, self described patriots organized colony-by-colony resistance through organizations such as the Sons of Liberty.David F. Burg, A World History of Tax Rebellions: An Encyclopedia of Tax Rebels, Revolts, and Riots from Antiquity to the Present (Routledge, 2003) p. 253 Fighting broke out in the spring of 1775, and all Thirteen Colonies entered into open rebellion against the crown. In July 1776, the Second Continental Congress declared independence from the United Kingdom and became the de facto national government espousing the principles of Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. The patriots formed a consensus around the ideas of republicanism, whereby popular sovereignty was invested in a national legislature instead of a King. Historian Leonard Labaree identified the main characteristics of the Loyalists that contributed to their conservative opposition to independence. Loyalists were generally older than Patriots, better established in society, resisted innovation, believed resistance to the Crown‚Äîthe legitimate government‚Äîwas morally wrong, and were further alienated from the Patriot cause when it resorted to violent means of opposition, such as burning houses and tarring and feathering royal officials. Loyalists wanted to take a middle-of-the road position and were angry when forced by the Patriots to declare their opposition. They had a long-standing sentimental attachment to Britain (often with business and family ties) and were procrastinators who realized that while independence might be inevitable, they would rather postpone it for as long as possible. Many loyalists were also highly cautious and afraid of the potential anarchy or tyranny that could arise out of mob rule. Finally, Loyalists were pessimists who lacked the Patriots' confidence in the future of an independent United States.Labaree, Conservatism pp. 164‚Äì65See also N. E. H. Hull, Peter C. Hoffer and Steven L. Allen, \\"Choosing Sides: A Quantitative Study of the Personality Determinants of Loyalist and Revolutionary Political Affiliation in New York,\\" Journal of American History, vol. 65, no. 2 (Sep. 1978), pp. 344‚Äì66 in JSTOREdwin G. Burrows and Michael Wallace, \\"The American Revolution: The Ideology and Psychology of National Liberation,\\" Perspectives in American History, (1972) vol. 6, pp. 167‚Äì306 The Patriots' victory established their revolutionary principles as core American political values adhered to by all parties in the newly formed United States. Modern American Conservatives often identify with the Patriots of the 1770s, a fact exemplified in 2009 by the Tea Party movement, named after the Tea Party of 1773. Its members often dress in costumes characteristic of the Founding Fathers. The American Revolution proved highly disruptive to the old networks of conservative elites in the colonies. The departure of so many royal officials, rich merchants, and landed gentry destroyed the hierarchical networks that previously dominated politics and power in many of the colonies. In New York, for example, the departure of key members of the DeLancy, DePester Walton, and Cruger families undercut the interlocking families that largely owned and controlled the Hudson Valley. Likewise in Pennsylvania, the departure of the powerful Penn, Allen, Chew, and Shippen families destroyed the cohesion of the old upper class. New men became rich merchants, but they retained a spirit of republican equality that replaced the old elitism; the revolution prevented the rise of a truly powerful upper class in American society. Most Loyalists remained in the new nation and became loyal citizens, although they seldom held leadership positions of the sort they were entitled to before the Revolution. = Federalists = In the wake of the Revolution, the newly formed Federalist Party, dominated by Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, used the presidency of George Washington to promote a strong nation capable of holding its own in world affairs, with a strong army and navy able to suppress internal revolts (such as the Whiskey Rebellion), and a national bank to support financial and business interests.Patrick Allitt, The Conservatives (2009) pp. 6‚Äì26 Intellectually, Federalists, while devoted to liberty, held profoundly conservative views attuned to the American character. As Samuel Eliot Morison explained, they believed that liberty is inseparable from union, that men are essentially unequal, that vox populi [voice of the people] is seldom if ever vox Dei [the voice of God], and that sinister outside influences were busy undermining American integrity.Samuel Eliot Morison, Harrison Gray Otis, 1765‚Äì1848: the urbane Federalist (2nd ed. 1969) pp. x‚Äìxi Historian Patrick Allitt concludes that Federalists promoted many conservative positions, including the rule of law under the Constitution, republican government, peaceful change through elections, judicial supremacy, stable national finances, credible and active diplomacy, and protection of wealth.Patrick Allitt, The Conservatives (2009) p. 26 The Federalists were dominated by businessmen and merchants in the major cities and were supportive of the modernizing, urbanizing, financial policies of Hamilton. These policies included the funding of the national debt and also assumption of state debts incurred during the Revolutionary War (thus allowing the states to lower their own taxes and still pay their debts), the incorporation of a national Bank of the United States, the support of manufactures and industrial development, and the use of a tariff to fund the Treasury. In foreign affairs the Federalists opposed the French Revolution. Under John Adams they fought the \\"Quasi War\\" (an undeclared naval war) with France in 1798‚Äì99 and built a strong army and navy. Ideologically, the controversy between Jeffersonian Republicans and Federalists stemmed from a difference of principle and style. In terms of style the Federalists distrusted the public, thought the elite should be in charge, and favored national power over state power. Republicans distrusted Britain, bankers, merchants, and did not want a powerful national government. The Federalists‚Äînotably Hamilton, were distrustful of \\"the people\\", the French, and the Republicans.Chernow (2004)  John Adams  Since the 1790s, conservatives have emphasized an identification with the Founding Fathers and the Constitution. Historians of conservative political thought \\"generally label John Adams as the intellectual father of American conservatism.\\"Edmund Burke is typically seen as his English counterpart. Randall B. Ripley, ‚ÄúAdams, Burke, and Eighteenth-Century Conservatism.‚Äù Political Science Quarterly (1965). 80#2: 216‚Äì235. online Russell Kirk points to Adams as the key Founding Father for conservatives, noting that \\"some writers regard him as America's most important conservative public man.\\"Russell Kirk, \\"Adams, John\\" in John Frohnen, ed., American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia (2006) p 11 Historian Clinton Rossiter writes: > Here was no lover of government by plutocracy, no dreamer of an America > filled with factions and hard-packed cities. Here was a man who loved > America as it was and had been, one whose life was a doughty testament to > the trials and glories of ordered liberty. Here ... was the model of the > American conservative.Clinton Rossiter, Conservatism in America (1955) p 114 Historian A. Owen Aldridge places Adams, \\"At the head of the conservative ranks in the early years of the Republic and Jefferson as the leader of the contrary liberal current.\\"A. Owen Aldridge, \\"John Adams: Pioneer American Conservative.\\" Modern Age (2002) 44#3 pp 217-25. It was a fundamental doctrine for Adams that all men are subject to equal laws of morality. He held that in society all men have a right to equal laws and equal treatment from the government. However, he added, \\"no two men are perfectly equal in person, property, understanding, activity, and virtue.\\"Aldridge, p 224 Peter Viereck concluded: > Hamilton, Adams, and their Federalist party sought to establish in the new > world what they called a \\"natural aristocracy.\\" [It was to be] based on > property, education, family status, and sense of ethical > responsibility....Their motive was liberty itself. = Democratic-Republicans = In the 1790s, Jeffersonian democracy arose in opposition to the Federalist Party, primarily as a response to the fear that Federalists' favoritism toward British monarchism threatened the new republic.Noble E. Cunningham, The Jeffersonian Republicans: The Formation of Party Organization, 1789‚Äì1801 (1957) The opposition party chose the name \\"Republican Party\\". Some historians refer to them as \\"Jeffersonian Republicans\\" while political scientists usually use the \\"Democratic-Republican Party,\\" in order to distinguish them from the modern Republican Party. While \\"Jeffersonian Democracy\\" persisted as an element of the Democratic Party into the early 20th century, as exemplified by William Jennings Bryan (1860‚Äì1925), and its themes continue to echo in the 21st century.Jeff Taylor, Where Did the Party Go?: William Jennings Bryan, Hubert Humphrey, and the Jeffersonian Legacy (2006) Jeffersonians opposed the further strengthening federal government and the rise of an interventionist judiciary, a concern later shared by conservatives of the 20th century.Joyce Appleby, Thomas Jefferson (Times Books, 2003) ch. 7 The next four presidents were Democratic- Republicans. = Whigs = Daniel Webster, a prominent Whig leader During the 1800s and 1810s, the \\"Old Republicans\\" (not to be confused with the Republican Party, which did not yet exist) were led by John Randolph of Roanoke. They refused to form a coalition with the Federalists. Instead they set up a separate opposition led by James Madison, Albert Gallatin, James Monroe, John C. CalhounCalhoun at this stage was a leader of the nationalists. He later turned 180 degrees. and Henry Clay. They nevertheless adopted Federalist principles by chartering the Second Bank of the United States, promoting internal improvements for transportation, raising tariffs to protect factories, and promoting a strong army and navy after the failures of the War of 1812.See Norman K. Risjord, The Old Republicans: Southern conservatism in the age of Jefferson (1965) By the 1830s, the Whig Party emerged as the national conservative party. Whigs supported the national bank, private business interests, and the modernization of the economy in opposition to Jacksonian democracy, which represented the interests of poor farmers and the urban working class, represented by the newly formed Democratic Party. They chose the name \\"Whig\\" because it had been used by patriots in the Revolution. Daniel Webster and other Whig leaders referred to their new political party as the \\"conservative party\\", and they called for a return to tradition, restraint, hierarchy, and moderation.Allitt, The Conservatives: Ideas and Personalities (2009), p. 65 In the end, the nation synthesized the two positions, Federalist and Whig, adopting representative democracy and a strong nation state. By the end of the 1820s, American politics had generally adapted to a two-party system whereby rival parties stake their claims before the electorate, and the winner takes control of the government. As time went on, the Federalists lost appeal with the average voter and were generally not equal to the tasks of party organization; hence, they grew steadily weaker. After 1816, the Federalists had no national influence apart from John Marshall's Supreme Court. They retained some local support into the 1820s, but important leaders left their fading cause, including future presidents John Quincy Adams and James Buchanan, and future Chief Justice Roger B. Taney.  John C. Calhoun  John C. Calhoun of South Carolina (1782-1850), at various times a Jeffersonian Republican, a Whig and a Democrat, was always an independent thinker. He moved from a strong nationalist position in the 1810s and 1820s, to a states' rights position emphasizing the rights of minorities (by which he meant white South), and rejecting a powerful central government. Jefferson and Madison in 1798 had developed a theory of nullification that would enable states to reject unconstitutional federal actions. Calhoun picked up the idea and further developed it as a defense against federal attacks on slavery. His ideas were enormously influential among southern politicians and intellectuals in the decade after his death in 1850; his ideas were often used to promote secession in 1860 as a legal, constitutional escape valve for the South.Patrick Allitt, The Conservatives: Ideas and Personalities Throughout American History (2009) pp 32-36. Brian Farmer says, \\"Perhaps no figure better exemplifies the attitudes of Southern conservatism in the antebellum period than John C. Calhoun of South Carolina.\\" His ideas were revived by hard-core Southern conservatives in the 20th century. According to Peter Viereck, \\"this more extreme, very regional Calhoun conservatism still dominates much of the American South in the 1970s.\\"  American Civil War  = Abraham Lincoln = Abraham Lincoln was the first president elected by the newly formed Republican Party, and Lincoln has been an iconic figure for American conservatives. Historian David Hackett Fischer stresses Lincoln's conservative views. In the 1850s, \\"Lincoln was a prosperous corporate lawyer, and a member of the conservative Whig party for many years.\\" He promoted business interests, especially banks, canals, railroads, and factories.Boritt, Lincoln and the Economics of the American Dream (1994) Before the outbreak of the Civil War, Lincoln explicitly appealed to conservatives. In 1859, he explained what he meant by conservatism in terms of fealty to the original intent of the Founding Fathers: > The chief and real purpose of the Republican party is eminently > conservative. It proposes nothing save and except to restore this government > to its original tone in regard to this element of slavery, and there to > maintain it, looking for no further change in reference to it than that > which the original framers of the Government themselves expected and looked > forward to.\\"Abraham Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln: Speeches and Writings > 1859‚Äì1865 (Library of America, 1989) p. 35 online Lincoln elaborated his position in his famous Cooper Union speech before Republican elites in New York on February 27, 1860. He argued that the Founding Fathers expected slavery to die a natural death, not to spread. His point was that the Founding Fathers were anti-slavery and the notion that slavery was good was a radical innovation that violated American ideals. This speech solidified Lincoln's base in the Republican Party and helped assure his nomination.Harold Holzer, Lincoln at Cooper Union: The Speech That Made Abraham Lincoln President (2006) pp. 134, 139, 144, 212, 306 During the war, Lincoln was the leader of the moderate Republicans who fought the Radical Republicans on the issues of dealing with slavery and re-integrating the South into the nation. He built the stronger coalition, holding together conservative and moderate Republicans, and War Democrats, against the Radicals who wanted to deny him renomination in 1864.T. Harry Williams, Lincoln and the Radicals (1972)Gabor S. Boritt, Lincoln and the Economics of the American Dream (1994) pp. 238, 257 When the war was ending Lincoln planned to reintegrate the white South into the union as soon as possible by offering generous peace terms, \\"with malice toward none, with charity toward all\\". But when Lincoln was assassinated, the Radicals gained the upper hand and imposed much harsher terms than those Lincoln had wished.William C. Harris, With Charity for All: Lincoln and the Restoration of the Union (1998) James Randall is one of many who see Lincoln as holding 19th century classical liberal positions, while at the same time emphasizing Lincoln's tolerance and conservatism \\"in his preference for orderly progress, his distrust of dangerous agitation, and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform.\\" Randall concluded that Lincoln was \\"conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called 'radicalism' which involved abuse of the South, hatred for the slaveholder, thirst for vengeance, partisan plotting, and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders.\\"Randall, Lincoln the Liberal Statesman (1947) p. 175. In: The enduring Lincoln: Lincoln sesquicentennial lectures at the University of Illinois. University of Illinois Press, 1959, David Greenstone argues that Lincoln's thought was grounded in reform liberalism but notes his unionism and Whiggish politics had a deeply conservative side as well.J. David Greenstone, The Lincoln Persuasion: Remaking American Liberalism Princeton University Press, 1994. 26, 276‚Äì85. Some liberal historians hold alternative views. According to Striner, \\"...it is vain to try to classify Lincoln as a clear-cut conservative or liberal, as some historians have tried. He was both, and his politics engendered a long-term tradition of centrism...\\" . = Southern conservatism = After the Civil War, \\"conservative\\" came to mean those who supported the steady integration of blacks into American society, but opposed the Radical Republicans who wanted to impose punitive measures against ex- Confederates.Patrick Allitt, The Conservatives: Ideas and Personalities, p. 67 Conservative Southerners thought that the radical conservatism by Northern reformers to empower the freed slaves would cause upheaval if done too quickly. They often accused northern Carpetbaggers who tried to help freed slaves of corruption. Conservatives opposed the race-based politics in the American South, but given the dominance of the Democratic party, had to settle on incrementalism. Supremacist Democrats differed from conservatives in their strong support for white supremacy, and insistence on a second-class powerless status for blacks, regardless of the Constitution.Dewey W. Grantham, The Life and Death of the Solid South: A Political History (1992) Southern conservatives in the 1950s added anti-communism to their agenda, believing that the ideology was poisoning the civil rights movement and the push for integration.Jeff Woods, Black struggle, red scare: segregation and anti- communism in the South LSU Press, 2004. There was also a liberal element in the South‚Äîin support of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt‚Äîbut they rarely opposed Jim Crow.George B. Tindall, The emergence of the new South, 1913‚Äì1945 pp. 216‚Äì17, 425, 632‚Äì37, 718 From 1877 to 1960, the \\"Solid South\\" voted for Democratic Party candidates in almost all national elections; Democrats had firm control of state and local government in all southern states. By the late 1930s conservative Southern Democrats in Congress joined with most Northern Republicans in an informal Conservative Coalition that usually proved decisive in stopping progressive New Deal domestic legislation until 1964. With the Southern strategy of the Republican party in the late 1960s, religious southern conservatives shifted their support from the Democratic party to the Republican party, forming a very dominant solid south block of social conservatives in the Republican party. However the Southerners generally were much more internationalist than the mostly isolationist Northern Republicans in the Coalition.Alfred O. Hero Jr., The southerner and world affairs (1965) Fundamentalism, especially on the part of Southern Baptists, was a powerful force in Southern conservative politics beginning in the late 1970s. However, they voted for Reagan in 1980 over a fellow Southern Baptist Jimmy Carter.Earl Black and Merle Black, The Rise of Southern Republicans (2003)Oran P. Smith, The Rise of Baptist Republicanism (2000)  Gilded Age  There was little nostalgia and backward looking in the dynamic North and West during the Gilded Age, the period in the U.S. history in the late 19th century, from the 1870s to about 1900. Business was expanding rapidly, with manufacturing, mining, railroads, and banking leading the way. There were millions of new farms in the prairie states. Immigration reached record levels. Progress was the watchword of the day. The wealth of the period is highlighted by American upper class opulence, but also by the rise of American philanthropy (referred to by Andrew Carnegie as the \\"Gospel of Wealth\\") that used private money to endow thousands of colleges, hospitals, museums, academies, schools, opera houses, public libraries, symphony orchestras, and charities.Allitt, The Conservatives: Ideas and Personalities (2009), ch. 5 Conservatives in the 20th Century, looking back at the Gilded Age, retroactively applied the word \\"conservative\\" to those who supported unrestrained Capitalism. For example, Oswald Garrison Villard, writing in 1939, characterized his former mentor Horace White (1834‚Äì1916) as \\"a great economic conservative; had he lived to see the days of the New Deal financing he would probably have cried out loud and promptly demised.\\"quoted in: David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito, \\"Gold Democrats and the Decline of Classical Liberalism, 1896‚Äì1900, p. 559\\" Independent Review 4 (Spring 2000), 555‚Äì75 online In this sense, the conservative element of the Democratic party was led by the Bourbon Democrats and their hero President Grover Cleveland, who fought against high tariffs and on behalf of the gold standard. In 1896, the Bourbons were overthrown inside the Democratic Party by William Jennings Bryan and the agrarians, who preached \\"Free Silver\\" and opposition to the power that banks and railroads had over the American farmer. The agrarians formed a coalition with the Populists and vehemently denounced the politics of big business, especially in the decisive 1896 election, won by Republican William McKinley, who was easily reelected over Bryan in 1900 as well. Religious conservatives of this period sponsored a large and flourishing media network, especially based on magazines, many with close ties to the Protestant churches that were rapidly expanding due to the Third Great Awakening. Catholics had few magazines but opposed agrarianism in politics and established hundreds of schools and colleges to promote their conservative religious and social values.Ronald Lora, ed. The Conservative Press in Eighteenth-and Nineteenth-Century America (1999) part 4 and 5. Modern conservatives often point to William Graham Sumner (1840‚Äì1910), a leading public intellectual of the era, as one of their own, citing his articulate support for free markets, anti-imperialism, and the gold standard, and his opposition to what he saw as threats to the middle class from the rich plutocrats above or the agrarians and ignorant masses below.Robert Green McCloskey, American conservatism in the age of enterprise, 1865‚Äì1910: a study of William Graham Sumner, Stephen J. Field, and Andrew Carnegie (1964)Late in life Sumner wrote an essay focused on the dangers of monopoly. His unpublished essay of 1909, \\"On the Concentration of Wealth\\" shows his concern that pervasive corporate monopoly could be a grave threat to social equality and democratic government. Bruce Curtis, \\"William Graham Sumner 'On the Concentration of Wealth,'\\" Journal of American History 1969 55(4): 823‚Äì32. The Gilded Age came to an end with the Panic of 1893 and the severe nationwide depression that lasted from 1893 to 1897.  1896‚Äì1932  = 1896 realignment = The two parties re-aligned in the election of 1896, with the conservative Republicans led by William McKinley becoming the party of business, sound money and assertive foreign policy while the Democratic Party, led by William Jennings Bryan, became the party of the worker, the small farmer, free silver inflationists, populists and anti-imperialism in 1900. Bryan's people took control of the Democratic Party away from the Cleveland Democrats (also called \\"Bourbon Democrats\\") at the 1896 convention, where 36-year old Bryan electrified the left by blaming international bankers in New York, London and elsewhere for crucifying mankind upon \\"a cross of gold.\\" Pietistic Protestants thrilled to Bryan's intensely religious rhetoric. The Republican strategy for a counter crusade was \\"to join together all conservative forces and brand the crusaders as anarchists, dishonest shallow-brained fools, and thoroughly dangerous fanatics....While Bryan preached the overthrow of evil men, the opposition showed that silver right panaceas would wreck the economy for decades, deprived factory workers of their livelihood, cheat honest businessmen, and install a holy un-American regime.\\" The Republican counter- crusade energized conservative Republican farmers and businessmen, and attracted previously Democratic-inclined Lutherans and Catholics, who switched toward McKinley as the sound money conservative choice who rejected radicalism. The term socialist has long been used as an epithet by conservatives that goes far beyond issues of municipal ownership. Editor William Allen White of Emporia, Kansas, in his famous 1896 editorial on \\"What's the matter with Kansas\\" furiously attacked the radicalism of Bryanite Democrats and Populists. Supporters of Republican conservative William McKinley distributed over a million copies to rally opposition to William Jennings Bryan, nominee of both the Democratic and Populist parties. White, according to historian David Hinshaw, used \\"socialistic\\" as \\"his big gun to blast radical opposition.\\"David Hinshaw, A Man from Kansas: The Story of William Allen White (1945) pp 107-8. = Conservative empire building = As the 19th century drew to a close, the United States became an imperial power, with overseas territories in Hawaii, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico, and control over Cuba. Imperialism won out, as the election of 1900 ratified McKinley's policies and the U.S. possession of Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Philippines and (temporarily) Cuba. Theodore Roosevelt promoted the military and naval advantages of the U.S., and echoed McKinley's theme that America had a duty to civilize and modernize the heathen.Frank Nincovich, \\"Theodore Roosevelt: Civilization as Ideology,\\" Diplomatic History (summer 1986) 10:222‚Äì30Kenton J. Clymer, John Hay: The Gentleman as Diplomat (1975) Bryan made anti-imperialism a centerpiece of his 1900 campaign, and the Democrats continue the anti-imperialistic tradition, calling for independence for the Philippines until they finally won congressional approval in 1916 that Promised eventual independence, which was achieved in 1946. Meanwhile, the imperialistic Republicans lost interest. The supposed business, religious, and military advantages of having an empire proved illusory; by 1908 or so the most ardent conservative imperialists, especially William Howard Taft, and Elihu Root turned their attention to building up an army and navy at home and to building the Panama Canal.Richard Leopold, Elihu Root and the Conservative Tradition (1954) They dropped the notion of additional expansion and agreed by 1920 that the Philippines should become independent.Frederick W. Marks III, Velvet on Iron: The Diplomacy of Theodore Roosevelt (1979)Walter LaFeber, The Cambridge History of American Foreign Relations: The American Search for Opportunity, 1865‚Äì1913, vol. 2 (1995) = Progressive Era = In the early years of the 20th century, Republican spokesmen for big business in Congress included Speaker of the House Joe Cannon and Senate Republican Leader Nelson Aldrich of Rhode Island. Aldrich introduced the Sixteenth Amendment, which allowed the federal government to collect an income tax; he also set in motion the design of the Federal Reserve System, which began in 1913.Elmus Wicker, Great Debate On Banking Reform: Nelson Aldrich and the Origins of the Fed (2005) Pro-business conservatives supported many Progressive Era reforms, especially those opposed to corruption and inefficiency in government, and called for purification of politics. Conservative Senator John Sherman sponsored the nation's basic anti-trust law in 1890, and conservatives generally supported anti-trust in the name of opposing monopoly and opening up opportunities for small business.William Letwin, Law and Economic Policy in America: The Evolution of the Sherman Antitrust Act (1965) The Efficiency Movement attracted many Progressive Republicans, such as Nelson W. Aldrich and later President Herbert Hoover; with its pro-business, quasi-engineering approach to solve social and economic problems. The issues of prohibition and woman suffrage split the conservatives. The \\"insurgents\\" were on the Left of the Republican Party. Led by Robert M. La Follette of Wisconsin, George W. Norris of Nebraska, and Hiram Johnson of California, they fought the conservatives in a series of bitter battles that split the GOP and allowed the Democratic Party to take control of Congress in 1910. Teddy Roosevelt, a hawk on foreign and military policy, moved increasingly to the Left on domestic issues regarding courts, unions, railroads, big business, labor unions and the welfare state.George W. Ruiz, \\"The Ideological Convergence of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson,\\" Presidential Studies Quarterly, Mar 1989, 19#1 pp. 159‚Äì77.William Henry Harbaugh, Power and Responsibility: The Life and Times of Theodore Roosevelt (1975) By 1910‚Äì11, Roosevelt had broken bitterly with Taft and the conservative wing of the GOP. In 1911‚Äì12 he took control of the insurgency on the left, formed a third party, and ran an unsuccessful campaign for president on the Progressive Party ticket in 1912. His departure left the conservatives, led by President William Howard Taft, dominant in the Republican party until 1936.William Schambra, \\"The Election of 1912 and the Origins of Constitutional Conservatism.\\" in Toward an American Conservatism (Palgrave Macmillan, 2013). 95-119.Norman M. Wilensky, Conservatives in the Progressive era: The Taft Republicans of 1912 (1965) The split opened the way in 1912 for Democrat Woodrow Wilson to become president with only 42% of the vote. The result was that liberalism prevailed for 8 years.David Sarasohn, The Party of Reform: Democrats in the Progressive Era (UP of Mississippi, 1989) pp 155‚Äì238. = World War I = The Great War broke out in 1914, with Wilson proclaiming neutrality. Former President Theodore Roosevelt denounced Wilson's foreign policy, charging, 'Had it not been for Wilson's pusillanimity, the war would have been over by the summer of 1916.\\" Indeed, Roosevelt believed that Wilson's approach to foreign policy was fundamentally and objectively evil.H. W. Brands, T.R.: The Last Romantic (1997) p. 753 Roosevelt abandoned the Progressive Party and campaigned energetically for Republican candidate Charles Hughes, but Wilson's policy of neutrality managed to provide him with a narrow victory in the 1916 election. The GOP, under conservative leadership, went on to regain Congress in 1918Seward W. Livermore, Politics is Adjourned Woodrow Wilson and the War Congress, 1916‚Äì1918 (1966) and then the White House in 1920. = 1920s = thumbtime=3 Republicans returned to dominance in 1920 with the election of President Warren G. Harding, who ran a campaign that pledged a return to normalcy. Tucker (2010) argues that the 1924 election marked the \\"high tide of American conservatism,\\" as both major candidates campaigned for limited government, reduced taxes, and less regulation. The opposition was split between Progressive party candidate Robert La Follette who won 17% of the vote, and Democratic John W. Davis who took 29% which allowed Calvin Coolidge to easily win reelection.Garland S. Tucker III, The High Tide of American Conservatism: Davis, Coolidge and the 1924 Election (2010) Under Coolidge (1923‚Äì29), the economy boomed and society stabilized; new policies focused on Americanizing immigrants already living in the United States and restricting the influx of new immigrants into the country. During 1920s, religious fundamentalists like minister William Bell Riley and William Jennings Bryan, the three-time Democratic presidential nominee, led the battle against the theory of Darwinian Evolution. They considered it false and blasphemous and helped pass laws to make the teaching of evolution in public schools a state crime. The Scopes Trial of 1925 was a nationally publicized challenge to their efforts which largely discredited the movement.Jeffrey P. Morgan, ed., The Scopes Trial: A brief history with documents (Bedford/St. Martin's, 2002). Representative of the 1900‚Äì1930 era, was James M. Beck, a lawyer under Presidents Roosevelt, Harding and Coolidge, and a congressman from 1927‚Äì1933. He espoused conservative principles such as nationalism, individualism, constitutionalism, laissez-faire economics, property rights, and opposition to reform. Conservatives like Beck saw the need to regulate bad behavior in the corporate world with the intention of protecting corporate capitalism from radical forces, but they were alarmed by the anti-business and pro-union proposals of Roosevelt after 1905. They began to question the notion of a national authority beneficial to big capital, and instead emphasized legalism, concern for the Constitution, and reverence for the American past.Morton Keller, In Defense of Yesterday: James M. Beck and the Politics of Conservatism, 1861‚Äì1936 (1958) = Anti-Communism = In the wake of the Bolshevik Revolution and the subsequent rise of the USSR, both major American political parties became strongly anti-Communist. Within the U.S., the far Left split and an American Communist Party emerged in the 1920s.Dorothy Healey and Maurice Isserman, Dorothy Healey Remembers: A Life in the American Communist Party, Oxford University Press, 1990, Conservatives denounced Communist ideals as a subversion of American values and maintained relentless opposition to Communist principles until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Conservatives were especially sensitive to the perception of Communist elements trying to change national policies and values in the U.S. government, the media, and academia. Conservatives enthusiastically supported anti- Communist agencies such as the FBI, were chief proponents of the Congressional investigations of the 1940s and 1950s, particularly those led by Richard Nixon and Joe McCarthy, and were wary of ex-Communists who exposed the system, such as Whittaker Chambers.Richard Gid Powers, Not Without Honor: The History of American Anticommunism (1996) = Writers and intellectuals = A tension between mainstream academia and conservatism has been a factor for generations. Richard Hofstadter found that opposition to conservatism has been common among intellectuals since about 1890.Richard Hofstadter, Anti- Intellectualism in American Life (1966) p. 407 Although conservatism built a presence among intellectuals in the late 19th century, historian George Nash wrote in 1996 that, \\"Despite its new-found status and competitiveness, intellectual conservatism remains a minority movement, especially in the academic community, and, more broadly, amongst the articulate and politically dynamic \\"new class\\".George Nash, The conservative intellectual movement in America, since 1945 (2nd ed. 1996) p. x However, there were conservative intellectuals inside and out of mainstream academia who during the early and mid-20th century propagated conservative values and shaped the intellectual base of modern conservatism. Prominent among them were Irving Babbitt, Russell Kirk, Henry Adams, Richard M. Weaver, Whittaker Chambers etc. A classic conservative work of the period is Democracy and Leadership (1924) by Irving Babbitt. Numerous literary figures developed a conservative sensibility and warned of threats to Western Civilization. In the 1900‚Äì1950 era Henry Adams, T. S. Eliot, Allen Tate, Andrew Lytle, Donald Davidson, and others feared that heedless scientific innovation would unleash forces that would undermine traditional Western values and lead to the collapse of civilization. Instead they searched for a rationale for promoting traditional cultural values in the face of their fear of an onslaught by moral nihilism based on historical and scientific relativism.David A. Hallman, \\"The Southern Voice in the Conservative Complaint of Modernist Literature,\\" Continuity, 1984, Issue 9, pp. 169‚Äì85 Conservatism as an intellectual movement in the South after 1930 was represented by writers such as Flannery O'Connor and the Southern Agrarians. The focus was on traditionalism and hierarchy.Joseph M. Flora, Lucinda Hardwick MacKethan, and Todd W. Taylor, The Companion to Southern Literature: Themes, Genres, Places, People, Movements, and Motifs (2001) Numerous former Communist or Trotskyite writers repudiated the Left in the 1930s or 1940s and embraced conservatism, becoming contributors to National Review in the 1950s. They included Max Eastman (1883‚Äì1969), John Dos Passos (1896‚Äì1970), Whittaker Chambers (1901‚Äì1961), Will Herberg (1901‚Äì1977), and James Burnham (1905‚Äì1987).See John P. Diggins, Up from Communism: Conservative Odysseys in American Intellectual History (1976) Dozens of small circulation magazines aimed at intellectuals promoted the conservative cause in the 20th century.For a detailed analysis of 65 of these magazines see Ronald Lora, The Conservative Press in Twentieth-Century America (Greenwood Press, 1999) = Newspapers = Major newspapers in metropolitan centers with conservative editorial viewpoints have played an important part in the development of American conservatism. In the 1930‚Äì1960 era, the Hearst chain,William Randolph Hearst supported Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932 for president, but broke decisively in late 1933.

Gerston and Terry Christensen, California Politics and Government (2008) p. 40 By 1936, most publishers favored Republican Alf Landon over Democratic liberal Franklin Roosevelt. In the nation's 15 largest cities the newspapers that editorially endorsed Landon represented 70 percent of the circulation, while Roosevelt won 69% of the actual voters in those 15 cities.Charles W. Smith Jr.. Public Opinion in a Democracy (1939), pp. 85‚Äì86. Roosevelt's secret was to open up a new channel of communication to his supporters, through radio. His Fireside Chats especially influenced young radio broadcaster Ronald Reagan, who was an enthusiastic New Dealer at that time.Douglas B. Craig, Fireside Politics: Radio and Political Culture in the United States, 1920‚Äì1940 (2005) p. 163 Newspaper publishers continue to favor conservative Republicans.A study of 1,500 newspapers in 1976, 1980, and 1984 showed they supported Gerald Ford and Reagan 80% of the time.

Hansen, \\"Presidential Endorsement Patterns by Chain-Owned Papers, 1976‚Äì84,\\" Journalism Quarterly, Summer 1990, Vol. 67 Issue 2, pp. 286‚Äì94 The Wall Street Journal has continuously been a major voice of conservatism since the 1930s, and remains so since its takeover by Rupert Murdoch in 2007. As editor of the editorial page, Vermont C. Royster (1958‚Äì1971), and Robert L. Bartley (1972‚Äì2000), were especially influential in providing a conservative interpretation of the news on a daily basis.Richard Vetter, \\"Wall Street Journal,\\" in Frohnen, ed. American Conservatism pp. 898‚Äì99  New Deal Era  During the 1930s, the seeds of modern conservatism was born with the opposition towards the New Deal of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Conservative (mostly Midwestern) Republicans and Southern Democrats united for the first time, and distinct characteristics of modern conservatism began to appear. The Great Depression which followed the 1929 stock market collapse led to price deflation, massive unemployment, falling farm incomes, investment losses, bank failures, business bankruptcies and reduced government revenues. Herbert Hoover's protectionist economic policies failed to halt the depression, and in the 1932 presidential election, Democratic Franklin D. Roosevelt won a landslide victory. = Liberty League and the Old Right = Roosevelt's New Deal had considerable conservative support at the start, but by 1934 the conservatives started uniting in opposition to the president. The counterattack first came from conservative Democrats, led by presidential nominees John W. Davis (1924) and Al Smith (1928), who mobilized businessmen into the American Liberty League.Frederick Rudolph, \\"The American Liberty League, 1934‚Äì1940.\\" The American Historical Review (1950): 19‚Äì33. in JSTOR; and online Opposition to the New Deal also came from the Old Right, a group of conservative free-market anti-interventionists, originally associated with Midwestern Republicans led by Hoover and, after 1938, by Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio. Ex-President Hoover moved sharply to the Right after 1932, abandoning his earlier Progressivism. He became a leading opponent of FDR and the New Deal. Hoover became a senior statesman of \\"conservative republicanism\\" until his death in 1964, and made his research center the Hoover Institution a major think tank for the right.Richard Norton Smith, An Uncommon Man: The Triumph of Herbert Hoover (1987). The Old Right accused Roosevelt of promoting socialism; some noted his upper class status and said he was a \\"traitor to his class\\".H. W. Brands, Traitor to His Class: The Privileged Life and Radical Presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (2008) By 1935, the New Deal strongly supported labor unions, which grew rapidly in membership and power; they became the main target of conservatives.Jefferson Cowie, and Nick Salvatore, \\"The Long Exception: Rethinking the Place of the New Deal in American History,\\" International Labor & Working-Class History, (2008) 74:3‚Äì32. = Conservative backlash against Franklin D. Roosevelt = Buoyed by his landslide win in 1936, which decimated the GOP in Congress, Roosevelt in early 1937 astonished the nation by his \\"court-packing scheme\\", announcing his plan to add six more justices to the nine on the Supreme Court who had been overturning New Deal legislations as unconstitutional. Vice President John Nance Garner worked with congressional allies to stop Roosevelt. Many who broke with Roosevelt on the Court issue had been old Progressives such as Senator Burton K. Wheeler of Montana and Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, who played a backstage role.Johnson, Marc C. \\"Franklin D. Roosevelt, Burton K. Wheeler, and the Great Debate A Montana Senator'S Crusade for Non-Intervention before World War II.\\" Montana-The Magazine Of Western History (2012) 62#4 pp. 3‚Äì46.James F. Simon, FDR and Chief Justice Hughes: The President, the Supreme Court, and the Epic Battle over the New Deal (2012) Roosevelt was defeated in the Court initiative and fought back by targeting his enemies in the 1938 Democratic primaries. The national economy was in a sharp recession, and widespread labor strikes were making unions highly controversial. Roosevelt failed as all but one Congressman resisted the \\"purge\\". Opposition to Roosevelt doubled among Southern Democratic Congressmen.Susan Dunn, Roosevelt's Purge: How FDR Fought to Change the Democratic Party (2012) excerpt and text searchCharles M. Price, and Joseph Boskin. \\"The Roosevelt 'Purge': A Reappraisal.\\" Journal of Politics (1966) 28#3 pp. 660‚Äì70. in JSTORSean J.

The Conservative Coalition generally controlled Congress until 1963; no major legislation passed which the Coalition opposed. Its most prominent leaders were Senator Robert A. Taft (R-OH) and Senator Richard Russell (D-GA).James T. Patterson, Mr. Republican: A Biography of Robert A. Taft (1972).Gilbert C. Fite, Richard B. Russell, Jr., Senator from Georgia (2002). online According to James T. Patterson: > By and large the congressional conservatives by 1939 agreed in opposing the > spread of federal power and bureaucracy, in denouncing deficit spending, in > criticizing industrial labor unions, and in excoriating most welfare > programs. They sought to \\"conserve\\" an America which they believed to have > existed before 1933. = Foreign policy = Charles Lindbergh speaking at an America First Committee rally The conservative coalition was not concerned with foreign policy as most of the Southern Democrats were internationalists, a position opposed by most Republicans. The key Republican conservative was Senator Taft. He unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination in 1940, 1948, and 1952, and was a staunch isolationist who opposed American membership in NATO (1949) and the fight against Communism in the Korean War (1950). Many conservatives, especially in the Midwest, in 1939‚Äì41 favored isolationism and opposed American entry into World War II‚Äîand so did some liberals. (see America First Committee). Conservatives in the East and South were generally interventionist, as typified by Henry Stimson. However, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in Dec. 1941 united all Americans behind the war effort, with conservatives in Congress taking the opportunity to close down many New Deal agencies, such as the b√™te noire WPA.  Thomas Jefferson's image  Thomas Jefferson has been a major hero to both left and right, although at different times for different reasons. In the New Deal era of the 1930s, Jefferson's memory became contested ground. Franklin D. Roosevelt greatly admired Jefferson and had the Jefferson Memorial built to honor his hero. Even more dramatic was the reaction of the conservatives as typified by the American Liberty League (comprising mostly conservative Democrats who resembled the Bourbon Democrats of the 1870‚Äì1900 era) and the Republican Party. Conservative Republicans abandoned their Hamiltonian views because they led to enlarged national government. Their opposition to Roosevelt's New Deal was cast in explicitly Jeffersonian small-government terms, and Jefferson became a hero of the Right.Merrill D. Peterson, The Jefferson image in the American mind (1960) pp. 355‚Äì79  1945‚Äì1951  The modern conservative political movement, combining elements from both traditional conservatism and libertarianism, emerged following World War II, but had its immediate political roots in reaction to the New Deal. Those two branches of conservatism allied the post World War I anti-communism thought. They defended a system in which the state should have a limited role to play in individual affairs.Schoenwald, Jonathan M. Time for Choosing : The Rise of Modern American Conservatism .Oxford University Press, 2001, p.19. Their conceptions of conservatism, though differing slightly from one another, shared an inclination towards the elevation of a universal moral code within society. In the early 1950s, Dr. Russell Kirk defined the boundaries and resting grounds of conservatism. In his book, \\"The Conservative Mind\\", Dr. Kirk wrote six \\"truisms\\"Schoenwald, Jonathan M. Time for Choosing : The Rise of Modern American Conservatism.Oxford University Press, 2001, p.19 that became major concepts for conservatism philosophy. Another important name in the domain of U.S conservatism is James Burnham. Mr. Burnham, philosopher in training but remembered for his political life, unsettled some foundations of conservatism when he, fervent opponent of liberalism, took position in favor of the Conscription.Schoenwald, Jonathan M. Time for Choosing : The Rise of Modern American Conservatism.Oxford University Press, 2001, p.24. In another book called Rebels All, the authors sought to define the main goals of Post-War conservatism in the United States. They wrote: \\"isn't conservatism supposed to be about maintaining standards, upholding civility, and frowning on rebellion?\\"Mattson, Kevin; Erickson, Steven K...Rebels All!: A Short History of the Conservative Mind in Postwar America.Rutgers University Press, 2008. p. 3. In addition, looking back at how it has evolved from after World War II to modern times, it seems undeniable that conservatism holds the capacity to defend diverging beliefs such as free-market libertarianism, religious traditionalism while valuing the aggressively suggested by the anti-communist mind.Mattson, Kevin; Erickson, Steven K...Rebels All! : A Short History of the Conservative Mind in Postwar America.Rutgers University Press, 2008. p. 11 Modern Conservatism, a highly complex concept, finds its roots in the works of post-World War II thinkers and philosophers whose differing opinions about how to promote similar goals reflect the subjectivity of this political inclination. In 1946, conservative Republicans took control of Congress and opened investigations into communist infiltration of the federal government under Roosevelt. Congressman Richard Nixon accused Alger Hiss, a senior State Department official, of being a Soviet spy. Based on the testimony of Whittaker Chambers, an ex-Communist who became a leading anti-Communist and hero to conservatives, Hiss was convicted of perjury.William McGurn, \\"The Witness of Whittaker Chambers: A Bitter Hope,\\" Modern Age, Spring/Summer 1984, Vol. 28 Issue 2/3, pp. 203‚Äì07 President Harry Truman (1945‚Äì1953) adopted a containment strategy against Joseph Stalin's Communist expansion in Europe. Truman's major policy initiatives were through the Truman Doctrine (1947), the Marshall Plan (1948) and NATO (1949). Truman's Cold War policies had the support of most conservatives except for the remaining isolationists. The far left (comprising Communist Party members and fellow travelers) wanted to continue d√©tente with Russia, and followed FDR's vice president Henry Wallace in a quixotic crusade in 1948 that failed to win broad support and, indeed, largely destroyed the far left in the Democratic party.Robert A. Divine, \\"The Cold War and the Election of 1948,\\" Journal of American History, June 1972, Vol. 59 Issue 1, pp. 90‚Äì110 in JSTOR Truman was reelected but his vaunted \\"Fair Deal\\" went nowhere, as the Conservative Coalition set the domestic agenda in Congress. The Coalition did not play a role in foreign affairs. In 1947, the conservative coalition in Congress passed the Taft‚ÄìHartley Act, balancing the rights of management and unions, and delegitimizing Communist union leaders. However, the major job of rooting out communists from labor unions and the Democratic party was undertaken by liberals, such as Walter Reuther of the autoworkers unionMartin Halpern, \\"Taft-Hartley and the Defeat of the Progressive Alternative in the United Auto Workers,\\" Labor History, Spring 1986, Vol. 27 Issue 2, pp. 204‚Äì26 and Ronald Reagan of the Screen Actors Guild (Reagan was a Democrat at that time).Lou Cannon, President Reagan: the role of a lifetime (2000) p. 245 One typical mid-century conservative Republican in Congress was Noah M. Mason (1882‚Äì1965), who represented a rural downstate district in Illinois from 1937 to 1962. Less flamboyant and less well known than his colleague Everett McKinley Dirksen, he ardently supported states' rights in order to minimize the federal role, for he feared federal regulation of business. He distrusted Roosevelt, and gave many speeches against high federal spending. He called out New Dealers, such as Eveline M. Burns, Henry A. Wallace, Adolph A. Berle, Jr., and Paul A. Porter, as socialists, and suggested their policies resembled fascism. He fought communism as a member of the House Un-American Activities Committee (1938‚Äì43), and in 1950 he championed Joe McCarthy's expos√©s.Jack A. Samosky, \\"Congressman Noah Morgan Mason: Illinois' Conservative Spokesman\\", Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society, March 1983, Vol. 76 Issue 1, pp. 35‚Äì48 In 1950, Lionel Trilling wrote that conservatives had lost the battle of ideas: \\"In the United States at this time liberalism is not only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition. For it is the plain fact that nowadays there are no conservative or reactionary ideas in general circulation.\\" He likewise wrote: \\"But the conservative impulse and the reactionary impulse do not, with some isolated and some ecclesiastical exceptions, express themselves in ideas but only in action or in irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas.\\"Lionel Trilling (1950), The Liberal Imagination, 1953 reprint, Garden City, NY: Anchor Books, Preface, p. 5. = Korean War = When the communist North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950 Truman adopted a rollback strategy, planning to free the entire country by force. Truman decided not to obtain Congressional approval for his war‚Äîhe relied on UN approval‚Äîwhich left the Republicans free to attack his war policies. Taft said Truman's decision was \\"a complete usurpation by the president.\\"Most analysts agreed that war without Congressional approval was a \\"costly mistake.\\" Robert J. Donovan, Tumultuous Years: The Presidency of Harry S. Truman, 1949‚Äì1953 (1982), ch 23; Taft quote on p. 220 Truman's reliance on the UN reinforced conservative distrust of that body. With the Allies on the verge of victory, the Chinese communists entered the war and drove the Allies back with terrific fighting in sub-zero weather. Truman reversed positions, dropped the rollback policy, and fired the conservative hero General Douglas MacArthur (who wanted rollback), and settled for containment. Truman's acceptance of the status quo at a cost of 37,000 Americans killed and undermined Truman's base of support. Truman did poorly in the early 1952 primaries and was forced to drop his reelection bid. The Democratic Party nominated a liberal intellectual with no ties to Roosevelt or Truman, Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson II. = McCarthyism: 1950‚Äì1954 = A 1947 booklet published by the Catholic Catechetical Guild Educational Society raising the specter of a Communist takeover When anxiety over Communism in Korea and China reached a fever pitch, an otherwise obscure Senator, Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin, launched extremely high-visibility investigations into the alleged network of communist spies in the government. Irish Catholics (including Buckley and the Kennedy Family) were intensely anti-communist and supported McCarthy (a fellow Irish Catholic).William F. Buckley and L. Brent Bozell, Mccarthy and His Enemies: The Record and Its Meaning (1954) Paterfamilias Joseph Kennedy (1888‚Äì1969), a leading conservative Democrat, was an ardent supporter of McCarthy, and got his son Robert F. Kennedy a job with McCarthy. McCarthy's careless tactics, however, allowed his opponents to effectively counterattack. McCarthy talked of \\"twenty years of treason\\" (i.e. since Roosevelt's election in 1932). In 1953, he started talking of \\"21 years of treason\\" and launched a major attack on the Army for promoting a communist dentist in the medical corps; this was too much for Eisenhower, who encouraged Republicans to censure McCarthy formally in 1954. The Senator's power collapsed overnight. Senator John F. Kennedy did not vote for censure.Oshinsky [1983] (2005), pp. 33, 490;Michael O'Brien, John F. Kennedy: A Biography (2005), pp. 250‚Äì54, 274‚Äì79, 396‚Äì400;Reeves (1982), pp. 442‚Äì43;Thomas Maier, The Kennedys: America's Emerald Kings (2003), pp. 270‚Äì80;Crosby, God, Church, and Flag, pp. 138‚Äì60. Arthur Herman states that \\"McCarthy was always a more important figure to American liberals than to conservatives\\", because he defined the liberal target, and made liberals look like innocent victims.Arthur Herman, Joseph McCarthy: Reexamining the Life and Legacy of America's Most Hated Senator (1999) p. 324 However, in recent years conservatives have not so much defended McCarthy's rough tactics as argued, chiefly based on espionage work done under the Venona project, that communist spies were really present in the government, and some of the Left at the time were indeed covering up those communist networks.Roger Chapman, ed. Culture wars: an encyclopedia of issues, viewpoints, and voices (2010), Volume 1, p. 112  1950s  Examining postwar conservative intellectual history, Kim Phillips-Fein writes: > The most influential synthesis of the subject remains George H.

Nash, > The Conservative Intellectual Tradition since 1945 (1976) As shown by General Dwight D. Eisenhower's defeat of Senator Robert A. Taft for the GOP nomination in 1952, isolationism had weakened the Old Right. Eisenhower then won the 1952 election by crusading against what he called Truman's failures: \\"Korea, Communism and Corruption.\\" Eisenhower quickly ended the Korean War, which most conservatives by then opposed; and adopted a conservative fiscal policy while cooperating with Taft, who became the Senate Majority Leader. As President, Eisenhower promoted \\"Modern Republicanism,\\" involving limited government, balanced budgets, and curbing government spending. Although taking a firm anti-Communist position, he and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles didn't push for rollback and continued the Truman administration's policy of containment. He cut defense spending by shifting the national strategy from reliance on expensive army divisions to cheap nuclear weapons. Although he made efforts to eliminate expensive supports for farm prices, he was ultimately unsuccessful, but he met success in reducing the role of the federal government by returning offshore oil reserves to the states. Eisenhower kept the regulatory and welfare policies of the New Deal, with the Republicans taking credit for the expansion of Social Security. He also sought to minimize conflict among economic and racial groups in the quest for social harmony, peace and prosperity. He was reelected by a landslide in 1956.James Patterson, Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945‚Äì1974 (1997) pp. 271‚Äì73David W. Reinhard, Republican Right since 1945 (1983) p. 110 = Russell Kirk = While Republicans in Washington were making small reversals of the New Deal, the most critical opposition to liberalism came from conservative intellectuals. Russell Kirk (1918‚Äì1994) claimed that both classical and modern liberalism placed too much emphasis on economic issues and failed to address man's spiritual nature, and called for a plan of action for a conservative political movement. He claimed that conservative leaders should appeal to farmers, small towns, the churches, and others, following the example of the British Conservative Party.Russell Kirk, The Conservative Mind (1950), pp. 423‚Äì24. Kirk adamantly opposed libertarian ideas, which he saw as a threat to true conservatism. In Libertarians: the Chirping Sectaries Kirk wrote that the only thing libertarians and conservatives have in common is a detestation of collectivism. \\"What else do conservatives and libertarians profess in common? The answer to that question is simple: nothing. Nor will they ever have.\\".Russell Kirk, Libertarians: the Chirping Sectaries in The Essential Russell Kirk, ISI Books, 2007, = William F. Buckley Jr. and the National Review = William F. Buckley Jr. The most effective organizer and proponent of conservative ideas was William F. Buckley, Jr. (1925‚Äì2008), the founder of National Review in 1955 and a highly visible writer and media personality. Although before, there had been numerous small right-wing circulation magazines, the National Review was able to gain national attention and shaped the conservative movement due to strong editing and a strong stable of regular contributors. Erudite, witty and tireless, Buckley inspired a new enthusiasm for the movement.John B. Judis, William F. Buckley, Jr.: Patron Saint of the Conservatives (1990) full-scale biography by liberal journalist. Behind the scenes the magazine was handled by publisher William A. Rusher Geoffrey Kabaservice asserts, \\"in many ways it was Rusher, not Buckley who was the founding father of the conservative movement as it currently exists. We have Rusher, not Buckley, to thank for the populist, operationally sophisticated, and occasionally extremist elements that characterize the contemporary movement.\\"Geoffrey Kabaservice, \\"The Syndicate,\\" The New Republic August 27, 2012 Buckley and Rusher assembled an eclectic group of writers: traditionalists, Catholic intellectuals, libertarians and ex-Communists. They included: Russell Kirk, James Burnham, Frank Meyer, Willmoore Kendall, L. Brent Bozell, and Whittaker Chambers In the magazine's founding statement Buckley wrote:Our Mission Statement, National Review Online, November 19, 1955. > The launching of a conservative weekly journal of opinion in a country > widely assumed to be a bastion of conservatism at first glance looks like a > work of supererogation, rather like publishing a royalist weekly within the > walls of Buckingham Palace. It is not that of course; if National Review is > superfluous, it is so for very different reasons: It stands athwart history, > yelling Stop, at a time when no other is inclined to do so, or to have much > patience with those who so urge it. = Milton Friedman and libertarian economics = Austrian economist F. A. Hayek (1899‚Äì1992) in 1944 galvanized opponents of the New Deal by arguing that the left in Britain was leading that nation down the \\"road to serfdom\\".Bruce J. Caldwell, Hayek's Challenge: An Intellectual Biography of F.A. Hayek (2005) p. 297 More influential was the Chicago school of economics, led by Milton Friedman (1912‚Äì2006) and George J. Stigler (1911‚Äì1991), who advocated neoclassical and monetarist public policy. The Chicago School provided a vigorous criticism of regulation, on the grounds that it led to control of the regulations by the regulated industries themselves. Since 1974, government regulation of industry and banking has greatly decreased.Martha Derthick and Paul J. Quirk, The Politics of Deregulation (1985) The School attacked Keynesian economics, then the dominant theory of economics, which Friedman claimed was based on unsound models. The \\"stagflation\\" of the 1970s (combining high inflation and high unemployment) was impossible according to Keynesian models, but was predicted by Friedman, giving his approach credibility among the experts.Johan van Overtveldt, The Chicago School: How the University of Chicago assembled the Thinkers Who Revolutionized Economics and Business (2007) p. 85 By the late 1960s, Alan O. Ebenstein argues that Friedman was \\"the most prominent conservative public intellectual at least in the United States and probably in the world.\\"Alan O. Ebenstein, Milton Friedman: A Biography (2009) p. 181 Friedman advocated for greater reliance on the marketplace in lectures, weekly columns, books, and on television. According to Friedman, Americans should be \\"Free to Choose\\". He convinced many conservatives that the practice of military drafting was inefficient and unfair; consequently, Nixon ended it in 1973. Nine Chicago School economists won the Nobel prize for economics. Their views about deregulation and fiscal policy became widely accepted, following the crisis in the 1970s. However, Friedman's \\"monetarism\\" did not fare as well, with current monetary practice targeting inflation, not the money supply.Patrick Minford, ed. Money matters (2004) p. 125 As an academic economist, Ben Bernanke developed Friedman's argument that the banking crises of the early 1930s deepened and prolonged the depression.Ross B. Emmett, Elgar Companion to the Chicago School of Economics (2010) p. 95 As Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Bernanke's energetic reaction to the great financial crisis of 2008 was based in part on Friedman's warnings about the Fed's inactions after 1929. = John Birch Society = Robert W. Welch Jr. (1900‚Äì1985) founded the John Birch Society as an authoritarian top- down force to combat Communism. It had tens of thousands of members and distributed books, pamphlets and the magazine American Opinion. It was so tightly controlled by Welch that its effectiveness was strictly limited, as it mostly focused on calls to impeach Chief Justice Earl Warren, as well as supporting local police.Schoenwald, (2001) pp. 83‚Äì91. Some chapters without Welch's approval did organize opposition to fluoridation of local water supplies or pushed a slate for election to local school boards. It became a major lightning rod for liberal attacks. In 1962, Buckley won the support of Goldwater and other leading conservatives for an attack on Welch. He denounced Welch and the John Birch Society in National Review, as \\"far removed from common sense\\" and urged the GOP to purge itself of Welch's influence.William F. Buckley, Jr., \\"Goldwater, the John Birch Society, and Me\\". Commentary (March 2008) online = Internal disagreements = The main disagreement between Kirk, who would become described as a traditionalist conservative and the libertarians was whether tradition and virtue or liberty should be their primary concern. Frank Meyer tried to resolve the dispute with fusionism which argued that the United States could not conserve its traditions without economic freedom. He also noted that they were united in opposition to \\"big government\\" and made anti-communism the glue that would unite them. The term \\"conservative\\" was used to describe the views of National Review supporters, despite initial protests from the libertarians, because the term \\"liberal\\" had become associated with \\"New Deal\\" supporters. They were also later known as the \\"New Right\\", as opposed to the New Left.  1960s  = South and segregation = Despite the popular perception that conservatism is limited to Republicans, during the era of segregation before 1965 some Southern Democrats were also conservative, opposing the segregationists in their party. Southern Democrats were a key part of a Conservative Coalition that largely blocked New Deal labor legislation in Congress from 1937 to 1963, though they tended to be liberal and vote with the rest of the Democratic Party on other economic issues. Southern Democrats fended off the more conservative Republican Party (GOP) by arguing that only they could defend segregation because the Republican Party nationally was committed to integration. That argument collapsed when Congress banned segregation in 1964. This provided an opportunity for Republicans to appeal to conservative Southerners on the basis that the GOP was the more conservative party on a wide range of social and economic issues, as well as being hawkish on foreign policy when the antiwar forces gained strength in the Democratic party. Southern conservatives moved from the Democratic Party to the GOP at the presidential level in the 1960s, and at the state and local level after 1990.Patrick Allitt, The Conservatives: Ideas and Personalities Throughout American History, p. \\"before the 1950s there was no such thing as a conservative movement in the United States.\\", Yale University Press, 2009, Kirk, Russell.

Goldwater published The Conscience of a Conservative (1960), a bestselling book that explained modern conservative theory. Goldwater was significantly weakened by his unpopular views regarding social security, income tax, and the war in Vietnam. In Tennessee, he suggested selling the Tennessee Valley Authority, which was a favorite for conservatives in its region.William D. Brooks, \\"A field study of the Johnson and Goldwater campaign speeches in Pittsburgh.\\" The Southern Speech Journal (1967) 32#4 pp. 273‚Äì81. He voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964, thereby winning the support of Southern segregationists. Support for the campaign came from numerous grassroots activists, such as Phyllis Schlafly and the newly formed Young Americans for Freedom, sponsored by Buckley to mobilize conservatives. Buckley himself tried to win the 1965 mayoral election of New York, but failed. Despite Goldwater's defeat conservatives were rapidly organizing at the local, state, and national levels. They were most successful in suburban California, where they worked hard in 1966 for their new hero Ronald Reagan (1911‚Äì2004), who was elected governor for two terms.Gerard J. De Groot, \\"'A Goddamned Electable Person': The 1966 California Gubernatorial Campaign of Ronald Reagan.\\" History 82#267 (1997) pp. 429‚Äì48.Totton J. Anderson and Eugene C.

Schulman and Julian E. Zelizer, eds. Rightward bound: Making America conservative in the 1970s (Harvard UP, 2008) pp 1-10.Andrew Busch, Regan's victory: the presidential election of 1980 and the rise of the right (UP of Kansas, 2005). The common thread was a growing distrust of government to do the right thing on behalf of the people. While distrust of high officials had been an American characteristic for two centuries, this was brought to the forefront by the Watergate scandal of 1973-1974 that forced the resignation of President Richard Nixon, who faced impeachment, as well as criminal trials for many of his senior associates. The media was energized in its vigorous search for scandals, which deeply impacted both major parties at the national, state and local levels.J. Lull, and S. Hinerman, \\"The search for scandal' in J. Lull & S. Hinerman, eds. Media scandals: Morality and desire in the popular culture marketplace (1997) pp. 1-33. At the same time there was a growing distrust of long-powerful institutions such as big business and labor unions. The postwar consensus regarding the value of technology in solving national problems, especially nuclear power, came under heavy attack from the New Left.Timothy E. Cook and Paul Gronke. \\"The skeptical American: Revisiting the meanings of trust in government and confidence in institutions.\\" Journal of Politics 67.3 (2005): 784-803. Conservatives at the state and local levels increasingly emphasized the argument that the soaring crime rates indicated a failure of liberal policy in the American cities.James O. Finckenauer, \\"Crime as a national political issue: 1964-76: From law and order to domestic tranquility.\\" NPPA Journal 24.1 (1978): 13-27. Abstract Meanwhile, liberalism was facing divisive issues, as the New Left challenged established liberals on such issues as the Vietnam War, while building a constituency on campuses and among younger voters. A \\"cultural war\\" was emerging as a triangular battle among conservatives, liberals, and the New Left, involving such issues as individual freedom, divorce, sexuality, and even topics such as hair length and musical taste.James Davison Hunter, Culture wars: The struggle to control the family, art, education, law, and politics in America (1992). The triumphal issue for liberalism was the achievement of civil rights legislation in the 1960s, which won over the black population and created a new black electorate in the South. However, it alienated many working-class ethnic whites, and opened the door for conservative white Southerners to move into the Republican Party.Jack M. Boom, Class, race, and the civil rights movement (1987). In foreign policy, The war in Vietnam was a highly divisive issue in the 1970s. Nixon had introduced a policy of d√©tente in the Cold War, but it was strongly challenged by Reagan and the conservative movement. Reagan saw the Soviet Union as an implacable enemy that had to be defeated, not compromised with. A new element emerged in Iran, with the overthrow of a pro-American government, and the emergence of the stream the hostile ayatollahs. Radical students seized the American Embassy, and held American diplomats hostage for over a year, underscoring the weaknesses of the foreign policy of Jimmy Carter.David Farber, Taken hostage: The Iran hostage crisis and America's first encounter with radical Islam (Princeton UP, 2009). The economic scene was in doldrums, with soaring inflation undercutting the savings pattern of millions of Americans, while unemployment remained high and growth was low. Shortages of gasoline at the local pump made the energy crisis a local reality.W. Carl Biven, Jimmy Carter's economy: policy in an age of limits (U of North Carolina Press, 2003). online Reagan increasingly dominated the conservative movement, especially in his failed 1976 quest for the Republican presidential nomination and his successful run in 1980.Rick Perlstein, The Invisible Bridge: The Fall of Nixon and the Rise of Reagan (2014) excerpt covers 1973‚Äì76 = Religious Right = An unexpected new factor was the emergence of the religious right as a cohesive political force that gave strong support to conservatism.Paul Boyer, \\"The Evangelical Resurgence in 1970s American Protestantism\\" in Bruce J.

With no apologies (1979) Ronald Reagan frequently emphasized Judeo-Christian values as necessary ingredients in the fight against communism.John Kenneth White, Still seeing red: how the Cold War shapes the new American politics (1998) p. 138 Belief in the superiority of Western Judeo-Christian traditions led conservatives to downplay the aspirations of Third World and to denigrate the value of foreign aid.Lisa McGirr, Suburban Warriors: The Origins of the New American Right (2002) p. 173 Since the 1990s, the term \\"Judeo-Christian\\" has been primarily used by conservatives.Douglas Hartmann, et al., \\"One (Multicultural) Nation Under God? Changing Uses and Meanings of the Term \\"Judeo-Christian\\" in the American Media,\\" Journal of Media & Religion, 2005, Vol. 4 Issue 4, pp. 207‚Äì34 Evangelicals had been politicized in the 1920s, battling to impose prohibition and to stop the teaching of evolution in the schools (as in the Scopes Trial of 1925), but had largely been politically quiet since the 1930s.Axel R. Schafer, Countercultural Conservatives: American Evangelicalism From the Postwar Revival to the New Christian Right (University of Wisconsin Press; 2011). The emergence of the \\"religious right\\" as a political force and part of the conservative coalition dates from the 1970s and was a response to secularization and Supreme Court rulings on school prayer and abortion. According to Wilcox and Robinson, \\"The Christian Right is an attempt to restore Judeo-Christian values to a country that is in deep moral decline.... [They] believe that society suffers from the lack of a firm basis of Judeo- Christian values and they seek to write laws that embody those values\\".Clyde Wilcox and Carin Robinson, Onward Christian Soldiers?: The Religious Right in American Politics (2010) p. 13 Especially important was the hostile reaction to the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, which brought together Catholics (who had long opposed abortion) and evangelical Protestants (who were new to the issue).Donald T. Critchlow, ed. The politics of abortion and birth control in historical perspective (1996) Noting the anger of Catholic bishops at losing state funding because of the Catholic opposition to gay adoptive parents, along with other social issues, The New York Times reported in late 2011 as follows: > The idea that religious Americans are now the victims of government-backed > persecution is now a frequent theme not just for Catholic bishops, but also > for Republican presidential candidates and conservative evangelicals.Laurie > Goodstein, \\"Bishops Say Rules on Gay Parents Limit Freedom of Religion,\\" New > York Times Dec. 28, 2011 online = Neoconservatives = The 1970s saw the movement of many prominent liberal intellectuals to the right, many of them from New York City Jewish roots and well-established academic reputations,Alan M.

Irving Kristol and Leo Strauss were founders of the movement. The magazines Commentary and Public Interest were their key outlets, as well as op-ed articles for major newspapers and position papers for think tanks. Activists around Democratic senator Henry Jackson became deeply involved as well. Prominent spokesmen include Gertrude Himmelfarb, Bill Kristol, Paul Wolfowitz, Lewis Libby, Norman Podhoretz, Richard Pipes, David Horowitz, Charles Krauthammer, Richard Perle, Robert Kagan, Elliott Abrams and Ben Wattenberg. Meanwhile, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan was highly sympathetic but remained a Democrat. Some of Strauss' influential neoconservative disciples included Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, Paul Wolfowitz (who became Deputy Secretary of Defense), Alan Keyes (who became Assistant Secretary of State), William Bennett (who became Secretary of Education), Weekly Standard editor William Kristol, political philosopher Allan Bloom, writer John Podhoretz, college president John Agresto, political scientist Harry V. Jaffa and novelist Saul Bellow. Neoconservatives generally support pro-business policies. Some went on to high policy-making or advisory positions in the Reagan, Bush I and Bush II administrations. = Conservatism in the South = The Southern United States as defined by the United States Census Bureau The growth of conservatism within the Republican Party attracted conservative white Southern Democrats in presidential elections. A few big names switched to the GOP, including South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond in 1964 and Texas Governor John Connally in 1973. Starting in 1968, in the South the GOP dominated most presidential elections (1976 was the lone exception), but not until the 1990s did the GOP become dominant in state and local politics in the region. Through the Southern strategy, Republicans built their strength among Southern Baptists and other religious Fundamentalists, social conservatives, middle-class suburbs, migrants from the North, and Hispanic people in Florida. Meanwhile, continuing the trend since the New Deal in the 1930s, African American voters in the South showed increasing support for the Democratic Party at both the presidential and local levels. They elected a number of congressmen and mayors. In 1990, there were still many moderate white Democrats holding office in the South, but when they retired they were typically replaced by more conservative Republicans and black people. In the 21st century, political scientists point to the strong base of social conservatism in the South. The evangelical Protestants, comprising the \\"Religious Right\\", have since the 1980s strongly influenced the vote in Republican primaries, for \\"it is primarily in the South where the evangelical core of the GOP is strongest.\\"Brian Steensland and Eric L. Wright, \\"American Evangelicals and Conservative Politics: Past, Present, and Future.\\" Sociology Compass(2014) 8#6 pp. 705‚Äì17. = Think tanks and foundations = Hoover Tower at the Hoover Institution In 1971, Lewis F. Powell Jr. urged conservatives to retake command of public discourse through a concerted media outreach campaign. In Powell's view, this would involve monitoring \\"national television networks‚Ä¶; induc[ing] more 'publishing' by independent scholars who do believe in the [free enterprise] system\\"; publishing in \\"magazines and periodicals‚Äîranging from the popular magazines to the more intellectual ones\\"; issuing \\"books, paperbacks, and pamphlets\\"; and dedicating advertising dollars to \\"a sustained, major effort to inform and enlighten the American people.\\"Powell, Lewis F., \\"Attack on the American Free Enterprise System.\\" 1971 memorandum to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Conservative think tanks like the American Enterprise Institute and The Heritage Foundation brought in intellectuals for shorter or longer periods, financed research, and disseminated the products through conferences, publications, and systematic media campaigns. They typically focused on projects with immediate policy implications. Aware that the Brookings Institution had played an influential role for decades in promoting liberal ideas, the Heritage Foundation was designed as a counterpart on the right.Niels Bjerre-Poulsen, \\"The Heritage Foundation: A Second-Generation Think Tank,\\" Journal of Policy History, Apr 1991, Vol. 3 Issue 2, pp. 152‚Äì72 Meanwhile, older conservative think tanks such as the American Enterprise Institute grew rapidly as a result of major increases in conservative philanthropy. Both think tanks became more oriented to the news media, more aggressively ideological, and more focused on rapid- response production and shorter publications. At the same time, they generally eschewed long-term research in favor of projects with immediate policy implications and produced synthetic materials rather than long-term research.Thomas Medvetz. 2012. Think Tanks in America. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, ch. 3. In the following decades, conservative policies once considered outside the political mainstream‚Äîsuch as reducing welfare, privatizing Social Security, deregulating banking, considering preemptive war, ‚Äîwere taken seriously and sometimes passed into law due in part to the work of the Hoover Institution, the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, the Hudson Institute, the American Enterprise Institute, and various smaller tanks.Murray L. Weidenbaum, The Competition of Ideas: The World of the Washington Think Tanks (2011) Complaining that mainstream academia was hostile to conservatives, several foundations became especially active in funding conservative policy research, notably the Adolph Coors Foundation, the Bradley Foundation, the Koch family foundations, the Scaife Foundations, and (until it closed in 2005), the John M. Olin Foundation. Typically, they have emphasized the need for market-based solutions to national problems.Alice O'Connor, \\"Bringing the Market Back In: Philanthropic Activism and Conservative Reform,\\" Clemens, Elisabeth S., and Doug Guthrie, eds., Politics and Partnerships: The Role of Voluntary Associations in America's Political Past and Present (University of Chicago Press, 2010) pp. 121‚Äì50 The foundations often invested in conservative student publications and organizations, such as the Intercollegiate Studies Institute and legal foundations such as the Federalist Society.Jennifer DeForest, \\"Conservatism Goes to College: The Role of Philanthropic Foundations in the Rise of Conservative Student Networks,\\" Perspectives on the History of Higher Education, 2007, vol. 26, pp. 103‚Äì27, Policy entrepreneurs such as William Baroody, Edwin Feulner and Paul Weyrich started to entrench conservatism in public research institutions. Their aim was to rival the liberal regime for the control of the sources of power. The appearance of think tanks changed the history of conservatism and left an enormous imprint on the Republican right in subsequent years.Arin, Kubilay Yado (2013): Think Tanks, the Brain Trusts of US Foreign Policy. (Wiesbaden: VS Springer). = Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter = The Republican administrations of President Richard Nixon (1969‚Äì74) and Gerald Ford (1974‚Äì77) were characterized by their emphasis on d√©tente and on economic intervention through wage and price controls. Ford angered conservatives by continuing Henry Kissinger as Secretary of State and pushing his policy of d√©tente with the Soviet Union. Conservatives finally found a new champion in Ronald Reagan, whose 8 years as governor of California had just ended in 1976, and supported his campaign for the Republican nomination. Ford narrowly won renomination but lost the White House. Following major gains by Democratic liberals in the 1974 midterm election, Jimmy Carter was elected as President. Carter proved too liberal for his fellow Southern Baptists, (as they voted for him in 1976 but not 1980), too conservative for the mainstream of the Democratic Party, and many considered his foreign policy a failure. Carter realized there was a strong national sense of malaise, as inflation skyrocketed, interest rates soared, the economy stagnated, and prolonged humiliation resulted when Islamic militants in Tehran kept American diplomats hostage for 444 days in 1979‚Äì81.Laura Kalman, Right Star Rising: A New Politics, 1974‚Äì1980 (2010) details the collapse one by one of alternatives to Reagan. = 1970s recessions = During the recessions of the 1970s, inflation and unemployment rates soared simultaneously and budget deficits began to raise concerns among many Americans. In the early 1970s, America was still a moderately progressive country, as citizens supported social programs and voted down efforts to cut taxes. But by the end of the decade, a full-fledged tax revolt had gotten underway, led by the overwhelming passage in 1978 of Proposition 13 in California, which sharply cut property taxes, and the growing Congressional support for the Kemp-Roth tax bill, which proposed cutting federal income taxes by 30 percent. Supply-side economics developed during the 1970s in response to Keynesian economic policy, and in particular the failure of demand management to stabilize Western economies during the stagflation of the 1970s, in the wake of the oil crisis in 1973.Karl E. Case, & Ray C. Fair, (1999). Principles of Economics (5th ed.), p. 780. Prentice- Hall. . It drew on a range of non-Keynesian economic thought, particularly the Chicago School and Neo-Classical School.Johan van Overtveldt, The Chicago School: How the University of Chicago Assembled the Thinkers Who Revolutionized Economics and Business (2007) ch 9 = Stopping the Equal Rights Amendment = Conservative women were mobilized in the 1970s by Phyllis Schlafly in an effort to stop ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the U.S. Constitution. The ERA had seemed a noncontroversial effort to provide legal equality when it easily passed Congress in 1972 and quickly was ratified by 28 of the necessary 38 states. Schlafly denounced it as tilting the playing field against the middle-class housewife in a power grab by anti- family feminists on the left. She warned it would mean women would be drafted in the Army on the same basis as men. Through her Eagle Forum she organized state-by-state to block further ratification, and to have states rescind their ratification. Congress extended the time needed, and a movement among feminists tried to boycott tourist cities in states that had not ratified (such as Chicago and New Orleans). It was to no avail. The ERA never became law and Schlafly became a major spokesperson for feminist traditionalism in the conservative movement.Donald T. Critchlow, Phyllis Schlafly and Grassroots Conservatism: A Woman's Crusade (2005)  1980s: Reagan Era  With Ronald Reagan's victory in 1980 the modern American conservative movement took power. Republicans took control of the Senate for the first time since 1954, and conservative principles dominated Reagan's economic and foreign policies, with supply side economics and strict opposition to Soviet Communism defining the Administration's philosophy. Reagan's ideas were largely espoused and supported by the conservative Heritage Foundation, which grew dramatically in its influence during the Reagan years, extended to a second term by the 1984 presidential election, as Reagan and his senior aides looked to Heritage for policy guidance. An icon of the American conservative movement, Reagan is credited by his supporters with transforming the politics of the United States, galvanizing the success of the Republican Party. He brought together a coalition of economic conservatives, who supported his supply side economics; foreign policy conservatives, who favored his staunch opposition to Communism and the Soviet Union; and social conservatives, who identified with his religious and social ideals. Reagan labeled the Soviet Union the \\"evil empire.\\" Conservatives also supported the Reagan Doctrine, under which the U.S. provided military and other aid to insurgency movements resisting governments aligned with the Soviet Union. For these and other efforts, Reagan was attacked by liberals at the time as a dangerous warmonger, but conservative historians assert that he decisively won the Cold War.Steven F. Hayward, The Age of Reagan: The Conservative Counterrevolution 1980‚Äì1989 (2009), 625‚Äì32. Liberals say that Gorbachev ended the Cold War as the Soviet Union collapsed. Conservatives counter that Reagan's heavy pressure (such as \\"Star Wars\\") caused the collapse. Stephen G. Brooks, and William Wohlforth, \\"Clarifying the End of Cold War Debate,\\" Cold War History 2007 7(3): 447‚Äì454 In defining conservatism, Reagan said: \\"If you analyze it I believe the very heart and soul of conservatism is libertarianism. I think conservatism is really a misnomer just as liberalism is a misnomer for the liberals‚Äîif we were back in the days of the Revolution, so-called conservatives today would be the Liberals and the liberals would be the Tories. The basis of conservatism is a desire for less government interference or less centralized authority or more individual freedom and this is a pretty general description also of what libertarianism is.\\"Reason Magazine, July 1, 1975 Reagan's views on government were influenced by Thomas Jefferson, especially his hostility to strong central governments.Ronald Reagan, Reagan in His Own Hand (2001), pp. 14, 232, 359 \\"We're still Jefferson's children,\\" he declared in 1987. He also stated, \\"Freedom is not created by Government, nor is it a gift from those in political power. It is, in fact, secured, more than anything else, by limitations placed on those in Government\\".Quoted in Time July 13, 1987Hayward, The Age of Reagan p.52 Likewise he greatly admired and often quoted Abraham Lincoln.Hayward, The Age of Reagan pp. 26, 52‚Äì54; Lou Cannon. President Reagan: TheRole of a Lifetime (1991) 118, 480‚Äì1. Supply side economics dominated the Reagan Era. During his eight years in office the national debt more than doubled, from $907 billion in 1980 to $2.6 trillion in 1988, and consumer prices rose by more than 50%.The World Almanac and Book of Facts, 2009, But despite cuts in income tax rates, federal income tax revenues grew from $244 billion in 1980 to $467 billion in 1990. The real median family income, which had declined during the previous administration, grew by about ten percent under Reagan. The period from 1981 to 1989 was among the most prosperous in American history, with 17 million new jobs created. The 1980s also saw the founding of The Washington Times, a newspaper influential in the conservative movement. Reagan was said to have read the paper every morning, and the paper had close ties to multiple Republican administrations. In 1987, after the end of the fairness doctrine, conservative talk radio began to grow in significance, saving many AM radio stations. Berry, J. M., & Sobieraj, S. (2011). Understanding the rise of talk radio. PS: Political Science and Politics, 762-767.  Since 1990  Time stated there has been an identity crisis in U.S. conservatism growing since the end of the Cold War and the Presidency of Ronald Reagan. Supporters of classical liberalism‚Äîdistinct from modern liberalism‚Äîtend to identify as \\"conservatives,\\" and in the 21st century, classical liberalism remains a major force within the Republican Party and the larger conservative movement. / In the 21st Century, only in the United States is classical liberalism a significant political ideology. = 1990s = After the end of the Reagan administration significant change occurred within the conservative movement during the George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton Administrations. In 1992, many conservatives repudiated President George H. W. Bush because he campaigned to the center of the American political spectrum, whereas Bill Clinton campaigned to the right of the center. He was defeated for reelection in 1992 in a three- way race, with populist Ross Perot attracting considerable support on the right. Democrat Bill Clinton was stopped in his plan for government health care. In 1994, the GOP made sweeping gains under the leadership of Newt Gingrich, the first Republican to become Speaker in 40 years. Gingrich overplayed his hand by cutting off funding for the Federal government, allowing Clinton to regain momentum and win reelection in 1996. The \\"Contract with America\\" promised numerous reforms, but little was accomplished beyond the ending of major New Deal welfare programs. A national movement to impose term limits failed to reach Congress (because the Supreme Court ruled that a constitutional amendment was needed) but did transform politics in some states, especially California. Some sources have argued that Clinton, while a member of the Democratic Party, governed as a conservative. Beginning in the early 1990s conservative leaning internet sites began to emerge, such as Drudge Report, Free Republic, and Townhall. These websites were created due to an alleged liberal bias within mainstream media. Since then, conservative leaning internet sites have gained a significant following, and have received more readership than liberal leaning internet sites. = George W. Bush = George W. Bush speaks at a campaign rally in 2004 The election of George W. Bush in 2000 brought a new generation of conservatives to power in Washington. Bush ran under the banner of compassionate conservatism, contrasting himself with other members of the Republican Party. Bush cut taxes in a 10-year plan that was renewed in late 2010, following major debate. Bush forged a bipartisan coalition to pass \\"No Child Left Behind\\", which for the first time imposed national standards on public schools. Bush expanded Medicaid, and was criticized by conservatives. The September 2001 terrorist attacks resulted in American commitment to the War against Terror with invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. Bush won solid support from Republicans in Congress and from conservative voters in his 2004 reelection campaign. Exit polls in 2004 showed that 34% of the voters identified themselves as \\"conservatives\\" and they voted 84% for Bush. By contrast, 21% identified as \\"liberals,\\" of whom 13% voted for Bush; 45% were \\"moderates\\" and they voted 45% for Bush. Almost the same pattern had appeared in the 2000 exit polls.See CNN 2004 Exit Poll The exit polls show Bush won 57% of the rural vote, 52% of the suburban vote and 45% of the urban vote. When the financial system verged on total collapse in 2008, Bush pushed through large scale rescue packages for banks and auto companies that even some conservatives in Congress did not support.

Cannon, Reagan's Disciple (PublicAffairs, 2008) p. xii. = 2008‚Äìpresent = Sarah Palin addresses the 2008 Republican National Convention in Saint Paul, Minnesota The Republican contest for the nomination in 2008 was a free-for- all, with Senator John McCain the winner, facing Barack Obama. McCain chose Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate, and while she was greeted by the GOP establishment with initial skepticism, she electrified many conservatives and became a major political force on the right. In 2008, a period which began in 1980, termed the \\"conservative era\\" ended. After the election of Obama for president, Republicans in Congress were unified in almost total opposition to the programs and policies of Obama and the Democratic majority. They unsuccessfully attempted to stop an $814 billion stimulus spending program, new regulations on investment firms, and a program to require health insurance for all Americans. They did keep emissions trading from coming to a vote, and vow to continue to work to convince Americans that burning fossil fuel does not cause global warming.Jonathan Alter, The Promise: President Obama, Year One (2010) The slow growth of the economy in the first two years of the Obama administration led Republicans to call for a return to tax cuts and deregulation of businesses, which they perceived as the best way to solve the financial crisis. Obama's approval rating steadily declined in his first year in office before leveling off at about 50-50. This decline in popularity led to a GOP landslide in the mid-term elections of 2010.see RealClear Politics summary On foreign policy, some conservatives, especially neoconservatives and those in the National Review circle, supported Obama's policy of a surge in Afghanistan, air raids to support the insurgents in Libya, and the war on terror, especially after he ordered the killing of Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan in May 2011.Rich Lowry, \\"A Victory for America,\\" National Review Online May 3, 2011Michael Barone, \\"To Get Bin Laden, Obama Relied on Policies He Decried\\" National Review Online May 5, 2011 At issue in 2012 was the efficacy of diplomacy and sanctions in stopping Iran from building nuclear weapons.\\"Obama defends sanctions strategy on Iran, says diplomacy can work,\\" FoxNews March 6, 2012 In the 2016 Republican Party presidential primary, Donald Trump won.

Tea Party  Tea Party protesters walk towards the United States Capitol during the Taxpayer March on Washington, September 12, 2009 A relatively new element of conservatism is the Tea Party movement, a populist grassroots movement comprising over 600 local units who communally express dissatisfaction with the government and both major parties.See online Amy Gardner, \\"Gauging the scope of the tea party movement in America,\\" Washington Post Oct. 24, 2010 Many units have promoted activism and protests.Kate Zernike, Boiling Mad: Inside Tea Party America (2010), by a New York Times reporter The stated purpose of the movement is to stop what it views as wasteful government spending, excessive taxation, and strangulation of the economy through regulatory bureaucracies. The Tea Party attracted national attention when it propelled Republican Scott Brown to a victory in the Senate election for the Massachusetts seat held by the Kennedy brothers for nearly 60 years.Scott Rasmussen and Doug Schoen, Mad As Hell: How the Tea Party Movement Is Fundamentally Remaking Our Two-Party System (2010) pp. 169‚Äì82 In 2010, Tea Party candidates upset establishment Republicans in several primaries, such as Alaska, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Nevada, New York, South Carolina, and Utah, giving a new momentum to the conservative cause in the 2010 elections, and boosting Sarah Palin's visibility.

It is based upon the play by Georges Bernanos, which in turn was adapted from the novel by Gertrud von Le Fort. It's the story of the Martyrs of Compi√®gne, Carmelite nuns who were guillotined in Paris in 1794 in the waning days of the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution, after refusing to renounce their vocation. Plot  During the difficult years of the French Revolution, the young noblewoman Bianca, on the advice of her father, the Marquis de la Force, decided to enter the cloistered convent of the Carmelites of Compi√®gne. The need to find a safe refuge is accompanied by a certain religious vocation, but, despite this, Bianca is afraid of facing sacrifices and suffering and is afraid of not being up to her choice. Soon the revolutionary authorities and the people will begin to annoy the nuns, accused of being reactionary, enemies of the homeland, who grab riches and give hospitality to the fugitives. Forced to leave the convent, the nuns vow to be willing to sacrifice their lives so that the Catholic religion can survive in France. Dispersed in small groups, almost all of them will be arrested, found guilty and sentenced to death. The procession that accompanies them to the Square of the Reversed Throne, where the execution will take place, will cross the streets of Paris between prayers, blessings and religious songs. Bianca de la Force, with courage, will climb the gallows in place of Mother Mary of the Incarnation, who will be the only one to be saved and who alone will have to continue to practice the teaching of Carmel.

The event was held at the Homebush Street Circuit in Sydney Olympic Park, New South Wales, and was scheduled to consist of two races of 125 kilometres and one race of 250 kilometres in length. It was the final round of the 2014 International V8 Supercars Championship, and marked the series return of 2003 and 2004 Champion Marcos Ambrose. Report Will Davison scored the first pole position for Erebus Motorsport after qualifying for Race 36 was suspended with a minute remaining. Champion drivers Craig Lowndes and wildcard entry Marcos Ambrose both drove into the wall at the infamous turn 5, causing the red flag. 2014 series champ Jamie Whincup took the lead from Davison at turn 1 on the first lap. After pit stops, Walkinshaw Racing's Tim Slade took the lead and led for the majority of the race. With a few laps remaining, Whincup reclaimed the lead and won the race ahead of Slade. Rod Nash Racing's David Reynolds finished third, scoring his first and only podium finish of the season. The weather had overshadowed the start of Race 37, possibly recreating a repeat of the 2010 event. The rain held off at the start of the race as Whincup shot from 4th on the grid to the lead after turn 1. Ambrose had a shocking start to the second race after being spun around on turn 1. The safety car was deployed on lap 19 after torrential rain proved hard for the drivers, too hard for David Wall who left it too late change for wet tyres and collected the wall at turn 2. Soon after, the race was red flagged after lightning and thunderstorms rolled in. The race continued under the safety car after the rain died down. Time expired on lap 23 and Whincup was declared the winner, claiming back-to-back wins on Saturday. Shane van Gisbergen and Scott McLaughlin rounded out the podium placings. After Sunday's Top 10 Shootout, McLaughlin scored pole position for the final race of the season. He and Whincup managed to score the most pole positions of the season with 10 apiece. The final race started on a wet track with Garth Tander taking the lead after the first turn. Mark Winterbottom's quest for second in the championship ended early after driving straight ahead at turn 1 on the first lap. At the half-way mark, the race was again overshadowed by severe thunderstorms. As the safety car was called out, Tander locked up and went straight ahead at turn 9, handing the lead to Van Gisbergen. After 44 of 74 laps, the race was suspended and later abandoned after more torrential rain battered down on the circuit, with Van Gisbergen taking the win for the final race of the season having completed over 50% of the race distance, which is required to award points. For the second event in a row, Tander narrowly missed out on a race win and had to settle for second. Teammate James Courtney made it a 2-3 finish for the Holden Racing Team. Whincup collected his sixth championship trophy, a new record for the most championships in the ATCC/V8 Supercars. The race win for Van Gisbergen gave him second place in the standings, with Winterbottom sliding down to third in the championship after a disastrous weekend in Sydney. After nine years since his last V8 Supercar event, Marcos Ambrose finished 20th, 21st and 16th respectively in the three races.

Diana takes advantage of Elena's presence to distract the young Milanese industrialist, Paolo Donati, who is trying to woo his mother. After a couple of meetings organized by Diana, Paolo invites Elena for a trip on his yacht. After a walk in Portofino, where they meet Martina, a Dutch tourist, the inexperienced Elena is fascinated by Paolo and in a short time falls in love with him. Thinking about starting a great love story, she lets herself be seduced and becomes pregnant. Back in Milan, Elena realizes that Paolo has become detached and considers theirs only a summer adventure now over. Even after learning about the pregnancy, Paolo remains cold and even suggests that Elena have an abortion. For this reason, more by impulse than by conviction, Elena decides to ask him for money, to avoid reporting him for having seduced a minor. Paolo accepts and gives her a check that Elena will never cash. The parents try to convince the two boys to get back together to give the unborn child a family. But Paolo has started a new story with Martina, the Dutch tourist he met on vacation, and Elena has understood that she cannot marry a man only out of necessity, as her mother had done years ago by accepting a marriage of interest.

At her death, she was one of only four of her subspecies overall. She was outlived by male Sudan and females Najin and Fatu. Background Nola was wild caught in the Shambe area, which is located \\"in the southern savanna woodlands of Sudan. She was rescued from the violent poaching that is prevalent in that region when she was only a few years old.\\" Her age upon capture has been estimated more closely at being 18 months old. She belonged to the Dv≈Ør Kr√°lov√© Zoo in the Czech Republic, but since 1989 she had been on loan in San Diego. San Diego Zoo Nola lived at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park‚Äôs South Africa field habitat. She was in the same enclosure as her counterpart Angalifu, but he was moved to the Central Africa field habitat at the zoo before his death on December 14, 2014. Nola's lead keeper at the zoo was Jane Kennedy. While at the zoo, Nola had been described by PBS as \\"independent and aggressive\\". A photographer who shot photos of Nola numerous times said, \\"As any rhino might, Nola enjoys her daily belly scratches and neck rubs, carrots, and the occasional bucket of apples.

Erdos said he has visited Nola \\"at least a dozen times.\\" Breeding In 1996, Nola refused advances by Angalifu, a male northern white rhino at the San Diego Zoo that staff hoped would mate. Nola was given hormones to make her more receptive to Angalifu's advances. After her food was mixed with prostaglandin, followed by a two-week daily dose of oral progesterone, Nola became receptive to Angalifu's advances and the two mated for 20-30 minutes the first time. Following that mating, the two continued to copulate, but no pregnancy resulted from the pairing. Nola was too old to be bred at that point, and as of 2014 was considered \\"elderly\\". In 2015 she suffered from recurring abscesses on one hip. Death Nola had been under veterinary care for a bacterial infection, as well as age-related health issues.

Gasparis de Chayrate de Mediolano before 1489Since the first document attesting the existence of the artist is the payment for a work in 1489, the date of birth may be traced back at least two decades before. ‚Äì Brescia, died before 1517),Declared dead in this year by his widow Bianca (see Zani 2010, p. 102, note 85) was an Italian sculptor of the Renaissance. The artist emerged in 1489 as part of the cultural world of Milan, beginning a successful career that turned him into a leading exponent of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia, distinguishing himself with works of cultural import such as his cycle of the Caesars for the Loggia palace in Brescia, as well as the Mausoleum of Martinengo. He introduced a powerful and highly expressive classical taste, as opposed to the hitherto existing refined decorativeness. During the first decade of the sixteenth century, Gasparo was able to win over public and private clients who sought to translate into stone their pride in their supposed historical descent from ancient Rome. After his death, Gasparo's reputation fell into oblivion caused by unfavourable secular criticism. His complex artistic personality and catalog of works were only reconstructed from the end of the twentieth century, thanks to targeted critical studies that have for the first time allowed a thorough analysis and rediscovery of his works. Biography The cupola of the church of Santa Maria dei Miracoli with its cycle of the Apostles by Gasparo Cairano and some of the Angels of Antonio della Porta (1489) Duomo Vecchio of Brescia, with the two keystones of Gasparo Cairano (1491) Nothing is known of Gasparo Cairano before 1489. No information has been found about the date and place of his birth, education, or the circumstances that led him to Brescia. The appellation da Milano, with which he is often recalled in the sources, however, does not provide a definitive fact of his origin because it could refer to the city as well as to the dukedom or diocese. The generic reference, in any case, is compatible with the cultural basis of his artistic work. Some conjectures can be made on the surname Cairano, in particular that it leads one to Cairate in Varese province, which is to this day shortened to Caira in the local dialect.Historical sources provide other variations of the last name of Gasparo. See Zani 2010, p. 102, n. 85 and notes in the preamble to this article. Career =The Santa Maria dei Miracoli= Cairano first documented work is from December 24, 1489Archivio Storico di Santa Maria dei Miracoli, cart. A, fasc. 3 with his commission for the cycle of twelve statues of the Apostles to be installed in the first dome of the church of Santa Maria dei Miracoli, Brescia. The installation of Cairano's cycle is contemporaneous with Tamagnino's installation of the twelve angels in the lower section of the dome. In general, all the stone sculptures at the Santa Maria dei Miracoli laid down in the decade following the cycle of the Apostles were limited to the interior of the building, and were by Cairano and his associates. There is a possibility that this limitation was the result of a confrontation between Cairano and Tamagnino. At the time Cairano worked on his Apostles, Tamagnino was the better regarded sculptor, and his superiority is evident in the artistic and technical quality of his Angels, if only for their relative modernity, following the neo-classical mode of Antonio Rizzo. It is likely, therefore, that there was some local support that allowed Cairano to penetrate Tamagnino's stronghold in Brescia, despite the former's relative underdevelopment as an artist. On the other hand, Tamagnino only created five other works within the church, and he was paid for the entire body of his work less than Cairano for his Apostles. Following this debacle, Tamagnino left the site of the church and Brescia, and only returned a decade later.See the paragraph below on Relations with Tamagnino =The keystones of the old Duomo= Cairano's art and career began a rapid ascent following several other commissions for work within the sanctum of the Santa Maria dei Miracoli. On November 16, 1941, he was paid for two keystones for the vault of the old Duomo which was being built under the aegis of Bernardino da Martinengo. Cairano was given the sole commission for figurative sculptures in the new building. Two years later, in 1493, Cairano began work at the courtyard of the Loggia palazzo. Evidently there was a burst in overlapping commitments and commission, both public and ecclesiastical, many of which were more important than his debut work at the Santa Maria dei Miracoli. Indeed, work in that church stopped around the same time. The sculptor returned to it only for occasional work over the following years to the end of the century;Ceriana, pp. 146, 148‚Äì149. It is also reminiscent of the San Gregorio medallion in the spandrels of the dome, part of the cycle of Doctors of the Church left unfinished by Tamagnino and also dated to about 1495‚Äì1500. For the dating of this work see Zani 2010, p. 121. overall, however, work ceased until the mid- sixteenth century. =Sculptures of the Palazzo della Loggia= On August 30, 1493, Cairano was tasked with the decoration of the exterior of the Palazzo della Loggia with the delivery of capita 5 imperatorum romanum, or five busts for the beginning of a cycle of thirty Caesars, which would become among the finest achievements of his career. The production of these busts can be traced, in general, to a contemporary reworking of ancient portraiture. In the oldest busts, i.e., those facing the piazza, there are similarities with the image of Bartolomeo Colleoni in the memorial by Andrea del Verrochio in Venice, with an evoking of an effigy of Antoninus Pius and a portrait of Nero, all famous images at the time and here revived in three dimensions. A considerable leap in quality is evident here, compared to the Apostles of the church of Santa Maria dei Miracoli that had been carved just a few years earlier. The cycle of the Caesars is not only considerably grander in size but also a notable qualitative improvement over the previous production. The presence of these Caesars on the fa√ßade of the Loggia in Brescia is testament of an architectural and figurative leap, a full expression of classical art that has climbed from the earlier experiments at the Miracoli. Cairano, through the creation of the cycle and subsequent architectural ornamentation of the Loggia palazzo, becomes the fulcrum of commissions, both public and private, from Brescians keen to show off their descent from ancient Rome and to ride the wave of the local Renaissance. Around 1497, while continuing with his work on the Caesars, Cairano also developed five keystones for the portico of the Loggia palazzo, representing Sant'Apollonio, San Faustino, San Giovita, Justice and Faith. Between 1499 and 1500, he delivered two large trophies to be placed on the top order of palazzo, while between 1493 and 1505, Cairano participated in the fulfilment of leonine protome, capitals, and candelabras and friezes for the same top order. The attention of the artist to his craft and productions is evident, and it influenced in general all the decorative sculptural works made for the palazzo at the time. Cairano's concentration on the Caesars is interrupted only briefly by the return of Tamagnino between 1499 and 1500. Tamagnino, likely based on his lauded works at the Certosa di Pavia, receives a commission for six different Caesars and other sculptures. But in an art scene increasingly monopolised by Cairano, who has come a long way from his naive expression of the Apostles, Tamagnino does not garner much attention, and, humiliated by the cold reception, he leaves Brescia, probably never to return. =The private commissions of Brunelli and Caprioli= Funerary monument of Gaspare Brunelli, 1496‚Äì1500 Having gained prestige from the constructions in the Loggia, Cairano received at least two commissions from the nobility of Brescia. Involved in the leadership of the new administration, they were certainly aware of his ability. There are papers dating back to 1496 that document Cairano's commission for the Tomb of Gaspare Brunelli, which, in 1500, was placed in the Brunelli chapel within the Church of St Francis. During the same period, the Caprioli family commissioned the tomb of Luigi Caprioli to be placed within their chapel in the church of San Giorgio, probably together with other sculptures, made probably in collaboration with the Sanmicheli workshop, to which is attributed the marble jamb decorated with candelabras. Caprioli's memorial was broken up in the nineteenth century,Possibly in 1805, even before the church was condemned. See Zani 2010, p. 117. so only the Caprioli Adoration remains. A masterpiece of Cairano's, this was placed in 1841 by Rodolfo Vantini on the high altar of the St Francis of Assisi church. Cairano demonstrates a high technical mastery, not only in the extremely precise orientation of the boxes, but also in the choice of the monolithic block, which, in fact, is not strictly necessary for this kind of work. From Bernardino Faino and Francesco Paglia and other seventeenth and eighteenth century scholars, we know that the relief was placed by some architectural system. It was supposed to be a figurative piece, created perhaps by the same artist, but which has not been traced. =The sculptures of San Pietro in Oliveto and San Francesco= Interior of the church of San Pietro in Oliveto (circa 1507) The altar of San Girolamo (circa 1506‚Äì1510) In 1503, Cairano made the last deliveries in the Caesar cycle for the front of the Loggia palace, and finished up the bulk of his work on the site; no further records of his presence exist.The production of generic decorative scores continued for a few more years, until the interruption of the work for reasons of war, but not necessarily under the guidance of Gasparo, though could still visit the site often to follow this final phase. See Zani 2010, p. 107. For the artist, this was the end of his big public commissions, which he probably gained before establishing his career and subsequent success. He now had to reorganise his business and set up closer ties with the contacts he made during his work at the Loggia, including co- workers and other artists in and around Brescia, looking for major commissions. However, his path appeared to lead him increasingly toward sacred art. In 1504, the canon of the Basilica of San Pietro de Dom, Francisco Franzi of Orzinuovi bequeathed the construction of a chapel in the cathedral. Nothing further is known of this commission.Archivio del Duomo di Brescia, Pergamene, n. 239. By 1507, however, Cairano's decorative lapidary work in the interior of the San Pietro in Oliveto became known as the third great achievement of the artist, after the Miracoli and the Loggia.The date MDVII is legible on the arch of the choir The architectural scores that punctuate the sequence of the altar and the composition of the whole, however, are unrelated to Cairano's style. Rather, they are consistent with Sanmicheli, who indeed possessed the only workshop in town capable of engaging a work of this magnitude. Certainly the twelve Apostles in the spandrels in the arches of the nave are Cairano's work - the artist's hand is unmistakable. There is very poor and fragmentary documentation relating to this historic building that has come down to us. To Cairano, also, is attributed the Altar of San Girolamo in the church of St Francis. One of the critical issues of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia is the lack of historical sources on its origin. Certainly the altar was carved after 1506,On the base of the left column there is an effigy of Pope Julius II inferred from the obverse of a medal of Caradosso and Gian Cristoforo Romano cast after 1506. See Zani 2010, p. 125. given its high quality and artistic originality, indeed the highest level of art in the Brescian period, and evokes several features of Cairano's earlier work on the Loggia and front-yard of San Pietro's church in Oliveto. =The entrance of the Sal√≤ duomo= The Entrance to the Duomo of Sal√≤ (1506‚Äì1508) The construction of the entrance to the Duomo of Sal√≤ is copiously documented between 1506 and 1509. The design was by Cairano, most likely in collaboration with Antonio Mangiacavalli. Cairano's hand is evident in the figures of the Father, St. Peter and St. John the Baptist, leaving the Virgin to his collaborator, while the Angel of the Annunciation and two small busts in the spandrels appear to be a joint work. The architectural parts were accomplished by different stonemasons as recorded in the documents relating to the workshops, including Mangiacavalli's son. The portal was put in place by August 1508, and embellishments and other work ended at the beginning of 1509. The work at Sal√≤ and associated documentation, reconstructed through the numerous bills and payments, attests to the complex relationship between Cairano and Mangiacavalli. They shared staff, which was directed by either of them depending on who was on site. Such collaborative work, which has already been noted at San Pietro in Oliveto are emblematic of Cairano's artistic activity, which became increasingly busy and varied as public and private commissions poured in the first decade of the sixteenth century following the work at the Loggia palazzo. However, Cairano's attention was not directed to Sal√≤, which he visited rarely, or even to San Pietro in Oliveto, which was mainly run by Sanmicheli, but to two works of greater importance and resonance: the grand staircase of the Loggia and the arch at Sant'Apollonio. =The return to the Loggia: the grand staircase= Entrance to the grand stairs of the Palazzo della Loggia (1503‚Äì1508) By 1508, construction work was completed at the north of the Loggia,This is the year reported on the front of the bridge towards the square, probably indicating the date of completion of work. which contained the staircase to access the upper level of the public building. The construction is designed as a body in itself, separated from the main building by a path and connected to it by a covered overpass, a configuration that has come down to us intact. The contribution of Cairano, who at that point returned to the Loggia after at least five years of a stellar career elsewhere, is the portal to the ground floor of the annex and in some ornamentation on the overpass. The entrance is resolved in a manner simultaneously elegant and eccentric, in an almost exuberant and free syntax. The canonical orders are absent, and the collection is conceived as an imaginative blend of quasi-archaeological redeployment. For this reason, critics do not attribute the project to Cairano, which remains a formidable invention that is highly representative of antiquarian culture of the time. Surely Cairano's, however, is the hand that produced the sculptures along with anthropomorphic figures, dolphins and fantastic creatures, the artist already experimented with these in the Loggia; and once again, the artist inserted small Caesars, both on the portal as well as the overpass, which achieve the poetic zenith of some of his portraiture of old. =The ark of Sant'Apollonio= The Ark of Sant'Appollonio (1508‚Äì1510) On January 5, 1503, the relics of Sant'Appollonio were discovered in the Basilica of San Pietro de Dom.Archivio di Stato di Brescia, Archivio Storico Civico, provisions, 1528, c. 67r.Liber Buletarum Fabrice Ecclesie Maioris. 1486‚Äì1571 (BQ, Ms. F. VII. 24), cc. 33r-v. In June, a resolution of the General council asked the chamber of notaries to finance a new reliquary ark,Archivio di Stato di Brescia, Archivio Storico Civico, provisions, 519, c. 16r. which however was not immediately funded. In 1506, the Council issued a peremptory reminder to the chamber for the funds,Archivio di Stato di Brescia, Archivio Storico Civico, provisions, cart. 520, cc. 80v-81r. and the works probably began in September 1508.Archivio di Stato di Brescia, Archivio Storico Civico, provisions, cart. 521, c. 128r. The relics were to be ceremoniously transferred to the reliquary in July 1510,Archivio di Stato di Brescia, Archivio Storico Civico, provisions, 1528, c. 171r. by which time the ark was to have been finished. Hence, it is possible to date the implementation of the project to 1508‚Äì1510. In 1505, the ark of San Tiziano, designed by Sanmicheli, had been put in place in the Church of the Saints Cosma and Damiano in Brescia. This had had a resonance in the artistic world at the time, and led to the revival of a workshop that was no longer quite in vogue. Cairano committed deeply into the ark of Sant'Appollonio, which counts among his major works and effectively supplants Sanmicheli's ark for monumentality and refined ornamentation. In the new work, Cairano provides further proof of his abilities, excelling forcefully in a scenario where he is peerless, and responding to Sanmicheli with a production of the highest quality. Vito Zani pointed out in 2012 that the face of San Faustino is unfinished; it has been brought to a level of definition close to the sanding surface. These parts were not ground flat, but worked with a chisel directly, thereby ignoring the canonical technical process, and providing further evidence of the virtuosity of Gasparo Cairano in sculpting heads.That is, the mode of execution of this statue, which is visible due to lack of polishing, shows that Gasparo Cairano sculpted his works directly with a flat chisel, probably without ever resorting to the toothed chisel. See =The sack of Brescia and after= The Loggia palazzo in Brescia At the end of the first decade of the century, the political climate in Europe was feverish: the War of the League of Cambrai had begun. The French, under Gaston of Foix, Duke of Nemours, had sacked Brescia in 1512, the town now in ruins and the myth of Brixia magnipotens shattered.See Zani 2010, pp. 24‚Äì25. with related notes to the text, bibliography and documentation cited. A lively era of humanism and trade was ended, a phenomenon that would affect the rest of the peninsula in the following decades. The great Renaissance projects of Brescia were interrupted by the war. Even the Loggia palazzo, where Cairano had already established scaffolds to mount the figures on the second level, including two angular trophies, was not to see a resumption of work till fifty years later, under the direction of Ludovico Beretta. The town's priorities had changed from artistic pomp and cultural recovery to basic necessities and vital functions. Cairano was undoubtedly affected by this period of sudden and profound decay, if only because of the sharp decline in commissions. After a decade of intense activity with several overlapping projects, a new stage in his career began, one which is obscured from the documentary view. The last relevant document in this regard is the contract for the entrance to the Duomo of Chiari in 1513, while the next document, in 1517, states that Cairano was already dead. Apart from this, there are other works from the period attributed to him, including the complex question of the completion of the Martinengo mausoleum. =The entrance of the Chiari duomo and work in Parma= In 1513, Gasparem de Cayrano de Mediolano lapicida architectum et ingeniarum optimum signed the contract for the construction of a new entrance to the Duomo of Chiari.BMC, scroll, Processo Savallo 1545, cassaforte A.1.5; notary: Lorenzo Bocchi. The document, a reconfirmation of an earlier negotiation, shows that the artist and the municipality had agreed terms two years earlier, but the plans hadn't been executed because of the war in the Brescia area. The contract provided for the fulfilment of the entire project - from the architectural parts to the figurative sculptures, including a group with the Madonna between the Saints Faustino and Giovita. These are now missing, so it's impossible to assess the evolution of Cairano's art after the completion of the ark of Sant'Appollonio. The rest of the work, moreover, again raise questions about the architectural skills of the artist that are still unanswered. Also attributable to Gasparo Cairano, and dated at this stage, is the singular St John the Baptist placed in the tympanum of the capitol of the eponymous Abbey in Parma. The work, undocumented and traditionally attributed by critics to Antonio Ferrari d'Agrate, was assigned in 2010 to the catalog of the works of Cairano due to obvious correlation with the mature art of the artist. This spread of Gasparo's artistic reach is significant and demonstrates that he could prove a success even outside of Brescia. =The Martinengo mausoleum= The Martinengo mausoleum (1503‚Äì1518) One of the questions on the later years of Cairano's career is that of the completion of the Martinengo mausoleum, the largest funereal monument of the Brescian renaissance.There are several hypotheses for possible reconstructions of the story, which is very complex from a historico- critical point of view. See Zani 2010, pp. 109, 135‚Äì138, and the literature on this monument indicated in Zani 2010, p. 138. The commission to the jeweller and sculptor Bernardino delle Croci by the brothers Francesco and Antonio Il Martinengo of Padernello dated to 1503,Archivio di Stato di Brescia, Notarile, cart. 114, notaio Conforti Cristoforo q. Antonio. with a term of three years for completion. The tomb was to house the remains of Bernardino Martinengo, the father of the two, who had left a bequest towards the work on his death in 1501 or 1502. However, it was still unfinished in 1516, when delle Croci was commissioned per a new contract to finish it by January 1518.Archivio di Stato di Brescia, Notarile, cart. 249, notaio Gandini Antonio. The causes for the delay appear to have been, firstly, a commercial dispute between the jeweller and the clients, and secondly the war of 1512, which surely slowed the work, even if not entirely stopping it. It was not until 1516, following the reconquest of Brescia by the Venetian republic, that a new definitive agreement was made. The documents are incomplete but in fact the monument was completed and installed within the Corpus Christi church, probably within the terms of the contract. Martinengo mausoleum, Scene of sacrifice (post-1510) Martinengo mausoleum, Battle scene (post-1510) The documentation of the various phrases of the construction makes no mention of anyone other than Bernardino delle Croci, but it is not clear if he really had the skills the create a sculptural structure of this type. A reappraisal of Brescian art of the period, as well as the clear evidence of the style, have led critics to assign to Cairano the execution of the stone parts of the monument, limiting delle Croci's involvement only to the bronze inserts. The jeweller, consequently, assumed the entire Martinengo commission but entrusted the parts outside his competence, most of the monument in fact, to the Cairano studio. Note that the final contract with delle Croci was in 1516This is a complex historico-critical discourse as evidenced by extant documentation; indeed, their interpretation is still debated. Besides Zani 2010, pp. 109, 135‚Äì138, see the considerations presented in and and the notes to the text and bibliography therein. whereas Cairano was definitively dead in 1517:Archivio di Stato di Brescia, Archivio Storico Civico, polizze d'estimo, cart. 254, [estimi 1517, II-VII S. Faustino]. if Cairano indeed worked on the monument, it can be deduced from the documents that he would not have had sufficient time to finish it completely within the period, and consequently a large part of it must have been done before this date.Likely, Gasparo was unable to see the work completed; its execution could have been taken over by the studio and, in particular, by his son Simone. See Zani 2010, p. 138. This means admitting Cairano's involvement prior to 1516, which is not attested in the documents.An initial participation of the Sanmicheli, Bartolomeo and his son Matteo, cannot be ruled out, at least for the first design and execution of the monument, because its dominant decorative elements are alien to Cairano's style. See Zani 2010, p. 137. Indeed, the same contract of 1516 asserts that the work was incomplete when installed in the church; it is unknown what its condition was at the time; and the remains of Bernardino Martinengo were already housed in it from the previous year. The implication is that the progress on the monument may have been near completion, at least in the structure and architectural components. The incompleteness alluded to in the documents of 1516 likely refer to the decorative inserts of various types, including the bronzes definitively due to della Croci. A thorough stylistic analysis of the ornamentation of the monument, in particular of the figures within the circles of the Battle scene and the Scene of sacrifice reveal a surprising sensitivity to bronze on the part of Cairano, and considerable scope for reinterpretation and commingling of styles. This stemmed from a sensible response to the context in which the mausoleum was designed and implemented. Unprecedented in Brescia was the combination of bronze and stone, the former under the supervision of Bernardino delle Croci who certainly had a vast catalogue of references to ancient and contemporary works, all of which are cited in the major and minor rounds on the base. It is difficult to exclude Cairano from the influence of so much classicism, but the sole Scene of sacrifice attests to the sophistication of his chisel and the innovative combination of sculpture and bronzes around 1510, to which date much of the remaining lapidary apparatus can also be placed.This dialogue of stone with bronze is found in Cairano's oeuvre, namely the contemporary altar of San Girolamo in the Church of St Francis of Assisi, where the extraordinary adaptation of Andrea Mantegna's Battle of the sea gods is typical of bronze work, imparting similar scenes along continuous circular bands. In this case, the main referents may be Pier Jacopo Alari Bonacolsi's Gonzaga Vase (1480‚Äì1483) in the Galleria Estense at Modena, and the bases of the three pillars in the Piazza San Marco in Venice, executed by Alessandro Leopardi in 1505. See =Works after 1510= The Pala Kress (c. 1505‚Äì1510) Saint between the Apostles of the Santa Maria dei Miracoli (c. 1510‚Äì1515) Stylistic considerations place a number of works, usually small statues, reliefs or fragments removed from their original context and scattered in different locations to the middle of the second decade of the sixteenth century. It is not yet clear whether these artefacts were due to Cairano or the immediate result of his collaborators, for example, his son Simone. These are works in which the boundary between the maturity of Cairano's art and the work of the studio is blurred, and discernment depends on an analysis of Cairano's development from his earliest works, such as the Sanctuary of Miracles and the Loggia,See, for the references to the models of Loggia, the roundel with the Scene of the battle of the Martinengo mausoleum, while for the latest evolution of the Apostles, see the statues of St Peter and St Paul in the crown of the same monument as well as the Saint inserted in cycle of the dome of Santa Maria dei Miracoli. Zani 2010, pp. 109‚Äì110, 137‚Äì138, 140‚Äì141. combined with clear attempts at cultural update. This is the case, for example, with Cairano's Lamentation over the dead Christ preserved in The Museum of Ancient Art, Milan, and the Descent from the Cross in the Santa Giulia Museum of Brescia, which seem to point to pictorial models of Giovanni Bellini and Girolamo Romani. Another prominent work, dated to the first decade of the century, is the so-called Pala Kress in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.. After the contract in 1513 for the entrance of the cathedral of Chiari, Cairano is no longer named in any document known. The first relevant text following, in chronological order, is a policy of valuation in 1517 of Bianca, his wife, which states she is already a widow. The death of Cairano is then placed between these two dates, probably around 1515 or a little later. =Artistic legacy= There is some documentation that allows us to reconstruct a genealogy of artists after Gasparo, from his son Simone onwards. Though little information is available about Simone, it appears that no works are attributed directly to him; rather, he appears to have worked as a builder when outside his father's workshop.See Boselli, p 289. The recovered documents range between 1519 to 1548. In a bill dated 1534,Archivio di Stato di Brescia, Archivio Storico Civico, polizze d'estimo, cartt. 30, 257b, [estimi 1534, II-VII S. Faustino]. Simone declares his age as 38, born in 1496, and around twenty years of age on his father's death. He also cites his firstborn son Gasparo, twelve years old, in turn a sculptor,Camillo Boselli has published some documents on \\"Gasparo Cairano the Younger\\" that place him between 1545 and 1558: see Boselli, p. 150 (document summary). Among these are recorded his membership in a stonecutters' guild in 1557; also dated the same year, a contract for the execution of some columns for the monastery of Santa Giulia in Brescia. his wife Catlina, sister of the engraver Andrea Testi of Manerbio. A daughter of Gasparo, Giulia, became the wife of an artisan potter, while a third child, Giovanni Antonio, was a qualified goldsmith, as indicated in a deed relating Stefano Lamberti and Bernardino delle Croci.Archivio di Stato di Brescia, Fondo Religione, 109, c. 119. In light of this information, it is unlikely that Cairano, at his death, was able to pass on an artistic legacy to assure the survival of his studio, despite having trained his son and other co-workers, as well as artists such as Ambrogio Mazzola,For a biographical outline of and documents and works attributed to Mazzola, see Zani 2010, p. 110, note 145. whose Madonna and Child, signed and dated 1536 and preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, clearly shows the influence of Cairano's style from thirty years before. This appears to be a nostalgic and naive tribute to a master, who apparently had bequeathed an artistic footprint that his collaborators not only replicated tirelessly but also felt unable to evolve further. Gasparo Cairano in the Brescia Renaissance An understanding of the artistic personality of Gasparo Cairano has to be mediated by a proper contextualization of the contemporary art scene of Brescia. He can be referred to as a novice artist at the beginning, when the Lombard migrant, like many of his contemporaries, arrived in Brescia during the innovative construction of the Santa Maria dei Miracoli and started a successful career. That historic moment, with the municipality in search of innovating artists, was also beneficial: he proved able to interpret in stone the boastful self-celebration of the high offices, public and private, of renaissance Brescia. He quickly became the leading innovator of sculptural practice in the region, continually outperforming the already weak competition, which appeared mainly in the shape of Sanmicheli and Antonio della Porta. =Competitors: Cairano and Sanmicheli= Studio of Sanmicheli, Ark of San Tiziano (1505) The competition that quickly developed between Cairano and the experts of the Sanmicheli studio is evident in the artworks and their chronological sequence. They had been the major artistic personalities of the city at least since the beginning of the construction of Santa Maria dei Miracoli and ended up supplanted by the rise of the new master sculptor. The first documentary evidence of the company of the Sanmicheli brothers, Bartolomeo and Giovanni, originally from Porlezza on Lake Como, appears in the 1480s in Verona; by the end of the century, they had obtained important commissions in various northern Italian cities.In particular, note the chapel of the Blessed Sacrament in the Mantua Cathedral, one of the few Sanmicheli works of the fifteenth century that have survived to this day; also, a lost chapel in the Bergamo church of the Holy Spirit. For the Mantuan chapel, see Ferrari & Zanata, pp. 84,94,98; for the rest, see Zani 2010, p. 93, note 29. The sculptors very likely also operated in Brescia because Bartolomeo was known to have resided there at least between 1501 and 1503,In support of this thesis, there is a direct source, specifically a 1503 deed from Brescia that asserts Bartolomeo as a Brescian resident; an indirect reference is the Veronese registry office that lists (in 1501 and 1502) Paolo Sanmicheli as a son of Bartolomeo de Brixia. See Zani 2010, p. 93, note 30. and such a long presence can be justified only by admitting the existence of significant local commissions. There is reason to believe that the Sanmicheli organisation should have deeper roots in Brescia during the two years mentioned, ranging from the construction of dei Miracoli to that of the Loggia.The Sanmicheli, according to the interpretation of the historical sources of the time, would be the designers and site managers of the facade of the sanctuary of Miracoli (see the former Historical Archive of Santa Maria dei Miracoli, today the Brunelli Archive in the parochial registry of Bassano Bresciano, not accessible, mazzo 1, n. 1, see Guerrini 1930, pp. 211‚Äì218 for a transcription); several works of the Loggia (Baldassarre Zamboni, Collectanea de rebus Brixiae, Queriniana Library, Ms. H. III. 2 M. ). The identification, in this case, is also based on a variety of stylistic and documentary evidence as reported by Giorgio Vasari in his Lives on Jacopo Sanmicheli. See Zani 2010, pp. 93‚Äì94 and notes to the text. With the Loggia, however, the mature talent of Cairano broke into the Brescian art scene, and his powerful sculptural sequence of the Caesars testifies to the decline of the Sanmicheli, whose ornate style was no longer of interest to the municipality and nobility. In possibly the last years of the 15th century, the Sanmicheli were involved in the stone decoration of the Caprioli chapel in the Church of San Giorgio, for which Cairano, almost simultaneously, prepared his Adoration, demonstrating for the first time outside of the Loggia a cooperation between the two studios. Bartolomeo Sanmicheli, at the beginning of the new century, attempted at this point to make a comeback in the local art scene with the Ark of San Tiziano of 1505, characterized by a strong decorative quality. He possibly also aspired to the commission of the ark of Sant'Apollonio, which had been up for grabs since the discovery of the relics of the holy bishop in 1503.Archivio di Stato di Brescia, Archivio Storico Civico, provisions, 522, cc. 130r-v. An early involvement of Sanmicheli can be surmised in the Martinengo mausoleum, but the commission was awarded to Bernardino dei Crossi in 1503. However, based on the prevailing decorative nature of the monument, which is much more rigorously classical, it can be attributed to Cairano. Again about 1505 the rebuilding of the church of San Pietro in Oliveto began, a commission probably won by Sanmicheli. Note that the reliefs are the only figurative works there, in addition to the fine carvings on pilasters and frames of the chapels, a specialism of the Sanmicheli that no longer met contemporary tastes. The ultimate answer from Gasparo not long in coming: with the ark of Sant'Apollonio of 1508, he established once and for all his artistic superiority, which was by then certainly much more preferred by the Brescian clientele. Around this time, perhaps because of the great and definitive works from Cairano, the Sanmicheli left Brescia, never to return. In Casale Monferrato, Bartolomeo died two years later. Matteo, who started alongside his father, continued and ended his career in Piedmont, near Turin, where he left many of his better known works. =Relations with Tamagnino= A similar, strong competition was established very probably between Gasparo Cairano and Antonio della Porta (Tamagnino), who debuted in Brescia (in documentary terms) along with Cairano with his cycle of twelve Angels for the first dome of the Santa Maria dei Miracoli, between 24 December 1489 and May 3, 1490. It is not clear what brought this Milanese artist to Brescia. He belonged to a family of sculptors, and between 1484 and 1489 was known to have worked in Milan and Pavia for the Sforza, in close contact with Giovanni Antonio Amadeo. His debut as a figurative sculptor at the Santa Maria dei Miracoli, however, owed to the Sanmicheli, who typically specialized in the field of decorative sculpture and lacked outside of this field. Note that Gasparo Cairano himself also first appeared on the art scene as a figurative sculptor under the Sanmicheli: he created his sequence of twelve Apostles at the same project. The colocation of the Angels and Apostles as well as the affinity between them suggest that both Tamagnino and Cairano obtained early ownership of the internal works at the Santa Maria dei Miracoli, though at the end, it devolved to Cairano. Technically, however, the Angels of Tamagnino are far superior to the Apostles. In addition to the Angels, Tamagnino also delivered four busts for the pendentive of the first dome of the church, titled Dottori della Chiesa,Historical sources for the attribution of these works are not unanimous. The Martinengo memorial of 1731 (see Guerrini 1930, pp. 189‚Äì218) ascribe the three medallions of St. Ambrose, St. Augustine and St. Jerome to Tamagnino, while Sala (see Sala, p. 90.) attributes the fourth, San Gregorio, although critical stylistic analysis excludes it. See also Zani 2010, p. 98, note 59, and p. 121. and two smaller roundels for the frieze of the nave. But for these constructions, three of which were monumental, and the Angels, the sculptor received a smaller compensation than Cairano did for his Apostles.Gasparo Cairano is paid nine lire for each statue of the Apostles, for a total of 108 lire, while Tamagnino receives 106 lire for the twelve Angels and the five reliefs. See the transcription by Guerrini 1930, pp. 209‚Äì210. of the lost document in Archivio Storico di Santa Maria dei Miracoli, cart. A, fasc. 3. Tamagnino is known to have left Brescia while the construction of the sanctuary was ongoing, evidently finding his work undervalued and underpaid. The reasons for the bias are unclear, but it is possible that Cairano enjoyed local favour, especially from the directors of the company commissioning the shrine, which allowed him to prevail over Tamagnino despite the latter's technical superiority. Tamagnino then won the prestigious contract for the fa√ßade of the Certosa of Pavia, to be installed under the aegis of Father Amedeo and Antonio Mantegazza. The corporate pact between the artist and the two sculptors strengthened in May 1492, providing Tamagnino with a unique training experience as well as a remarkable leap in his career. In 1499 the Duchy of Milan was conquered by the French, causing a diaspora of artists from the city to all of northern Italy and beyond. Perhaps this is the reason for the return of Tamagnino to Brescia. A tantalising project was the commission of the Palazzo della Loggia, in which he participated between November 1499 and June 1500. Sculptural works that had begun at the Loggia in 1492, when Tamagnino had left Brescia, were now the hegemony of Gasparo Cairano, for some years considered as a court sculptor by the Brescian grandees, both public and private. The two artists, therefore, a decade after their mutual debut, now returned to compete for the most prestigious commission in Brescia of the moment. Tamagnino's qualification, almost unique, was to have performed much of the decoration on the marble facade of the Certosa of Pavia, while Gasparo Cairano leveraged a spectacular leap of artistic quality, which had already produced the first Caesars at the public Palazzo. Extant documentation makes it possible to follow the competition more clearly than in the case of the shrine dei Miracoli, and the delivered works, their dates and respective payments lend themselves to interesting analyses. By Tamagnino's arrival in 1499, Cairano already had delivered at least five different Caesars and other stone material, but only a payment for a single bust is documented, because his attention was completely taken up with two gigantic angular trophies that he had recently begun. In November 1499, Tamagnino delivered four Caesars and three leonine busts, which showcased his calibre and scale of production. But in the following seven months, Cairano records successive advances and balances for trophies in full production mode that does not affect his other works, whereas Tamagnino only realises two Caesars and seventeen leonine busts. The creation of leonine busts was considered repetitive and could be consigned to low calibre stonecutters, and Tamagnino was paid much less than the average payment received by Cairano for artefacts of the same type.By way of comparison, note that twenty soldi made a Venetian lira; on May 27, 1500, Tamagnino was paid forty-five soldi (just over two lire each) for his eight leonine protome. For the same artefacts, Gaspare da Carsogna, a stonecutter, received three lire each, Iacopo Campione received two lire, and Girolamo di Canonica got three lire, while Gasparo Cairano was paid eight lire for each protome virile delivered. This information comes from Baldassare Zamboni, Collectanea de rebus Brixiae, Biblioteca Queriniana, Ms. H. III. M. 2. Tamagnino's six Caesars were relegated to the less frequented areas of the building - at the back and the south and west. The sixth bust was of poorer quality than the rest of the cycle, and it is surmised that Tamagnino aimed to taunt his clients who for the second time in Brescia had undervalued his ability and underestimating his work. After these events, Tamagnino abandoned Brescia, probably never to return, leaving Cairano as the main sculptural worker in the city. Critical oblivion Portrait of Pomponio Gaurico, the first scholar to commend Cairano's oeuvre during the artist's life, in 1504 Despite the modernity and the merit of the works produced and the ability of its protagonists, the historiography of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia was never able to win the honors of artistic and literary culture, neither at the time, nor in the following centuries, being forgotten even by the local sources. The main cause is to be found in a long series of errors and omissions that occurred in the critical literature from the earliest days until the twentieth century, which led to the misunderstanding of the cultural level and quality achieved by the Brescia school during the thirty years from the turn of the fifteenth century, and the oblivion of its main characters. The main contributor to the critical oblivion was the loss of archival documentsIn particular, the records of the City of Brescia related to the construction site of the Loggia have been lost, as also the archive of the church of Santa Maria dei Miracoli, the entire documentation of the construction site of San Pietro in Oliveto, the details of the commission of the Martinengo mausoleum, and the ark of Sant'Apollonio and the papers of the Caprioli family. There are many different reasons as to the loss of each archive: see the bibliography cited in support of individual works of art. or, indeed, the artwork itself, often dismembered if not destroyed. Only in the second half of the twentieth century, supported by new studies and the rediscovery of archival sources, has the mastery of Gasparo Cairano been revealed. While a catalog of his works of art has been reconstructed within the framework of the Renaissance in Brescia, the full story still suffers from gaps and there are still events to be clarified. Works Cairano's career covers just over two decades (circa 1490‚Äì1510), a relatively short period, during which, moreover, the majority of works produced is concentrated in the latter decade. Among these, nearly three-quarters are religious commissions, executed mainly because of the greater funding available from such sources and the increased likelihood of their conservation over time. Numerous sculptures also stemmed from private commissions, especially funerary tombs, as well as secular cycles such as that of the Caesars. In many works, there is an evident, and sometimes overwhelming architectural component that indicates the careful preparations made by Cairano in this field. Cairano was lauded, as for example by the municipality of Chiari where he was explicitly named lapicida architectum et ingeniarum optimum. The fair amount of isolated fragments and sculptures testify to the many lost works and those that reached us only incompletely, which were clearly of considerable artistic merit.

The rich material obtained allowed him to revise the New Guinean endemic genus Novopsocus (Pseudocaeciliidae) and to describe the two new species Novopsocus magnus and Novopsocus caeciliae, by comparison with specimens of the Australian Museum lent by Courtenay Smithers (previous authors had mistaken males of N. magnus for males of the type species Novopsocus stenopterus, whilst N. caeciliae had never been found before). Cu√©noud also had a minor part in the Ibisca project (\\"Investigating the Biodiversity of Soil and Canopy Arthropods\\"), an ambitious scientific programme led by Bruno Corbara, Maurice Leponce, Hector Barrios and Yves Basset (with the initial support of Edward O.

Life and work Hester Sainsbury's parents were Harrington Sainsbury (1853-1936), court physician to Queen Victoria, and Maria Tuke (1861‚Äì1947). They married in Marylebone parish church, London on 26 March 1889; Hester was born in the spring of 1890. She grew up among artists such as Roger Fry, Gwen Raverat and the Omega Workshop Group. Her brother Phillip was one of the founders of the Favil Press, and later ran the Cayme Press, for both of which she illustrated several books. She was trained in modern dance by Margaret Morris. Around 1914-1915, she ran a group \\"formed to speak and act her amazingly vital rhythmic verse-plays\\", influencing the development of artistic drama in Britain, and inspiring people such as the artist Maxwell Armfield. Her group was known before the war as the Clarissa Club, which she and another dancer, Kathleen Dillon founded and ran at 71 Royal Hospital Road, Chelsea. By 1914 its name had changed to the Choric School. The whole of the October 1915 issue of Others magazine was devoted to \\"The Choric School\\", with contributions by Sainsbury and the poets Ezra Pound, Kathleen Dillon and John Rodker. Sainsbury became a successful artist and print-maker in the 1920s, being known among other things for using an engraving tool that cut multiple parallel lines rather than the usual one. She made fine art prints and illustrations by engraving both copper and wood. The author Philip Neil describes her engravings as \\"fresh, supple, and irresistibly charming.\\" She lived the Bohemian life of an artist; her lover was the Japanese playwright Kori Torahiko between 1917 and 1926, when he died. She married the Vorticist painter Frederick Etchells on 13 May 1932; she illustrated a number of books for his company, Haslewood Books. She and Etchells moved away from London's artistic scene to France House, East Hagbourne, Oxfordshire, which he personally restored. , In the 1930s she and Etchells purchased a weekend cottage in West Challow then called Holme Lea, a Queen Anne property.

Watts was the first surgeon of African American ancestry in North Carolina. Earning his medical degree in 1943 from Howard University College, he was the first African American board certified surgeon to serve in North Carolina. After surgical training at Freedman's Hospital in Washington, D.C. in 1949, he moved to Durham, North Carolina in 1950 and established a clinic to provide access to medical services for the poor. Breaking the social customs of racial obstacles, he advocated for certification of African American medical students. He also became a member of many professional colleges including the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine and the American College of Surgeons. He served as chief of surgery at Durham's Lincoln Hospital and was later one of the key figures in converting it to the Lincoln Community Health Center, a low-priced clinic for the poor.  Early life and education  Charles DeWitt Watts was born on September21, 1917, to parents who were church members in Atlanta, Georgia. He was the youngest of four children. His father owned a country store consisting of a butcher shop and a fruit store. The parents taught their children the importance of hard work. Watt's daughter, Constance Eileen Watts Welch, later said \\"It was his work with the butcher that taught him the anatomy of animals before formally studying it, when he made steaks and roasts‚Ä¶\\". Since his father had six sisters who desired to attend college, his father was not able to complete his studies in college; however, he urged his children to attain \\"academic excellence without excuse\\". Watts was selected to attend Atlanta University Laboratory High School, a school created for exceptional students who were college bound, located at Spelman College's campus. He then enrolled at Morehouse College where during his first year his father died. At that time, he and his brother worked a paper route, delivering copies of the Atlanta Constitution every morning to support their education. Watts was encouraged to attend medical school by his Morehouse College biology teacher, Samuel Nabrit, as he was good at science subjects, especially biology. Watts received a degree in mathematics in 1938 from Morehouse College. After working at the Washington, D.C., post office to support his education, Watts attended Howard University College of Medicine.  Career  Watts received his medical degree in 1943 from Howard University College of Medicine and become the first African American in North Carolina to become a board certified surgeon. After graduation, he moved to Washington, D.C. and completed surgical training at Freedman's Hospital in 1949, under the tutorship of Charles R. Drew. Drew was credited by Watts for inspiring and encouraging him in his surgical career. Drew was a pioneer of his time for his research on blood and plasma. According to Watts's daughter, \\"It was because of Dr. Drew's encouragement that he went back to Howard... and went through the surgery training program\\". Watts noted in an interview with The Washington Post in 1986 that \\"He [Charles Drew] wanted black doctors to go out and establish themselves around the country\\". The original Lincoln Hospital, at the northwest corner of Proctor and Cozart streets, circa 1901 Between 1948 and 1950, he worked as a surgery instructor at Howard University. In 1950, Watts settled in Durham, N.C. with his wife, Constance Merrick Watts, a native of the town. He opened a private clinic in general surgery for poor people and African Americans, as blacks had very limited access to medical services. In 1965, he was the chief of surgery at the Lincoln Hospital, which was one of the city's few hospitals to serve blacks. The hospital consisted of 150 beds. The hospital was also one of the few hospitals in America at that time which allowed African American doctors to perform surgery. While working as chief of surgery Watts also served as a trainer for the hospital's interns. In the 1970s he played a major role in establishing the Lincoln Community Health Center. In 1975, Watts retired from performing surgery. His daughter said, \\"I also think he was worried about his dexterity and eyesight\\". The front entrance of Lincoln Community Health Center He later become a clinical professor of surgery and director of student health at Duke University Medical School and North Carolina Central University respectively. He also served as a vice president and medical director for 28 years at the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, an insurance company founded by the grandfathers of Constance Merrick Watts. He worked throughout his life to serve medical facilities for the poor and help the black communities, breaking the social custom of racial discrimination when he advocated for the certification of black medical students. One of his former students, Charles Johnson, noted that \\"He [Watts] clearly was a visionary\\" and added that \\"He was a very bright, energetic, capable physician and always (was interested in) helping the black community to whatever extent he could\\". He served as a member of Howard's board of trustees for 19 years, retiring in 1993.  Personal life  Watts married Constance Merrick Watts in 1945. She was a graduate with a major in economics from Talladega College and a community volunteer. A native of Durham, she attended Palmer Memorial Institute. Constance Eileen Watts, later Constance Eileen Watts Welch, was their first child, born March28, 1946 at Lincoln Hospital. They later had three more children: two daughters, Deborah Chase Watts Hill and Winifred A. Watts Hemphill and a son, Charles D. Watts, Jr. After attending Hillside High School, Durham, and earning a B. A. degree from Spelman College, Atlanta, Eileen Watts Welch became an academic administrator. Charles DeWitt Watts, Jr. (\\"Chuck\\"), graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1977, earned MBA and law degrees, and became a law professor, practicing attorney, and community leader. In 1992, Deborah Watts Hill died of breast cancer.  Death  After a career of more than 50 years, Watts died at home aged 86 on July 12, 2004, due to complications from diabetes and heart disease. After a funeral at St. Joseph's AME Church, Fayetteville Street, Durham, he was interred at Beechwood Cemetery, Fayetteville Street, Durham. William Anlyan, former chancellor of Duke University Medical Center for Health affairs, said on hearing of Watts's death, \\"We grew to be great friends [Watts and Anlyan]. He was a well-trained and gentle surgeon, and he and his family became great assets to entire Durham community\\".  Recognition  In 2002, Duke Medical School started a scholarship in his name, the Charles Watts Travel Awards, to \\"assist student and faculty travel to study culturally specific issues.\\" Duke also awarded him an honorary degree. His collected papers are archived at the Duke University Libraries.

It is one of the three Egyptian intelligence services, along with the General Intelligence Directorate and Homeland Security. A number of senior army officers have led the agency, including Field Marshal Abdel-Halim Abu Ghazala, a former defence minister, Gen. Omar Suleiman, the former vice president and former head of the General Intelligence Service, and Major General Murad Muwafi President of the General Intelligence Service, who was appointed successor to Solomon in January / December 2011.Egyptian Military Intelligence (DMI) GlobalSecurity.org Specialties of the agency include reconnaissance to discover enemy movements, collecting information on enemy formations and preparations in wartime and peacetime, and geographical surveys. The agency has also, since the time of Abdul Nasser, conducted an internal mission to detect anti-regime elements within the military. Historically, the agency suffered two major blows: failing to predict the Israeli attack on Egypt in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, and failing to stop the assassination of President Anwar Sadat by Islamists linked to the military in 1981. According to General Mohammad Sadiq (1917-1991), director of intelligence during the 1967 war, the most important reason for the intelligence failure then was the lack of coordination between GID and military intelligence.  Tasks  * Protect the state from any possible attack from the enemy and know the capabilities and military capabilities of the enemy * Planning and coordination with the military police to ensure the security of military facilities and barracks * The level of security control in military installations and security including documents and personnel, weapons and other security * Counter-intelligence * The use of available sources of information to monitor the enemy's military activities * Ensure good discipline and loyalty of officers and individuals * Cooperation with other intelligence agencies in the same state for the exchange of information and complete the tasks, ensuring the achievement of national security  Directors  Major General Zakaria Mohieddin, the first Manager of the Department of military intelligence and reconnaissance 1952 - 1953 *Brigade Staff of War / Zakaria Mohieddin (1952-1953). *Brigade Staff of War / Mohammed Sadiq (1966 - 1969) \\"was promoted to the rank of general and served as Minister of War.\\" *Brigade Staff of War / Mehrez Mustafa (1969-1972). *Brigade Staff of War / Mohamed Abdel Ghani el-Gamasy (1972 - 1972) \\"was promoted to the rank of marshal and served as Minister of War.\\" *Brigade Staff of War / Mohamed Fouad Nassar (1972-1975). *Brigade Staff of War / Labib sharab. *Brigade Staff of War / Emad thabet. *Brigade Staff of War / Mahmoud Abd Allah. *Brigade Staff of War / Abd al-Halim Abu Ghazala (1979 - 1980) \\"was promoted to the rank of marshal and served as Minister of Defense.\\" *Brigade Staff of War / Ahmed Abd El Rahman (1980 - 1986) *Brigade Staff of War / Amin Nimr (1986 -) *Brigade Staff of War / Omar Suleiman (1991-1993). *Brigade Staff of War / Kamal Amer (1994-1997). *Brigade Staff of War / Mohamed Fareed (2004 -). *Brigade Staff of War / Murad Muwafi (2004-2010). *Brigade Staff of War / Abdel Fattah al-Sisi (2010 - 2012) \\"was promoted to the rank of Marshal and served as Minister of Defense.\\" *Brigade Staff of War / Mahmoud Hijazi (2012 - 2014) \\"was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general and is currently the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces.\\" *Brigade Staff of War / Salah Al-Badri (2014‚Äì2015) *Brigade Staff of War / Mohammed Farag El Shahat (2015‚ÄìPresent) See also *General Intelligence Directorate (Egypt) *Homeland Security (Egypt) *Ministry of Defence (Egypt) *Egyptian Armed Forces *Abdel Fattah al-Sisi References Category:1952 establishments in Egypt Category:Government agencies established in 1952 Category:Military of Egypt Category:Military intelligence agencies Category:Egyptian intelligence agencies ","title":"Military Intelligence and Reconnaissance (Egypt)"},{"id":"44616331","text":"ƒΩubom√≠r Gorelƒç√≠k (born 13 March 1997) is a Slovak football forward who currently plays for the Fortuna Liga club M≈†K ≈Ωilina.

Life and career  Nikola Mollov graduated from high school in his hometown of Bourgas, Bulgaria. He obtained his degree in chemistry from the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of Sofia State University in 1951. He became an assistant professor in the Department of Organic Chemistry in 1952 and worked there until 1962. In 1957 he acquired his Ph.D. degree called \\"candidate of chemical sciences\\" and was the first scientist nominated with this title. In 1962, he obtained a senior research fellow II position at the Department of Chemistry of natural organic compounds at the Institute of Organic Chemistry, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (BAS), Sofia where he worked until 1974. N. Mollov was awarded with the title \\"Doctor of chemical sciences‚Äù (D.Sc.) for his outstanding contributions in the area of natural product chemistry summarized in the first doctorate thesis in Bulgaria. In 1974 N. Mollov became a professor in organic chemistry at the Faculty of Chemistry of Plovdiv University \\"Paisiy Hilendarski\\". Under his scientific leadership for 15 years the Department of Chemistry advanced and became one of the leading scientific and educational institutions in the country.  Scientific works  The scientific research of Professor N. Mollov is in the field of natural and synthetic physiologically active substances. Under the supervision of Academician Bogdan Kurtev he developed a new method of organic synthesis which gained popularity as a \\"Reaction of Kurtev and Mollov\\".B. J. Kurtev, N. M. Mollov, M. J. Ljapova, A. S. Orahovats, √úber die Umsetzung von Hydrobenzamid mit Estern der Phenylessigs√§ure in Gegenwart von Aluminiumchlorid, Monatsh. Chem. 1963, Vol. 94, 904-913. In his career as a researcher Prof. N. Mollov worked over 10 years in the field of natural organic compounds of plant origin. He studied the chemical composition of series of Bulgarian plants for alkaloids and diterpene lactones. The department \\"Chemistry of alkaloids\\" at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, headed by Prof. N. Mollov, focussed its main research on the area of isoquinoline alkaloids. A series of plants, common in Bulgaria, were thoroughly investigated for alkaloids. The most important results were obtained for plants belonging to the genera Thalictrum and Fumaria. In Bulgaria, the widely distributed genus was Thalictrum minus, for the alkaloid content of which there were not data available at the time. Other spontaneously growing species were Th. foetidum, Th. simplex and Th. aquilegifolium. The studied plants contained 27 alkaloids, 14 of which were discovered for the first time. Among them: thalmetine, O-methylthalmetine, thalmelatine, thalmelatidine (Thalictrum species) and bulgaramine (Fumaria officinalis). Most important were the benzylisoquinoline-aporphine derivatives, a relatively new group of alkaloids. The results obtained were summarized in a monograph in English, issued by the Publishing House of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.N. M. Mollov, H. B. Dutschewska, V. St. Georgiev, Thalictrum Alkaloids, in \\"Recent Developments in the Chemistry of Natural Carbon Compounds\\" (R. Bognar, V. Bruckner, Cs. Szantay, eds.), Akad√©miai Kiad√≥, Publishing House of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Vol. 4, p. 193 (1971). Significant results were obtained by Prof. Mollov on the study of diterpene lactones in plants of the genus Teucrium (germander).P. Y. Malakov, G. Y. Papanov, N. M. Mollov, Montanin-D, a New Furanoid Diterpene of Clerodane Type from Teucrium montanum L., Z. Naturforsch. 1978, 33b, 1142-1144. These studies were carried out mainly at the Institute of Organic Chemistry of the Academy of Sciences, partly at the Department of Organic Chemistry, University of Plovdiv, with co-workers of Prof. Mollov in the respective departments. The second research area of Prof. N. Mollov was developed during the years 1974 to 1992 mainly in the Department of Organic Chemistry of the University of Plovdiv \\"P. Hilendarski\\" and at the Laboratory of biologically active substances in Plovdiv site of the Academy of Sciences. The results obtained lead to the invention of several amide herbicides such as Alachlor, Dual Gold et al. Consequently, several new laboratory and manufacturing technologies were developed with the participation of co-workers from the R&D; department of \\"Agria\\" chemical plant in Plovdiv. Many new compounds were synthesized with expected pesticide activity that was later confirmed by biological screening in the country and abroad. As a result of all these studies, over 120 scientific papers have been published in national and international scientific journals as well as in 14 author's patents. In addition, these findings were included in 14 Ph.D. dissertations by research fellows and assistant professors as well as many student's thesis. During his work at the Faculty of Chemistry of the University of Plovdiv \\"P. Hilendarski\\" Prof. Mollov worked in collaboration with the Institute of Organic Chemistry (IOCh) of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (BAS) and since 1980 he headed the Laboratory of Biologically Active Substances of IOCh at the BAS site in Plovdiv. He was Associate Dean and Dean of the Faculty of Chemistry in Plovdiv.  Recognition and awards  For his scientific and educational activity Prof. N. Mollov was awarded with many awards and medals. He was nominated with the title \\"Honorary Fellow of Science\\" by the State Council of Bulgaria (1987).

It was formally a joint venture formed by Ligier, and Robosoft Technology PTE Ltd (France). EZ10 was developed with the help ofCityMobil2 project co-funded by the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development (FP7). In January 2017 it was announced that Alstom had invested ‚Ç¨14 million in Easymile and the two companies had signed a commercial partnership agreement. In July 2017, Continental also announced an investment in EasyMile. In July 2019, an EasyMile passenger in Utah required medical attention after falling from a seat due to a sudden stop, prompting the company to put up warning signs and reduce the vehicles' maximum speed. In February 2020, a Smart Columbus (a service in Columbus, Ohio) passengerSelf-driving shuttle company ordered to stop carrying passengers after injury fell from a seat when an EasyMile vehicle executed an emergency stop from . The second incident prompted the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to suspend EasyMile passenger services nationwide (being used in 10 states) while the incident was investigated. Deployments As of end of 2015, the Gelderland county in the Netherlands, plans to put it to use on a 7 km long route between Ede-Wageningen station and the campus of Wageningen University and Research Center. In September 2016, a pilot consisting of a short public transport route served by two EZ10 vehicles started in the village of Appelscha. In December 2016, the EZ10 began use in the first autonomous vehicle passenger shuttle route in North America, looping through Bishop Ranch Office Park in San Ramon, California, operated by First Transit. In 2017, EZ10 was introduced on the grounds of National Taiwan University in Taipei, and in Tallinn, Estonia. In conjunction with Estonia's presidency of the EU Council, the minibus was presented in Tallinn on 14 July 2017 by EasyMile, and the tech companies in Estonia that co-financed the month-and-a-half-long project to bring the shuttle bus to the country. The two buses serve one line officially since 29 July, including a stretch of tram line under reconstruction, and run in the city until the end of August. The line in Tallinn is the first one, where EZ10 buses connect and interact with live traffic.

Definition The term \\"metabolically obese normal weight\\" (MONW) refers to people with normal weight and body mass index (BMI), who display some metabolic characteristics which increase the risk of developing metabolic syndrome in the same way as obesity. People with MONW have excess visceral fat, and are predisposed to hyperinsulinemia, insulin-resistance and thus predisposition to type 2 diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension and premature coronary heart disease or cardiovascular disease. The BMI does not capture information about percentage body fat (PBF), which is a better predictor of risk due to obesity.World Health Organization.

Diagnostic performance of body mass index to identify obesity as defined by body adiposity: a systematic review and metaanalysis. Int J Obes 2010 34(5): 791-9 Some studies have suggested that the main factor which explains the metabolic abnormalities in MONW individuals is fat distribution. On the basis of these studies, a scoring method has been proposed to identify MONW individuals, based on the presence of associated diseases or biochemical abnormalities related to insulin resistance. Prevalence In 2008, the first prevalence of US adults above 20 years was published, based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 1999-2004, finding that 24% of normal-weight adults were metabolically abnormal; on the other hand 51% of overweight adults and 32% of obese adults were metabolically healthy.Wildman RP, Muntner P, Reynolds K, et al.

After graduation he worked as a lawyer. Politics career Ya≈üar Top√ßu entered politics joining the True Path Party (DYP) led by S√ºleyman Demirel. He was elected deputy of Sinop Province in the 1987 general election held on October 29. Following the 1991 general election held on October 20, he was appointed Minister of Transport in the coalition cabinet of Demirel. He served at this position between November 20, 1991 and June 25, 1993. Top√ßu then joined the Motherland Party (ANAP) led by Mesut Yƒ±lmaz. He was re-elected in the 1995 general election on December 24. Top√ßu was appointed once again government minister in the coalition cabinet of Yƒ±lmaz. As Minister of Public Works and Urban Planning, he served from June 30, 1997 until January 11, 1999. During his term of office, the main project he had dealt with was the construction of the Black Sea Coastal Road stretching all the way from west to Sarpi at the Turkish-Georgian border. Planned in the 1960s, the project was started only in 1987 by Prime minister Turgut √ñzal. However, its begin was dated 1988 with the opening of the border to Georgia. The project became soon suspended due to financial problems. It revived after the establishment of the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation in 1992. Prime minister Yƒ±lmaz, a native of Black Sea Region, tasked Top√ßu, also a Black Sea Region native, with the restage of the construction works, which were backed by foreign credits. In the 1999 general election on April 18, he could secure his seat in the parliament for the fourth time. As it became apparent that the tendering was not lawful, a parliamentary committee investigated the case. It concluded that Ya≈üar Top√ßu was involved in bid rigging on tender and abuse of office. The motion to send him before the Constitutional Court () for trial was, however, was rejected in the parliament on June 29, 2000. On January 6, 2004, a new parliamentary investigation committee was formed to reopen the case on allegations against Top√ßu. Worked between April 13 and October 27, 2004, it confirmed the findings of the former committee, and proposed to send Top√ßu before the Constitutional Court on charges of bid rigging. After the acceptance of the related motion in the parliament, the Constitutional Court tried Ya≈üar Top√ßu in time between November 11, 2004 and May 26, 2006. The supreme court found Top√ßu guilty of malpractice, not of bid rigging, for his conduct in the time from August 25 to September 19, 1997 in seven points related to the public tender for the construction of the Black Sea Coastal Road. However, he was freed of imprisonment in accordance with the applicable law, which allows the postponing of the court's final judgement.

Their music traverses the wider spectre of rock, with heavy influences from genres such as krautrock and psychedelic rock, while the lyrics of their songs are almost exclusively written in English. They have released three albums, two of which had an international distribution.  Biography  = The first steps= The members of the band are King Elephant (Yannis Karras), Prins Obi (Yorgos Dimakis, initially under the name Obi Serotone), who is the singer and main lyricist of the band and Sir Kosmiche (Axios Zafirakos). The three childhood friends started playing music together during the last years of highschool under the name Art. Later Karras and Zafirakos were members of the band Duke Abduction for a short period. The three of them met again in 2009 and begun jamming in their own studio and creating musical tracks by sampling and editing the recordings of their jam sessions. The name of the band was inspired by the krautrock band Guru Guru and Captain Beefheart‚Äôs song ‚ÄúElla Guru‚Äù In 2010 they gave a series of live performances in Athens, while they distributed electronically their first EP, Yogi Sister vol. I & vol. ŒôŒô, a collection of their early recordings. =First releases= Their first self-titled work, Baby Guru, was released in September 2011 by the indie label Inner Ear records. An early limited edition print of Baby Guru in vinyl quickly sold out, a sign of the interest that the band had raised. The album's music style bared heavy krautrock influences by bands such as Can and Neu!, with the short length of the tracks however giving them a more pop feel in comparison to the music of the aforementioned bands. Critical reception was relatively positive, highlighting the band's distinct sound in comparison to other contemporary Greek indie groups, however some critics were dismissive of what they considered a stale attachment to the past, while some of the compositions were judged as abstract stylistic exercises. Baby Guru's first work in 2012 was the music for the theater show Why I killed my best friend, an adaptation of a novel with the same title by Amanda Michalopoulou. In June of that year King Elephant released his first solo work titled Under the bed while August saw the free digital release of the EP Covers that contained an intro and three cover songs. Baby Guru's sophomore album, Pieces, was released in October 2012 and it was widely accepted as a significant step forward compared to ‚Äò‚ÄôBaby Guru‚Äô‚Äô. The krautrock influences were still there but this time there were further explorations of the psychedelic rock of the ‚Äò60s and ‚Äò70s, while guitars became a more prominent part of their sound. The album was released in several European countries under distribution by Rough Trade and V2 records, gathering favorable reviews. In the beginning of 2013 the band embarked on a mini tour in the Netherlands to support the local release of Pieces. Towards the end of 2013 Prins Obi released digitally gratis his first solo EP, Love Songs for Instant Success. = Release of ‚Äò‚ÄôMarginalia‚Äô‚Äô = Their third album, titled Marginalia was released in March 2014. The references to krautrock and psychedelia remained, while the band expanded further its music by turning towards new wave and synthpop of the ‚Äò80s. The opening track and first single, \\"Especially when\\", was built around guitar riffs, an unusual choice for the band. Also, for the first time they included a song with Greek lyrics, ‚ÄúExegersis‚Äù. Once again critical acceptance was very positive with many considering it as Baby Guru's best release. The band did extensive touring to support the release of the album. In October 2014 they appeared in the CMJ Music Marathon in New York, where they were hailed as one of the 5 top discoveries of the festival. = Release of ‚Äò‚ÄôSunshine Special‚Äô‚Äô = Following their growing fame and fanbase Sunshine Special was released in Autumn 2015.

History Among the lines built by the Monmouthshire Railway and Canal Company from into the valleys was a branch from to Nantyglo, which was first opened as a tramroad in 1824 branching from the Llanhiledd Tramroad between Crumlin and Beaufort. The first timetabled passenger service ran on 23 December 1850 from to . The line was converted to a railway in 1855 together with other Monmouth tramroads in the area. It became part of the Great Western Railway in 1880 and remained there at the Grouping of 1923. Although the Monmouthshire Railway had established a goods station at Brynmawr by 15 December 1849 via its connection with Joseph and Crawshay Bailey's tramroad at Coalbrook Vale, passenger services were not extended beyond Nantyglo Gate at Blaina. It was only after agreement was reached in June 1858 with the two brothers that the Monmouthshire Railway was authorised to establish a station in their territory. Nantyglo station opened on 16 May 1859 and was the terminus of the line from Aberbeeg until 1906 when the Brynmawr and Western Valleys Railway opened to provide a link with on the London and North Western Railway's Heads of the Valleys line. The link was from a point north of Nantyglo's booking office to a junction with the LNWR line, to the west of Brynmawr station. Although the official opening took place on 30 June 1905, it was not until 28 May 1906 that it was authorised to open. The new line, which was on a 1 in 47 gradient fall towards Nantyglo, was jointly worked by the Great Western and the LNWR, with traffic exchanged between the two companies at Nantyglo. The link created the third route from Newport to Brynmawr, it also being possible to travel via or and the Sirhowy Railway. A single platform was provided for the station which had a small goods yard on the opposite side of the line. Such was the traffic generated during the 1930s that the station had a staff of eleven. To the north of the station was a tall signal box with 20 levers and to the south there was a passing loop. Passenger and goods services were withdrawn from the station on 30 April 1962. The line was progressively shortened as colleries were closed, with official closure of the section between Brynmawr and Coalbrookvale including Nantyglo coming on 4 November 1963. The last section of the route near Abertillery was taken out of use in 1989 after the closure of Six Bells Colliery. Present The A467 road follows the course of the former line through Nantyglo.

He was a pupil of Henri Chapu and Paul Guibe and was the father of Paul, √âlie junior and Henri who were all artists and sculptors. Sadly all three sons lost their lives in the 1914-1918 war. √âlie junior and Paul both joined the 71st Infantry Regiment in August 1914 then moved to the 74th Infantry Regiment, both dying from gas inhalation at Boezinge in Belgium on 22 April 1915. Henri was killed in 1918 in fighting around the Meuse. This article gives details of most of √âlie Le Goff senior's work and also two works by Paul Le Goff. Paul Le Goff was born in Saint-Brieuc on 1 April 1883 and died in 1915, √âlie junior was born in 1881 and Henri was born in 1887. Amongst √âlie senior's works are the composition \\"L'enfant rieur\\", a bust of Villiers l'Isles Adam and several war memorials (\\"monuments aux morts\\"). His son √âlie was a student at the √âcole des Arts d√©coratifs in Paris. His works include \\"Un accident de carri√®re\\" and \\"Les Frileuses\\". His son Paul produced many works including \\"La Synth√®se de l'hiver\\" which won the \\"Roux\\" prize in 1912 and \\"La forme se d√©gageant de la mati√®re\\" which was awarded the \\"Prix Chenavard\\". His son Henri had studied in New York. In Saint-Brieuc one of the main streets carries the name \\"Trois Fr√®res Le Goff\\".  Main works  The following are works attributed to him. = La Chapelle Notre-Dame de la Fontaine = √âlie Le Goff was responsible for the limestone sculptures of Saint Brieuc and Saint Tugdual in this Saint Brieuc church situated in the rue Ruffelet. The original chapel was demolished in 1799 and reconstructed in 1838 by Julie Bagot. Le Goff's two sculptures date to 1896. . =Decoration of the Saint-Laurent parish church in Callac= The capitals of the columns lining the nave of the √âglise paroissiale Saint- Laurent in Callac were by √âlie Le Goff. = Bust of Charles Baratoux = This √âlie Le Goff sculpture can be seen in Saint-Brieuc's Place Baratoux and depicts the ex-mayor Baratoux. Le Goff's sculpture replaced a Jean Boucher sculpture which had been confiscated in 1942 by the Vichy authorities and the bronze melted down for re-use. = Statue of Joan of Arc = This statue, carved from wood, stands in Guingamp's Rue Notre-Dame by the Basilique Notre- Dame de Bon Secours and is a work by √âlie Le Goff based on Princess Marie d'Orl√©ans' model of Joan called \\"Pri√®re avant le combat\\" ('The Prayer before the Battle'). Joan is depicted in a suit of armour and carrying a sword. She is flanked by statues of Saint Catherine and Saint Marguerite. The statue stands on a column with relief panels carved from wood by Le Goff at its base. These reliefs depict:- 1\\\\. \\"Jeanne d'arc ecoutant ses voix\\" - Jeanne d'Arc listening to her voices 2\\\\. \\"Le sacre de Charles vii\\" - Coronation of Charles VII in Reims 3\\\\. \\"Entr√©e triumphale √† Orl√©ans\\" -The triumphal entry into Orl√©ans 4\\\\. \\"Supplice de jeanne d'arc\\" - The execution of Jeanne d'Arc 5\\\\.

The work was completed in 1914. = The tomb of the three Le Goff brothers = √âlie's sons Paul Le Goff and his two brothers were all killed in the 1914-1918 war and are buried in the Saint-Michel cemetery in Saint-Brieuc and √âlie was commissioned to carry out the tomb's decoration. He executed a bronze medallion and in a tribute to Paul, made a granite version of a work in plaster entitled \\"Fun√©railles bretonnes\\" executed by Paul before the start of the war. This moving composition depicts the porch of a chapel from which three generations of Breton women are emerging. They wear mourning clothes. The Saint-Michel cemetery is located in Saint-Brieuc's Rue Jobert de Lamballe. √âlie Le Goff junior was killed in Boezinge in Belgium in 1915, as was Paul Le Goff, whilst Henri Le Goff was killed in 1918 at Les Monthairons in the Meuse.

Soon after Korobeinikis publication, Nikolai Chernyshevsky used one of its fragments, \\"The Song of a Humble Tramp\\" (–ü–µ—Å–Ω—è —É–±–æ–≥–æ–≥–æ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–∞), in his proclamation campaign promoting the idea of the peasant revolution.Chernyshevsky, N.G., The Works of‚Ä¶Vol. VII. Moscow, 1950, p. 874 The same song was quoted by Alexander Hertsen in the February 1, 1862, issue of Kolokol.Hertsen, A.I. The Works of A.I. Hertsen in 30 vols. Vol. XVI, 1959, p.28 The beginning of the poem (its 24 lines) evolved into a well-known folk song \\"Korobushka.Chukovsky, K.I.. Commentaries to Korobeiniki. The Works by N.A.Nekrasov in 8 vol. Khudozhestvennaya Literatura, Moscow. 1967. Vol. II. Pp. 409-410. Storyline ;Part one Ivan, the younger of the two peddlers (korobeinikis) seduces Katerina in the fields at night. The girl who is in love with him, chooses to buy just one turquoise ring, refusing to take any presents. Departing, he promises to marry her on return. ;Part two Ivan and Tikhonych enter another village and get surrounded by the local women fascinated by their goods. The old man proves to be a shrewd bargainer; his younger friend is embarrassed by his ways of holding the price. ;Part three Out of the village and seeing a church, Tikhonych becomes remorseful, ashamed of the lies he had to tell poor women. He blames the war for the dire state of the market, with mothers crying for their soldier sons and having no money for dresses and finery. One line: \\"What's fun and games for the Tsar/Is grief for a common man\\" proved especially controversial: all the pre-1917 editions featured the changed version with —Ü–∞—Ä—å (the Tsar) replaced by –≤—Ä–∞–≥ (vrag, the enemy) ;Part four In the morning the two continue their journey. Again complaining about the poor trade, Tikhonych blames Paris for the way Russian women have suddenly all gone fashion minded (\\"Should you dislike your own nose /They'll glue you another one there,\\" goes one line). ;Part five Katerina works alone in the fields. Pining for Ivan whom she badly wants to marry, she extols her own virtues, including good character and the willingness to do all the hard work for her future husband. ;Part six Looking for a shorter way back to Kostroma the travelers find themselves in the moors. A gloomy looking forest ranger with a gun offers himself as a companion. Having figured out there should be a lot of money with the men whose boxes are empty, he robs and kills them. Later in the village's pothouse he launches a spree and inadvertently lets his story out. The police arrives, the murderer is arrested, the dead bodies are found.Nekrasov, N.A. Korobeiniki.

He has proposed it as a replacement for the JPEG image format as the more compression-efficient alternative in terms of image quality or file size. It is based on the intra- frame encoding of the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) video compression standard. Tests on photographic images in July 2014 found that BPG produced smaller files for a given quality than JPEG, JPEG XR and WebP. The format has been designed to be portable and work in low memory environments, and used in portable handheld and IoT devices, where those properties are particularly important. Current research works on designing and developing more energy- efficient BPG hardware which can then be integrated in portable devices such as digital cameras.U. Albalawi, S. P. Mohanty and E. Kougianos, \\"Energy- Efficient Design of the Secure Better Portable Graphics Compression Architecture for Trusted Image Communication in the IoT\\", in Proceedings of the 15th IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI), 2016, pp. 302--307.U. Albalawi, S. P. Mohanty, and E. Kougianos, ‚ÄúA Hardware Architecture for Better Portable Graphics (BPG) Compression Encoder‚Äù, in Proceedings of the 1st IEEE International Symposium on Nanoelectronic and Information Systems, 2015, pp. 291-296. While there is no built-in native support for BPG in any mainstream browsers, websites can still deliver BPG images to all browsers by including a JavaScript library written by Bellard.  High Efficiency Video Coding and BPG  HEVC already has several profiles defined for still-picture coding using HEVC's intra-frame encoding for various bit depths and color formats, including the progressively more capable Main Still Picture, Main 4:4:4 Still Picture, and Main 4:4:4 16 Still Picture profiles. BPG is essentially a wrapper for uses of the HEVC's Main 4:4:4 16 Still Picture profile up to 14 bits per sample.  Specifications  BPG's container format is intended to be more suited to a generic image format than the raw bitstream format used in HEVC (which is otherwise ordinarily used within some other wrapper format, such as the .mp4 file format). BPG supports the color formats known as 4:4:4, 4:2:2, and 4:2:0. Support for a separately coded extra channel is also included for an alpha channel or the fourth channel of a CMYK image. Metadata support is included for Exif, ICC profiles, and XMP. Color space support is included for YCbCr with ITU-R BT.601, BT.709, and BT.2020 (non-constant luminance) definitions, YCgCo, RGB, CMYK, and grayscale. Support for HEVC's lossy and lossless data compression is included. BPG supports animation. Patents According to Bellard's site BPG may be covered by some of the patents on HEVC, but any device licensed to support HEVC will also be covered for BPG. Patent issues may prevent JPEG replacement by BPG despite BPG's better technical performance. Other proposed JPEG replacements Several previous image formats have also been proposed as JPEG replacements, including: * AVIF, image format based on the AV1 video codec * FLIF * HEIF, another container for HEVC intra-frames * JPEG 2000 * JPEG XL * JPEG XR * WebP, image format based on VP8 References  External links  * * BPG ‚Äì image comparison Category:Graphics file formats Category:Image compression Category:Open formats Category:Computer-related introductions in 2014 ","title":"Better Portable Graphics"},{"id":"44616764","text":"James Guy Usher (May 9, 1883 - June 16, 1944) was an American film actor.

It specialises in the fields of chamber opera and music theatre, and produces rarely performed works from the Baroque era to the present. It is a member of the Opera and Music Theatre Forum. New Chamber Opera has received financial support from the Arts Council of Great Britain and The National Lottery.  History  New Chamber Opera was founded in 1990 by Michael Burden and Gary Cooper. Burden serves as its director. The company has staged more than thirty productions, including Handel's Orlando, Serse and Amadigi di Gaula, Cimarosa's The Secret Marriage and Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro and Il R√® pastore.\\"Music in Oxford \\". Peter Schofield, British Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies. Reviewed: 19 July 2012 The company has an associated Baroque orchestra, The Band of Instruments. Appearances outside Oxford have included concerts and productions at the Tudeley and Southwark Festivals, several performances at London's South Bank Centre, and at the National Gallery. With its contemporary music ensemble Phoenix, it has performed several pieces of twentieth-century music theatre including Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire, Peter Maxwell Davies's Eight Songs for a Mad King, Vessalii Icones, Notre Dames des Fleurs, and Miss Donnithorne's Maggot, and Harrison Birtwistle's Down by the Greenwood Side. New Chamber Opera has frequently recovered and performed lesser known works, particularly those of the 17th, 18th, and early 19th centuries. To this end its members have prepared new editions and commissioned new translations. In 2008 and 2009, New Chamber Opera took part in a national fundraising campaign led by the Bodleian Library, Oxford, to prevent the only known manuscript of the English version of Francesco Cavalli's opera, Erismena, from being exported to the United States.\\"The earliest opera in English saved for the nation: The Bodleian library acquires Erismena\\", Bodleian Library website, 16 January 2009. Retrieved 30 August 2016. New Chamber Opera subsequently staged the opera using a new edition by Michael Burden, and toured the production to the Opera at West Green House. Its music director is Steven Devine, and its singing patron is James Bowman.  Activities  The cast of Paisiello's \\"Il Barbiere di Siviglia\\", 2017 The focus of the company's professional activities is the Summer Opera, an annual garden staging in the Warden's Garden at New College. The garden, a natural theatrical space surrounded by stone walls with an 18th- century stone summer house, is located between Queen's Lane and All Souls College. The Band of Instruments, founded by Michael Burden and Gary Cooper in 1995, first performed with the Choir of New College, Oxford. In 2014 the Band's musical director is Roger Hamilton, and its leader is Caroline Balding.  Recordings  New Chamber Opera's recordings have mostly appeared on the Gaudeamus label, with Academy Sound and Vision. These include music by Purcell from the Gresham Manuscript, and Music for Ceremonial Oxford. It has frequently recorded French Baroque music, recording stage music from Charpentier's output, and the only complete recording of Rameau's cantatas. The Band of Instruments have also recorded the cycle of the four seasons concertos by the Italian composer Giovanni Antonio Guido, Scherzi armonici sopra le quattro stagioni dell‚Äôanno (‚ÄòHarmonics above the four seasons of the year‚Äô). Guido, who was serving as ma√Ætre de la musique for the Duke of Orl√©ans, had been living and working in France from about 1703.

The voice actors include Jerry Stiller, Sean Hayes, Kevin Michael Richardson, Jason Alexander, John Ratzenberger and Dennis Haysbert. Reiss, a writer and producer of The Simpsons who sought to bring a \\"Simpsons sensibility to Christmas specials,\\" adapted the script from his 2000 children's book of the same name and its 2002 sequel Santa Claustrophobia, which were both illustrated by David Catrow. The special premiered on December 5, 2014, on NBC. It was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics. Plot A quaint little town called Stinky Cigars, a secret location hidden only by a name that was chosen to repel tourists, is populated by iconic holiday characters from every culture around the world. It is home to Santa Claus and his workshop full of hard- working elves, and to other holiday figures from the best-known (Cupid, the Easter Bunny, George Washington and Abraham Lincoln) to the most minor and obscure (Arbor Day Aardvark, Labor Day Amos). The story, which is narrated in verse and \\"cheekily punctuated\\" by original songs, centers on Edison Elf (Sean Hayes), an optimistic inventor with an unexpectedly hazardous new toy, and Murray Weiner (Jerry Stiller), the cranky owner of the town's diner. Murray's talent for delivering orders makes the unwilling curmudgeon the only person in town who can fill in for an injured Santa (Kevin Michael Richardson) on Christmas Eve. Cast * Jerry Stiller as Murray Weiner * Sean Hayes as Edison Elf * Kevin Michael Richardson as Santa Claus and Easter Bunny * Jason Alexander as Doc Holiday * John Ratzenberger as Officer Bender * Dennis Haysbert as the Baby New Year and the Narrator * Nick Jameson, Tom Kenny, Maurice LaMarche, Tress MacNeille and Billy West as various characters Reception The special received 3.57 million viewers and a 0.9/3 rating/share. How Murray Saved Christmas received mixed reviews from critics. The review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the special a score of 50% based on reviews from 6 critics, with an average score of 3.7/10. The review-aggregation website Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 60 out of 100 based on 4 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Patrick Kevin Day of the Los Angeles Times gave the special a positive review, saying \\"It's the kind of special that harried parents may want to turn on for their own tired parents to help babysit the kids. They'll enjoy the extended tribute to milkmen.\\" Robert Bianco of USA Today gave the special a positive review, saying \\"The very multicultural Murray is one of those rare holiday specials the entire family can enjoy for years to come.\\" Brian Lowry of Variety gave the special credit for delivering on its \\"snarky promise\\" by bringing the Simpsons style to Christmas specials: > Playfully irreverent ... and clearly pitched to tickle adults along with > kids, Murray features such moments as a sprightly elf ditty with the lyrics: > \\"We never miss a day of work, 'cause we don't have health insurance.\\" Nor > are the tots likely to get throwaway gags like a store named Salvador's > Dollies. Nevertheless, Lowry gave the special a negative review, stating that \\"at the risk of sounding like a Grinch, while Murray gets the sleigh off the ground, How Murray Saved Christmas doesn't manage to stay airborne.\\" Erik Adams of The A.V. Club gave the special a C+, saying \\"Sentiment- and story-wise, How Murray Saved Christmas is all over the place, but its joke-telling abilities live up to the shiniest lines on its creators' resumes.\\" Awards Composer Walter Murphy and writer/lyricist Mike Reiss were nominated for a 2015 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics for How Murray Saved Christmas. Release How Murray Saved Christmas was released on DVD on December 16, 2014.

Battle On 3 December, ISIL launched an offensive in the direction of the Deir Ezzor military airbase. They reportedly managed to capture the al-Masemekeh Building after a suicide bomber detonated a car near it, killing 19 soldiers and NDF fighters, according to the SOHR. In the clashes that followed, 7 ISIL militants were killed, while ISIL seized two tanks, an APC, an artillery piece, and machine guns. The next day, ISIL reportedly advanced further and captured al-Mari'iyah village, and they also captured parts of the al-Jafra village, while the Syrian Army reported that the 104th Airborne Brigade of the Republican Guard Killed over 20 ISIL militants, and seized 3 tanks. The same source named 17 ISIL casualties in from fighting in the al-Mari‚Äôayyi area. The SAF conducted ten airstrikes on ISIL positions that day. On 5 December, ISIL captured al-Jafra village. 37 ISIL militants and 30 soldiers were killed during the takeover. Meanwhile, 15 ISIL fighters were killed by coalition warplanes targeting a convoy in the al- Bokamal countryside. Later that day, the Syrian Army launched a counterattack and recaptured parts of al-Mari'iyah village, and regained control of the perimeter of the Deir-ez Zour airbase from ISIL The Syrian Army claimed that it had killed over 100 ISIL militants since the start of the ISIL offensive, while SOHR gave the number of 45. ISIL also managed to capture some positions and military equipment on the mountain overlooking the city. During the early morning of 6 December, ISIL took control of the missiles battalion to northeast of the airport. At the same time, ISIL detonated a car-bomb at the main gate of the air base and managed to advance into the base, but this attack was eventually repelled due to heavy shelling and bombardment by the Army. ISIS also pulled back from the mountain overlooking Deir ez Zor after it was exposed to heavy aerial bombardment by the SAF, which reportedly used chlorine gas. Since the start of the offensive, 51 soldiers and 68 ISIS militants were killed, according to SOHR. Al-Masdar reported that over 200 ISIS fighters have been killed along with 43 Army soldiers since the start of the offensive. On 7 December, the military stated that ISIS forces had retreated south of the military airport. Later that day, they also reported that there was no more fighting in the vicinity of the airport. ISIS launched a new attack in an attempt to breach the eastern perimeter of the base. A Saudi suicide car-bomber attempted to crash into the eastern gates and clear the way for ISIS fighters. However, the vehicle was destroyed by government soldiers before he reached his target. The fighting of the evening left 23 ISIS fighters dead, according to a military source. A number of soldiers were captured during the attack, according to the SOHR. On 8 December, a military source reported that ISIS begun to withdraw their forces from al-Jafra. Fighting also continued in al-Mari'iyah. Meanwhile, on the nearby Sakr Island (Hajeewa Sakr), the military reported killing over 70 ISIS militants during the previous three days. On 9 December, ISIS retreated after their attack on Deir ez-Zor military airport failed, withdrawing to the outskirts of surrounding villages. The Syrian Army launched intensive airstrikes on their strongholds on the outskirts of the villages of al-Jafra, al-Hawija and Marihiyak in order to further secure the airport area and prevent fighters from having a second opportunity at getting close to its walls. On 11 December, government forces regained control of al-Jafra and the points on the mountain. However, later ISIS advanced around al-Jafra and the outskirts of the Hajeewa Sakr area and took control over areas opposite of al-Jafra, linking ISIS-held territory between the two areas. At midnight on 12 December, a suicide bomber driving a tank blew himself up at the eastern wall of the air base, damaging Army fortifications. The tank's approach was not noticed due to the dense morning fog. After that, a car-bomber attempted to reach the airport's gate but his vehicle was destroyed 40 meters from his target. The double bombing attack was followed by a ground attack which was repelled. Later, Syrian troops ambushed a group of ISIS fighters in the al-Jbeila. Also, troops recaptured al-Hwaika after ISIS advanced into it the previous day, while according to a military source the Army had secured 70 percent of al- Mari'iyah, with ISIS still holding positions in the south-eastern perimeter of the town. On 13 December, Syrian troops pushed back another ISIS attack on the military airport. The next day, 200 members of the Shaatat tribe joined to Army at the military air base to fight against ISIS. Meanwhile, fighting continued near the al-Jafra school in an attempt by ISIS to breach the Army defense line. Aftermath On 15 December, the Republican Guard, supported by the Syrian Air Force, reportedly captured several blocks in the vicinity of Deir es-Zor. On 17 December, the Army‚Äôs 104th Airborne Brigade, backed up by the NDF and a local tribe, launched a major counter-offensive northeast of the airport, reportedly taking complete control of 1.5 km of land adjacent to the base. Also, the 137th Brigade of the Army‚Äôs 17th Division captured the area of the Al-Rashidiyyeh Bank. Three days later, a new assault on the air base resulted in the deaths of 20 ISIS militants and eight soldiers, one of whom was a Brigadier General, the commander of the Deir ez-Zor air base. During the fighting ISIS captured a white building on the southeastern edge of the base. Three days later, ISIS captured several other positions near the base and the mountain. In fighting in the Al-Sina'a city district between 25 and 27 December, at least 30 ISIS militants were killed, according to a military source. Meanwhile, ISIS still controlled about 30% of Sakr Island and was being supplied only by boats. On 27 January, the Army captured the Rocket Battalion's base and the Al-Waaqa‚Äôat Farms, north of the air base. They also reportedly recaptured the Observatory Facility in the Abu Bardan area of Sakr Island. This brought 75% of the island under Army control, according to a military source. The fighting left 20 ISIS fighters dead. The next day, the military further advanced and fully secured the village of al-Mari'iyah. In early February, ISIS forces further retreated from several positions east of the air base. Mid-March, the Army captured the salt farm to the south of Deir ez-Zor and advanced to the town of Al-Shulah, with more than 35 ISIS fighters being killed. Also, at the end of the month, the Army captured the area of the Electrical Facility, near the Al-Taym Oil Fields, and, backed up by a local tribe, the village of Al-Malha, east of the city.

It is a forage crop and cover crop used in the tropics. It is known as puero in Australia and tropical kudzu in most tropical regions. It is closely related to other species in the genus Pueraria and it is crossable with the other species of Pueraria. Name The name kudzu does not only refer to P. phaseoloides. It is also used for its close relatives Pueraria montana and P. edulis. P. phaseoloides has different scientific synonyms. Depending on the authors, it is possible that two different variation are citied: P. phaseoloides var. phaseoloides and the bigger and larger P. phaseoloides var. javanica. Distribution Distribution of Pueraria Phaseoloides. Pueraria phaseoloides is indigenous in east or in southeast Asia. Today it has been introduced and naturalized in a broad range of other wet tropical environments: Africa, Americas and Australia. P. phaseoloides prefers to is grow in ruderal situations, such as plantations of cocoa or banana, at low altitudes (often under 600 metres above sea level) in wet evergreen or monsoon forests. P. phaseoloides is capable to growth in a large soil spectrum. Acid soils are not a problem and the pH tolerance is between 4.3 and 8. Description Pueraria phaseoloides is a deep rooting perennial herb, building a subtuberus. This device allows to resist waterlogged soils and short periods of drought. The above ground structure can grow up to 30 cm at day and often the steams can reach 20 m of elongation. P. phaseoloides is a twiner and climbs over other plants or anthropogenic objects. The leaves are large and trifoliate, typical for Leguminosae. The single leaflets can have an oval or triangular shape. Their dimensions can vary from 2 x 2 cm to 20 x 15 cm. The growing season goes from early spring to late fall in the subtropics and year round in the tropics. Flowers are typical for the Fabales order. The colour ranges from mauve to purple and the dimensions are small and occur in scattered pairs on a raceme. Mature pods of P. phaseoloides show a black color and hair coat. They are straight or slightly curved and can be sized from 4 to 11 cm. Each pod contains 10-20 seeds. They have a particular squarish form with rounded corner (3 x 2 mm) and have also a black or brown colour. =Biology= Pueraria phaseoloides seeds The reproduction of Pueraria phaseoloides can be vegetative or generative. P. phaseoloides shows an epigeal germination. The growth from seedling is in the first three or four months moderately vigorous. Contrarily to Pueraria montana var. lobata, P. phaseoloides does not have a dormant period. Successful growth was observed with a temperature between 22.1 and 27.4 ¬∞C, colder environment drastically reducing the development. After establishment, the plant starts to climb and build tangled mats of over a half meter. It was found that the production of seeds is improved by the possibility to climb. The relatively reduced shade tolerance of P. phaseoloides explain of this phenomenon. Developed plants can also reproduce vegetatively. When vines are in contact with the soil, a new plant can grow from the nodes. This enlarges and forms new crowns with 3 -4 vines each. The conjunction with the parental plant is kept until the second growing season. =Genetics= Pueraria phaseoloides is a diploid species. Depending on the source, the cytological characteristics show different results. The diploid number is probably 20 or 22. Some authors found also 24 chromosomes, this results is disputable. =Invasiveness= Pueraria phaseoloides can become an invasive species when growing in tropical and subtropical habitats due to its fast growth, its wide seed distribution and its ability to fully cover other plants. P. phaseoloides is one of the most invasive species in the United States. Use Pueraria phaseoloides is grown as a cover crop (often with centro and calopo ) in oil palm, rubber and coconut. The main advantages of using P. phaseoloides as a cover crop is the comparable high nitrogen accumulation and the improvement of the soil structure due to its deep rooting system. It can be used as a grazed forage crop and as green manure in crop rotations. Furthermore, it can be used to prevent soil erosion on sloppy soils. In Africa it is mainly used as cover crops in plantations whereas in tropical America, south-east Asia it is used as forage crop in mixtures and as cover crops. In Malaysia its extracts are used as medicine. Production As P. phaseoloides is used as cover crop or as part of a mixture in pastures. Its production methods differ for both uses. =Propagation= Pueraria phaseoloides is mainly propagated by drill sowing, where the distance between the drill rows is set to one metre. Furthermore, it can be hand planted or propagated by cutting. For increased germination and sanitary protection a hot water treatment (50 ¬∞C ‚Äì 70 ¬∞C) can be applied. For soil cover or green manure use, P. phaseoloides is normally sown with a sowing density of 4.0 kg seed per ha, which is similar to 32 ‚Äì 35 seeds per m2, depending of the seed weight. When sowing pastures with a high weed pressure the number of seed can reach up to 70 seeds per m2 when there is a high weed pressure. When used in mixture P. phaseoloides is sown with a density of 1.5 - 2.0 kg per ha, which is equal to 12 ‚Äì 18 seeds per m2. =Nutrient requirement= The nutrient requirement of P. phaseoloides was first discussed by Dirven and Ehrencron in 1969. They found that good root development is attained under presence of P, Mg and Ca. Furthermore, they found the highest yield reduction under low P conditions followed by low Ca and Mg conditions whereas at low K, N and Na conditions yield was 50 percent lower. As a legume P.phaseoloides can compensate for low N conditions by increasing symbiotic nitrogen fixation. This also explains its well response to added P. On poor soils 100 kg of P2O5 showed to bring benefital effect on the yield. The Inoculation of the seeds before sowing with Bradyrhizobium is advised for primary cultivated areas. =Diseases= There are some diseases present in P. phaseoloides. However, the severity of this diseases is on P. phaseoloides is low. The most important diseases are leaf spot (Pseudocercospora puerariae) and anthracnose (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides). They mainly appear under prolonged humid and warm conditions. =Water stress= Pueraria phaseoloides is not drought tolerant. However it was reported that P. phaseoloides can survive short dry periods. This drought susceptibility is a problem as soon as grown in Tropical savanna climate with wet and dry seasons. =Management when used in mixtures= The management of P. phaseoloides grown in mixtures is challenging. P. phaseoloides often shows a high palatability compared to tropical grasses; hence under high grazing pressure it can disappear. If the grazing pressure is too low it can dominate due to its fast growth and its climbing ability. Its growth is also affected by the other species in the mixture. It grows well with ori, molasses, guinea and napier grass. However it cannot persist when grown with Brachiaria decumbens or pangola grass. =Harvesting= When used as a forage crop P. phaseoloides is mainly grazed. Cutting for hay, silage, barn betting is possible as well. When used as a green manure kudzu is directly incorporated into the soil. Harvesting of the seeds can be done by hand or with harvesting machines. When grown as monoculture the yield of P. phaseoloides can reach up to 10 tons dry matter per ha, whereas the biggest proportion of the yield is produced during wet season. The yield of mixtures with P. phaseoloides can reach up to 23 tons per ha when grown under optimal conditions. The seed yield can reach up to 330 kg per ha under optimal conditions. The optimum seed yield can only be attained when harvested by hand. If the seeds are harvested with a machine the harvested yield it is noticeably lower. This is due to uneven maturity of the seed pots and therefore high shattering. Breeding There is no breeding done with P. phaseoloides. However, there is some seed traded especially in Australia. There is one germplasm collection in Columbia (CIAT ) and one in Australia (CSIRO ). Nutrient Content Pueraria phaseoloides shows a high protein content in the seeds (12-20%). Also the nutrient, protein (3.8%) and sugar (7.3%) content of the whole fresh plant (green part) is very high. This is especially true when compared to other tropical plant species. Due to its rich nutrient content P.phaseoloides has a good feeding value. 100g of P. phaseoloides contain 1880 kJ of energy, of which a big share is available as metabolic energy. Differentiation from other species Pueraria phaseoloides is similar to its close relative P. montana and P. edulis. It can be distinguished from P.montana when comparing their tubers. P. phaseoloides produces really small tubers whereas the tubers of P. montana are big and edible.

One of the main goal in compressed sensing is the recovery process. Generally speaking, recovery process in compressed sensing is a method by which the original signal is estimated using the knowledge of the compressed signal and the measurement matrix.D. L.

Mathematically, the recovery process in Compressed Sensing is finding the sparsest possible solution of an under-determined system of linear equations. Based on the nature of the measurement matrix one can employ different reconstruction methods. If the measurement matrix is also sparse, one efficient way is to use Message Passing Algorithms for signal recovery. Although there are message passing approaches that deals with dense matrices, the nature of those algorithms are to some extent different from the algorithms working on sparse matrices.Chandar, Venkat, Devavrat Shah, and Gregory W. Wornell. \\"A simple message-passing algorithm for compressed sensing.\\" Information Theory Proceedings (ISIT), 2010 IEEE International Symposium on. IEEE, 2010.  Overview  The main problem in recovery process in CS is to find the sparsest possible solution to the following under- determined system of linear equations Ax = y where A is the measurement matrix, x is the original signal to be recovered and y is the compresses known signal. When the matrix A is sparse, one can represent this matrix by a bipartite graph G=(V_l\\\\cup V_r,E) for better understanding.Indyk, Piotr. \\"Explicit constructions for compressed sensing of sparse signals.\\" Proceedings of the nineteenth annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete algorithms.

These messages are different for variable nodes and check nodes. However, the basic nature of the messages for all variable node and check nodes are the same in all of the verification based message passing algorithms. The messages \\\\mu^{v}(v_i):~V_l \\\\mapsto \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\times \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\} emanating from variable node v_i contains the value of the check node and an indicator which shows if the variable node is verified or not. Moreover, the messages \\\\mu^{c}(c_i):~V_r \\\\mapsto \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\times \\\\mathbb{Z}^+ emanating from check node c_i contains the value of the check node and the remaining degree of the check node in the graph. In each iteration, every variable node and check node produce a new message to be transmitted to all of its neighbors based on the messages that they have received from their own neighbors. This local property of the message passing algorithms enables them to be implemented as parallel processing algorithms and makes the time complexity of these algorithm so efficient.F. Zhang and H. D. Pfister, ‚ÄúOn the iterative decoding of high-rate LDPC codes with applications in compressed sensing,‚Äù arXiv preprint arXiv:0903.2232, 2009.  Message passing rulesLuby, Michael G., and Michael Mitzenmacher. \\"Verification-based decoding for packet-based low-density parity-check codes.\\" IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 51.1 (2005): 120-127.  The common rule between all verification based message passing algorithms is the fact that once a variable node become verified then this variable node can be removed from the graph and the algorithm can be executed to solve the rest of the graph. Different verification bases message passing algorithms use different combinations of verification rules. The verification rules are as follows: * Zero Check Node (ZCN): If there is at least one check node with value zero in the neighborhood of a variable node then this variable node should be verified with value zero * Degree 1 Check Node: (D1CN): If there is one or more check nodes with degree 1 in the neighborhood of a variable node, then the variable node should be verified with the value chosen randomly from the value of those degree 1 check nodes. * Equal Check Node: (ECN): If there is a single variable node connected to at least two or more check nodes with the same non-zero value then the value of the variable node should be verified with the common value of those check nodes. Besides, every other variable nodes that are partially connected to these check nodes (not all of them) should be verified with value zero. The message passing rules given above are the basic and only rules that should be used in any verification based message passing algorithm. It is shown that these simple rules can efficiently recover the original signal provided that certain conditions are satisfied.  Algorithms  There are four algorithms known as VB-MPA's, namely Genie, LM, XH, and SBB. All of these algorithms use the same strategy for recovery of the original signal; however, they use different combination of the message passing rules to verify variable nodes. = Genie Algorithm = Genie algorithm is the benchmark in this topic. Firstly, Genie algorithm is assumed to have the knowledge of the support set of the signal, i.e. the set of non-zero elements of the original signal. Using this knowledge, Genie should not care about the zero variable nodes in the graph, and the only task of the Genie algorithm is to recover the values of the non-zero elements of the original signal. Although, Genie does not have any practical aspect, it can be regarded as the benchmark of the problem especially in the sense that this algorithm outperforms other algorithms in this category and one can measure how successful one algorithms is by comparing that to the Genie algorithm. Since Genie only wants to find the value of the non-zero elements of the signal it is not necessary to employ rules that are responsible for zero valued variable node in this algorithm. Therefore, Genie only uses D1CN as the verification rule. = LM algorithm = This algorithm unlike the Genie algorithm does not have any knowledge about the support set of signal, and it uses D1CN and ZCN together to solve the recovery process in CS. In fact, ZCN is the rule that attempts to verify the zero valued variable nodes and D1CN is responsible for non-zero valued variable nodes. This usage of this algorithm is when one does not have non- binary matrix. In such cases, employing the third rule violated the locality nature of the algorithms. This issue will be considered in SBB algorithm. = XH algorithm = This algorithm is the same as LM, but it only uses ECN instead of D1CN for the verification of the non-zero variable nodes. If the non-zero elements of the measurement matrix are binary, then this algorithm cannot be implemented efficiently and the locality of the algorithm will be violated. = SBB algorithm = The most powerful practical algorithm among all of the verification message passing algorithms is the SBB algorithm that employs all of the verification rules for the recovery of the original signal. In this algorithm, D1CN and ECN aer responsible for the verification of the non-zero elements of the signal and ZCN and ECN will verify zero variable nodes. The pseudo code of the VB-MPAs is as follows. In the following algorithm \\\\mu_i represents the i^{th} component of the messages emanating from variable and check nodes. VN is in fact a variable that keeps the labels of the verified variable nodes. VN' is also used to keep the set of verified variable nodes in the previous iteration. By using these two variables one can see if there is any progress in the number of verified variable nodes in the algorithm, and if there is no progress then the algorithm will terminate. 1 function VB_MPA(Measurement Matrix A, Compressed Vector y): 2 \\\\mu^c(c) := (y(c),d_c)~~\\\\forall c\\\\in V_r // Initializations 3 \\\\mu^v(v) := (0,0)~~\\\\forall v\\\\in V_l // Initializations 4 VN := \\\\emptyset // Initializations 5 VN' := \\\\\\\\{-1\\\\\\\\} // Initializations 6 While (VN' eq VN) // Main Loop 7 VN' := VN 9 /*= Half round 1 of round 1  */ 10 for every c \\\\in V_r 11 value := y(c) - \\\\sum_{v\\\\in \\\\mathcal{N}(c)}{\\\\mu_2^v(v)\\\\mu_1^v(v)A(c,v)} 12 degree := d_c - \\\\sum_{v\\\\in \\\\mathcal{N}(c)}{\\\\mu_2^v(v)} 13 \\\\mu^c(c) := (value,degree) 14 end for 15 /*= Half round 2 of round 1  */ 16 for every v \\\\in V_r \\\\setminus VN 17 update_rule(v,Algorithm) 18 If a variable node v is verified then 19 add v to VN 20 end if 21 end for 22 /*= Half round 1 of round 2  */ 23 for every c \\\\in V_r 24 value := y(c) - \\\\sum_{v\\\\in \\\\mathcal{N}(c)}{\\\\mu_2^v(v)\\\\mu_1^v(v)A(c,v)} 25 degree := d_c - \\\\sum_{v\\\\in \\\\mathcal{N}(c)}{\\\\mu_2^v(v)} 26 \\\\mu^c(c) := (value,degree) 27 end for 28 /*= Half round 2 of round 2  */ 29 for every v \\\\in V_l \\\\setminus VN 30 if \\\\exists c\\\\in \\\\mathcal{N}(v):~\\\\mu_1^c(c)=0 then 31 \\\\mu^v(v) := (0,1) 32 add v to VN 33 end if 34 end for 35 end while 36 return \\\\mu^v_1(v)~~\\\\forall v\\\\in V_l SBB Algorithm In all of the algorithms the messages emanating from check nodes are the same; however, since the verification rules are different for different algorithms the messages produced by variable nodes will be different in each algorithm. The algorithm given above works for all of the VB-MPA's, and different algorithms use different rules in half round 2 of round 1 and 2. For instance, Genie algorithm uses D1CN rule in Half round 2 of round 1, and in fact the half round 2 of round 2 which uses ZCN rule is useless in Genie algorithm. LM algorithm uses D1CN in Half round 2 of round 1 and XH algorithm uses ECN rule in this stage instead of D1CN. SBB algorithm also uses both D1CN and ECN rule in the second half round of round 1. All of these rules can be efficiently implemented in update_rule function in the second half round of round 1.  Proof of correctness  Although there is no guarantee that these algorithms succeed in all of the cases but we can guarantee that if some of the variable nodes become verified during these algorithms then the values of those variable nodes are correct almost surely. In order to show that it is enough to show that all of the verification rules work perfectly and without false verification. = Correctness of ZCN = The algebraic point of view of ZCN rule is that if in a system of linear equations the right hand side of the equation is zero then almost surely all of the unknowns in that equations are zero. This is due to the fact that the original signal is assumed to be sparse, besides, we also should have the assumption that the non-zero elements of the signals are chosen form a continuous distribution. Suppose that there are d variables in that equation, if some of them in d-1 elements are non-zero then the other d^{th} variable node value should have exactly the negative value of the summation of those d-1 variable nodes. If the non-zero elements of the original signal are chosen from a continuous distribution then the probability of this to occur is zero. Therefore, ZCN rule works perfectly. = Correctness of D1CN = D1CN says that if a variable node is the only unknown variable in an equation then the value of that variable equals the right hand side of that equation. In fact, an equation with just one unknown variable is a check node with degree one, i.e. a check node with just one unverified variable node in its neighborhood. = Correctness of ECN= This rule has two parts, the first part deals with non-zero elements of the signal while the second one is responsible for the zero elements of the original signal. For the first part, it says that if we have two or more equations with the same right hand side, and if we only have one single unknown variable v common in all of those equations then the value of this common variable should be the value of the right hand side of those equations. Besides, it says that all other variables in those equations should be zero. Suppose that one of those variables v' is not zero, then the right hand side of the equation which contains both v, v' should be x(v') + x(v) (For simplicity assume that the edge weights are all 1 or zero). Besides, since we know that v is the only unique variable in all of these equations then there should be one equation c in which v exists and v' does not exist. On the other hand, we know that the right hand side of these equations are the same; therefore, the right hand side of equation c should also be x(v) + x(v'). If we remove v' from this equation we should have the summation of some unknown variables to be a non- zero value x(v'). Since the non-zero elements of x are chosen randomly from a continuous distribution the probability that this summation equals exactly x(v') is zero. Therefore, almost surely the value of v is zero and all other variables in these equations have value zero. There is just one scenario remained for the second part of the ECN rule as most of it has been covered in the first part. This scenario is the one that we have some equations with the same right hand side but there is two or more variable node common in all of those equations. In this case, we can say nothing about those common variable nodes; however, we can say that all the other variable nodes in those equations are zero. The proof of this claim can be achieved by a change of variable in those equations. Suppose that v_1,v_2,...,v_q are the common variable nodes in those equations. If we set v' = v_1+v_2+...+v_q then the problem will be changed to the first part where we only have one common variable node in all of those equations. Therefore, with the same reasoning as in the first part we can see that all other variable nodes that are not common in all of those equations can be verified with value zero almost surely. When the non-zero elements of the measurement matrix are chosen randomly from a continuous distribution, then it can be shown that if one variable node receives equal messages divided by the edge weights from its neighbors then this variable node is the only unique variable connected to all of those check nodes, therefore, the rule can be applied using a local decision approach, and the variable node can verify itself without further knowledge about the other connections of those check nodes. Moreover, the second part of the ECN rule is not necessary to be implemented as the non-zero verified variable node in the ECN rule will be removed from the bipartite graph in the next iteration and ZCN rule will be enough to verify all the zero valued variable nodes remained from those equations with the same right hand side. All in all, when the non- zero elements of the measurement matrix are chosen form a continuous distribution then the SBB and XH algorithm that use ECN rule can be implemented efficiently.  Run-time analysis  Every minor loop in the main loop of the algorithm can be executed in parallel processors, if we consider each variable and check node as a separate processor. Therefore, every minor loop in the algorithm can be executed in constant time O(1). Moreover, since the algorithm will terminate when there is no progress in verification of the variable nodes then the if in the worst case in each iteration of the main loop there is only one variable node to be verified, then the maximum number of times that the main loop will be executed is V_l. Therefore, the whole algorithm will be executed in ) time.

It contains 32 sacred songs, including 24 by Luther, in settings by Walter for three to five parts with the melody in the tenor. Luther wrote a preface for the part books. The collection has been called the root of all Protestant song music.  History  Martin Luther used hymns in German to affirm his ideas of reformation and to have the congregation actively take part in church services. ' was the third German hymnal, after the \\"\\", published in N√ºrnberg by Jobst Gutnecht, and the \\"Erfurt Enchiridion\\", published in Erfurt, both also dating from 1524. ' was published in Wittenberg and is often referred to as the first Wittenberg hymnal. It came with a foreword by Martin Luther: The collection was the first German collection of hymns for choir and was published in Wittenberg in 1524 by Johann Walter, who collaborated with Luther. The hymnal comprised originally 32 songs, 24 of which were written by Luther, including \\"\\" and \\"\\". The settings are for three, four, and five parts (SATTB), with the melody in the tenor. Nine of the songs are psalms paraphrased in metric stanzas, such as \\"\\", a paraphrase of Psalm 130. The order of the songs does not seem to follow a plan, but groupings are apparent, such as Latin songs being placed at the end, preceded by five songs about the topics of the creed and the Trinity: # (Luther) # (Luther) # (Speratus) # (Speratus) # (Speratus) Four of the songs had been part of the ', the first Lutheran hymnal. Luther continued to revise and enlarge the 1524 \\"Wittenberg hymnal\\", adding more songs, and it was reprinted in 1529, 1531, 1533, 1535, and 1543. This culminated in an edition titled Geystliche Lieder, prefaced by Luther and published by Valentin Babst in Leipzig in 1545 shortly before Luther's death. Contemporaneous editions of hymnals for lay people followed the organization of Luther's choral \\"Wittenberg hymnal\\" rather closely. For example, the Wittenberg Enchiridion of 1526 (full title Enchyridion of Spiritual Songs and Psalms for the Laity, Improved with Many More than Previously). contained ten more songs, with seven of them placed at the end and two others following a song with the same melody.

During his corps' passage across Habsburg territory, Rosenberg kept strict discipline among his soldiers while ensuring that his hosts kept up their end of the bargain with regard to providing his men with food and living quarters. Rosenberg was remembered as being highly professional and concerned with the welfare of his men, but aloof in his dealings with the rank and file.

It was first published by DAW Books in 1976. The Dray Prescot series is made of several cycles of novels, each cycle essentially forming a series within the series. In addition to being the thirteenth volume in the series as a whole, Renegade of Kregen is also the second of three volumes in the Krozair Cycle. It is set in the fictional Eye of the World on the continent of Turismond . The 52 completed novels of the Dray Prescot series were written by Bulmer between 1972 and 1997, when a stroke stopped his writing, also the later Dray Prescot books, after 1988, were originally only published in German. The series is in the spirit of Edgar Rice Burroughs John Carter of Mars series.Ken Bulmer obituary The Guardian, published: 22 December 2005, accessed: 7 December 2014 Plot summary Map of the Eye of the World The book continues on shortly after the events from The Tides of Kregen with Prescot and Duhrra arriving in Magdag to look for a ship to take them to Vallia and the two take passage on an argenter from Menaham. Attacked by pirates and rescued by a galley from Magdag, Prescot and the captain are taken before the ship's master, Gafard, a renegade from the south. He persuades Prescot, still traveling under the name of Dak, to join him. Prescot joins Gafard, who is an admirer of Pur Dray but unawares that the former has been declared an Apushniad and that he is in his presence. Prescot is accepted in the ranks of the Grodnim as a renegade by King Genod, receiving the new name of Gadak. The latter also encounters Princess Susheeng in the process who does not recognise him. During the ceremony Prescot is visited by Zena Iztar again who questions his motives and once more tells him that, to be allowed to leave the Eye of the World he must become a Krozair of Zy again. Prescot and Duhrra than ride north with Gafard and an army to fight a barbarian invasion. On the way Prescot saves Gafard's life and the life of his Lady when attacked by a predator. By saving the girl, revered to as the Lady of the Stars by Gafard, he sees her face, normally hidden, and for the first time in his life feels he has met a women equal to Delia in beauty. Gafard keeps her a secret to protect her from King Genod's in saturable desire for women and Prescot is instructed never to mention the girls beauty. After a successful campaign Gafard is called back urgently to Magdag with Prescot accompanying him. Prescot is now once more resolved to regain his status as Krozair. In Magdag they learn that Shazmoz has been relieved and that the Zairians are on the advance while the tidal wave created by Prescot has swept away the Grodnim supplies. Gafard, ordered south with a new army, makes Prescot the standard bearer for the Lady of the Stars who is to accompany them on their trip. The Grodnim army lands behind the Zairian lines, east of Shazmoz and, when King Genod arrives with two air boats Prescot forms the plan to capture those and Genod as well as Gafard. He succeeds in taking the larger air boat but then unexpectedly encounters his old Hamalian friends Rees and Chido and realises that the two would recognise him, forcing him to hide. With the opportunity gone the army marches into battle the next day and Prescot decides to make a stand then and there but is prevented when news comes that the Lady of the Stars has been abducted. Prescot, along with a handful of men loyal to Gafard head out to rescue her and succeed just in time. After the successful rescue and battle Gafard and his followers, with Prescot, return to Magdag. Attempts to abduct Gafard's Lady continue unsuccessful for the time.

Early life Minami was born as Iwama Tetsuro, the younger son of a wealthy farming family in Himi, Toyama, who had served for three generations in the Toyama prefectural assembly. He graduated from Tokyo Imperial University with a legal degree and passed his civil service examinations in 1896. Afterwards, he married the eldest daughter of Minami Heikichi, the chairman of the Toyama Prefectural Assembly, and changed his name to Minami Hiroshi. After serving in several posts within the Prime Minister‚Äôs office and the Home Ministry, Minami was appointed Chief Cabinet Secretary under the 1st Saionji administration in 1908, and served in that post again from 1911 to 1912.

It provides assistance to artists and galleries, and manages the Fonds national d'art contemporain (FNAC; National Foundation for Contemporary Art). Background The Cnap has its origins in the Division des Beaux-Arts (Fine Arts Division) created in 1791 just after the French Revolution with its own budget to encourage living artists and educate citizens. This was succeeded in turn by the Bureau des Beaux-Arts in 1800, Bureau de l'encouragement des Arts in 1879, the Bureau des Travaux d'art in 1882 and finally the Centre national des arts plastiques (Cnap) in 1982. Throughout this history the goal was to encourage creation of contemporary work. CNAP was created by a prime ministerial decree of 15 October 1982, under the Minister of Culture. Activities The purpose of Cnap was defined as support and promotion of artistic creation in different forms including photography, graphic arts, design and crafts. The Cnap acquires and commissions works of art, and disseminates them, contributes to modern application of ancient crafts, and to application of new technologies and materials, supports visual artists and provides education to the public and to artists. Cnap provides various types of assistance to artists resident in France. Research grants are given to artists to fund research or development of an artistic project. Assistance may be given for creation of an audiovisual or multimedia work. Galleries may be funded for the first solo exhibition of an artist, or for production of the first catalog of an artist's work in a gallery. A writer, theoretician or art critic may be given support for research. Collection Work from CNAP in the center of the rotunda of the Mus√©e Guimet in 2012. Participatory work on the floor by (1999), swatches on the wall by Michael Woolworth (2003). Cnap was given responsibility for managing the Fonds national d'art contemporain (FNAC; National Foundation for Contemporary Art). As of 2014 the foundation, dating back to the French Revolution, had 95,000 works. Many of these are displayed in museums, public places and government buildings. The Centre Georges Pompidou opened in 1977, now housing the Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne (National Museum of Modern Art), and many modern works were transferred to it from the FNAC, which now focuses on contemporary art. The foundation has three main collections: the historical collection, the modern collection and the contemporary collection. The historical collection includes over 21,000 works from the late 18th to early 20th centuries, predominantly by French artists. There are 13,000 paintings, 5,500 sculptures and 2,000 graphics arts objects. Almost half of these works were commissioned, and many are official portraits of various heads of state and sovereigns. Many of the works have been deposited with regional museums, churches and public buildings such as city halls, hospitals and schools. The modern collection covers the period from the early 20th century to the start of the 1960s, and includes almost 34,000 works by more than 9,000 artists. The number of commissioned works, or works bought from the Salon is much lower than in the 19th century. There are representative works from the different movements of the 1920s and 1930s, and also works from the renewal of religious art with the Chantiers du cardinal. The modern collection also shows greater openness to foreign artists working in Paris, including Latin American, Arab- Muslim and Asian artists. The contemporary collection covers the period from the 1960s to the present, with more than 48,700 works as of 2014. 40,000 of these have been added to the collection since 1980. It is divided into Visual Arts, Photography, Audiovisual ‚Äì Video ‚Äì New Media, Decorative Arts and Design. The collection has grown through acquisitions, donations and commissions, and attempts to be fully representative regardless of gender, age or region of origin, covering the diverse contemporary artistic trends and creative practices.

It was announced at the International Defence Exhibition and Seminar in 2014. Little detail is known about it, other than claims for its performance. The Takbir is a winged glide bomb, with internal guidance. It is unknown if it is a conversion of an existing dumb bomb, a field add-on kit for existing bombs, or a new and integrated weapon. It resembles a typical dumb with an added dorsal housing and a pair of fold-out wings. There is also an extended nose. The guidance system is unknown but has been described as both GPS-based, inertial guidance and possibly having some form of optical terminal guidance. Pakistan has previously used the Chinese LS-6 glide bomb with their JF-17 Thunder aircraft. The Takbir appears to be an indigenously produced development of the LS-6, although the nose extension is a new feature. A weapon test in March 2019 involving the JF-17 may have been the first public test of the Takbir, although details in the released video were blacked out. The bomb has a range of about 80 to 100 km, and it can carry 200 to 250 kg of explosive material. The bomb can be guided through a satellite or launched from an aircraft. A fighter pilot launching the bomb can add or modify information about the target. As it is fired from an aircraft, its folded wings unfold and it glides towards its target. It can dodge obstacles obstructing its path toward its destination. Its flight system is based on gliding, by using the bomb's inertia. By using this bomb a pilot can hit their target without entering an enemy's territory.

Jeffery Company from 1913 in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and after 1916 by Nash Motors, which acquired the Jeffery Company. Production of the Quad continued unchanged through 1928. The Quad introduced numerous engineering innovations. Its design and durability proved effective in traversing the muddy, rough, and unpaved roads of the times. The Quad also became one of the most successful vehicles in World War I. The Quad was produced in large numbers by Jeffery and Nash, as well as under license by other truck makers. Development The United States Army needed to replace the four-mule teams used to haul standard one-and-a- half-ton loads with a truck and requested proposals in late 1912. The company began development by purchasing a new Four Wheel Drive Auto Company (FWD), but found it to be unacceptable and sold the vehicle to begin its own design from scratch. By July 1913, the capacity truck was ready for public demonstration of its capabilities. The Jeffery designed a four-wheel-drive truck, known as the \\"Quad\\" or \\"Jeffery Quad\\" subsequently greatly assisted the subsequent efforts during World War I by several Allied nations, particularly the French. The Jeffery Quad became the workhorse of the Allied Expeditionary Force. These unique vehicles also saw heavy service under General John J. \\"Blackjack\\" Pershing as both the Jeffery armored car and as regular transports during the Army's 1916 Punitive Expedition through Mexico; Quads were also used extensively during Pershing's later European campaigns of World War I. The United States Marine Corps also adopted the Jeffery Quad, using it in the Haiti and Dominican Republic conflicts from 1915 through 1917. Approximately 11,500 Jeffery and Nash Quads were built between 1913 and 1919. \\"Four-wheel drive trucks had been built before ... but aside from the Jeffery Quad (Nash Quad, per subsequent purchase) earlier designs were inefficient, crude, and flimsy.\\" Design Initially called the Rambler Quadruple for its car-derived Rambler four-cylinder that produced . Development called for a switch to a Buda manufactured side-valve four-cylinder engine that was rated at , but actually producing at 1,800 rpm. The Quad had four-wheel drive and four-wheel brakes, as well as an innovative four-wheel steering system. This novel approach to steering allowed the rear wheels to track the front wheels around turns, such that the rear wheels did not have to dig new \\"ruts\\" on muddy curves because most roads of the day were unpaved and often badly rutted. This four-wheel steering mechanism was integrated with Muehl limited-slip differentials on both the front and rear axles. From the transfer case, shafts led to the top of both the front and rear solid portal axles giving the trucks a very high ground clearance allowing it to drive through mud up to its hubcaps. Engine power was transmitted by half-shafts with a u-joint and bearing that was connected by a pinion gear to each of the four wheels from the dual differentials that positioned parallel to but above the load-bearing \\"dead\\" axles. This pinion gear then drove an internal toothed ring gear at each of the four wheels. The Quad's combination of innovative features constituted a revolutionary approach to four-wheel drive and allowed the truck to traverse soft and poor conditions with unprecedented effectiveness. Legacy The Quad was one of the first successful four-wheel drive vehicles ever to be made, and its production continued for 15 years with a total of 41,674 units made. Concurrently with the Quad's production, the company expanded its truck line by building conventional 1.5 ton trucks with double chain rear-wheel drive. The Quads ability to traverse terrain across the globe that challenged modern trucks meant civilians used their slow, but unstoppable work at least until the 1950s. In 1954, Nash Motors merged with Hudson Motor Car Company to form American Motors Corporation (AMC), which acquired the vehicle operations of Kaiser Jeep in 1974 to complement its passenger car lines. The combined automaker's ancestry reached back to the famed World War I \\"Quad\\".

Description and history The Mechanic Institute is a large four-story brick structure located at the southeast corner of Congress and Exchange Streets in central Rumford, Maine. The main facade faces Congress Street, and has four plate glass storefronts with recessed entrances, and a centered entry to the upper levels. The entrance is shaped to resemble stone blocks, with a similar segmented arch above. The main feature of this facade is a recessed colonnade of six Doric columns rising two stories to an entablature and cornice, which above the central storefronts. The end bays have an array of tall windows, separated by pilasters and topped by an entablature on the second level, and four bays of sash windows (now mostly bricked in) at the third level, all of which is framed by two-story brick pilasters and topped by a lintel-like painted projecting with keystone outlines. The fourth level of the outer bays has four sash window spaces, now filled in, while the space above the colonnade in the central bays has a recessed cornice line with brackets. The building was built in 1910 by the Rumford Power Falls Company, whose notably paternalistic attitude toward its workers included construction of high-quality housing at Strathglass Park. The purpose of the building was to provide a social and educational venue for its mill workers, with stores at the ground level, and educational and meeting spaces above.

Jeff Swindoll from Monsters and Critics wrote, \\"The Hard Easy isn't Pulp Fiction but it was a nice little crime-thriller that benefits from the performances with kudos going toward the older members of the cast, but the young bucks aren't too bad either. The tale is full of some interesting twists and comes off well in the end.\\" Rachel Buccicone of 7M Pictures wrote, \\"The Hard Easy is actually a very good story and reminds me in some ways of films like Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. There is not one dull moment from start to the very twist- filled end.

The document, signed at the Royal Palace of Caserta, was to become effective on May 2, 1945. Although British Field Marshal Harold Alexander claimed the Surrender of Caserta shortened the war in Europe by six to eight weeks and saved Northern Italy from more destruction along with tens of thousands of lives, the German Commander-in-Chief of Army Group C Heinrich von Vietinghoff had noted on 28 April that fighting would cease within one or two days regardless of negotiations, the German troops having neither arms nor ammunition left. Further destruction was thus unlikely, Army Group C having decided already on 11 April to not carry out Hitler's scorched earth policy. Owing in part to Allied air attacks, the German forces in Italy had received no supplies from Germany since the first week of April. Since Allied aircraft had destroyed all bridges across the Po river, the Germans abandoned their heavy weapons and motor vehicles south of it during the Allied spring offensive. What was left of the German infantry was mostly wiped out during the fighting. The remaining troops had retreated across the Po using improvised transports and were reorganized by blocking detachments to man the front line and fight on, but without arms their situation was hopeless.

Before forming Fullbright, three of the staff worked together on Minerva's Den, the single-player expansion to BioShock 2. During the development of Gone Home, the team worked and lived together in the same house. After its release, one team member left to found a new studio, Dim Bulb Games. Fullbright's next game, Tacoma, was released in August 2017.  History  = Minerva's Den and founding = Steve Gaynor, one of the founders of Fullbright The Fullbright Company was formed by Steve Gaynor, Johnnemann Nordhagen, and Karla Zimonja in March 2012. Kate Craig, an environment artist, joined the company full-time in August 2012. They had previously worked together at other video game developers but \\"were attracted to the artistic liberty and self-management of a small game studio\\", with the freedoms of working without rigid schedules and relationships. They live and work together in a northeast Portland, Oregon, house known as the Fullbright House, except for Craig, who worked remotely from Vancouver, Washington. Craig likened the group to \\"being in a band\\" due to their closeness partially necessitated by lack of money, such as in sharing flights and lodging. Steve Gaynor attended Portland State and dabbled in several arts fields before using level design to enter the games industry. He made levels for first-person shooter video game F.E.A.R. on his own, and entered Sony in San Francisco as a games tester in 2006. His experience with F.E.A.R. levels brought him to Houston's TimeGate Studios, at work on the low-pressure F.E.A.R. expansion Perseus Mandate. He joined 2K Marin in 2008 after receiving encouragement from the BioShock 2 creative director to apply. Gaynor was the lead designer on the game's single- player expansion Minerva's Den in 2010. The Minerva team was small, and included Zimonja and Nordhagen. Zimonja was their 2D artist and collaborated on the game's story with Gaynor, though she saw herself more as an editor than a writer. Gaynor left 2K for Irrational Games in 2011 to work on BioShock Infinite. Though the two wanted to collaborate, they were now split between Boston and San Francisco, where Zimonja continued at 2K on The Bureau: XCOM Declassified. Unsatisfied with big budget work, Gaynor and his wife moved to Portland, where they both wanted to live, and Gaynor sought to make a \\"personal game, one with an intimate narrative\\" without soliciting outside money or growing larger than a small team. As Gaynor and Zimonja lacked computer programming expertise, they reached out to Nordhagen, who had recently sent an \\"existentially introspective\\" tweet about his career. Together, they formed The Fullbright Company. = Gone Home = The Fullbright Company at the Game Developers Choice Awards in 2014. From left, Kate Craig, Steve Gaynor, Johnnemann Nordhagen and Karla Zimonja Gone Home is a video game that features a female protagonist. It included support for controllers, which Polygon credited to the team's experience on AAA first-person shooters. In its first weeks following release, Gone Home was a top seller on Steam and covered in The New York Times. It won \\"Best Debut\\" at the 2014 BAFTA Game Awards and 2014 Game Developers Choice Awards, and Polygon 2013 game of the year. Its release begat discussions about narrative and gameplay in video games, for the game's focus on empathic story and lack of gun-based gameplay. The Fullbright Company partnered with indie publisher Midnight City to produce a video game console port of Gone Home. Fullbright originally built the game for personal computers so as to not worry about the design limitations and optimizations necessary for a console release. Wanting to move on to their next game, the company sought out a publisher to do the porting work for them. Following release, Nordhagen left to found his own studio, Dim Bulb Games, in June 2014. The Fullbright Company rebranded itself as Fullbright two months later, on August 4, 2014, and wrote that its continued focus would be on \\"immersive, unforgettable story exploration video games\\". Chris Plante of Polygon cited Fullbright as an example of \\"smaller, independently owned studios\\" whose games show signs of social progress in the video game medium. = Tacoma = Fullbright announced their next game, Tacoma, at The Game Awards in December 2014. The brief trailer featured a radio dialogue between a man and a woman, set in the Lunar Transfer Station Tacoma 200,000 miles from Earth. Polygon noted that its aesthetic was similar to Rapture, the underwater city of BioShock. Tacoma was released on August 2, 2017 on PC and Xbox One.

Santino planned attacks by taking stones from the protective moat and placing them only on the side facing the visitors on the island where he lives. Later, when the visitors arrived, he would throw the stones across the moat at them.

After Min's fall, he served under Liu Congxiao, who controlled Qingyuan Circuit (headquartered in modern Quanzhou, Fujian), in nominal submission to Southern Tang. After Liu's death, the officer Chen Hongjin overthrew Liu's nephew and successor Liu Shaozi and supported Zhang, but later overthrew Zhang as well and took over himself.  During Min  It is not known when Zhang Hansi was born or what his geographic origins were, as there were no biographies of his in traditional histories‚Äîalthough he was described as being old aged at the time of his eventual death. In any case, as of 944, he was serving as an army officer at Min's Quan Prefecture (Ê≥âÂ∑û, in modern Quanzhou, Fujian). At that time, the Min state was in turmoil, as the general Zhu Wenjin had just assassinated the emperor Wang Yanxi (Emperor Jingzong) and seized the throne, and was battling with Wang Yanxi's younger brother Wang Yanzheng (who had earlier declared himself the emperor of a new branch state of Yin) for the control of the realm.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 284. Zhu, after his coup, sent the general Huang Shaopo (ÈªÉÁ¥πÈ†ó) to serve as the prefect of Quan. Zhang's colleague Liu Congxiao encouraged other officers, including Wang Zhongshun (ÁéãÂø†È†Ü), Zhang, and Dong Si'an (Ëë£ÊÄùÂÆâ) to join him in a plot against Huang, arguing that they, having been the long-term subjects of Min's ruling Wang family, could not stand by and allow Zhu to take over. They agreed, and they assassinated Huang and supported Wang Yanzheng's nephew Wang Jixun (ÁéãÁπºÂã≥) to serve as the acting prefect, pledging their allegiance to Wang Yanzheng. Wang Yanzheng subsequently commissioned Wang Jixun as prefect and gave commander titles to Liu, Wang Zhongshun, Dong, and Chen Hongjin‚Äîwith no reference to Zhang at that point.  After Min's fall  Wang Yanzheng's realm, however, was subsequently conquered by Min's northern neighbor Southern Tang. Liu Congxiao seized control of the Quan region, which became known as Qingyuan Circuit, in nominal submission to Southern Tang‚Äîand, after Southern Tang eventually had to itself formally submit to Later Zhou and then Later Zhou's successor state Song as a vassal‚Äîto both Southern Tang and Song.History of Song, vol. 483. Liu Congxiao apparently died in 962. Under the account given in the Xu Zizhi Tongjian (also adopted in the Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms), after Liu Congxiao's death, as Liu Shaoji was then on a tributary mission sent by Liu Congxiao to the Southern Tang court, Liu Shaozi took over as acting military governor. However, not long after, Chen Hongjin seized him and falsely accused him of planning to submit to Wuyue, and then delivered him to Southern Tang and supported Zhang Hansi, who was then the deputy military governor, as the new acting military governor.Xu Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 2. Under the account in Liu's biography in the History of Song, the coup happened before Liu Congxiao's death, and therefore (implicitly) Liu Shaozi never controlled the circuit‚Äîbut under Chen's biography, it gave the same account as the Xu Zizhi Tongjian (i.e., the coup was during Liu Shaozi's rule). It was said, though, that Zhang, on account of his old age, was incapable of governing the circuit, and most of the matters ended up being decided by Chen, whom he made the deputy military governor. Zhang was apprehensive about Chen's hold over the governance, and held a feast, intending to set a trap for Chen at the feast and kill him. Before the ambush could occur, however, an earthquake happened, shocking Zhang's adherents, who then informed Chen. Chen immediately left the feast before he could be ambushed. Zhang, now fearing that Chen would act first, had his own headquarters put under heavy guard. In summer 963, Chen took his soldiers and headed for Zhang's headquarters. When arriving at the headquarters, rather than attacking it, he simply ordered Zhang's guards to disperse, and the guards, apparently intimidated, did so. He then entered the headquarters and, finding Zhang in the inner chambers, locked the inner chambers, stating to him, \\"The soldiers and the civilian administrators all thought you, Lord, to be senile and crazy. They asked me, Chen Hongjin, to take over on an acting basis. You cannot resist the will of the people. Please yield your seal.\\" Zhang, surprised and not able to think what else to do, turned his seal to Chen, who then announced the transition to the officers and administrators and took over control of the circuit. Chen moved Zhang to a retreat home and put him under house arrest there, under heavy guard. Zhang died of natural causes several years later.Xu Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 3.

Under his influence, Serbia became the first country in the world to openly endorse the Balfour Declaration of 1917, which called for a Jewish homeland in Palestine. A lieutenant-colonel in the Royal Serbian Army, he was one of his country's representatives at the Versailles peace negotiations, president of the Jewish Community of Belgrade, vice-president of the Council of Jewish Communities of Yugoslavia, and president of Yugoslavia's Jewish National Fund. He was sent to the United States on a Serbian Royal Mission from 1917 to 1919. Between 1939 and 1942, he was a special delegate to the Yugoslav legation in Washington D.C., where he died. Early years and Vienna Albala was born David Kovu in Belgrade in 1886. He was one of seven children. After the death of his parents, the children were adopted and received new surnames. Albala's father was a merchant. In high school, Albala, an observant Sephardi Jew, served as president of the local student Zionist society. In 1905, Albala left to study medicine at the University of Vienna. There, he also learned English and German, and continued his participation in Zionist activities. During a summer vacation from his studies, Albala returned to his hometown and founded a Jewish student association called Gideon, something tried previously by David Alkalai, a lawyer, founder and leader of the Zionist movement in Serbia and Yugoslavia. Albala also became president of the Balkan Jewish Zionist organization, Bar-Giora, associating with Croatian Zionist leader Aleksandar Licht and others. Physician and military officer After becoming a doctor in 1910, he returned to Serbia, visiting the synagogue less often. Asked by his father about this change, Albala asserted, \\"But I am a devoted Zionist.\\" The father's reply, \\"Ah, my son, one must be a Jew as well as a Zionist,\\" influenced Albala's behavior thereafter. He became president of the Executive Board of the Jewish Religious Communities. Albala fought in the First Balkan War, Second Balkan War, and World War I, rising to the rank of Captain in the Serbian Royal Army as a ship's doctor. Recovering from exhaustion on the island of Corfu, he discussed with Nikola Pa≈°iƒá his idea to acquaint the US with the needs of Serbia. Serbian Royal Mission to the United States Albala was subsequently sent by his government on a Serbian Royal Mission to the United States, arriving in New York City on September 26, 1917; he established support with Jewish communities and met with Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Louis Brandeis, who became his most influential friend. Through this relationship, he associated with Chaim Weizmann, Stephen Samuel Wise, Cyrus Adler and others. The Balfour Declaration was issued on November 2, 1917. Using his close relations with Serbian leadership, it was at Albala's suggestion that the Serbian government endorsed the Declaration on December 27, the first country to do so. The Serbian statement, written as a letter by Milenko Radomar Vesniƒá to Albala, was \\"the first time any government had referred to the yet-to-be-created Jewish state as 'Israel'\\". In the 1919 publication by the Zionist Organization of America, The American War Congress and Zionism: Statements by Members of the American War Congress on the Jewish National Movement, more than 100 US senators and congressmen gave statements, as did various international governments; Vesniƒá's letter to Albala is the third statement in the publication. Return to Serbia After a year and a half, Albala returned to Serbia. In 1919, he was sent to the Paris Peace Conference as an aide and counselor to the Serbian delegation. With Weizmann and Menachem Ussishkin, Albala discussed the creation of Palestine. Returning to Belgrade, he did not return full-time to the medical profession, but did have a medical practice in Vrnjci in the summertime. What he did do was spend the next 20 years as a community leader of Jews in Yugoslavia. He founded several Yugoslav Jewish organizations such as \\"Karmel\\" for young women, the Jewish National Society, and Keren Kayemet (also served as president). He was co-founder of Keren Hayesod. The history of the Library of the Federation of Jewish Communities of Serbia traces back to an initiative of Albala's when he was President of the Sephardic Jewish Community. He organized The Association of Jugoslav Jews in the United States. Albala founded three journals: The Jewish Newsletter (1920‚Äì1922, editor-in-chief), The Review of the Union of Jewish Religious communities (1932, editor-in-chief), and The Newsletter of the Jewish Sephardic Religious Community (1938‚Äì1941). He wrote a few theatrical pieces, including \\"Erev Jom Kipu\\", which was performed several times, printed in \\"Benevolence\\" (Sarajevo, 1924). A great number of his articles about Jewish problems appeared in newspapers such as ≈Ωidov (Zagreb), Jewish Voice (Sarajevo), and Politika (Belgrade). He was also a fundraiser for various Jewish causes, making speeches which would include memorized sections in Hebrew. In the spring of 1935, he was invited to Palestine to dedicate the planting of King Alexander's Forest in El Hartije, near Haifa; he was one of five honorees of the occasion, the others being, Dr. Marko Bauer, Dr. A. Licht, Falio Koenig, and Mrs. Koenig. In the Autumn 1938, he was invited to London for a Round Table conference of the world's Jewry; the conference convened in February 1939. Return to the United States In 1939, Albala became the third president of the Jewish Community of Belgrade. In December 1939, he 'disappeared'. Because of his close ties with the royal family, Albala was secretly sent back to the United States by regent Paul, who sent him to the United States to acquire funding for arms with which to repel the Germans. Albala was not successful because Serbia owed the United States a large sum which had not been repaid. When his wife, Professor Paulina Lebl- Albala and daughter, Jelena, joined him in Washington D.C., the matter became known. Albala died unexpectedly in Washington, D.C. in 1942. For his efforts many trees were planted in his name in Palestine. Albala is the grandfather of Wikipedia editor Rosie Stephenson-Goodknight.

It is composed of military forces and personnel from over 30 countries. The stated aim of CJTF‚ÄìOIR is to \\"degrade and destroy\\" ISIL. Its establishment by US Central Command was announced in December 2014, after it was set up to replace the ad hoc arrangements that had previously been established to coordinate operations following the rapid gains made by ISIL in Iraq in June.

History From August 2014 to August 2015, coalition aircraft flew a total of 45,259 sorties, with the U.S. Air Force flying the majority (67%), and dropped more than 5,600 bombs. At the time, The Guardian reported that a team of independent journalists had published details of 52 airstrikes which killed more than 450 civilians. The coalition acknowledged only 2 non-combatant deaths. On 3 October 2015, Tunisia announced it would join CJTF‚ÄìOIR. On 22 December 2018, three days after Donald Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw all its troops from Syria, Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to the coalition against ISIL, announced his resignation from his post. In April 2019, a joint investigation by Amnesty International and Airwars reported that 1,600 civilians were killed by coalition airstrikes and U.S. artillery shelling during the four-month battle to capture the Syrian city of Raqqa from ISIL in 2017. The Coalition states it conducted 34,464 strikes against ISIL targets between 8 August 2014 and end of March 2019, and unintentionally killed at least 1,291 civilians. In June 2019, United States Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Michael Mulroy said \\"Five years ago, ISIS controlled approximately 55,000 square kilometers and more than 4 million people in Iraq lived under their oppressive rule, Now they do not. The Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve continues to help train and equip 28 Iraqi brigades comprising thousands of soldiers. The more capable Iraq's security institutions, the more resilient Iraq will be in the face of malign foreign actors bent on coercion and exploitation.\\" On 5 January 2020, Lt. Gen. White posted a statement on his official Twitter account, pausing operations with the Iraqis: > Our first priority is protecting all Coalition personnel committed to the > defeat of Daesh.

Structure As of September 2019, U.S. Army Lieutenant General Robert \\"Pat\\" White commands CJTF-OIR in an appointment which consolidates three commander's tasks. White is also the commander of the U.S. III Corps, which assumed authority over CJTF-OIF from ARCENT on 22 September 2015, turned over its command to XXVIII Airborne Corps, and then resumed command.

Early life Born in Zwickau, East Germany, to a German mother and a Nigerian father,Anne Thomas, \\"Berlin marks Black History Month but the struggle goes on\\", Mixed Race Studies, 16 February 2012. Katharina Oguntoye was raised in both Nigeria and Heidelberg, Germany. She grew up with a younger brother and recalls their awareness of race and racism as they got older. She describes growing up among other black people, unlike other Afro-Germans. Growing up with her father and other African relatives allowed her to see her Blackness in a positive way and she missed that when she returned to Germany at the age of nine. That move back was hard and she often describes internalized racism and how she has struggled. In a conversation with the other editors of the Showing Our Colors anthology she states: \\"Because of the time I spent in Africa I'm conscious of the parts of me which are alive there and simply don't exist here in Germany. Because nobody wants to get to know them here, especially not my friends. I think about why that is, and I believe that racist structures prevent us from talking about it. Furthermore, there's a lot of unacknowledged fear underlying this.\\"Opitz, Oguntoye, Schultz (eds), Showing Our Colors, 1992, p. 160.

She grew up in the cultural lifestyle of the Na-Cho Ny√§k Dun, speaking the Northern Tutchone language, an endangered Athabaskan language.

She was the founder and First President of the Pennsylvania Association of Deans of Women, the founder of the Society of Cwens, and the President of the National Association of Deans of Women (NADW). Her main area of interest was in student personnel, especially for women. She was also a member of the American Association of University Women. Amos Hall, an all-female residence hall at Schenley Quadrangle that houses nine sororities, is named after her. It was dedicated to Amos on June 9, 1961. Biography Her father was Joseph B Amos, who lived in Indiana. She earned her bachelor's degree in Psychology in 1917 and a Master of Arts degree in Educational Psychology with a concentration in Mental Testing, and Educational Measurements in 1919, both at the University of Kansas. Her Master's thesis was titled \\"High School Normal Training as Preparation for Rural Teaching\\". She visited Howard University during the 1924-5 school year to attend meetings and give talks to the female students. She is buried at the Fairview Shawnee Cemetery in Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma. University of Pittsburgh =Dean of Women= The Braun Room in the Cathedral of Learning. The Office of Dean of Women was created at a select number of established universities in the early 1900s to ensure that, outside the classroom, experiences of female students complimented their overall academic success. Amos was Dean of Women from 1919 to 1941. The original office for the Dean of Women and other women's organizations was in Heinz House, a one-story wooden building north of Alumni Hall (now known as Eberly Hall) that was built in 1919. In 1924, Heinz House was closed, and all offices were moved to the Cathedral of Learning. Braun Room Her office moved to the twelfth floor of the Cathedral of Learning. The office space on the twelfth floor was still unfinished when Dan Amos died in 1941. The Alumnae Association created the Thyrsa W. Amos Fund to plaster the walls and to furnish Room 1217 in her name. Room 1217 was never finished, but after World War II the other rooms on the twelfth floor were completed including the Braun room which served as a meeting space for women students. Mrs. A. E. Braun donated the furnishings and floral carved mahogany wood paneling which she had purchased in 1941 from the library of the home of Grant McCargo in the East End of Pittsburgh. The Braun Room was dedicated in 1946 and serves, along with its furniture, as an example of a modern reproduction of Louis XV design. Original blue carpeting was replaced in 1955 with an oriental rug, named \\"The Iron Rug of Persia\\", that was donated by the daughter and son-in-law of A. E. Braun. Other features of the room include a low bookcase, bordered and topped with classic carving, that was crafted by university carpenters to replace the original fireplace whose inclusion was impractical on the 12th floor, along with two crystal drop chandeliers. Dean Helen Pool Rush and her successor, Dean Savina Skewis, carried on the traditions of Dean Amos until the Dean of Women's Office was closed in 1969, and its functions and quarters were assumed by other departments. =Society of Cwens= Amos Hall, a women's residence hall at the University of Pittsburgh Amos was an important influence in making mentoring, instead of hazing, the focus of women's organizations on campus. In the early 1920s, Dean Thyrsa Amos saw the need for a society for outstanding sophomore women, as the University of Pittsburgh had recently started the Society of Druids for sophomore men. On 7 November 1922, twelve sophomore women responded to invitations and met at Heinz House, electing to found a society to sponsor activities for all freshmen and sophomore women and to \\"select for membership in the spring those freshman women who displayed the finest Pitt spirit, showed good scholarship and expressed interest in activities through fine participation in them\\". The society was named Cwens, from the word cwƒìn, meaning \\"lady\\" or \\"queen\\" in Anglo-Saxon. The emblem selected was a golden crown resting upon a sceptre. In 1975, the Title IX Education Amendments mandated the abolishment of single-sex organizations in institutions of higher learning. In October 1975, Cwens chapter presidents gave authority to the National Executive Board to disband the society and to formulate plans for a national sophomore honor society for both men and women. The National Board disbanded the National Society of Cwens, founding the Lambda Sigma Society as a direct descendant on 6 March 1976.

Adjil Kribi, ¬´ Les trois pr√©sidents ont sign√© la Constitution ¬ª, Al Huffington Post, January 27 2014. This Constitution is the result of a compromise between the Islamist party Ennahdha (head of government) and the opposition forces. It provides for shared executive powers, gives preference to Islam and, for the first time in legal history of the Arab world, introduced a target parity between men and women in elected bodies. Articles This description of the Tunisian Constitution of 2014 draws on its unofficial English translation. =Preamble= The preamble to the Constitution recalls the struggle of Tunisians for independence in 1956 as the fight for democracy led during the Jasmine Revolution of 14 January 2011. The preamble affirms the people's attachment to human rights and to its Arab-Muslim identity. It describes Tunisia as a republican and democratic civil state based on law, where sovereignty belongs to the people and the principle of separation of powers is guaranteed. The preamble also states that Tunisia must participate in the unification of the Arab world and support liberation movements, including the Palestinian movement. Finally, the preamble states that the Tunisian people must contribute to sustainable development, to world peace and solidarity among the members of humanity. =General principles= The third article of the Tunisian Constitution provides that the people is the bearer of sovereignty. Article 4 defines the official flag and national anthem of the state. The ancient motto - \\"Liberty, Justice and Order\\" \\\\- is replaced by : \\"Liberty, Dignity, Justice and Order\\". Tunisia contributes to the unification of the Arab Maghreb. Article 6 provides that the state is the guardian of religion; it also guarantees freedom of conscience and political neutrality of mosques and other places of worship. Apostasy campaigns and incitements to hatred and violence are prohibited. Participation in national service and paying taxes are duties for all citizens. International treaties approved by the Assembly of the Representatives of the People override all other laws but are subjects to the Constitution. =Rights and freedoms= In the Constitution of 1959, the rights and freedoms were only presented in summary form; the detail was set out in individual laws. Article 31 says, \\"Freedom of opinion, thought, expression, information and publication shall be guaranteed. These freedoms shall not be subject to prior censorship.\\" Under Article 39, education is mandatory until the age of 16. In this regard, the State has the duty \\"to embed youth in the Arab-Islamic identity and their national belonging; strengthen and promote the Arabic language and expand its usage; instill openness to foreign languages and human civilisations; and spread the culture of human rights\\". Article 49 provides that the law defines the terms surrounding the rights and freedoms enumerated in the Constitution and it supervises them in a spirit of proportionality, to ensure the rights and freedoms of others and to protect the public interest. The same article states that \\"No amendment that undermines any human rights acquisitions or freedoms guaranteed in this Constitution is allowed\\". =Legislative power= Under Article 50 of the Constitution, the legislative power is exercised by the people through the elected members of the Assembly of the Representatives of the People and referendum. Assembly of the Representatives of the People The Tunisian Parliament is unicameral and is elected for a term of 5 years. Article 60 guarantees the rights of the parliamentary opposition in the Assembly of the Representatives of the People. Any Tunisian citizen who is at least 18 years of age has the right to vote; Tunisians resident abroad must also enjoy this right and have their own representation in Parliament. Anyone who has held Tunisian nationality for at least 10 years and is at least 23 years old may be a candidate in parliamentary elections. The right of initiative belongs to the President of the Republic, the Head of Government, as well as at least 10 deputies. The Head of Government alone can present bills of financial nature or aiming to ratify an international treaty. Ordinary bills are adopted by a simple majority of the deputies. The draft organic laws are adopted by an absolute majority of the members of the Assembly. No member of the Assembly of the Representatives of the People can be prosecuted for acts or words spoken in connection with his parliamentary duties. Every member is also immune to prosecution for a criminal offense while in office unless his parliamentary immunity is lifted. When the Assembly is dissolved, the President may, with the agreement of the head of government, rule by decree. The decree-laws adopted by the President must then be approved by the new Assembly at its first regular session. The Assembly of the Representatives of the People may also grant the Head of Government for a period can not be longer than two months, the power to issue decree-laws; the support of three-fifths of the members is required for the award of such power. No decree can undermine the electoral system. =Executive power= Executive power is exercised jointly by the President and the Head of Government. The President of the Republic The President of the Republic of Tunisia is elected by direct universal suffrage for a term of 5 years. Anyone aged at least 35 years, Muslim, holding Tunisian nationality since birth and with no other nationality - or formally committing to renounce any other nationality - may be a candidate in the Tunisian presidential election. In accordance with Article 75 of the Constitution, no person may serve more than two terms in office, whether successive or separate; this provision can not be amended to increase the number of terms that can be served by the same President. The President is the Head of State; he defines the general policies of national security, international relations and defense. He appoints the General Mufti of the Republic of Tunisia, the President of the Central Bank, as well as senior post holders in the presidency, the diplomatic service, national security and defense. He promulgates laws adopted by the Assembly of the Representatives of the People and may request further deliberations. He may also, if interest warrants, subject laws to referendum. President can dissolve the Tunisian parliament before its term. When the country is in danger, the President may temporarily assume extraordinary powers. The Assembly of the Representatives of the People may decide by a majority of two thirds of its members, to end the mandate of the President in case of violation of the Constitution. The Head of Government The Tunisian government is composed of the Head of Government and ministers and secretaries of state appointed by him; the appointment of Ministers of Foreign Affairs and of Defence is made in agreement with the President of the Republic. The Head of the Tunisian Government is normally appointed by the president from among the members of the political party or electoral coalition having obtained the largest number of seats in the parliamentary election. No one can be both a member of the government and of the Assembly of the Representatives of the People. The government is responsible to the Assembly. In accordance with Article 101 of the Constitution, jurisdictional disputes between the president and the Head of Government may be resolved by the Constitutional Court within a week. =Judicial power= The judiciary is independent and neutral. Judges enjoy immunity from prosecution. The free and independent exercise of the legal profession is guaranteed. Justice system, administrative and financial judiciary Judges are appointed by decree of the President on the advice of the Supreme Judicial Council; appointments to high office are made in consultation with the Head of Government. Judges can not be dismissed or suspended; they can not be transferred without their consent. Disciplinary sanctions fall under the Supreme Judicial Council. Everyone has the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time and has the right to appeal the judgment. Court hearings are public. Any interference in the work of justice is prohibited. The creation of special courts is not permitted; Military courts have jurisdiction only to prosecute military crimes.

Each organ is composed two-thirds of magistrates elected or appointed to official functions, with the remaining third being composed of non-judicial independent experts. The majority of members of these bodies are to be elected; their term of office is six years and is not renewable. The General Assembly of the three judicial councils decides on bills concerning the judicial system. The three councils decide on matters concerning the career and discipline of judges. The Supreme Judicial Council prepares an annual report and send a copy to the President of the Republic, the head of government, and the President of the Assembly of the Representatives of the People. =The judicial system= The judiciary consists courts of first instance, courts of second instance and the Court of Cassation. The Court of Cassation must submit and publish an annual report.

Bate was born April 10, 1934, in Passaic, New Jersey, the son of William Warren Bate and Winifred Irene King Bate. He graduated from Public School No. 1 in Clifton, St. Peter's Prep in Jersey City in 1951, St. Peter's College in Jersey City in 1955, and Georgetown University Law School in 1958. (Bate later enrolled and earned a Master's Degree in American Political Systems from Rutgers University while serving in the legislature.) He spent six years as a legislative assistant to Congressman Charles Samuel Joelson, a Democrat from New Jersey. He was elected to the Clifton City Council in 1966, and won election to the Passaic County Board of Chosen Freeholders in 1968. He served as Freeholder Director in 1971. In 1971, Bate was elected to the New Jersey State Senate. Passaic County had three Senate seats, all elected at-large, and none of the three Fourteenth District incumbent Republicans sought re- election. Bate finished third, defeating Republican Assemblyman Alfred Fontanella by nearly 8,000 votes. Redistricting for the 1973 elections created single-member Senate districts and put Bate in the same district as another Democratic state senator, Joseph Hirkala. Rather than challenge Hirkala in a primary, Bate instead chose to run for the New Jersey General Assembly and was elected to represent the 34th district. He was re-elected in 1975, 1977 and 1979. Following the 1981 redistricting, Bate was placed in the newly-drawn 34th district, which included parts of Passaic and Essex counties. (Hirkala ran in the Passaic-Bergen 36th district.) He was unopposed for the Democratic nomination, but lost the general election to Passaic County Republican Chairman Joseph Bubba by a 53%-47% margin. Bate was elected Passaic County Surrogate (Probate Court Judge) in 1982, and was re-elected in 1992, 1997, 2002 and 2007. He died in office in 2011.

Qarachaqay Khan is seen standing on the right in a red coat, with a prominent handlebar mustache. Qarachaqay Khan (; died 1625) was a military commander in Safavid Iran of Armenian origin. He was known for his great collection of porcelain items and loyal service to Shah Abbas I. Qarachaqay Khan was killed while commanding an expedition against the Georgian rebels.  Career  Born as a Christian Armenian in Erivan, Qarachaqay was enslaved in childhood and brought to the Safavid court to be raised as a gholam. He began his career in a royal tailoring workshop and was soon distinguished in the Safavid army as an artillery officer. In 1605, Qarachaqay Beg, being in charge of a musketeer regiment, under the command of Allahverdi Khan‚Äîalso originally a gholam of Georgian origin‚Äîcontributed to Abbas I's victory over the Ottoman forces at Sufiyan near Tabriz. During his career in the Safavid army and administration, Qarachaqay amassed a valuable collection of Chinese porcelain which he presented to Shah Abbas around 1610. Shortly afterwards, Qarachaqay was bestowed with the title of muqarab al- hazrat (\\"intimate of the illustrious\\"), reserved for the Shah‚Äôs close companions. In 1616, he received the title of khan and was appointed commander-in-chief (sepahsalar-e Iran) of the Safavid army. A year after the defeat of the Ottoman troops led by Khalil Pasha, he became governor of Tabriz and all of Azerbaijan, but was soon recalled by the shah to continue his service as governor of Mashhad in northeastern Khorasan in 1618. When Abbas I decided to marry his granddaughter to Semayun Khan of Kartli (Simon II) in 1624, Qarachaqay Khan ordered Yusuf Khan, likewise of Christian Armenian origin and a childhood friend, to host the banquet in the first term of the wedding party. In the same year, Qarachaqay Khan, accompanied by the Safavid Georgian officer Murav-Beg (Giorgi Saakadze), captained a punitive expedition against the rebels in Georgia. Murav-Beg conspired with the insurgents, who unexpectedly attacked and destroyed the Iranian camp at Martqopi, killing Qarachaqay Khan and one of his sons, Imam Verdi Khan. Both were buried within a family shrine complex in Mashhad. Of Qarachaqay Khan's other sons, Abu al- Fath Manuchihr Khan (died 1636) rose to the governorship of Mashhad and Ali Quli Khan became prefect of Qom and head of the shah's library. Manuchihr Khan's son, Qarachaqay Khan (died c. 1668), was also governor of Mashhad. All of them were known as sponsors of learning and culture.

It was established in 1904. It is also known as Graceville Recreation Reserve and the Sherwood War Memorial. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 September 2006.  History  Graceville Memorial Park, located on a flat, low-lying part of Graceville, was gazetted as the Graceville Recreation Reserve in 1904, but it was referred to as Graceville Memorial Park by 1926. The park was enlarged in July 1979, with the resumption of about of vacant, ownerless land (lot 2, RP 70795) for an access way to Churchill Street, south of the park. From 1840 to 1859 the peninsula that includes the suburb of Graceville was known as Boyland's Pocket, a run for sheep and cattle. After 1859 the area was subdivided into farms with an average size of about . Maize, potatoes, and bananas were grown, cotton was attempted in the 1860s, and sugar cane was produced until a cold spell in the 1870s. The area was relatively isolated from Brisbane until the railway line from Ipswich crossed the river from Chelmer to Indooroopilly in 1875. Graceville's subdivision for residential housing started during the building boom of the 1880s, and the Graceville railway station was opened in 1886. The Shire of Sherwood was created in 1891, excised from the Yeerongpilly Division (created in 1879). From the late 1880s onwards there was an increased interest in Queensland in healthy outdoor recreation, and the flood-prone grassland on which the park was later sited was used as a lacrosse field in the 1890s. The formation of sporting clubs in Queensland led to pressure on local councils to provide facilities, and in May 1904 fourteen acres of this grassland was gazetted as the Graceville Recreation Reserve by the Queensland government. The reserve was vested in the Sherwood Shire Council, to be held in trust for recreation purposes, and the park's primary role since then has been as a leased venue for various team sports, mainly cricket and hockey, but also including soccer, rugby league, and Australian Rules football. A croquet club and a tennis club were also established. Other users included the Graceville Methodist Sunday School, which held classes in a ground shed on the reserve between November 1914 and November 1917, and a bridge club, which was formed at the croquet club premises around 1929. Aviators may have also used the park as an aerodrome in the 1920s. The outpouring of grief in Australia that accompanied the deaths, and overseas burial, of 60,000 service people in World War I, led to a period of memorial building across the nation. A memorial was unveiled in Graceville Recreational Reserve on 28 November 1920 by Lieutenant E.M. Little, chairman of the local R.S.S.A.L.I.A. Funded by public subscriptions, the memorial was designed by Mr I Bennet, and was erected by Andrew Lang Petrie Monumental Works, at a cost of . On a copper scroll made by Ernest Gunderson, 51 soldiers and one nursing sister were included in a list of Sherwood Shire's fallen. 265 men, and seven nurses had enlisted from the Shire. Between 1985 and 1996, a low sandstone wall was built around the monument, and three flagpoles were set to the west. Plaques representing each of the three armed services have also been added to the north, east and west sides of the monument since 1985. In 2004 sandstone pavers replaced the bitumen that had been laid around the monument. Before the unveiling of the memorial, 52 memorial trees were also planted. Bunya pines and cotton trees were set in a single row along Plumridge Street and Appel Street (then called Graceville Parade) to commemorate the dead. Today, 29 bunya pines and 11 cotton trees remain. Some locals claim that there were memorial plaques on these trees, but that the plaques had gone by the 1950s. In addition to the memorial trees on the western and northern edges of the park, an avenue of bauhinias, cabbage tree palms and Chinese elms was planted either side of a drive from Oxley Road to the memorial. A single line of figs and camphor laurels continued west from the memorial towards Appel Street. The eastern section of the drive had a bitumen surface by 1961, but the western section of the memorial drive, from the memorial to Appel Street, has reverted to grass. A trophy field gun captured by the Australian Imperial Force near Abancourt, France, in August 1918 was also sited near the memorial from the early 1920s, but it was removed before 1952. In 1925 the Sherwood Shire was incorporated in the City of Greater Brisbane, and the recreation reserve is referred to as Graceville Memorial Park in the 1926 Park Schedule for the City. However, the emphasis on sports had continued. By 1924 the park contained three cricket ovals, with a shelter and dressing sheds, three croquet lawns, and two tennis courts. The Graceville Croquet Club was formed in March 1919, with Thomas Murray Hall, Member of the Queensland Legislative Council, as its first Patron. A number of returned servicemen were settling in area at this time, and their wives wanted their own sporting activities. The Sherwood Shire Council leased a portion of the park to the croquet club in May 1919. The southernmost of the three croquet lawns remained as rough grass until 1923, and the croquet clubhouse was probably built between 1924 and 1929. The clubhouse has received a small extension to the north since 1985. The Brisbane City Council continues to lease the premises to the club. Grandstand, 2014 The Western Suburbs District Cricket Club was formed in 1921, and it has had an association with the park since 1924. In 1928 the Queensland Cricket association took out a twenty-year lease on playing ovals one and two, and a seasonal lease on oval three. The grandstand facing the number one oval was opened in September 1936. The Brisbane City Council Register of new buildings lists the grandstand on 13 February 1936, with H. Sanham as the contractor, and the Brisbane City Council as the architect. The cost of the brick and timber building was listed at . The two changing rooms and storage area within the brick ground floor have been renovated and reconfigured over time, and the current latticed balustrade at the front of the seating was introduced since 1985. Two similar grandstands currently exist in Brisbane, one at Bulimba Memorial Park (built 1923), and one at Langlands Park (1937). Overlapping ovals replaced the three undersize ovals. The number one oval was reconstructed with ash, its sightscreens were moved, and the arris fence was removed. Soon after 1968 some practice-bowling cages were installed on the south side of the park between the croquet club and the war memorial. Currently, the two main ovals have turf wickets, and a concrete wicket stands where the number three oval used to be located. The cricket clubhouse to the east of the grandstand started as a refreshment stall , and was extended in the 1960s. Both the number two and number three ovals had their own dressing sheds, which have changed or have been removed. The current timber changing- shed facing the number two oval replaced an earlier structure between 1946 and 1952. It has been extended to the south since 1985, and a new aluminium shed has been erected nearby. Although there were two tennis courts in the park's southeast corner by 1924, the Banksia Tennis Club did not take out a formal lease until 1938, for of land. The club also built a timber clubhouse before 1946. The Banksia Tennis Club surrendered its lease in 1989, due to the aging of its membership, and a car park and a half basketball court had replaced the tennis courts, their fences, and clubhouse, by 1993. Other clubs have also used the park over time. The Brisbane Hockey Association has had the winter use of the ovals since 1941, and in 1955 the Graceville United Soccer Club had the winter use of the number four oval, an area in the north of the park between ovals one and three. This area had a concrete wicket by 1952, but this had been removed by 1975. In the 1960s there are also references in Brisbane City Council records to the Sherwood District Junior Australian Rules Club, and the South Rugby League Juniors. There were floodlights on poles around the perimeter of the park by 1961, but in 1975 the South West United Hockey Club requested new lighting, for night training. Playground, 2014 Other built features in the park include the toilet block near the croquet club, which was built in the late 1960s, and the playground, which existed between the cricket clubhouse and the tennis club by 1961. The playground's equipment was upgraded in 1968, the late 1980s, and in the 1990s. A shade canopy was added in 1993. A bikeway path, along the western and northern perimeter of park, was built about 1991. In 1996, the steamroller, which had been in the playground since the 1960s, was moved, restored, and installed inside a roofed enclosure to the east of the car park. The steamroller is an \\"S\\" type, four steam-horse power model, built between 1923 and 1925, by Marshall and Sons and Company, in Gainsborough, England. The ex Brisbane City Council steamroller is listed as an \\"Engineering and Industrial Heritage Site\\" on the website of Engineers Australia, Queensland Division. Features that have now been removed include two earth closets, sited either side and to the south of the memorial, which were probably removed around the time that the new toilet block was installed. A zigzag concrete path, installed in the 1960s, once ran through the site of the playground, and some of the tree plantings along Oxley Road, including fig trees and palms, have been replaced. Buildings that have been removed since 1985 include the timber changing shed for the number three oval, and a small shed just north of the croquet club which was replaced by an aluminium shed.  Description  Graceville Memorial Park, bounded by Oxley Rd to the east, Plumridge Street to the north, and Appel Street to the west, lies just to the east of the Ipswich to Brisbane railway line, and currently covers . There is vehicle access from Oxley Road, along the memorial drive, and pedestrians can access the park from anywhere along Appel Street, Plumridge Street, and Oxley Road, as well as from the end of Addison Street in the south, and via the access way from Churchill Street. The park is flat, and the main features consist of the tree plantings and buildings. The number one cricket oval is near Oxley road, the number two oval is in the middle of the park, and a concrete wicket is located in the northwest corner of the park. Mature memorial bunya trees and cotton trees are planted on the northern and western perimeter of the park. An avenue of mature bauhinia, cabbage tree palms, and Chinese elms runs from Oxley road to the war memorial, and a single row of mature figs and camphor laurels runs west from the memorial to Appel Street. Behind the grandstand are two mature Moreton Bay fig trees, and two mature bunya pines. The Oxley Road frontage still has some mature fig trees and palm trees, along with more recent plantings. A steamroller stands under a shelter between Oxley Road and the car park. Further west is the cricket clubhouse, a single-story timber building, with a low-pitched skillion roof clad in galvanised iron. A sightboard stands just to the north of the clubhouse, and across the number one oval, a second sightboard stands among the memorial trees on Plumridge Street. = The Cricket Grandstand = The cricket grandstand that faces the number one oval is a rectangular pavilion, with a timber-trussed hipped roof clad in corrugated iron that is supported on plain timber posts. The tiered seating area is supported on an orange brick base, which contains two changing rooms, toilets, and a storage area. The hardwood floorboards of the seating area are covered in bitumen sheeting, and there is a scorer's desk in an upper row of the timber seating. The gable on the northern face has a flagpole and a rising sun motive infill. A divided timber staircase rises to the viewing area on the north face. Below the concrete capping to the walls on the east, west, and south elevations there are decorative panels of roughcast render between the projecting rows of bricks. = War Memorial = The war memorial is at the western end of the memorial avenue of trees, at the south side of the park, and consists of a polished grey granite column set on a light grey granite pedestal, which sits on a stepped base of rusticated grey granite. Sandstone tiles and a low fence of sandstone with eight sandstone bollards surround the high monument. The shaft of the column has a gold laurel wreath imprinted on its north face, and is crowned with a polished ball, which is etched with a map of Australia, and the words \\"ANZAC\\". The north face of the pedestal has a small plaque reading The Great War 1914-1919, above a copper scroll that lists the Shire's dead in the First World War and which is inscribed Fallen Heroes of the Sherwood Shire, Honoured and in Memory Evergreen. Under the scroll is a small plaque reading Dulce et Decorum est pro Patria Mori. At the base of the pedestal is the badge of the Royal Australian Navy. On the east face is a plaque reading World War II 1939-45, and under it, is a plaque inscribed In honour of the men and women who served Australia in time of conflict during World War II. Lest We Forget. At the base of the pedestal is the rising sun badge of the Australian army. On the west face a plaque reads Korea-Malaya Borneo-Vietnam. Under this is set the badge of the Royal Australian Air Force. Three flagpoles stand to the west of the monument. = Croquet Clubhouse = The croquet clubhouse and its three playing lawns stand on the Appel Street frontage of the park. Small shade structures with seating are on the borders of the croquet lawns. The clubhouse is a rectangular timber building with its long axis addressing the middle lawn. It has a gabled roof that is clad in corrugated iron. A modern shade structure extends over the southern entrance, and there is an extension at the northern end of the building. A gable projects towards the lawn above an entrance on the northern side there are sash windows. Internally, the clubhouse has a timber floor, with walls and ceiling clad in fibrous cement sheeting. Most of this internal space is used for small tables and chairs and there is a small kitchenette and toilet at one end. Two timber honour boards are displayed. Number two oval's changing shed, which has its back to the croquet lawns, is a timber building on a concrete slab with a skillion roof clad in galvanised iron. It has an extension on its southern end that accommodates a small garage. The features of the Graceville Memorial Park which are not of historical significance include the aluminium storage shed near the croquet clubhouse and the aluminium shed to the south of the number two oval's changing shed; the brick toilet block; the cricket practice nets; a drinking fountain near the playground; the playground and its equipment; the bikeway; the half basketball court and car park; the steamroller's shelter shed; and assorted park seating.  Heritage listing  Graceville Memorial Park was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 September 2006 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Surviving as a highly visible remnant of the development of the Graceville district, the use of the park for team sports from the 1890s to the present demonstrates the interest in health- promoting recreation that occurred in Queensland from the late 1880s onwards. Reflecting the proliferation of recreational sport clubs that occurred during post-war suburban development, a croquet club was established in the park in 1919, and cricket and tennis facilities were operational by 1924. The Brisbane City Council's expenditure on a cricket grandstand during the Depression demonstrates the continued importance of sport to Queenslanders during the 1930s.The decade after the First World War witnessed demonstrations of grief for those who had died. Graceville Memorial Park's War Memorial, with its linked memorial avenue, and rows of memorial bunya and cottonwood trees along Appel and Plumridge Streets, demonstrates the process of grieving that was occurring across Australia in 1920 and is symbolic of both civic mourning and national pride. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Graceville Memorial Park has features that are now uncommon within a suburban park, such as the handsome and substantial Interwar grandstand and the extensive formal plantings of memorial bunya trees. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Graceville Memorial Park is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of its class, having open recreational space, sports facilities, clubhouses and a grandstand within a park whose focal point is a War Memorial and which is bordered by memorial plantings. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. As a large open space with fine mature trees, the park has landmark value. The memorial avenue of trees delineates the ceremonial approach to the War Memorial and effectively marks the park's southern border. The cottonwood and bunya arrangement is also striking in its contrast of alternating size and shape. A well-designed and substantial cricket grandstand enhances the aesthetic values of the park and is a fine example of the work of the Brisbane City Architect's Office in the 1930s. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The war memorial in the park has a strong and continuing association with the wider community as evidence of the impact of a major historic event and as the focal point for the remembrance of that event. The park is also important to the local area as a venue for sport and recreation for several generations, having a long-standing association with the Graceville Croquet Club and Western Suburbs District Cricket Club.

It was built from 1919 to 1980s. It is also known as Bulimba Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Park and Jamieson Park. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Part of Bulimba Memorial Park may have been established by the Balmoral Shire Council as early as , as Jamieson Park. Following the First World War (1914‚Äì18) it was opened officially on 1 November 1919 by Walter Barnes, Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly as the Bulimba Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Park, dedicated to Bulimba servicemen and women who had served in the Great War. Robert Jamieson was an early Bulimba farmer and the park is part of his subdivision of portion 7. Bulimba ratepayers had discussed the acquisition of part of Jamieson's land for a recreation ground as early as January 1888, when it was offered to them at a reduced price. Nearly of this land eventually was acquired by the Balmoral Shire Council in 1904, and in subsequent years a number of adjacent subdivisions were incorporated within the park. The first memorials erected in the park were the Oxford Road formal entrance gateway and an adjacent pillar. A plaque on the memorial pillar records that the park is dedicated to the soldiers, sailors and nurses who enlisted from Bulimba for service in the Great War 1914‚Äì1919. Between 1919 and 1923 trees were planted along the Stuart, Godwin and Oxford Street frontages. Each tree bore a commemorative plaque honouring a serviceman killed in action. These plaques have since disappeared, and only six names are recorded. Most of the surviving memorial trees are located along Oxford Street. The grandstand on the Godwin Street side was built about 1923 through local fund raising efforts. It has been suggested that the architect was George Henry Male Addison, who designed the nearby Bulimba ferry wharf building. In 1925, the park became the property of the Brisbane City Council, following the creation of Greater Brisbane. A shelter shed near the corner of Oxford and Stuart Streets appears to date from the 1920s. Other structures on the site include playground equipment adjacent to the shelter shed and 1950s Girl Guides and Boy Scouts buildings. The former Boy Scout Hut is leased by the Southside Eagles Soccer Club and has been extended. The Babs Shield Senior Citizens Club was built . Other buildings include 1980s toilet facilities and a canteen. During the 1980s the Brisbane City Council found that not all the subdivisions which comprised the park were Council owned. These were officially acquired, including the unformed James Street, and by 1990 the park contained over . The park has been a venue for local cricket, rugby, soccer and other recreational uses since early this century. It is adjacent to the local shopping centre and it is the only remaining open park land with sporting facilities in the district.  Description  Grandstand, 2015 War memorial, 2015 Bulimba Memorial Park comprises approximately of land in the heart of the suburb of Bulimba, bounded by Godwin Street to the west, Oxford Street on the north, Stuart Street to the east, and housing and sections of Barramul Street to the south. The extensive perimeter is delineated by regularly spaced timber posts, and the roadway boundaries ensure free access and visibility and plenty of street parking for park users. The ground is flat, and apart from some perimeter plantings, mostly comprises open playing fields. The park contains a number of elements intended as memorials to local persons who served in the First World War. These include: * memorial gateway (), a wrought iron arch bearing the words Memorial Park, supported by a pair of solid timber posts, is located along the Oxford Street boundary * memorial pillar (), adjacent to the Oxford Street gateway, resembles a small solid lectern constructed of concrete. It has a square base and a short pedestal with cornice. A brass memorial plaque is set on the face of the lectern. * memorial trees (-23), principally figs with alternating palms. The mature trees, mostly along Oxford Street, provide shade for spectators and locals enjoying the park's open space. * memorial grandstand (), a two-storeyed timber structure with a gable roof of corrugated iron, located midway along the Godwin Street side of the park. The symmetrical front facade is dominated by a wide gabled bay which is flanked by access stairs that lead to the raked- back seating in the upper level. The sloped seating is balanced by the angle of the skillion roof of the rear changing rooms at ground level. The grandstand is open-sided, the roof being supported by slender timber columns with winged brackets. Decorative elements include dowel balustrades and lattice valance panels. Other structures within the park include a shelter shed (s) near the corner of Oxford and Stuart Streets, Girl Guides' Hall (1950s), former Scout Hut (1950s ‚Äì now a soccer club), senior citizens' club (), public toilets (1980s) and canteen (1980s). The s shelter shed is an open-sided structure, with timber posts with winged brackets supporting a short-ridged roof of corrugated iron. The soccer club is a two- storeyed, L-shaped building with a corrugated iron gable roof. The ground floor is constructed of concrete bricks while the first floor is weatherboard, and there is an extensive timber deck at first floor level. The Girl Guides' Hall is a two- storeyed weatherboard structure with a gable roof of corrugated iron. The senior citizens' club, at the corner of Stuart and Barramul Streets, is a brick and glass, L-shaped structure. Near the 1923 grandstand are brick public toilets and a concrete block canteen, both with flat roofs.  Heritage listing  Bulimba Memorial Park was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Bulimba Memorial Park is significant as a First World War memorial park with extensive and varied components. The trees are significant for their commemorative function, aesthetic value and practical usage. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The place is important as a Brisbane open space which, unusually, is available for both organised and informal recreational use. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance.

It had a magnitude of 5.4 on the moment magnitude scale and caused 7 deaths and 42 injuries. 357 houses were destroyed and 1,130 others were damaged in the earthquake. Tectonic setting The Pacific coast of Nicaragua lies above the convergent plate boundary where the Cocos Plate is subducting beneath the Caribbean Plate, at a rate of 83 mm per year. The direction of convergence is significantly oblique to the plate boundary, leading to an element of left lateral strike-slip movement within the overriding plate. Unlike the obliquely convergent boundary in Sumatra, where the strike-slip element is accommodated by displacement along the trench parallel Great Sumatran fault, no major NW-SE trending fault structure is known in Nicaragua. The most commonly mapped faults are SW-NE trending left lateral in type. The focal mechanisms of earthquakes in this part of Nicaragua are consistent with both orientations of faulting, due to the ambiguity inherent in interpreting the active fault planes for strike-slip events. The SW-NE faulting is thought to represent so- called \\"bookshelf faulting\\", which accommodates the oblique movement along the plate boundary, combined with clockwise rotation of the intervening blocks. Earthquake The earthquake was preceded by a magnitude 2.0 foreshock, occurring one minute earlier. The mainshock was followed by many aftershocks, including a magnitude 5.2 event on July 7. The aftershocks had almost died away when, on July 25, a magnitude 4.8 earthquake occurred to the northwest of the July 6 event, with its own short aftershock sequence. The mainshock had a focal mechanism consistent with left lateral faulting on a fault plane striking SSW-NNE and dipping steeply to the ESE. Surface ruptures associated with this earthquake sequence near Laguna de Apoyo and Masaya were mainly orientated SW-NE matching the inferred fault orientation. The perceived shaking reached between VII to VIII on the Mercalli intensity scale close to Laguna de Apoyo and up to VI in Managua and Masaya. Damage The mainshock caused widespread damage in the epicentral area, particularly near the northern rim of Laguna de Apoyo, causing the deaths of 7 people and injuring another 42. A total of 357 houses were destroyed with a further 1,130 damaged by the earthquake. Most of the houses in the affected area were of poor construction, typical for rural parts of Nicaragua. The strongest of the aftershocks caused further damage due to their shallow focal depth. The shaking caused many landslides, particularly on the slopes of the Laguna de Apoyo crater walls.

A 1946 addition to the site is also known as the John Herbert Memorial Vista. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 May 2007.  History  Wetlands, 2014 The Sherwood Arboretum covers an area of 15 hectares, containing approximately 1,100 trees from about 300 species. The arboretum comprises parkland, artificial freshwater wetland and has an extensive frontage to the Brisbane River. In keeping with an international trend toward the application of scientific methods to forestry, and over concern for the depleting stock of Queensland's forests and commercial timbers, Sherwood Arboretum was established at the urging of a number of community interest groups, the Local Government Authorities and the Queensland Government. In June 1922, the Curator of the Botanical Gardens, Ernest Walter Bick F.L.S. wrote to the Brisbane Deputy Town Clerk outlining the need to establish \\"...an Arboretum near the city where the growth of native and other trees could be studied.\\" The Government Botanist, Cyril Tenison White, raised public awareness, when he wrote to the daily papers on 13 July 1922. The proposal was sponsored by the Empire Forest Association, and gathered the support of the Royal Society of Queensland, the Queensland Naturalists' Club, the Horticultural Society, the Australian Association for the Advancement of Science, the Public Health Association, and through a number of articles in the A & B Journal of Queensland. No suitable land was initially identified within Brisbane Shire. In 1925, the Greater Brisbane Scheme saw the amalgamation of local councils and shires to establish the City of Brisbane. Land previously purchased by Sherwood Shire Council was considered suitable, and a proposal to dedicate land for arboretum purposes was strongly supported by the outgoing Sherwood Shire Council. Symbolically, Sherwood Arboretum was officially opened on World Forestry Day, 21 March 1925, with a planting of 72 Queensland kauri (Agathis robusta) along a central promenade named Sir Matthew Nathan Avenue in honour of the Queensland Governor. It was initially known as Sherwood Forest Park. Many of the people associated with the opening and the first plantings are well known today as founders of the State and Brisbane City, prominent local residents and landowners, and leading scientists of the day such as: Sir Matthew Nathan; William Jolly, the First Mayor of Greater Brisbane; Archbishop James Duhig, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane; Romeo Lahey, local timber mill owner and founder of the National Parks Association, W. D. Francis of the Queensland Herbarium and author of \\"Australian Rainforest Trees\\"; and Edward Swain, then District Inspector of Forests who became Director of Forests in 1928. From its outset, the Sherwood Arboretum was focused on growing Australian trees, and especially Queensland trees. Over 600 specimens had been planted by 1929 with plans for another 400 in place. The temperature, climate and soils did not favour these early endeavours, and many of the plantings from the 1920s and 1930s appear to have failed. Significant tree plantings include pine, fig and native plum, such as: Queensland kauri (Agathis robusta); bull kauri (Agathis microstachya); bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii); hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii); Bribie Island pine (Callitrus columellaris); Moreton Bay fig (Ficus macrophylla); Queensland weeping fig (Ficus microcarpa); cluster fig (Ficus racemosa); rusty fig (Ficus rubiginosa); and Queensland rarities like Burdekin plum, (Pleogynium timorense) and Davidson plum (Davidsonia pruriens). From the west, the more arid interior and tropical north are wilga (Geijera parviflora); broad-leafed bottle tree (Brachychiton australis); lacebark (Brachychiton discolor); tulip oak (Harpuilia pendula); with the Leichardt tree (Nauclea orientalis); celery wood (Polyscias elegans); yellow wood (Flindseria xanthoxyla). Mangroves occur along the river frontage: milky mangrove (Excoecaria agaloeha), grey mangrove (Auicennia marina) and river mangrove (Aegiceras corniculatum). Examples of exotic species are uncommon, but include a Syrian Ash (Fraxinus syriaca) from Asia Minor. In 1946, a number of land parcels and some connecting unformed roads were acquired adjacent the Arboretum. This addition is now named the John Herbert Memorial Vista, commemorating the State Member for Sherwood 1956-1978, who was an active member of the local community and had a long association with the National Trust of Queensland. The John Herbert Memorial Vista is managed as an integral part of the Arboretums natural biosystem. The Sherwood Arboretum has a special association with Brisbane's renowned landscape architect, Harry Oakman, who was the Manager of Parks and Gardens for the Brisbane City Council from 1946 to 1963. Oakman had been Head Gardener, Department of Parks, for Newcastle City Council from 1940 to 1946. He later worked in Canberra, and wrote seven books on tropical and sub-tropical gardening. Harry Oakman (1906-2002) produced a major redesign of the Sherwood Arboretum, although his design was not implemented at the time. It has served subsequent generations, however, and the essential characteristics and elements of today's design reflect those advanced by Oakman by maintaining the original tree plantings and developing new elegant looping pedestrian pathways from the perimeter and within the main drive; capturing vistas overlooking the forests and the plantings; and culminating in the wharf and terminal. A report by the Queensland Conservation Council released in 1975 claimed that Brisbane's parks were, in general, often flat, lacking in trees and natural water features, and had too much emphasis on built-recreation facilities. The report argued that too many buildings, sports clubs, car parks, and roads all defeated the purpose of parks as open spaces. The Sherwood Arboretum stands in stark contradiction to this generalisation. The park's vistas, river frontage, subtropical mature trees and mature plantings of Queensland pines, native figs and specimens of rare Queensland native plums in a setting of grassed open spaces, open lagoons and shrubby borderlines, demonstrate an established sub-tropical garden character and are well appreciated by the public. Indeed, Sherwood Arboretum is listed as the third or fourth most visited park in Brisbane. The changing land use in and around Sherwood Arboretum, from Aboriginal resource, to colonial farm, to suburban subdivision, and finally to parkland, demonstrates the evolution of Queensland's history, and the process of the creation of open spaces as the area's population grew. The Brisbane City Council's management of the land at Sherwood reflected its interest in the international town planning movement of the time. Redesigns of the park also demonstrate changes in parks philosophy and use over time, with a shift in emphasis from formal genteel Edwardian avenues and strictly scientific pursuits, to the development and maintenance of living natural ecosystems with a rich and a diverse biota and multiple opportunities for leisure activities and leisurely interaction with the natural environment. Playground, 2014 The park has a long-standing and strong association with the local community. The children's playground is very popular with local mothers and children. The mix of open space, timbered slopes and forest groves attracts the use of festival organisers, wedding parties, sportspeople, the elderly, picnickers and the disabled. Current park use ranges from active to passive. Active use ranges from sports use, such school events and cross-country running, through numerous social events and festivals, playground use, weddings, cycling and jogging. More passive uses include picnics, strolls through the gardens, quiet contemplation, and visitation by tourists. Many of the trees have heavily scarred trunks and limbs, especially the long-lived figs, bearing the testimonials of the countless lovers who have felt inclined to leave their testimonials inscribed. Sherwood Arboretum continues to hold its scientific and cultural values with Queensland native specimens and plantings vastly predominant, and exotics noticeable by their near absence. Queensland kauri plantings along Sir Mathew Nathan Avenue, 2014 The original formal Edwardian layout of the park as exemplified by the Queensland kauri plantings along Sir Mathew Nathan Avenue, has given away to less formal grove-like clumpings, more fluid and more in keeping with contemporary standards of garden design and aesthetics. The garden redesign undertaken by Harry Oakman has inspired the contemporary layout, although many of the earlier tree plantings remain. The Sherwood Arboretum has a character of park planting that is a distinct aspect of Brisbane's historic parks and large gardens. The Arboretum lands hold important environmental values for the suburb and Brisbane city as a whole by providing critical water habitat for native plants and animals, by maintaining in stream water quality and for flood mitigation. It is a bird watching site of State significance and international repute, with 124 species recorded. The Arboretum continues to play a role in science, with new plantings of the rare and endangered angle-stemmed myrtle (Austromyrtus gonoclada) in accordance with the Government of Queensland's recovery plan for this species; and ongoing studies in ecology and reproductive strategies for the dusky moorhen (Gallinula tenebrosa). Boardwalk along Brisbane River, 2014 A series of improvements since 1974 has led to the establishment of two artificial freshwater lagoons, a children's playground, disabled user access, car parking improvements, a large roofed amenity block with bench seats and tables, a riverside boardwalk and public jetty on the river, and pedestrian pathway system, garden furniture, and an artistic installation commemorating the 1974 flood showing the height of the floodwaters. A toilet block was under construction at the time of the heritage listing. These structures are not considered to be significant.  Description  John Herbert Memorial Vista, 2014 A rolling open landscape provides a spacious setting for clumped tree plantings, individual specimen trees, and an avenue of mature and semi-mature Queensland kauri. The Sherwood Arboretum is bounded on the west by the Brisbane River and on the south-west by Jolimont and Turner Streets. Residential properties occur on the other boundaries. These properties are accessed from Joseph and Ferry Streets in the north; Dudley and Dunella Streets in the east; and Douglas Street in the south. Public vehicle access occurs off Jolimont Street with a 50 vehicle car park, and a smaller car park on Dewar Street directly into the John Herbert Memorial Vista. Pedestrian access is provided from the Jolimont Street Car Park; off Dewar Street, Joseph Street, Turner Street; and from the pontoon on the Brisbane River centrally located on the Arboretum's eastern boundary.  Heritage listing  Sherwood Arboretum (including the John Herbert Memorial Vista) was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 May 2007 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Sherwood Arboretum is important as evidence for the development of modern scientific methods of managing forestry and timber production in Queensland following the First World War. The need for an arboretum in Queensland was identified by a number of eminent scientists and was supported by important scientific, commercial and community interest groups. The establishment of the Sherwood Arboretum was only achieved through cooperation between these groups and various levels of government, demonstrating the importance of the project. In keeping with a long tradition of tree planting by eminent persons, the Arboretum contains plantings by the then Governor, Sir Mathew Nathan, and numerous distinguished scientists, politicians, local landholders and community leaders. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Sherwood Arboretum appears to be unique among Queensland's public open spaces and botanical gardens by its concentration on tree species native to Queensland, and by the virtual exclusion of exotics. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Sherwood Arboretum is an important example of its type, combining public amenity and scientific purpose within an aesthetically pleasing arboreal landscape. It continues to serve its original function for research along with other public uses such as public relaxation, education and leisure. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The wide vistas, the riverside location, majestic landscapes and large and small natural beauties of the Sherwood Arboretum have a high aesthetic value, encouraging an appreciation of nature and sense of place which far exceeds what its small acreage might otherwise imply. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. The Sherwood Arboretum is a managed landscape demonstrating a high level of creative and technical achievement in balancing aesthetically pleasing design characteristics with scientific requirements. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Sherwood Arboretum is important to researchers and national and international visitors for its natural, aesthetic and scientific values, and is also valued by the local communities of Sherwood, Chelmer and Corinda as recreational space.

She specializes in the sociology of mental health, focusing especially on how social inequalities lead to corresponding disparities in mental health. She is currently professor and vice chair for the Department of Community Health Sciences in the School of Public Health at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Education Aneshensel received her B.S. in Industrial and Labor Relations and an M.A. and a Ph.D. in Sociology at Cornell University. Work Aneshensel specializes in mental health and medical sociology. Her research investigates connections between how society is organized and how that relates to mental health of its citizens, specifically focusing on the way that social inequalities around gender, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and age lead to differences in mental health along those differentiators. She has worked with large survey samples and utilizes complex statistical analysis of data spanning multiple life stages of subjects. Aneshensel studied the epidemiology of depression and help-seeking behavior under a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health (1984-1987). Under continued support from NIMH, she studied models of ethnicity and depression over time, (1987-1992), sources of stress and depressive symptoms in adolescents (1988-1992), and social origins and emotional impact of adolescent stress (1992-1997). She was funded by the California Department of Health Services, Alzheimer's Disease to research the long-term impact of family caregiving (1999-2000). She followed this by a study of neighborhood, socioeconomic status, and adolescent distress beginning in 2000, and later neighborhood SES and emotional distress in old age, both supported by grants from NIMH. Publications She has written and edited several books, such as the Handbook of the Sociology of Mental Health and Theory-Based Data Analysis for the Social Sciences. Aneshensel has also published numerous papers.

Biography  His father owned a company in Rio de Janeiro and brought Domingo there to be with him sometime between 1871 and 1876. He was enrolled at the Academia Imperial de Belas Artes (AIBA) from 1879 to 1884, where he became a student of the German landscape painter Georg Grimm.Brief biography @ the Enciclop√©dia Ita√∫ Cultural. When Grimm staged a protest against the Academy's teaching methods, Garc√≠a joined him and several other students (including Giovanni Battista Castagneto, Ant√¥nio Parreiras and Hip√≥lito Boaventura Caron) in leaving the Academy to establish their own school in Niter√≥i, where they painted plein-air and came to be known as the \\"Grupo Grimm\\". This proved to be a very successful time in his life. He was awarded medals at various exhibitions in 1880, 1881, 1882 and won a Gold Medal in 1884. After the Grupo Grimm broke up, he went to France, where he studied with Hector Hanoteau and Henri-Joseph Harpignies from 1885 to 1888. When he returned from Europe, he discovered that his paintings were no longer very popular in Brazil. Introverted by nature, he became filled with self-doubt and fell into poverty. For much of the nineties, he gave up painting altogether, and spent his time taking long walks along the beach or fishing to earn a little money.Brief biography @ ArteData. In 1901, he got up the courage to have a small exhibit at the \\"Exposi√ß√£o Geral de Belas Artes\\". Four years later, he made a long tour of the Serra da Estrela, in Teres√≥polis, producing several major works for display at the Exposi√ß√£o in 1906. His paintings were praised, but were not accepted for the exhibition. As a result, he became severely depressed and returned to his aimless behavior. In 1912, he committed suicide during the evening show at the Cinema Soberano on the Rua da Carioca.

It was built in 1902. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This monument was erected in July 1902 by friends of two young soldiers, Sergeant Robert Edwin Berry (aged 23 years) and Acting Corporal John MacFarlane (aged 21 years), who were killed in action at Onverwacht in the Republic of Transvaal on 4 January 1902. The Berry family had long been resident in the Sherwood district, and were closely associated with St Matthew's Anglican Church in Sherwood Road (destroyed by fire in 1921). Both young men were members of the 5th Queensland Imperial Bushmen and, like all Australian troops participating in the South African War (Boer War) of 1899‚Äì1902, were volunteers. As members of the QIB, however, they were under British command, and their pay was issued by the colonial government at English cavalrymen's rates. The monument was carved by the masonry firm of W. Batstone & Sons of South Brisbane, and was erected in the grounds of St Matthew's Anglican Church and Cemetery at Sherwood. The monument was unveiled by the Queensland Premier, Robert Philp, on Saturday 21 June 1902. It is one of few South African War monuments erected in Queensland. Amongst these, other Brisbane memorials include the Caskey Monument (1902) in Toowong Cemetery, the Anning Monument (1903) at Hemmant and the South African War Memorial (1919) in Anzac Square, Brisbane.  Description  Plaques, 2014 The sandstone monument is located near the front entrance gate of the Sherwood Anglican Cemetery, facing east. It stands high, and consists of a pedestal on a stepped sandstone base, rising to an obelisk draped by a tasselled shroud. Crossed rifles are carved in relief on the front face of the obelisk, which features a small cornice midway. The pedestal has two inscribed, leaded marble plates, and is ornamented with a trooper's hat and crossed swords in high relief at the base, and a rose and leaf design around the top. The pedestal shows signs of spalling at the base, partly caused by the monument having been painted, and the relief detail is weathered. Originally the monument was surrounded by a stone kerbing and six posts linked by rails, with marble chips inside the border. The memorial now stands borderless and within two metres of the more recently erected columbarium.  Heritage listing  Berry & MacFarlane Monument was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Berry & MacFarlane Monument at Sherwood, erected in 1902, is significant historically as an expression of emergent Australian nationalism in the earliest years of federation. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. It is a rare Queensland South African War monument, and a unique source of historical information. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It is a skilfully executed example of its type, and a good example of the work of prominent Brisbane monumental masons W. Batstone & Sons. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history.

Composition  Pierre-Auguste Renoir‚Äôs The Grands Boulevards illustrates the Haussmannization of Paris through the wide, paved street, and the large concrete building to the right of the painting.

The painting shows the clothes worn by the people on the boulevard in detail, from which their social class can be inferred, but their individuality is hidden because Renoir chooses not to show any details of their faces. His focus is on the effect of sunshine on the buildings and trees.

Pfister was an American woman who was found murdered on February 26, 2014, in a walk-in closet of her secluded home in the Rocky Mountains. She had been beaten in the head and chest with a hammer, ax, and lamp. Pfister has been described as having been a \\"small-town socialite\\" and was well known in her small community. In October 2014, Trey and Nancy Styler, Pfister's former roommates were charged with the crime. Shortly thereafter, Trey Styler confessed to her murder, and received life imprisonment in exchange for the charges against his wife to be dropped. Styler claimed he killed Pfister as \\"punishment\\" for adding an interest rate to the couple's rent after they refused to pay for over three months. The Stylers had stopped paying rent after living with Pfister for 2 months, due to minor broken utilities in the home that she refused to fix. Early life Nancy Pfister was born on July 4, 1956 in Orofino, Idaho, a small city on the north bank of the Clearwater River. She was raised both in Aspen and Basalt, and attended Basalt High School. Nancy was the daughter of Art Pfister, who made a fortune when he turned his family cattle ranch into the Buttermilk Ski Resort. Her mother Betty Haas Pfister was a member of the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) in World War II, who, in later years, flew a helicopter, which she was notoriously known for parking in the family's driveway. Pfister was raised in Aspen, and later graduated from Aspen High School. She took classes at Brooklyn's Pratt Institute. In her youth, she met John F. Kennedy, Jack Nicholson, Cher and Michael Douglas when they vacationed at her parents' ski resort. Pfister was briefly engaged to Douglas. At age 29 and never having been married, Nancy gave birth to her daughter Juliana. She later gave birth to a son at age 39. Pfister was greatly involved with her kids, and was a member of the Roaring Fork School District PTA. Shortly before the time of her death, she rented out her house to retired doctor Trey Styler and his wife Nancy as a way to help pay off her mortgage. Pfister abruptly evicted the Stylers from her house, and refused to let the Stylers collect their belongings from the home. Death On the evening of February 26, 2014, Kathy Carpenter, a bank teller and close friend of Nancy Pfister, became concerned when Pfister had not returned her phone call from two days earlier. When she learned that Nancy had not shown up for her job as a tour guide for two days, Carpenter drove to Pfister's secluded log home in rural Buttermilk, Colorado. However, there seemed to be no trace of the missing woman. She later told police that as she entered the bedroom, she noticed the bed in disarray, the comforter draped over the side, and the sheets pulled off one side of the mattress. As she drew closer, she noticed a very small stain of blood spattered on the bed frame. Carpenter found the bedroom closet locked, returned home to get her copy of the key, then made her way to the walk-in- closet, where she found Nancy Pfister's lifeless body. Carpenter immediately called 911, and investigators arrived to examine the body before taking it to the crime lab. Nancy Pfister had a large gash in her torso, where she had been struck with an ax. The wounds to Nancy Pfister's face were later determined to have been caused by someone beating her with a hammer. There were no defensive wounds on Nancy Pfister's body, which led the medical examiner to believe that Nancy had been beaten while she slept. He determined that the cause of her death was due to blunt force trauma to the head and exsanguination. Pfister's memorial service was held at Hotel Jerome, her favorite place in Aspen. Hundreds of people came to the memorial. =Investigation= Police immediately became suspicious when they received information that Pfister had returned home early from vacation a week prior to her murder. Kathy Carpenter told them that she had picked Pfister up from the airport, driven her home, and was asked by Pfister if she could stay at the house over the weekend. After spending the weekend with Pfister, Carpenter got up early and left for work, leaving Pfister alone at the house. Carpenter left a note on the door for guests, saying that Pfister was sleeping, and to call her to see if she was awake enough to talk before entering the house. Another one of Nancy's friends, Billy Clayton, said that he did not want to bother Pfister while she was sleeping, so he sent her an email. Pfister never replied. Things became even more strange on Wednesday, when Pfister's roommates, Trey and Nancy Styler, called Kathy Carpenter to tell her that they had recently moved out. They told her that they had moved into a motel in Basalt, Colorado, only returning to the home to clear out their belongings. Carpenter, as well as the police, found it odd that the Stylers had not once seen Pfister in her own home. Nancy Styler came upon Pfister's dog, Gabe. The dog had obviously been alone for a while, given that the dog's food and water dishes were empty. Carpenter drove over to pick up the dog, and decided to check up on her later that night, when she found Nancy's body in the closet. Investigators turned their attention to the mattress, where they believed Pfister had been murdered. When they flipped the mattress over, they found a large pool of blood, indicating that whoever killed Pfister had flipped the mattress in order to cover their tracks. The police believed that Pfister had been dead since Monday morning, and had lain in the closet for two days before Carpenter had discovered her. Based on where her body was placed, investigators also believed that she had been attacked by two people, both of whom carried her body to the closet. Shortly afterwards, they zeroed in on Trey and Nancy Styler, the couple who had been renting her house, because there were no signs of forced entry. The Stylers had met each other 25 years earlier, in a Wichita hospital. Trey worked as a doctor, and Nancy as an instructor. After the two were married, they moved to a large house in Kanorado, Kansas, which they had built together, and became world-renowned in specialized botany, for their shared hobby of growing the Victoria water lily. In 2000, Trey became ill, and had to stop practicing medicine. The two lost everything. After they were near fatally poisoned by carbon monoxide, Nancy had the idea to move to Aspen to open a spa, and contacted Nancy Pfister to inquire about her real estate offer in the local paper. Police had no reason to suspect the two until they discovered that they had been in a monetary dispute with Pfister. The Stylers also complained about the house smelling like cigarettes (Nancy Pfister was a smoker) and accused Pfister of blaming the smell on them, in order to keep their security deposit. Nancy Pfister was unhappy, but asked Kathy Carpenter to help arrange the repairs, as she was on vacation at the time. The Stylers paid Carpenter $6000 cash, which she kept in a safe deposit box for Nancy. Nancy called Carpenter and told her she was kicking the couple out when she returned. By this point, the Stylers had become fed up with Pfister, and told Carpenter that they would be out by February 22. Pfister returned the very day that the Stylers said they'd be gone, but they had not yet removed all their belongings. Pfister allowed them to come back a few times a week, in order to move all of their belongings to the motel in Basalt. When the couple failed to do so in a timely manner, Pfister began locking the house in the day while she went to work. After Nancy Pfister's body was discovered, the two were separately questioned by police, to which they both denied any involvement in the crime. Trey Styler took and failed a polygraph test, which added to investigators' suspicions, but they could not make a murder case against the two. DNA could not be used, because it could easily be explained, as the couple had lived with Pfister for two months before the murder. The Stylers were released later that day. A few days later, a Basalt city worker was picking through a public trash bin when he discovered a bloody hammer, pill bottles with Nancy Pfister's name printed on them, and a vehicle registration for Trey and Nancy Styler's Jaguar. The city worker immediately contacted police. Police discovered that the trash bin was just behind the motel where the Stylers were staying. Another important piece of evidence came when investigators discovered the owner's key to the closet in which Nancy Pfister's body was found just outside the Stylers' hotel room. The Stylers were arrested on March 3, 2014. Shortly afterwards, investigators developed a theory that Kathy Carpenter had helped the two commit the crime based upon multiple statements Carpenter made to investigators describing items she had seen at the crime scene that seemed impossible to have been observed. Kathy Carpenter was arrested and charged with 1st degree murder three weeks later. Kathy Carpenter maintained her innocence. In her interview with the police, Nancy Styler said that Pfister was a liar, an alcoholic (Pfister had been arrested on DUI charges) and hated by everyone in the community. Pfister had called her and her husband \\"trailer trash,\\" and said they should be living in a \\"trailer park\\". According to Nancy Styler, Pfister treated her \\"like a slave\\", and treated Carpenter the same way. Prosecutors used this to say the Stylers and Carpenter had motive to kill Pfister. =Trey Styler's confession= Less than two weeks before the preliminary hearing, Trey Styler told police that he wanted to make a statement regarding the murder. He had taken a plea bargain: Confess and plead guilty to 1st degree murder, and both his wife Nancy as well as Kathy Carpenter would be released. Trey Styler began his statement when he told the police, \\"I lost my mind, or at least my rational mind. It was me, it was all me\\". Trey Styler went on to describe how he slipped out of his motel room while his wife, Nancy, was still sleeping. He then drove his Jaguar to Nancy Pfister's house to confront her about the way she treated his wife, when they rented her home. He then made the statement, \\"I stuck my head in the door, far enough to ascertain that she was in fact in bed, and I called out her name again, and she still didn't respond\\". Styler went on to describe the gruesome details of what happened that morning. He told police that he quietly made his way to the bedroom, and while he watched Nancy Pfister sleep, all the rage that had built up inside him, from the time his health began to decline, spilled out of him all at once. He began to focus his anger on Pfister, and all of the difficulties she had put him through. He made his way back downstairs and grabbed a hammer and an ax. He also obtained orange extension cords and a plastic garbage bag, which he later used to tie her up. He then described how he struck her in the face with the hammer, over and over again, until she stopped moving. When he realized she was still breathing, Styler plunged the ax into her chest, killing her. Styler then wrapped Pfister's body in her bed sheet and multiple plastic bags and left her in the closet. He grabbed some of her belongings, such as her medication and cigarettes, to make it look like she was gone. He never told his wife, ruling her and Kathy Carpenter out as suspects. As part of the plea deal charges were dropped against Nancy Styler. She cannot be charged for the crime in the future. Suspicion remains that Nancy Styler may have also been involved in the murder. The charges against Carpenter were dropped, but pending any future information investigators may learn, Carpenter can still be charged in Pfister's murder. However, they have found no concrete evidence linking Carpenter to Nancy Pfister's death. Carpenter's possible involvement in the case has been widely disputed by friends and family of Nancy Pfister. Many believe that the police were only suspicious of Kathy Carpenter due to intense media coverage in the aftermath of the murder. In 2015, Carpenter, along with Pfister's daughter, petitioned the city of Aspen to have Nancy Pfister's name added to the \\"In Memory Of Friends Of Aspen\\" shrine in Snowmass Village, Colorado. The shrine honors Colorado natives and former Aspen residents, such as John Denver and Molly Brown. Her name was added in 2016. =Aftermath= In 2015, Nancy Styler came out with a book, \\"Guilt By Matrimony: A Memoir Of Love, Madness, And The Murder of Nancy Pfister\\". The book was poorly received in Aspen, described by the Aspen Daily News as \\"jarring\\" and \\"a giant hate speech\\". Styler describes Pfister as having Borderline Personality Disorder, and seems to glorify her husband killing her (one chapter is titled \\"Trey To The Rescue\\"), while maintaining she knew nothing about the murder. Styler goes on to accuse Pitkin County investigators of mishandling evidence - a point about which Carpenter's attorney strongly agreed - and \\"having it out for her from the beginning\\". Pfister's family, along with Kathy Carpenter, attempted to stop the book from being published, but failed to do so. Pitkin County Sheriff, Brad Gibson, said about the book, \\"Throwing those kinds of stones at a woman who's been the victim of a murder is a horrible thing to do. That's right in line with the kind of people we're talking about. You don't need to do that. She's dead, your husband killed her. Leave it alone.\\" Trey Styler pleaded guilty to first degree murder, and received 20 years in prison. On August 6, 2015, Styler committed suicide in his cell at Arrowhead Correctional Facility in Ca√±on City, Colorado. He was 67 years old.

Alternatively some scholars classify him as the first king of the Seventh or Eighth Dynasty.Darrell D. Baker: The Encyclopedia of the Pharaohs: Volume I - Predynastic to the Twentieth Dynasty 3300‚Äì1069 BC, Stacey International, , 2008, p. 279-280 As the last king of the 6th Dynasty, Netjerkare Siptah is considered by some Egyptologists to be the last king of the Old Kingdom period. Netjerkare Siptah enjoyed a short reign in the early 22nd century BC, at a time when the power of the pharaoh was crumbling and that of the local nomarchs was on the rise. Although he was male, Netjerkare Siptah is most likely the same person as the female ruler Nitocris mentioned by Herodotus and Manetho.Ryholt, Kim Steven Bardrum. 2000. \\"The Late Old Kingdom in the Turin King-list and the Identity of Nitocris.\\" Zeitschrift f√ºr √§gyptische Sprache und Altertumskunde 127:87-100. Attestation The prenomen Netjerkare is inscribed on the 40th entry of the Abydos King List, a king list redacted during the reign of Seti I. Netjerkare immediately follows Merenre Nemtyemsaf II on the list. The prenomen Netjerkare is also attested on a single copper tool of unknown provenance and now in the British Museum.T. G. H. James: A Group of Inscribed Egyptian Tools, The British Museum Quarterly Vol. 24, No. 1/2 (Aug., 1961), pp. 36-43 The nomen Neitiqerty Siptah is inscribed on the Turin canon, on the 5th column, 7th row (4th column, 7th row in Gardiner's reconstruction of the canon). Identification with Nitocris In his Histories, the Greek historian Herodotus records a legend according to which an Egyptian queen Nitocris took revenge on the murder of her brother and husband by a rioting mob. She diverted the Nile to drown all of the murderers during a banquet where she had gathered them. This story is also reported by the Egyptian priest Manetho, who wrote an history of Egypt called Aegyptiaca in the 3rd century BC. Manetho writes of Nitocris that she was \\"... braver than all the men of her time, the most beautiful of all women, fair-skinned with red cheeks\\". Manetho goes further and credits her with the construction of the Pyramid of Menkaure \\"By her, it is said, the third pyramid was reared, with the aspect of a mountain\\".W. G. Waddell: Manetho, London (1940), p. 55-57 Although the murdered king is not named by Herodotus, Nitocris follows immediately Merenre Nemtyemsaf II in Manetho's Aegyptiaca and so he is often identified as this king. Since the king following Merenre Nemtyemsaf II in the Abydos king list is \\"Netjerkare\\", the German egyptologist Ludwig Stern proposed in 1883 that Netjerkare and Nitocris are the same person.L Stern: Die XXII. manethonische Dynastie, ZAS 21 (1883), p. 23, n. 2. The Danish Egyptologist Kim Ryholt confirmed Stern's hypothesis in a recent study of the matter. Ryholt argues that the name \\"Nitocris\\" is a result of conflation and distortion from the name \\"Netjerkare\\". Confirming this analysis, the Turin canon, another king list redacted during the early Ramesside period lists a Neitiqerti Siptah at an uncertain position. Ryholt's microscopic analyses of the fibers of the papyrus suggest that the fragment where this name appears belongs to the end of the 6th Dynasty, immediately after Merenre Nemtyemsaf II. Since on the Abydos king list, Netjerkare is placed in the equivalent spot that Neitiqerti Siptah holds on the Turin canon, the two are to be identified. Additionally, the nomen \\"Siptah\\" is masculine indicating that Nitocris was in fact a male pharaoh. The name \\"Nitocris\\" probably originates from the prenomen \\"Neitiqerti\\", which itself either comes from a corruption of \\"Netjerkare\\", or else \\"Neitiqerti Siptah\\" was the nomen of the king and \\"Netjerkare\\" his prenomen.

Although most military burials take place in the nearby Aldershot Military Cemetery, there are 57 men from all three services buried in Aldershot Cemetery who died on active service during World War I and World War II.Photographic record of the military burials at Aldershot Cemetery Today the cemetery is maintained by Rushmoor Borough Council.Cemeteries maintained by Rushmoor Borough Council History The chapels at Aldershot Cemetery As the civilian town of Aldershot expanded with the arrival of the Army in the 1850s the need for a new town cemetery soon became apparent. Until then the old village churchyard surrounding the parish church of St Michael's had been adequate. The Aldershot Burial Board was formed at a Vestry Meeting on 31 October 1860, and its nine members held its first meeting the following month. They moved quickly to obtain a site for a town cemetery, and before the end of the year the Board had acquired land formerly known as \\"Bedford‚Äôs Field\\" at the foot of Redan Hill at a cost of ¬£1,700. Two chapels were built either side of the roadway into the cemetery, one for the Church of England and the other for Nonconformists. The two chapels were linked by a roof over the road which formed a covered shelter. In 1871 the Burial Board approached the War Office to request the purchase of the strip of land on the opposite side of Redan Road up to the railway line. This was agreed, and ownership of the land transferred to the Burial Board on 26 July 1871. More land was added in 1886, and more again in 1894 at an additional cost of ¬£1,050, reflecting the ever increasing demand from the expanding town.

This had apparently long since been in mind because a plan of grave spaces of the Aldershot Cemetery dated 1861 shows a portion of the Cemetery \\"allotted to the Hebrew Congregation\\".

This will help in providing round the clock power to rural households and adequate power to agricultural consumers. The earlier scheme for rural electrification viz. Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana has been subsumed in the new scheme as its rural electrification component. The Ministry of Power has launched a new app, GARV-II app to provide real-time data of all six lakh villages of the country. The app is envisaged to ensure transparency in the implementation of rural electrification programme. The new app will also enable the citizens to participate in the developmental works and can give their feedback and inputs related to the rural electrification programme. The participation of Citizens will enable public scrutiny of the rural electrification programmes. In addition, the village-wise works sanctioned under Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana has been mapped to scrutinise the progress of work carried out under the project in each village The deadline for the Centre's rural electrification programme was May 2018. However, it was achieved before the deadline on April 28, with the electrification of Leisang village in Manipur. Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi tweeted \\"Yesterday, we fulfilled a commitment due to which the lives of several Indians will be transformed forever! I am delighted that every single village of India now has access to electricity.\\" Despite this, several news reports claimed that the numbers were inflated, and villages were electrified only on paper.

It was built from 1863 to 1966. It is also known as Francis Outlook. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 September 2004.  History  Francis Lookout is an area of parkland located on a prominent hilltop site in Corinda. It contains burials from between 1862 and 1966. Arthur Morley Francis and his wife Angela were one of the first families to settle in the Corinda area bought , Portion 120, in 1862, which extended from the Brisbane River up to the present location of Francis Lookout. They also bought which extended from Oxley Creek to the present Sherwood Road. Their surviving children were Richard Powell Francis Francis, Henry Alexander (Alex) Francis and Charlotte Elizabeth Francis. After the death of Richard in 1893 and Arthur in 1902, Angela, Alex and Charlotte returned to live permanently in West Hoathly, West Sussex, England. = The Graves = The graves and trees, 2014 Their cemetery was dedicated when their youngest son, Clement, died in 1863. One acre was dedicated for this purpose as there was no municipal cemetery in the district. Arthur Francis was subsequently buried there as well as their son Richard (Dick) Francis, who died a hero after rescuing people in the 1893 Brisbane flood. The last of the family to be buried here was Mary Francis, Dick's wife, in 1937. Other graves in the cemetery include: the Jones grave, the Dunlop grave, the Clarkson grave, the Walker grave, the Gray grave and two unlocated burials. = The Lychgate = Lychgate, 2014 According to Alex Francis, his mother, Angela Francis, erected the lychgate for her husband Arthur Francis and the elaborate barge boards were carved by her friends. A small bronze plaque reads \\"ERECTED BY ANGELA FRANCIS 1902\\". The lychgate has a gable roof that was originally covered with timber shingles. These were replaced with concrete tiles in 1962, but have again been replaced with timber shingles. East and West gables are infilled with weatherboards. The original timber floor has been replaced with at least two concrete slabs. =Transfer to Brisbane City Council= In 1930, the Brisbane City Council took direct control of thirteen of Brisbane's cemeteries. At this time Frances Lookout was under the control of living private trustees being Henry Alexander Francis and George Waugh. One of these, George Waugh approached the council with the request the council take over the cemetery, on the condition of the trustees waiving all claims to compensation and that the council would undertake to properly care for the cemetery in perpetuity. Contained in the conditions that the Trustees of the land presented to council was that interment rights after transfer remained for Mrs Mervyn Alban Jones. This option was never taken up my Mrs Jones. Formal council resumption occurred in 1934. Improvements and repairs to the cemetery occurred in 1935-36 and were as follows: * the erection of a low fence on the road boundaries * repair and painting of the picturesque shelter shed * straightening and adjusting of the existing fence enclosing the graves * the provision of a suitable name board on the reserve.  Description  Panoramic view from Francis Lookout, across the Brisbane River towards Mt. Coot-tha, 1931 The parkland is called Francis Lookout and is located on the corner of Dewar Terrace and Hilda Street, Corinda. The park was previously used as a private cemetery and still contains several memorials. A timber lychgate was constructed in 1902. The park is in a significant hilltop position with panoramic views of Brisbane, especially towards Mount Coot-tha. The site sits at high, and is in the mid-range of Brisbane lookout heights. The Lookout is a local landmark, being prominent in the urban landscape of the Corinda area as well as from the cross-river area of Fig Tree Pocket. The site is generally an open, grassed and reasonably level knoll, gently falling away to the northwest corner. The boundary fence is white painted hardwood intermediate posts set in the ground with a diamond profile top rail and two strands of wire. Entry and corner posts are generally with a chamfered apex. The collection of eucalypts is especially significant, as they represent a community type that is found exclusively on rock outcrops at higher altitudes. There is also a significant bunya pine, which appears to have been planted 40‚Äì60 years ago. The site contains 10 known graves and one unlocated grave. The five Francis family graves are situated together and surrounded by a white painted fence. The other graves are located to the northern side of this and scattered in a seemingly random way. The lychgate is a small timber structure supported on posts with a gable roof covered by timber shingles. The floor of the structure is concrete.  Heritage listing  Francis Lookout was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 September 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Francis Lookout is important in illustrating the pattern of Queensland's history, being rare surviving evidence of the mid and late 19th century development of the Corinda area as a farming community. In its strong association with the Francis family from 1862 and beyond, the place is also illustrative of the contributions made by individuals to the evolution of Queensland's history. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The place is a rare privately established burial ground in the Brisbane area, and has the potential to reveal further information about the settlement of the Corinda district, about 19th and early 20th century burial practices, and about the contingencies of pioneering life. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The place illustrates some of the principal characteristics of a small privately established burial ground, including a lack of denominational divisions and the locally connected interments - especially the graves of the family on whose land the ground was established, and of their neighbours. Its layout and funerary furniture are indicative of 19th century cemeteries. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The hilltop setting of Francis Outlook with its panoramic views of Brisbane and as an example of a well considered timber framed lychgate, Francis Outlook is important because of its aesthetic significance.

This inscription is probably a memorial as a gravesite exists for her at South Kolan Cemetery 2645 Bundaberg-Gin Gin Rd South Kolan, Queensland Australia. The death of their daughter who died in 1866 was probably the reason the family grave was located in the Francis Cemetery. The graveyard in Sherwood only opened in 1871. = Clarkson Gravesite = Burials in the Clarkson gravesite include: * Jane Morrow wife of Joseph CLARKSON who died 27th Sept 1896 aged 76 years * Also their sons Joseph aged 15 years (died 03 February 1869) Samuel aged 8 years 9 months (died 05 February 1869) * Also Joseph CLARKSON died 29th May 1902 aged 83 years: Joseph Clarkson was active in the Fig Tree Pocket, being on the school committee and agitating politicians for better facilities in the region.

The ownership on John‚Äôs death then passed to his wife, who decided in 1917, to transfer the title to the Sherwood Shire Council at which time it became the Shire Hall. This building still stands and now is the Corinda Library. In May, 1904, he was engaged in the Railway Department and while making repairs at Ipswich, the scaffold gave way, and he fell, receiving serious injuries to his head rendering him unconscious for ten days. This accident caused him to be in a state of depression for periods up to his death. John took his own life by consuming a cocktail of poisons.

On one excursion, while guiding five naval ships through this passage bound for Sydney at the start of an evening, he sensed that bearings he had on two headlands were not correct. He ordered the flotilla to anchor for the night, thus disrupting a tight shipping schedule. When daylight came, a reef was seen half a mile ahead, and had they gone on, the whole fleet would have been wrecked. An inquiry was held, and it was found that he had been given the wrong deviation of the ship's compass. The Admiral of the flagship then publicly thanked the Captain Jones for having saved the fleet from destruction. * Trevor Warwick Jones.

It lies at the intersection of Simnasho Road, Wapanitia Road, and Simnasho‚ÄìHot Springs Road within the Warm Springs Indian Reservation. The name comes from a Sahaptin language word meaning black hawthorn bush. A post office named Sinemasho was established here in 1886 but closed in 1887. A post office named Simnasho opened here in 1894 and operated, \\"with one intermission\\" through 1954. Simnasho was the reservation's seat of government, in the form of a Federal agent, until near the end of the 19th century, when the agency headquarters was relocated to the community of Warm Springs. Simnasho has had a school at various times since 1874, but the most recent grade school closed in 1999. Government The reservation became self-governing in 1938. An 11-member tribal council is the main governing body for the reservation, which is divided into three districts‚ÄîSimnasho, Agency, and Seekseekqua. Three members of the council are chiefs who serve for life, while eight are elected to three-year terms. Three of the elected members represent the Simnasho District. During the 2013‚Äì16 term, they are Evaline Patt (vice-chair of the council), Raymond Tsumpti Sr., and Orvie Danzuka. Warm Springs Chief Delvis Heath is the lifetime council member representing Simnasho. Education Students from Simnasho and elsewhere on the reservation may attend school at Warm Springs K‚Äì8 Academy in Warm Springs or Madras High School in Madras. Both schools are part of Jefferson County School District 509‚ÄìJ. Warm Springs is about south of Simnasho, and Madras is another , which makes for long commutes by schoolbus. A separate school at Simnasho has come and gone several times. In 1874, the first Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) school for the whole reservation was at Simnasho. However, when the BIA headquarters was relocated to the unincorporated community of Warm Springs, the school moved too and became a boarding school, where \\"assimilation\\" was one of the Federal goals, and native traditions and languages were discouraged. Local residents have been more in control of the later schools. Built in the 1950s, Simnasho Elementary School became part of the Jefferson County School District in the 1960s. However, fluctuating enrollments led to further openings and closings. The most recent opening occurred in 1994, when 22 students enrolled, but the school board closed the school again in 1999, when enrollment dropped to 6. Culture Simnasho has been the site of ceremonial activities, including harvest festivals. Churches in Simnasho include the Simnasho Longhouse and Simnasho Church.

Early life G√ºnther Tamaschke was born the son of a merchant. Tamaschke passed his Notabitur, a wartime emergency high school diploma that allowed one to graduate early provided that he then serve in the military. He then volunteered for the German Army in 1914. From 1914, he was employed in various units during the First World War and came under French captivity during the Battle of the Somme in 1916. Tamaschke returned to Berlin in March 1920 and took part in the Kapp Putsch. After that, he joined the Freikorps. After three semesters, he left the Handelshochschule Berlin and completed his training as a banker. Tamaschke married and became a partner at his father-in-law's wholesale store in late 1922. Politically, Tamaschke committed himself to the German V√∂lkisch Freedom Party and was the founder of the Berlin branch of the party's Officers Bund. Tamaschke broke up his household in 1930, and quit working in his father-in-law's business at the end of 1932. After a period of unemployment, Tamaschke found a job in the district office in Berlin-Neuk√∂lln.Johannes Tuchel: Konzentrationslager: Organisationsgeschichte und Funktion der Inspektion der Konzentrationslager 1934‚Äì1938. 1991, p. 392. SS career He joined the NSDAP (Nazi Party member number 36,978) in 1926, and the SS (member number 851); he was one of the first members of the Berlin SS in 1927. Tamaschke rose to the rank of SS- Standartenf√ºhrer by mid-September 1935. Through the actions of Kurt Daluege, Tamaschke was made Schutzhaftlagerf√ºhrer in the Dachau concentration camp and remained in this position until the beginning of 1935. Under Theodor Eicke, the Inspector of Concentration Camps, Tamaschke rose to become head of the Politische Abteilung in the Concentration Camps Inspectorate (CCI). Through Eicke, with whom he had a special relationship of trust, Tamaschke was employed as the director (Lagerdirektor) of the newly established women's camp (Frauenkonzentrationslager) Lichtenburg starting on 1 December 1937.Karin Orth: Die Konzentrationslager-SS. Munich 2004, p. 134f. As early as December 1938, he was involved in establishing Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp, a concentration camp for women and children, and stayed on the construction site at F√ºrstenberg/Havel. After the dissolution of the Lichtenburg concentration camp, Tamaschke moved with his staff to the newly built concentration camp at Ravensbr√ºck, where he retained his position as Lagerdirektor, in May 1939. By August 1939 Tamaschke was relieved of his duties as director of Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp and released in early September 1939 from the SS- Totenkopfverb√§nde.Silke Sch√§fer: Zum Selbstverst√§ndnis von Frauen im Konzentrationslager. Das Lager Ravensbr√ºck. Berlin 2002, p. 169f. The reason was Tamaschke's private life. Tamaschke, who was married and had at least one child, began an affair with an Aufseherin (female guard). Since the affair had become public, and Tamaschke's wife had complained to Heinrich Himmler's personal staff, and given the fact that Tamaschke paid her no sustenance, Tamaschke lost the trust of Eicke, and he was removed from his post. His marriage ended in divorce by 1940. In September 1939, he moved to the Land Office near Prague. At the start of January 1942, Tamaschke was dismissed from the SS at Himmler's instigation, because as a trustee in the private sector, Tamaschke had been enriching himself with Jewish assets gained from Aryanization. Himmler processed this dismissal in March 1944, retroactively effective as of January 1942, as the allegations against Tamaschke proved to be untenable according to Himmler's findings. Tamaschke had been reprimanded for attempting to buy the Jewish-owned Czech company Nalus and Mansfeld, something which Himmler described in his official reprimand as Tamaschke taking \\"advantage of your position as an SS officer in order to lay your hands on a commercial enterprise you could not gain possession of in any other way\\".Tom Segev, Soldiers of Evil, Berkley Books, 1991, p. 95 Subsequently, Tamaschke served in the Heer and was still on the staff of the SS- Oberabschnitt B√∂hmen-M√§hren in October 1944. Post-war After the war's end, Tamaschke last resided in Uhingen, where he died on 14 October 1959.Ernst Klee: Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Frankfurt am Main 2007, p. 617. Personal life Tamaschke's first marriage would end in divorce, although Tamaschke's decision to stop alimony payments led to his being disciplined by the SS as any such scandal was seen as bringing dishonour on the organisation.Tom Segev, Soldiers of Evil, Berkley Books, 1991, p. 80 He subsequently remarried, his second wife being Emmy Hirschberg, an office clerk from Sudetenland. The marriage had initially been delayed when an investigation uncovered that Hirschberg's grandfather had committed suicide and that two of her uncles were involvement in left-wing politics. Eventually, the marriage was allowed to take place.Tom Segev, Soldiers of Evil, Berkley Books, 1991, p. 78 Bibliography * Ernst Klee: Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich: Wer war was vor und nach 1945.

O' Meara also wrote works of fiction where she explored a variety of topics from women's suffrage to eastern European revolutions. The majority of her novels contained Catholic themes and social reform issues. Life O'Meara was born in Dublin in 1839.Cooper, Thompson, and Maria Luddy. \\"O'Meara, Kathleen [pseud.

Her father was Dennis O'Meara of Tipperary, while her grandfather, Barry Edward O'Meara, had been Napoleon's physician on St. Helena from the years 1815-1818. He later denounced Britain's treatment of the ex- emperor in his exile. This was quite the sensation in 1822. For this reason, Kathleen O'Meara's mother had a pension from the French state. Kathleen immigrated to France soon after she was born with her family, who never returned to Ireland. After leaving Ireland, she lived in Paris for the majority of her life. As she was entirely devoted to her writing career, O'Meara never married, or had any children. At the age of 49, O'Meara died of pneumonia in her home 15 Rue Washington, Paris on 10 November 1888.

Calendar of the Grants of Probate and Letters of Administration made in the Probate Registries of the High Court of Justice in England. Literary career While O'Meara did not have great success at the beginning of her career and only succeeded in winning fame after much hard work, her own experiences led her to encourage young and aspiring authors. Despite living in France, O'Meara's English novels, biographies, and periodical articles found great success in her last two decades of life. O'Meara wrote novels that were focused on issues in Catholicism and biographies of leading Catholics. Her publishers tried to forestall any pre-disposed discrimination against her Irish heritage by giving her the less Catholic nom-de-plume of Grace Ramsay. This led many of her readers to believe her to be English, allowing O'Meara to be mostly well received in Protestant England, despite engaging in controversial writing topics. = Irish Catholicism = Her first published work was called A Woman's Trials (1867) about a young girl's conversion to Catholicism. After an irate reader Mr. Archer Gurney published an angry letter on 17 September in the periodical John Bull, \\"refuting imaginary accusations against his theology\\" that he believed to have discovered in this novel, \\" \\"Grace Ramsey\\" published a reply on 5 October in the same publication. She deems Mr. Gurney's opinions \\"not worth replying to\\", but adds, \\"If it pleases the gentleman to recognize his own likeness in the heterodox Mr. Brown of my story, it would be unkind to contradict him.\\" Also, she ends by thanking the periodical's reviewer of her book \\"especially for having pointed out its aim and object, which was, as he justly surmised, to bid English governesses pause before rushing abroad to try their fortunes.\\"MR. ARCHER GURNEY AND \\"A WOMAN'S TRIALS\\". John Bull (London, England), Saturday, October 05, 1867; pg. 680; Issue 2,443. New Readerships. Robin Redbreast's Victory was serialized in Irish Monthly in 1877. This work shows how improved understanding between denominations may help to solve landlord and tenant problems in Ireland. The Battle of Connemara, published in 1878, is similar in theme to A Woman's Trials. In this novel, an Englishwoman, Lady Peggy Blake, marries an Irish Protestant landlord and moves to Connemara. She is so inspired by her tenants' faith that she converts to Catholicism. = European oppression = A novel that is viewed as among O'Meara's best published works is The Bells of the Sanctuary, Agnes, published by Burns, Oates and Company in 1871. Iza's Story was her second novel, published by a London firm called Hurst and Blackett. In this novel, she addresses the struggle of Polish Patriots against the Russian occupation. She compares it to the Irish-British situation‚Äîboth Poland and Ireland are Catholic countries oppressed by non-Catholic nations. This theme of rebellion where a small nation takes on its greater neighbour reappears in some of her other works. Narka, a Story of Russian Life (1888) became one of O'Meara's other more popular novels, sympathetically depicting social problems such as poverty and suffering. While the problem is stated in an unobtrusive manner, the solution is offered through the old, yet new method of Christian charity. = Catholic biographies = She began to write biographies of historically famous Catholics in the 1870s, a literary development that coincided with her decision to commence publishing under her own name. The first to appear was Frederic Ozanam, professor at the Sorbonne: his life and works in 1876. As The Woman's Journal reported in 1877, \\"This authoress, known as a writer under the nom de plume of Grace Ramsay, has thrown off her mask, and in her latest works takes her own name. A Paris correspondent writes the Boston Advertiser that if God spares her life, she is destined to make her mark in literature.\\" Praising her for her thoroughness, the review continues, \\"She has her subject clearly defined, and its details at her finger-ends, before taking pen in hand; and, her story once begun, she has the rare talent of sustaining interest on to the end.\\"\\"Kathleen O'MEARA.\\" Woman's Journal, 3 Mar. 1877, p. 70+.

It was built in 1920. It is also known as Oxley Memorial Park and Oxley Place. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 July 2006.  History  Today, the Oxley War Memorial sits on the crest of a ridge on the corner of Oxley Road and Bannerman Street in Oxley, where it is an important visual component of the streetscape setting on a busy arterial road. The War Memorial was originally erected by local residents on a small parcel of reserved land on the corner of Oxley Road & Ipswich Road. It was unveiled on Saturday 12 February 1921 by the wife of Cecil Elphinstone, Member of the Legislative Assembly for Oxley. In 1929 Brisbane City Council acquired the land on which the monument stood from the previous proprietors who were the registered trustees of the reserve. The memorial was moved to its present location in the 1980s due to traffic requirements. The memorial was funded by public subscriptions at an establishment cost of about . The mason was F Williams & Co of Ipswich, who was also responsible for the memorials at: * Toogoolawah, One Mile, West Ipswich & Western Suburbs Ipswich (1917) * Colinton & Mount Alford (1918) * Booval & Bundamba (1919) * Boonah, Maroon & Oxley (1920) * Esk & Toombul Shire at Nundah (1921) * the Weeping Mother Memorial at Gatton (c.1922) * Warwick (1923-4) * Ipswich Cemetery Cenotaph (1932). Significance of war memorials in Queensland Australia, and Queensland in particular, had few civic monuments before the First World War. The memorials erected in the wake of the war became our first national monuments. Australia lost 60,000 from a population of about four million, representing one in five of those who served. The casualty rate of the Australian volunteer military forces was significantly and proportionally higher than any of the other combatant groups, claiming 20% of the Australian volunteers who served, and 1.5% of the total Australian population. Australia's maturity as a nation and continuing commitment to the \\"motherland\\" were proven beyond doubt. No previous or subsequent war has made such a devastating impact on the nation. Even before the end of the war, memorials became a spontaneous and highly visible expression of national grief. To those who erected them, they were as sacred as grave sites, substitute graves for the Australians whose bodies lay in battlefield cemeteries in Europe and the Middle East. British policy decreed that the Empire war dead were to be buried where they fell. The word \\"cenotaph\\", commonly applied to war memorials at the time, literally means \\"empty tomb\\". Australian war memorials are distinctive in that they often commemorate those who served, not only the dead. Australians were proud that their first great national army, unlike other belligerent armies, was composed entirely of volunteers, men worthy of honour whether or not they made the supreme sacrifice. Many memorials honour all who served from a locality, not just the dead, providing valuable evidence of community involvement in the war. Such evidence is not readily obtainable from military records, or from state or national listings, where names are categorised alphabetically or by military unit. Australian war memorials are also valuable evidence of imperial and national loyalties, at the time not seen as conflicting; the skills of local stonemasons, metalworkers and architects; and of popular taste. In Queensland, the soldier statue was the popular choice of memorial, whereas the obelisk was favoured in the southern states, where overall responsibility for the approval of war memorials fell under the jurisdiction of a Board made up of artists and architects. Although there are many different types of memorials in Queensland, the digger statue is the most common. It was the most popular choice of communities responsible for erecting the memorials, seen as embodying the ANZAC spirit and representing the qualities of the ideal Australian: loyalty, courage, youth, innocence and masculinity. The digger and the little digger statues are an iconic Queensland memorial form. Oxley Memorial Park is an exemplar of this class of cultural places. War memorials are the focal point for the local community during the solemn annual ceremonies of 25 April, Anzac Day, the Australian national day of commemoration and remembrance for all those who have fallen in war. The Anzac Day dawn ceremony, the one minute of silence, the Ode and the bugle call of the Last Post are especially poignant and moving experiences for Australians, young and old alike. The Oxley War Memorial encapsulates this aesthetic for the local community, and for the wider Australian community.  Description  Close-up, 2014 The Oxley War Memorial stands to the northwest of a small rectangular park on the corner of Oxley Road and Bannerman Street. The park setting contains grassed areas, decorative planted beds and hedges, scattered trees, children's play equipment and the war memorial monument. The sandstone and marble monument stands on a low dressed stone plinth surrounded by stone pavers. A stepped sandstone pedestal bears a sandstone soldier figure facing west. Identifiably Australian with a slouch hat and \\"rising sun\\" hat badge, the little digger stands at ease with hands resting on his rifle in the reversed arms position. Carved squat bollards stand to each corner of the stone paver surround and are linked by hollow metal tube rails to the north, east and south. A rectangular decorative garden is planted to the north and south of the paver surround. Three flagpoles stand to the east of the monument. Surmounting the plinth is the little digger statue. The soldier stands at ease with his head slightly bowed and his rifle reversed resting on his left boot. The hands are crossed and resting on the rifle butt. He is supported by a tree trunk located behind and to his right side. The west face of the dado bears a marble plaque commemorating those associated with of the district who fell in the First World War. It reads: OXLEY HONOURS THE MEMORY OF W. M. BOURKE R. PRICE W. COOLING T. L. ROWLANDS W. CROCK R. L. SINNAMON M. ENRIGHT C.H. TOWNSON J. FISHER S.J. TOWNSON A. J. GIBBINGS A. WEBSTER S. HAGGER D. WEBSTER C. MITCHELL WHO FELL IN THE GREAT WAR 1914-1919 Small marble plaques to the north and south faces commemorate involvement in the Second World War (1939‚Äì45); the Korean War (1950-53); the Malayan Emergency (1950‚Äì60); Borneo; & the Vietnam War (1962‚Äì72). Bronze military badges of the Australian Armed Services are fixed to the base of the pedestal.  Heritage listing  Oxley War Memorial was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 July 2006 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Oxley War Memorial is an important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history representing a recurrent theme that involved most communities throughout the State. It provides evidence from an era of widespread Australian patriotism and nationalism, particularly during and following the First World War. The monument provides a unique documentary record of the fallen, and demonstrates popular taste of the inter-war period. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Unveiled in 1920, the memorial at Oxley demonstrates the principal characteristics of a commemorative structure erected as an enduring record of a major historical event. This is achieved through the use of appropriate materials and design elements. As a digger statue, it is representative of the most popular form of memorial in Queensland. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Oxley War Memorial is an important visual component of the streetscape, a prominent and sombre landmark within a landscaped park setting on a busy arterial road. The little digger statue displays a high level of workmanship and design, additionally contributing to its aesthetic quality. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Oxley War Memorial has a strong and continuing association with the community as evidence of the district's involvement in the First World War. The more recent additions to the memorial for the remembrance of other major offensives during the 20th century, informs us of the historical continuity of the place, and its social & cultural relevance to the community. The Oxley War Memorial is also the focal point for the district's annual Anzac Day memorial services. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The sandstone sculpture of the little digger atop the marble monument seated on a sandstone pedestal is a fine example of the work of the Queensland mason and sculptor Frederick Williams of F Williams & Co, Ipswich. Williams was responsible for a large number of First World War cenotaphs throughout the Brisbane River Valley and the Ipswich area of south-eastern Queensland. It is believed that Williams used his young 14-year-old son as the model and inspiration for this work, as well as for his other little digger statues.

Recycling vintage textiles popular during the mid-20th Century, she both honored and affectionately skewered her Catholic upbringing. Early life and education Mary Catherine Lamb, known as \\"MC\\" to her friends, was born March 12, 1949, in Oakland, California, into a devoutly Catholic family. Her only sibling, Colette, was born three years later. Lamb read voraciously as a child, a habit she continued all her life, and also kept a journal that by the time of her death ran to 22 volumes, filled with elaborate illustrations. The Lamb sisters both attended St. Leo the Great Catholic School in Oakland, then went on to Oakland's Holy Names High School. MC graduated in 1967 and attended Merritt College in Oakland the following year. She left the Catholic church when she moved away from home to attend college. In 1971, she married Richard Daley, a finish carpenter, and moved with him in 1972 to Portland, Oregon. They divorced in 1978. Quilting Clearing out the family home in Oakland after her mother's death in 1986, Lamb rediscovered religious objects of her girlhood. She described being struck anew by the holy cards given to young Catholic children, and though long separated from the Catholic faith, she felt a resurgence of affection for these tokens of her childhood, recalling \\"the sense of promise, of security that the pictures of saints and angels imparted.\\" \\"I found a lot of Catholic mementos that really stirred me,\\" she said years later. \\"It was a revelation to me to realize I could embrace the images in a completely different way, on my own terms. It could incorporate playfulness and irreverence. But it also has a little bit of grief and yearning for the security of the past.\\" \\"While maintaining my decades-long rejection of the Church, I found that rather than feeling the old rebellious anger I‚Äôd long held for these images, I savored the intensity of nostalgia they stimulated. The irony inherent in these parallel responses didn‚Äôt escape me,\\" she said. Before long, choosing wall quilts as her medium, she would find herself drawn to \\"domestic textiles from the time when I believed and found comfort in the myths and symbols of the Catholic pantheon.\\" \\"All My Hope\\" quilt by Mary Catherine Lamb, 1987Around the time her mother died, Lamb enrolled in an art class at Marylhurst College taught by Portland art photographer Christopher Rauschenberg and multimedia artist Susan Banyas; the class explored the possibilities of translating life events into art. One of her first projects was All My Hope, a small quilt honoring her mother who, despite youthful dreams of a singing career, instead became a social worker. Rauschenberg was immediately impressed by her work: \\"I thought she was a terrific artist, thought her work was really great.\\" Cootie Quilt was the first quilt Lamb made that really felt like it was more than following an assignment, she said. \\"All the fabrics in it are cut-up draperies or dishtowels or tablecloths. And I like how these cooties are funny in a way. I mean they‚Äôre comical, but they also have this kind of outer-space, menacing aspect. And it also got me started on the idea of doing a series of quilts based on the shapes of old toys.\\" In common with many traditional and contemporary quiltmakers, Lamb constructed her quilts with secondhand fabrics, \\"anticipating the recycled-art movement,\\" as one critic put it. In time, she would become known for her eccentric choices of materials in creating \\"wry narratives that blended Christian symbolism with social comment,\\" her multileveled pictorial quilts \\"at once innocent and troubling, reverent and irreverent, serious and tongue-in cheek.\\" Lamb's first \\"religious\\" quilts impressed Rauschenberg by \\"the level of her craft, her vision, dealing with the religious imagery that can be traumatizing.\\" He became a friend who championed and promoted her work throughout the rest of her life and after her death. In an unpublished artist's statement, Lamb described her inspiration for the \\"religious\\" quilts: \\"I thought of creating a Byzantine-like depiction of the Virgin Mary... the solemnity tempered by the unlikely combination of homely secondhand household fabrics and lush metallic. It seemed a revelation to me that I could embrace the imagery in my own way, and delight in it...I didn't have to reject the beauty of the compelling, magic, historical images of the saints and angels just because I intellectually reject the dogma of the powerful institution for which these lovely images are symbols.\\" She began using iron-on heat transfers of photographic images, a decision she described as \\"partly as a solution to drawing (or painting or embroidering or appliqu√©ing) a believable face, but I was so struck by the almost eerie degree of humanity it lent to the piece that I have continued to rely on this method's power.\\" Like generations of quilt makers before her, Lamb used a familiar block construction process. She began with a full size drawing of one or multiple images she wanted to include ‚Äì then broke down the original composition into \\"essentially abstract units, unreadable by themselves,\\" which would eventually \\"coalesce into the narrative only when pieced together.\\" Individual blocks completed, she would deliberately \\"fracture\\" the pieces so that they didn't fit neatly together, ultimately disjointing the images. For Saint Anthony‚Äôs Torment, for example, a few squares were given a quarter-turn before being attached to the neighboring squares. A few other squares were completely transposed, their positions switched entirely. The process helped \\"to exaggerate the kinetic sense of these ‚Äòmoving pictures,‚Äô\\" the artist‚Äôs deliberate disjuncts in pattern alignment \\"introduc[ing] both motion and the notion of deconstruction of the subject.\\" In Saint Anthony's Torment, the viewer sees \\"an individual struggling to maintain his concentration in the face of diabolical distraction, clinging to faith and sanity while everything is spinning apart.\\" \\"Saint Anthony's Torment\\" quilt by Mary Catherine Lamb Lamb drew particular inspiration from the Book of Kells, an illuminated Gospel book believed to have been created c. 800 AD, whose illustrations embellished traditional Christian iconography with ornate, swirling motifs. \\"I became enamored of medieval depictions of these stories,\\" she wrote. \\"[T]he flat, graphic quality of illuminated manuscripts . . . made them well suited for reinterpretation with two-dimensional textile work.\\" http://www.quiltstudy.org/collections/quilt_of_the_month/qom.html/title/january-2011-mary- catherine-lamb, retrieved 14 September 2013. Rummaging through Portland's garage sales and thrift stores, Lamb emerged with raw materials, treasures to her thinking: cast-off mid-20th century curtains, tablecloths and garments. These discarded fabrics would continue to reinforce memories of her Catholic childhood, \\"when certain religious images conveyed to me unquestioned order of the universe ‚Äì with fond amusement not unlike my feelings for the holy cards themselves.\\" http://www.quiltstudy.org/collections/quilt_of_the_month/qom.html/title/january-2011-mary- catherine-lamb Among the silks, satins, brocades and metallics she gathered were \\"some hideous things I‚Äôd rather be shot in the foot than wear.\\" Some of her quilts were also festooned with found elements like seashells, buttons, sequins, fake pearls, old coins, bugle beads, and subway tokens. For Lamb, vintage cocktail dresses from the 1950s also exuded an \\"air of regal elegance like that of gilded medieval renditions of sacred subjects.\\" \\"As a skeptical adult, I conjure up these images with a mixture of yearning and irony,\\" she said. \\"I also find humor in the transformations (tablecloth into mantle, skirt into halo) and hope the viewer does [too.]\\" Using these fabrics \\"previously worn or otherwise lived with lends a whisper of anonymous experience, a shimmer of life, to the whole...For me, the spiritual aspect comes from the lives these fabrics lived. These fabrics have soaked up experience that we‚Äôll never know about,\\" she wrote. Whether eliciting memories of common Catholic childhoods, or an instant, startling sense of d√©j√† vu, many viewers felt an immediate connection with the quilts and the \\"range of emotional experience that was once played out in the presence of the reconfigured pieces of damask, cotton, satin, and corduroy,\\" castoffs hinting of unknown lives, \\"the ordinary . . . infused with the numinous,\\" she said. Studying quiltmaking at the Oregon College of Art and Craft, Lamb was aware of America's studio quilt art movement born in the mid-1960s. As did several better-known art quiltmakers unknown to her, she \\"worked with pictorial images and approached design holistically, as a painter would.\\" Shaw, Quilters Newsletter Magazine, pp. 45-47. Robert Shaw, renowned quilt curator, historian and author, met and befriended Lamb early on, featuring two of her quilts in his influential 1997 book, The Art Quilt. Michael James, internationally-known, pioneering quilt artist and author (now chair of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Department of Textiles, Merchandising and Fashion Design), was another who quickly recognized Lamb's unique blend of the sacred and profane, and wrote about her. Detail from \\"The Archangel Michael Bids You Aloha\\" quilt by Mary Catherine Lamb Regarding the question of why Lamb's work wasn't better known during her lifetime, Carolyn Ducey, curator at the International Quilt Study Center & Museum, noted that \\"Lamb was not concerned with [marketing her work]. She was more wrapped up in doing the work.\\" Further, Lamb's irreverent religious content may have distanced some exhibition jury members. After her death, Michael James assessed Lamb's stature in the studio quilt world as \\"At the top...She was one of the originals.\\" Exhibitions Lamb was a member of Portland's Blackfish Gallery, the country's longest-running cooperative gallery, from 1993 through 1998, and was subsequently invited to join Nine Gallery, co-founded by nine artists, including Rauschenberg. Over the years her quilts were displayed in both galleries, in solo shows as well as in exhibitions with fellow member artists. During her lifetime, her quilts were exhibited not only regionally but also around the U.S. and the world, including galleries and museums in Pittsburgh, Atlanta, New Orleans, Oberlin, Tennessee, France, and the Czech Republic. From 1999-2001, her Angel at the Tomb hung in the residence of the American Ambassador to Turkmenistan, part of the U.S. State Department Art in the Embassies cultural exchange program. Currently, Lamb's Cootie Quilt is in the collection of the Renwick Gallery (a branch of the Smithsonian American Art Museum), Michael the Archangel Bids You Aloha is in the collection of the Portland Art Museum, and Our Lady of Perpetual Garage Sales is in the collection of the Pacific Northwest College of Art's Center for Contemporary Art and Culture. The International Quilt Study Center & Museum owns fourteen of Lamb's quilts through donation or direct purchase \\"Cootie Quilt\\" by Mary Catherine Lamb, displayed in her home Personal life and community activism Mary Catherine Lamb arrived in Portland in 1972 and found the city to be suitably politically liberal and a mecca for artists and writers. She quickly attracted a group of loyal friends who called themselves \\"MC's Tribe\\" and stuck with her through the end. A wonderful host, she loved celebrations and rituals and was eager to find any excuse to indulge in them. Her \\"hard-core\\" monthly poker games, held in her home, had one admission requirement: the guest must be able \\"to contribute to discussions of life, culture and current events.\\" A movie fanatic, she gathered her women friends for semi-monthly movie outings. The rules: no popcorn during the film, no standing up until the credits were through. For a free spirit with a legendary sense of humor, she could be surprisingly prim and proper. She deplored improper grammar and punctuation, sent thank-you notes immediately, and set her table with appropriate china and crystal. She had impeccable manners. Lamb's income derived from an ever-changing patchwork of part-time jobs. She worked as a night-shift dishwasher at a restaurant and a clerk at the Multnomah County Library. She wrote and edited for technical firms and also worked as a copy editor for several Pacific Northwest publications, including Glimmer Train, Left Bank, Eighth Mountain Press, Mississippi Mud, and Willamette Week, the city's alternative newspaper. A spin-off from her frequent trips to thrift stores and garage sales was a successful eBay store she called \\"A Prize Every Time,\\" from which she sold carefully selected vintage clothing. An inheritance from her mother's 1986 death allowed her to become more financially secure. She left her library job but continued copy editing. While continuing to study quiltmaking at the Oregon School of Art and Craft, she was able to focus more on her art studies at Marylhurst. The Marylhurst degree, a Bachelor of Fine Arts, was awarded in 1992. Off work, in the spirit of her \\"hippie days\\" in the Bay Area, Lamb threw herself into a variety of liberal causes. While at the library, she helped organize its first labor union. Volunteering for community radio station KBOO- FM led to hosting \\"Women Reading Women,\\" a semi-monthly program spotlighting fiction written by women. In 1992, she vigorously opposed Ballot Measure 9, an anti-gay measure on the Oregon ballot. Five years later, she joined OPB Watch, a committee opposing the elimination of most of the music programming on Oregon Public Broadcasting, and in 2002, organized a letter-writing campaign against shutting down the 127-year-old post office in Portland's Pioneer Courthouse. Buckman house In 1990, Lamb purchased a century-old, ten-room, three-story house in Portland's Buckman neighborhood, in which she showcased her impressive, ever-expanding collection of cultural miscellanea. It became, as Robert Shaw described it, an \\"amazing house . . . a very personal museum of things she loved.\\" The Buckman house offered visitors a whimsical, arresting array of quirky collections. Dozens of sock monkeys lined the window seat of her bedroom. The bathroom walls displayed assorted paint-by-number pictures. Bright cotton handkerchiefs were pinned high on a wall like colorful little flags. Women's gloves, no two alike, made a valance across the bedroom window. Chinese checkerboards covered one wall. A small, serene figure of The Virgin of Guadalupe presided over the living room, guarded by a ring of plastic cootie toys. Elsewhere, other religious statuettes, holy cards, paintings and prayer books were arranged in abundance, a collection that, like her quilts, \\"both honors and affectionately skewers my Catholic upbringing,\\" she said. Spread throughout the house were many vignettes, seemingly-disparate objects juxtaposed, underscoring both their uniqueness and common spirit. The third floor was her studio space, shelves and drawers housing hundreds of pieces of vintage fabric and other oddments, raw material for the quilts she pieced with a vintage Singer sewing machine. On the steps leading up from the sidewalk, painted wooden crutches served as balustrades, and brightly-hued bowling balls defined the periphery of the front porch. Lavishly-illustrated articles about the house appeared in regional newspapers, including the Oregonian, the Portland Tribune, and at least one national magazine, including Budget Living. Death When Lamb was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004, \\"MC‚Äôs Tribe\\" gathered around her, bringing food and company to her house. Five years later, as plans were being made to celebrate the cancer's official remission, it returned with a vengeance, this time attacking her liver and then her brain. The Tribe, now eighty-plus strong, again rose to the occasion, raising funds for her care, taking turns providing meals, and simply keeping her company. She died at age 60, on August 15, 2009, her sister Colette having nursed her through her last days. To the end, she was rushing to complete a commission for Rauschenberg: a quilt commemorating his father, the artist Robert Rauschenberg, who had died the previous year. Her October memorial service, held in Portland's Tiffany Center, was attended by \\"a couple of hundred\\" of her friends. After Lamb's death, Rauschenberg took detailed photographs of the Buckman house, documenting its rooms and their contents. The results, along with Susan Seubert's photos for Budget Living, were published in a book titled Mary Catherine Lamb‚Äôs House. The home was sold and the hundreds of items Lamb had meticulously amassed and arranged throughout her home were distributed among The Tribe.

Solaris Urbino 18 from MPK Krak√≥w. Solaris Urbino 18 Hybrid MetroStyle in the new style at the RNTP show in 2011 in Strasbourg. Solaris Urbino 12 Electric from Warsaw MZA Solaris Urbino is a series of low-floor buses and low-entry doorway intercity buses, powered by diesel drive engines and alternative fuel (CNG, gas and biogas, hybrid and electric), produced by the Polish company Solaris Bus & Coach in Bolechowo near Pozna≈Ñ in Poland. Currently produced models are of the fourth generation, and by 2019 the production will start for the fifth. Solaris Urbino buses series have been very successful in the market, as evidenced by many orders in Poland and abroad. History The first bus from Solaris Urbino series rolled off the production line in Bolechowo in mid-1999. It was a Solaris Urbino 12 which in the second half of the year debuted two new models known as the Solaris Urbino 15 and Solaris Urbino 18, and in 2000 the series was joined by the Solaris Urbino 9. They have been designed by Neoplan with the participation of designers from Berlin IFS Designatelier which designed all of the next generation of the models. In the second half of 2001 and 2002 the models of the second generation were ready. The 9-metre model was then replaced by the Solaris Urbino 10. Since 2005, the buses in the Solaris Urbino series are all third generation. The third series is distinguished by a characteristic depth front bow, which allows the driver better visibility at bus stops. Special orders were delivered, in the second-generation. During the IAA Nutzfahrzeuge in Hannover, which was held from September 25 - October 2, 2008, at the same in Poland the Transexpo Trade Fair in Kielce in October 2008, had presented the prototype model of the Solaris Urbino 12 New Edition generation 3.5. While maintaining the body of the third generation, the buses in the series received a new refurbished interior from the upcoming new fourth generation of buses. Where the interior had been improved by stylistic and illumination of the interior. Also a new instrument panel and steering wheel was included for the easy operation of the bus. The shortest vehicle of the series is Solaris Alpino 8.9 LE, which has a length of 8.9 meters and from the rest of the models in the series is narrower by 15 centimetres, and for this reason received the name Solaris Urbino 8.9 LE for marketing reasons. In 2012, two new low-floor models were added to the series which were the Solaris Urbino 12.9 and Solaris Urbino 18.75. The Solaris Urbino series also includes the Solaris Urbino 12 Low Entry (from 2005) and the Solaris Urbino 15 LE (from 2008), which was built preferably for companies for intercity and commuter routes. The Solaris Urbino bus series has a bus which is built for urban and interurban commutes which is the Solaris Urbino 12 √ú (from the German √úberland), which made its debut at the IAA Nutzfahrzeuge in Hanover in September 2012. Instead of the classic box type style the bus had a bow-like cabin and the MAN D20 engine. The capacity for seated passengers increased to 44 in the front of the bus. In 2014 at the world premiere at the IAA in Hannover and at the Polish premiere at Transexpo Trade Fair in Kielce the new model of the Solaris Urbino series bus was shown, designed from the beginning in order to meet the needs of passengers and companies better.

History The band was formed in 1989 by Ron House, the former frontman of the band Great Plains. The band is named after Thomas Jefferson's slave quarters at Monticello. Soon after their formation, they released several 7\\"s in the Columbus area. They followed these up with their debut album, Bait and Switch, which they recorded at a cost of $800, and which was released in 1995 on American Recordings. This album was followed by their second album, Straight to Video, in 1997 on Anyway Records. Also in 1997, the band released a compilation album, You Lookin' for Treble, which contained singles the band had released from 1990 to 1992, as well as songs from an EP released during that time. Their third and last studio album, \\"No Old Guy Lo- Fi Cry\\", was released in 2000 on Rockathon Records, a label owned by Guided by Voices frontman Robert Pollard. Critical reception Bait and Switch received a favorable review from Entertainment Weekly's Ethan Smith, who wrote that the album was \\"short on polish, long on charm\\" and gave it a B+ rating. Greg Kot also reviewed the album favorably, writing that there is \\"Nothing new here, just a clangorous, nasty good time courtesy of some saw-toothed riffs and a supremely estranged wit.\\" Robert Christgau gave Bait and Switch an A- rating, writing that the first five songs on the album \\"rush by in a perfect furious tunefest\\". Another review of this album appeared in Spin, in which Eric Weisbard wrote that \\"House was right to reground his art, putting the way music flows and falls before singer-songwriterly commentary.\\" He also said that on the album, House begins the process of doing something with noise, but that he does not go far enough. In Billboard, David Sprague wrote that Bait and Switch \\"retain[s] the relaxed, lo-fi vibe\\" that was apparent on the band's early singles.

When the building reached its final form in 1867, St Mary's Cathedral was considered one of the finest, if not the finest, ecclesiastical structure in the colony. It was an important landmark in Wellington and its situation on Golder's Hill in Thorndon meant that it could be seen from many parts of the city and from points around the Wellington Harbour. Its beautiful, gilded statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary, high up on the tower, and the gilded crosses on its parapets, gables and tower were particularly admired features. Site On 1 May 1850, the barque Clara arrived in Wellington Harbour from Auckland bringing the first bishop of the diocese, Philippe Joseph Viard, S.M. Within three weeks of his arrival, accumulated funds collected by Catholics were placed in a special bank account at his disposal, and the site for the new cathedral was bought in Thorndon. The site is now occupied by Sacred Heart Cathedral, Wellington and Sacred Heart Cathedral School. The bishop also chose as the site for his mission, two sections adjoining this, both in Hawkestone Street, now occupied by St Mary's College. These sections were given by the Hon. Henry Petre.Fearnley, p. 145. The three sections were vested in the bishop in 1853 by a Settlement of Wellington Town Grant. This was confirmed later by a Crown grant.Fearnley, p. 146. Opening On 8 September 1850, on \\"a lovely day, bright, calm,\\" the feast of the birthday of Mary, Bishop Viard laid, \\"with a procession and all form\\", the foundation stone of the church which was to be his cathedral.O'Meeghan, p. 42 The ceremony was attended by over 2,000 people.Fearnley, p. 146 The Cathedral of St Mary was complete enough to be blessed and opened for worship on Sunday 7 December 1851, the eve of the feast of the Immaculate Conception. Some finishing work still remained to be done, but the Bishop wanted the context of the feast day, for the cathedral was being dedicated to Mary under that title. A reporter said: \\"The consecration, including the celebration of Mass, occupied something more than four hours.\\" Neighbours When the cathedral commenced, Hill St did not exist and access had to be gained to the site from Hawkestone St. The area was semi-rural and a little isolated. The expansion of Wellington was taking place along the Lambton Quay shore of Wellington Harbour and south towards Te Aro. But after the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 was passed by the United Kingdom Parliament, the buildings of the Wellington Provincial Council were opened across Hill St from the cathedral. Hill St was then newly constructed and St Mary's Cathedral was the most prominent feature on it. In 1865, the Provincial Buildings were occupied permanently by the New Zealand Parliament when the capital of New Zealand was transferred from Auckland to Wellington.Dan Kelly, pp. 15-17. Completion Building the cathedral continued slowly and in 1865 Bishop Viard appealed for funds. Sufficient was raised to extend the sanctuary and build a tower 32 metres high, whose important feature was a recess for a cast-iron statue of Our Lady which arrived from France in 1867 in time for the feast of the Nativity of Our Lady on 8 September. The statue was placed in the tower in memory of the consecration of the diocese in 1855 to the Immaculate Conception, which Bishop Viard had carried out, after he had proclaimed the newly pronounced dogma, as a specific remedy against any recurrence of the series of severe earthquakes felt in the province of Wellington over several months in that year.Dan Kelly, p. 13. St Mary's Cathedral was considered \\"without exeception the finest ecclesiastical structure in the colony\\". The expanded cathedral was opened by Bishop Viard on Christmas Day, 1867. It was designed by Christian Julius Toxward, who also designed the first synagogue in Wellington and the transepts added to Old St Paul's. Expansion Bishop Viard died on Sunday 2 June 1872. His funeral was presided over by Bishop Patrick Moran of Dunedin. He was buried in a brick-lined grave in the cathedral in front of Mary's shrine with some pomp. After the Requiem Mass and a subsequent long funeral procession around the streets of Wellington as far as Te Aro, 1,500 people of all denominations crowded the cathedral for the burial.O'Meeghan, p. 94. On 26 November 1874, Viard's successor, Francis Redwood, was received \\"solemnly and canonically\\" in the cathedral \\"then unfinished except in the chancel\\".O'Meeghan, p. 101. Redwood eventually installed a marble altar and a new organ in the cathedral but he did not think that the cathedral was adequate and in 1892 he put before the clergy in synod assembled the choice of either building a new cathedral or enlarging, improving and finishing the existing one. Constrained by the opinion of his clergy, who considered the diocese could not afford the cost of a new building, he commenced to do these things at a cost of ¬£5,000. Repainting a section of the tower proved necessary when part of the original work was below standard and had blistered.O'Meeghan, p. 173. Destruction The statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary, as it is in 2014, no longer gilded, in the cloister courtyard of Sacred Heart Cathedral. About 8:30 am on Monday 28 November 1898, the dry timber of the tower of the cathedral caught alight when a workman was burning off old paint. The horse-drawn fire engine was slow to arrive, water pressure on the hill was low. Fanned by a southerly, the fire gradually took hold, burning upwards through the funnel of the tower and downwards until the nave was engulfed. Bystanders, including Sisters of Mercy, saved some sanctuary furnishings before the fire chief declared the building too dangerous to enter, and efforts were concentrated on stopping the blaze spreading to surrounding buildings. The cast-iron statue crashed down from the tower, but was later salvaged with minor damage.O'Meeghan, pp. 172-175. However, some eyewitnesses attested that when the cathedral tower fell, the statue hung momentarily in mid-air before descending slowly and gracefully and in an upright position to the ground, where it landed completely undamaged.Fearnley, p. 148.see: Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, Christchurch describing a similar event in Christchurch 112 years later.

This projected site was changed several times, but the new St Mary's Cathedral was never built. The pursuit of the new cathedral was fruitless for many reasons, principally lack of money. This meant that Wellington was without an official Catholic cathedral until 1984. The parish church to replace St Mary's Cathedral in Thorndon, the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, was opened on 3 February 1901. For the next 83 years it was the usual de facto cathedral until, in 1984, the basilica was officially designated as the cathedral of the Archdiocese of Wellington, and, with the inclusion of the old dedication of \\"St Mary's\\", it was dedicated and consecrated in that year under the title of \\"Metropolitan Cathedral of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and of St Mary his mother\\". Architecture The Wellington Independent, in describing St Mary's Cathedral when its extensions were nearing completion in December 1867, stated that the original building opened in 1851 was lengthened by 33 feet and that the early English Gothic or decorated style had been adopted. The building was in the form of a parallelogram with a \\"lofty and imposing\\" tower in the southeast corner. This replaced the original tower. The cathedral measured 108 feet in length and 58 feet in width. The whole of the building stood on the original brick foundation, and was built mainly of New Zealand timber, such as Totara and Rimu or red pine. The outside boarding was Totara. The woodwork was painted, sanded and rebated or rusticated, which the Wellington Independent stated had \\"been found to be the best mode of protecting wood in these colonies\\" and it was applied for that purpose and not \\"for the purpose of imitating stone.\\" The roof of the cathedral was covered with slates, but for the spire of the tower 61b lead was used. \\"The building, taken as a whole, is one of the finest, if not the finest, ecclesiastical structure in the colony and does infinite credit to its architect, who has succeeded in producing a work at once elegant and durable.\\" The site \\"has also been singularly well chosen, as it can be seen from all parts of the town and the harbour\\" where its beautiful gilded statue and crosses could be seen glinting by all.\\"The Roman Catholic Cathedral\\", Wellington Independent, Volume XXII, Issue 2606, 7 December 1867, Page 2 (Retrieved from \\"Papers Past\\", 8 December 2014) =Exterior= The main entrance was at the west end with three Gothic, panelled doors. In the centre and over the doors was a geometrical pointed tracery window, glazed with coloured glass. At the same end were two pointed windows one on each side to light the aisles. The west end parapets were capped by a five feet high gilded Latin cross. Each side of the central nave or \\"clear story\\" wall of the cathedral was supported by seven buttresses. The lower aisles were supported by eight buttresses on each side. Between each of these buttresses was a pointed window. On the sides of the clear story, between the flying buttresses and immediately above the lower aisle windows, were similar windows but double and pointed. There were two gables at the east end of the cathedral, of which that covering the sanctuary was lower than the other, which belonged to the nave. Both were crowned with gilded crosses. The lighting was provided by a triple window with a smaller one of a circular form. The ensemble of architectural features gave \\"the structure a light and graceful appearance.\\" =Tower= The square tower stood at the south-east corner of the building, rising to a height of 106 feet. It was supported to a height of 68 feet by buttresses. About one foot above the third floor of the tower were four double pointed arched openings, fitted with moveable louvres for the cathedral bells. At a height of 54 feet, facing east, in a niche, surmounted by a canopy, there stood ‚Äú upon a halfglobe, a beautiful gilded statue of the Madonna‚Äù, 7 feet 3 inches in height. This had the inscription: \\"This statue was presented and blessed by the Right Reverend Philip Joseph Viard, Bishop of Wellington, on the eighth day of September, 1867. Virgo Immaculata, orare pro nobis.\\" (translated: \\"Virgin Immaculate, pray for us\\"). The east gable of the tower was surmounted by a five pointed star indicating the star seen in the east at the Nativity. On the west gable, were the initials interwoven, \\"A. M.\\" for \\"Ave Maria.\\" Facing north and south was a gilded cross. From the top of the parapet rose the spire, crowned by a gilded wrought iron Latin cross, six feet in height. =Interior= The interior of the building was dominated by a lofty nave, 70 feet in length, 20 feet wide, and 40 feet high in the centre, the height from the floor to the beginning of the roof being 27 feet. On each side of the nave was an aisle of similar length. At the end of the nave was the sanctuary the ceiling of which was executed in plaster and in the form of a pointed arch. The ceiling sprang from a cornice and frieze ornamented with leaves and Quatrefoils. The walls were plastered to within 6 feet from the floor. The dado round the walls was 6 feet high of figured, varnished, red pine, gothic panels. St. Mary's and St. Joseph's chapels, the roofs of each also plastered, were on each side of the sanctuary. There was also a sacristy beside the sanctuary. A choir loft was erected at the west end. The cathedral accommodated about five hundred worshippers. =Toxward's style= John Stacpoole, an architectural historian, in discussing the many wooden ecclesiastical buildings designed by Christian Julius Toxward, has stated that \\"St Mary's was the most interesting, being quite different from any other interpretation of the Gothic style so far seen in New Zealand.\\" This style was especially noted for his false buttresses \\"in all directions.\\" Clasping buttresses were topped with spirelets, and nave buttresses were carried above the eaves lines and joined by pierced parapets. \\"St Mary's - a church with a clerestory - had flying buttresses as well. Great play was made with valances and gable crestings ... while even the undersides of the flying buttresses were deeply toothed. It was all very un-English.\\"John Stacpoole, p. 126.

John Swete visited the area in 1789 and made a sketch of Peamore, from which he made a watercolour painting in 1794. In 1789 he noted in his journal it was then the residence of Sam Strode, Esquire,Swete, Vol. 1, p. 56 (died 29 August 1795),Date of death per The Gentleman's Magazine, Volume 78, London, 1795, p. 706 lord of the manor and hundred of Crediton in 1790,Lysons, Daniel & Lysons, Samuel, Magna Britannia, Vol. 6, Devonshire, London, 1822, p. 145 who had purchased a life-interest lease from Henry Hippisley Coxe.

Coxe\\" sold Peamore to Samuel Kekewich (died 1822), who was the owner in 1810. =Kekewich= The family's unusual surname is thought to derive from Keckwick in Cheshire, which lies close to the Lancashire border. The first family member recorded, Sir Piers Kekewich, originated from Lancashire before moving to Shropshire. By the early 1500s, one branch of the family had moved again and had settled in east Cornwall. George Kekewich (1530‚Äì1582) of Catchfrench was MP in March 1553 for nearby Saltash and was then Sheriff of Cornwall in 1576.http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/kekewich- george-1530-82 The family stayed in Cornwall for more than a century, before moving to west Devon. The Kekewich arms are: Argent, two lions passant guardant in bend sable between two bendlets gules.Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry, 15th Edition, ed. Pirie-Gordon, H., London, 1937, pp. 1276‚Äì1277, pedigree of Kekewich of Peamore Samuel Kekewich (1767‚Äì1822) DCL was a barrister and Sheriff of Devon in 1805. He purchased Peamore from \\"H.H. Coxe\\". In the early 1800s, the house was remodelled.Listed building text Samuel was the eldest son of William Kekewich (1736‚Äì1799) of Bowden House, Ashprington, Devon, who was a member of Royal Exchange Assurance. Samuel's son Samuel Trehawke Kekewich (1796‚Äì1873) also serves as Sheriff of Devon in 1835 before becoming a Deputy Lieutenant of Devon (DL). The second Samuel's son Trehawke Kekewich (1823‚Äì1909) was the eldest son of the Deputy Lieutenant. His son, also named Trehawke Kekewich (1851‚Äì1932), was created a baronet in 1921 but had no surviving son so the title died with him. With both of his children already deceased, in later life he shared Peamore with his brother Robert Kekewich (1854‚Äì1914), when the Major-General retired from the army. After Robert had died, the third brother Lewis Pendarves Kekewich (1859‚Äì1947), JP., who had lived in Hove, Sussex, moved to Devon with his wife. Initially sharing a wing with his eldest brother, Lewis owned Peamore himself from 1932. The last Kekewich to own Peamore was Sydney Kekewich (1893‚Äì1980), the fifth son of Lewis. The sole survivor of four brothers who served in the Great War, and with another who had died in infancy, Sydney had no interest in taking on the burdens of an estate late in life and promptly sold Peamore in 1948. =After World War II= After its sale in 1948, Peamore House was operating as a country hotel by 1952. In the 21st century, the house is residential once again but is now partitioned into four separate properties.

Early life Gray was born in Westfield, Massachusetts. He graduated from Dartmouth College and also studied at the University of Heidelberg. He was a member of the United States Army and trained at Fort Benning near Columbus, Georgia in World War II before moving to Albany, Georgia in 1946. Businessman and politician In 1946, Gray founded Gray Communications Systems, Inc., and became editor and publisher of The Albany Herald, an evening and Sunday paper he purchased in Albany, Georgia. In 1954, Gray launched WALB-TV, the second television station in the state of Georgia after WSB-TV in Atlanta. In a time of social turmoil in the South, Gray was named state Democratic chairman in 1960. He quickly emerged as a leader in a movement that sought to replace the more open Senator Lyndon B. Johnson as the Southern standard bearer at the 1960 Democratic National Convention. At the convention itself, Southern delegations staged a vain fight to keep the party from adopting its firmest civil rights platform up to then. Mr. Gray was called upon to read the Segregationists' Minority Report, astonishing fellow delegates with his unmistakable Northern accent. Toward the end of 1960, he refused a television debate on sit-in demonstrations with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., asserting that the black leader had \\"openly defied Georgia laws.\\" He then thwarted a local integration campaign by Dr. King, and bought a public swimming pool and reopened it for whites only. Gray became a Democratic candidate for governor in Georgia in 1966. He came in fourth place in the five-person Democratic primary race behind former governor Ellis Arnall, fellow segregationist and the eventual winner Lester Maddox, and state senator Jimmy Carter. Gray finished ahead of former Lieutenant Governor Garland T. Byrd.Georgia Official and Statistical Register, 1965‚Äì1966 ‚Äì p.1738 Governor Maddox nominated Gray to another term as state Democratic party chairman. Gray ran for and was elected Mayor of Albany, Georgia in 1973. During his tenure, improvements to every aspect of city services were realized. Shopping complexes and large industries came to town as Albany became the centerpiece of South Georgia and adopted the nickname \\"The Good Life City\\". With the opening of the Albany Mall in 1976, long-established firms closed their downtown stores. Gray led an effort to revitalize the downtown area by constructing the 10,240-seat Albany Civic Center, the second largest arena in the state at the time, and by razing an entire city block in the heart of downtown with plans to rebuild it. Over the years, Gray, the now former segregationist, allegedly had tempered his stand considerably. In fact, he began to seek allies among blacks and won support from them in his mayoral campaigns.  Death  Gray died of a heart attack on September 19, 1986 at the New England Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts. He was 70 years old.

The organisation was founded in 1979 by the German Waldorf teacher Ute Craemer together with the residents of the Favela Monte Azul. In the 1980s the work spread to the Favela Peinha nearby and to Horizonte Azul on the southern edge of the city. The project is a successful example in sustainable Development cooperation between equal partners. The organisation's main areas of work are slum renovation, Education and further education for children and young people, culture, health care and environmental conservation. The Associa√ß√£o Comunit√°ria Monte Azul today has more than 260 employees and receives around 70 overseas volunteers per year, 20 of these from other countries, in particular Germany. History Favela Monte Azul in 1981 Renovation through community work of the residents. Art education, including traditionel indigenous artwork, is an integral part of the organisation An orchestra with children and youths of the Favela. The instruments originate mainly from German donors One of the nursery schools houses ten Kindergarten groups and an organic kitchen. The organisation aims to foster children, no matter what situation they come from. This includes the fine motor control of Kindern in Favelas Cultural centre of the community organisation Monte Azul in S√£o Paulo The theatre in the Favela Peinha near Monte Azul. The Favela Monte Azul, which has around 3000 residents, was established in the 1970s during the period of rapid urbanisation due to the rural depopulation from North-eastern Brazil and the provinces Minas Gerais and Paran√°. Through the project, by means of which Ute Craemer wished to awaken some social awareness amongst her students at the Waldorf school, she came into contact with the children of the Favela. It began with afternoon care in Ms Craemer's own home. Out of this impulse to build a bridge between the different classes of Society, a project began that is still growing and continually incorporates new aspects. At present there are an estimated 32,000 people benefitting from the work of Monte Azul. Monte Azul has become an example for Development Aid and a model for many similar social projects that have come about in Brazil, such as the street theatre group Paid√©ia, the cultural and social centre Aramit√°n in S√£o Paulo oder the NGO Associa√ß√£o Comunit√°ria de Barra de Lama. Northern Brazil. Education There are some 1350 children and young people between the ages of four months and 21 years being cared for by the cr√©ches, nursery schools, training workshops and a local Waldorf school, the work being based on the principles of Waldorf education and Anthroposophy. A further 80 people with Special Needs are cared for in another training workshop. One of the principles of the Associa√ß√£o Comunit√°ria Monte Azul is to not just communicate knowledge but rather to facilitate a comprehensive education for their children and young people that enables them to take their lives into their own hands, encouraging them to change the harsh realities that surround them. Culture Through re- enlivening and cultivating local cultural traditions the feeling of self-worth and confidence of the people is strengthened. Through meeting with foreign cultures their horizon is broadened, their consciousness stimulated and they nurture a culture based on peace. In all of its three centres, Monte Azul has theatre and conference rooms as well as libraries so as to give people access to cultural content. A variety of courses, further education, theatrical and musical events take place there, with around 600 people a month participating. Besides this, they run a music school where children and young people from the Favela are able to learn string instruments, to play in an orchestra and to sing in the choir. Teacher enrichment From the start it was essential to further educate and train the co-workers, for they themselves had grown up in the Favela. In this way a culture of study and further education developed that has become a hallmark of Monte Azul. There is a three-year in-service training programme in Waldorf education that they call by the Indian name for the hummingbird: ‚ÄúMainumby‚Äù. In this way the co-workers of public organisations can train as Waldorf teachers for the accreditation of which they are currently in negotiation with the Brazilian government. In this way the Associa√ß√£o Comunitaria Monte Azul has become a gathering point for socially engaged people and educators. Basic training, internships, research and publication of didactic material and books, couselling in organisational, financial and professional issues for social workers, mentoring of university theses and other areas are increasingly a part of their professional involvement. A project in environmental education was implemented in collaboration with UNESCO as well as a pilot project in establishing women‚Äôs co-operatives. Besides this, each co-worker, also those with a university degree, does an apprenticeship in social work with the principle of lifelong learning in mind. Health In Monte Azul‚Äôs Ambulat√≥rio or clinic, the residents of the Favela as well as those of the neighbouring communities receive treatment free of charge. General practitioners, pediatricians, orthopaedic surgeons, dentists, psychologists and psychiatrists are available for consultation. Treatment takes place on a holistic basis extended through anthroposophical medicine. In the Casa Angela, a maternity home and centre for mother-and-child health care, women and their families receive medical care and guidance through pregnancy, birth and pre and ante-natal issues throughout the first year of the child. The Casa Angela is the first officially licensed birthing centre in Brazil. It aims to improve the poor level of obstetrics care for low-income families and resist the extremely high rate of caesarians in Brazil. The Casa da Trilha treats people with addiction and psychiatric problems. Besides this, Monte Azul is a partner of the city of S√£o Paulo in the programme Estrat√©gia Sa√∫de da Fam√≠lia, being responsible for the municipality of S√£o Lu√≠s in which live some 320,000 people. The aim of the programme is to try to improve the general medical care of the population. Environmental education Bio-dynamic garden in Horizonte Azul that provides the Associa√ß√£o Comunit√°ria Monte Azul with its fruit and vegetables. From the beginning, environmental awareness played a central role. Fruit and vegetables are grown in Horizonte Azul without the use of pesticides and are delivered to the kitchens at Monte Azul, ensuring a balanced and healthy diet for the children. By organising community projects the residents of Monte Azul cleared the area of garbage, introduced re-cycling and built a sewerage system. In spite of there being no municipal re-cycling the Favela independently runs a centre where garbage collectors (Catadores) can deliver their waste. They have entered into a collaboration on waste research with the Technical University of Berlin.  Cultural centre  In all three areas of activity of the Associa√ß√£o there are stage and dance performances, musical and other artistic presentations. In the Centro Cultural Monte Azul the residents of the Favela and neighbouring suburbs direct their own productions. They can attend concerts, plays and shows of well-known Brazilian and international artists, usually about eight to ten per month. Besides the productions, courses in dance and sport are offered. Associa√ß√£o hires drama teachers and actors who stage professional productions in theatre workshops with the Favela residents that they normally perform twice a year.  Concept and co-worker guidance  Once a month all 260 co-workers meet (without the co-workers of the primary health care centres) in one of the three Favelas, mostly in the Cultural Centre of Monte Azul for enrichment and art courses and for cultural exchange. Mostly something from the work of Waldorf education is presented and performed. New co-workers and new international volunteers are welcomed or wished goodbye if their period of service has come to an end. Through these regular meetings a feeling of community and the vision of its activities is cultivated and through creative activities new solutions are found for existing problems. Every second week the co-workers of each Favela meet internally for an afternoon of similar activities. To a large extent the organisation has been structured without a hierarchy and is led by a process of consensus. This means that all co-workers can be a party to decisions and take responsibility for the whole. Within this structure aspects of Joseph Beuys‚Äôs ‚ÄúSocial Sculpture\\" and the ideas on Social threefolding of Rudolf Steiner are realised. In this sense each co-worker is free within his or her own sphere of work and can shape it in the manner he or she feels comfortable with. In addition, further work on Waldorf education is studied.

In addition, ancient sources mention a quarry of lapis Lacedaemonius in Taygetus. The stone has a dark green colour, speckled with elements shifting from yellow to light green. Occasionally, the speckles have crystallised in a way that creates rosette- like patterns. It is rated as having a hardness of six or higher on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness. It appears in comparatively small blocks. It is known in Italian as porfido verde antico and in German as Krokeischer Stein. The stone is known to have been processed by Neanderthals. In slightly more recent times, lapis Lacedaemonius has been used for making Minoan sealstones and vases, both Minoan and Mycenean. It also was used as an element in decorative elements created with opus sectile technique (with examples known from Ostia Antica and Nemi) during Roman times, as well as in several churches in Rome (e.g. Santa Prassede) and in the pavement of St. Peter's Square. Its use is mentioned by Pausanias. During the Middle Ages it was employed in mosaics in e.g. Palermo, Constantinople, and Santiago de Compostela. Furthermore, Roman and Byzantine decorative stones frequently were reused up until the eighteenth century. For example, in St. Mark's Basilica, Venice and also as far away from the Mediterranean Sea as in Westminster Abbey, London. The stone from Krokees comes from a lava dome approximately 230 million years old. Its light spots are plagioclase, which over time has turned into albite and epidote. In places, iron minerals have oxidized into hematite, giving it a reddish tone. Geologically similar rock, equally exploited during antiquity, may be found on Samothrace.

Powell of Maesgwynne, who had represented the constituency since its formation in 1885. Candidates The Liberals had won the seat comfortably in 1885, with Powell heavily defeating the former Conservative member for Carmarthenshire, Viscount Emlyn. The party moved quickly to choose a new candidate and there was a strong feeling that the new candidate should be a nonconformist. Their choice fell upon John Lloyd Morgan, son of William Morgan, former principal of the Presbyterian College at Carmarthen, who was chosen unanimously following a selection conference at Carmarthen. There was no certainty that the Conservatives would contest the seat, and an editorial in the Liberal-inclined Carmarthen newspaper, the Welshman, expressed the view that unless the former member, Lord Emlyn, could be induced to come forward, the party's prospects were poor. Emlyn declined, and the Conservative choice, fell upon Hugh Williams-Drummond, a member of another prominent Carmarthenshire family. Thus, within a couple of weeks, both the Liberal and Conservative parties had chosen candidates who were of a similar age and who were both fighting their first parliamentary campaign. John Lloyd Morgan, the Liberal candidate, was thought to have an advantage over his Conservative opponent, Hugh Williams-Drummond, in that he was known to the electorate, having spoken for the former member at the previous election.

The degree of composition drift is directly affected by the reactivity ratios of each monomer in the copolymer system. Both the Mayo-Lewis equation and plot of the equation make evident that as monomer conversion increases, the copolymer composition will drift as the preferences for monomers change due to the interaction between reactivity ratios and the instantaneous concentration of each monomer. Composition drift in some degree will occur unless the reactivity ratios for both monomers are equal to 1. In this case, each monomer prefers reaction with itself and the other monomer equally. This causes equal rates of consumption for copolymer formation and leads to random copolymerization.  Mole fractions  F_1 = the mole fraction of monomer added instantaneously to copolymer that is a monomer 1. f_1 = the instantaneous mole fraction of monomer mix that is monomer 1. = Azeotropic Compositions = Azeotropic point and corresponding composition drift associated with this unstable critical point. Binary copolymerization resembles distillation of a bicomponent liquid mixture with reactivity ratios corresponding to the ratio of vapor pressures of the pure components in the latter case. Distillation terminology is also borrowed for the case of azeotropic compositions in copolymer systems. Azeotropic points occur where F_1 is equal to f_1. At these points, composition drift will not occur. The equation for the azeotropic concentration is shown below at the given reactivity ratios for each monomer species: (f_1)_a = \\\\frac{1-r_2}{2-r_1-r_2}\\\\, The azeotropic concentrations are unstable operation points, as any small change in temperature will cause a shift in molar concentration through reactivity ratio effects and cause subsequent composition drift. Azeotropic points occur when the feed monomers have reactivity ratios that are both less than 1 or both greater than 1.  Control or elimination of composition drift  The goal of engineering for free radical copolymerization is to have F_1 = f_1 over a broad range of conversion. For commercial applications, copolymer composition must be consistent across the aggregate. Batch reactors have no control over composition drift and require the implementation of engineering solutions to limit drift. Some possible reactor engineering solutions include: # Semibatch reactor or fed-batch reactor: by adding the monomer that is preferentially consumed at the reaction rate, f_1 can be held constant and maintained. # Continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR): at steady state the reactor composition (f_1) is constant and will not allow for composition drift. It is important to note that these reactors can have the issue of multiple steady states if the reaction within the CSTR is an exothermic process.

Although she showed some good form on dirt she had her greatest success on turf and won twelve of her twenty-four races in a track career which lasted from August 2005 until October 2008. As a two-year-old she won two of her four races including the Miss Grillo Stakes. In the following year she won the Davona Dale Stakes, Sands Point Stakes, American Oaks, Lake Placid Stakes and Yellow Ribbon Stakes in a campaign which saw her being voted that season's American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly. Her third season was disrupted by illness and injury but she did win the Honey Fox Stakes and the Ballston Spa Handicap. In her final season Wait A While won the San Gorgonio Handicap and recorded repeat victories in the Ballston Spa Handicap and the Yellow Ribbon Stakes. Her racing career ended controversially when she was disqualified for failing a drug test after finishing third in the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf. Background Wait A While is a gray mare bred in Kentucky by W. S. Farish & W. Temple Webber Jr. She was sired by the 1995 American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt Maria's Mon, whose other progeny included the Kentucky Derby winners Monarchos and Super Saver. Wait A While was the first of four recorded foals produced by her dam Flirtatious, who won four minor races from twelve stats. Flirtatious's dam Grand Charmer was a half- sister of the dam of the Preakness Stakes winner Lookin At Lucky, and a more distant relative of the Irish Derby winner Sir Harry Lewis. In September 2004 the yearling filly was consigned by Lane's End to the Keeneland sale and was bought for $50,000 by Tim Hamm. In February 2005, she returned to the sales ring at Ocala, Florida and was sold for $260,000 to Ocala Horses. She raced in the ownership of the Arindel Farms and was sent into training with Todd Pletcher. Racing career =2005: two-year-old season= On her track debut, Wait A While finished fifth in a maiden race over six furlongs on dirt at Saratoga Race Course on August 29, 2005. A month later she was switched to the turf surface at Belmont Park and won a one-mile maiden, taking the lead on the final turn and drawing away in the closing stages to win by five lengths under a ride from John Velazquez. On the dirt at Belmont on 23 October she started the 1.6/1 favorite for the nine furlong Miss Grillo Stakes in which she was ridden as on her debut by Jerry Bailey. She took the lead from the start and was never challenged, winning by six and a half lengths from Swap Fliparoo. The filly was then moved up in class for the Grade II Demoiselle Stakes over nine furlongs at Aqueduct Racetrack in November. After showing some reluctance to enter the starting gate she set a \\"dawdling\\" for three- quarters of a mile before tiring to finish third behind Wonder Lady Anne L and Cinderella's Dream. =2006: three-year-old season= Wait A While began her championship season with two races at Gulfstream Park, in both of which she was ridden by Velazquez. On February 4, racing on a sloppy track she won the Grade II Davona Dale Stakes by fourteen lengths from Teammate with Wonder Lady Anne L in third. She had delayed the start of the race for several minutes as she refused to enter the gate. After the race Pletcher admitted that while he believed the filly was better suited by grass, he felt obliged to follow the Kentucky Oaks trail. In March she started favorite for the Bonnie Miss Stakes but after racing in second for most of the nine furlong distance she faded in the closing stages to finish third behind Teammate and Wonder Lady Anne L. She was then moved up to Grade I class for the Ashland Stakes (a major trial for the Kentucky Oaks) at Keeneland on April 8. She was once again reluctant to enter the starting gate even after Velazquez dismounted, before finishing second, six and a half lengths behind the winner Bushfire. Garrett Gomez, who became the filly's regular jockey, took over the ride when Wait A While (after completing a series of starting gate tests) contested the 132nd running of the Kentucky Oaks at Churchill Downs on May 5 and started the 8.3/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Balance, Bushfire and Wonder Lady Anne L. She finished fourth of the fourteen runners behind the 47/1 outsider Lemons Forever, Ermine and Bushfire, but was promoted to third after Bushfire was disqualified for causing interference in the closing stages. Wait A While was dropped in class for the Grade III Sands Point Stakes over nine furlongs at Belmont on June 3 and started the 0.5/1 favorite against three opponents. The race was run on a sloppy dirt track having been transferred from the waterlogged turf course. She led from the start before going clear approaching the straight and won by four and a half lengths from Diamond Spirit. Wait A While returned to Grade I class for the American Oaks on turf at Hollywood Park Racetrack on July 2 and started 2.9/1 third favorite behind the Japanese filly Asahi Rising (third in the Yushun Himba) and the Honeymoon Handicap winner Attima. After racing in fourth place she survived a bump a quarter of a mile from the finish before taking the lead and drawing clear to win by four and a half lengths from Asahi Rising with the Canadian filly Arravale in third. After the race her owner's racing manager Cody Richardson said that the filly would probably stick to turf racing in the immediate future observing \\"she's obviously a very competitive filly on the dirt as well, but after a performance like this against this caliber of fillies, you'd have to think she'd be here for a while\\". In the Grade II Lake Placid Stakes on turf at Saratoga on August 18 she started 1.05/1 favorite against four opponents and won for the third time in a row, beating the French-bred Regret Stakes winner Lady of Venice by four and three quarter lengths. Pletcher described her win as \\"a dominant performance\\", and added \\"She is one of those special fillies that can do a little bit of everything. She's actually competitive on dirt, but this is her true calling: on the turf.\\" Gomez commented; \\"this is a beautiful filly. When I asked her, she just exploded for me\\". On September 30, Wait A While was matched against older fillies and mares for the first time in the Grade I Yellow Ribbon Stakes over ten furlongs at Santa Anita Park and started the 0.7/1 favorite against seven opponents including Three Degrees (Honeymoon Handicap), Moscow Burning (Sheepshead Bay Stakes) and Dancing Edie (John C. Mabee Handicap). She tracked the leader Dancing Edie, before taking the lead approaching the stretch and going clear to win by four and a half lengths. Dancing Edie took second place by a neck from Three Degrees. Gomez commented \\"all I can say is that everything she's done has been impressive...I'm really glad Todd decided to put her on the grass.\\" Wait A While ended her second season by contesting the eighth running of the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf run that year at Churchill Downs. She started 2.3/1 second favorite behind the British mare Ouija Board who had won the race in 2004. Wait A While raced in fifth place before moving up to third on the final turn but could make no further progress and finished fourth behind Ouija Board, Film Maker and Honey Ryder, being the first three-year-old to finish. =2007: four-year-old season= As in the previous year, Wait A While began her third season at Gulfstream. John Velazquez took the ride in the Grade III Honey Fox Stakes in which the filly started 0.4/1 favorite and won by one and a quarter lengths from Precious Kitten after leading from the start. Velazquez said \\"she was awesome. I gave her one spank and she took off.\\" She was reunited with Gomez and started favorite for the Grade III Jenny Wiley Stakes at Keeneland in April but finished fifth of the six runners behind My Typhoon (to whom she was conceding four pounds), almost seven lengths behind the winner. Wait A While started favorite again for the Just A Game Handicap at Belmont on June 9, but again proved no match for My Typhoon (at level weights), beaten three and three quarter lengths into second place. The filly was sent to contest the CashCall Mile Invitational Stakes but was scratched from the race after developing a fever. Wait A While met My Typhoon for the third time in the Grade II Ballston Spa Handicap at Saratoga on August 23 and started 3/1 second favorite behind her rival, from whom she was receiving one pound. The filly recovered from a bump at the start to settle in fifth place before taking the lead on the outside entering the stretch and winning by two and a quarter lengths from Vacare, with My Typhoon in sixth. After the race Pletcher said \\"people may have lost some respect for her... things haven‚Äôt gone exactly right with her... she showed today that she is as good as she has ever been.\\" Wait A While started odds-on favorite for the Grade I Flower Bowl Invitational Stakes at Belmont on September 29, but, after racing in second place on the outside for most of the way she faded in the stretch and finished third, beaten three quarters of a length and half a length by Lahudood and Rosinka. Plans to race the filly in the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf were abandoned after she sustained a knee injury. On her final appearance of the season, Wait A While started 6/5 favorite for the Matriarch Stakes at Hollywood Park on 25 November and finished second to Precious Kitten, with Lady of Venice and Live Life in third and fourth. =2008: five-year-old season= On January 14, 2008 at Santa Anita, Wait A While contested the Grade II San Gorgonio Handicap a race which had been postponed for a week as the racecourse struggled with drainage problems caused by the newly installed Cushion Track. Starting the odds-on favorite against four opponents, she raced in third place before taking the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish and winning by one and a half lengths from Lavender Sky. Commenting on the mare's relatively unimpressive performance, Gomez said \\"She was looking around, and I couldn‚Äôt get her focused on her task [but] when I found a spot, she did what she was supposed to do\\". Wait A While then sustained a stress fracture to her left tibia and was off the course for more than six months. Wait A While returned for the Grade I Diana Stakes at Saratoga on 26 July. Ridden for the first and only time by Rafael Bejarano she was made the 3.05/1 favorite but finished seventh of the ten runners almost six lengths behind the winner Forever Together. On August 21, the mare attempted to repeat her 2007 success in the Ballston Spa Handicap and started the 0.85/1 favorite against four opponents. With John Velazquez reclaiming the ride, Wait A While tracked the leader Sharp Susan before taking the lead entering the stretch and held off the challenge of Carriage Trail to win by a length. Pletcher expressed the view that the firmer ground had been the key to the mare's improved performance and added \\"She's a special filly... she's won some tremendous races. This is her fourth year at Saratoga, so when you have one that long, it gets a little extra special\\". On 27 September, Wait A While attempted to become the first horse to win the Yellow Ribbon Stakes for a second time. Ridden by Velaquez she started favorite ahead of the New Zealand-bred Black Mamba (winner of the John C. Mabee Handicap) and Vacare. After racing in third place on the outside, the mare took the lead entering the stretch, accelerated into a clear lead, and held off a challenge from Vacare to win by three-quarters of a length, with Black Mamba a length away in third. Velazquez reported that the mare \\"got a little bit aggressive with me when we started down the backside, but she does everything easy and I was able to bide my time. When we made the lead turning for home I thought she was going to just open up, but instead she waited on those horses. When Vacare came to her outside, though, she dug in and got it done.\\" Wait A While ended her career by contesting the tenth running of the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf run at Santa Anita on October 24 and started 4/1 second favorite behind the three-year-old Irish filly Halfway to Heaven. After racing in third place she moved forward on the outside on the final turn and briefly took the lead inside the final furlong but was overtaken in the final strides and finished third behind Forever Together and the Canadian outsider Sealy Hill. Following the race, Wait A While was disqualified from third place after testing positive for procaine, a local anaesthetic component of \\"procaine penicillin G\\" an antibiotic preparation which was administered to the mare to treat a fever she contracted after winning the Yellow Ribbon. Pletcher insisted that the drug had last been administered to the mare eighteen days before the Filly & Mare Turf after he had been assured that it would be clear of her system in fourteen days. Assessment and awards In the Eclipse Awards for 2006, Wait A While was named American Champion Three- Year-Old Filly.

It was designed and built by Andrew Petrie from 1849 to 1850. It is also known as Toogoolawah. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  left Bulimba House was erected in 1849-50 for early Queensland pastoralists David and Mary McConnel. David had established Cressbrook in the Brisbane Valley in 1841, the second run in the Moreton Bay district of New South Wales. In mid-1849 he purchased of land on the angle of the Brisbane River approximately five miles downstream from Brisbane Town. The subtropical rainforest area was known to the local Aborigines as Tugulawa or Toogoolawah, meaning \\"shape of heart\\". Here McConnel established an experimental farm, attempting to prove that cash- crop agriculture was a viable activity in Moreton Bay. Early crops included cotton, wheat, barley, maize, oats, lucerne, rye grass and yams. Whilst residing at Kangaroo Point in the second half of 1849, McConnel employed builder Andrew Petrie to construct the house at Toogoolawah, the first masonry Tudor-style homestead in the Brisbane region. The stone, as sandstone without directional grain, was quarried from the nearby Quarries Reach of the Brisbane River, and Moreton Bay cedar was employed in both the structure and the finishes. Cabinetmaker Robert Towell was engaged to craft most of the furniture on the spot, using local cedar and stained pine. McConnel and his wife Mary moved to Toogoolawah in December 1849, living in the detached service wing until the main house was completed. By 1852 they were using the Aboriginal name from the Whites Hill area which was already the official name for the whole parish‚ÄîBulimba, meaning place of the magpie lark or peewee. Situated on a rise in the centre of the property, Bulimba House overlooked the entire estate and boasted sweeping panoramic views from every window. It functioned as the centrepiece of a model manorial farm which, besides the cash cropping, operated self-sufficiently with a dairy herd, numerous livestock and poultry, kitchen garden and extensive orchard. By 1853 the farm comprised and included a variety of outbuildings: kitchen, laundry, store, stable, coachhouse, workrooms, dairies, barns and workers' cottages. In the early years eighty to one hundred men were employed on the estate, although some of these were probably seasonal, and various wives and daughters served in the house, kitchen, laundry and dairy. In manorial tradition, McConnel encouraged his workers to establish their own farms, selling them small portions of the Bulimba property for which they made regular repayments from their wages, and were given time off to clear and cultivate. Due to Mary McConnel's ill health the property was sold in February 1853 to pastoralist Donald Coutts for , and the McConnels returned temporarily to Britain. Most of the household furniture also was sold at this time. Coutts later subdivided the estate but remained in the house until his death in 1869. Since then the house has been owned or rented by a number of prominent Brisbanites including Arthur Edward Moore, Premier of Queensland from 1929 to 1932, who purchased Bulimba House in 1935. The property remains a family home on a much-reduced site of . Substantial additions to the rear of the house and some internal alterations were made during the 1970s by the owners at the time. The timber kitchen and service wing was demolished at this time. The current owners have undertaken extensive conservation work throughout the house and have refurbished the kitchen.  Description  Bulimba House, 2004 Bulimba House is a fine two-storeyed sandstone and brick residence which sits on the rise of gently sloping hill, and is set in a garden containing mature trees. The house in its setting makes a picturesque contribution to the Bulimba townscape. Bulimba House has a steeply pitched terracotta tiled gabled roof, with substantial chimneys rising above the roof line. The external form expresses a simple L-shaped plan; the front (north) elevation has two projecting gables to the western end, and a deep ground floor verandah with a terracotta tiled skillion roof to the eastern end. The back of the house (to the south) also has a deep ground floor verandah with a (now enclosed) verandah above. The exterior is modestly detailed, comprising tooled square-coursed sandstone to the north, west and eastern facades, and English bond brickwork south. The roof tiles () have small turtle emblems. The front elevation has single central casement windows to the gable ends, with a projecting bay window to the ground floor. The windows have curved pressed metal hoods with heart-shaped motifs (a later addition), and the bay window has smooth grey sandstone dressings. The gable ends have deep timber boarded eaves with terracotta finials. The verandah is supported on chamfered octagonal timber posts with rounded capitals, and has timber boarded spandrel panels with internally exposed bracing. The verandah ceiling is timber boarded. The south verandah also has chamfered octagonal timber posts and timber spandrels (now partly obscured by later alterations). The end elevations are more utilitarian, with only three openings to the west and a small room under the skillion roof surmounted by a gable end to the east. The brickwork to the back (south) elevation has up-struck mortar. The interior contains some fine detailing. It has cedar and hoop pine joinery throughout. The centrally located entrance hall has cedar stairs with a finely turned and carved balustrade. An ogee-shaped archway decorates the foot of the stairs. The Dining Room has a deep plaster cornice, and a fireplace with a finely carved mantelpiece, and tiled and cast iron surrounds. It also contains a bay window which sits in an arched recess. The bay window has sliding internal timber shutters which are encased in timber panels under the window sill. The Drawing Room has a cornice with a deep shadow line, a deep three- piece pine and cedar skirting, and a cast iron and tiled fireplace with a marble mantelpiece. It has timber louvred shutters and timber double doors set in deep timber reveals opening onto the verandahs. The upstairs rooms have raked ceilings, and contain fireplaces with timber and marble mantelpieces. The gardens contain a circular drive, a timber flagpole and several of the mature trees on the property, which include mangoes, camphor laurels and jacarandas.  Heritage listing  Bulimba House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Bulimba House is significant historically as the focus of one of Brisbane's earliest experimental riverine farms, and has an important association with the growth of Bulimba as a farming community in the 1850s. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. It is rare as an early surviving sandstone homestead in Brisbane, and evidences the skills of Brisbane's early Scottish carpenters and stonemasons. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The house is a fine, modestly-detailed building, containing some finely-detailed internal elements, and in its setting makes a picturesque contribution to the Bulimba townscape.

It was built from 1915 to 1955. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 November 1999.  History  Bulimba State School was first established in 1866 and contains several generations of buildings and structures that have been erected by the Department of Public Works to meet the growing needs of the community and are representative of some of the developments in education policy in Queensland since that time. Prior to the establishment of the Bulimba State School, classes were held initially at Bulimba House (the home of David McConnel) and then at the Baptist Church. In April 1866, a public meeting was held in the Bulimba Ferry Hotel with a view to raising funds for the construction of a National School. As the first settled agricultural district in the colony, the need for such a school had been felt for some time, but had been prevented by limited funds. Subscriptions of were made at the meeting and through submissions from the meeting and the subsequent actions of a building committee, an agreement was reached by the Government to establish the school. Michael Robinson's tender of for a school building and a residence was accepted in June 1866 and due for completion by the following October. In the interim, the school opened on 16 July 1866 in the Wesleyan Chapel. The first school building and residence were aligned and located at the top of the site in the south east corner facing south-west. As the district prospered and enrolments grew, extra classrooms were required and two additional timber wings were added to the school, which was raised at the turn of the century to allow for eight teaching rooms at ground level. Further additions were required within a decade and, in 1915, a separate infants building was erected facing Oxford Street. It was a highset timber framed building erected on timber stumps to provide toilets and a play space underneath the building. It was clad in weatherboards with an asbestos cement slate roof and was lined internally with tongue and groove v-jointed boards to the walls and coved ceiling. The hat rooms at each end of the verandah were unlined internally and the remainder of the verandah had vertical balustrading. Two flights of uncovered external timber stairs provided access to the verandah between which the teachers' room was attached. The building comprised three classrooms with southern lighting and ventilation provided by a large bank of windows comprising casements, centre pivoting sashes and hoppers at the top to provide a variety of ventilation options. This arrangement was repeated, at the eastern and western ends of the building, both of which were protected by sunshades. There were many representations made by the staff, the Parents and Citizen's Association, school committees, and local politicians during the late twenties and thirties to accommodate the ever-growing school population. In the early thirties, enrolments exceeded 520, of which over 150 were infants and it was resolved that the group of older timber classrooms should be replaced with a new building to accommodate 400, allowing the infants annexe, which was in good condition, to remain. The effects of the economic depression on building work in Queensland in the 1930s was dramatic and building work came to a standstill. The Queensland Government committed to providing impetus to the economy by embarking on capital works and relief works building programs from the early thirties until the late forties. The relief works program favoured works involving local manual labour. It was through this scheme that the Bulimba State School's site was levelled off and tennis and basketball courts were built in 1935, followed by the erection of retaining walls to two frontages and to the tennis court, which were completed in 1937 to drawings prepared by Gilbert Robert Beveridge. Beveridge prepared the plans for the new school building which was one of many substantial two and three storey schools built during this time, providing tangible proof of the Government's commitment to remedy the unemployment situation. The brick Bulimba State School building was completed in 1938 and cost . The building comprised two storeys and a basement constructed of brick and concrete with a tile roof. The Ground floor was to provide for six class rooms (240 pupils) two teacher's rooms and a clerk rooms. The first floor was to provide for seven classrooms (272 pupils), one teacher's room, and a cloak room a total accommodation of 512 pupils. The Basement contained play areas and lavatories for teachers and pupils and a complete drainage system was provided with septic tank. The next phase of major building activity occurred in the fifties. Around 1952, the Infant School must have suffered from some form of subsidence, as a program of works was initiated to include rectification work, general plumbing and straightening of the building and strengthening of the roof. Southern windows to the end classrooms were replaced with hoppers at this time and other general improvements were made. The swimming pool and dressing sheds were erected in 1955, in the location of a disused tennis court, with funds raised from parents and supporters during 1953-55 and subsidised by the Queensland Government. In 1957, a new two-storey classroom addition at the northern end of the building above the single storey female toilets provided the building with its present symmetrical form. Plans for future extensions to this building, with wings on the western face at the northern and southern ends, were not proceeded with and, in 1959, a highset timber framed building supported on an open web truss system on concrete stumps was erected. Kevin Rudd at the launch of the first volume of his autobiography in the school hall, 25 October 2017After peaking in the early sixties to in excess of 950 students, enrolments gradually declined to 242 in 1988. With the redevelopment of the area in the decade following, younger families have moved back into the area and at 2017 the school enrolments were 820. The school celebrated its 150th Anniversary by holding a Bulimba Heritage Weekend (22-23 July 2016) which included a gala dinner, DVD, and Commemorative book \\"Play the Game\\" published by Russell Turner, Jim Tunstall, and the Bulimba District Historical Society. On 25 October 2017 in the school's hall, former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd launched the first volume of his autobiography \\"Not for the faint-hearted : a personal reflection on life, politics and purpose\\" which chronicled his life until becoming prime minister in 2007. The school is within Rudd's former electorate of Griffith. In 2019, Michael Zeuschner, who had been the school's principal since 1995 moved to Mansfield State School as the new Acting Principal.  Description  Bulimba State School, 1946 Bulimba State School is located on a site and is bound by Oxford Street to the north, Wentworth parade to the East, Riding Road to the West and by Barton Parade and freehold property to the South. It is a steeply sloping west facing site with levelled areas occupied by school buildings and parade and play areas at the top of the site. Pathways west of Block B and south of Block C wind down the steep embankment to the netball courts, cricket facilities and bottom oval on more level ground at the Riding Road and Barton Parade boundaries to the site. The school buildings and structures comprise Block A, B, C and D (a demountable classroom), a new administration and resource centre and a timber framed classroom block under construction. Concrete walls retain both Wentworth Parade and Oxford Street (from the corner to the swimming pool) boundaries. A tennis court is located on the north-eastern corner, several metres above street level. Between the tennis court and the swimming pool, the demountable building -Block D, a shelter shed and the adventure playground are located. Block A and B form the eastern and northern boundaries to the parade area, part of which is now occupied by the new outdoor learning area and verandahs of the new resource and administration building. A new classroom building is located to the west of Block B. The in ground concrete swimming pool has covered seating and changing rooms enclosing it to the north, east and west. Block C, the former infant school and now used as the Preschool, is located to the west of the swimming pool and faces Oxford Street. Block A is a symmetrical two storey load bearing brick building with basement and hipped terracotta tiled roof. The primary and secondary entrances to the building are expressed by a projected pedimented gable wing to the west and a pair of breakfronts to the east. A prominent fleche is centrally located. The treatment of the elevations creates a basement level distinct from the two floors of the school proper above. The load bearing brick work to the basement is rendered and ruled to form a plinth upon which bays of stretcher bond red brickwork are relieved with pilasters of contrasting Flemish bond dark glazed brickwork shafts with cement rendered bases and capitals of restrained detail. The horizontal banding of the frieze to the pedimented gable and breakfronts continues below the eaves around the perimeter of the building. The main entry is expressed by a pedimented doorway and the symmetry reinforced by two straight flight of stairs with half landing from the north and south. At basement level, a play space occupies the area between the north and south stairwells with boys' lavatories at the southern end of the building and girls lavatories to the north. Separate facilities were provided for infants, older children and teachers and have now been altered to include a parents' room and storage areas. Seats to curtain walls, drinking taps and troughs, and store areas under main entry stair are also located in the basement which has a low floor to floor height compared to the floors above. Detailing in the play area includes bullnose brickwork on freestanding and engaged piers, eliminating right angle corners to reduce injury. The classrooms have timber floors supported on a series of articulated steel beams expressed in the ceiling detailing and stairwells; corridors and utility areas have suspended concrete floors. Downpipes are located within the walls. Four four-light casement windows with fanlights above provide ventilation to the corridor and into the classroom through double hung windows On the ground floor, the main entry hall separates the office and head teacher's rooms. The hall leads to the centre of a north-south corridor which provides access to five classrooms between the north and south stair halls. The central three classrooms are divided by folding partition doors. A cloak room and cleaner's sink are provided at the eastern end of each stairwell. Another classroom and cloak room is located in the end bay at the southern end of the building. A similar layout exists on the first floor. Block B is a high set timber framed building supported on steel open web joists with a cantilevered portion supporting the verandah. Stairs at the eastern and western ends provide access to a narrow verandah on the northern side of the building which contains a continuous hat and bag rack and provides access to the three classrooms. This building is of a type of which there are numerous examples, several of which are more comparatively intact and which represent a more extensive use of this type of structure. Block C is a high set timber framed structure on concrete stumps. Three classrooms have been made into two and folding partitions have been removed as well as large sections of walls to the verandahs. The verandahs have been enclosed and stairs have been altered. The roof sheeting has been more recently replaced with corrugated iron and the roof fleche removed. Ceilings are coved and lined with tongue and groove V jointed boards verandahs enclosed stair altered, windows altered etc. This building is also of a type where there are many more intact and representative examples throughout Queensland. Biscoe Wilson Architects later oversaw the construction of the new 10 General Learning Areas (GLA) and Library along Oxford Street.  Heritage listing  Bulimba State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 November 1999, having satisfied the following criteria: The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. At Bulimba State School, established in 1866, the variety of building types and structures from different periods are representative of some of the many developments in education policy in Queensland and demonstrate the evolution of the school and the community. The brick Bulimba State School building and the concrete retaining walls and associated fences and gates constructed in 1937-1938 are significant as a tangible demonstration of the Queensland Government's commitment to providing impetus to an economy and building industry reeling from the effects of the 1930s depression. The retaining walls, fences, gates and courts also have special significance for the local community as the work relief scheme employed local workers. The main building, Block A, erected in 1937-38 is significant as a substantial interwar building which reflects the growth and stability of the population of Bulimba. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Bulimba State School demonstrates the principle characteristics of a primary school precinct with a hierarchy of structures and open spaces built over several generations for educational purposes by the Department of Education. The school's structures and grounds provide a series of formal and informal spaces including open playground spaces, a formal parade ground, pathways, sports areas, swimming pool and tennis court facilities as well as undercroft and verandah areas. It is an excellent and intact urban example of a substantial interwar building and displays the particular characteristics of this school building type. The use of brick and restrained detailing is typical for government buildings of the period, and Bulimba State School principal building follows in the tradition of fine buildings erected by the Queensland Public Works Department. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It is a fine example of a school building designed by the office of the Queensland Government Architect and has aesthetic significance brought about by its massing and restrained classical detailing. Bulimba State School and grounds is also significant for the landmark value of its principal building and setting which provides a reference point in the community. The imposing massing and scale of the brick building looms high atop Carlton Hill above surrounding suburban development with commanding views afforded both to and from the site to Moreton Bay, Hamilton and New Farm. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Bulimba State School is valued by its community for the essential community function it provides and as a link between the past and present through its long traditional connection with the area. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Bulimba State School principal building follows in the tradition of fine buildings erected by the Queensland Public Works Department.

There were two versions: the short-wheelbase DE 27 with the Daimler Twenty-seven six cylinder engine, and the long-wheelbase DE 36, the last Daimler Straight-Eight, with the Thirty-six straight-eight engine. Daimler DEs, especially the DE 36 Straight-Eight, was sold to royalty and heads of state around the world, including British royalty under the royal warrant that Daimler had held since 1900. The DE chassis was also the basis for the DC ambulance chassis on which coachbuilders Barker and Hooper built five hundred units of the Daimler DC 27 Ambulance. A variant of the DC chassis became the DH chassis, on which fifty DH 27 limousines were built for Daimler Hire. Features of the DE chassis The DE chassis was designed by Daimler chief engineer C. M. Simpson.The Post-War 27 h.p. Daimler, p.17 It was based on a separate steel frame, which was the conventional practice at the time. This allowed customers to order a rolling chassis and have a body custom-built to their own specifications by a coachbuilder. The side rails of the frame were reinforced by x-braced crossmembers. The rear wheels were driven through a Hotchkiss drive system modified with control arms linking the rear axle casing to pivot points on the frame located directly above the true pivot of the leaf springs. These arms controlled the lateral movement of the rear axle without distorting the normal action of the springs, and allowed freedom in the vertical and longitudinal directions. Final drive was by hypoid gears, replacing the worm drive that had been used on final drives in Daimler cars since 1910. The rear track was wide. Tyres were 8.00 x 17 all around. Based on the design used with the DB 18 chassis, the front wheels were suspended independently of each other by pairs of control arms, of which the lower arms were of the wide-based wishbone type and were supported by coil springs mounted to the frame.The Post-War 27 h.p. Daimler, p.21 The upper arm was shorter than the lower and operated Luvax-Girling dampers. The track rods were pivoted to swing at the same radius as the suspension links. The front dampers were connected to each other by an anti-roll bar. The front track was wide. The steering used Marles roller gear but, instead of the kingpin being inclined to create castor angle as was conventional, the hub centre was placed behind the kingpin centres. This was done to improve the controllability of the car. Braking was by Girling hydro-mechanical brakes, with hydraulic brakes at the front wheels and mechanical brakes at the rear wheels.The Post-War 27 h.p. Daimler, p.20 These were assisted by a Clayton-Dewandre servo motorThe Post-War 27 h.p. Daimler, pp.20‚Äì21 The bodywork available through Daimler included electrically operated windows and central divider, interior lights that were switched on when a door or the boot lid was opened, and warning lights on the rear wings that were on while the boot was open. DE 27 Windover six-light limousine The DE 27 was positioned between the DB 18 and the DE 36 Straight-Eight. It used the Twenty-seven engine and the short- wheelbase DE chassis. Production ended in 1951. =Twenty-seven engine= The Twenty-seven straight-six engine was developed for use in the Daimler Armoured Car and was later used in the DE 27, the DC 27 ambulance, and the DH 27 hire limousine. The engine had its cylinders cast together with the upper crankcase and featured a four-bearing crankshaft with counterbalancing weights. The big end bearings were flanged over the sides of the crankshaft to locate the rods against the crank webs, which reduced engine noise. =Other DE 27 specifications= The DE 27 chassis weighed and had a wheelbase of . Its fluid capacities were for petrol, for oil, and for coolant. DE 36 all-weather tourer The DE 36 was the last Daimler Straight-Eight and the last British motor car with a straight-eight engine to be made available to the public.Examples of the straight-eight powered Rolls-Royce Phantom IV were built after the DE 36 ended production in 1953, but the Phantom IV was available only to royalty and heads of state. It was offered in saloon, limousine and drophead coupe body styles.Michael Sedgwick & Mark Gillies, A-Z of Cars 1945-1970, page 48 In addition to British royalty, Daimler sold DE 36s to the royalty of Afghanistan, Ethiopia, the Netherlands, Monaco, Saudi Arabia, and Thailand. 205 DE 36 chassis were built. Production ended in 1953. =Show cars= 1952 Daimler \\"Blue Clover\\" show car Daimler and its coachbuilding subsidiary, Hooper, built three show cars on DE 36 chassis for display at the annual Earls Court Motor Show: the \\"Green Goddess\\", a 5-seat drophead coup√© with a hydraulically operated hood, in 1947; the \\"Golden Daimler\\", a touring limousine with gold foil trim and 7,000 gold stars applied to the sides of the body, in 1951; and the \\"Blue Clover\\", a 5-seat fixed-head coup√©, in 1952. =DE 36 specifications= The DE 36 used the Thirty-six straight-eight engine and had a wheelbase of . DC 27 ambulance Barker- bodied DC 27 ambulance in the livery of the Surrey Ambulance Service After the Second World War, the London County Council commissioned a prototype ambulance and made enquiries to the motor industry for a similar vehicle. The Daimler Company offered to build an ambulance with nearly all the features of the prototype, including the essential requirements specified by an advisory committee to the Ministry of Health. Daimler designed and developed the DC 27 chassis specifically for this purpose. The DC 27 was the first purpose-built ambulance available in Britain after the Second World War. The DC 27 was noted for its low floor level, which eased the work for stretcher crews, and for the large amount of space inside the working area. The working area had air conditioning and heating. Advantages of the DC 27 included a high interior with good headroom, a smooth ride, and stable handling. Disadvantages included the lack of access to the cab from the working area, fuel consumption of approximately , and an inadequate braking system. The London County Council placed an initial order of 120 DC 27 and standardised the type, eventually buying more than 200 overall. Other areas that used the type included Bath, Belfast, Birmingham, Carmarthenshire, Croydon, Cumberland, Hertfordshire, Isle of Wight, Nottingham, Plymouth, Salford, and Surrey. London decommissioned its last Daimler ambulance in 1964. Slow sales, a result of its high price, led Daimler to discontinue the DC 27 after building five hundred chassis. =DC 27 specifications= Chassis numbers for the DC 27 ambulance went from 54000 to 54499. The bodies were first built by Barker & Co.; some later bodies were built by Hooper & Co.. The most visible difference between Barker and Hooper bodies is with the lines along the side of the body: Barker bodies have two lines while Hooper bodies have one. The body was based on an ash frame. The DC 27 used the Twenty-seven engine with a modified distributor and a single Solex carburettor in place of the DE 27's twin SUs. In this tune, the engine delivered at 3,600 rpm, which gave a maximum speed of .The Motor, Volume 97, p.24 Typical of Daimler vehicles of the time, the transmission was a four- speed Wilson-type pre-selector gearbox with a fluid flywheel. Like the DE chassis on which it was based, the DC 27 had hypoid gear drive, independent front suspension, and hydro-mechanical brakes. The engine was positioned at a slight angle from longitudinal and the final drive and differential were offset toward the left. The DC 27 had a wheelbase of . DH 27 limousine A batch of fifty DH 27 limousines were built for Daimler Hire, with bodies built by Hooper. The DH 27 seated up to seven passengers and was equipped with air conditioning, a heater, and an electrically-operated partition between the passengers and the driver.The Motor, Volume 100, p. 483 A DH 27, chassis number D 52948, which had been decommissioned by Daimler Hire and bought by Vickers-Armstrongs, was bought from Vickers by Thomas Corbett, 2nd Baron Rowallan in 1961 for use as his official state car as Governor of Tasmania.John Hiscox's DH 27 =DH 27 specifications= The DH 27 chassis, numbered from D 52900 to D 52949, were based on the DC 27 Ambulance chassis and had the same wheelbase, which was three inches longer than that of the DE 36 Straight-Eight. The track was at the front and at the rear.

He taught painting for almost 70 years. Early life and education Loper was born to a poor family on the east side of Wilmington, Delaware, in a racially mixed section known as Frogtown.Maria Hess, ‚ÄúThe Secret Life of Color,‚Äù Delaware Today, February 2007. At the time of his birth, his mother was 16. Loper was raised primarily by his maternal grandmother. Growing up, he did not receive formal artistic training.The Art of Edward L. Loper, Sr.: On the Path of the Masters , Newark, DE: University Museums of the University of Delaware, 2007, p. 1. He attended Howard High School, where he was an All-State football and basketball player.‚ÄúRemembering Edward L. Loper, Sr.,‚Äù Congressional Record, volume 157, number 165, November 1, 2011, p. S7001. At the time, this was the only high school in Delaware that African Americans were allowed to attend. After graduating from high school in 1934, he had to forego an athletic scholarship at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania to start working in order to help his family financially.Mary Ann Meyers, Art, Education, and African-American Culture, New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2004, p. 307. Career My Father The Bishop Oil on canvas, 48\\" x 36\\", 1975 University of Delaware =Artist beginnings= In 1936, during the Great Depression, Loper started working in Delaware for the Works Progress Administration (WPA), rendering drawings of decorative art for the Index of American Design, a large archive of folk art images based in Washington, DC.Bob Eisler, ‚ÄúPortrait Of An Artist,‚Äù The Sunday Star, January 27, 1952. The job required him to illustrate images of objects in American design such as toys and furniture. He produced 113 of them in total. He later credited the job with giving him his start as an artist. Three of his renderings (a Windsor chair, a toy bank and a cast-iron fire screen) were later included in the Index of Modern Design's 2002 exhibition, Drawing on America's Past: Folk Art, Modernism and the Index of American Design.Linda Hales, ‚ÄúPainted From Hard Life,‚Äù Washington Post, December 2, 2002. The index is currently housed at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC.The Art of Edward L. Loper, Sr.: On the Path of the Masters, p. 2. Loper was encouraged to paint by his WPA co- worker Walter Pyle, the nephew of illustrator and author Howard Pyle. Loper began studying Howard Pyle's work at the Wilmington Public Library. He began taking the train to the Philadelphia Museum of Art on weekends, studying painting's great masters; self-taught, he slowly developed his own style and technique. He was employed by the Works Progress Administration Art Project from 1936‚Äì41, and at the Allied Kid leather tanning factory until 1947, at which point he became a full-time artist and teacher.Edward Loper: African American Painter, Hagley Museum and Library. Accessed December 6, 2014. =Painting= In 1937, Loper became the first African American to have a painting accepted by the Wilmington Society of the Fine Arts (now the Delaware Art Museum). His painting After a Shower, a depiction of Wilmington on a stormy night, won honorable mention at a 1938 exhibition of the Wilmington Society of the Fine Arts, and was later purchased by the society for its permanent collection.Delaware: A Guide to the First State, p. 55, 1938.Nancy Capace, Encyclopedia of Delaware, Somerset Publishers, p. 53, 2000. He was profiled in Howard University professor Alain Locke's landmark 1940 book The Negro in Art.The Art of Edward L. Loper, Sr.: On the Path of the Masters, p. 4. In 1941, he exhibited a painting at the University of Delaware. At the time, African Americans were not allowed to attend the university. In the 1940s, Loper painted mostly landscapes and cityscapes of his neighborhood in Wilmington, in vivid colors. By the early 1950s, with a growing appreciation of the works of Pablo Picasso, Loper had transitioned from creating self- described mood paintings to concentrating on color and shapes, including experimenting with a kind of kaleidoscopic cubism, refracting subjects into planes as if seen through shards of glass.The Art of Edward L. Loper, Sr.: On the Path of the Masters, pp. 5-9. Loper's artistic direction was solidified in 1963, after he was invited to attend classes at the Barnes Foundation in Merion, Pennsylvania, established by Albert C. Barnes in 1922 and home to one of the world's largest private art collections. He was first invited to study there when he met Barnes in 1946, but declined the original offer, as he was recently married with young children to care for. He was taught by Violette de Mazia to carefully analyze classical techniques at the Barnes Foundation from 1963 to 1968. When he saw Paul C√©zanne's The Boy in the Red Vest, it changed the way he thought about color, having a major effect on the use and juxtaposition of color in his work. He was heavily influenced by his study of the art at the Barnes Foundation. Loper's work of the 1960s and beyond became more dramatically structured, colorful and refracted than his earlier work. The Delaware Art Museum organized Loper's first retrospective in 1996, Edward L. Loper: From the Prism's Edge, covering 60 years of his work. In 2007, the University of Delaware presented The Art of Edward Loper, Sr.: On the Path of the Masters, a comprehensive retrospective. =Teaching= 34 St. Pierre, Quebec Oil on canvas, 36\\" x 30\\", 1980 Private collection, Austin, TX Loper started teaching painting in 1940.The Art of Edward L.

Starting in the late 1940s, to escape some of the racism he experienced at home, he began traveling to Quebec City in Canada, where he would paint boldly-colored cityscapes. He began taking his students there every summer starting in the 1960s.The Art of Edward L. Loper, Sr.: On the Path of the Masters, p. 10. Over the years he would teach at the Allied Kid Company, Delaware Art Museum, Delaware College of Art and Design, Lincoln University, Jewish Community Center in Wilmington, and finally, classes at his studio.‚ÄúHagley Film on African American Painter Edward Loper, Sr., now Available Online!‚Äù hagley.org, February 1, 2013. As a teacher, Loper was known for his charismatic, intense and demanding demeanor.

On November 1, 2011, Delaware senators Thomas R. Carper and Christopher A. Coons memorialized Loper as part of the Congressional Record. Carper stated that Loper's \\"talent for color broke the mold of his time, and his passion for teaching others to see through color was unsurpassed,\\" adding that he \\"changed the landscape for black artists and paved the way for others who came after him.\\" The University of Delaware inherited all of Loper's work in his possession at the time of his death.

Epstein (born March 15, 1937) is an American politician who served in the New Jersey Senate as a Republican from 1972-74 and later went to federal prison for pirating millions of dollars worth of fuel oil. Born in New Brunswick, Epstein attended the Wardlaw-Hartridge School and graduated from Rutgers University in 1958. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps. He was an executive with his family's fuel oil and gasoline distribution company. He was the Chairman of the Union County Health Board, and was a Legislative Aide to State Senator Nelson Stamler.Fitzgerald, Thoms F.

In 1971, he was elected to the State Senate. He ran with two incumbent GOP Senators, Matthew John Rinaldo and Frank X. McDermott for the open seat of Nicholas LaCorte (R-Union), who had resigned to become a Judge. Epstein defeated Carmine J. Liotta of Elizabeth, an attorney for the New Jersey Office of Consumer Protection, by just 400 votes, 68,531 to 68,131. In 1972, Epstein wanted Leslie Glick, an ex-Assistant Union County Prosecutor, to get a Superior Court Judgeship, but Governor William Cahill instead nominated Stephen Bercik, a former Mayor of Elizabeth. Epstein escalated his feud with Cahill by using Senatorial Courtesy to block the reappointment of former New York Stock Exchange Chairman James C. Kellogg III for reappointment as a Commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Feuds with Cahill and with local Republican leaders in Union County caused Epstein to lose party support in his bid for re-election to a second term in 1973. He lost the Republican primary to Assemblyman Peter McDonough, 7,214 (60.37%) to 4,735 (39.63%).

He was also among the leading members of the Reformist Bloc. Career Born in Sofia, Moskov is a graduate of the Medical University in the capital city, specializing in anesthesiology and intensive care. In 2004, Moskov was one of the founding members of the DSB. In 2013, he was elected as the vice-chairman of the party. On 7 November 2014, Moskov assumed his duties as Minister of Health of Bulgaria, succeeding Miroslav Nenkov. On 19 September 2016, the arbitrage board of DSB voted to remove Moskov from the party due to what they deemed to be his increasingly radical views, his refusal to resign from his position as minister after the party left the ruling coaliton and nonpayment of party membership dues. Moskov reacted by accusing them of \\"returning to 1917\\" and postulated that his former party might destire to \\"intern himself and his family\\" in a prison.  Political Party project  In March 2019, Moskov announced that he would be forming a right-wing religious conservative political party dubbed the Conservative Rightist Unity (KOD), after separating from the Reformist Bloc as he thought it was not right-wing enough. His former coalition partners denounced both him and KOD, dubbing the party a project of \\"anti-European authoritarian conservatism\\". The party was strongly conservative and right wing, viewing liberalism and socialism as its two greatest rivals. It declared its opposition to centrism and \\"popular\\" parties and instead sought to instead impose conservatism as the dominant social force, deeming it to support \\"rules and values that return normality\\". Consequently, he declared a principled opposition to all remaining Bulgarian political parties with the exception of IMRO ‚Äì Bulgarian National Movement and the National Front for the Salvation of Bulgaria. Moskov has declared that the previous right-wing governments' policies were akin to \\"a grandmother and grandfather watching porn together to see if they get married\\". He has cited the Trump Administration and Viktor Orb√°n's Hungary as examples of the type of right-wing conservatism his would seek to impose. It declared its wish to impose a conservative ideology on Bulgaria in order to oppose what he dubbed the \\"obviously failed\\" principles of liberalism, socialism and green politics. He also sought to disfranchise former communists and BZNS members trough a process of \\"criminal lustration\\", as well as those with lower education qualifications by one of his proposals to ban people that have not attained a certain level of academic education from voting in elections or referendums. The party failed to register according to Bulgarian election law and declared that it was not ready to take part in the 2019 European Parliament election in Bulgaria. Meanwhile, both it and its former coalition partners all failed to obtain any seats in the country's parliamentary elections. The party again failed to register for the 2019 Bulgarian local elections and as such did not appear on the ballot at all.  Controversy  = Refusal to send paramedics to minority neighbourhoods = In December of 2014, Moskov declared that the ministry of Healthcare would refuse to send ambulances or medical personnel to neighbourhoods inhabited primarily by Bulgaria's Roma minority after stating that there were incidents of assaults on ambulances in those neighbourhoods. Due to his declaration, he faced public backlash and was accused of discrimination against the minority group. = Vaccine scandals = While serving as Minister for Health, he was embroiled in a scandal concerning the procurement of vaccines from Turkey. He was subsequently brought to criminal trial, accused of non-fulfilment of his duties trough his acceptance of the delivery of non-authorized vaccines for use in the Bulgaria. The accusation against him stated that his actions allegedly significantly undermined the Ministry of Health's credibility and raised anti-vaccination sentiments in the country. He was also separately indicted of allegedly aiding in the creation of a bad government contract in which Bulgaria gave away 5,000,000 vaccine doses to a company for free.

It was built in 1889. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Eulalia is a single- storeyed brick house which was constructed in 1889. The land on which the house stands was first bought by August Dimper who purchased in 1860. In 1888, the land was further subdivided and was purchased by Patrick Real. In the following year Real employed Brisbane architects, John Hall & Sons to design a house for the site and Morley Whitehead of Ipswich were subsequently contracted to build Eulalia, a Greek word meaning speaking well of everybody. At this period, John Smith Murdoch was employed in the office of John Hall and Sons and it is possible that he may have been the designer for Eulalia. Patrick Real was the son of impoverished Irish emigrants and left school at twelve to become an apprentice carpenter and later to work at the North Ipswich Railway Workshops. After deciding on a legal career, he studied law and was admitted to the bar at the age of twenty-seven. By the time he built Eulalia in 1889, his practice was one of the largest in Queensland. Real was appointed to the Supreme Court of Queensland bench in 1890 and in 1903 he became Senior Puisne Judge. He retired in 1922 and died in 1928. After Real's death, the house was closed and left vacant for a decade during which time it fell victim to vandals and the weather, becoming known locally as the haunted house. Most of the land had been subdivided and sold by 1925 leaving a property of about surrounding the house. In 1938 Eulalia was bought by Stanley and Sheilah Hancock who restored the property, discovering many items in the gardens where they had been discarded by vandals, and re-instating them in the house. The Hancock family first arrived in Queensland when they moved from Sydney to Ipswich in the late 1850s. The family established a successful timber milling business which involved five generations of the Hancock family and continued until the late 1970s. Stanley Hancock was president of the National Trust of Queensland from 1974 to 1978. This was a period when a number of National Trust of Queensland properties were established including Bellevue Homestead, Claremont and Brennan & Geraghtys Store. Whilst Eulalia was a family home for the Hancocks, they also used it as a venue for fundraising functions for a number of Brisbane charities. This \\"public\\" use of Eulalia was further expanded in 1965, when the Hancocks established Early Street Historical Village in the grounds of Eulalia. The establishment of the Village is the earliest known example of the Queensland practice of creating \\"historical villages\\" by moving various buildings to one central site. It is therefore demonstrative of the development of conservation practice and theory in Queensland. Early Street Historical Village closed in 1998 having reached \\"the end of its life in terms of public appreciation\\". The other buildings on the site were auctioned off; most were relocated to outer suburban sites for use as housing.  Description  Pedestrian entrance and gardens, 2015 Built on a prominent hill with expansive views, Eulalia is a single-storeyed house with two rear wings, rendered brick walls and a hipped slate roof. The entire block on which Eulalia and the adjacent Early Street Historical Village are located is planted with mature gums, palm trees, bunya pines, jacarandas and bougainvillea and many other species, making it a dominant landmark in an otherwise typical suburban setting and one of the few surviving examples of mature planting in the area. These plantings are also instrumental in conveying an impression of the original semi-rural setting of Eulalia. Associated structures on the site include a tank stand and a substantially modified coach house. The house faces north and comprises a pedimented entrance porch leading onto a wide verandah, flanked by two projecting bays. The verandah continues around three sides of the house, featuring a cast iron balustrade separated by tapered octagonal timber posts with decorative capitals and fretwork brackets. The principal timber is beech. Tessellated floor tiles continue from the slate steps at the porch through the entry and into the wide hallway. The main door is panelled, with leaded glass sidelights and an etched fanlight featuring gum leaves, a swallow and a dragonfly. A similarly lit doorway is located at the opposite end of the hall. On the right of the hallway are separate drawing and dining rooms, the former incorporating a window bay with Doric fluted columns and pilasters on either side, and the latter a set of cedar folding doors which can be folded back to create one large area incorporating the hallway. On the left of the hall are the master bed, dressing and sitting rooms. Joinery throughout the house is of cedar, including architraves and pedimented overdoors which reach almost to the plaster cornice of sixteen feet high ceilings. The ornate drawing room mantelpiece is of a mahogany, whilst others are of oak. The long sash windows which open from the main rooms onto the verandah feature hinged dog-doors at floor level. At the end of the hall, the house divides into two wings, one dowel-balustraded verandah on the left leading to the bathroom and two bedrooms, and the other on the right to the former study and service rooms including a kitchen, pantry, maid's room and laundry. A large cellar is located beneath this wing.  Heritage listing  Eulalia was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Constructed in 1889, Eulalia and its grounds are important for the evidence they provide of the way of life of prosperous citizens in the outer reaches of Brisbane in the late nineteenth century. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The house is important as an example of a fine quality 1880s Queensland residence of masonry construction that is substantially intact, both externally and internally. It is also an uncommon example of a 19th-century residence still located in substantial grounds which separate it from the surrounding suburban development. The grounds and gardens, which contain mature plantings including gums, palm trees, bunya pines, jacarandas and bougainvillea contribute to the overall integrity of the place. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It has several rare and highly decorative architectural features, including the verandahs surrounding the bay windows and their finely detailed verandah posts and brackets. These features, combined with the fine quality of interior finishes and fittings, including cedar joinery, internal pilasters and columns, and flooring of tessellated tiles give Eulalia considerable aesthetic significance. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Its prominent location and mature plantings ensure that the entire site is a significant landmark in the area. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Eulalia is significant for its association with its first owner, the Hon. Patrick Real Senior who was a prominent Brisbane lawyer and Puisne Judge in the early 1890s and is perpetuated in the surrounding streets, including Judge, Patrick and Real Streets. Katherine Street is named after a family member. It is also significant for its association with its second owner, Stanley Hancock who was President of the National Trust of Queensland from 1974 to 1978, and was influential in the early conservation of Queensland's heritage. Eulalia also has strong association with the adjacent Early Street Historical Village, established in 1965 in conjunction with the house by the Hancocks as the first known heritage property in Queensland to be promoted as a tourist and educational attraction.

It was the first commercial brewery to open in Hackney since the 19th century. As of December 2014, the company fell into trouble following the arrest of co-founder Julian de Vere Whiteway-Wilkinson, on suspicion of tax evasion. In 2017, London Fields Brewery was purchased in a joint-venture by Brooklyn Brewery and Carlsberg UK with plans to bring brewing back onsite. History The brewery opened on 27 August 2011, at 374 Helmsley Place. It was the first commercial brewery to open in Hackney since the 19th century. Five beers were produced, named: Hackney Hopster, London Fields Bitter, London Fields Session Ale, London Fields Gold and Love Not War. Love Not War received especially favourable press due to its significance in relation to the London riots. It was promoted as \\"first brewed barricaded in the brewery during the London riots\\". Alongside a wide and highly successful distribution of its products throughout London, the brewery itself worked alongside numerous entertainment companies and helped produce events in London. These included Background Cinema, Elsewhere Festival, and Festifeel. The brewery was founded by Julian de Vere Whiteway- Wilkinson and Ian Burges, around the time of the 2011 London riots, with approximately ¬£10,000 of capital. Prior to founding the brewery, Whiteway had been jailed for 12 years for his part in a cocaine smuggling organisations. When founding the company, Whiteway still owed The Crown ¬£3.2 million, including ¬£1.2 million in interest. Despite much legal manoeuvring, this would continue to heavily impact the ability of the company to operate. The court granted Whiteway permission to create the company as a way to repay the courts whilst rehabilitating into a legitimate career, however, he was ordered to pay back ¬£500 a month throughout this time. Whiteway's lawyer argued that a stay in repayments would allow his client to grow his capital more quickly, and asked the court to allow the company to fulfil export orders to 14 countries. As of December 2014, neither of these requests had been granted. Most recently, on 3 December 2014, Whiteway was arrested on suspicion of cheating HMRC in respect of VAT. On the same day, the brewery was searched, and a forklift truck was used by HMRC to remove equipment and stock. According to Whiteway, by 2014, both he and his wife were joint shareholders in the company, but presiding District Judge Elizabeth Roscoe was not convinced of this, asking to see evidence of \\"ownership and set-up\\", as promises of future payment \\"were often not fulfilled\\".

He is best known for serving as special White House Counsel to Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal. Previously he had served as General Counsel of the Department of Defense and as a legislative aide to Senator Strom Thurmond.  Early life  Buzhardt was born in Greenwood, South Carolina, to Joseph Fred Buzhardt Sr., and Edna Hardin Buzhardt. The family later moved to McCormick, South Carolina, and Buzhardt graduated from McCormick High School with honors. Early career Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird in 1973. He first attended Wofford College from 1941 to 1943 before he was appointed to the US Military Academy. He graduated from West Point in 1946 and then served in the US Air Force. Following his military service, he attended the University of South Carolina and earned a law degree in 1952. He then returned to McCormick and entered private practice, alongside his father. Buzhardt left private practice in 1958 to become a legislative assistant to Senator Strom Thurmond. During the 1964 presidential campaign, Buzhardt, along with William J. Baroody Jr. and Anthony J. Jurich, advised the Republican National Committee on military affairs. Buzhardt succeeded Harry S. Dent Sr., as Thurmond's administrative assistant in 1965. Buzhardt left Thurmond's staff in 1966, but the two remained close. In 1968 Dent and Buzhardt attempted to talk Thurmond out of his proposed marriage to Nancy Moore, a former beauty queen and 44 years his junior. Their efforts were unsuccessful and apparently did not affect either man's relationship with Thurmond. Buzhardt was one of only 35 people, 26 of whom were family, in attendance at Thurmond's wedding to Moore in December 1968. According to Dent, Buzhardt was \\"like a son\\" to Thurmond, who had practiced law with Buzhardt's father. Buzhardt stayed active in Republican party politics in South Carolina, serving as Marshall Parker's campaign manager for the latter's unsuccessful bid for US senator in 1968. That year, Buzhardt was named as an alternate delegate to the Republic National Convention, which would nominate Richard Nixon for the presidency. After the Republican victory in November, incoming Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird tapped Buzhardt for his staff.  Watergate  White House Chief of Staff General Alexander Haig sought Buzhardt's help with John Dean's allegations. Buzhardt was named as special White House counsel for Watergate matters on May 10, 1973. Alexander Haig, President Nixon's new White House Chief of Staff following the resignation of H. R. Haldeman, told Buzhardt that his role at the White House would be temporary, and so he retained his title at the Defense Department. His first task as special counsel was to investigate former White House Counsel John Dean. Dean, whom the president had fired the previous week, was cooperating with investigators and was believed to possess classified documents. Buzhardt, through his contacts in the intelligence community, determined that the documents were related to the Huston Plan, an illegal proposed expansion of domestic surveillance. It was Buzhardt who inadvertently tipped off Senate Watergate Committee investigators about the existence of the White House tapes. Nixon and Haig, who were aware of the sound-activated taping system in the Oval Office, had given to Buzhardt, who was not aware of it, detailed accounts of Nixon's meetings with Dean, including verbatim quotes. Buzhardt, in turn, conveyed the material to Fred Thompson, then minority counsel to the Watergate Committee. As recounted by Scott Armstrong, the majority staff discovered the transcript and questioned former White House aide Alexander Butterfield about its provenance. The questions led directly to Butterfield's July 16, 1973 disclosure of the taping system to the committee and then the public. Thompson, informed of the disclosure, in turn, warned Buzhardt, who then learned of it, for the first time, in that indirect way. Buzhardt would spend hundreds of hours listening to the tapes to determine their contents before the tapes were conveyed to investigators. After Butterfield's revelation of the taping system, Buzhardt was active in resisting efforts by the Watergate Special prosecutor to obtain them. That November, after Nixon agreed to surrender some tapes, it became Buzhardt's task to inform U.S. District Judge John Sirica, who had issued the subpoenas for the tapes, that one of them contained an 18 1/2 minute erased gap. The tape in question contained a conversation between the president and H. R. Haldeman from June 20, 1972, just a few days after the Watergate break-in. Additionally, Buzhardt was involved in the negotiations that led to Vice President Spiro Agnew's resignation after being accused of accepting illegal payments. Judah Best, Agnew's attorney, recalled later that Buzhardt threatened to \\"personally... strap on his old '.45' and 'take care' of the situation\\" if anyone leaked the negotiations to the press. The negotiations did not leak, and Agnew resigned on October 10, 1973.  Later life  In a widely reported interview published in 1975, Buzhardt inquired whether the public would prefer \\"a competent scoundrel or an honest boob\\" as president, and he lamented that invasive media coverage inhibited good governance. Although Buzhardt denied it, Washington Post columnist David S. Broder interpreted the remark as a thinly-veiled attack on Gerald Ford, Nixon's successor. Buzhardt died of a heart attack at Hilton Head, South Carolina.  Legacy  Buzhardt co-operated with Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein during the research for a book, which became The Final Days, by sitting for eight \\"extensive\\" interviews. In the 1989 film adaptation of the book, Richard Kiley portrayed Buzhardt. Kiley called Buzhardt \\"one of the mystery men, very much behind the scenes, and yet he played a key role.\\" Leonard Garment, his former colleague in the Nixon White House, recalled Buzhardt as \\"one of the most profoundly moral men I have known.\\" Buzhardt's papers are at Clemson University.

The first attempt on 26 November 2014 rescued 8 hostages, but five hostages, including the American journalist Luke Somers, were moved by AQAP to another location prior to the raid. The second attempt by U.S. Navy SEALs once again attempted to rescue the hostages, but Luke Somers and South African teacher Pierre Korkie were killed by AQAP during the raid in Shabwah Governorate of Yemen. Although the majority of hostages had been rescued, the operation was still seen as a failure in the West. The media particularly criticised the inability of American forces to rescue Somers. First raid and aftermath On 26 November 2014, a reinforced troop of U.S. Navy SEALs from DEVGRU supported by US- trained Yemeni special forces launched nighttime hostage rescue mission on a small number of caves in Hadhramaut Governorate. They landed at an off-set helicopter landing zone several kilometres away and patrolled on foot to the target area. In their assault on the cave, they killed 7 AQAP terrorists with one Yemeni SOF operator minorly wounded.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.302 8 hostages, none American, were freed, but Luke Somers and four others had been moved to another location by AQAP prior to the raid.

The SEALs conducted SSE and MH-60 helicopters flown by Nightstalkers extracted them.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.303 On 4 December 2014, AQAP threatened to execute Somers within three days if the US government failed to meet unspecified demands. AQAP also said that Somers would be killed if another attempt to rescue the hostages was launched. Second raid On 6 December 2014, after time sensitive intelligence indicated that an American hostage would be immediately executed by AQAP, 40 SEALs from DEVGRU used V-22 Ospreys to land 10 km from the compound in the Abadan Valley, where Somers and Korkie were kept at about 1 a.m. local time, according to a senior defense official. An AQAP fighter spotted them when the SEALs were less than 100 yards from the objectiveNeville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.304 whilst relieving himself outside, a counter-terrorism official with knowledge of the operation told ABC News, beginning a firefight that lasted about 10 minutes. According to CBS News, dog barking could have alerted the hostage takers of the operation. Both the American and South African hostage were immediately shot whilst, the DEVGRU assault team breached into the compound. The SEALs killed 6 AQAP terrorists When the American troops finally entered the building where Somers and Korkie were kept, they found both men alive, but gravely wounded. Whilst a JSOC medical unit who had inserted with DEVGRU began stabilising the wounded hostages whilst the SEALs secured the area for their extraction. The US forces pulled Somers and Korkie onto the Ospreys and medical teams began performing surgery in midair. Korkie died during the flight and Somers died after the Ospreys landed on the USS Makin Island. The entire operation took 30 minutes. Six AQAP fighters were killed, US officials said. No American troops were killed or injured in the raid. A video posted on a Jihadi website showed the fire fight between the Navy SEALs and AQAP fighters. Reactions Information \\"indicated that Luke's life was in imminent danger,\\" said US President Barack Obama. \\"Based on this assessment, and as soon as there was reliable intelligence and an operational plan, I authorized a rescue attempt.\\" He condemned the \\"barbaric murder\\" of Somers. \\"The callous disregard for Luke's life is more proof of the depths of AQAP's depravity, and further reason why the world must never cease in seeking to defeat their evil ideology,\\" Obama said in a statement. At the time of the raid, US special operations forces were unaware of the identity of the second hostage, Korkie. Korkie's release was imminent and had been negotiated by the South African organization Gift of the Givers. The organization's leader Dr. I. I. Sooliman said that the failed rescue had \\"destroyed everything\\". In a statement released on 8 December 2014, Somers family said they did not give the green light for the rescue operation and the ordeal could have been solved with more dialogue and less fighting.

Although New Mexico's board of nursing permitted the program to continue, accreditation is a prerequisite for employment in most hospitals and acceptance into other nursing programs, such as the one at New Mexico State. In 2010 the school had been placed on warning status by the commission for having an inadequate ratio of qualified instructors. A lawsuit filed in 2013 by eight nursing students alleges that the school had not notified students of the warning, and had been made aware of the problem as early as 2002. In May 2015, a state judge ruled that the lawsuit would be become a class action, and would include the 100 students enrolled at the time. In August 2015, it was announced that accreditation had been fully restored. This applied retroactively to students who graduated the previous May.

military installation in Dunbar, Scotland. History The barracks have their origins in a hotel known as the New Inn which provided accommodation for officers from 1797. Private soldiers, who were not allowed to use the New Inn, had to use tented accommodation at Belhaven Sands and West Barns Links during the Napoleonic Wars. The War Office acquired both the hotel and Lauderdale House (a large property designed by Robert Adam) and developed the whole site into barracks in 1855. During the First World War the barracks served as the 6th cavalry depot providing accommodation for the 1st King's Dragoon Guards, the 5th Dragoon Guards, the 1st Royal Dragoons and the 2nd Dragoons (Royal Scots Greys). During the Second World War the barracks served as headquarters for the 165th Officer Cadet Training Unit. The barracks were decommissioned in 1955 and the property sold to East Lothian County Council. Lauderdale House, which historically was also known as Dunbar House, was converted into flats in the 1990s.

The single example remained active until at least 2007. Design and development Jos√© Pocino's Toucan has a pod style fuselage with the pilot enclosed under a single piece canopy that continues the fuselage profile. The pilot's seat is ahead of the wing leading edge, with the pusher engine behind it. For its first flight the Toucan was powered by a Hirth two cylinder, two stroke engine, completely enclosed within the fuselage but this was soon replaced by a Rotax 503.2V engine of similar configuration, driving a three rather than two-bladed propeller. The engine change led to a slightly revised engine cowling and a decreased area of the cockpit transparency. A fixed tricycle undercarriage is mounted on the fuselage. Initially the main wheel legs were braced but have been replaced with cantilevers. The Toucan's wing is straight edged, of constant chord and square tipped, set low on the fuselage. There is some dihedral outboard of a brief centre section. From the wing roots two slender beams extend rearwards to cropped triangular fins, linked by a straight edged tailplane at about one third fin height. The unbalanced rudders are rectangular. The Toucan first flew on 6 November 1989, powered by the Hirth engine, and received its Certificate of Airworthiness on 9 December 1991. It flew at the RSA rallies in 2006 and 2007 and remains on the French Civil Aircraft Register in 2014.

The group offers services both under the Paysafe brand and subsidiary brands that have become part of the group through several mergers and acquisitions, most notably Neteller, Skrill and paysafecard. Paysafe is based in the Isle of Man and regulated in the United Kingdom, authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority. The company was listed on the London Stock Exchange and the FTSE 250 Index until it was acquired by a consortium of The Blackstone Group and CVC Capital Partners in December 2017. History The company was formed from the combination of Neteller PLC, Netbanx Ltd and Optimal Payments Limited. Netbanx was founded in 1996, Optimal Payments in 1997, and Neteller in 1999. In April 2004, Neteller PLC raised about $70 million in its initial public offering (IPO) on the London Stock Exchange. In November 2005, Neteller PLC acquired Netbanx Ltd. In November 2008, Neteller PLC renamed itself to Neovia Financial PLC. In February 2011, Neovia Financial PLC acquired Optimal Payments of Montreal, Canada. Next month, Neovia Financial PLC changed its name to Optimal Payments PLC. In early 2012, the acquisition was revealed to be a reverse takeover with the purging of a number of the senior management along with the chairman of the board. In July 2014, Optimal Payment PLC expanded its United States interests by purchasing Meritus Payment Solutions, a California based payment processing company, and Global Merchant Advisors, Inc. based in the U.S. in a deal worth over $235 Million. In March 2015, Optimal Payments PLC revealed that it would acquire rival Skrill group, including pre-paid voucher provider paysafecard, for a fee of around ‚Ç¨1.1 billion. In the same year, Optimal Payments rebranded as Paysafe Group. The company moved to the main market of the London Stock Exchange in December 2015. On 25 November, 2016, Paysafe Group, owner of Neteller and Skrill, restricted the use of the Net+ Prepaid MasterCard to countries within the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). This left users in over 100 countries unable to withdraw cash from ATM's, which left no recourse but to make purchases with Neteller/Skrill merchant partners or transfer funds to a bank account. In August 2017, it was announced that Paysafe would be sold to a consortium of The Blackstone Group and CVC Capital Partners for ¬£2.96 billion, making it the largest private equity backed takeover of a London- listed company since the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. The acquisition was approved by the European Commission on 22 November, 2017. On 21 December 2017, Paysafe got delisted from the London Stock Exchange. In April 2019, with the likelihood of the upcoming withdrawal of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU), the so-called \\"Brexit\\", Paysafe Group announced their plans to prevent any negative effects for their customers and merchants.

Early life and education Morrow was born Gertrude E. Comfort in San Francisco, California, and attended Alameda High School in the East Bay. She went on to get her B.A. in architecture from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1913 and her master's degree a year later. While still a student, she was \\"crowned\\" for her contribution to the design of a poster for the 1913 Partheneia performance, \\"The Awakening of Everymaid.\\" She also won a competition to design a coat of arms for the Gamma Phi Beta sorority, and her design is still in use by the sorority today. Architectural career After leaving the university, Gertrude worked in the office of Henry Gutterson. After she was issued her Architectural License by the state of California in 1916, she opened her own office in 1917 in downtown San Francisco and worked under her maiden name for several years. When her former employer was called into war camp service, he asked Gertrude to handle his duties as the Supervising Architect of St. Francis Wood, which was an emerging residential district. She designed about ten homes in this district, which were traditional in style. During World War I, for example, she was the supervising architect for the development of St. Francis Woods, a middle-class enclave in San Francisco where Ida McCain also built some houses. Other projects of hers include the Women's Athletic Club in Oakland, California, and the music building at the Monrovian Seminary and College for Women in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. In 1920, she married architect Irving F. Morrow, after which she used Gertrude Comfort Morrow as her professional name. In 1922 the Morrows' daughter was born, and around this time the couple set up the firm Morrow & Morrow and collaborated on many architectural projects between 1925 and 1940, in both San Francisco and the East Bay. The most famous of the projects they worked on together between 1930 and 1937 was the design of the geometrically stylized Art Deco towers, walkways, railings, and lighting of the Golden Gate Bridge, as well as its famous International Orange paint scheme. Although Irving Morrow is usually given sole credit for these features of the bridge design, the Morrows' daughter stated that her mother had had a hand in it. In addition, there is at least one letter from Irving Morrow discussing Morrow & Morrow's design ideas for the bridge in which the pronouns 'we', 'us', and 'our' are used throughout. Another joint project was the modernist Alameda- Contra Costa County Building for the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition at Treasure Island. In the early 1930s, the Morrows designed an International Style house in the Forest Hill area for San Francisco State College professor Olive Cowell (stepmother of composer Henry Cowell) that is cited as the first truly modern house in San Francisco. This house was an exception, however, as most of the houses Morrow & Morrow built were more conventional. Gertrude closed Morrow & Morrow and retired from architecture when Irving died in 1952, turning her efforts in other directions. She became an award-winning ballroom dancer, and she also painted landscapes in watercolor. She died in Tucson, Arizona, at the age of 95. Her papers are part of the Irving F. and Gertrude Comfort Morrow Collection at UC Berkeley, which includes photographs and drawings of her work, together with various other documents and records.

At the time of his death at age sixty-five, Murray was vice president and treasurer of the United States Playing Card Company, and a director of the W. B. Oglesby Paper Company of Middletown, Ohio. His block of stock in the United States Playing Card Company was said to be worth $1,000,000. Called \\"a mechanical genius, the marvel and admiration of the technical and inventive world,\\" Murray made his mark on the United States Playing Card Company by creating and installing manufacturing equipment, such as an automatic punch machine which \\"increased the output of cards fourfold\\" and reduced labor costs by sixty-six percent. With the automatic punch machine, great sheets of paper were fed into the machine and came out as complete packs of playing cards, printed in four colors.

Morgan of the Russell & Morgan Company, to assist in the manufacture of playing cards at their plant in Cincinnati. Here, Murray thrived and with him, the fortunes of Russell & Morgan. \\"The advent of Mr. Murray marked the advancement of the concern to the first rank as a playing card manufacturing establishment. He not only made the plant highly efficient, but when he found that any device was needed he evolved it himself and astounded his company by his ability to meet any emergency no matter how difficult.\\" Murray had a falling out with Russell & Morgan and in 1886 went off on his own to form the National Playing Card Company in Indianapolis ‚Äì a move that Russell & Morgan came to regret. According to one source, as a competitor, Murray \\"was a serious menace to the Russell & Morgan Company and as a matter of self preservation, the latter bought him out, consolidating the Indianapolis concern with the United States Playing Card Company.\\" As a concession, Murray was given a \\"block of stock in the merger\\" and \\"unrestricted charge of the manufacture of playing cards.\\" After this, he was steadfast in his loyalty to the United States Playing Card Company, even turning down an offer of $2 million by a big printing house in New York.

Piedrabuena, Ciudad Real, 6 November 1961), was a Spanish electrical engineer, inventor and industrialist, an early developer of high frequency electrical conduction equipment, mobile telephony, radiology, electrotherapy and the first portable x-ray machine in 1909.  Early life  S√°nchez's family owned a small tile and brick plant, and his mother took in laundry, which she washed in an area of the river known as the Tabla de la Yedra. He was the youngest of four children and helped his mother with the washing.

The teacher at the local school encouraged M√≥nico to continue his studies and, without finishing the lower level of High School, he left for Madrid with the intention of studying electrical engineering. Madrid in 1901 was in the process of introducing both electric street-lighting and electrified trams, replacing those pulled by animals. However, the Electrical Engineering school was closed by student strikes, and S√°nchez enrolled in a correspondence course in the subject offered by Joseph Wetzle from London.

It was built in 1935. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 August 2003.  History  The former Brisbane City Council Tramways substation no 9 was built to the design of Brisbane City Council Tramways architect Roy Rusden Ogg around 1935 during a period of tramways expansion. Horse-drawn trams operated in Brisbane from August 1885, operated by an English company, Metropolitan Tramway and Investment Co. Ltd. The first public supply of electricity in Brisbane was from a generator in Edison Lane, which supplied the General Post Office in 1888. Early development in the industry was in the hands of a number of private companies and the situation was complex because the metropolitan area comprised fourteen separate local authorities. After various liquidations and restructurings the City Electric Light Company Limited (CEL) was established in 1904. Parallel development took place in electric traction. The Brisbane Tramways Company, a private enterprise formed in 1895, introduced the first electric trams to Brisbane in 1897 after purchasing the early horse car system, converting it to electric operation and expanding and extending the routes. A power station to supply current to the electric trams was constructed in Countess Street in 1897. The tramway system extended out into the suburbs, the Countess Street power station was unable to supply all the energy requirements. Two engine sets from Countess Street were transferred to a building in Logan Road to provide for a feeding point for the system on the south side of the river. Supply was also fed from the tramway 550-volt DC mains to a number of establishments along the tramway routes, such as butcher shops, sawmills and factories. By 1918, the whole of the tramways public power supply equipment in South Brisbane was sold to the City Electric Light Company, which developed a supply for South Brisbane from its power station in William Street. At the conclusion of the First World War there was general support for the notion that the tramway system be owned and operated by a public authority rather than a private company. In 1922, an Act of Parliament inaugurated the Brisbane Tramway Trust. The establishment in 1925 of the Brisbane City Council created a single public authority that could plan for the provision of electrical services throughout the entire city. Expansion of electricity supply and the development of better public transport networks were important issues for the Greater Brisbane City Council and were closely linked to suburban development. At this time the situation of energy generation and supply was chaotic. Three small obsolete power stations generated energy for trams and electricity for Ithaca and Toowong and the supply for all other suburbs was purchased in bulk from CEL under 10 year agreements. The 1920s and 1930s was a period of tramways expansion following the BCC acquisition of the tramways system from the Brisbane Tramways Trust in 1925. In 1926 the Greater Brisbane Council, anxious to control the city's electricity supply, decided to build its own powerhouse at New Farm, under the supervision of the BCC Tramways Department. Opened on 28 June 1928, New Farm Power Station distributed 1100 kW AC power to a network of 11 suburban tramways substations erected in the 1920s and 1930s. The substations were located at strategic points throughout the system - substations No. 2 (Russell Street) and No. 6 (Windsor) came into service in 1927, No. 4 (Petrie Terrace) and No. 5 (Newstead) in 1928; Substation No. 9 (Norman Park) came on line in 1935. Considerable attention was given to the design of the substations serving the tramway system. The architecture was marked by the stylistic preferences of individual architects particularly the Brisbane City Architects AH Foster and FG Costello and the BCC Tramways architect RR Ogg. Although they were robust utility buildings, generally small in scale, elegant proportions and such details as finely crafted brickwork distinguished them. Prior to 1940, their design was the responsibility of BCC Tramways Department architect and construction engineer, Roy Rusden Ogg. In conjunction with the tramway's chief engineers Nelson and Arundell, he designed at least 10 Brisbane substations between 1926 and 1936 and the first two stages of the New Farm powerhouse. Ogg also designed the Tramways Departments Head Office building on Coronation Drive in 1929. The Norman Park substation remained in service until the phasing out of Brisbane's trams in the late 1960s. In 1969 the line was closed and the substation's electrical equipment was removed, though the travelling crane remains. The building became a State Emergency Services Depot and changes were made to the interior to accommodate this use. The lower level of the original two level floor has been extended to park a rescue boat and a steel and timber framed mezzanine floor has been inserted in the main building space. A single storey garage was added on the northern side Since 2007, the substation has been leased by Metro Arts as artists' studios. Its newfound role has attracted the opening of the ArtWorld Studio Gallery on the adjacent Bodalla Street.  Description  Upper floor, 2015 The former substation is a two-storey building of austere appearance and is constructed of dark, glazed brick. It occupies most of the block at the corner of Wynnum Road and Norman Avenue with its long axis at right angles to Wynnum Road to the north. The metal clad roof is concealed by a stepped parapet and engaged piers form shallow decorative panels in the brickwork. The building is placed on a flush rendered plinth and the high window openings have heads and sills of concrete render. Finely detailed sheet metal rainwater heads and downpipes are prominently placed on the north and south elevations and contribute to the verticality of the design. The western side, facing Norman Avenue, features a large steel roller shutter protected by a curved metal hood. The southern end of the building has been extended to accommodate a toilet. This single storey extension features panels of English bond and garden bond brickwork formed between engaged corner piers. Remnant concrete slabs and brick walls provide evidence of previous structures near this extension. The interior has been modified to accommodate State Emergency Service use. A steel and timber framed floor has been inserted into the main volume of the building and the ceiling formed is lined with fibrous cement sheeting finished with timber cover strips. The lower level of the original floor is used to park a rescue boat and accommodates a secure mesh enclosure. A kitchen and dining area occupy the upper level of this floor. The original travelling crane remains, running north south for the entire length of the building and supported on steel rails resting on corbelled brickwork. All of the internal brickwork has been painted white. A sheet metal and concrete block garage has been erected between the former substation and Wynnum Road.  Heritage listing  The former Brisbane City Council Tramways Substation No 9 was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 August 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former tramways substation is important in demonstrating an important aspect of Queensland's industrial development and is closely linked to Brisbane's suburban expansion in the 1920s and 30s and with the development of the electricity supply system. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The former substation is now uncommon evidence for an important mode of transport, which was discontinued in Brisbane in 1969 and for which much of the infrastructure has since been removed. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. In design, scale and materials, the former substation is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of the Brisbane tramways substations. As a well-conceived utility structure, it is important as a fine example of the municipal work of tramways architect Roy Rusden Ogg. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The former substation contributes to the streetscape, its quality of design and materials enabling the prominently placed building to successfully combine function and a pleasing appearance. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. As a well-conceived utility structure, it is important as a fine example of the municipal work of tramways architect Roy Rusden Ogg.

Biography Born to a Lebanese-American family in Virginiahttps://twitter.com/MattShaheen/status/1145327323882950656, Shaheen received a bachelor's degree from Randolph-Macon College in Ashland near the capital city of Richmond, at which he received All Conference honors through the Old Dominion Athletic Conference as a player on the college Yellow Jackets football team. Shaheen also holds a master's degree from Southern Methodist University in University Park, Texas. Since 2004, he has been a technology and management consulting executive, with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Services. Shaheen is a deacon at the large Prestonwood Baptist Church in Plano and directs a Bible study for inmates in the Collin County jail. Political life Shaheen is the former Precinct 1 commissioner for Collin County, one of four legislative positions in county government which encompasses North Plano, Frisco, Prosper, Celina, and northwestern McKinney. As a county commissioner, he served on the Texas Conference of Urban Counties Policy Committee and the Texas Juvenile Justice Department Advisory Committee. Then Governor Rick Perry named him to the Texas State Board of Social Workers, for which he was chairman of the board's Professional Development Committee and a member of the Ethics Committee. He has also served on the Plano Community Relations Commission. A past election judge, precinct chairman, and delegate to Republican state conventions, Shaheen is the founding chairman of the political action committee, the Reagan Conservative Society.

Historically, the English-language comic-book field has been male-dominated. This has led to rampant sexism and the harassment of female fans and creators in the comics industry. Historical exclusion of women The 1940s and 1950s in America were a time when comic books rose to prominence in the public eye. There was a rise in the type and number of comics being published. Where before, comics had only found homes on the pages of newspapers, and were used as tools to sell papers and attract new readers, by the 40s and 50s, comics were becoming their own medium, independent from the papers, and being featured in their own magazines and comic books. According to David Hajdu: > By 1952, more than twenty publishers were producing nearly 650 comics titles > per month, employing well over a thousand artists, writers, editors, > letterers, and others‚Äîamong them women, as well as untold members of racial, > ethnic, and social minorities who turned to comics because they thought of > themselves or their ideas as unwelcome in more reputable spheres of > publishing and entertainment. According to Trina Robbins, many girls and young women were reading comics at that time: > In one year‚Äî1948‚Äì1949‚Äîromance comic titles jumped from four to 125, more > than one quarter of comic books published were romance comics. This was the > same year that a graph in Newsdealer magazine showed that females age > seventeen to twenty-five were reading more comic books than guys. It is clear that many girls were engaging with the medium by reading romance comics, but writer Suzanne Scott warns in her 2013 essay Fangirls in refrigerators: The politics of (in)visibility in comic book culture that: > ...comics scholarship often essentializes women's taste in comics among > gendered genre lines, at the expense of engaging with the (admittedly small > but robust) female audience for mainstream comics. In 1946, the National Cartoonists Society was formed in the United States of America. Women were excluded from the organization. Three years after its formation, the cartoonist Hilda Terry sent the National Cartoonists Society a letter saying: > We must humbly request that you either alter your title to the National Men > Cartoonists Society ... or discontinue whatever rule or practice you have > which bars otherwise qualified women cartoonists. She was accepted into the group the following year, and immediately nominated several other female cartoonists for membership. In 1976, Trina Robbins produced Wet Satin, an anthology of erotic comics for women, by women. The printer used by publisher Kitchen Sink Press refused to publish it, denouncing it as pornographic. The same printer had previously published a sex book by all male creators, which according to Robbins had \\"such an obscene cover it had to be covered with plain white paper before it could even be distributed to the comic book stores\\". As Robbins tells it: > The printer insisted that the male sex book, Bizarre Sex, was satire, while > Wet Satin was serious and therefore objectionable. Yet the underground sex > newspaper Screw, hardly a feminist journal, said in a review, \\"The humour in > Wet Satin is another welcome change from other undergrounds... What might > have been a tedious and boring look into the sexual psyche of 'liberated' > women turns out to be a series of clever, satirical, and entertaining > cartoon strips.\\" The popular women's comics anthology Wimmen's Comix, which ran for twenty years, ended its run in 1992. In explaining the reason for its end, editor Caryn Leschen said: > This book has been printed on cheap paper which will turn yellow in a few > years. The print run was too small and all the stores, as usual, will sell > out, but they won't reorder because 'Women don't buy comix.' Bullshit. How > did they sell out in the first place? It's always like that. What a waste of > time and energy. Forget it.\\" Modern day gender gap In modern-day American comics, there is still a wide gender gap in the profession. This is evidenced in Tim Haley's ongoing study called 'Gendercrunching' on the website Bleeding Cool. Since 2011, Hanley has looked at the monthly titles published by Marvel Comics and DC Comics, breaking down how many men and women are working on each title. In his August 2014 results, which are typical of the general results, 9.5% of people working on DC's titles were female, and 90.5% were male, as well, 9.8% of the people working on Marvel's titles that month were female and 90.2% were male. Similarly, user deantlogic on LiveJournal broke down the number of men and women included in The Best American Comics Series published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Of the nine books in the series, six men acted as guest editors, and three women acted as guest editors, and of the 291 artists included, 222 were men and 69 were women. In 2011, DC Comics relaunched many of its titles, christening this new beginning The New 52. While the gender balance in DC's creative teams has never been close to even, as shown in Tim Haley's ongoing \\"Gendercrunching\\" study, the number of women working on DC's titles dropped from 12% to 1% with this relaunch. Suzanne Scott recounts the events of the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con where a woman dressed as the comic book character Batgirl, questioned creators and publishers at DC Comics about the company's gender imbalance. The woman dressed as Batgirl, known as Kyrax2, waited in line at panels about the launch of the New 52 and asked questions about which creators and characters would be featured, and commented on the gender imbalance in the material she saw. As Scott notes, Kyrax2 was not the only one asking these questions: : One sound bite that circulated widely featured a male fan posing a similar question, only to be testily challenged and ultimately silenced by DC copublisher Dan Didio. In an interview with DC Women Kicking Ass, Kyrax2 talked about her experience at San Diego in 2011. Kyrax2 had noticed that the makeup of every panel she had been to at the convention was overwhelmingly male. At the panel, during the question period, she asked the panelists if they were committed to hiring more women. The response that she received from Dan Didio was that he was \\"committed to hiring the absolute best writers and artists,\\" to which she asked, \\"Are you saying you can't find any great women writers or artists?\\" According to Kyrax2, the audience reaction was furious: > People yelled at me to 'sit down!' and shouted out Gail Simone‚Äôs name over > and over again. I said, \\"Yes, I met Gail Simone yesterday. I like her very > much. But I've attended all these other panels, and with the exception of > her and one female editor, they‚Äôve all been male.\\" In an anonymously authored article from December 2013 on The Comics Journal website, a female writer shares a letter of harassment they received saying: > I don't normally feel like being a woman in this field is enough to justify > having to answer questions about it all the time, most frequently: \\"What is > it like to be a woman cartoonist?\\" Let's face it, this is not dangerous > work. This is not even physically demanding. I am not a police officer, I am > not a fireman, I am not in the army. I don't put my life on the line every > day. They go on to say: > There are struggles. I would be a fool to deny that. I face the same > anxieties as many of my male counterparts, but the difference is that once > in a while something kind of gross happens: a weird pass is made, a sexist > comment is said, someone checks me out, or some creep corners me at an art > opening. Those are the real challenges of being a woman doing ANYTHING. In a 2014 article on Comics Alliance about why women in comics do not speak up about sexual harassment, Juliet Kahn opens by saying: > I have been a woman in the comics industry for a few months now. It has been > wonderful. It has also been terrifying. She explains that: > When you grow up enveloped in the miasma of \\"tits or GTFO,\\" \\"attention > whore\\" and \\"fake geek girl,\\" fear becomes the price you pay to enjoy you > hobbies. You don't even think of it as fear most of the time. Sometimes you > join in the fear mongering yourself, enjoying the a**hole glamour of not > being too pussy to call another girl a slut. Sometimes you hide in woman- > heavy spaces, which go maligned elsewhere (\\"Tumblrinas!\\") but do a pretty > solid job of keeping you safe. The fear comes back eventually, though, as a > slew of graphic rape threats or a simple joke about \\"feminazis\\" you are > expected to chuckle along with. It might be in response to a screed worthy > of Andrea Dworkin--or maybe you just tweeted something about disliking > Guardians of the Galaxy. What matters is that you were a woman with an > opinion on the internet, and now you must be punished. You must be made to > fear. In her comics column on Comics Alliance, Kate Leth wrote: > If you are a woman in comics people will always be asking you: What's it > like being a woman in comics? The question has always bothered me--it's > never really mattered. The world of Indie and webcomics has always felt > fairly welcoming and balanced. Queer-friendly, too!

On 8 April 1900 he founded in Rome on the Albanian National Committee (), which ideologically filming the wake of the old Albanian National Society chaired by De Rada, Lorecchio and Camodeca de Coronei; this committee basically supposed adherence to all the initiatives that they were in favor of the independence of Albania, without ever having to resort to any act of violence. In 1904 he published The Albanian political thought in relation to the interests of Italy, a book that he wrote in order to succeed in some way, in addition to tracking an initial budget of the early years of his magazine, to raise awareness of the Italian government and the general public on the importance of the Albanian question and the interests of Italy in the Adriatic and the Mediterranean. During June 1904, Lorecchio along with Gasp√´r Jakova M√´rturi published an Italian language daily newspaper Agenzia Balcanica ed Italiana that focused on politics, finance and commercial information.

In 1912, after a few days after the proclamation of independence of the Albanian state and the constitution of the government of Vlora, Ismail Qemali personally thanked Lorecchio saying, \\"Your wishes for the fulfillment of our common ideals come to us very welcome. We are sure of sympathy and warm support of all Albanians in Italy.

Portrait  Berlin Antikensammlung Bust in the Vatican Museum with inscription The Roman copies of the bust of Pericles derive from a bronze statue made by the sculptor Kresilas. This life-size statue was probably installed on the Athenian Acropolis at or shortly after the death of the politician.Max Kunze argues for shortly after his death, Michael Siebler for 430 BC. Pausanias says that the statue was directly beyond the Propylaea, the gate to the Acropolis. Since this statue is not preserved and only limited information is known about it, its arrangement is unclear and its details can only be guessed at by analogies and assumptions. Pericles was not shown in a realistic fashion, but as an idealised image of the long-serving strategos. Whether he was depicted naked, clothed or in full armour is disputed.Kunze is certain that he was naked, Siebler holds that all possibilities are possible. Remains of the statue's base were preserved with a dedicatory inscription. A slot in the base indicates that the statue held a spear in its left hand. The slight turning of the head indicates that the statue employed classical Contrapposto. Pericles is depicted as an adult man with a Corinthian helmet. The helmet symbolised his military role as strategos. The Berlin copy is especially carefully executed. The helmet is cocked back, with short curly hair bursting out at the temples. The beard is tightly cropped with many small, well-ordered curls. Broad, even eyelids ring the eyes and eyebrows are carved above. His full lips are slightly open. Behind the eyeholes of his helmet, further hair can be seen (as in two of the three other copies). This hair, far above where his head would be expected to end, might hint at Pericles' unusually shaped head, which is occasionally referenced in Attic Comedy by the abusive nickname \\"Leek- head.\\" (Also see Plutarch's 'Life of Perikles') This deformity was said to be the reason why Pericles was always depicted in a Corinthian helmet, since this would conceal the height of his head. The presence of the hair in the eyeholes should probably therefore be seen as the addition of a learned sculptor. Kresilas created a kind of symbol of the Athenian democracy with this image of Pericles. However the sculpture also conformed to the broadly accepted citizen ideal of the times and employed the calm and collected facial expression which was the contemporary ideal. As a result, the realistic tendencies of Athenian art, which are found to some extent in the bust of Themistocles were abandoned. The expression is serious, showing no emotion. In this the depiction squares with self-controlled personality attributed to Pericles in the historical tradition. The identification of this idealised figure with Pericles is made because two of the copies are inscribed: one in the Vatican Museum, the other in the British Museum.

The two-story brick school has a Romanesque-influenced design planned by John William Kennedy. The school was built in 1914 to replace Glen Carbon's one-room schoolhouse, which its student population had outgrown. A four-room frame building supplemented both the old and new schools, so Glen Carbon had eight classrooms in total with its new school. Grades one through four were taught in the new building, while the upper grades used the frame building. The school was part of the Edwardsville school district, and students who wished to attend high school did so in Edwardsville. Glen Carbon was a European immigrant community, and its students reflected the village's wide variety of ethnic groups. The parents of the village, who mainly worked as coal miners, often volunteered for school events. When a new school opened in 1954, the village purchased the building for office space; it now houses the Glen Carbon Historical Museum. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 25, 2014.

The village is situated about 1 1/2 miles north-east of Crediton. It is located close to Shobrooke park. The river Shobrooke Lake flows through the village. It had a population of 537 according to the 2011 census. The name Shobrooke is derived from the old English words of succa and br≈çc, and translates as goblin brook. History Shobrooke has also been known as \\"Shobrook\\", the 1809 Ordnance Survey map refers the Parish and the village as Shobrook. Furthermore, in 1583 marriage records the village is once again referred to as Shobrook, it is not known if this was an error or the name of the village has evolved over time. The name itself has Anglo-Saxon origins, recorded in 938AD as Old English 'Sceocabroc' roughly translated as \\"Goblin brook\\" or \\"brook haunted by an evil spirit\\", this changed to Sotebroca in the Domesday book. Ordnance Survey Map of Shobrooke from 1809. In the 1870s, Shobrooke is described as: : A parish, with a village, in Crediton district, Devon; 2 miles NE of Crediton r. station. It has a post-office under Crediton, North Devon. Acres, 3835. Real property, ¬£6,004. Pop. in 1851, 812; in 1861, 630. Houses, 133. St. Swithun's Church is the oldest structure in the village, the church is of Anglo Saxon origins and was rebuilt in the 15th Century, and restored further around 1840 and in 1879. The building has been Grade II listed since 1965. The Red Lion Inn is the last remaining pub in Shobrooke, the pub dates back to the 1580s making it one of the oldest structures in the village. The name of the Red Lion Inn has changed over time, in 1850 the pub was known as The Lion. The Shobrooke 1914‚Äì1918 War Memorial holds the names of 25 men who lost their lives in World War One, the list includes the names of three brothers from the Horwell family, all three died within 15 months of one another. Population change and housing Total population of the Civil Parish of Shobrooke, as reported by the Census of Population 1881‚Äì2011 As of the 2011 Census Shobrooke has a population of 537, this is however down from the Parish population peak of 812 in the 1851 census. The population of the Parish has however been on a steady increase since the 1961 census when the population was just 375, this is an average increase in population of 2.7 persons per year. Housing change in the Parish of Shobrooke from 1831‚Äì2011. The growth in the population between 1961 and 2001 can be explained through an increase in the number of houses in the Parish. The graph below shows that the number of houses in the Parish increased from 123 in 1961 to 215 in 2001. Over this period of time from 1831‚Äì2011 the overall number of houses in the Parish has increased by 96 properties. Occupation Graph showing the employment in the parish of Shobrooke in 1881. Graph showing the employment data for Shobrooke in 2011. When looking at the occupation structure of Shobrooke it is clear to see that in 1881 the majority of employment was in agriculture, with 104 out of 641 people. Other prominent areas of employment in the Parish were Domestic Services or Offices, which was the largest employment sector for women in the Parish with 38 people employed. It appears that unemployment in the village at the time based upon \\"Unknown Occupation\\" was 16.07%. In comparison, in the 2011 census 19 people were employed in \\"Elementary Occupations\\" which includes agriculture, this 3.53% of the Parish population compared to 16.22% in 1881. In 2011 the largest employment sector was Professionals with 60 residents employed in this sector, this is followed by 41 people who described themselves as \\"Skilled Trades Person\\". In contrast to 1881 only 9 people in 2011 were unemployed, this is an unemployment rate of 1.67%. Historic estates and buildings A number of historic estates exist in the Parish of Shobrooke. The most well known is that of Shobrooke Park also known as Little Fulford or Shobrooke House. According to local legend the name of Shobrooke Park was changed from Fulford Park due to a funeral director going to a different Fulford Park near Tedburn St Mary. Little Fulford served as a school during the Second World War for St Peter's Court, a preparatory school evacuated from Broadstairs, Kent, but burnt down in on 23 January 1945 with the loss of two pupils. The site was empty until 1975 when the present owner Sir John Richard Shelley, 11th Baronet built a new house on the land.

There are several variations of interfacial polymerization, which result in several types of polymer topologies, such as ultra-thin films, nanocapsules, and nanofibers, to name just a few. An example of a Schotten-Baumann reaction. Benzylamine reacts with acetyl chloride under Schotten-Baumann conditions to form N-benzylacetamide.  History  Interfacial polymerization (then termed \\"interfacial polycondensation\\") was first discovered by Emerson L. Wittbecker and Paul W. Morgan in 1959 as an alternative to the typically high-temperature and low- pressure melt polymerization technique. As opposed to melt polymerization, interfacial polymerization reactions can be accomplished using standard laboratory equipment and under atmospheric conditions. This first interfacial polymerization was accomplished using the Schotten‚ÄìBaumann reaction, a method to synthesize amides from amines and acid chlorides. In this case, a polyamide, usually synthesized via melt polymerization, was synthesized from diamine and diacid chloride monomers. The diacid chloride monomers were placed in an organic solvent (benzene) and the diamene monomers in a water phase, such that when the monomers reached the interface they would polymerize. Since 1959, interfacial polymerization has been extensively researched and used to prepare not only polyamides but also polyanilines, polyimides, polyurethanes, polyureas, polypyrroles, polyesters, polysulfonamides, polyphenyl esters and polycarbonates. In recent years, polymers synthesized by interfacial polymerization have been used in applications where a particular topological or physical property is desired, such as conducting polymers for electronics, water purification membranes, and cargo-loading microcapsules. Mechanism Five common types of interfacial polymerization interfaces (from left to right): liquid-solid, liquid-liquid, and liquid-in-liquid emulsion. There are two examples each for liquid-liquid and liquid-in-liquid emulsion, either using one monomer or two. The most commonly used interfacial polymerization methods fall into 3 broad types of interfaces: liquid-solid interfaces, liquid-liquid interfaces, and liquid-in-liquid emulsion interfaces. In the liquid-liquid and liquid-in-liquid emulsion interfaces, either one or both liquid phases may contain monomers. There are also other interface categories, rarely used, including liquid-gas, solid-gas, and solid-solid. In a liquid- solid interface, polymerization begins at the interface, and results in a polymer attached to the surface of the solid phase. In a liquid-liquid interface with monomer dissolved in one phase, polymerization occurs on only one side of the interface, whereas in liquid-liquid interfaces with monomer dissolved in both phases, polymerization occurs on both sides. An interfacial polymerization reaction may proceed either stirred or unstirred. In a stirred reaction, the two phases are combined using vigorous agitation, resulting in a higher interfacial surface area and a higher polymer yield. In the case of capsule synthesis, the size of the capsule is directly determined by the stirring rate of the emulsion. Although interfacial polymerization appears to be a relatively straightforward process, there are several experimental variables that can be modified in order to design specific polymers or modify polymer characteristics. Some of the more notable variables include the identity of the organic solvent, monomer concentration, reactivity, solubility, the stability of the interface, and the number of functional groups present on the monomers. The identity of the organic solvent is of utmost importance, as it affects several other factors such as monomer diffusion, reaction rate, and polymer solubility and permeability. The number of functional groups present on the monomer is also important, as it affects the polymer topology: a di-substituted monomer will form linear chains whereas a tri- or tetra-substituted monomer forms branched polymers. Most interfacial polymerizations are synthesized on a porous support in order to provide additional mechanical strength, allowing delicate nano films to be used in industrial applications. In this case, a good support would consist of pores ranging from 1 to 100 nm. Free-standing films, by contrast, do not use a support, and are often used to synthesize unique topologies such as micro- or nanocapsules. In the case of polyurethanes and polyamides especially, the film can be pulled continuously from the interface in an unstirred reaction, forming \\"ropes\\" of polymeric film. As the polymer precipitates, it can be withdrawn continuously. It is interesting to note that the molecular weight distribution of polymers synthesized by interfacial polymerization is broader than the Flory‚ÄìSchulz distribution due to the high concentration of monomers near the interfacial site. Because the two solutions used in this reaction are immiscible and the rate of reaction is high, this reaction mechanism tends to produce a small number of long polymer chains of high molecular weight.  Mathematical Models  Interfacial polymerization has proven difficult to model accurately due to its nature as a nonequilibrium process. These models provide either analytical or numerical solutions. The wide range of variables involved in interfacial polymerization has led to several different approaches and several different models. One of the more general models of interfacial polymerization, summarized by Berezkin and co-workers, involves treating interfacial polymerization as a heterogenous mass transfer combined with a second-order chemical reaction. In order to take into account different variables, this interfacial polymerization model is divided into three scales, yielding three different models: the kinetic model, the local model, and the macrokinetic model. The kinetic model is based on the principles of kinetics, assumes uniform chemical distribution, and describes the system at a molecular level. This model takes into account thermodynamic qualities such as mechanisms, activation energies, rate constants, and equilibrium constants. The kinetic model is typically incorporated into either the local or the macrokinetic model in order to provide greater accuracy. The local model is used to determine the characteristics of polymerization at a section around the interface, termed the diffusion boundary layer. This model can be used to describe a system in which the monomer distribution and concentration are inhomogeneous, and is restricted to a small volume. Parameters determined using the local model include the mass transfer weight, the degree of polymerization, topology near the interface, and the molecular weight distribution of the polymer. Using local modeling, the dependence of monomer mass transfer characteristics and polymer characteristics as a function of kinetic, diffusion, and concentration factors can be analyzed. One approach to calculating a local model can be represented by the following differential equation: {\\\\partial c_i\\\\over\\\\partial t} = {\\\\partial\\\\over\\\\partial y}(D_i{\\\\partial c_i\\\\over\\\\partial y}) + J_i in which ci is the molar concentration of functional groups in the ith component of a monomer or polymer, t is the elapsed time, y is a coordinate normal to the surface/interface, Di is the molecular diffusion coefficient of the functional groups of interest, and Ji is the thermodynamic rate of reaction. Although precise, no analytical solution exists for this differential equation, and as such solutions must be found using approximate or numerical techniques. In the macrokinetic model, the progression of an entire system is predicted. One important assumption of the macrokinetic model is that each mass transfer process is independent, and can therefore be described by a local model. The macrokinetic model may be the most important, as it can provide feedback on the efficiency of the reaction process, important in both laboratory and industrial applications. More specific approaches to modeling interfacial polymerization are described by Ji and co-workers, and include modeling of thin-film composite (TFC) membranes, tubular fibers, hollow membranes, and capsules. These models take into account both reaction- and diffusion- controlled interfacial polymerization under non-steady-state conditions. One model is for thin film composite (TFC) membranes, and describes the thickness of the composite film as a function of time: t = -({E_0 \\\\over B_0} + {A_0D_0 \\\\over B_0^2} + {C_0A_0^2 \\\\over B_0^2}) \\\\ln(1-{X \\\\over X_{max}})-{C_0 \\\\over 2B_0}X^2 - ({D_0 \\\\over B_0}+{C_0A_0 \\\\over B_0^2})X Where A0, B0, C0, D0, and E0 are constants determined by the system, X is the film thickness, and Xmax is the maximum value of film thickness, which can be determined experimentally. Another model for interfacial polymerization of capsules, or encapsulation, is also described: t = A_0{R_{min}}^5E_0I_4 + B_0{R_{min}}^4E_0I_3 + C_0{R_{min}}^2E_0I_2 + D_0{R_{min}}E_0I_1 Where A0, B0, C0, D0, E0, I1, I2, I3, and I4 are constants determined by the system and Rmin is the minimum value of the inside diameter of the polymeric capsule wall. There are several assumptions made by these and similar models, including but not limited to uniformity of monomer concentration, temperature, and film density, and second-order reaction kinetics.  Applications  Interfacial polymerization has found much use in industrial applications, especially as a route to synthesize conducting polymers for electronics. Conductive polymers synthesized by interfacial polymerization such as polyaniline (PANI), Polypyrrole (PPy), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), and polythiophene (PTh) have found applications as chemical sensors, fuel cells, supercapacitors, and nanoswitches. = Sensors = PANI nanofibers are the most commonly used for sensing applications. These nanofibers have been shown to detect various gaseous chemicals, such as hydrogen chloride (HCl), ammonia (NH3), Hydrazine (N2H4), chloroform (CHCl3), and methanol (CH3OH). PANI nanofibers can be further fined-tuned by doping and modifying the polymer chain conformation, among other methods, to increase selectivity to certain gases. A typical PANI chemical sensor consists of a substrate, an electrode, and a selective polymer layer. PANI nanofibers, like other chemiresistors, detect by a change in electrical resistance/conductivity in response to the chemical environment. = Fuel Cells = PPy-coated ordered mesoporouscarbon (OMC) composites can be used in direct methanol fuel cell applications. The polymerization of PPy onto the OMC reduces interfacial electrical resistances without altering the open mesopore structure, making PPy-coated OMC composites a more ideal material for fuel cells than plain OMCs. = Separation/Purification Membranes = Composite polymer films synthesized via a liquid-solid interface are the most commonly used to synthesize membranes for reverse osmosis and other applications. One added benefits of using polymers prepared by interfacial polymerization is that several properties, such as pore size and interconnectivity, can be fined-tuned to create a more ideal product for specific applications. For example, synthesizing a polymer with a pore size somewhere between the molecular size of hydrogen gas (H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) results in a membrane selectively-permeable to H2, but not to CO2, effectively separating the compounds. = Cargo-loading Micro- and Nanocapsules = Compared to previous methods of capsule synthesis, interfacial polymerization is an easily modified synthesis that results in capsules with a wide range of properties and functionalities. Once synthesized, the capsules can enclose drugs, quantum dots, and other nanoparticles, to list a few examples. Further fine-tuning of the chemical and topological properties of these polymer capsules could prove an effective route to create drug-delivery systems.

Such compounds are intermediates in many catalytic reactions that convert alkynes to other organic products, e.g. hydrogenation and trimerization.Elschenbroich, C. ‚ÄùOrganometallics‚Äù 2006 Wiley-VCH: Weinheim. . Synthesis Transition metal alkyne complexes are often formed by the displacement of labile ligands by the alkyne. For example, a variety of cobalt-alkyne complexes may be formed by reaction of the alkyne with dicobalt octacarbonyl.Kemmitt, R. D. W.; Russell, D. R.; \\"Cobalt\\" in Comprehensive Organometallic Chemistry I; Abel, E.W.; Stone, F.G.A.; Wilkinson, G. eds., 1982, Pergamon Press, Oxford. : Co2(CO)8 \\\\+ R2C2 ‚Üí Co2(C2R2)(CO)6 \\\\+ 2 CO Many alkyne complexes are produced by reduction of metal halides, e.g. titanocene dichloride and bis(triphenylphosphine)platinum dichloride in the presence of the alkyne: : Cp2TiCl2 \\\\+ C2R2 \\\\+ Mg ‚Üí Cp2Ti(C2R2) + MgCl2 Structure and Bonding Structures of various metal-alkyne complexes. The coordination of alkynes to transition metals is similar to that of alkenes. The bonding is described by the Dewar‚ÄìChatt‚ÄìDuncanson model. Upon complexation the C-C bond elogates and the alkynyl carbon bends away from 180¬∫. For example, in the phenylpropyne complex Pt(PPh3)2(C2)Ph(Me), the C-C distance is 1.277(25) vs 1.20 √Ö for a typical alkyne. The C-C-C angle distorts 40¬∞ from linearity.William Davies, B.; C. Payne, N., \\"Studies on metal-acetylene complexes: V. Crystal and molecular structure of bis(triphenylphosphine)(1-phenylpropyne)platinum(0), [P(C6H5)3]2(C6H5CCCH3)Pt0\\" J. Organomet. Chem. 1975, volume 99, pp. 315. Because the bending induced by complexation, strained alkynes such as cycloheptyne and cyclooctyne are stabilized by complexation. In the IR spectra, the C-C vibration of alkynes, which occurs near 2300 cm‚àí1, shifts upon complexation to around 1800 cm‚àí1, indicating a weakening of the C-C bond. =Œ∑2-coordination to a single metal center= When bonded side-on to a single metal atom, an alkyne serves as a dihapto usually two-electron donor. For early metal complexes, e.g., Cp2Ti(C2R2), strong œÄ-backbonding into one of the œÄ* antibonding orbitals of the alkyne is indicated. This complex is described as a metallacyclopropene derivative of Ti(IV). For late transition metal complexes, e.g., Pt(PPh3)2(MeC2Ph), the œÄ-backbonding is less prominent, and the complex is assigned oxidation state (0).Hill, A.F. Organotransition Metal Chemistry, 2002, Royal Society of Chemistry, .Crabtree, R. H. Comprehensive Organometallic Chemistry V, 2009, John Wiley & Sons In some complexes, the alkyne is classified as a four-electron donor. In these cases, both pairs of pi-electrons donate to the metal. This kind of bonding was first implicated in complexes of the type W(CO)(R2C2)3.Joseph L. Templeton \\"Four-Electron Alkyne Ligands in Molybdenum(II) and Tungsten(II) Complexes\\" Advances in Organometallic Chemistry 1989, Volume 29, Pages 1‚Äì100. =Œ∑2, Œ∑2-coordination bridging two metal centers= Because alkynes have two œÄ bonds, alkynes can form stable complexes in which they bridge two metal centers. The alkyne donates a total of four electrons, with two electrons donated to each of the metals. And example of a complex with this bonding scheme is Œ∑2-diphenylacetylene-(hexacarbonyl)dicobalt(0). =Benzyne complexes= Transition metal benzyne complexes represent a special case of alkyne complexes since the free benzynes are not stable in the absence of the metal.William M. Jones, Jerzy Klosin \\"Transition-Metal Complexes of Arynes, Strained Cyclic Alkynes, and Strained Cyclic Cumulenes\\" Advances in Organometallic Chemistry 1998, Volume 42, Pages 147‚Äì221. Applications Metal alkyne complexes are intermediates in the semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes: :C2R2 \\\\+ H2 ‚Üí cis-C2R2H2 This transformation is conducted on a large scale in refineries, which unintentionally produce acetylene during the production of ethylene. It is also useful in the preparation of fine chemicals. Semihydrogenation affords cis alkenes. Metal-alkyne complexes are also intermediates in the metal-catalyzed trimerization and tetramerizations. Cyclooctatetraene is produced from acetylene via the intermediacy of metal alkyne complexes. Variant of this reaction are exploited for the synthesis of substituted pyridines. The Pauson‚ÄìKhand reaction provides a route to cyclopentenones via the intermediacy of cobalt-alkyne complexes.

Bonding The bonding between alkenes and transition metals is described by the Dewar‚ÄìChatt‚ÄìDuncanson model, which involves donation of electrons in the pi-orbital on the alkene to empty orbitals on the metal. This interaction is reinforced by back bonding that entails sharing of electrons in other metal orbitals into the otherwise empty pi-antibonding level on the alkene. Early metals of low oxidation state (Ti(II), Zr(II), Nb(III) etc.) are strong pi donors, and their alkene complexes are often described as metallacyclopropanes. Treatment of such species with acids gives the alkanes. Late metals (Ir(I), Pt(II)), which are poorer pi-donors, tend to engage the alkene as a Lewis acid‚ÄìLewis base interaction. File:DCDmodel.pngOrbital interactions in a metal-ethylene complex, as described by the Dewar‚ÄìChatt‚ÄìDuncanson model File:M-C2H4.pngTwo extremes depictions of M--- C2H4 interactions. =Rotational barrier= The barrier for the rotation of the alkene about the M-centroid vector is a measure of the strength of the M-alkene pi-bond. Low symmetry complexes of ethylene, e.g. CpRh(C2H4)2, are suitable for analysis of the rotational barriers associated with the metal- ethylene bond. In Zeise's anion ([PtCl3(C2H4)]‚àí) this rotational barrier cannot be assessed by NMR spectroscopy because all four protons are equivalent. Reactions Alkene ligands lose much of their unsaturated character upon complexation. Most famously, the alkene ligand undergoes migratory insertion, wherein it is attacked intramolecularly by alkyl and hydride ligands to form new alkyl complexes. Cationic alkene complexes are susceptible to attack by nucleophiles. =Catalysis= Metal alkene complexes are intermediates in many or most transition metal catalyzed reactions of alkenes: polymerization., hydrogenation, hydroformylation, and many other reactions. The mechanism of the Wacker process involves Pd-alkene complex intermediates. Natural occurrence Metal-alkene complexes are uncommon in nature, with one exception. Ethylene affects the ripening of fruit and flowers by complexation to a Cu(I) center in a transcription factor.Jose M. Alonso, Anna N.

He develops into a temperamental and disturbed man, forcing his Indian wife, Roshni to divorce him and move out of their home with their daughter. Varun then gets into a complicated rebound relationship with a local news reporter, Kate. After gaining American citizenship, Roshni gets a job at a newly outsourced Indian company based in Atlanta called InfoTech. She soon discovers that the company's young but successful director is her childhood friend, Krish Hebbar. The two start seeing each other outside the office, much to Varun's dismay since he still has feelings for his ex-wife. Things take a turn for the worse when several Indian-born young men working for outsourced companies have been found murdered by a professional serial killer. The only link is that all the murder victims knew Krish. Varun brings him in for questioning but does not have enough evidence to arrest him. At around the same time, Krish's true colours are revealed when he blackmails his boss into giving him a promotion. On the dinner date night Roshni comes across a few pictures of the girl whom Krish had forced to go into the cabin of his boss. Seeing this Roshni confronts Krish and tells him that she does not hold any trust on him anymore. Krish tries explaining but couldn't and his plan to propose her remains unfulfilled. After more investigation, Varun learns that the real murderer is a former soldier who was fired from several jobs who were then taken by Indian immigrants. The soldier comes for Krish, who took over his job several years ago. He is finally saved by Varun. In the end, Krish marries Roshni and they move back to India to work for the Indian branch of their company to be closer to family.

As it stands now, the bill moved to the Senate after passing in the house 59‚Äì50 along party lines. Michigan's Speaker of the House, Republican Jase Bolger, has argued that the proposed measure is intended to cover issues such as a conservative Christian baker refusing to allow same-sex couples as customers and an Orthodox Jewish family refusing an autopsy on a family member that had died. Thus, those people could cite the act for support if it is enacted into law. The measure has received opposition from organizations such as the Michigan Civil Rights Commission. Groups stating their support include the Michigan Catholic Conference. In general, the proposal has created an acrimonious partisan debate and also triggered multiple discussions by lawmakers in the state. Background Michigan law currently prohibits discrimination due to religious beliefs against individuals in respect to some categories such as age and race. For instance, it is currently illegal for a landlord to refuse to house Jewish tenants due to the landlord's conservative Christian beliefs. The Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act, written and passed in 1976, was a landmark law in this regard in Michigan political history. Its name comes from the fact that lawmakers Daisy Elliott and Melvin L. Larsen introduced and spearheaded the act. An amendment offered by Democrats would have required the proposal to state clearly that it would not interfere with the protections offered by Michigan's past civil rights acts. That, along with other amendments, failed. Varying opinions exist as to if the proposal would give an out to those anti-discrimination laws. However, no statewide protections for LGBT people in analogous circumstances exist, so discrimination against those individuals have frequently happened with no legal repercussions. Thus, the proposal would essentially ratify the circumstances already in place, shielding individuals wishing to discriminate from possible future measures. Debates The proposal has generally resulted in an acrimonious partisan debate over its merits as well as the motivations for its creation, with many discussions by lawmakers in the state. As stated before, several organizations such as the Michigan Civil Rights Commission have viewed the proposal as a setback to the cause of expanding civil rights. Groups stating their support include the Michigan Catholic Conference, the organizations arguing that the ability to discriminate can come from deeply held moral viewpoints that should be respected.

W. 1996. Niebla and Vermilacinia (Ramalinaceae) from California and Baja California. Sida The epithet is in honor of Reginald Heber Howe, Jr. for his contributions to lichenology, especially acknowledged for providing images of the type (biology) specimens in his revision of the genus Ramalina. Distinguishing Features Vermilacinia howei is classified in the subgenus Cylindricaria in which it is distinguished from related species by the thallus divided into tubular slightly inflated branches. The species is also one of two in the genus‚Äîwithin North America‚Äîthat lacks the diterpene, a diagnostic character trait that easily separates the species from most others in the genus. The triterpene zeorin, which is also common in the genus, is usually present in trace amounts, while other lichen substances are not evident from thin-layer chromatography (plates). Mature apothecia are usually present, in contrast to rarely being fully developed in V. cerebra. Vermilacinia howei is similar to V. leopardina in possessing black bands, or large irregularly shaped black spots, on the branches, and in addition to differing by the absence of (-)-16-hydroxykaurane, it further differs by the relatively smaller thallus, the branches not more than 3 cm long. The type (biology) has short cylindrical branches that appear to have been inflated such as might occur by taking in moisture from fog and then deflated upon drying out. Another distinction is its dark green cortex and relatively large tea-cup shaped apothecia in proportion to the size of the branches. However, other thalli of the species are recognized to have uniformly slender branches that occasionally differ in containing zeorin in higher concentrations, but they still lack the diterpene (-)-16-hydroxykaurane. Vermilacinia howei occurs most frequently on the Vizca√≠no Peninsula between Punta Eugenia and Bah√≠a Tortugas, generally further inland from the ocean than V. nylanderi. These two species have a reverse morphology and chemistry relationship to that of V. leopardina and V. corrugata. This may have been the result of past geologic isolation of the Vizca√≠no Peninsula from main peninsula. Taxonomic History Vermilacinia howei was described in 1996, but also perceived to be a synonym (taxonomy) under an extremely broad species and genus concept; one that essentially combines all species of Vermilacinia that grow on trees and shrubs, including two sorediate species, under one species name, Niebla ceruchis,Bowler, P. and J. Marsh. 2004. Niebla. ‚ÄòLichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert' 2: 368‚Äì380 an epithet that is based on a type (biology) specimen for a species interpreted to grow on earth in South America, recognized as Vermilacinia ceruchis, one that is also endemic to South America.Spjut R.

Peine, eds., Koeltz Scientific Books: Koenigstein, pp. 337-351. The listing of seven different species names under ‚ÄúNiebla ceruchis‚Äù that includes V. howei, for example as one synonym (biology) of the seven synonyms does not mean that they are equal to N. ceruchis, as sometimes indicated on web sites and in literature,Enlichenment, ‚ÄúNiebla ceruchis‚Äù, three images, Palos Verdes Bluffs, Bluff Cove; top image shows thallus with lobes enlarged terminally, a characteristic feature of Vermilacinia cerebra, the lower two images show yellow green thalli with soralia, characteristic traits of Vermilacinia zebrina; these names are not synonymous as may be envisioned in the Lichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert 2: 372 (2004), while one may also continue to debate whether they represent two different species, or just one species; accessed 6 December 2014; http://www.waysofenlichenment.net/lichens/Niebla%20ceruchis. especially when the listing of synonyms provide no scientific basis for reaching such a conclusion, and when the species already had been substantiated as distinct by their differences in morphology, chemistry, ecology, and geography. The genus Vermilacinia is distinguished from Niebla by the absence of chondroid strands in the medulla,Chondroid strands in the genus Niebla appear as tiny threads or cords running lengthwise in the medulla, interconnected diagonally or crosswise by other freely branched solitary hyphal cells. There are usually many such cords in the Niebla medulla. The medulla of Vermilacinia subgenus Cylindricaria has long flexible hyphal cells united at frequent intervals into knots. They are referred to as fascicles of hyphal cells. There are many such fascicles in a single medulla. It appears that when a thallus takes in moisture, the hyphal cells bend outwards, and as they dry they come together. Medulla hyphae in a herbarium specimen may lose elasticity over time, and all the fascicles may appear as a single cord and by the major lichen substance predominantly of terpenes.

Abramson and Ronald Inglehart that attributes changes in values between young people and their elders to their different circumstances growing up. Because people's formative experiences in pre-adult years tend to shape them throughout later life, if the younger birth cohorts in a given society have experienced fundamentally different conditions than those that shaped older birth cohorts, one will find substantial and persisting differences between the basic values of older and younger generations. As the younger birth cohorts gradually replace the older ones over time, one will observe predictable changes in the values and behaviour of the population of that society as a whole. The main case of generational replacement in Abramson and Inglehart's article, \\"Generational Replacement and Value Change in Eight West European Societies\\", was the shift from materialist to postmaterialist values among the publics of advanced industrial societies. People concerned with \\"maintaining order\\" and \\"fighting rising prices\\" are classified as materialists, while those who choose \\"giving the people more say\\" and \\"freedom of speech\\" are classified as expressing postmaterialism. This shift reflected the fact that the post-war birth cohorts of Western societies had experienced unprecedented prosperity, the post-war welfare states, and the absence of war that prevailed after 1945, while the older cohorts had been shaped by the economic and physical insecurity linked with the First World War, the Great Depression, and the Second World War.

Wade MacLauchlan CM OPEI (born December 10, 1954), is a Canadian legal academic, university administrator, politician and community leader. He served as the 5th president of the University of Prince Edward Island from 1999 to 2011, becoming President Emeritus in 2012. He served as the 32nd premier of Prince Edward Island from 2015 to 2019. His government was defeated in the April 23, 2019 general election. MacLauchlan announced his intention to step down as Liberal leader on April 26, 2019 and completed his term as Premier on May 9, 2019. Early life, education and career MacLauchlan was born on 10 December 1954, the third of five children of Harry and Marjorie MacLauchlan, living in Stanhope, Prince Edward Island. Stanhope is the oldest Scottish community on PEI, with the first Scottish settlers arriving on the ship ‚ÄúFalmouth‚Äù in June 1770. The MacLauchlan's were early residents of Stanhope, with a large extended family in Stanhope and numerous other rural PEI communities. MacLauchlan was born into an entrepreneurial household. The family lived initially in an apartment above a country general store that his father Harry started at Stanhope in 1946 at the age of nineteen. Harry and Marjorie MacLauchlan were businesspeople involved in tourism, fisheries, heavy construction, and several other ventures through the 1960s. By the age of 10, Wade had two newspaper routes along with his cousin, selling The Guardian in the morning and The Evening Patriot in the afternoon. He would later recall that the only advice offered by his father regarding what was a fairly sizeable business venture for two youngsters was that they should read the newspaper before selling it; ‚ÄúIn other words, the most important thing in business is to know what you‚Äôre talking about.\\" MacLauchlan‚Äôs parents went on to other ventures including MacLauchlan‚Äôs Motel in Charlottetown, expanding the heavy construction business and getting in to cable television, golf courses, oil and gas distribution, and real estate. MacLauchlan worked in many of those ventures with jobs such as weighing and salting fish, collecting garbage, building golf course greens, and carrying suitcases. In the summer of 1974, at the age of 19, he headed further afield, working as a guide on cross- Canada bus tours. After completing his first eight years of education, MacLauchlan went from the two-room school at Stanhope to study at Charlottetown Rural High. Along with his studies, MacLauchlan was involved in student politics as vice-president of Student Council and chair of the organizing committee for the annual Winter Carnival. A key formative experience came when MacLauchlan was nominated by his high school teachers to serve as a page in the PEI provincial legislature for two years in 1970 and 1971 at the height of the Comprehensive Development Plan and Alex Campbell‚Äôs premiership. MacLauchlan went on to earn an undergraduate Bachelor of Business Administration degree from the University of Prince Edward Island, followed by a Bachelor of Laws from the University of New Brunswick and a Master of Laws from Yale University. While at UPEI, he served two terms as an elected student representative on University Senate. Upon graduating in 1976, MacLauchlan was awarded the Owen MacDonald Memorial Award, presented to a graduate by the senior class for excellence and outstanding contribution to the class. At UNB Law School, MacLauchlan held the Beaverbrook Scholarship in Law, was elected to serve for two terms on Law Faculty Council and was awarded the Lieutenant Governor‚Äôs Medal on graduation. MacLauchlan attended Yale Law School with the O‚ÄôBrien Scholarship and Yale Law Scholarship. Following graduation from UPEI, MacLauchlan took a double gap year, working and traveling widely from 1976-78. He worked as road construction labourer in Northern Quebec, as a hotel clerk at Jasper Park Lodge, as a roughneck on an oil rig in west-central Alberta, and as a volunteer recycler in southern France.  Academic Career  In the year following graduation from UNB Law, MacLauchlan was awarded a clerkship at the Supreme Court of Canada, where he was the sole law clerk for Justice W.Z. Estey. 1981-82 was an active year for the Supreme Court, beginning with the delivery in late September of opinions in the famous Patriation Reference.Reference re Resolution to amend the Constitution, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 753. The Court‚Äôs decision led to first ministers meetings that in turn paved the way for patriation of the Canadian constitution, adoption of the Constitution Act, 1982, and enshrinement of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. MacLauchlan began his teaching and academic career as an assistant professor, later promoted to associate professor, at Dalhousie Law School from 1983 to 1991. During this time, he served for six years as Director of the federal government‚Äôs Civil Law-Common Law Exchange Program. MacLauchlan was active in the Canadian Association of Law Teachers, including as Chair of a Special Advisory Committee on Equality in Legal Education, which produced the report Equality in Legal Education: Sharing a Vision, Creating the Pathways.Reprinted in (1992) 17(1) Queen‚Äôs Law Journal 174. His main teaching and scholarly focus was in administrative and public law. From 1990 to 1993, he was the administrative law editor of the Supreme Court Law Review. MacLauchlan was Dean of Law at the University of New Brunswick from 1991 to 1996. As dean, he led the establishment of the $1.5 million Heritage Fund on the occasion of the law school‚Äôs centenary in 1991-92. During this period, UNB‚Äôs law faculty became known as ‚ÄúCanada‚Äôs great small law school,‚Äù a title it retains today. In 1993-94, MacLauchlan was chair of the university-wide faculty-staff component of UNB‚Äôs Venture Campaign, launching what became a successful $40 million initiative. From 1997 to 1999, MacLauchlan served as founding director of UNB‚Äôs multi-disciplinary Centre for Property Studies. UPEI President In 1999, MacLauchlan was appointed as the fifth president of the University of Prince Edward Island, the first PEI native to serve in the role. At the time of his appointment, MacLauchlan said, ‚ÄúWe can be as great as any university in this country. We may not be as big, but we can be as good.‚Äù With declining youth populations, enrolment was identified as a challenge for UPEI and other Atlantic universities. At the outset, MacLauchlan suggested a target of increasing full-time student enrolment to 2700 students (at the time, FT enrolment was 2450.) That target was surpassed within two years; UPEI had more than 2850 full-time students in 2001-02. By 2010-11, enrolment at UPEI grew to just under 4000 full-time students. This reflected increased numbers of students from Prince Edward Island and elsewhere in Canada, in conjunction with a five-fold increase in both international students and students enrolled in graduate programs. During these years, UPEI‚Äôs standing in the annual Maclean‚Äôs University Rankings rose from #18 (of 21) among Primarily Undergraduate universities in 2000 to #5 (of 21) in 2006 and was consistently in the top 10. A second target identified by MacLauchlan when he became UPEI president was to double the amount of funding for research and development (in 1999, external research funding was $2 million annually.) By 2002, external research funding at UPEI increased to $5.2 million. Total annual research funding further increased by more than 150% to $13.2 million between 2002 and 2007, earning UPEI recognition as the top Canadian undergraduate university for research funding growth during the five-year period.Research Infosource, Canada‚Äôs Innovation Leaders 2008 Beginning in 2002, MacLauchlan served as co-chair of a Technology Roadmap Steering Committee that brought together leaders from industry with university scientists, government funding partners and representatives of the federal National Research Council to secure funding approval in 2003 for the establishment of the NRC‚Äôs Institute of NutriSciences and Health on the UPEI campus. Other signal research achievements included the establishment of a number of prestigious Canada Research Chairs (CRCs). By 2008, UPEI had been awarded six CRCs. In 2009 UPEI secured one of only ten inaugural Canada Excellence Research Chairs awarded to universities across Canada, in the relatively new discipline of aquatic epidemiology. Growth the research and development portfolio at UPEI and the Atlantic Veterinary College coincided with expansion of graduate programs in a range of disciplines, with enrolments increasing from 53 graduate students in 1999-2000 to 260 graduate students in 2011-12. Teaching and learning remained a top priority and area of excellence for UPEI. MacLauchlan committed to be in the classroom to teach as many UPEI students as possible. He did so by teaching students in English 101 classes about the importance of writing and by offering guest lectures in other first year and upper year courses. UPEI continued to demonstrate a commitment to teaching and learning through faculty members being recognized with an impressive number of regional and national teaching awards. In 2003, UPEI created the Webster Centre for Teaching and Learning. When MacLauchlan completed his eleven-year term as president in 2011, his service was recognized through the creation of two new series of student awards. Up to sixty MacLauchlan Prizes for Effective Writing are presented annually to UPEI students who excel in coursework writing across the disciplines or in community-oriented writing. The H. Wade MacLauchlan Raised Expectations Awards go to the Grade 12 graduating student from each P.E.I. high school who demonstrates the greatest improvement in academic achievement from Grade 10 to the completion of Grade 12 and who goes on to study at UPEI. MacLauchlan encountered criticism from the Canadian Society for Academic Freedom and Scholarship for a 2006 decision to halt distribution on campus of an edition of the student newspaper, The Cadre, which reprinted controversial cartoons of Muhammad published in a Danish newspaper in September 2005. The UPEI Student Union, the owner of the Cadre, initially supported the newspaper‚Äôs decision to publish the cartoons, but after meetings with MacLauchlan and other student groups, offered an apology to the PEI Muslim community and rounded up the remaining copies of the newspaper. In the fall of 2010, MacLauchlan led vocal opposition to an initiative by the PEI government that proposed to amend the University Act to permit the creation of additional university-status institutions in the province, specifically to permit developer Richard Homburg to create a degree-granting real estate university. The provincial government decided against proceeding with the controversial changes. MacLauchlan‚Äôs presidency was a period of major infrastructure development at UPEI. The first major project was a much-needed new Student Centre located at the front of campus. This was followed by new and refurbished residences, a new school of business, a complex for applied health sciences, a major expansion of the veterinary college, the NRC institute and research complex, a major community- university arena and aquatics facility, new playing fields and a track and field facility for the 2009 Canada Summer Games, and an overall upgrade of campus grounds and facilities in accordance with a first-ever Campus Master Plan. MacLauchlan took pride in saying that these infrastructure improvements were achieved while leaving UPEI with no unfunded debt, reflecting the considerable public and private funding contributions secured under his leadership. MacLauchlan served a number of years as an executive member of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC) and as a member and Chair of AUCC‚Äôs Standing Advisory Committee on International Relations. As UPEI president, MacLauchlan served as a member of the Executive of the Association of Atlantic Universities including twice as Chair of the AAU. He served on the Board of Atlantic University Sport, including five years as Chair. When MacLauchlan was in his eleventh year as UPEI president, he was interviewed by Gordon Pitts of the Globe and Mail on the subject of leadership. MacLauchlan responded to a question from Pitts about the role of universities in economic growth by saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never been more important to do what we do and do more of it ‚Äì in terms of moving to the emerging economy and what will pay the bills in the 21st century.‚Äù In concluding the interview, Pitts asked, ‚ÄúWhat is your legacy?‚Äù MacLauchlan responded, ‚ÄúHigher expectation. It wouldn‚Äôt have been uncommon if you talked to Grade 12 students in PEI 15 years ago, to hear them say, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm just going to UPEI.‚Äô The ‚Äòjust‚Äô is gone now.‚Äù In 2015, when MacLauchlan was interviewed by the national university publication University Affairs about legacies, following a presentation to current university presidents, he had this to say, ‚ÄúI think the overall piece is raised expectations. It‚Äôs not [from] me alone, of course. It comes through a collective effort and you have to get your timing right. By raised expectations I mean for students, professors and the community to see a greater role for the university, to see a greater opportunity to achieve and, ultimately, to be able to measure how others see you.‚Äù  After UPEI & Author  After completing his 12-year term as UPEI‚Äôs longest-serving president, MacLauchlan retired from the University at the end of 2011 and was named President Emeritus. He stayed active in public affairs and debates. In a January 2013 opinion essay in the Charlottetown Guardian entitled ‚ÄúP.E.I. needs immigration and a population strategy,‚Äù MacLauchlan emphasized a sense of urgency, saying ‚ÄúAs things are currently lined up, P.E.I. faces two demographic certainties: there will be fewer of us, and we will be older. These are both barriers to growth.‚Äù Later in the op-ed, MacLauchlan said, ‚ÄúIf P.E.I.‚Äôs history could be summed up in three words, it would be: ‚ÄòGrow or go.‚Äô Without opportunities to grow and prosper, people leave.‚ÄùThe op-ed was a summary of views MacLauchlan expressed in a public talk entitled ‚ÄúDemographics and Destiny: A Challenge for P.E.I.‚Äù at Holland College on January 14, 2013. MacLauchlan became a member of the ‚ÄúConnectors‚Äù Committee of the Greater Charlottetown Chamber of Commerce and served as co-chair of the 2013 Georgetown Conference, held in Georgetown, PEI on October 3-5, 2013 and dedicated to the theme Redefining Rural. The Georgetown Conference was founded by Paul MacNeil, publisher of the Eastern Graphic, and developed under the umbrella of Newspapers Atlantic, a regional association representing 70 predominately rural community newspapers, with a combined weekly circulation of 730,000. The Conference attracted delegates from communities throughout the four Atlantic Provinces and speakers from across Canada, aiming to develop action plans and networks to promote rural revitalization and sustainability of rural communities throughout the region.MacLauchlan presented a paper co- authored with MacNeill at the annual conference of the National Newspapers of America in Phoenix, AZ in September 2013, ‚ÄúThe Georgetown Conference, Rural Redefined Leveraging the collective power of community newspapers to rethink rural Atlantic Canada.‚Äù https://www.nna.org/pub/doc/macneillmaclauchlan.pdf MacLauchlan‚Äôs main activity during the post-UPEI period was to research, write and publish the political biography of Alex B. Campbell, who was PEI‚Äôs longest-serving premier from 1966 to 1978. Alex B. Campbell: The Prince Edward Island Premier Who Rocked the Cradle was released in print edition in May 2014.Prince Edward Island Museum and Heritage Foundation (2014). In researching the book, MacLauchlan conducted more than 70 interviews with political and bureaucratic actors from the period, as well as family and friends of Alex B. Campbell. He spent many hours interviewing Campbell himself and sifted through thousands of archival documents, photographs and public media records. In November 2014, an audio version of the book, recorded primarily by MacLauchlan, with passages from actor Gracie Finley, artistic director Duncan McIntosh and with Alex B. Campbell reading from his speeches and singing.Both the audio book and the e-publication may be downloaded free of charge through the Robertson Library at the University of Prince Edward Island at https://alexbcampbell.ca/ In November 2012, MacLauchlan was elected as a councillor of the rural Municipality of North Shore. He was re-elected by acclamation in November 2014. From 2013 to 2015, MacLauchlan served as a board member of the Federation of Municipalities of Prince Edward Island. From 2008 to 2015, MacLauchlan served as a director of Medavie Inc. and Medavie Health Services. In 2009, he became a director of the Medavie Health Foundation, later serving as chair of the Foundation, which grew to a $50 million fund embracing child and youth mental health and Type-2 diabetes as its two core areas of support. In 2012, MacLauchlan was named a director of the Windsor Foundation, one of the largest and longest-established private foundations in Atlantic Canada. In 2013-14, MacLauchlan led a fundraising initiative that exceeded its $2 million goal and allowed the CHANCES Family Centre to pay off the mortgage on its central facility, named in honour of Hon. Catherine Callbeck. PEI Premier On 13 November 2014, Liberal premier Robert Ghiz unexpectedly announced that he would resign upon the selection of a new Liberal leader. Two weeks later, Wade MacLauchlan was joined at the North Shore Community Centre in his home community by 19 of 23 Liberal caucus members for the announcement that he would be a candidate for the party leadership. He declared, \\"We have challenges: fiscal, economic, demographic, environmental and others,\\" and said that he wanted to lead a government that would square up to those challenges and a province that he offered to serve as ‚Äúoptimist-in-chief.‚Äù He was the sole candidate at the close of nominations on January 20, 2015 and was acclaimed leader on February 21, 2015. In his acceptance speech to the leadership convention, MacLauchlan emphasized economic growth, demographic change, and open government, telling the audience, \\"Prosperity starts with growing our economy.‚Äù MacLauchlan was sworn in as the 32nd Premier of Prince Edward Island, on February 23, 2015. In addition to serving as premier, MacLauchlan assumed the roles of Minister of Finance and Energy, as well as Minister of Intergovernmental, Aboriginal and Francophone Affairs in an eight-member cabinet. Questions of ethics and government accountability that had dogged the Liberal administration of Robert Ghiz became issues for MacLauchlan‚Äôs government from its first weeks in office. The Ghiz government‚Äôs initiative to establish PEI as an e-gaming jurisdiction and efforts to create a financial hub were kept in the limelight by newly selected PC leader Rob Lantz and by investigative journalists. MacLauchlan asked PEI‚Äôs auditor-general to review the matters and introduced conflict-of-interest reforms aimed at improving government transparency and accountability, saying the province needed to restore public confidence and trust. MacLauchlan led the Liberals to a majority in a May 4, 2015 general election, winning 18 of 27 seats in the PEI Legislative Assembly. The Progressive Conservative party increased its standing to 8 seats and the Green party elected its first-ever Island MLA. MacLauchlan was elected as MLA for York-Oyster Bed, a seat previously held by his chief of staff Robert Vessey. The Liberal platform built on the theme ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Work Together‚Äù and around the pillars ‚ÄúPeople, Prosperity, Engagement,‚Äù promising aggressive business development initiatives, as well as a first-ever arts and culture strategy and a population action plan. The new cabinet saw a mix of seasoned and first-time ministers, with MacLauchlan taking on the role of Minister of Justice and Attorney General in the place of the Finance portfolio. The Legislature met for a June sitting, which included the adoption of the 2015-16 provincial budget and tabling of a white paper on democratic renewal. One of the first acts of the new government, prior to the legislative sitting, was to announce that PEI would fund abortions on a self-referral basis through an agreement with Moncton Hospital. This was considered ‚Äúbig news for the Island but a small first step‚Äù by abortion-rights advocates. In March of 2016, the PEI government announced, in response to a constitutional challenge, the creation of a self-referring Women‚Äôs Health Centre that would offer abortions on the Island for the first time in almost forty years, along with a range of reproductive health services. An early challenge for the MacLauchlan government was the need to install new power transmission cables under the Northumberland Strait between New Brunswick and PEI, to expand the capacity of existing 40 year-old cables and address concerns about their age and condition. MacLauchlan described this as the province‚Äôs top infrastructure priority but was unwilling to settle for the maximum funding of $50 million offered by the Harper federal government toward what eventually became a $142.5 million project. After the 2015 federal election, the Trudeau government agreed to share the cost. When the project was completed in August 2017, MacLauchlan said it meant ‚Äúan energy system for Prince Edward Island that is reliable, affordable and increasingly renewable.‚Äù A plebiscite on electoral reform in November 2016 cost the MacLauchlan government political capital, as did a school review conducted in the winter of 2017. On the recommendation of an all-party legislative committee, the electoral reform plebiscite offered Islanders five choices through a preferential voting or ranked-ballot system. After four rounds, the majority of votes (52.4%) were cast in favour of mixed member proportional representation [MMP]. Because participation in the plebiscite was very low by PEI standards at 36.46%, the MacLauchlan government introduced legislation to have the matter settled through a yes-or-no referendum on MMP to be held in conjunction with the 2019 provincial election. While the referendum eventually went against MMP, the process ‚Äúturned what was a dormant issue into a lightning rod of general public frustration.‚Äù In the fall of 2016 and winter of 2017, a periodic review of school zoning and populations by the PEI Public Schools Branch attracted considerable public opposition to the proposed closure of five schools. At the conclusion of the process, the trustees recommended to cabinet that two of the five schools be closed but the government opted to keep the schools open. MacLauchlan said the decision was guided by a ‚Äúlearner-centred‚Äù approach. The PC opposition called the process a ‚Äúsham.‚Äù MacLauchlan responded that the review had resulted in a commitment to the ‚Äúdevelopment and growth of our communities and our population in all parts of this province.‚ÄùHansard, Prince Edward Island Legislative Assembly, 2nd Session, 65th General Assembly, April 4, 2017, p.2530. MacLauchlan‚Äôs two main priorities in government were to expand and diversify the PEI economy and grow and rejuvenate the province‚Äôs population. From 2015 to 2019, PEI led all provinces for economic growth, expanding by a cumulative 16 per cent in real terms over the five yearsStatistics Canada. Table 36-10-0402-02 Gross domestic product (GDP) at basic prices, by industry, provinces and territories, growth rates (x 1,000,000), while the total Canadian economy grew by 9 per cent during the same period. These gains translated into significant growth in employment. From May 2015 to December 2019, PEI saw the creation of 8,500 new full-time jobs, equal to 14.2% of the local labour market.Statistics Canada, Labour Force Survey, Characteristics by Province, December 2019, FT employment PEI 68,200 https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/200110/t003a-eng.htm. Labour Force Survey, Characteristics by Province, May 2015, FT employment PEI 59,700 https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily- quotidien/150605/t150605a003-eng.htm The growth came predominantly in the private sector, with substantial increases in manufacturing, construction, agriculture, fisheries, tourism, transportation and wholesale trade. The economic and job growth came with increased population. For each year from 2015-16 through 2018-19, PEI led all provinces for rates of growth for population and immigration. PEI‚Äôs population grew by 9 per cent from 144,546 in 2015 to 156,947 in 2019. For the first time since 1968, the median age of Prince Edward Islanders declined. After watching its median age increase without exception from 1969 to 2016, rising from 25 to 44, PEI became the only Canadian province to see its median age decrease for three consecutive years, dropping to 43.2 in 2019.Statistics Canada. Table 17-10-0005-01 Population estimates on July 1st, by age and sex PEI‚Äôs population growth and rejuvenation brought with it an increased demand for housing. In the fall of 2013, PEI‚Äôs rental vacancy rate was 7.1%. By the end of 2018, PEI had the lowest rental vacancy rate in Canada, at 0.2%, causing many to refer to the situation as a housing crisis. In March 2018, the MacLauchlan government released a five-year Housing Action Plan, developed in conjunction with a provincial Housing Supply Task Force appointed in late 2017.The Action Plan committed to a range of programs and partnerships, including investments in new affordable housing for the first time since the early 1990s and a tripling of income-sensitive rent supplements. In 2019, a record number of new residential units were constructed, and the provincial rental vacancy rate rose to 1.2%. Some of the major initiatives of the MacLauchlan government included passage of PEI‚Äôs first-ever Water Act, which some commentators said could be a model for the rest of the country, and a new Municipal Government Act replacing legislation first adopted in 1947. A new Business Corporations Act and registry replaced a Companies Act with origins in the 1880s. The province undertook its first comprehensive review of policing in decades, and a new Education Act replaced legislation from the early 1970s. In the area of open government, Prince Edward Island adopted its first-ever whistle-blower protection legislation, a lobbyist registry and the modernization of limits on political contributions. Energy and climate change were prominent issues during MacLauchlan‚Äôs time as premier, starting with meetings of Canada‚Äôs premiers in the summer of 2015 that finalized the Canadian Energy Strategy. A November 2015 meeting of first ministers, the first in seven years, was a prelude to participation in the December 2015 conference that produced the Paris Agreement among 196 state parties. First ministers meetings in Vancouver in March 2016 and Ottawa in December moved toward the Pan Canadian Agreement on Clean Energy and Climate Change. Building on an extensive research and consultation, PEI released a ten-year Provincial Energy Strategy in March 2016, and a 32-point Climate Change Action Plan in May 2018. The MacLauchlan government introduced extensive programs and incentives aimed at achieving greater energy efficiency. PEI was one of only three provinces to achieve reduced GHG emissions from 2017 to 2018, with a 1.5 per cent decline in emissions, despite a 2.1 per cent increase in population and a 2.8 per cent increase in economic growth over 2017. When he became Liberal party leader and during the 2015 election campaign, Wade MacLauchlan made a commitment to lead a government would ‚Äúlive within its means.‚Äù After running a $13 million deficit in 2015-16, PEI had balanced budgets that turned into historic surpluses of $75 million in 2017-18 and $57 million in 2018-19. Over a four-year period, there were investments totalling $750 million by all levels of government in public infrastructure in Prince Edward Island. The province‚Äôs share of these capital investments was financed without increasing the provincial net debt and while reducing the province‚Äôs debt-to-GDP ratio from 36.7% in 2015 to 30.5% in 2019, leaving PEI with the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio of any province east of Saskatchewan. In August 2020, the bond rating agency DBRS upgraded PEI‚Äôs credit rating for the first time in two decades. These results were achieved while annual budgets extended tax relief measures and increased program funding, with the significant majority of new expenditure going toward enhanced social programs, education and health care. MacLauchlan‚Äôs Liberals trailed in the polls going in to the 2019 provincial election. The environment was uncertain with the recent selection of Dennis King as Progressive Conservative leader in February 2019 and the suspension of campaigning during the final weekend as a result of the tragic death of Green party candidate Josh Underhay. The theme of the MacLauchlan Liberals‚Äô platform was, ‚ÄúPEI is Working; Let‚Äôs Keep Working.‚Äù With slightly less than normal voter turnout for PEI at under 80%, the election resulted in PEI‚Äôs first minority government in more than a century. The Progressive Conservatives captured 12 seats (later 13, with the results of the deferred election) and 37% of the vote, the Greens 8 seats and 31%, and the Liberals 6 seats and 30%. MacLauchlan lost by 104 votes in his district of Stanhope-Marshfield and announced two days later that he would step down as Liberal party leader upon selection of an interim leader.  Personal life, Community involvement, Honours and awards  Wade MacLauchlan was the first openly gay Premier of Prince Edward Island, and the first openly gay man to be premier of a province. He lives with his partner, theatrical director and entrepreneur Duncan McIntosh, in West Covehead, PEI, the neighbouring community to his native Stanhope. MacLauchlan was the first person in Canada to be a member of the Order of Canada prior to leading a government, having been inducted as a member of Order in 2008. In 2014, he was named to the Order of Prince Edward Island. In 2010, he received the Lieutenant Governor‚Äôs Institute of Public Administration of Canada Award for Excellence in Public Administration. In 2013, MacLauchlan was an inaugural recipient of the Frank McKenna Award for outstanding contributions to public policy by Atlantic Canadians conferred by the Public Policy Forum of Canada. He is the first person to have become a Member of the Order of Canada prior to becoming a provincial premier. MacLauchlan has served on various national and regional organizations. He served as Vice-President of the Canadian Institute for the Administration of Justice; as an executive member of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC) and Chair of AUCC‚Äôs Standing Advisory Committee on International Relations; as board member of the Public Policy Forum of Canada; as board member of the Atlantic Provinces Economic Council (APEC); as a member of the Atlantic Gateway Advisory Council; as executive member and Chair of the Association of Atlantic Universities (AAU); and, as board member and Chair of Atlantic University Sport (AUS). While premier, MacLauchlan served as Chair of the Council of the Federation in 2015 and Chair of the New England Governors and Eastern Canadian Premiers in 2017. MacLauchlan chaired the founding committee of the Palmer Conference on Public Sector Leadership and was actively involved, including as Chair, with the first three Palmer Conferences: Public Servants and their Relationships with Politicians and the Media (2010), Developing a Canadian Energy Strategy (2011), and Canadian Immigration Law and Policy (2012). Prior to getting into political life, MacLauchlan was a board member of the Windsor Foundation and as an inaugural director and later Chair of the Medavie Health Foundation, which identified child and youth mental health and Type-2 diabetes as priority areas for support. While at UNB, MacLauchlan was a founding director of the Muriel McQueen Fergusson Foundation for Eliminating Family Violence and chaired the Committee for the . 150th Anniversary of the Law Society of New Brunswick. While at Dalhousie, he served on the board of the Dalhousie Legal Aid Clinic and was a founding member of the Nova Scotia chapter of Lawyers for Social Responsibility. MacLauchlan has been involved in various business endeavours, including family businesses and as an investor in several start-up technology firms based on PEI. He is a director of Anne in China Inc., which translated Anne of Green Gables into Mandarin and published it in China in 2011. The book was shortlisted by the country‚Äôs national publishers‚Äô association as one of the most influential novels published in China in 2012. He is director and president of a local land development company, Covehead Development Inc.

It has affinity for the Œ∫-opioid receptor (Ki = 300 nM) and the nociceptin receptor (Ki = 18 ŒºM), but not for the Œº- or Œ¥-opioid receptors. Whether N3G acts as an agonist or antagonist of each of the former two respective sites has yet to be determined. In animals, N3G has been found to produce sedation, decreased locomotion, and a small amount of antinociception, properties which are consistent with the effects of Œ∫-opioid receptor agonists. In addition, N3G has been found to reduce tidal volume but not respiratory rate. Unlike norbuprenorphine, but similarly to buprenorphine and buprenorphine-3-glucuronide, N3G is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein. However, due to its highly hydrophilic nature, N3G nonetheless passes the blood-brain-barrier in only very small amounts.
