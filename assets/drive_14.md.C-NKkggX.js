It is the fourth full-length novel to feature the fictional novelist Nathan Zuckerman. When The Counterlife was published, Zuckerman had most recently appeared in a novella called The Prague Orgy, the epilogue to the omnibus volume Zuckerman Bound. Plot summary The novel is divided into five parts, each of which presents a variation on the same basic situation. Parts I and IV are independent of any other part in the novel, whereas Parts II, III, and V form a more or less continuous narrative. Part I, \\"Basel,\\" opens with what appears to be an excerpt from the diary of Jewish novelist Nathan Zuckerman. Nathan talks about his brother, Henry Zuckerman, a suburban dentist who had been having an affair with his assistant Wendy. Henry, however, has developed a serious heart condition, and the medicine has made him impotent. The only alternative to the medication is a potentially life-threatening operation. Henry, unwilling to surrender the possibility of sex, turns to his estranged brother for advice. Nathan tries to dissuade Henry from doing the operation, and tells him that he will eventually adjust, but Henry only becomes increasingly desperate with time. At this point the narration shifts into the third person, revealing that this \\"diary entry\\" was in actuality the eulogy that Nathan had planned to give at Henry's funeral: the operation had killed him. Nathan decides not to give the eulogy, however, concluding that it would merely embarrass his brother's family. At the funeral, Henry's wife Carol delivers the eulogy instead, in which she attributes the operation to Henry's love for her. Nathan is skeptical of her sincerity and wonders how much she knew of her husband's multiple affairs. He also pities his brother, whom he characterizes as a man so desperate to escape his middle-class existence that he preferred death to its stifling stability. Part II, \\"Judea,\\" resets the narrative of the novel thus far: in this section, Henry has survived the operation to fix his heart condition and restore sexual function. Yet rather than resume his previous life, Henry has chosen to abscond to Israel and live in a West Bank settlement. Nathan is sent to Israel by Carol to persuade Henry to return to his family. In Israel, Nathan meets with a variety of Jews who share their diverse perspectives with him, including a crazed fan named Jimmy who accosts him at the Wailing Wall. Nathan then confronts Henry at his settlement, where Henry and the settlers castigate him for betraying his fellow Jews. Nathan meets the settlement's charismatic leader, who delivers a rabid soliloquy about the importance of settling Judea and Samaria. Nathan later confronts Henry and suggests that the settlement leader reminds him of their father, and this might account for part of his influence on Henry. Henry responds angrily that what really matters is not whether or not the leader is a father-figure, but who controls Judea. Unable to talk sense into Henry, Nathan is forced to return home without his brother. Part III, \\"Aloft,\\" continues the \\"counterlife\\" begun in Part II. Nathan is flying back to the United States when he again encounters Jimmy. Jimmy reveals that he has smuggled a gun and a grenade onto the plane. He intends to send a message about Jews no longer being beholden to their traumatic history, and asks Nathan to assist him. Shortly thereafter, security officials attack and arrest Jimmy and Nathan, whom they accuse of colluding with him. Nathan feels humiliated both by the interrogation and by the fact that the security officials have seemingly never heard of him. Part IV, \\"Gloucestershire,\\" represents the third discrete 'counterlife' in the novel. In this section, Nathan is the impotent brother with a heart condition. He and Henry have also remained estranged; Henry has never had an affair with Wendy. Nathan initially cooperates well with the medication, but he soon finds himself tempted by Maria, an English expatriate who lives upstairs with her daughter and diplomat husband. They begin to have an affair and Nathan considers having the operation. Maria urges him not to take such an enormous risk for her, but Nathan decides to do it anyway. He explains that it would allow him to fulfill his greatest desire—to settle down as a family man, by marrying Maria, adopting her daughter, and moving to the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, the operation fails and Nathan dies. The section then shifts focus to Henry Zuckerman. Despite his misgivings, Henry takes the day off work and attends Nathan's funeral. He is deeply offended by the eulogy, in which an editor praises Nathan's controversial novel Carnovsky. Henry has previously accused the novel of humiliating the entire Zuckerman family: indeed, its publication was the cause of their estrangement. After leaving the funeral, Henry decides to inspect Nathan's apartment for anything that could embarrass him. He bribes his way in and quickly finds diary records that reveal a decade-old affair. Henry destroys the diary records, but he soon discovers the second draft of Nathan's last novel. This draft apparently contains Parts I, II, III, and V of the novel and Henry reacts to it with anger. Henry feels that Nathan has projected his insecurities onto him to alleviate his self-loathing. He thereafter destroys Parts I, II, and III, leaving behind Part V only because it does not mention him at length. Part IV concludes by focusing on Maria herself. Maria is apparently discussing the recent death of Nathan with her therapist. She relates how she searched Nathan's apartment after his death and found the draft of his unfinished novel (which, due to Henry's intervention, now contains only Part V). She objects that Nathan exaggerated her family in it, inventing character flaws to make them more interesting and serve his own purposes. Maria also confesses that Nathan's portrait of her isn't like her at all, but is instead what Nathan must have wanted her or thought her to be. Nonetheless, she has decided to let the draft be published because she views it as a final expression of Nathan's love for her. As Part IV concludes, it is gradually revealed that Maria's interviewer is not a therapist; he is in fact a ghostly projection of Nathan himself. Maria bids good-bye to Nathan one last time. Part V, \\"Christendom,\\" returns to the narrative of Parts II and III. It delves into the married life of Nathan and Maria, which was briefly alluded to in the novel's previous sections. Just as Nathan wanted in Part IV, they have moved back to England and are temporarily staying with Maria's mother, a staid older woman who is \\"politely\\" anti-Semitic and subtly resents Nathan's relationship with her daughter. When Maria's sister confronts Nathan about marrying the younger and non-Jewish Maria, he begins to feel anxious about their marriage's future. These anxieties then break to the surface after the couple experience anti-Jewish prejudice at an English restaurant. Nathan afterward complains to Maria of her family and England's intolerance. Maria becomes irritable and accuses Nathan of being oversensitive. She leaves him to head back to their home. The novel ends with Nathan and Maria breaking up, which Nathan depicts through an exchange of letters. Maria writes the first letter, explaining that she is walking out both on Nathan's marriage and Nathan's book. She objects to being yet another of his literary characters, complaining that the book's Maria is nothing like her real self—the real Maria, for example, would not express her feelings at such length in a letter. She also faults Nathan for giving their marriage an unhappy ending, pointing out that he had the ability to ensure that everything turned out well for them. Nathan's response apologizes to Maria, but he also holds his ground. He explains to Maria that there is ultimately \\"no you\\" just as there is \\"no me.\\" He claims they are merely the sum of the performances—the counterlives—that they invent for themselves and for others. Nathan reflects upon Jewish circumcision—which he would have forced upon his son—arguing that the pain of the ritual symbolizes the unfairness and cruelty the child will encounter in the world. Nathan ends the book by mourning the dissolution of his and Maria's relationship, because it is only in the pages of this novel he has written that they will ever have lived together in love. Style The five sections of the novel each contradict each other to some extent, so certain events that have taken place in one section are presupposed not to have taken place in subsequent sections. On one level, this can be read as a comment on the craft of writing. It reflects the way in which the author has many germs of ideas, not all of which reach the complete fruition of becoming a coherent work of fiction. At a deeper level, it reflects the fragmentation of human lives. To an extent, all of us live counterlives, as we do things that do not fit in with the 'official story' of the kind of person we are, and the kind of life we are living.

In 2007, Cooper wrote about the events resulting from the publication of her story \\"The Tragi-farce of Scientology\\" in a 1969 issue of Queen magazine. In the article \\"The Scandal of the Scandal of Scientology,\\" in Byline, Cooper commented on her motivation for writing the book: \\"I had a master's degree in psychology and had studied comparative religion at Harvard for a summer and what I learned during my research about the group founded by L. Ron Hubbard was both fascinating and frightening. The story cried out to be told.\\" About 50,000 copies of the book were printed. Operation Freakout The book earned Cooper negative attention from members of the Church, and she was subsequently the target not only of litigation but a harassment campaign known as Operation Freakout, the goal of which was to deter Cooper from criticism of Scientology by having her \\"incarcerated in a mental institution or jail or at least to hit her so hard that she drops her attacks\\". Members of the church sent itself forged bomb threats, purportedly from Cooper, using her typewriter and paper with her fingerprints on it; further plans included bomb threats to be sent to Henry Kissinger. The Church's campaign was discovered when the FBI raided Scientology offices in 1977 and recovered documents relating to the operation. In June 2007 Paulette Cooper wrote about her experience with the Church of Scientology and Operation Freakout from \\"beginning to end\\" for the first time. Another account of Cooper's testimony can be found in Bent Corydon's L. Ron Hubbard: Messiah or Madman? in part 1, chapter 14: \\"Freaking Out Paulette: A Six Year Operation to Drive a Journalist Insane.\\" Attempts to remove book from libraries =Canada= The Church of Scientology of Canada attempted to suppress the book in libraries in Canada. In June 1974, libraries were advised that if they do not remove the books Scientology: The Now Religion, Inside Scientology, The Scandal of Scientology and The Mind Benders from their shelves, they would be named in a lawsuit.Libraries Face Libel Threat, Winnipeg Free Press, 27 June 1974 Two different library boards in Ontario, Canada had been served with writs. After obtaining out-of-court settlements of US$7,500 and US$500 and apologies from the publishers of two of the works (Dell Publishing and Tower Publications), Scientology further threatened to sue any library or bookstore that carried them.Anti-Scientology Books Targets of Lawsuits, The Library Journal, November 1, 1974. After certain libraries in Canada refused to remove the books from their shelves, they were sued by Scientology. One Canadian library reported the theft of a book critical of Scientology from its shelves. These incidents were later reported in a chronological timeline of censorship in British Columbia. =United States= According to Tony Ortega's 2015 biography of Paulette Cooper, The Unbreakable Miss Lovely, libraries in the United States also experienced thefts of the book. Cooper herself learned from the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue that all 50 copies stocked there had been stolen within hours. One Los Angeles library, frustrated by theft attempts, kept the book locked away, and patrons could read it only under supervision.  Reception, use in other works  The Los Angeles Times described Cooper's work as a \\"scathing\\" look at Scientology. The Charleston Gazette called the book: \\"a fascinating, 220-page paperback expose.\\" The book was used as a reference in Jon Atack's later work, A Piece of Blue Sky.A Piece of Blue Sky, Jon Atack, Bibliography, References Summary , Chapter One. Atack wrote: \\"I happened upon the hard-to-find Scandal of Scientology by Paulette Cooper. Now I was fascinated, and started collecting everything I could get my eager hands on — magazine articles, newspaper clippings, government files, anything.\\" Later, when A Piece of Blue Sky was dropped from Amazon.com listings in a controversial move, this was compared to court actions that initially limited distribution of The Scandal of Scientology.

Ziriax, 670 F.3d 1111 (10th Cir. 2012): The court (per Judge Matheson, joined by Judges O’Brien and McKay) upheld a district court’s grant of a preliminary injunction to prevent the Oklahoma State Election Board from certifying a proposed amendment to the Oklahoma Constitution that would prevent Oklahoma state courts from using or considering Sharia law. Bandimere v. SEC, 844 F.3d 1168 (10th Cir. 2016): The court (per Judge Matheson, joined by Judge Briscoe, with Judge McKay dissenting) held that the Securities and Exchange Commission’s administrative-law judges were “inferior officers” subject to the Appointments Clause. The court’s decision opened a circuit split with the D.C. Circuit. Raymond J. Lucia Cos. v. SEC, 832 F.3d 277 (D.C. Cir. 2016), rehearing denied, 868 F.3d 1021, rev’d, 138 S. Ct. 2044 (2018). The Supreme Court granted certiorari on Lucia and agreed with the Tenth Circuit’s holding that the Securities and Exchange Commission’s administrative-law judges were “inferior officers.” Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, 723 F.3d 1114 (10th Cir. 2013) (en banc), aff’d, 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014): Judge Matheson filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part from the en banc majority’s decision that reversed the district court’s denial of a motion for a preliminary injunction in a challenge to a federal regulation that required employers to provide health insurance for employees that covered certain contraceptives. Little Sisters of the Poor v. Burwell, 794 F.3d 1151 (10th Cir. 2015), vacated and remanded, 136 S. Ct. 1557: A group of nonprofit religious employers challenged regulations by the Department of Health and Human Services that provided accommodations for religious objectors to a regulatory mandate to provide employees with health insurance coverage for contraceptives. Hearing appeals from the District of Colorado and Western District of Oklahoma, the Tenth Circuit (per Judge Matheson) held that preliminary injunctive relief was not warranted, concluding that the religious accommodation scheme established by the regulations relieved the plaintiffs of the contraceptive mandate, did not burden religious exercise in violation of RFRA, and did not infringe on First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on the Tenth Circuit’s decision along with decisions from the Third, Fifth, and District of Columbia Circuits. On certiorari, the Supreme Court did not reach the merits. Rather, the Court vacated and remanded on narrow grounds, ordering the lower courts to examine a new argument that arose in supplemental briefing before the Court. Murphy v. Royal, 866 F.3d 1164 (10th Cir. 2017), amended and superseded on denial of rehearing en banc, 875 F.3d 896 (10th Cir. 2017), cert. granted, 138 S. Ct. 2026 (2018): Patrick Dwayne Murphy, a prisoner convicted by an Oklahoma state court, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in a federal district court. The Tenth Circuit (per Judge Matheson, joined by Chief Judge Tymkovich and Judge Phillips) applied the three-part test for the disestablishment or diminishment of an Indian reservation in Solem v. Bartlett, 465 U.S. 463 (1984), and found that Congress had not disestablished the Creek Reservation, which covered about half of modern-day Oklahoma and most of the city of Tulsa. As Murphy was an Indian charged with a crime that occurred in the Creek Reservation, the Oklahoma state court lacked jurisdiction over his charges. In the Tenth Circuit’s order denying rehearing en banc, Chief Judge Tymkovich wrote a concurrence that urged the Supreme Court to take certiorari and reconsider the three-part test in Solem. The Supreme Court granted certiorari.

In his youth was famed as one of the Seven Spears of Shizugatake, during the battle in May 1583. Biography Katsumoto hailed from an ancient samurai clan with a long and distinguished history. In the early Middle Ages, Clan Katagiri served the Minamoto family, traditional head of the samurai that supplied early shōguns and their government, and ruled the southernmost part of Shinano region for nearly 500 years. Despite his lineage and the promising start at Shizugatake, Katsumoto's rise under Toyotomi Hideyoshi was relatively slow compared to his fellow \\"seven spears\\", which included Katō Kiyomasa and Fukushima Masanori. Katō and Fukushima were more court samurai rather than warriors; Katsumoto was kept in the Osaka region, the de facto capital of Japan under the Toyotomi family, and his holdings were in Ibaraki area in the north. (Marked in present-day by a small bronze statue). After the Battle of Sekigahara (1600) which followed Hideyoshi's death, Katsumoto was appointed the chamberlain of the Toyotomi household whose fortune, with infant Hideyori, only son of Hideyoshi, as the head of the dynasty, became increasingly precarious before the ambitious Tokugawa Ieyasu. During the next fifteen years, Katsumoto sought to negotiate a compromise between the ruthless Ieyasu, who had already decided to destroy his former master's dynasty once and for all, and the stubborn and haughty Yodo-dono, mother of young Hideyori, who was hopelessly out of touch with the new and current Tokugawa ruler. Increasingly suspicious of Katsumoto's loyalty, Yodo- dono finally banished Katsumoto from Osaka castle which directly resulted in the Siege of Osaka (1614–15) by Ieyasu's 200,000-strong army. The following summer, the Toyotomi family was annihilated and mother and son committed suicide within the burning castle. Katsumoto's precise role in all of this saga is unclear. Katsumoto died only 20 days after the fall of the Osaka castle for unknown reasons, though the rumour of seppuku was rife. Although his own lineage died out later in the seventeenth century, Katsumoto's younger brother and his family maintained Katagiri's name and its standing as a daimyō. The descendants of which were ennobled in 1884 and retained the title of Viscounts until 1946 when the system was abolished. Cultural references Katsumoto's anguish after the fall of the Toyotomi clan was later dramatised in kabuki theatre where Katsumoto cut a tragic figure in Hamlet's mould. In Tsubouchi Shōyō's play Kiri-hitoha, which describes the fall of the house of Toyotomi, Katsumoto, the main character, is a faithful servant with good intentions and keen sense of reality but rendered powerless caught in the whirlwind of dynastic struggle. At the climax of the play, Katsumoto famously deplores that the fate finally caught up with the house of Toyotomi. The play, which may well be the best modern kabuki piece written by arguably the best playwright of modern Japan (published 1894–95, first staged in 1904), made \\"Katagiri Katsumoto\\" a household name and remains one of the best and most popular modern kabuki plays.

The film stars Danny Kaye as a young daydreaming proofreader (later associate editor) for a magazine publishing firm and Virginia Mayo as the girl of his dreams. The film was adapted for the screen by Ken Englund, Everett Freeman, and Philip Rapp, and directed by Norman Z. McLeod. Plot Walter Mitty (Kaye) is an \\"inconsequential guy from Perth Amboy, New Jersey\\". He is henpecked and harassed by everyone in his life including his bossy mother, his overbearing, idea-stealing boss Bruce Pierce, his dimwitted fiancée Gertrude Griswold, Gertrude's obnoxious would-be suitor Tubby Wadsworth, and her loud-mouthed mother, Mrs. Griswold. Walter's escape from their incessant needling is to imagine all sorts of exciting and impossible lives for himself, fueled by the pulp magazines he reads every day as an editor at the Pierce Publishing Company. But his dreams only seem to land him in more trouble. In one scene, while stoking the heating boiler, he dreams what it would be like to be an RAF fighter pilot. He is awakened from this daydream by his mother, who orders him to come to dinner. Believing he is still a British fighter pilot, he salutes, and places a red-hot poker under his arm—only to burn a hole in his suit jacket. Things become much more complicated when he runs into a mysterious woman, Rosalind van Hoorn (Mayo), who just happens to perfectly resemble the girl of his dreams. Rosalind is working with her uncle, Peter van Hoorn, to help secure some Dutch crown jewels hidden from the Nazis during World War II. Caught up in a real-life adventure that seems unbelievable even to him, Walter attempts to hide his double life from his mundane family and friends. Eventually, he acquires the courage to stand up to those who kick him around.

According to Thurber, producer Samuel Goldwyn rejected the Englund and Freeman script in December 1945, and sent Englund to consult with Thurber, who worked with him for ten days. Thurber later complained that at one time the psychiatrist scene contained \\"a bathing girl incident which will haunt me all the days of my life.\\" He was repeatedly consulted by Goldwyn, but his suggestions were largely ignored. In a letter to Life magazine, Thurber expressed his considerable dissatisfaction with the script, even as Goldwyn insisted in another letter that Thurber approved of it. Thurber also mentioned that Goldwyn asked him not to read part of the script, because it was \\"too blood and thirsty.\\" Thurber said that he read the entire script anyway, and was \\"horror and struck\\". In moving away from Thurber's material, Goldwyn instead had the writers customize the film to showcase Kaye's talents, altering the original story so much that Thurber called the film \\"The Public Life of Danny Kaye\\". Goldwyn also briefly changed the film's title to I Wake Up Dreaming in response to a Gallup poll he had commissioned, a title that was actually a word play on the 1941 Steve Fisher novel I Wake Up Screaming (and the 1941 film of the same name). However, Goldwyn soon changed it back to Thurber's title in response to the angry protests of Thurber fans, as reported in a May 1947 article in Collier's Weekly. The film includes many of Kaye's trademark patter-songs and one of his best-remembered dream characters, \\"Anatole of Paris,\\" a fey women's milliner whose inspiration for the ridiculous chapeaux he creates is in actuality his loathing of women. The Anatole character is based on \\"Antoine de Paris,\\" a women's hair-salon professional of the era, known for creating preposterous hairstyles. The lyrics to the song Anatole of Paris were written by Kaye's wife, Sylvia Fine. Reception The Secret Life of Walter Mitty ranks 479th on Empire magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.Empireonline.com Adaptations to other media The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was dramatized as a half-hour radio play on the November 3, 1947 broadcast of The Screen Guild Theater with Kaye and Mayo in their original film roles. Remake Plans to remake The Secret Life of Walter Mitty arose in the early 1990s, with producer Samuel Goldwyn, Jr. considering actor Jim Carrey for the starring role. After development that spanned over two decades, the film finally came to fruition with Ben Stiller as the lead actor and the director. The film was released in the US on December 25, 2013.

That is to say, b is a root of a monic polynomial over A.The above equation is sometimes called an integral equation and b is said to be integrally dependent on A (as opposed to algebraic dependent.) The set of elements of B that are integral over A is called the integral closure of A in B. It is a subring of B containing A. If every element of B is integral over A, then we say that B is integral over A, or equivalently B is an integral extension of A. If A, B are fields, then the notions of \\"integral over\\" and of an \\"integral extension\\" are precisely \\"algebraic over\\" and \\"algebraic extensions\\" in field theory (since the root of any polynomial is the root of a monic polynomial). The case of greatest interest in number theory is that of complex numbers integral over Z (e.g., \\\\sqrt{2} or 1+i); in this context, the integral elements are usually called algebraic integers. The algebraic integers in a finite extension field k of the rationals Q form a subring of k, called the ring of integers of k, a central object of study in algebraic number theory. In this article, the term ring will be understood to mean commutative ring with a multiplicative identity. Examples = Integral closure in algebraic number theory = There are many examples of integral closure which can be found in algebraic number theory since it is fundamental for defining the ring of integers for an algebraic field extension K/\\\\mathbb{Q} (or L/\\\\mathbb{Q}_p).  Integral closure of integers in rationals  Integers are the only elements of Q that are integral over Z. In other words, Z is the integral closure of Z in Q.  Quadratic extensions  The Gaussian integers, are the complex numbers of the form a + b \\\\sqrt{-1}, a, b \\\\in \\\\mathbf{Z}, and are integral over Z. \\\\mathbf{Z}[\\\\sqrt{-1}] is then the integral closure of Z in \\\\mathbf{Q}(\\\\sqrt{-1}). Typically this ring is denoted \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\mathbb{Q}[i]}. The integral closure of Z in \\\\mathbf{Q}(\\\\sqrt{5}) is the ring > \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\mathbb{Q}[\\\\sqrt{5}]} = \\\\mathbb{Z}\\\\left[ \\\\frac{1 + \\\\sqrt{5}}{2} > \\\\right] this example and the previous one are examples of quadratic integers. The integral closure of a quadratic extension \\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{d}) can be found by constructing the minimal polynomial of an arbitrary element a + b \\\\sqrt{d} and finding number-theoretic criterion for the polynomial to have integral coefficients. This analysis can be found in the quadratic extensions article.  Roots of unity  Let ζ be a root of unity. Then the integral closure of Z in the cyclotomic field Q(ζ) is Z[ζ]. This can be found by using the minimal polynomial and using Eisenstein's criterion.  Ring of algebraic integers  The integral closure of Z in the field of complex numbers C, or the algebraic closure \\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{Q}} is called the ring of algebraic integers.  Other  The roots of unity, nilpotent elements and idempotent elements in any ring are integral over Z. = Integral closure in geometry = In geometry, integral closure is closely related with normalization and normal schemes. It is the first step in resolution of singularities since it gives a process for resolving singularities of codimension 1. * For example, the integral closure of \\\\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]/(xy) is the ring \\\\mathbb{C}[x,z] \\\\times \\\\mathbb{C}[y,z] since geometrically, the first ring corresponds to the xz-plane unioned with the yz-plane. They have a codimension 1 singularity along the z-axis where they intersect. *Let a finite group G act on a ring A. Then A is integral over AG the set of elements fixed by G. See ring of invariants. *Let R be a ring and u a unit in a ring containing R. ThenKaplansky, 1.2. Exercise 4. #u−1 is integral over R if and only if u−1 ∈ R[u]. #R[u] \\\\cap R[u^{-1}] is integral over R. #The integral closure of the homogeneous coordinate ring of a normal projective variety X is the ring of sections ::\\\\bigoplus_{n \\\\ge 0} \\\\operatorname{H}^0(X, \\\\mathcal{O}_X(n)). = Integrality in algebra = * If \\\\overline{k} is an algebraic closure of a field k, then \\\\overline{k}[x_1, \\\\dots, x_n] is integral over k[x_1, \\\\dots, x_n]. * The integral closure of Cx in a finite extension of C((x)) is of the form \\\\mathbf{C}x^{1/n} (cf. Puiseux series)  Equivalent definitions  Let B be a ring, and let A be a subring of B. Given an element b in B, the following conditions are equivalent: :(i) b is integral over A; :(ii) the subring A[b] of B generated by A and b is a finitely generated A-module; :(iii) there exists a subring C of B containing A[b] and which is a finitely-generated A-module; :(iv) there exists a faithful A[b]-module M such that M is finitely generated as an A-module. The usual proof of this uses the following variant of the Cayley–Hamilton theorem on determinants: :Theorem Let u be an endomorphism of an A-module M generated by n elements and I an ideal of A such that u(M) \\\\subset IM. Then there is a relation: ::u^n + a_1 u^{n-1} + \\\\cdots + a_{n-1} u + a_n = 0, \\\\, a_i \\\\in I^i. This theorem (with I = A and u multiplication by b) gives (iv) ⇒ (i) and the rest is easy. Coincidentally, Nakayama's lemma is also an immediate consequence of this theorem.  Elementary properties  = Integral closure forms a ring = It follows from the above four equivalent statements that the set of elements of B that are integral over A forms a subring of B containing A. (Proof: If x, y are elements of B that are integral over A, then x + y, xy, -x are integral over A since they stabilize A[x]A[y], which is a finitely generated module over A and is annihilated only by zero.)This proof is due to Dedekind (Milne, ANT). Alternatively, one can use symmetric polynomials to show integral elements form a ring. (loc cit.) This ring is called the integral closure of A in B. = Transitivity of integrality = Another consequence of the above equivalence is that \\"integrality\\" is transitive, in the following sense. Let C be a ring containing B and c \\\\in C. If c is integral over B and B integral over A, then c is integral over A. In particular, if C is itself integral over B and B is integral over A, then C is also integral over A. = Integral closed in fraction field = If A happens to be the integral closure of A in B, then A is said to be integrally closed in B. If B is the total ring of fractions of A, (e.g., the field of fractions when A is an integral domain), then one sometimes drops the qualification \\"in B\\" and simply says \\"integral closure of A\\" and \\"A is integrally closed.\\"Chapter 2 of Huneke and Swanson 2006 For example, the ring of integers \\\\mathcal{O}_K is integrally closed in the field K.  Transitivity of integral closure with integrally closed domains  Let A be an integral domain with the field of fractions K and A' the integral closure of A in an algebraic field extension L of K. Then the field of fractions of A' is L. In particular, A' is an integrally closed domain. = Transitivity in algebraic number theory = This situation is applicable in algebraic number theory when relating the ring of integers and a field extension. In particular, given a field extension L/K the integral closure of \\\\mathcal{O}_K in L is the ring of integers \\\\mathcal{O}_L.  Remarks  Note that transitivity of integrality above implies that if B is integral over A, then B is a union (equivalently an inductive limit) of subrings that are finitely generated A-modules. If A is noetherian, transitivity of integrality can be weakened to the statement: :There exists a finitely generated A-submodule of B that contains A[b]. = Relation with finiteness conditions = Finally, the assumption that A be a subring of B can be modified a bit. If f:A \\\\to B is a ring homomorphism, then one says f is integral if B is integral over f(A). In the same way one says f is finite (B finitely generated A-module) or of finite type (B finitely generated A-algebra). In this viewpoint, one has that :f is finite if and only if f is integral and of finite type. Or more explicitly, :B is a finitely generated A-module if and only if B is generated as an A-algebra by a finite number of elements integral over A.  Integral extensions  = Cohen-Seidenberg theorems = An integral extension A ⊆ B has the going-up property, the lying over property, and the incomparability property (Cohen–Seidenberg theorems). Explicitly, given a chain of prime ideals \\\\mathfrak{p}_1 \\\\subset \\\\cdots \\\\subset \\\\mathfrak{p}_n in A there exists a \\\\mathfrak{p}'_1 \\\\subset \\\\cdots \\\\subset \\\\mathfrak{p}'_n in B with \\\\mathfrak{p}_i = \\\\mathfrak{p}'_i \\\\cap A (going-up and lying over) and two distinct prime ideals with inclusion relation cannot contract to the same prime ideal (incomparability). In particular, the Krull dimensions of A and B are the same. Furthermore, if A is an integrally closed domain, then the going-down holds (see below). In general, the going-up implies the lying-over. Thus, in the below, we simply say the \\"going-up\\" to mean \\"going-up\\" and \\"lying-over\\". When A, B are domains such that B is integral over A, A is a field if and only if B is a field. As a corollary, one has: given a prime ideal \\\\mathfrak{q} of B, \\\\mathfrak{q} is a maximal ideal of B if and only if \\\\mathfrak{q} \\\\cap A is a maximal ideal of A. Another corollary: if L/K is an algebraic extension, then any subring of L containing K is a field.  Applications  Let B be a ring that is integral over a subring A and k an algebraically closed field. If f: A \\\\to k is a homomorphism, then f extends to a homomorphism B → k. This follows from the going-up.  Geometric interpretation of going-up  Let f: A \\\\to B be an integral extension of rings. Then the induced map :\\\\begin{cases} f^\\\\\\\\#: \\\\operatorname{Spec} B \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Spec} A  p \\\\mapsto f^{-1}(p)\\\\end{cases} is a closed map; in fact, f^\\\\\\\\#(V(I)) = V(f^{-1}(I)) for any ideal I and f^\\\\\\\\# is surjective if f is injective. This is a geometric interpretation of the going-up.  Geometric interpretation of integral extensions  Let B be a ring and A a subring that is a noetherian integrally closed domain (i.e., \\\\operatorname{Spec} A is a normal scheme.) If B is integral over A, then \\\\operatorname{Spec} B \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Spec} A is submersive; i.e., the topology of \\\\operatorname{Spec} A is the quotient topology. The proof uses the notion of constructible sets. (See also: torsor (algebraic geometry).) = Integrality, base-change, universally-closed, and geometry = If B is integral over A, then B \\\\otimes_A R is integral over R for any A-algebra R. In particular, \\\\operatorname{Spec} (B \\\\otimes_A R) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Spec} R is closed; i.e., the integral extension induces a \\"universally closed\\" map. This leads to a _geometric characterization of integral extension_. Namely, let B be a ring with only finitely many minimal prime ideals (e.g., integral domain or noetherian ring). Then B is integral over a (subring) A if and only if \\\\operatorname{Spec} (B \\\\otimes_A R) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Spec} R is closed for any A-algebra R. In particular, every proper map is universally closed. = Galois actions on integral extensions of integrally closed domains = :Proposition. Let A be an integrally closed domain with the field of fractions K, L a finite normal extension of K, B the integral closure of A in L. Then the group G = \\\\operatorname{Gal}(L/K) acts transitively on each fiber of \\\\operatorname{Spec} B \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Spec} A. Proof. Suppose \\\\mathfrak{p}_2 e \\\\sigma(\\\\mathfrak{p}_1) for any \\\\sigma in G. Then, by prime avoidance, there is an element x in \\\\mathfrak{p}_2 such that \\\\sigma(x) ot\\\\in \\\\mathfrak{p}_1 for any \\\\sigma. G fixes the element y = \\\\prod olimits_{\\\\sigma} \\\\sigma(x) and thus y is purely inseparable over K. Then some power y^e belongs to K; since A is integrally closed we have: y^e \\\\in A. Thus, we found y^e is in \\\\mathfrak{p}_2 \\\\cap A but not in \\\\mathfrak{p}_1 \\\\cap A; i.e., \\\\mathfrak{p}_1 \\\\cap A e \\\\mathfrak{p}_2 \\\\cap A.  Application to algebraic number theory  The galois group \\\\operatorname{Gal}(L/K) then acts on all of the prime ideals \\\\mathfrak{q}_1,\\\\ldots, \\\\mathfrak{q}_k \\\\in \\\\text{Spec}(\\\\mathcal{O}_L) lying over a fixed prime ideal \\\\mathfrak{p} \\\\in \\\\text{Spec}(\\\\mathcal{O}_K). That is, if > \\\\mathfrak{p} = \\\\mathfrak{q}_1^{e_1}\\\\cdots\\\\mathfrak{q}_k^{e_k} \\\\subset > \\\\mathcal{O}_L then there is a Galois action on the set S_\\\\mathfrak{p} = \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathfrak{q}_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\mathfrak{q}_k \\\\\\\\}. This is called the Splitting of prime ideals in Galois extensions.  Remarks  The same idea in the proof shows that if L/K is a purely inseparable extension (need not be normal), then \\\\operatorname{Spec} B \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Spec} A is bijective. Let A, K, etc. as before but assume L is only a finite field extension of K. Then :(i) \\\\operatorname{Spec} B \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Spec} A has finite fibers. :(ii) the going-down holds between A and B: given \\\\mathfrak{p}_1 \\\\subset \\\\cdots \\\\subset \\\\mathfrak{p}_n = \\\\mathfrak{p}'_n \\\\cap A, there exists \\\\mathfrak{p}'_1 \\\\subset \\\\cdots \\\\subset \\\\mathfrak{p}'_n that contracts to it. Indeed, in both statements, by enlarging L, we can assume L is a normal extension. Then (i) is immediate. As for (ii), by the going-up, we can find a chain \\\\mathfrak{p}_i that contracts to \\\\mathfrak{p}'_i. By transitivity, there is \\\\sigma \\\\in G such that \\\\sigma(\\\\mathfrak{p}_n) = \\\\mathfrak{p}'_n and then \\\\mathfrak{p}'_i = \\\\sigma(\\\\mathfrak{p}_i) are the desired chain.  Integral closure  Let A ⊂ B be rings and A' the integral closure of A in B. (See above for the definition.) Integral closures behave nicely under various constructions. Specifically, for a multiplicatively closed subset S of A, the localization S−1A' is the integral closure of S−1A in S−1B, and A'[t] is the integral closure of A[t] in B[t].An exercise in Atiyah–MacDonald. If A_i are subrings of rings B_i, 1 \\\\le i \\\\le n, then the integral closure of \\\\prod A_i in \\\\prod B_i is \\\\prod {A_i}' where {A_i}' are the integral closures of A_i in B_i. The integral closure of a local ring A in, say, B, need not be local. (If this is the case, the ring is called unibranch.) This is the case for example when A is Henselian and B is a field extension of the field of fractions of A. If A is a subring of a field K, then the integral closure of A in K is the intersection of all valuation rings of K containing A. Let A be an \\\\mathbb{N}-graded subring of an \\\\mathbb{N}-graded ring B. Then the integral closure of A in B is an \\\\mathbb{N}-graded subring of B.Proof: Let \\\\phi: B \\\\to B[t] be a ring homomorphism such that \\\\phi(b_n) = b_n t^n if b_n is homogeneous of degree n. The integral closure of A[t] in B[t] is A'[t], where A' is the integral closure of A in B. If b in B is integral over A, then \\\\phi(b) is integral over A[t]; i.e., it is in A'[t]. That is, each coefficient b_n in the polynomial \\\\phi(b) is in A'. There is also a concept of the integral closure of an ideal. The integral closure of an ideal I \\\\subset R, usually denoted by \\\\overline I, is the set of all elements r \\\\in R such that there exists a monic polynomial :x^n + a_{1} x^{n-1} + \\\\cdots + a_{n-1} x^1 + a_n with a_i \\\\in I with r as a root. Note this is the definition that appears, for example, in Eisenbud and is different from Bourbaki's and Atiyah–MacDonald's definition. For noetherian rings, there are alternate definitions as well. *r \\\\in \\\\overline I if there exists a c \\\\in R not contained in any minimal prime, such that c r^n \\\\in I^n for all n \\\\ge 1. * r \\\\in \\\\overline I if in the normalized blow-up of I, the pull back of r is contained in the inverse image of I. The blow-up of an ideal is an operation of schemes which replaces the given ideal with a principal ideal. The normalization of a scheme is simply the scheme corresponding to the integral closure of all of its rings. The notion of integral closure of an ideal is used in some proofs of the going-down theorem.  Conductor  Let B be a ring and A a subring of B such that B is integral over A. Then the annihilator of the A-module B/A is called the conductor of A in B. Because the notion has origin in algebraic number theory, the conductor is denoted by \\\\mathfrak{f} = \\\\mathfrak{f}(B/A). Explicitly, \\\\mathfrak{f} consists of elements a in A such that aB \\\\subset A. (cf. idealizer in abstract algebra.) It is the largest ideal of A that is also an ideal of B.Chapter 12 of Huneke and Swanson 2006 If S is a multiplicatively closed subset of A, then :S^{-1}\\\\mathfrak{f}(B/A) = \\\\mathfrak{f}(S^{-1}B/S^{-1}A). If B is a subring of the total ring of fractions of A, then we may identify :\\\\ \\\\mathfrak{f}(B/A)=\\\\operatorname{Hom}_A(B, A). Example: Let k be a field and let A = k[t^2, t^3] \\\\subset B = k[t] (i.e., A is the coordinate ring of the affine curve x^2 = y^3.) B is the integral closure of A in k(t). The conductor of A in B is the ideal (t^2, t^3) A. More generally, the conductor of A = kt^a, t^b, a, b relatively prime, is (t^c, t^{c+1}, \\\\dots) A with c = (a-1)(b-1). Suppose B is the integral closure of an integral domain A in the field of fractions of A such that the A-module B/A is finitely generated. Then the conductor \\\\mathfrak{f} of A is an ideal defining the support of B/A; thus, A coincides with B in the complement of V(\\\\mathfrak{f}) in \\\\operatorname{Spec}A. In particular, the set \\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathfrak{p} \\\\in \\\\operatorname{Spec}A \\\\mid A_\\\\mathfrak{p} \\\\text{ is integrally closed} \\\\\\\\}, the complement of V(\\\\mathfrak{f}), is an open set.  Finiteness of integral closure  An important but difficult question is on the finiteness of the integral closure of a finitely generated algebra. There are several known results. The integral closure of a Dedekind domain in a finite extension of the field of fractions is a Dedekind domain; in particular, a noetherian ring. This is a consequence of the Krull–Akizuki theorem. In general, the integral closure of a noetherian domain of dimension at most 2 is noetherian; Nagata gave an example of dimension 3 noetherian domain whose integral closure is not noetherian. A nicer statement is this: the integral closure of a noetherian domain is a Krull domain (Mori–Nagata theorem). Nagata also gave an example of dimension 1 noetherian local domain such that the integral closure is not finite over that domain. Let A be a noetherian integrally closed domain with field of fractions K. If L/K is a finite separable extension, then the integral closure A' of A in L is a finitely generated A-module. This is easy and standard (uses the fact that the trace defines a non-degenerate bilinear form.) Let A be a finitely generated algebra over a field k that is an integral domain with field of fractions K. If L is a finite extension of K, then the integral closure A' of A in L is a finitely generated A-module and is also a finitely generated k-algebra. The result is due to Noether and can be shown using the Noether normalization lemma as follows. It is clear that it is enough to show the assertion when L/K is either separable or purely inseparable. The separable case is noted above; thus, assume L/K is purely inseparable. By the normalization lemma, A is integral over the polynomial ring S = k[x_1, ..., x_d]. Since L/K is a finite purely inseparable extension, there is a power q of a prime number such that every element of L is a q-th root of an element in K. Let k' be a finite extension of k containing all q-th roots of coefficients of finitely many rational functions that generate L. Then we have: L \\\\subset k'(x_1^{1/q}, ..., x_d^{1/q}). The ring on the right is the field of fractions of k'[x_1^{1/q}, ..., x_d^{1/q}], which is the integral closure of S; thus, contains A'. Hence, A' is finite over S; a fortiori, over A. The result remains true if we replace k by Z. The integral closure of a complete local noetherian domain A in a finite extension of the field of fractions of A is finite over A. More precisely, for a local noetherian ring R, we have the following chains of implications: :(i) A complete \\\\Rightarrow A is a Nagata ring :(ii) A is a Nagata domain \\\\Rightarrow A analytically unramified \\\\Rightarrow the integral closure of the completion \\\\widehat{A} is finite over \\\\widehat{A} \\\\Rightarrow the integral closure of A is finite over A. Noether's normalization lemma Noether's normalisation lemma is a theorem in commutative algebra. Given a field K and a finitely generated K-algebra A, the theorem says it is possible to find elements y1, y2, ..., ym in A that are algebraically independent over K such that A is finite (and hence integral) over B = K[y1,..., ym]. Thus the extension K ⊂ A can be written as a composite K ⊂ B ⊂ A where K ⊂ B is a purely transcendental extension and B ⊂ A is finite.Chapter 4 of Reid. Integral morphisms In algebraic geometry, a morphism f:X\\\\to Y of schemes is integral if it is affine and if for some (equivalently, every) affine open cover U_i of Y, every map f^{-1}(U_i)\\\\to U_i is of the form \\\\operatorname{Spec}(A)\\\\to\\\\operatorname{Spec}(B) where A is an integral B-algebra. The class of integral morphisms is more general than the class of finite morphisms because there are integral extensions that are not finite, such as, in many cases, the algebraic closure of a field over the field.  Absolute integral closure  Let A be an integral domain and L (some) algebraic closure of the field of fractions of A. Then the integral closure A^+ of A in L is called the absolute integral closure of A.Melvin Hochster, Math 711: Lecture of September 7, 2007 It is unique up to a non-canonical isomorphism. The ring of all algebraic integers is an example (and thus A^+ is typically not noetherian.)

He took the idea out of the ancient legend of Damon and Pythias issuing from the Latin Fabulae by Gaius Julius Hyginus, as rendered in the medieval collection of the Gesta Romanorum. It magnifies the belief in the love of friendship and fidelity.  Synopsis  Damon and Pythias The ballad is set in the ancient Greek polis of Syracuse. After a failed attempt by Damon to kill the gruesome tyrant Dionysius, he is caught and sentenced to death but asks for a delay to marry his sister to her designated husband. Dionysius allows him an extension of three days on condition that his friend remains with him to guarantee Damon's return. If he would not be back on time, his friend would suffer his punishment, while Damon would go with impunity. To Dionysius' astonishment Damon, despite facing floods, an assault by a bandit gang, beating sun and lack of water on the way back to his own execution, at the last minute returns to save his friend. Ashamed by this deed, the tyrant admits the moral value of fidelity and asks to be considered as a friend in their midst.  Versions  Schiller wrote the original version in summer 1798, simultaneously with his poem Der Kampf mit dem Drachen, and published both in 1799. In 1804 he re-worked the ballad and changed the name of the main character (from initially Moerus to Damon). It was translated into English by 1842 when it appeared in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine. In the late 1930s, Bertolt Brecht wrote a verse commentary \\"Über Schillers Gedicht 'Die Bürgschaft'\\", a sonnet ironically praising the Golden Age in which contract had such moral force that the tyrant realizes that he is hardly needed. This has been set to music by Hanns Eisler. In 1940 the Japanese author Osamu Dazai published the short story Run, Melos! reworking Schiller's poem. It is a widely read classic in Japanese schools.  Musical settings  Franz Schubert set it to music twice: first as a song for voice and piano in 1815 (D 246), and then as an opera in 1816 (D 435) but left off work on the latter the middle of the third act.

Biography Edwards was born in Trevethin parish, Pontypool, Wales, and attended Bristol College, after which he began preaching in 1738. He pastored several small Baptist churches in England for seven years, then moved to Ireland, where he pastored for nine years. In May 1761 he emigrated to the American colonies, and became pastor of the First Baptist Church in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was one of the few Baptist clergyman to side with the Tories in the American Revolution. Edwards was a friend to the Academy of Philadelphia, afterwards the University of Pennsylvania, which in 1769 honored him with an honorary Master of Arts. Edwards resigned as pastor of the First Baptist Church in Philadelphia in 1771 and retired to Pencader Hundred, near Newark, Delaware where he lived until his death in 1795. His grave is located at the Mount Moriah Cemetery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Works Edwards was a Baptist historian. He wrote the first Baptist church manual in the United States titled \\"Customs of Primitive Churches\\". His major work, Materials Toward A History of the Baptists (1770) is an important source describing the Baptists in America. He later wrote a companion volume, Materials Toward A History of the Baptists in New Jersey (1792) In his Materials for a History of the Baptists in Rhode Island, Edwards wrote: \\"The first mover [himself] for it [a Baptist college] in 1762 was laughed at as a projector of a thing impracticable. Nay, many of the Baptists themselves discouraged the design (prophesying evil to the churches in case it should take place) from an unhappy prejudice against learning.\\" Brown University In 1764, Edwards joined The Reverend James Manning, The Reverend Ezra Stiles, the Reverend Isaac Backus, the Reverend John Gano, the Reverend Samuel Stillman, William Ellery, and former Royal Governors Stephen Hopkins and Samuel Ward and several others as an original trustee for the chartering of the College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (the former name for Brown University), the first Baptist college in the original thirteen colonies and one of the Ivy League universities. Pretribulationism Edwards is notable for his early pretribulationism, predating John Nelson Darby (1800–1882) and popularization of the idea of Pretribulationism (the view that Christian believers will be raptured or translated to heaven with Christ before the events of the tribulation).

It was the first of a series of sixteen Lone Star Westerns made for Monogram Pictures between 1933-1935, by Wayne and director Robert N. Bradbury, and the first pairing of Wayne with George \\"Gabby\\" Hayes. Notes John Wayne as Saunders Wayne's singing voice was dubbed, and the film is considerably darker than the Gene Autry singing cowboy movies that followed it; for example, Singin' Sandy's ten-gallon hat was black instead of white and he would grimly chant about \\"streets soon running with blood\\" and \\"you'll be drinking your drinks with the dead\\" as he strode purposefully down the street toward a showdown. Equally dark, the bad man in the film says he has made the ranchers \\"an offer they can't refuse.\\" The supporting cast includes George \\"Gabby\\" Hayes, the acrobatic comedian Al St. John, and the stuntman Yakima Canutt. The movie was written and directed by Robert N. Bradbury. It was the first of the Lone Star Productions released through Metro Goldwyn Mayer. The actual singer, who was singing as this film and Lawless Range were being made, was Bill Bradbury, son of director Robert N. Bradbury and brother of Robert A. Bradbury a.k.a. Bob Steele. Glenn Strange did the singing in Lawless Range. Wayne's dubbed singing, which bore no resemblance to his unique speaking voice, was the reason he soon abandoned the singing cowboy format, as he later played a singing cowboy—though not Singin' Sandy—at least once, in Lawless Range, but he was embarrassed during personal appearances when he couldn't accommodate children who clamored for a Singin' Sandy song. Gene Autry was chosen by the studio as Wayne's replacement in the new genre, immediately solving the live singing problem while ushering in a much lighter take on the format than Wayne's grimly intense rendition.

An example of such a language is Java, which (), does not have a module system at the level of components. Java has a package system, but Java software components typically consist of multiple Java packages and in any case, interface programming can provide advantages over merely using Java packages, even if a component only consists of a single Java package. Interface-based programming defines the application as a collection of components, in which Application Programming Interface (API) calls between components may only be made through abstract interfaces, not concrete classes. Instances of classes will generally be obtained through other interfaces using techniques such as the Factory pattern. This is claimed to increase the modularity of the application and hence its maintainability. However, some caution is warranted merely splitting an application into arbitrary components communicating via interfaces does not in itself guarantee low coupling or high cohesion, two other attributes that are commonly regarded as key for maintainability. An interface-based architecture can be used when third parties or indeed separate teams within the same organisation develop additional components or plugins for an established system. The codebase of the Eclipse IDE is an example of interface-based programming. Eclipse plugin vendors just have to develop components that satisfy the interface specified by the parent application vendor, the Eclipse Foundation. Indeed, in Eclipse, even the original components such as the Java Development Tools are themselves plugins. This is somewhat like a mobile phone manufacturer specifying a mobile charger interface (pin arrangement, expected direct current voltage, etc.) and both the manufacturer and third parties making their own mobile phone chargers that comply with this standard interface specification.  Software evolution in interface-based programming The use of interfaces to allow disparate teams to collaborate raises the question of how interface changes happen in interface-based programming. The problem is that if an interface is changed, e.g. by adding a new method, old code written to implement the interface will no longer compile and in the case of dynamically-loaded or linked plugins, will either fail to load or link, or crash at runtime. There are two basic approaches for dealing with this problem: # a new interface may be developed with additional functionality, which might inherit from the old interface # a software versioning policy such as semantic versioning 2.0 may be communicated to interface implementors, to allow forward-incompatible, or even backward- incompatible, changes in future \\"major\\" versions of the platform Both of these approaches have been used in the Java platform.  Design by contract  The publisher of the interfaces generally promises that they will not change the interface in new \\"minor\\" versions of the software, and the implementer, by implementing the interface, implies that they have implemented at least the required parts of the interface without any deviation. An interface can therefore be viewed as a \\"contractual agreement\\" between a provider and a consumer of the interface. If this contract is documented more formally as a software specification, this is an example of design by contract. However, design by contract per se does not mandate the use of interfaces for all components.

Premise Night Calls is a live phone- in program where listeners are invited to call in and discuss sexual issues—usually fantasies. The shows hosts have invariably been female porn stars, who depending on the nature of the call may interact with the caller while performing (non-explicit) sexual acts such as masturbation or playing with sex toys. Sometimes the callers (male and female) will be heard engaged in sexual activity of their own, ranging from masturbation to intercourse. The show also frequently features animated shorts that often feature the character of Brickhouse Betty, a web animation character created by the animation team Rum Runners. The shorts containing Brickhouse Betty usually center around her being tricked or coerced into sexual encounters with various male characters. History Nowwatchtvlive.org - Originally featuring hosts Juli Ashton and Doria Rone (1996–1998), Doria was eventually replaced by Tiffany Granath. Granath and Ashton co-hosted the show from November 1998 until early 2006 at which time the show was recast and reworked. In early 2006, Playboy TV cast adult stars Jesse Jane and Kirsten Price in the host roles for the final 14 months of the series' run. A British version of the show also exists (on Playboy One). The U.S. version was filmed in Los Angeles, and it was redesigned when Jesse Jane's started presenting. In its final incarnation, the series used a far larger set with striptease poles, a house band and a live studio audience. Spinoffs The Helmetcam Show ran on Playboy TV from July 17, 1996 to July 19, 2000. Eighty live episodes were produced. The show was hosted and produced by Gary Gray. Featuring a conventional talk show format, and conceived as a low-cost promotional opportunity for other PlayboyTV programming, the show highlighted clips from other PlayboyTV shows. Night Calls 411 ran on Playboy TV from 2000 to 2005. It focused on sex tips and featured an ethnically diverse cast. It was originally hosted by Crystal Knight and Flower Edwards, with Tera Patrick as the \\"Net Nympho\\", who read e-mail and bantered with the hosts while disrobing. Patrick left after the first season as her career ascended but returned in June 2001 as co-host when Flower was pregnant. Kitana Baker took over the part of \\"Net Nympho\\". Tera was replaced by Nikki Nova in February 2003 when she got in a contract dispute with her company, Digital Playground. Nova would remain co-host until the show's demise; Knight was on for the entire run. A month later, Nicole Oring became the \\"Net Nympho\\". Night Calls 411 originally ran 8 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. PST on the second and fourth Wednesdays of each month except January and August (i.e. on the weeks Night Calls wasn't on) until July 2004. From October 2004 to its abrupt demise in May 2005, it ran once a month, on a Friday, for an hour. During this time, they had rotating guests as the \\"Net Nympho\\". Night Calls 411 became Playboy TV's highest rated and most successful TV show in history. Night Calls Hotline ran from 2004 to 2005. It was hosted by Ashley Blue, Nautica Thorn, and Ann-Marie (who later left to do Private Calls). In 1998, Ashton and Rone co-starred in a feature-length direct-to-video motion picture entitled Night Calls: The Movie in which the two appeared as themselves. Playboy Radio, Sirius & XM channel 102, continues to air a version of Night Calls, co-hosted by adult film stars Debi Diamond and Nicki Hunter.

While most of the conventional literature assumes the use of modern technology, Wild Fermentation focuses more on the practice and culture of fermenting food. The term \\"wild fermentation\\" refers to the reliance on naturally occurring bacteria and yeast to ferment food. For example, conventional bread making requires the use of a commercial, highly specialized yeast, while wild-fermented bread relies on naturally occurring cultures that are found on the flour, in the air, and so on. Similarly, the book's instructions on sauerkraut require only cabbage and salt, relying on the cultures that naturally exist on the vegetable to perform the fermentation. The book also discusses some foods that are not, strictly speaking, wild ferments such as miso, yogurt, kefir, and nattō. Beyond food, the book includes some discussion of social, personal, and political issues, such as the legality of raw milk cheeses in the United States.

It is located at Hill Air Force Base, Utah. The squadron was activated late in World War II. Intended as a long-range escort unit, it deployed to the Pacific, but remained in Hawaii until it was inactivated after VJ Day. The squadron was reactivated in 1952 as the 466th Fighter-Escort Squadron, but was inactivated in 1956, when the concept of fighters escorting formations of bombers no longer jibed with United States military thinking. Overview The 419th uses 15 F-16C/D model aircraft, which are light, air- to-air daytime fighters. The 466th Fighter Squadron first saw action in 1998, participating in Exercise Cope Tiger. This is a drill which puts reserve pilots shoulder to shoulder with members of the Thailand and Singapore Air Forces. Later that year, the 466th was deployed to Kuwait in time for Operation Southern Watch. The 466th was part of a unit attempting to hold off Iraqi movements toward Kuwaiti and Saudi Arabia. History =World War II= Formed in late 1944 under Second Air Force as one of the last Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighter squadrons, programmed for deployment to Western Pacific theater with long-range P-47N for Boeing B-29 Superfortress escort missions. Arrived in Hawaii in early 1945, assigned to Seventh Air Force. Lack of a serious fighter defense over Japan at high altitudes and reprogramming of B-29 raids over Japan to night low-level fast attacks led to reassignment as an air defense and training unit in Hawaii. =Early Cold War fighter escort= Reactivated as the 466th Fighter-Escort Squadron to accompany formations of Strategic Air Command Boeing B-50 Superfortress and Convair B-36 Peacemaker bombers. Twice deployed to Japan to augment air defense forces there. Inactivated in 1956 with the phaseout of the escort mission and retirement of the B-36. =Reserve fighter operations= Activated again in the reserve as the 466th Tactical Fighter Squadron in 1972 as a Republic F-105 Thunderchief squadron, being equipped with aircraft returned from inactivated Vietnam War squadrons. Since 1984 has trained to fly interdiction, close air support, and counter-air missions. Deployed periodically for contingency operations, or for training exercises with other units.

Anbangbang Billabong lies in the shadow of Nourlangie Rock within Kakadu National Park and is a good place to view a wide range of wildlife. Large numbers of water fowl and wading birds inhabit the billabong and many wallabies can be found grazing around the water's edge. There is a walking trail around the circumference of Anbangbang Billabong with many picnic areas.  Geography  Nourlangie Rock, as seen from Anbangbang Billabong towards the end of the wet season. The Anbangbang Billabong is overlooked by the Nawurlandja and Nourlangie plateaus. In the wet season, it is fed by runoff from these plateaus, as well as overflow from Nourlangie Creek, however during the dry season it is cut off. = Fauna = Like much of Kakadu, Anbangbang Billabong is home to a particularly large variety of bird life. The fluctuating water levels draw waterfowl such as magpie geese, pelicans, darters, spoonbills and brolga. Other fauna known to frequent the billabong include wallabies, file snakes, long-necked turtles, dingoes and goannas. Mangroves lining the billabong support populations of freshwater mussel. Adjacent woodlands play host to a different ecosystem again. The nearby Nawurlandja plateau supports local populations of short-eared rock-wallaby and chestnut-quilled rock pigeon, among other species. = Flora = The swelling billabong promotes seasonal growth of sedges, grasses, water lilies, and freshwater mangrove line the water's edge. Swamp areas support many types of paperbark, in particular the weeping paperbark, silver-leaved paperbark and broad-leaved paperbark. The woodlands surrounding the billabong are a lush habitat comprising an abundance of plant species. Darwin woollybutt and Darwin stringybark dominate, with large populations of fan palms, kapok, red apples, wattle and Pandanus. = Climate = Like much of Kakadu, the Anbangbang Billabong region's climate is monsoonal. The region's aboriginal owners recognize six seasons, however these can be reduced to vastly differing dry and wet seasons where the billabong is respectively depleted and replenished.  Tourism  Aboriginal rock painting of Mimi spirits in the Anbangbang gallery at Nourlangie Rock. Anbangbang Billabong has a marked, 2.5 km circular walk, popular with tourists to Kakadu National Park, but accessible only during the dry season. It is a hotspot for bird watching during the late dry and early wet seasons due to the abundance of birdlife. The nearby Nourlangie plateau and Anbangbang shelter are of particular interest for their aboriginal rock art and 20,000 year old history.  Aboriginal beliefs  A local creation story tells that the Anbangbang Billabong was formed by a pair of short-eared rock wallabies, or badbong, who are responsible for cutting the rock and parting the trees to form the current landscape.

He was murdered on December 27, 2015. Career =Club= Pacheco spent the majority of his career with one of El Salvador's biggest clubs, FAS. After moving through the junior ranks and into the first team reserves, he was given his first chance to play in the Salvadoran Primera División in 2001. He made his professional debut on March 3, 2001, in a league match against C.D. Municipal Limeño. In 2005, he was named club captain. On February 18, 2009, it was announced that New York Red Bulls head coach Juan Carlos Osorio had traveled to El Salvador with the hopes of bringing Pacheco to Major League Soccer. Pacheco had been scouted for several months, most notably during FIFA World Cup qualification matches, as well as during the UNCAF Nations Cup tournament. It was initially announced that Pacheco signed with New York Red Bulls on March 5, 2009, but due to difficulties surrounding his International Transfer Card Pacheco: ITC problems the New York front office did not officially announce his signing until April 17, 2009.Pacheco: Officially Signed In the meantime Pacheco started training with the Red Bulls on April 7, 2009 and after his official signing made his first appearance on April 18, 2009.

That same year Pacheco was also part of the El Salvador U-23 team that won the Central American and Caribbean Games gold medal, after defeating Mexico in the final. Again, that same year, Pacheco received his first cap with the men's national team. This was on November 17, 2002, in a friendly match against the USA. Pacheco scored his first goal for El Salvador, off a free-kick vs Costa Rica in a 2003 Gold Cup Quarterfinals match. Pacheco is currently the top most capped player of all- time for El Salvador with 86 caps. On September 20, 2013, Pacheco was one of 14 Salvadoran players banned for life due to their involvement with match fixing.

Life and career Hardin grew up in Vegreville, Alberta and attended university at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. He started his professional career as a playwright following his graduation. His best known play is Esker Mike and His Wife, Agiluk. Hardin worked as a freelance radio broadcaster for both CBC Radio and Radio-Canada (the CBC's French-language network). In the 1970s, he established the Association for Public Broadcasting in British Columbia and the Capital Cable Co-operative in Victoria to lobby for the expansion of public, non-commercial broadcasting. He was also active as a consumer advocate opposing cable rate increases. In the late 1970s, he worked as a Vancouver- based editorial page columnist for The Toronto Star writing on politics and economics. He also wrote a number of non-fiction books, his first being A Nation Unaware: The Canadian Economic Culture (1974), which explored the key role of public enterprise in the development of Canada's economy and the country's distinctive interregional redistribution. This was followed by Closed Circuits: The Sellout of Canadian Television (1985), an exposé of television politics and how power works in Canada, and The Privatization Putsch (1989), a debunking of the privatization movement. A subsequent major work, The New Bureaucracy: Waste and Folly in the Private Sector (1991), detailed the bureaucratic character and excesses of the corporate world (including finance and marketing) and how this \\"new bureaucracy\\" had become entrenched behind what he called an \\"ideological screen,\\" in this instance, the ideology of free enterprise. Also of note: Working Dollars: The VanCity Story (1996), a history of Vancity Savings Credit Union, the large credit union in Vancouver and now also in Victoria. Hardin contested the leadership of the federal New Democratic Party in 1995 following the resignation of Audrey McLaughlin. The only candidate in the four-person race who had never been an elected politician, Hardin ran a grassroots campaign that emphasized democratic socialist themes. He received 4.78% of the vote in the One Member One Vote national party primaries which was insufficient to allow him to proceed to the delegated NDP leadership convention. He subsequently was an NDP candidate in Vancouver South—Burnaby placing third in the 1997 general electionVANCOUVER SOUTH--BURNABY (1997/06/02), Parliament of Canada website and again in the 2000 federal election.VANCOUVER SOUTH--BURNABY (2000/11/27), Parliament of Canada website Hardin served on the board of the publicly run Insurance Corporation of British Columbia in the 1990s and was chair of the board's Road Safety Committee and then its Product Committee. In the 1990s he returned briefly to playwriting with The New World Order, a political play about what the United States had in store for the world following the first Gulf War. Hardin is a member of the Writers' Union of Canada. He has been a longtime environmentalist and is a member of SPEC (Society Promoting Environmental Conservation). Other memberships include the B.C. Civil Liberties Association, Amnesty International, the North Shore Schizophrenia Society, the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, Co-op Radio, Theatre in the Raw, and the Council of Canadians. His commitment to the North Shore Schizophrenia Society has become particularly significant for him in the last couple of decades and has involved everything from major advocacy work to playing Santa Claus at the society's annual Christmas banquet. He lives with his wife Marguerite in West Vancouver.

Raet is the largest terminal moraine in Scandinavia. It was formed during the end of the last glacial period, 12,800–11,500 years ago, in one of the latest advances of the glaciers. As the glacier retreated towards the end of this period, it could stop for hundreds of years before moving forward again. Material that the glacier brought from the inland, such as particles of rocks, gravel, sand and clay, gathered where the edge of the ice laid still for some time. Such deposits, which are partly deposited on land and partly in ocean, are called terminal moraine. As the ice pulled back and the land rose, these deposits were left behind in the landscape. Later these deposits have been affected by sea and precipitation so that the roughest material remains on the surface. If you dig yourself through a terminal moraine, it is the variation in the size of the particles that are striking; it consists of unsorted material. Agricultural areals by Akersvannet i Stokke in Vestfold og Telemark. Several steps of terminal moraines or ra-steps in Norway can be identified. The oldest are located in the sea and along the sea, the youngest in the mountain valleys. From ancient times, parts of Raet have been important as a route in Norway, especially in Vestfold and Østfold. The word \\"ra\\" The word ra is of Old Norwegian origin and means a ridge of gravel. The word is used in Norwegian as a general term about terminal moraine. This structure goes a long way over land and elsewhere under water. In Vestfold and Østfold, this geological formation is very visible and well- known. The Ra step was deposited for about 10,600 years ago around a glacier covering most of Scandinavia and had its center above what is today Bottenviken. Raet as the name of this long ridge through Vestfold is very old; in Horten municipality lies a farm called Ra. The word is used as farm name in many places in Norway, this is farms located on terminal moraines. Today, knowledge of moraines and the ice age is taken as granted, but the knowledge about this is only about 150 years old. Geology research on moraines and the Ice Age took place in the mid-1800s, and it took a long time before an understanding of how the ra-step forms a coherent structure around the ice with Bottenviken as the center. Ra-trinnet Mølen, helt sørvest i Brunlanes. The Ra-step can be followed from Finland through Sweden to Northern Norway, some places in the sea, elsewhere far inland. From Sweden the ra-step can be followed into Østfold at Halden - Moss, it crosses Oslofjorden at Jeløya and reaches Horten, continues through Vestfold og Telemark, follows highway 19 to Gulli, then old E18 to Larvik, through Bøkeskogen, over the Farris eidet and continues beyond Brunlanes, extends into the sea and is visible above sea level as islands along Telemark and Aust-Agder: Mølen, Jomfruland, Merdø and some other small islands. East of Fevik in Grimstad, Raet goes on land and continues west to Rogaland and along Western Norway, Trøndelag and Northern Norway. Farrisvannet sett fra Gopledal vannverk In Trøndelag, the ra-step is called Tautra because the ice edge crossed the Trondheimsfjord at Tautra. Raet dams up several lakes. In Østfold Vannsjø is among the seas that are created in this way, and in Vestfold this applies to Borrevannet, Goksjø and Farris as well as the lake Rore in Grimstad. Ytre Raet There is also a somewhat older maternity disposition a little beyond the big Raet, or Ra-stage, and this is often called Ytre Raet. This older stage is 250 years older than the main stage. The geographic distance between Raet and Ytre Raet varies, and the distance is greatest through Sandefjord, Nøtterøy and Tønsberg where Ytre Raet crosses the northern part of Nøtterøy and continues in Slagen, Ringshaug and Skallevold. In Brunlanes and at Fredrikstad and Halden the distance is shorter between the two ra-steps. Ytre Raet contributes to large, good agricultural areas in the municipalities of Sandefjord, Nøtterøy and Tønsberg. The road at Raet Raet has been a major ancient trackway through large parts of Vestfold for more than thousand years. Tumuli and church buildings are located close to this trackway, as here is the old main highway. The image is from Skjee in the Sandefjord municipality. Riksvei 19 between Horten and Tønsberg, near the farm Ra follow the ancient trackway. Raet is used as place name for large parts of the ra through Østfold and Vestfold. Raet was in old age a convenient route, because there were so few watercourses to cross. When Bishop Jens Nilsson went on visits to Østfold and Bohuslän in the late 16th century, he traveled along Raet because it was easily accessible. Still E6 in Østfold and E18 in Vestfold follow Raet for long distances. Raet also attracted settlements, so that the oldest, largest and best farms are still there. Similarly tumuli in Iron Age often was located along Raet.Einar Østmo: Arkeologi for alle (s. 94), Landbruksforlaget, Oslo 1998, The top of the moraine has been used as road from prehistoric times, and in some places Raveien is the name of the road. E18 long followed this old trace in Vestfold from Sem to Farriseidet. Now the road in the main traces follows a trace inside the raid. In Østfold, E6 follows Raet from Halden to Moss. The place Helgeroa in Vestfold, near the Mølen, where Raet descended on the seabed, became a central place for a period of communication precisely because the location lay there the natural road in the direction of the east through Vestfold. Protection Several areas of raet are protected as national parks, landscaping areas and nature reserves. Two national parks are on the Raet: Jomfruland National Park in Telemark and Raet National Park in Aust-Agder. In Vestfold Mølen and Bøkeskogen in Larvik and Bøkemoa in the Sandefjord protected. Gea Norvegica Geopark has as one of its tasks to convey knowledge about the importance of geology, and has information boards, among other things, on the Mølen in Brunlanes in Larvik municipality. Steps in ice melting in Eastern Norway In Eastern Norway, the different stages of ice melting are clearly marked in the landscape with endemorins in several stages. The provisions in Eastern Norway are best investigated, and the moral steps in Eastern Norway have therefore become a reference framework in the national context. Mostly, it has been so that the ice has moved forward at the same time in a larger area. The oldest ra-step to be seen in Oslofjord is called Tjøme-Hvaler-step and is approximately 11,200 years old. The next step is called Ytre Raet and is approximately 10,850 years old, while the main stage, Ra-Step, is approx. 10,600 years old. Younger is the Ås-Ski-step, which forms the threshold for Inner Oslofjord. This is about 10,200–10,400 years old. Large sand areas are deposited as the ice lay at Drøbak-Svelvik. The next stop for the ice edge is called the Aker-step in the Groruddalen where the deposits demolishes Maridalsvannet, Bogstadvannet and Sognsvann. In Sylling, the acronym dams up Holsfjorden. The Aker step is approx. 9,800 years old. On Romerike there are several steps of which Gardermoen or Hauerseter is the most marked with large sandboxes. This is about 9,600 years old. Then the Minnesund-step is the last before the ice melted. This is about 9,500 years old.

The Convention was originally intended as a Protocol to the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, while the 1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons was adopted to cover stateless persons who are not refugees and therefore not within the scope of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.van Waas, Laura Ellen. Laura Nationality Matters: Statelessness under International Law, p.21 Statelessness prior to World War II While one case of statelessness was identified in the Protocol relating to a Certain Case of Statelessness at the League of Nations Codification Conference, 1930 in The Hague: \\"In a State whose nationality is not conferred by the mere fact of birth in its territory, a person born in its territory of a mother possessing the nationality of that State and of a father without nationality or of unknown nationality shall have the nationality of the said State.\\" Over time, many signatories have adjusted their laws to ensure this rule remains true. (For example, in Australian nationality law, a child born in the country acquires citizenship if any parent is a citizen). However, despite this, many cases remained ambiguous or uncovered primarily due to the fact that a person did not always receive the nationality of its parents, or was born in a certain place and not always provided citizenship of that state.http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6b39520.html The Nansen International Office For Refugees, an organization of the League of Nations, was internationally in charge of refugees from war areas from 1930 to 1939. It received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1938. Their Nansen passports, designed in 1922 by founder Fridtjof Nansen, were internationally recognized identity cards first issued by the League of Nations to stateless refugees. In 1942 they were honored by governments in 52 countries and were the first refugee travel documents. Background to UN action addressing the problem of statelessness The Room of the United Nations General Assembly where Resolution was passed in 1949 which inspired the adoption of the Convention Regarding the Status of Stateless Persons in 1954 and the completion of the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness Migrations forced from political instability during World War II and its immediate aftermath highlighted the international dimensions of problems presented by unprecedented volumes of displaced persons including those rendered effectively stateless. Dating from December 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights at Article 15 affirms that: * Everyone has the right to a nationality. * No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality nor denied the right to change his nationality. At the Fourth United Nations General Assembly Session in October–December 1949, the International Law Commission included the topic \\"Nationality, including statelessness\\" in its list of topics of international law provisionally selected for codification. At the behest of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in its 11th Session soon after, that item was given priority. The Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees was done on 28 July 1951. It was originally desired to cover 'refugees and stateless persons'; however, agreement was not reached with respect to the latter. The International Law Commission at its fifth session in 1953 produced both a Draft Convention on the Elimination of Future Statelessness, and a Draft Convention on the Reduction of Future Statelessness. ECOSOC approved both drafts. The 1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons was done in September 1954 (The Status Convention).http://www.unhcr.org/protect/PROTECTION/3bbb25729.pdf This completed the unfinished work of the Refugee Convention three years prior. On 4 December 1954 the UN General Assembly by ResolutionOds Home Page adopted both drafts as the basis of its desire for a conference of plenipotentiaries and an eventual Convention. How the convention works to reduce statelessness In respect of contracting states: * \\"Stateless birth\\" on their territory attracts the grant of their nationality (article 1). * Otherwise stateless persons may take the nationality of the place of their birth or of the place where they were found (in the case of a foundling), otherwise they may take the nationality of one of their parents (in each case possibly subject to a qualifying period of residence in that State) (article 2). * A stateless person has some time beyond attaining adulthood to seek to claim the benefit of the Convention. That time is always at least three years from the age of eighteen (article 1(5)). * Transfer of territory between states must occur in a manner that avoids the occurrence of statelessness for persons residing in the territory transferred. When a State acquires territory, the inhabitants of that territory presumptively acquire the nationality of that State (article 10). * Persons otherwise stateless shall be able to take the nationality of one of their parents (possibly subject to a period of prior residence not more than three years) (article 4). * Absent circumstances of fraudulent application or disloyalty toward the contracting state, deprivations and renunciations of citizenship shall only take effect where a person has or subsequently obtains another nationality in replacement (article 8). * The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will issue travel documents evidencing nationality to persons, otherwise stateless, having a claim of nationality under the convention. * Birth on a sea vessel or aircraft may attract the nationality of the flag of that vessel or craft (article 3). * Disloyal or certain criminal conduct may limit an individual's ability to avail the benefit of the Convention (article 8). * The benefit of the Convention may be claimed by guardians on behalf of children (article 1(1)). * States may impose a period of residence qualification for granting nationality to persons who may be otherwise stateless. That period is a maximum five years immediately prior to application and maximum of ten years overall (article 1(2)). Substantive provisions of the convention United Nations Headquarters, New York. Site of the completion of the Statelessness Reduction Convention in 1961 There are 21 Articles, summarised below: ; Article 1(1) : Contracting States shall grant their nationality to persons, otherwise stateless, born in their territory (subject to Article 1(2)). : The grant may be by virtue of the birth, or upon application by or on behalf of the person so born. ; Article 1(2) : An applicant may have up until at least the age of 21 to claim their citizenship by birth from article 1(1). : For grant of citizenship by birth, a Contracting State may require proof of habitual residence in their territory for a period not exceeding 5 years immediately prior to application, or 10 years in total. : Grant of citizenship by birth may be contingent upon the applicant's not having been convicted of an offence against national security nor having been sentenced to imprisonment for a term of five years or more.

This equates to 37.1% of Northern Ireland's population. Overview The area was first officially classified as a metropolitan area in the late 1990s when the British government began to prepare for a cohesive plan that would include the Belfast Region. Six local government districts – Belfast, Castlereagh, Carrickfergus, Lisburn, Newtownabbey and North Down, were identified as the key areas within the metropolitan area. The continuous built-up area centred on Belfast, which is contained within these six districts, is defined as the Belfast Metropolitan Urban Area. The Belfast metropolitan urban area had a population of 579,276 in 2001. The area is made up of established towns, their overspill and the general conjoining of settlements as Belfast expands. Established towns include Carrickfergus, Bangor, Lisburn and Holywood. Many of these towns were established and important long before Belfast rose to prominence; Carrickfergus, for example, was the Norman capital of the northern part of Ireland until Edward Bruce's defeat in 1318. Bangor had been an important centre of Christianity and learning from its foundation in 555 AD. The recent reclassification of Lisburn as a city does not change its position within the metropolitan area.

Created and maintained by the State of Victoria, the map series is currently in a transition phase, with traditional Vicmap Topographic maps being gradually replaced with a new map series. History The traditional set of Vicmap Topographic maps consist of approximately 850 1:25000 and 1:50000 hardcopy topographic map sheets printed and made available for sale to the general public. These map sheets cover 80% of Victoria. Most of the mapsheets are single format at a scale of 1:25000. Less inhabited areas of the state are covered by double format 1:25000 and 1:50000 mapsheets. All of these maps were produced using traditional cartographic methods, with the majority being last updated in the 1970s and 1980s. New Series In 2004 a proposal was put forward by Spatial Information Infrastructure to create a new series of Topographic Maps. There were two main reasons for a new series to be developed. Firstly, the majority of the old map series utilises the now obsolete AGD66 datum and secondly, the bulk of the old map series is out of date, with 40% of these map sheets being 21 to 30 years old, 50% 11 to 20 years old and only 10% less than 10 years old. The new series utilises the new Geodetic Datum of Australia 1994 and is currently being created using a Geographic Information System rather than traditional cartographic methods. Data and Symbology The spatial data used in the new maps is Vicmap Topographic data, which includes Vicmap Digital Framework Datasets along with other key government datasets. Vicmap data is the authoritative spatial data for the State of Victoria and is the foundation of Victoria's primary mapping and geographic information systems. The features depicted in Vicmap Topographic maps include both natural features, such as watercourses, contours, cliffs and tree cover, and constructed features, such as drains, gates, roads and shipwrecks. The traditional 1:25,000 printed topographic maps have been used as a benchmark for the new Vicmap Topographic products. Hence the new series replicates the features and associated symbology as depicted on the old maps. Products The new series of Vicmap Topographic maps consists of 1:25000 and 1:50000 double format hardcopy maps, along with 1:30000 A4 and A3 online mapsheets. The new hardcopy maps are gradually replacing the old stock, with the entire state anticipated to be available at 1:50000 by December 2008. A4 and A3 size maps covering the entire state of Victoria are currently available to the public online. See link below.

FMAP eligible programs are joint federal-state partnerships between the federal government of the United States and state governments, which are administered by the states. Thus, FMAP is an example of administration of federal assistance in the United States. Funds that are eligible for FMAP match include Medicaid, State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) expenditures, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Contingency Funds, the Federal share of Child Support Enforcement collections, and Child Care Mandatory and Matching Funds of the Child Care and Development Fund.http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/01jan20051800/edocket.access.gpo.gov/2005/pdf/05-23392.pdf State governments use FMAP percentages to determine the federal government's contribution to specific state administered programs and assess their related budgetary outlays. For example, the general 2006-2007 FMAP rate for California was 50% meaning that for every dollar that California contributed to an eligible social or medical program between 2006 and 2007, the federal government also contributed one dollar. Within Medicaid, the FMAP can vary. For example, the FMAP for administrative activities is between 50 and 100%. For provider payments, certain populations, programs, and services have enhanced FMAPs, such as the Children's Health Insurance Program, individuals enrolled in Medicaid Expansion, and certain women with breast or cervical cancer.  History  Pursuant to Section 1905(b) of the Social Security Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services calculates the Federal Medical Assistance Percentages each year. This calculation is based upon a formula which compares individual state income to the continental United States income in order to determine ratios the federal government will utilize in assisting each state under the Act. This section also provides that no state's ratio will go lower than 50% or higher than 83%. The guidelines for calculating the FMAP are outlined in the Social Security Act and they exclusively determine the ratio of matching funds for each state's Medicaid program. Section 2105(b)of the Act stipulate that \\"Enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentages,\\" or Enhanced FMAPs, will be calculated at the same time as the FMAPs. Enhanced FMAPs provide ratios for states to follow in funding their State Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP.

She was ordered in January 1918 from William Beardmore & Company with the 13th Order for Destroyers of the Emergency War Program of 1918–19. She was the second Royal Navy ship to carry the name which was first used in 1821 for a hired packet. Construction HMS Vansittarts keel was laid on 7 January 1918 at the William Beardmore & Company Shipyard at Dalmuir. She was launched on 17 April 1919. She was 312 feet overall in length with a beam of 29.5 feet. Her mean draught was 9 feet, and would reach 11.25 feet under full load. She had a displacement of 1,140 tons standard and up to 1,550 full load. She was propelled by three Yarrow water tube boilers powering Brown-Curtis geared steam turbines developing 27,000 SHP driving two screws for a maximum designed speed of 34 knots. She was oil-fired and had a bunkerage of 320 to 370 tons. This gave a range of between 3500 nautical miles at 15 knots and 900 nautical miles at 32 knots. She shipped four BL 4.7 in (120-mm) Mk.I guns, mount P Mk.I naval guns in four single centre-line turrets. The turrets were disposed as two forward and two aft in super imposed firing positions. She also carried two QF 2 pdr Mk.II \\"pom-pom\\" (40 mm L/39) mounted abeam between funnels. Abaft of the second funnel, she carried six 21-inch torpedo tubes in two triple mounts on the centre-line. Inter-War period HMS Vansittart was commissioned on 5 November 1919 into the Royal Navy and assigned the pennant number D64. After her acceptance trials she was assigned to the 4th Destroyer Flotilla in the Atlantic Fleet. In 1925 the 4th Flotilla was transferred to the Mediterranean. In early 1930s she underwent a refit and was placed in reserve as more modern destroyers came into service. This ship was laid-up in Maintenance Reserve at Rosyth with a special complement. She was reactivated manned by Reservists for a Royal Review at Weymouth in August 1939. As war loomed she was brought to war readiness. Second World War HMS Vansittart was allocated to the 15th Destroyer Flotilla in the Western Approaches Command and deployed in the English Channel for convoy defence. Her first deployment was to escort troops of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) from the Solent to Brest. In October she was transferred to the 17th Destroyer Flotilla based at Plymouth for convoy defence in the South-West Approaches. She remained in this deployment through April when she was sent to Scapa Flow in response to the German invasion of Norway. \\"Venus\\", the bulldog mascot of HMS Vansittart. She was deployed in protecting military convoys until she was damaged at Narvik during an air attack on 10 May, during the Battles of Narvik. On 20 May she deployed on Operation Ordnance – the evacuation of Dutch ports including Rotterdam and the Hook of Holland. At the end of May her pennant number was changed to I64 for visual signalling purposes. In June she was again deployed to the South-West approaches. On 1 July she responded to a distress signal from the torpedoed merchant ship . An hour after arriving on the scene she established a strong ASDIC return and made two runs dropping eleven depth charges set for 350 to 500 feet. After this attack she was unable to re- establish contact, and observed a large oil slick. She recovered the survivors of SS Clearton and remained on patrol until the next day, before returning to port. Post war analysis credited her with the sinking of U-102 on 1 July. During her career she underwent one reconstruction, to serve as a long range escort. Such maintenance was completed in June 1943. Disposition On 25 February 1946, HMS Vansittart was sold to be broken up for scrap.

By birth, she was a Princess and Duchess of Bavaria as the daughter of Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor, Elector of Bavaria, and Archduchess Maria Amalia of Austria. Family A member of the House of Wittelsbach, she was born in Munich, Bavaria. Maria Josepha was the seventh and youngest child of Charles Albert, Elector of Bavaria, and Holy Roman Emperor. Her mother, Maria Amalia, was an Archduchess of Austria by birth. Her maternal grandparents were Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor, and Wilhelmina Amalia of Brunswick-Lüneburg. Her paternal grandparents were Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, and Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska, the daughter of the King of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, John III Sobieski. Josepha's mother, Archduchess Maria Amalia, was also a first cousin to her future mother-in-law, Empress Maria Theresa, and therefore Josepha was a second cousin to her future husband, Joseph, King of the Romans. Josepha's mother, Archduchess Maria Amalia, gave birth to seven children, only four of whom lived through to adulthood. Maria Josepha's siblings included her brother Maximilian III, Elector of Bavaria, and two sisters Maria Antonia, Electress of Saxony, and Maria Anna Josepha, Margravine of Baden-Baden. Marriage Maria Josepha as Queen. Portrait by Martin van Meytens, 1765. Maria Josepha was first married by proxy on 13 January 1765, to her second cousin, the widowed Joseph, King of the Romans, and heir of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria in Munich, Germany. Upon her arrival to Vienna from Munich, her husband did not seem to be dissatisfied with his new wife and neither did the entourage who greeted the princess. She and Joseph formally married on 25 January 1765, at the Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna, amidst suitable festivities. The marriage, however, was never happy; it had taken place only under pressure from Joseph's mother, Maria Theresa, who wanted her son to provide an heir to the throne. Joseph, however, had never wanted to remarry after the death of his beloved first wife, Isabella of Parma, although he had made some overtures toward Isabella's younger sister, Maria Luisa of Parma. Maria Luisa, however, was already promised to the Crown Prince of Spain and, in any case, was not interested. Joseph did not find Maria Josepha physically attractive either—he described her in a letter when he first saw her as, \\"She is twenty five. She has never had smallpox, and the very thought of the disease makes me shudder. Her figure is short, thickset, and without a vestige of charm. Her face is covered with spots and pimples. Her teeth are horrible.\\" However, Wenzel Anton, Prince of Kaunitz-Rietberg, had wanted Joseph to marry Maria Josepha because of the Bavarian connection, so she was ultimately selected to be Joseph's bride. A month after his wedding, Joseph sent off a long, self- pitying letter to his first wife's father. He did not have anything in common with his new wife, he admitted; however, as far as her character was concerned, Maria Josepha was an \\"irreproachable woman\\" who loved him, and he valued her for her positive traits but suffered because he could not love her. Even her enemies admitted that Josepha was amiable, obliging, friendly to all, and disposed to every kind or benevolent sentiment; but her understanding was narrow as well as deficient in cultivation. Joseph further added, \\"I will keep the path of honour, and if I cannot be an affectionate husband, at least she will have in me a friend, who appreciates her good qualities and treats her with every imaginable consideration.\\" Despite this, Joseph never kept his word. As time went on he did more than treat Josepha with perfect frigidity. Maria Josepha's sister-in-law, Archduchess Maria Christina, once wrote: \\"I believe if I were his [Joseph's] wife and so maltreated I would run away and hang myself on a tree in Schonbrunn.\\" Despite Joseph's cold behaviour towards her, Maria Josepha had loved her husband with much ardour and was deeply affected by his unkindness towards her. Being of a meek and timid disposition, and conscious of her own inferiority, she trembled and turned pale whenever she came in her husband's presence. The only member of the imperial family who took the poor young queen under his wing was her father-in-law, Emperor Francis I; and when Francis died shortly after her marriage, she had no real support in the court. Upon Francis I's death on 18 August 1765, Maria Josepha became Empress of the Holy Roman Empire following her husband's accession to the throne. Her mother-in-law, however, remained the most powerful and important Power figure in the Empire and at court in Vienna and Holy Roman Empire. Maria Josepha and Joseph's short-lived marriage did not produce any children, but for much of the two years of her marriage, Josepha's state of health led her and others to suppose that she was pregnant. In October 1765, in sentences delicately omitted by Arneth from a published version of a letter to his younger brother Leopold, Joseph wrote: 'As for my empress, there is no change. She has no illness but considerable disturbance. She [Josepha] maybe pregnant though without the slightest swelling. I just don't understand it, and I console myself with the happy life I lead as a bachelor husband.'Beales, p. 87 Next month, he wrote: 'I live almost as a bachelor, getting up at 6 o'clock in the morning, going to bed at 11, seeing my wife only at table and touching her only in bed.' In the same month, Josepha's mistress of the household retired, because she could no longer bear to contemplate the tableau de ce mauvais menage. Apparently, the young empress had made matters worse for herself by telling her troubles to her servants. Death Maria Josepha's tomb in the Imperial Crypt, Vienna On 28 May 1767, after only two years of marriage, Maria Josepha died of smallpox as had her predecessor Isabella. Upon the young empress' death, the Court immediately plunged into mourning. Her husband did not visit her during her illness, although her mother-in-law, Maria Theresa, did. In doing so, Maria Theresa also caught the disease, but survived. In Joseph's first reaction to receiving the news of his wife's death, he had told some of his intimates some remarks which imply regrets for the coldness he had shown to her. He further brought himself to tell his sister-in-law, Duchess Maria Antonia, that his wife had been \\"for so many reasons worthy of respect\\".Beales, p. 88 Maria Josepha was buried in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna, but Joseph did not attend her burial. The unloved young empress played a role in her husband's life once more after her death, when he laid claim to a large part of Bavaria in 1778–1779. He based his claim on, among other grounds, his marriage to his Bavarian second wife. This conflict eventually grew into the War of the Bavarian Succession. In the end, the Habsburg dynasty gained only the Innviertel.

After the Chinese Civil War, the JCRR then moved to Taiwan, where its work has been widely credited with laying the agricultural basis in the 1950s and 1960s for Taiwan's outstanding economic growth in the following decades by a coordinated program of economic, social, and technical development. The JCRR on the mainland After intensive lobbying by Y.C. James Yen, the American Congress included a provision in the China Aid Act of 1948 to fund an independent entity which would take advantage of Yen's experience in the Rural Reconstruction Movement. The JCRR was governed by five commissioners, three of whom were Chinese, appointed by the Chinese government, and two of whom were American, appointed by the American president. On the mainland, during the last days of the Chinese Civil War the JCRR carried out a program of rent reduction, guarantee of tenure security, and formation of cooperatives, in addition to expansion of the agronomic and irrigation programs. By one estimate, this was the largest non-Communist land reform program in China before 1949. The JCRR and the economic development of Taiwan With the impending defeat of the Chinese Nationalist Party, the JCRR moved to Taiwan, where under the leadership of Chiang Monlin it supervised major land reform, agricultural improvement, and education projects. Since the JCRR was funded from the United States and its salary scale was not governed by government pay schedules, the agency could offer higher pay than the government bureaucracy and attracted highly trained and capable staff. Commissioners included , a graduate of Cornell College of Agriculture. Lee Teng-hui, the future President of the Republic of China and Nationalist Party Chairman, worked as an agricultural economist for the JCRR in the early 1950s. From 1951 to 1965, around one third of US government aid to Taiwan was directed by the JCRR into agriculture, creating almost two thirds of net domestic capital formation. JCRR programs contributed directly to improving crop and animal stock, development of irrigation and flood control, soil improvement, rural credit programs and cooperatives, health programs, and birth control. The JCRR continued the strategy developed by the Rural Reconstruction Movement on the mainland of coordinating all these programs instead of running them independently one by one. Under the combined stimulus of the land reform and the agricultural development programs, production in agriculture increased at an average annual rate of 4 per cent from 1952 to 1959, greater than the growth in population, which was 3.6 percent. The JCRR is widely credited with creating the basis of agricultural prosperity which led to Taiwan's rapid economic growth in the 1970s and 1980s. JCRR was combined with the Council of Agriculture when the United States ended the official foreign relation with the Republic of China in 1979.

Classified as a transition metal alkyl complex, hexamethyltungsten is an air- sensitive, red, crystalline solid at room temperature; however, it is extremely volatile and sublimes at −30 °C. Owing to its six methyl groups it is extremely soluble in petroleum, aromatic hydrocarbons, ethers, carbon disulfide, and carbon tetrachloride. Synthesis Hexamethyltungsten was first reported in 1973 by Wilkinson and Shortland, who described its preparation by the reaction of methyllithium with tungsten hexachloride in diethyl ether. The synthesis was motivated in part by previous work which indicated that tetrahedral methyl transition metal compounds are thermally unstable, in the hopes that an octahedral methyl compound would prove to be more robust. In 1976, Wilkinson and Galyer disclosed an improved synthesis using trimethylaluminium in conjunction with trimethylamine, instead of methyllithium. The stoichiometry of the improved synthesis is as follows: :WCl6 \\\\+ 6 Al(CH3)3 → W(CH3)6 \\\\+ 6 Al(CH3)2Cl Alternatively, the alkylation can employ dimethylzinc: :WX6 \\\\+ 3 Zn(CH3)2 → W(CH3)6 \\\\+ 3 ZnX2 (X = F, Cl) Molecular geometry W(CH3)6 adopts a distorted trigonal prismatic geometry with C3v symmetry for the WC6 framework and C3 symmetry including the hydrogen atoms. The structure (excluding the hydrogen atoms) can be thought of as consisting of a central atom, capped on either side by two eclipsing sets of three carbon atoms, with one triangular set slightly larger but also closer to the central atom than the other. The trigonal prismatic geometry is unusual in that the vast majority of six-coordinate organometallic compounds adopt octahedral molecular geometry. In the initial report, the IR spectroscopy results were interpreted in terms of an octahedral structure. In 1978, a study using photoelectron spectroscopy appeared to confirm the initial assignment of an Oh structure. The octahedral assignment remained for nearly 20 years until 1989 when Girolami and Morse showed that was trigonal prismatic as indicated by X-ray crystallography. They predicted that other d0 ML6 species such as , , and W(CH3)6 would also prove to be trigonal prismatic. This report prompted other investigations into the structure of W(CH3)6. Using gas-phase electron diffraction, Volden et al. confirmed that W(CH3)6 is indeed trigonal prismatic structure with either D3h or C3v symmetry. In 1996, Seppelt et al. reported that W(CH3)6 had a strongly distorted trigonal prismatic coordination geometry based on single-crystal X-ray diffraction, which they later confirmed in 1998. As shown in the top figure at right, the ideal or D3h trigonal prism in which all six carbon atoms are equivalent is distorted to the C3v structure observed by Seppelt et al. by opening up one set of three methyl groups (upper triangle) to wider C-W-C angles (94-97°) with slightly shorter C-W bond lengths, while closing the other set of three methyls (lower triangle) to 75-78° with longer bond lengths. Deviation from octahedral geometry can be ascribed to an effect known as a second-order Jahn-Teller distortion. In 1995, before the work of Seppelt and Pfennig, Landis and coworkers had already predicted a distorted trigonal prismatic structure based on valence bond theory and VALBOND calculations. The history of the structure of W(CH3)6 illustrates an inherent difficulty in interpreting spectral data for new compounds: initial data may not provide reason to believe the structure deviates from a presumed geometry based on significant historical precedence, but there is always the possibility that the initial assignment will prove to be incorrect. Prior to 1989, there was no reason to suspect that ML6 compounds were anything but octahedral, yet new evidence and improved characterization methods suggested that perhaps there were exceptions to the rule, as evidenced by the case of W(CH3)6. These discoveries helped to spawn re-evaluation of the theoretical considerations for ML6 geometries. Other 6-coordinate complexes with distorted trigonal prismatic structures include [MoMe6], , and . All are d0 complexes. Some 6-coordinate complexes with regular trigonal prismatic structures (D3h symmetry) include [ReMe6] (d1), (d0), and the aforementioned (d0). Reactivity and potential uses At room temperature, hexamethyltungsten decomposes, releasing methane and trace amounts of ethane. The black residue is purported to contain polymethylene and tungsten, but the decomposition of W(CH3)6 to form tungsten metal is highly unlikely. The following equation is the approximate stoichiometry proposed by Wilkinson and Shortland: : → 3 + + W Like many organometallic complexes, WMe6 is destroyed by oxygen. Similarly, acids give methane and unidentified tungsten derivatives, while halogens give the methyl halide and leave the tungsten halide. A patent application was submitted in 1991 suggesting the use of W(CH3)6 in the manufacture of semiconductor devices for chemical vapor deposition of tungsten thin films; however, to date it has not been used for this purpose. Rather, tungsten hexafluoride and hydrogen are used instead. Treatment of W(CH3)6 with F2 diluted with Ne at −90 °C affords W(CF3)6 in 50% yield as an extremely volatile white solid. Hexamethyltungsten(VI) reacts with trimethylphosphine in light petroleum to give WMe6(PMe3), which in neat PMe3, with U.V. irradiation gives the carbyne complex trans-WMe(:::CMe)(PMe3)4 in high yield. Safety considerations Serious explosions have been reported as a result of working with W(CH3)6, even in the absence of air.

It is in the Anand district, situated at 22°33′N 72°43′E. Its nearest villages are Isnav (4 km away), Dabhou (6 km away), Gada (4 km), Devataj (2 km), and Limbali (3 km). The village is home to several schools, including Smt. H.J. Patel Primary School for Girls, inaugurated by the Governor of Gujarat in 2006 and The M.M. High School and Library. Sojitra also has a number of temples dedicated to different deities of Hindu and Jain faiths.Dabhou official website, retrieved 21 August 2008 Sojitra is place of Digamber jain panch. Once it was a town village located nearby Khambhat. When Khambhat was a major port on the confluence of Mahi Sagar, highways emerging from Khambhat passed through Sojitra to far away hinter lands. This had made Sojitra an important industrial center. It was the hub of businessmen, money lenders and famous artisans. The ponds (kund), step well, Jain temples, Buddha statues, Masjid of the village still provide a glimpse of its glorious past and antiquity. The statues found during the excavation of the pond traces the existence of the village as far back as second century BC according to the archaeologists.https://anand.nic.in/places-of-interest History Ancient documents and archaeological surveys indicate that Sojitra is an ancient town that has experienced several name changes and been under the control of many different political entities. Popular mythology of the area credits the current incarnation of the village as originally being settled by Sojan Rabari and his family, who named it either Sojanpur or Sojatypur. At some point, this was shortened to Soja, which later morphed into the current name. Virabhai Patel is the father of Sojitra as to the recorded fact from 1116 AC and the descendants. Interesting find in time lineage of King Prithviraj Chauhan (1149–1192 CE), in reference to Solanki Raj BhimDev, our ancestors settled during this period in Davataj and ViraBhai bought the land Davataj from Bhimdev Solanki in this period. The village proper itself was mostly settled and established by family members of the Patel family line. In 1527, when the immediate area was under the control of Raval rulers, Surabhai Patel left Chapaner and moved to Adalaj and again in 1552 with one of his two sons, Virabhai Patel, to Devataj. In 1575, Muzfarshah the Second, allotted the land of Sojitra to Jeshangbhai Patel, the son of Virarabhai Patel, for hereditary use. The land was distributed among seven inheritors: Harakhjibhai, Sunderbhai, Bhuderbhai, Saudasbhai, Meghabhai, Amabaidas and Mahibhai Pragdas (Mahibhai Pragdas are brothers). The Patidars of the seven Khadkies were their descendants. Above all, the most notable and prodigal son of Sojitra is Dr Yogendra Kumar Makwana, who went to become home minister in Mrs Indira Gandhi's cabinet. He held various portfolios ranging from home to communications, steel and mines in Mrs Gandhi as well as Rajiv Gandhi's cabinet. Born to a middle-school head master belonging to the vankar community of the scheduled castes, he studied law and practiced in the Gujarat High Court before becoming a member of Rajya Sabha in the year 1973. He made many contributions to the upliftment of the depressed classes, notably among them is the revival of the special component plan of the government of India. The Patel family has also produced a number of individuals who have been influential in the Indian government. In the state of Gujarat, Shri Bhaikaka the Founder of Vallabh Vidhya Nagar, Kamalaben Maganbhai Patel held the position of Deputy Minister of the State; Dr. Thakorbhai Patel was Cabinet Minister of the State of Gujarat; and Ravajibhai Maganbhai Patel served as Secretary of the Gujarat Congress Committee. In the state of Bombay, Dr. Bhaskarbhai Patel was the Deputy Minister of the State; and Jashbhai Jivabhai Patel served as the Controller of Iron & Steel. In the national government, Gopalbhai Shivabhai Patel was the Chairman of the Unit Trust of India; and Chimanbhai Patel was the Chief Engineer of the Public Works Department of the Government of India.

The four teams included the host United States, Mexico, Bolivia and Guatemala. This year, Guatemala was making its first and only appearance in the cup, Bolivia was playing in its second cup and Mexico was appearing for the third time, having won the last two editions, in 1996 and 1997. Mexico would win again this year, for its third consecutive title. While in previous years, the U.S. cup featured four teams in a round robin tournament, with the team having the best record claiming the title, this year USSF elected to use a two-game double header format. The winners of the first two games met for the title in the first game of the second doubleheader while the losers in the first two games played each other in the second doubleheader's later game. March 11: first doubleheader In the first game of the 1999 Nike U.S. Cup, the U.S. defeated Guatemala 3-1. Coming into the match, seven of the U.S. starters had five or less caps. This showed in the early going as Guatemala controlled the run of play. However, the U.S. slowly regained its composure and using its strength in the air, began to send high balls into the Guatemala area. Ante Razov, Ben Olsen and Brian McBride all had headers saved by Guatemala keeper Edgar Estrada in the first half. The first goal of the game came in the 22d minute when Ben Olsen sent a cross into the area from the right. Brian McBride headed the ball towards the front of the goal where Joe- Max Moore quickly blasted into the top of the goal. In the 37th minute, McBride headed in a cross from Razov to give the U.S. a comfortable 2-0 lead going into halftime. However, the Guatemalans came out looking to score and finally found the net after Eddie Lewis took down Guillermo Ortega in the penalty area. Jorge Perez took the penalty kick and put it past U.S. keeper Zach Thornton. As the score remained 2-1, Guatemalan frustrations boiled over and Erick Miranda hacked at Joe-Max Moore in the box approaching the 90th minute. Moore turned around and retaliated only to find both himself and Miranda ejected. Both would miss the second game of the cup. As the victor, the U.S. would go on to the title game against the winner of the second game of the day. United States: Zach Thornton, Jeff Agoos, Carlos Llamosa, C.J.

In the first game, the U.S. and Mexico met for the title. The game turned against the U.S. in the 17th minute. José Manuel Abundis carried the ball down the left side of the field before sending a cross in towards Francisco Palencia. U.S. defender Robin Fraser closed on Palencia, but Fraser slipped and the cross ran off his body into the net for an own goal. In the melee in front of the goal, Palencia struck U.S. starting goalkeeper Tony Meola in the face, putting him out of the game. While Meola and U.S. coach Bruce Arena later argued that Palencia had deliberately struck Meola in the face, no foul was called and the goal counted. The goal held until the 51st minute when Frankie Hejduk scored his second goal of the tournament with a first time shot off a Fraser cross. However, Mexico struck back six minutes later when Joel Sanchez shot from 12 yards out. Backup U.S. keeper Zach Thornton blocked the shot, but the rebound went to Abundis who scored from two yards out. The U.S. pressed for an equalizer, but Mexico's defense held and Mexico took the game and the 1999 Nike U.S. Cup title.

In 1907, when Oklahoma became a state, it was decided that Elk should be renamed because the mail kept getting mixed up with Elk City, and so a town meeting was called. Three possible names were chosen and sent to Washington, DC: JJ Eaves, a prominent rancher, LO Majors, the owner of the General Store, and Elzy R Poole, a pioneer rancher. After a time, Washington DC notified them that Elk, Oklahoma would now be called Pooleville. E.S. Poole was actually Edward Poole and was the son of Elzy R. Poole, in 1907 he was only 19 years old and so it is doubtful that he would be a prominent banker at that time. On June 8, 1894, a sheriff's posse from Anadarko caught and killed William M.

Sibrel made this video as a follow- up to his 2001 video A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon, which accuses NASA of falsifying the Apollo 11 mission photography. The title of the presentation is a wordplay on the Girls Gone Wild video series. Encounters with astronauts In Astronauts Gone Wild, Sibrel confronts nine Apollo astronauts and asks them to swear an oath on a Bible that they traveled to the Moon and back. =Buzz Aldrin= Sibrel's first encounter is with the Apollo 11 crewmember Buzz Aldrin. Inside an office room, he shows Aldrin his \\"secret\\" footage, which Sibrel says was sent to him by mistake from NASA. According to Sibrel, this footage shows the crew rigging a shot inside their spacecraft to appear halfway to the Moon, when they were really in Earth orbit and trying to deceive the world. Early 2007 listing of video titles available from director. Aldrin dismisses Sibrel's arguments, stating \\"We went to the Moon; we're not misleading anybody.\\" Later in the video, Sibrel confronts Aldrin on another occasion, this time in September 2002 in Beverly Hills, California. The confrontational video maker makes his Bible demand. The astronaut refuses and tries his best to get away from Sibrel, who follows Aldrin and calls him \\"a coward, and a liar, and a thief.\\" Aldrin then punches (visually described as a right overhand) Sibrel on camera. This incident, which made international headlines at the time, is the best-known response he received from one of the Apollo astronauts about his conspiracy belief. In a radio interview, Sibrel stated that he blames himself for provoking Aldrin to punch him. He claims to have sent Aldrin a letter of apology. = Other astronauts = As shown in the video, Sibrel also was able to interview astronauts Alan Bean, Eugene Cernan and Edgar Mitchell about the Apollo project. Bean, for instance, states that the \\"all-up\\" testing of the Saturn V rocket cut months off the schedule and was an impetus in reaching the Moon before decade's end. Cernan describes an experiment on his Moon mission, Apollo 17, that was specifically designed to study the radiation of the Van Allen radiation belts. The interviews end with the request to swear an oath on Sibrel's Bible. He asks them to \\"swear and affirm, under penalty of eternal damnation, perjury and treason\\" that the astronauts really went to the Moon. Cernan and Mitchell testify that they did indeed walk on the Moon, taking the whole oath as Sibrel states it to them. Alan Bean is also willing to swear on Sibrel's Bible, though Sibrel shows him as unwilling to swear under penalty of treason. Later, Mitchell had the following to say about his encounter: \\"Sibrel faked his way into my home with false History Channel credentials for an interview. After about 3–4 minutes, he popped the bible question. Realizing who he was, I maintained my cool enough to swear on his bible, then ended the interview and tossed him out of the house, with a boot in his rear.\\" The other astronauts Sibrel confronts are Michael Collins, Alfred Worden, Bill Anders, John Young and Neil Armstrong. Sibrel did not arrange formal interviews with any of these men, instead accosting them at public events to make his Bible request. For the most part, these astronauts do the best they can to avoid him as soon as they find out that he supports the conspiracy theory. He confronts Armstrong at a meeting of stockholders in New York City. During interviews for the biography, regarding the hoax claims, Armstrong said, \\"It doesn't bother me. It will all pass in time.\\"Hansen 2005, pp. 634–637 The Apollo 11 commander refused to go along with his demands and states, \\"Mr. Sibrel, you do not deserve answers.\\" Meanwhile, Worden tells Sibrel that his claims of a falsified mission are \\"totally nonsense.\\" He says that he has no problem swearing on the Bible of his trip to the Moon, but that he does not feel he needs to do so.

It has been associated with the historical Liqian and Fanhe counties. The village of Zhelaizhai, located in Jiaojiazhuang township, has been the subject of international academic and media attention for its potential connection to Sino-Roman relations.  History  The ancient Northern Silk Road passes through Yongchang County; numerous Han envoys were sent west along this trackway, some parties exceeding 100 members, late in the first millennium BC. The Han dynasty sent one mission to Parthia, which was reciprocated around 100 BC: Roman emissaries were captured by the Chinese in 30 BC along the Silk Road at Yongchang. At various times during the 20th century and early 21st century, the county has entered the sight of media because some of the inhabitants of Jiaojiazhuang township's Liqian village () (Zhelaizhai), located where the ancient Liqian county had existed in the early imperial period (Western Han dynasty to Sui dynasty), have been theorized to be descendants of a Roman legion. Although this story has been seized upon by enthusiastic Chinese of the area and non-specialist Westerners, at least two eminent Chinese authorities have shown that the notion has serious shortcomings.  Administrative divisions  In 1996, Yongchang County was made up of four towns and six townships. In 2000, Dongzhai township and Shuiyuan township both became towns. Since that change, Yongchang County has been made up of the following six towns and four townships: Six towns: *Chengguan (), Hexibu (), Xinchengzi (), Zhuwangbu (), Dongzhai (), Shuiyuan () Four townships: *Hongshanyao (), Jiaojiazhuang (), Liuba (), Nanba ()  Transport  *China National Highway 312 Gallery File:Yongchang, Jinchang, Gansu, China - panoramio (5).jpgLocal mural File:Yongchang, Jinchang, Gansu, China - panoramio (14).jpgLocal landscape File:Yongchang, Jinchang, Gansu, China - panoramio (29).jpgYongchang Service Area () File:Yongchang, Jinchang, Gansu, China - panoramio (25).jpgLocal landscape  References   External links  * Category:County-level divisions of Gansu Category:Jinchang ","title":"Yongchang County"},{"id":"9479473","text":"Lama () is an Upazila of Bandarban District in the Division of Chittagong, Bangladesh.

It breeds in parts of Mongolia and China, migrating southwards each year to spend its non-breeding season in Indonesia, New Guinea and northern Australia.  Description  Adult male in breeding plumage: white face, throat and fore- crown; grey-brown hind-crown, hind-neck and back; belly white, demarcated with narrow black band and then broad chestnut breast band merging into white throat. Female, juvenile and non-breeding male: generally grey-brown upperparts and white belly; pale face with white streak above eye. Measurements: length 21–25 cm; wingspan 46–53 cm; weight 95 g. Among the redbreasted Charadrius plovers, this bird is relatively large, longlegged and long-winged.  Distribution and habitat Breeds in Mongolia, eastern Russia and Manchuria; migrates through eastern China and South-East Asia to Indonesia and northern Australia. Rare in New Guinea; straggler to New Zealand and Europe three times (Finland, Norway and Sweden). The oriental plover breeds in dry steppes, deserts, arid grasslands and saltpans. Its non-breeding habitat includes grasslands, salt-fields and coastal areas.  Food  The oriental plover feeds mainly on insects.  Breeding  The breeding of this bird has not been much studied but it nests on the ground.  Conservation  About 90% of the oriental plovers that make the long journey south overwinter in Australia and it has been estimated that there may be 160,000 individuals of this species. With a large range and no evidence of significant population decline, this species’ conservation status is rated by the IUCN as being of Least Concern.

The park and zoo were listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. The zoo exhibits more than 220 animals of 90 species originating throughout the world. Under the zoo's new assessment and initiatives plan, the zoo is being modernized so animals are exhibited in natural settings, surrounded by botanical plantings. Among the exhibits are grizzly bears and Bengal tigers. The Castle building exhibits various educational species like fennec fox, corn snakes, and a living beehive. The Winged Wonders has a walk through aviary. The Farm exhibits miniature domestic horses, donkeys, pigs, and goats which may be fed by guests. History In 1925, a retired animal trainer moved his brown bear \\"Jake\\" to the Washington Park lakefront in the hopes that the bear would get more visitors in the park and not be so isolated. Some additional animals and birds were brought to the park by the fire department, which at the time occasionally sheltered abandoned exotic animals, and the city had the beginnings of a zoo. Planning for a zoo board started in 1927, and the first board was appointed by City Manager Albert R. Couden in 1928. Hopes were that the zoo would provide recreation and education not only for residents of Michigan City but also to the thousands who spent their summers at nearby resorts. Washington Park Zoo Tower — The stone lookout tower was designed by Fred Ahlgrim in an Art Deco style. The zoo was moved to its current location in the sand dunes overlooking the lake, and the zoo board began building new exhibits using only \\"scrounged\\" and donated materials. With the advent of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA), that Civil Works Administration (CWA), and later the Works Progress Administration (WPA), the zoo was completely redesigned. It is believed to be the only zoo in Indiana completely designed and landscaped by these agencies, with the WPA supplying labor as long as the zoo board could find the materials. Eleven buildings in the zoo are on the National Register of Historic Places. Monkey Island was completed in 1934. This was an island with a surrounding moat, a high exterior wall, an access tunnel for the animals from their indoor enclosures. Currently, the island houses a family of Ringtail lemurs and there are plans to renovate the exhibit in the future. An observation tower east of the zoo that overlooks the lake, and the \\"castle\\" that houses small mammals followed by 1937. The tower is a creation of a steel faced with limestone and the roof is topped with a spherical ornament reported to be a compression chamber from the city's first fire engine. A feline house was constructed in 1977 using artificial artwork to create more naturalistic surroundings for the animals. A new elephant house opened in 1978 and housed the zoo's elephants until 1990 when a decision was made to stop exhibiting them, and the building was converted into an education facility. The three elephants resident at that time were relocated to the North Carolina Zoo, Have Trunk Will Travel, and the Riddles Elephant and Wildlife Sanctuary. In 2004, the zoo opened a new main entrance, a new gift shop and initiated repairs on the observation tower and the walk-through aviary (2005), opened the North American Carnivore exhibit with grizzly bears, mountain lion, and river otters (2007), and opened the Avian Adventure exhibit (2009) where visitors can feed parakeets and cockatiels. Animals The zoo generally houses about 250 animals representing between 85 and 100 species. Several are Species Survival Plan (SSP) animals, members of designated endangered species groups. The zoo also acts as a sanctuary for misplaced or illegally obtained wild pets from the area and takes in local animals too injured to survive in the wild. Landscaping The landscaping for the zoo and park was initially a major focus. The original building was supplied with watering systems that could provide the water necessary for the sand dune environment of the zoo, and with plants provided by city greenhouses, the landscaping was often as much of an attraction as the animals. Starting in 1994, many of the existing flower beds were replanted or redesigned, while other areas of the zoo have been replanted to attract native birds and insects, or to provide dietary enrichment for the animals.

The prize is awarded by Mifal HaPayis (Israel's state lottery), and is a part of the organization's cultural initiatives. It bears the name of the late Pinhas Sapir, a former Finance Minister of Israel, and was first awarded in 2000.  Prize money  The Sapir Prize, based on the British Man Booker Prize, is the most lucrative literary prize awarded in Israel. Of five shortlisted titles, the winning author receives 150,000 NIS (roughly 39,000 USD), and the four runners-up each receive 40,000 NIS. For the year 2019, a new award will be granted for a debut work. Up to three candidates will receive a prize of 20,000 NIS, with the winner receiving 40,000 NIS.  Prize rules  The group of judges for the prize is composed of prominent literary figures, whose names are kept confidential until the prize winner is named. Some of these judges are replaced from year to year. The judges first select five books published during the previous year as final contestants for the prize. These books are selected from a list of books provided by the major publishing houses. After a number of weeks, a winner is chosen from these five books and is publicised during Israel's Hebrew Book Week. The five finalist authors participate in a round of literary get-togethers with readers throughout Israel with the backing of Israel's state lottery. In 2005, the state lottery ran a competition allowing readers to bet on the winner of the prize; the first 30 people to guess the winner correctly received the five finalist books. In 2003, author Etgar Keret's book of short stories Anihu was disqualified from competing for the prize after it was discovered that the regulations required all competing books to run at least 60,000 words. This rule has since been abolished. In 2006, in response to many petitions, the prize's management decided to open up the competition to works published in the previous five years which had been translated into Hebrew from other languages. All competing authors must be Israeli citizens. The change was intended to allow Israeli authors writing in Russian, Arabic, English, and additional languages to compete. These authors can compete either in the normal prize track, or in a separate track specifically for translated works, from which only one work is selected. Prizewinners are given funding to have their work translated into Arabic and one other foreign language. The prize's awarding ceremony is broadcast every year on television during Israel's Hebrew Book Week. In 2015 the prize rules were changed, only residents of Israel are eligible. Criticism The Sapir Prize has been criticized on the grounds that it is given to bestsellers. Some of the country's most important writers refuse to submit their candidacy for it, including Meir Shalev, Aharon Appelfeld, A.B. Yehoshua and Amos Oz. In 2014, for the first time, the award was won by a writer (Reuven Namdar) living outside Israel. Thereafter, it was decided that only candidates resident in Israel would be eligible to submit their works for the prize. Critics of this decision have said that for a language to isolate itself, and to restrict its literature to local concerns, is to stifle it. However, others have argued that literary funding is in short supply in Israel, and would be best directed at local authors rather than those living more comfortably abroad.

The song details a number of characters living in New York City, including Teenage Mary, Margarita Passion, Seasick Sarah, and Beardless Harry, all of whom are detailed using or seeking drugs. In addition to mentioning New York scenery such as Union Square and 47th Street, the song makes use of drug terms paired with religious imagery.

In the song, Marguerita Passion tried to sell her soul in order to get \\"a fix\\", while Seasick Sarah \\"turned blue\\", causing her angels to panic.

Radio Waitaki began broadcasting on 1395AM on 5 July 1980, with the late John \\"JR\\" Ramsay behind the microphone. The station was originally a commercial station operated by the government owned Radio New Zealand and used the callsign 4ZW. Hosts included Russ Leadley, Tony Dudley, Charles Pierard, Mike Yardley, Scott Radovanovich, Luke Spittle, Steve Jukes, Mike Plant, Lana Searle, Sarah Van Der Kley, Dave Nicholas, Joel Palmer, Becky Morgan, Finley Brentwood and Sam Wilson. Past station managers include Lyall Flett (first manager), Chris Rowland, Roy Woodward, Phil Gully, Phil Stephens, Stella Nicholson, Nigel Newberry, Dan Lewis, Aaron Gillions and Gary Watling. In July 1996 the New Zealand Government sold off the commercial arm of Radio New Zealand, the sale included Radio Waitaki. The new owner was The Radio Network, a subsidiary of APN News & Media and Clear Channel Communications, which operated as a division of the Australian Radio Network. In 1998 The Radio Network grouped all their local stations in smaller markets together to form the Community Radio Network. Radio Waitaki continued to run a local breakfast show between 6am and 10am but outside breakfast all stations part of the Community Radio Network took network programming from a central studio based in Taupo. In 2001 the Community Radio Network was discontinued and all stations become part of the Classic Hits FM network, as a result Radio Waitaki was rebranded as Classic Hits Radio Waitaki. The station continued to run a local breakfast but now outside breakfast all programming originated from the Classic Hits studios in Auckland. A short time later Classic Hits began broadcasting on 98.4 FM, with the original 1395AM frequency becoming Newstalk ZB. On 28 April 2014 all stations part of the Classic Hits network were rebranded as The Hits. A networked breakfast presented by Pauline Gillespie and Grant Kareama was introduced to almost all The Hits stations with the former breakfast announcer moved to present a 6-hour show between 9am and 3pm. The local 9am-3pm show was originally presented by Josh McIntyre, in 2014 Josh was moved to Timaru to present the same show for both The Hits in Timaru and Oamaru. With Polly and Grant leaving The Hits in 2017 all South Island stations reverted to local breakfast programming, today The Hits in Oamaru takes the Dunedin-based breakfast show.

Smith column, 2000, 'Buffalo Jim' even manages to make litigation colorful Career Barrier moved to Las Vegas in 1971 from Cleveland, Ohio. He later opened an auto repair shop, Allstate Auto & Marine, on Industrial Road, near the Las Vegas Strip. The business was in operation until his death in 2008. In the 1980s and 1990s, he opened and operated a wrestling school, the Buffalo Wrestling Federation. The school was sometimes the site of his popular local TV show, Jim Wars, that aired on Friday nights. In addition to his auto repair business, wrestling school, and television show, Barrier wrote a weekly column on auto repair for the now defunct Las Vegas Mercury entitled “Nuts and Bold with Buffalo Jim.” As a wrestling promoter, auto repair specialist, and entrepreneur, Barrier befriended numerous celebrities. Among them are Hulk Hogan, the Undertaker, boxer Muhammad Ali, and wrestling and film star Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. Barrier also possessed a large collection of celebrity memorabilia, from vehicles to a lock of musician Elvis Presley’s hair. In addition to smaller pieces in his collection, Barrier also sported a car collection that included a Jensen Interceptor once owned by singer Wayne Newton and a pink Cadillac that was later borrowed by musician Kid Rock as part of his proposal to Pamela Anderson in Las Vegas in 2002. Personal life In 2005, Barrier was voted “Las Vegas’ Most Colorful Character” by the Las Vegas Review Journal, describing him as “a modern Renaissance man.” He was also single father of four daughters. Legal dispute Barrier was known in Las Vegas, because of media coverage, for winning a lengthy court dispute about parking spacesRick Porrello's - AmericanMafia.com - Steve Miller - Inside Vegas with his neighbor and landlord, Rick Rizzolo, former owner of the Crazy Horse Too gentlemen's club, located next door to Barrier's repair shop.

He was working with real estate professionals to secure a new location before he died.Las Vegas Citylife, \\"An unlikely hero, a strange death\\" Death On the morning of April 6, 2008, the body of James Barrier was found in a Motel 6 on Boulder Highway, an older section of Las Vegas near a residential area. According to police, Barrier was found lying in bed, face up, with an empty prescription bottle of Valium on the nightstand and his pants pulled down around his ankles. A woman only known as \\"Lisa\\" that was in the room with Barrier that night told police that Barrier had a seizure, however she did not report it at the time and left as his seizure occurred. The official cause of death was ruled accidental, citing dilated cardiomyopathy. Between April 2008 and June 2008, statements by then-Clark County Coroner Michael Murphy, also stated traces of cocaine in Barrier’s toxicology reports as a contributing factor to his death. Additionally, 20 mg of GHB in Barrier’s system, but was not seen as a factor leading to his death.  Suspicion of foul play  While Barrier's death was ruled accidental by officials, friends and family have publicly stated that Barrier's death was a murder and remains unsolved. Barrier's supporters and loved ones point to the following as evidence of foul play: = Release of Rick Rizzolo from prison = The Las Vegas Review Journal observed the following: \\"Barrier assisted the federal government in its investigation into tax evasion at Crazy Horse Too. Rizzolo pleaded guilty to tax evasion charges and spent one year and one day in custody. He was formally released April 4, two days before Barrier was found dead.\\" With Barrier's death coming so soon after the release of Rizzolo (a man with whom Barrier had numerous battles in court with over parking spaces, the obstacle of his auto shop interrupting Rizzolo's expansion plans, and Barrier's close work with the FBI prior to Rizzolo's trial and imprisonment), family and friends have speculated that Barrier's death is related to the release of the owner of the notorious club. =Death threats= In the weeks and days before his death, Barrier had received death threats via phone and letters addressed to his auto repair shop. On April 5, 2008, the day before his death, Barrier stated he received a phone call from someone identifying himself as a hitman and threatened to kill him. In a first-person article for Las Vegas Weekly, journalist and Barrier friend Joshua Longobardy included a conversation he’d had with Barrier before Barrier's death: > [Barrier] had already been on high alert. His concerns for his safety had > exacerbated with the knowledge that Rick Rizzolo, the former owner of the > Crazy Horse Too gentlemen’s club, who federal authorities allege has ties > with organized crime families, and against whom Barrier helped solidify a > federal case that resulted in a one-year prison sentence, had been released > to the free world the day before. For this reason Barrier had also called me > on Friday evening. Earlier in the day he had received a phone call from a > self-described hit man, and though Barrier didn’t believe anyone would > attack him face to face, he did express concern about an alternative form of > attack. Because I spoke to Barrier on a weekly basis, and because I had > always known him to be a sensible man, I deemed his worries generally valid, > and told him so. “Be aware of ambushes,” I said. He countered by stating his > presentiment that his enemies—in name, the Rizzolo family and their > associates—would try to get him through a stratagem. “They’re gonna try to > do it through a woman,” he said. “Or they’re gonna try to drug me.” Days after Barrier was found dead, Gus Flangas, an acquaintance and attorney for Barrier, was quoted in the Las Vegas Review Journal saying, \\"All I can say is the circumstances (surrounding Barrier’s death) seem suspicious; obviously it will warrant further investigation.\\" =Auto shop break-in= A break-in occurred at Barrier's auto shop the day Rizzolo was released from prison. Nothing was taken, but a sheet of paper containing his home address was prominently displayed on his desk, amid the refuse. Friends and family theorize that this was a statement being made that someone was telling Barrier that they knew where he lived. =Missing vehicle= The keys to Barrier’s Rolls Royce were in the room with him. However, the car was not seen in the parking lot when his two youngest daughters were brought to the room at the Motel 6 to identify his body. The vehicle, which he had driven from his home to the Motel 6, was originally owned by casino developer Bob Stupak and was seized by Barrier after non-payment by Stupak for repair services. After the Barrier family questioned police about the whereabouts of the Rolls Royce, it was later found in the Motel 6 parking lot in an area that had been previously searched and did not originally contain his vehicle. It has also been cleaned.  Independent Autopsy and Coroner Investigation  Despite concerns voiced by the family and friends of James Barrier, the Clark County Coroner and Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department investigators did not suspect foul play in the death of Barrier. It was also stated by police officials that fingerprints were never taken at the scene of Barrier's death. A preliminary report to Barrier's family stated there were no signs of drugs or a heart attack in Barrier's body A later autopsy report later stated that Barrier died of dilated cardiomyopathy (inflamed heart muscles). The Las Vegas Review Journal reported the following from then-Clark County Coroner Michael Murphy, DBA: > \\"Simms’ preliminary report indicated there were no signs of a heart attack, > fueling the family’s belief that Barrier died under suspicious > circumstances. Murphy said that when an individual dies from a heart attack, > the heart muscle is dead. Barrier had no dead muscles but had heart disease. > In medical terms, he died from a heart disease combined with cocaine use, > Murphy said, clarifying Simms’ findings.\\" Not satisfied with the findings of the Clark County Coroner, Barrier’s family hired independent pathologist Dr. Rexene Worrell to perform an autopsy. Barrier’s family was promised photographs, video, audio, and notes documenting the examination upon completion of the autopsy. Once completed, however, Worrell declined to provide the family with the findings, saying, “I need to hold on to the file in case it goes to court.” As of 2018, 10 years after the independent autopsy, the information obtained by Worrell concerning Barrier’s body had yet to be released to the family. In an effort to determine if Barrier had a recent history of drug use, Barrier's family requested that his body be exhumed to test hair samples from his body for drugs. The Clark County Coroner's office stated they had no plans to exhume Barrier's body and that such an action could only be done at the request of law enforcement for a criminal prosecution. Funeral and burial Barrier's funeral was on April 12, 2008 at the Palm Downtown Mortuary and Cemetery. The following is a description of the mourners who came to show their respects: > Before he was to be buried, four weeks ago, the great multitudes filed into > the Palms Mortuary in the old part of Las Vegas to see Buffalo Jim Barrier > one final time. They arrived in endless droves: midgets, wrestlers, Hells > Angels, Native American Indians of unadulterated descent, lawyers, > journalists, world-renowned neurosurgeons—the lame and the > homeless—politicians, bankers, television executives, men who had more money > than God, boxers, leviathans, Elvis impersonators, those like Buffalo who > fixed cars and who arrived with fresh grease smeared across their jumpsuits, > sinners, celebrities, folks as old as Vegas itself and young babes just born > into the city this Spring. Barrier’s grave is located at the Palm Downtown Cemetery at 36.184451, -115.135685.

Ted Pooley's greatest claim to fame is that he should have been England's first Test match wicket-keeper. The story is a good one, but it overshadows the fact that he played cricket for Surrey and Middlesex between 1861 and 1883, and was held in the highest regard for his cricketing ability if not for his personal behaviour. The first Test gambling scandal In 1877 a representative England side was touring New Zealand and then Australia. Every match was an occasion for gambling by supporters of both sides and most games had a prize purse to play for. Pooley was injured and travelled ahead of the team to recuperate before a match in Christchurch, New Zealand. Another visitor, Ralph Donkin, offered odds of 20–1 to anyone who guessed the exact score of a batsman. The game was to be an Odds match where the England XI would play 22 of Christchurch and Pooley simply put a shilling on each batsman to make 0. He stood to make a pound for each duck scored for an initial stake of 22 shillings (£1.10). He also apparently umpired during the match. After the match – which featured 11 scores of 0 – Pooley claimed £9 15s from Donkin who refused to pay. It was Pooley's alleged assault on Donkin that led to his arrest at Dunedin (after another match in which Pooley played). He was sent for trial at Christchurch, just before the England team left for Australia and what would subsequently be recognised as the first Test match. Eventually he was found not guilty (along with the England team's bag man Alfred Bramhall) and returned to England several weeks after his fellow tourists. The story goes that the people of Christchurch held a public subscription and bought him a pocket watch. It was not the first time he had been in trouble with authority figures. He was well known as a drinker and a gambler. In 1873 he had been suspended by Surrey for taking a bet on a match he was playing in. Sporting career All this detracts from his long and successful career as a professional cricketer. By his own account he first kept wicket during a match in 1863 when the regular keeper refused to play on a bad pitch (Middlesex had been dismissed for 20). He was an instant success and kept wicket for Middlesex and Surrey for the next 20 years. Wicket-keeping was very different in the nineteenth century. Most keepers stood up to all but the fastest bowlers with a fielder behind them at long-stop to tidy up any byes. Pooley often used his bare hands to catch the ball. At one point he used a bare hand and one soft glove. According to David Frith in The Fast Men, at an unspecified date (probably before 1871) Jem Mace, the boxer, was watching cricket at Lords when a ball hit a crack in the pitch and took out three of wicket-keeper Ted Pooley's teeth. He dressed Pooley's wounds and declared: \\"I would rather stand up against any man in England for an hour than take your place behind the wicket for five minutes. I heard that ball strike you as if it had hit a brick wall.\\" In 1871 he broke a finger taking a return from a fielder and the bone protruded from his flesh. His batting, which was very promising in his early years was increasingly hampered by injuries to his hands. On 21 August 1878, against Kent at Oval, Pooley made his eighth stumping of the match, then a record in first-class cricket. His wicket- keeping was fundamental to the success of spin bowlers like James Southerton. Off-spin and orthodox left-arm spin were recent developments following the legalisation of overarm bowling in 1864 and were a puzzle for keepers as well as batsmen. Including catches made when not keeping wicket, he finished with 854 dismissals in first-class matches. Retirement After his cricket career, Pooley, as with so many of his contemporary cricketers, struggled financially and his gambling and drinking eventually led to the Lambeth workhouse. In 1899 the writer Alfred Pullin traced and interviewed many old cricketers. He described Pooley's hands as \\"mere lumps of deformity\\" and attributed their condition to rheumatism caused by drink. Pooley became angry at this, banging the table to show he had no feeling in his fingers and that it was cricket rather than \\"rheumatics\\" that had put him in the workhouse. He took Pullin outside to show he could still catch a ball. Pooley lived on until 1907, dying in poverty, while his teammates from the 1877 tour were lauded as the first Test cricketers. His brother, Frederick Pooley, also played first- class cricket. Further reading *Keith Booth, His Own Enemy: The Rise and Fall of Edward Pooley, Belmont Books, 2000, .

Sharane Sri Danamma Devi is worshipped as an incarnation of Goddess Parvati. shri.shiva sharani Danamma Devi originally called as \\"lingamma\\" was born to anantaraya and shirasamma in Maharashtra in a small city (grama) of \\"umarani\\" in jatta taluk which is 20 miles to the west of bijapur district.Further she was inspired by the Lingayat culture worshipping lord shiva came to Kalyana. Jagajyoti Basavanna forthtold her that you will be worshipped throughout the world by the name \\"Danamma sharani\\".From then on lingamma is popularly called and worshipped as Danamma. She started solving the problems of people in kalyana. After the period of Kalyana Kranti she turned to her birthplace to her parents leading her life worshiping \\"LINGA\\".She was married to a devotee of shiva called Sangamanatha in sunga which is 12 miles to the north from her village.Both the couples later came to guddapura 8 miles to the west of sunga grama helping people and donating who were needy which means \\"DAANA\\", hence her name was \\"DAANA-AMMA\\". There is a temple located in guddapura of Shri someshwaranath where danamma used to perform her usual rituals and linga puja. Knowing her importance people of certain community became her followers and trusting her. She is known to make many miracles till today showing her presence those who believe her. She is always been a helping hand to the people who are in difficulty, where there is her name there is no situation of starving or problems she's known to be the incarnation(avatar) of goddess Parvati or adishakti.she always insisted people to follow GURU-LINGA-JANGAMA,and gave lingadiksha to worship lord shiva saying \\"om namaha shivaya\\" mantra would lead us to a peaceful life and soul.Each of her miracles are described in 108 namavali by chanting those, we get power,confidence,overcome our problems from devi,adishakti. Thousands of people worship devi by visiting her temple satisfying their wishes, she has been also called as \\"Varadani Danamma\\". Later she made a journey towards rameshwara with her husband spreading the vachanas and knowledge of jagajyoti- Basavanna and built he's temple. Along with her husband She came to Kambe city, the second rajadhiraja king of Chola raja's mandalik came to know about her miracles welcomed her and took a lingadiksha from her. Then she came to Kudalsangama where basavanna was \\"lykya\\" knowing that her parents were out of this world she turned back to guddapura. One day after performing pooja with pleasure she is known to become Iykya in \\"LINGA\\" while distributing the prasad. Her body turned to an Idol,the yadavas vamshas mahadevarajas kingdom, sainatha mandalik is known to have built Danamma Devi temple. Her way of leading life was very clean and pure, same way still now the rituals and Mahapoojas are performed in a pure and clean manner. Every year we can see the fairs (jatras) during \\"chatti amavasya\\" and people are resolving all their problems doing sevas. Lot of development is being made for Maha Nirvana (jeernodhara of temple). Nirantara Dasoha is also made providing food for people coming from far off-places. God always gives His best to those who leave the choice with him....... A temple was erected after she attained Maha Nirvana, in Guddapur, Sangli District in present-day Maharashtra. Sri Danamma Devi is worshipped as a very powerful Goddess, with the power to fulfill any of her devotees' wishes and has thus been called 'Daan'-amma Devi. Sri Danamma Devi has lakhs of followers from the Jangam, Lingayat & the Vishwakarma communities from around the world who regularly visit Guddapur. Temples devoted to the Goddess can be found in Rabkavi, Haveri,hubli, Belgaum, Gokak and Vijayapura(Bijapur) in Karnataka, which attract thousands of pilgrims.

Certain special classes of manifolds also have additional algebraic structure; they may behave like groups, for instance. In that case, they are called Lie Groups. Alternatively, they may be described by polynomial equations, in which case they are called algebraic varieties, and if they additionally carry a group structure, they are called algebraic groups.  Nomenclature  The term \\"manifold\\" comes from German Mannigfaltigkeit, by Riemann. In English, \\"manifold\\" refers to spaces with a differentiable or topological structure, while \\"variety\\" refers to spaces with an algebraic structure, as in algebraic varieties. In Romance languages, manifold is translated as \\"variety\\" – such spaces with a differentiable structure are literally translated as \\"analytic varieties\\", while spaces with an algebraic structure are called \\"algebraic varieties\\". Thus for example, the French word \\"variété topologique\\" means topological manifold. In the same vein, the Japanese word \\"\\" (tayōtai) also encompasses both manifold and variety. (\\"\\" (tayō) means various.) Background Ancestral to the modern concept of a manifold were several important results of 18th and 19th century mathematics. The oldest of these was Non-Euclidean geometry, which considers spaces where Euclid's parallel postulate fails. Saccheri first studied this geometry in 1733. Lobachevsky, Bolyai, and Riemann developed the subject further 100 years later. Their research uncovered two types of spaces whose geometric structures differ from that of classical Euclidean space; these are called hyperbolic geometry and elliptic geometry. In the modern theory of manifolds, these notions correspond to manifolds with constant, negative and positive curvature, respectively. Carl Friedrich Gauss may have been the first to consider abstract spaces as mathematical objects in their own right. His theorema egregium gives a method for computing the curvature of a surface without considering the ambient space in which the surface lies. In modern terms, the theorem proved that the curvature of the surface is an intrinsic property. Manifold theory has come to focus exclusively on these intrinsic properties (or invariants), while largely ignoring the extrinsic properties of the ambient space. Another, more topological example of an intrinsic property of a manifold is the Euler characteristic. For a non-intersecting graph in the Euclidean plane, with V vertices (or corners), E edges and F faces (counting the exterior) Euler showed that V-E+F= 2. Thus 2 is called the Euler characteristic of the plane. By contrast, in 1813 Antoine-Jean Lhuilier showed that the Euler characteristic of the torus is 0, since the complete graph on seven points can be embedded into the torus. The Euler characteristic of other surfaces is a useful topological invariant, which has been extended to higher dimensions using Betti numbers. In the mid nineteenth century, the Gauss–Bonnet theorem linked the Euler characteristic to the Gaussian curvature. Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics, when considered geometrically, are naturally manifold theories. All these use the notion of several characteristic axes or dimensions (known as generalized coordinates in the latter two cases), but these dimensions do not lie along the physical dimensions of width, height, and breadth. In the early 19th century the theory of elliptic functions succeeded in giving a basis for the theory of elliptic integrals, and this left open an obvious avenue of research. The standard forms for elliptic integrals involved the square roots of cubic and quartic polynomials. When those were replaced by polynomials of higher degree, say quintics, what would happen? In the work of Niels Abel and Carl Jacobi, the answer was formulated: the resulting integral would involve functions of two complex variables, having four independent periods (i.e. period vectors). This gave the first glimpse of an abelian variety of dimension 2 (an abelian surface): what would now be called the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2. Riemann Bernhard Riemann was the first to do extensive work generalizing the idea of a surface to higher dimensions. The name manifold comes from Riemann's original German term, Mannigfaltigkeit, which William Kingdon Clifford translated as \\"manifoldness\\". In his Göttingen inaugural lecture, Riemann described the set of all possible values of a variable with certain constraints as a Mannigfaltigkeit, because the variable can have many values. He distinguishes between stetige Mannigfaltigkeit and diskrete Mannigfaltigkeit (continuous manifoldness and discontinuous manifoldness), depending on whether the value changes continuously or not. As continuous examples, Riemann refers to not only colors and the locations of objects in space, but also the possible shapes of a spatial figure. Using induction, Riemann constructs an n-fach ausgedehnte Mannigfaltigkeit (n times extended manifoldness or n-dimensional manifoldness) as a continuous stack of (n−1) dimensional manifoldnesses. Riemann's intuitive notion of a Mannigfaltigkeit evolved into what is today formalized as a manifold. Riemannian manifolds and Riemann surfaces are named after Bernhard Riemann. In 1857, Riemann introduced the concept of Riemann surfaces as part of a study of the process of analytic continuation; Riemann surfaces are now recognized as one-dimensional complex manifolds. He also furthered the study of abelian and other multi-variable complex functions. Contemporaries of Riemann Johann Benedict Listing, inventor of the word \\"topology\\", wrote an 1847 paper \\"Vorstudien zur Topologie\\" in which he defined a \\"complex\\". He first defined the Möbius strip in 1861 (rediscovered four years later by Möbius), as an example of a non- orientable surface. After Abel, Jacobi, and Riemann, some of the most important contributors to the theory of abelian functions were Weierstrass, Frobenius, Poincaré and Picard. The subject was very popular at the time, already having a large literature. By the end of the 19th century, mathematicians had begun to use geometric methods in the study of abelian functions. Poincaré Henri Poincaré's 1895 paper Analysis Situs studied three-and-higher-dimensional manifolds (which he called \\"varieties\\"), giving rigorous definitions of homology, homotopy, and Betti numbers and raised a question, today known as the Poincaré conjecture, based his new concept of the fundamental group. In 2003, Grigori Perelman proved the conjecture using Richard S. Hamilton's Ricci flow, this is after nearly a century of effort by many mathematicians. Later developments Hermann Weyl gave an intrinsic definition for differentiable manifolds in 1912. During the 1930s Hassler Whitney and others clarified the foundational aspects of the subject, and thus intuitions dating back to the latter half of the 19th century became precise, and developed through differential geometry and Lie group theory. The Whitney embedding theorem showed that manifolds intrinsically defined by charts could always be embedded in Euclidean space, as in the extrinsic definition, showing that the two concepts of manifold were equivalent. Due to this unification, it is said to be the first complete exposition of the modern concept of manifold. Eventually, in the 1920s, Lefschetz laid the basis for the study of abelian functions in terms of complex tori. He also appears to have been the first to use the name \\"abelian variety\\"; in Romance languages, \\"variety\\" was used to translate Riemann's term \\"Mannigfaltigkeit\\". It was Weil in the 1940s who gave this subject its modern foundations in the language of algebraic geometry.

He died on 19 June 1993. Life Largely self-taught, he read the classics of canonical French literature on his own initiative while working as a haberdasher in Montargis. His wife, Marguerite Kessel, encouraged him to read German literature as well. The grim and cerebral atmosphere of German Romantic literature would make itself felt in his style. In 1937, Marcel Béalu met cubist poet Max Jacob, who gave him critical encouragement and advice. In 1951, Marcel Béalu set himself up in business as a Parisian bookseller. He named his store, after a comment on his work by Jean Paulhan, Le Pont Traversé, or \\"the Crossed Bridge.\\" The store, which sold all manner of strange works in addition to the more familiar bookshop fare, moved several times, at one time into a former butcher's shop at 62 rue de Vaugirard. One of his first customers was pre-eminent French psychoanalyst, Jacques Lacan, who purchased a complete edition of Shakespeare — for which he never paid. Marcel Béalu is most consistently associated with the literature of the fantastic, and in particular with the characteristically French strain of imaginative writing. He was intrigued by the equivocal relationship of fantasy or dream to reality, the uncertainty of reality as a distinct property or mode of being, and his fiction was widely hailed for its dreamlike qualities. While his work was fantastic, it did not reflect a reductive Freudian idea of fantasy as a mere substitute for the banal. His predilection for cramped, seedy, confusing and confining spaces, and for irregularities and repetitions in time, prompted some readers to compare his work with Kafka's. In 1955, he and Rene Rougerie founded the journal Réalités secrètes, which endured until 1963. Julien Gracq, Jean Paulhan, A. Pieyre de Mandiargues, Charles Nodier, J.M.A. Paroutaud, and Jacques Sternberg were among the authors to appear in the first issue alone. Béalu did not publish a great deal of his own material in the magazine, in part because he chose to be a marginal, remote figure. And he painted, his visual work being another translation of the unreal as was his poetry and fiction. His writing was admired by Jean Paulhan and Antonin Artaud, but as yet his literary reputation has not fully developed.

John Victor Singler, \\"The Liberian government and creative fiction\\" , at Politique Africaine, originally published in Research in African Literatures 2 (4), 1980 It is based on an historic murder. Plot  This novella deals with the relationship between Gortokai, a young Liberian man, and Tene, the girl he hopes to marry. Tene has been murdered and Gortokai is jailed as a suspect. The story promises \\"to piece together all the circumstances leading to the violent storm which nearly tore off the roofs from many houses in the Dewoin country one bright Sunday morning in the year 1957.\\"Murder in the Cassava Patch (1968), Moore, Bai T., Ducor Publishing House (Monrovia), page 5 It is set in the fictional village of Bendabli, off the Monrovia-Bomi Hills road. The action ranges from Gbarpolu County in the west as far as Gbarnga and Sanniquellie in the north. Places such as Bomi Hills and Firestone are referred to. It is told as a first person narrative by Gortokai. The work uses Liberian English and Liberian customs. Moore was an indigenous Liberian who was educated at a United States university. Plot summary Gortokai is the son of a contract laborer on Fernando Po, who works in conditions akin to slavery. The man returns to Liberia to find that his contract is subject to barter, making him a virtual slave. He has to give up his son Gortokai, who is fostered by a family from Bendabli. They are Joma, an older man, and his wife Sombo Karn, with their daughters Kema and Tene. Gortokai does not know that he is not born to the family until told years later by Tene. As he gets older, Gortokai does the heavy work for the family of farming rice, making oil from palm nuts, setting traps for crayfish, and hunting meat. He also takes short-term bush-cutting contracts to earn money for the family's tobacco, salt and annual hut tax. When Gortokai comes into young manhood, he wants a wife and becomes set on Tene, who has just turned 13 and is about ten years younger than he. He sees a traditional doctor, seeking to draw Tene to him, and also asks her older sister for help. He also must negotiate a bride price. To earn the money, Gortokai takes a job at a rubber farm far away in Suehn. He sends the girls presents but hears nothing from them. He deliberately injures his foot and uses his convalescence to invite Tene to visit him. Tene and her sister arrive in Suehn, bringing Gortokai gifts of country bread and fried chicken. Gortokai's employer and his wife throw a party. They are fond of Gortokai, whom the wife calls their \\"stranger son\\" (a Liberian term referring to the informal \\"adoption\\" of a non-blood relative). The two girls drink a lot of rum. The following morning, Tene seems to both invite, and reject Gortokai's advances. Before the two girls leave, Gortokai gives Kema $23 towards the dowry of $40, plus three dollars for various ritual niceties, plus two sets of clothes for Tene's parents. Joining Suehn's palm wine circle, Gortokai hears gossip about Kema. His fellow palm wine drinkers convince him that he must buy some powerful love medicine in order to ensure that Tene stays faithful to him. Gortokai visits a country doctor. Bleng uses magic to tell Gortokai that Tene's affections are divided, and explains that the remedy will be strong love medicine. Naturally, this will cost a lot of money. Gortokai learns that his stepfather is seriously ill, and decides to return to Bendabli. It will give him a chance to get the personal items of Tene's required by the doctor. Arriving early at the village, he happens to overhear a conversation in which Tene declares her interest in \\"looking around\\", and seems to refer to adventures with other men. That night, Gortokai gets the items needed by the doctor. Bleng gives him a week to use the \\"medicine\\" and the young lover returns to Bendabli. He works on the family's hut to improve it, and also gives Tene the powder. She leaves with a lover and is revealed as pregnant. Outraged and despondent, Gortokia travels to learn more about relationships in modern Liberia. After several months, he returns to Monrovia, and learns that Tene is also in the capital, selling gari or porridge on the street. She has a young baby but has left her husband and returned to her parents' house. For the first time, Gortokai sleeps with her. They return to Bendabli to find their family house in a state of disrepair; Joma and his wife are too old to care for it. Gortokai puts things right and is promised Tene as his wife. After several months, he learns that Kema is planning to move Tene and her parents to Firestone. The old couple deny this. Kema returns from Firestone, demanding strong liquor. Gortokai overhears her conversation with Tene, and both treat him with little respect. Kema invites Tene to join her at Firestone, where the rubber workers of the plantation have money. The following morning, Gortokai cuts up a parcel of expensive clothes which he has intercepted, and scatters the pieces around town. He also asks Tene to prepare some (mashed cassava). When Tene goes to the cassava patch to prepare the domboy, she finds Gortokai waiting for her. Themes =Incest between Gortokai and Tene= The relationship suggests the taboo of incest. Gortokai claims that Tene makes the first move, suggesting she is more knowing. Gortokai appears to accept without question that his being adopted makes the relationship acceptable. He reveals that others in the village do not agree with him. Gortokai appeared to be initiated at the usual age, making him in his mid 20s when he begins to look for a wife. The couple's game of 'Mamas and Papas' takes place when Tene is a pre- pubescent girl, and Gortokai is in his early 20s. The murder takes place in 1957, when Gortokai would be in his mid-to-late 20s, and Tene would be fifteen years old. She has already had one child and a broken marriage. =Domestic slavery and hypocrisy in Liberia= Bai T. Moore discussed the novel's main theme as the issue of domestic slavery and its effects in Liberia. He presented an unsentimental view of Liberian life, showing inter-generational tension in the mid-20th century. Liberia. He expressed contradictions within and between them, especially as the traditional ways were giving way to new pressures. The son of an indentured laborer turned slave, Gortokai is accepted as a \\"son\\" by one freeborn family and as a \\"stranger son\\" by another. Jomo seems willing to accept this slave's son as a potential son-in-law, and Kema seems willing to accept him as a potential brother-in-law, provided the price is right, but Tene never fully accepts him.

It has an area of and has an average depth of . The lake lies in the valley formed by two ancient volcanoes, Mount Iriga (also known as Mount Asog) and Mount Malinao. It was created in 1641, when an earthquake caused a side of Mount Asog to collapse. The resulting landslide created a natural dam that blocked the flow of nearby streams. Another theory suggests that it was created by the eruption of Mt. Asog, which is now dormant. The lake is famous since it is one of the few bodies of water that contains the sinarapan (Mistichthys luzonensis) which is the world's smallest commercially harvested fish. Aside from the sinarapan, Lake Buhi is also home for other marine organisms such as the Irin-irin (Redigobius bikolanus), Dalag (Channa striata), Puyo (Anabas testudineus), Kotnag (Hemiramphus sp.), Burirawan (Strophidon sathete) and native catfish (Clarias sp.). Other fishes are introduced to boost the fishery industry such as the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus), common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and Bangkok hito (Clarias sp.). The forest surrounding the lake is the home of at least 25 bird species. The five endemic species are the Philippine pygmy woodpecker, Philippine hanging parrot, black-naped monarch, elegant tit and the white- eared brown dove. Other fauna found in the forest are flying lizards (Draco sp.), skinks, monitor lizards (Varanus marmoratus), civets, bats and the Philippine Cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis).Rediscovering Lake Buhi Today the lake is the main source of water supply for the National Power Corporation Hydro Electric Plant. The power plant, which was founded in 1952, generates an average of 2.8 megawatts. It is also used by the National Irrigation Administration to irrigate at least of the Riconada towns located downstream and Iriga City.Local Government Unit: Municipality of BUHI Fish kill On September 22, 2007, a fish kill in Camarines Sur's Lake Buhi threatened the livelihood of local fishermen. The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) stated that it resulted from sulfur dioxide from Iriga City, since the rains by the southwest monsoon loosened the sulfur dioxide from nearby volcanoes. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) rejected BFAR's finding. Buhi has 67,762 people and 13,238 households.

International career Shillingford made his Test debut on 10 June 2010 in the home series against South Africa and played in three matches in that series. He then toured Sri Lanka with the 2010–11 West Indies team and took five wickets in his first test match of the tour: four in the first innings triggering a Sri Lankan collapse and instigating a follow-on. However half of the third day was washed out in rain and Sri Lanka rallied after the follow-on and salvaged a draw. Bowling action On 20 November 2010 straight after his first international match, the stood umpires Asad Rauf, Richard Kettleborough and Steve Davis reported Shillingford for a suspect action. It was found that Shillingford bent his arm by 17 degrees while bowling, rendering his action illegal and on 21 December 2010 the International Cricket Council announced he had been suspended from bowling in international cricket until his action could be remodelled and reassessed. Following the news that Shillingford could not bowl in international cricket, he was dropped from the Windward Islands' squad for the 2010–11 Caribbean Twenty20. Instead he was sent to the Sagicor High Performance Centre to work on his bowling action for three-months. After testing in May 2011, it was announced that Shillingford's action was legal and he would be allowed to resume bowling in international cricket. In January 2019, Shillingford was suspended from bowling in domestic cricket matches, after his action was deemed to be illegal. International return After his bowling action was cleared, Shillingford began his return to the West Indies set up, and in September 2011 he was included in the Test squad to tour Bangladesh, though he did not play. The 2011/12 season marked Shillingford's return to the Winward Islands' squad after working on his action, and his return of 38 wickets from just five first-class matches was the equal third- highest tally in the Regional Four Day Competition. After the tournament concluded, Australia toured the West Indies and Shillingford was included in the squad for the second Test in April 2012. The match was his first Test since November 2010. Shillingford became the first Dominican to play international cricket on his home soil in a Test series in 2012 between Australia and West Indies; he took six wickets in the first innings and four in the second, making him the first West Indian spinner to take ten wickets in a test since Lance Gibbs in 1966. The West Indies embarked on a tour of England in May 2012. Shillingford was not selected in the first Test because he struggled to grip the ball in the cold weather, and partly because conditions were expected to be better suited to seam bowlers. He returned for the second Test, but managed just one wicket in the match while conceding 138 runs. In the 1st Test against New Zealand at Sabina Park in Kingston on June 11, 2014, Shillingford put on 81 runs off 56 balls for the 10th wicket with Sulieman Benn, the highest 10th wicket partnership ever at Sabina Park. Shillingford scored an unbeaten 53 off just 29 balls. His fifty came off just 25 balls, the fourth fastest Test fifty after Jacques Kallis. However, New Zealand won by 186 runs. Shillingford has the world record for top scoring for his team as a number 11 batsman in the 4th innings of a test match (53*), where his team bowled out for 216 v New Zealand. Also he was the 10th player when batting at number 11 position to top score for his team in a test innings and was only the third player to top score for his team in the 4th innings of a test match.

It is one of two large parties held in Madison, the other being the Halloween party on State Street. The party has typically featured local and out-of-state musical acts playing on house porches, balconies and backyard stages. The party has not had city sponsorship since 2012. Efforts by the university and the city to create competing events have been unsuccessful. History The Mifflin Co-op, as of 2007. Revelers and police officers at the Mifflin Street Block Party in 2007. Madison paramedics load an unconscious party-goer onto a stretcher. The Mifflin Street Block Party began in 1969 as a street protest, which involved dancing in protest against the Vietnam War. Its original date, May 3, was set to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the French student rebellion. Anti-war sentiments had accelerated in Madison since the 1967 Dow Chemical protest in which thousands of students occupied and were violently expelled from Ingraham Hall. The original event arose as part of a continuing conflict between students and police in the \\"Miffland\\" area, centered on Mifflin Street. Police refused to allow permission for the street dance and when they entered the area in response to a noise complaint, a confrontation ensued that lasted three nights and spread into the surrounding student areas. Students threw stones at the police and constructed barricades to defend themselves. The police responded with tear gas and billy clubs. At the end, 70 people were injured and more than 100 arrested, including future mayor, Paul Soglin. The event continued annually for the duration of the war, even though the traumatic effects of the nearby Sterling Hall bombing had a dampening effect on Madison anti-war efforts. In an attempt to control the event, the city created \\"Mifflin on the Mall\\" in 1979 with music and concessions on State Street Mall. By 1982, however, students had once again taken to Mifflin Street. Under sponsorship from the Mifflin Co-op, the block party was often used as a community fundraiser for various political or social causes. The co-op dropped its greater involvement in 1991 after the city requested that organizers keep alcohol within fenced-in beer gardens. By 1990, police had decided to not have any officers patrol the event and removed any official presence from the party. Despite crowds in excess of 10,000 no major problems occurred until a riot in 1996. Following this event, the city and police took more control in planning. They now effectively dictate the terms of the party, spending in excess of $80,000 on policing. On May 4, 1996, a riot broke out, when a crowd of several thousand people threw bottles at a fire truck that had come to put out a bonfire started by the crowd to combat the cold weather. Police used riot gear to retake the block. The riots resulted in thousands of dollars of damage. The 1997 event was planned very carefully, but attracted few people due to poor weather. No major riots have occurred since 1996. In 2009 the city allowed local promotional group DCNY Pro to officially sponsor the event. This would be the first time in over a decade the city had allowed a sponsor. With support from WSUM radio station they produced one live music stage at the intersection of Bassett and Mifflin street. This year attendance grew to 15,000 but arrests declined to 164. \\"Authorities credit official sponsors with the decrease in incidents. DCNY productions brought in a music stage, security staff, and food vendors.\\" The following year of 2010, DCNY Pro once again sponsored the event partnering with WSUM Radio and Maximum Ink to produce two stages, one DJ stage at Bassett and Mifflin street and another Live music stage at Bedford and Mifflin street. This year the city also granted the sponsors a small beer garden in a parking lot on the 400 block of Mifflin street. In 2011 the Cieslewicz Administration agreed to allow open alcoholic beverages in the street for individuals of legal drinking age if they have a wristband. In previous years the police had noted that their most difficult areas to control were backyards, so this change in rules is an attempt to draw people into the streets and allow greater control by police officers. Also new to the event in 2011, The Majestic Theater, a local music venue, officially sponsored and hosted the event attempting to a put greater emphasis on music. MPD officers reported the crowd size, and the number of very intoxicated people was far greater in 2011 than recent Mifflin Street Block Parties due to the change in open intoxicants rules which resulted in more underaged drinking arrests and detox conveyances by noon than were usually tallied by the end of the party.. Preliminary numbers released showed 160 people were arrested, two people were stabbed, and multiple police officers were injured during the 2011 event. Controversy surrounded the 2012 Mifflin Street Block Party which occurred on May 5, 2012. Montee Ball, a Heisman award candidate was cited for Trespassing. Patrick Kane, a star forward for the Chicago Blackhawks, reportedly choked a woman at a house party and made anti-semitic slurs at another altercation. Photos surfaced of him partying with women on Mifflin, yelling at Madison Police officers, and passed out at a local bar. The party coincided with Cinco de Mayo celebrations throughout the country. This resulted in the event drawing the condemnation of University of Wisconsin-Madison Dean of Students Lori Berquam. After months of speculation regarding the annual block party, the City of Madison released a statement officially cancelling the block party on April 12, 2013. In a release, they indicated the severe punishments that the police department will be enforcing if there are violations as well as other important information. The release also mentioned Revelry, a student-created music festival that will be held the same day as an alternative to having house parties. However, three days after the apparent cancellation of the party, the City of Madison announced that it had not in fact cancelled the annual gathering, blaming the confusion on poor wording of the previously released statement. However, to contrast years past events at the block party, in 2018 the event was reportedly calmer and more orderly. There were anywhere from 15,000 to 18,000 attendees, more than 2016 and 2017 combined. Mifflin street block party 2020 In 2020, the Mifflin Street Block Party was cancelled due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Police were seen patrolling the streets throughout the day. At one point, houses that were playing music that was audible from the street were given a police warning to turn it off, or else they would be in violation of a new city ordinance. The street was historically quiet for the day. Date change The block party occurred on the first Saturday of May every year until 2005, when University of Wisconsin–Madison students lobbied to have the date changed to the last Saturday in April to avoid conflicts with finals. Mayor Dave Cieslewicz refused the date change at first, citing the additional cost and strain it would place on the city's police force. After students vowed to throw a large celebration both weekends, the mayor agreed to move the date of the block party with a promise from student leaders that they would discourage celebrations in the first week in May. However, the mayor requested that the Associated Students of Madison pay for the additional costs of moving the date. The 2005 event was considered one of the calmest on record, with 225 arrests and 317 citations, including the arrest of the University of Wisconsin football team's running back, Booker Stanley. The block party was scheduled for Saturday, April 29 by city officials in 2006. The 2007 party marked a move back to the traditional first Saturday of May and the 2008 party was scheduled for Saturday, 3 May 2008. The 2009 block party occurred on May 2. The 2010 block party happened on May 1. The 2011 party was on April 30, and the 2012 party was on May 5. Police control Between 1998 and 2002, attendance ranged from several hundred to a couple thousand. In 2002, however, an unexpected 20,000 people showed up for the event. That same year, a riot during Madison's Halloween festivities prompted police to begin systematically clamping down on the Mifflin event. The city has consistently refused proposals by students to close the street and revive the block party under student control. A Madison police lieutenant was quoted as saying, \\"Quite frankly, we wish this event would go away.\\" Since 2002, there have been an increased number of arrests and a decrease in attendance. The majority of arrests are for alcohol-related incidents. Police have dealt with the event by heavily enforcing a number of ordinances. This has included the banning of glass containers on Mifflin, the limiting of the number of kegs that a house party can have, and the creation of a processing center for dealing with those arrested. Police are also notorious for handing out open container citations and targeting especially loud and raucous house parties. In 2004, one house received $25,000 in fines for \\"selling alcohol without a permit.\\" In 2005, police arrested 225 people and issued 317 citations. The cost to the city was $100,600 and issued $85,000 in fines, most of which was dismissed or reduced. Panoramic view of the Mifflin Street Block Party in 2009 The Madison Police Department reported 60 arrests in 2018, and most offenses were for consuming alcohol in the street, public urination, or carrying glass containers.

Manotoc Sr. is a Filipino golfer and former basketball coach. As a basketball coach of several PBA teams, Manotoc won six PBA titles, including a grand slam with the fabled Crispa Redmanizers. Manotoc served as president of the National Golf Association of the Philippines (NGAP) from 2012 to 2014. He occasionally writes as a sports columnist for the Philippine Daily Inquirer and was a TV panelist for the PBA coverage from 2000 to 2002.  Early life and family  Manotoc is the son of Ricardo Manotoc and the former Nena Arguelles La'O. Henares, Hilarion Jr. (2018-03-28) Salvation and Damnation: Make My Day 24. His father Ricardo was a realtor, while his mother belonged to the prominent La'O family. Two of his uncles - Raúl Manglapus, who had married his mother's sister Pacita La'O, and Eugenio López, Jr., who had married another sister, Conchita La'O - were prominent critics of Ferdinand Marcos. PBA career =As Head Coach= Manotoc began his coaching career in 1977 with the U/Tex Wranglers in the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA). He was the Wranglers' team manager at the time when head coach Narciso Bernardo suddenly resigned after the 1977 All-Filipino Conference. Manotoc made his coaching debut during the 1977 Open Conference and immediately brought the Wranglers to a runner-up finish against Crispa, in the franchise's first finals appearance. Manotoc gave the Wranglers two PBA Open Conference championships, in 1978 and in 1980. Manotoc joined San Miguel Beer in 1981 and led the team to one PBA championship. Manotoc joined the Crispa Redmanizers in 1983 and piloted the franchise to its second grand slam during the same season. On July 1, 1984, citing health reasons, Manotoc resigned as head coach after leading the Redmanizers to the 1984 PBA First All-Filipino Conference finals, winning over NCC, 96-94. He was to be succeeded by assistant coach Narciso Bernardo, who finished the task of capturing the title against the Gilbey's Gin Tonics. After a long hiatus from coaching, Manotoc made a brief return to the PBA — in 1992 for the Presto Ice Cream Kings — and in 1997-1998 for the Mobiline Phone Pals. =As PBA Deputy Commissioner= Manotoc briefly served as deputy commissioner of the PBA in 1985 under commissioner Mariano Yenko. =PBA Hall of Fame= Manotoc was inducted into the PBA Hall of Fame on October 2, 2011.

Early life Ellenor Frere was born on 12 March 1743/44 in Westhorpe, Suffolk to Sheppard and Susanna Frere. John Frere was her elder brother and John Hookham Frere her nephew. In 1766, she married the antiquarian John Fenn and moved with him to Hill House, Dereham, Norfolk. Although they had no biological children, they adopted and brought up an orphaned heiress, Miss Andrews.Stoker, \\"Ellenor Fenn\\". Career Fenn wrote a series of children's books for her nephews and nieces, inspired by Anna Laetitia Barbauld's Lessons for Children (1778-9), and in 1782 she wrote to the children's publisher John Marshall asking whether he would be willing to publish them. Between 1782 and 1812, he published numerous books by Fenn, often anonymously or under the pseudonyms Mrs. Teachwell or Mrs. Lovechild. Cobwebs to Catch Flies (1783), a reading primer, was perhaps her most popular book; it went through multiple editions in both Britain and America until the 1870s. Her Child's Grammar went through sixty editions by the 1860s. Fenn also created toys and games that encouraged mothers to teach their children themselves. Andrea Immel, a specialist in 18th-century childhood, writes that through her games, we can \\"recognize [Fenn] as an early advocate of child-centered teaching strategies\\"Immel, 217. The games emphasize conversation and the child's own world; they encourage the mother to answer the child's questions and to spontaneously teach when the child is interested in learning.Immel, 223. In 1795, Fenn had a falling out with her publisher, John Marshall, and moved her business to Elizabeth Newbery's firm and publishers in Norwich. Throughout her career, Fenn never received any royalties for her work, only free distribution copies of her works. Life and death in Dereham When Fenn's husband was knighted in 1787, Fenn became known as Lady Fenn. He served as High Sheriff of Norfolk from 1791–2. Upon his death on 14 February 1794, Fenn was left \\"financially secure\\" and able to devote more of her time to philanthropy. Fenn established a Sunday School in Dereham in 1785 which by 1788 had over 100 pupils. She also started a needlework school and \\"revived the trade to tow-spinning to give poor women an income.\\" Fenn died at Dereham on 1 November 1813, aged 69, and was buried at St Bartholomew's church, Finningham, Suffolk. On 29 November 2013, two hundred years after her death, Fenn was finally recognised in Dereham with the unveiling of a 'Blue Plaque' outside Hill House, her home for nearly fifty years, beside a renewed plaque for her husband. Literary analysis Many of Fenn's works were directed towards young girls and women. She wrote an entire series entitled \\"Mrs. Teachwell's Library for Young Ladies.\\" Many of these works focus on how to teach and outline Fenn's idea of proper reading materials. Fenn published several volumes of what we would now call picturebooks that employed woodcuts. Her sense of the visual layout of her books was keen and she carefully dictated to her publishers the margins and font sizes of her books.

The aircraft landed at Singapore. After their demands were not met, the hijackers threatened to begin killing hostages; before their deadline expired, commandos stormed the plane, killing the hijackers and freeing all hostages unhurt. This was the first and only hijacking involving a Singapore Airlines aircraft. Timeline The plane, an Airbus A310 with registration 9V-STP, had taken off from Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport in Subang near Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia at 21:15 SST, with 114 passengers and 11 crew on board. The plane was hijacked in mid-air while en route to Singapore Changi Airport by four Pakistanis. The hijackers were armed with explosives and knives but no firearms. It landed safely at Changi Airport at 22:15, where a group of officials from the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts, along with Singapore Airlines representatives and a negotiating team, were waiting. The hijackers, who claimed to be members of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), demanded the release of former Prime Minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari (later elected President of Pakistan), as well as other PPP members from jail. The hijackers also required the plane to be refuelled to fly to Australia. The next morning, 27 March, at 02:30, the hijackers pushed two stewards out of the aircraft, after the plane had been moved to the outer tarmac. At 06:45, the hijackers gave a last 5-minute deadline, and issued a threat to kill one passenger every ten minutes if their demands were still not met. With three minutes to go, orders were given to initiate the assault: the Singapore Armed Forces Commando Formation (SAF CDO FN) stormed the plane in a 30-second sweep, killing all four hijackers with no injuries to hostages. The hijack leader had been shot five times in the chest, but was still alive. Then he attempted to stand and ignite his explosive but a Commando shot him dead before he did so. The plane was completely secured by 06:50. Aftermath Prime Minister of Singapore Goh Chok Tong commended all those involved in handling the ordeal and rescue mission for their swiftness and efficiency. Captain Stanley Lim, the pilot of the flight, and Superintendent Foo Kia Juah, chief police negotiator, were awarded the Public Service Star for their roles. The SAF Commando Formation members were awarded the Medal for Valour, and others in the negotiating team were given Presidential Certificates of Commendation. Singapore Airlines as of 15 July 2020 continues to operate the flight number 117 between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, using an Airbus A350-900 (Flight 117 used to operate A330-300 on this route) except on Saturdays and Sundays. The aircraft The hijacked aircraft had been delivered to Singapore Airlines on 22 November 1988. The hijacked plane continued to remain in daily service with Singapore Airlines after the incident for the next 10 years, until it was transferred to Spanish airline Air Plus Comet on 11 May 2001. The plane was painted all-white and re-registered from 9V-STP to EC-HVB. On 31 May 2003, it was retired from flying and was stored in the Mojave Air and Space Port in the United States. On 25 April 2005, the untitled A310 aircraft which was registered N443RR was broken up and scrapped on site at the Mojave Air and Space Port. In 2010, the registration of the hijacked A310, 9V-STP, was then re-registered to an Airbus A330-300. In 2016, the aircraft was withdrawn from use and returned to the lessor.

The Ministry was created in 1918 as the Ministry of Labour and had several name changes before it became the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment in 1981. The Ministry is headed by the Minister of Social Affairs and Employment, currently Wouter Koolmees. Responsibilities The ministry is responsible for five fields of policy: * Employment and the labour market * Social security * Income-policy * Relations between employers and employees * Occupational safety and health Organization The ministry is currently headed by one minister and one state secretary. The ministry's main office is located in The Hague. The civil service is headed by a Secretary General and a vice-secretary general, who head a system of three directorates general: * Relations between employers and employees and international affairs * Occupational safety and Health and social insurances * Labour market policy and social welfare Furthermore, there is an inspector general responsible for the inspection employment and income, who supervises the local centres for employment and income. Mobility centres Beginning in 2006, the Ministry established a network of mobility centres whose function is to coordinate the multiple companies of any given industry to facilitate the movement of employees between companies. This is seen as an alternative to forced lay-offs. History The ministry was founded in 1933, at the height of the Great Depression. Before that the limited social policy had been the responsibility of the ministry of Economic Affairs. After the Second World War the ministry became much more important, as the Netherlands transformed into a welfare state. In 1982 the responsibility for labour market policy was transferred to the ministry from the ministry of Economic Affairs in order to enlarge the portfolio of Deputy Prime Minister Joop den Uyl. Emancipation also became a responsibility of the ministry.

He served with irregular forces in several parts of the world in the 1920s and 1930s, most notably in the Spanish Civil War, and was a significant figure at the Osterley Park training school for the British Home Guard during World War II. republished at The University Libraries, University of Iowa Similar combat training was provided to forces in the United States and Canada, and he was an itinerant lecturer and provocateur on the subject.  Background  Levy was born in Hamilton, Canada to a Jewish family. His family moved to Buffalo, New York, US when he was three months old, and then to Cleveland, Ohio when he was seven years old. His parents were Samuel Levy, a tailor and \\"horse doctor\\", and Sarah Pollock. Bert Levy had nine siblings. To counter a frail constitution, Levy became a Boy Scout and a boxer. He grew up on the streets and stated that his \\"real education was in the school of hard knocks\\". At age 16, he quit school after his father was seriously injured by a trolley. He took employment with the Kaber Printing Company in Cleveland for four years to help support his younger siblings. In 1916, he joined the British Merchant Navy working as a stoker. In the spring of 1918, Levy enlisted in the 39th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (part of the Jewish Legion). Levy continued boxing through World War I and was the regimental bantamweight champion. After returning to Cleveland from the war, he briefly turned professional. He fought in 23 matches before retiring \\"in order to maintain family harmony\\". He married Mary Prezenter, who was a clerk. They had one daughter. He was a pipe smoker, and played the mandolin. In 1927 he was arrested along with four other men and a woman for a series of robberies. During the search, police discovered a cache of guns. Levy was convicted and sentenced to 2550 years. He was convicted of the January 1927 armed robbery of a Philadelphia A&P; food market. Even for his only criminal conviction, Judge Harry McDevitt imposed a severe sentence in the penitentiary. After serving six years, in 1933 he was released and deported to Canada (he was presumed to be a Canadian citizen at the time).  Military career  = Field service = He served in five wars many of the wars and insurrections between 1911 and 1945. Trying to find the truth of Levy's exploits is problematic, as Levy tended to embellish his biography. From 1918 to 1919 Levy served with the 39th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (part of the Jewish Legion) in Palestine and Transjordan. That tour ended when he was gassed and contracted malaria. He trained in Nova Scotia, England, and Egypt, and was dispatched as a machine gunner. In September 1918 his unit moved through the Egyptian desert. The unit entered the Jordan River valley, taking control of Es-Salt in a campaign against the Turks. With two other members of the 39th Battalion, he encountered scouts of Colonel T. E. Lawrence. The scouts invited them to tea, and told them stories of amazing feats, and \\"Levy decided on a lifelong career in guerrilla warfare.\\" In 1920–21, he was, in his own (attributed) words \\"mixed up in Mexico\\" towards the end of the revolution there. Subsequently, he was involved in gun-running in Nicaragua, where he served under General Sandino. In Nicaragua, he outfitted a ship with sandbagged Lewis gun \\"emplacements in case of a surprise en route by U.S. patrol vessels.\\" His service with the Sandinistas was cut short when the United States and U.S. Marines appeared, as \\"he had no desire to fight his fellow countrymen.\\" Another scenario is that the Sandinistas deemed the continued reliability of Americans to be dubious as a force opposing the Marines, and they were involuntarily retired. In 1921 Levy was employed to train Mexicans in the use of the Lewis gun. He left after 6 months when some trainees used their guns on prisoners. Levy also claimed to have participated in \\"troubles\\" in countries to the south of Mexico, and to have been sentenced to thirty years imprisonment for gun running. The Levys were now broke, and living in marital discord. During the Spanish Civil War Levy served with the International Brigade as an officer in the British Battalion, under Tom Wintringham, from 1937. The brigade fought against the rightist Falangists. He was captured at the Battle of Jarama where he had manned a heavy machine gun. He was captured on the second day and there is a photo of him and other British machine gunners in the custody of the Guardia Civil.Cullen, Stephen. \\"Home Guard Socialism: A Vision of a People's Army.\\" University of Warwick, 2006. 46. Retrieved 23 August 2014. He spent six months in a Francoist gaol. A protest from the Canadian government led to Levy's release in a prisoner exchange for two Italian officers something he characterized as \\"a fair deal.\\" Even after all that, he still had to be prevented by friends from re-enlisting and returning to the fray. Upon his release, he went back to Canada and personally recruited 1,200 volunteers for the Republican cause. In 1940, with the outbreak of World War II he tried to enlist with the Canadian Army, but was refused on medical grounds. \\"He volunteered to join the Canadian Army as soon as this war broke out, and was turned down for flat feet or hammer toes or perhaps, more seriously, for his reputation as one of the most obstreperous leaders of Canada's unemployed.\\"  Training officer and consultant  = United Kingdom = Following this refusal, Levy worked his passage to Britain as a stoker on a steamer. After arriving in the United Kingdom, he rejoined Wintringham and other International Brigade veterans. Levy worked alongside these other veterans on Home Guard training, and was involved in the establishment of an unofficial training school for the Home Guard at Osterley Park. The school was funded in part by Wendell Endicott (shoe magnate of Endicott-Johnson Shoes), a Home Guard and Levy's lectures were well received. Nazi propagandist Lord Haw-Haw dubbed the Osterley trainees to be \\"Osterley cut throats\\" because of their hardened approach to guerrilla warfare. This was \\"Home Guard School #1.\\" Although the school became famous through its appearance in newsreels and newspaper articles around the world (particularly in the US), the socialism espoused by the school's instructors met with disapproval by the War Office (WO) and Winston Churchill, and it was taken over by the WO in September 1940. Closed in 1941, its staff and courses were reallocated to other newly opened WO-approved Home Guard schools. While lecturing there Wintringham helped Levy write his book described by some as a \\"war pamphlet\\" Guerrilla Warfare as a practical manual. It originated in the lectures given at Osterley Park, and had much to say about close quarters combat. This was published in mass market paperback in Britain and the U.S. and ran to several editions. Levy advocated guerrilla warfare as a democratic means of combating fascism, frequently attacking the military establishment who overlooked the lessons born of such commanders as T. E. Lawrence and their experience in irregular war. He also recounts some of his adventures as a guerrilla, such as the time he and his companions trapped cats' tails in mouse traps as a means of distracting sentries. Wintringham said that Levy was the most effective communicator in Great Britain on the tactics of commando and guerrilla warfare. His primary lecture subject was knife fighting and hand-to- hand combat. \\"Yank\\" Levy was not just a soldier and an efficient killer, but was a committed Socialist with a socialist's set of values and approach, which influenced his analysis and his goals and presentations. It wasn't just all technical stuff, but was an attempt to incite the local populace to provide for the common defense. Thus, there was an attempt to harness \\"the enduring patriotism of the population.\\" Metaphors were made of Home Guard guerrilla defence against Adolf Hitler to historical antecedents, such as Hereward the Wake resistance to the 'heavily armoured forces' of William the Conqueror. Levy admitted that Hereward was not triumphant. Seeking to mobilize popular sentiment, he urged readers to look at the Arab Revolt and Orde Wingate's part in organising 'Jewish irregulars in Palestine'. He counseled that reading fictional accounts of guerrilla warfare would provide guidance, including those describing campaigns in Ireland, Spain and China, such as: Ernie O'Malley's On Another Man's Wound; Ernest Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls; and Edgar Snow's Scorched Earth, respectively. The book had significant impact and it received favorable press. Time magazine wrote: > Anyone who thinks his country will be invaded which includes anyone now > alive would do well to read \\"Yank\\" Levi's Guerrilla Warfare for instruction > on to harass invaders.

That the handbook was available for 1725¢ per copy was a factor in its being widely circulated. Over a half million copies were printed. = United States = Despite having been deported from the United States in 1933, his proficiency caused the United States to take him back so he could train soldiers at the request of Secretary of State Cordell Hull. Under the direction of General Sherman Miles, who was commanding the First Corps, Levy taught 30 Regular Army and 76 National Guard soldiers, training them to act as partisans in Concord, Massachusetts. The location, \\"by the rude bridge that arched the flood\\", was not accidental but was intended to be a call to arms and to invoke the mystique of the Minutemen. He was the first instructor at the school. The mantra was that an indigenous civilian population could rise up and skillfully harass, destroy, debilitate, resist and kill an occupying enemy this was counter to the conventional wisdom, as guerrilla warfare was deemed unclean and harsh at the time. There would be no adherence to the Marquess of Queensberry Rules. He was trying to impart the methods he taught to the Home Guard, while preaching the scorched earth policies that had been ordered by Josef Stalin to thwart the Nazis who were invading the Soviet Union. Homeland defense was to be an opportunistic counterpunch. The Soviets had demonstrated that partisans could attack enemy logistics and lines of communication, thereby disrupting the onslaught of mechanized warfare. As he later told spectators at Harvard University: > \\"Invisibility is better than protection and intimate knowledge of terrain is > most important. Utilizing this knowledge of the countryside and employing > guerilla tactics, units of the Home Guard have defeated troops of the > Regular Army in war games in Britain. With such units in every town and > hamlet, the English people form a widespread web to trap an invader from any > direction.\\" = Canada = Throughout World War II, he continued to proselytize the need for a home guard in America, Canada and Great Britain, and to teach that guerrilla warfare was a key ingredient of an effective defense. He taught the Pacific Coast Militia Rangers in Canada, as it was felt that they needed more than home grown expertise. He was a trainer of forces at Nanaimo, Vancouver Island that were going to invade the Aleutian Islands in Operation Cottage. = World War II: later years = In 1943 Levy designed a combat knife, which he unsuccessfully tried to patent and market through the cutlers W. R. Case & Sons. Subsequently, he returned to lecture in America as an advance party when Wintringham was invited to start an Osterley style school in San Bernardino. The school was abandoned when the two local Home Guard commanders shot each other during an argument. Levy gave a successful US lecture tour and had his face pictured on the cover of Life Magazine proclaiming him to be an: Ace Guerrilla, and having a multipage story titled How to be a Guerrilla. Later, he returned to the UK to form part of Wintringham's occasional 'flying squads' mobile training units which toured provincial Home Guard units in temporary, often unofficial, training camps. After appearing at Harvard University, where he was billed as an \\"Instructor in \\"cad warfare\\" for the British Commandos, Bert \\"Yank\\" Levy, veteran of every war or revolution since 1911, spoke on his work to a mixed gathering of the Naval Supply Corps, Harvard ROTC, and students on Monday in the Stadium.\\" He particularly emphasized the need for individual civilian warfare. He lectured on the Home Guard and the tactics of insurgency. The Harvard Crimson noted: \\"\\"Yank\\" expects to leave this country within a few days to return to Britain, where Goebbels has promised that he will be among the first to be shot when the Germans capture England.\\" The United States Infantry Journal called him the greatest instructor on defensive fighting. His life story was illustrated in a comic book entitled Jewish War Heroes, published by the Canadian Jewish Congress in January 1944. His approach to asymmetrical warfare was seen by some as an unfortunate portent of post-World War II conflicts.  Postwar career and legacy  In 1946, he sought to go to Palestine, and filed a passport request with the U.S. federal government. His request was denied ostensibly because of potential diplomatic problems associated with his championing guerrilla warfare and \\"dirty tricks\\" that he taught to the Home Guard. On April 15, 1954, he was pardoned by Pennsylvania Governor John S. Fine for the 1927 conviction for armed robbery. He had served six years of a 2550 year sentence, before being deported to Canada. He thereafter learned that he was by birth an American citizen, and that the deportation was illegal. His lawyer invoked Levy's chronic arthritis and penury, his law-abiding conduct with his wife and daughter in Los Angeles, and his list of good works in helping the war effort. The petition for executive clemency was approved by the state parole board, and then the governor. He was represented by Hanley Rubensohn, a Philadelphia attorney, who said that Levy only wanted to wipe out the one blot on his record, so that he could live in peace. At the time of his pardon, Levy was in hospital. Medical expenses had dissipated his earnings from lectures and book sales. His attorney for the pardon proceeding concluded that he had paid his debt to society. Levy suffered a heart attack in 1965 that led to his death and the derailment of a planned biography, based on his memorabilia and correspondence, with writer Don Dwiggins; as of 2014, this source material survived in Los Angeles. In 2006 it was announced that an American writer, Todd Winer, was conducting research for a biography \\"which promises to be fascinating reading, with Levy as a latter day Stephen Crane or Jack London.\\" Levy's reputation continues to depend on his World War II textbook. It was reissued in 2009 as: Guerrilla Warfare: An Infantry Journal. Levy was also covered in Liberty Magazine, November 21, 1942; American Rifleman, May 1942; Coronet, October 1942; and The Christian Science Monitor, June 17, 1942. The New York Times also carried an obituary on September 5, 1965. In 1965, researcher and author Robert Emmett Johnson corresponded with Levy about the latter's involvement in Nicaragua.

Historically speaking, bilateral relations between the United States and the various countries of Latin America have been multifaceted and complex, at times defined by strong regional cooperation and at others filled with economic and political tension and rivalry. Although relations between the U.S. government and most of Latin America were limited prior to the late 1800s, for most of the past century, the United States has unofficially regarded parts of Latin America as within its sphere of influence, and for much of the Cold War (1947–1991), actively vied with the Soviet Union for influence in the Western Hemisphere. Today, the ties between the United States and most of Latin America (with the exception of certain countries such as Cuba and Venezuela) are generally cordial, but there remain areas of tension between the two sides. Latin America is the largest foreign supplier of oil to the United States and its fastest-growing trading partner, as well as the largest source of drugs and U.S. immigrants, both documented and otherwise, all of which underline the continually evolving relationship between the country and region.US-Latin America Relations Overview Until the end of the 19th century, the US had a special relationship primarily with nearby Mexico and Cuba. (apart from Mexico and the Spanish colony of Cuba) was largely tied to Britain. The United States had no involvement in the process by which Spanish colonies broke away and became independent around 1820. In cooperation with, and help from Britain, the United States issued the Monroe Doctrine in 1823, warning against the establishment of any additional European colonies in Latin America. Texas, which had been settled by colonies of Americans, fought a successful war for independence from Mexico in 1836. Mexico refused to recognize the independence and warned that annexation to the United States meant war. Annexation came in 1845 and the Mexican–American War began in 1846. The American military was easily triumphant. The result was the Mexican Cession of Santa Fe de Nuevo México and Alta California. About 60,000 Mexicans remained in the territories and became US citizens. France took advantage of the American Civil War (1861–65), using its army to take over Mexico. Due to defeats in Europe, France pulled out troops, leaving the Imperialists and Maximilian I of Mexico to face defeat from the Benito Juarez-led Republicans (backed by the US). The Anglo-Venezuelan boundary dispute of Guayana Esequiba in 1895 asserted for the first time a more outward-looking American foreign policy, particularly in the Americas, marking the United States as a world power. This was the earliest example of modern interventionism under the Monroe Doctrine, in which the U.S. exercised its claimed prerogatives in the Americas. By the late nineteenth century the rapid economic growth of the United States increasingly troubled Latin America. A Pan-American Union was created under American aegis, but it had little impact as did its successor the Organization of American States. Maine! And Don't Forget the Starving Cubans!\\" As unrest in Cuba escalated in the 1890s, the United States demanded reforms that Spain was unable to accomplish. The result was the short Spanish–American War of 1898, in which United States acquired Puerto Rico and set up a protectorate over Cuba under the Platt Amendment rule passed as part of the 1901 Army Appropriations Bill. The building of the Panama Canal absorbed American attention from 1903. The US facilitated a revolt that made Panama independent from Colombia and set up the Panama Canal Zone as an American owned and operated district that was finally returned to Panama in 1979. The Canal opened in 1914 and proved a major factor in world trade. The United States paid special attention to protection of the military approaches to the Panama Canal, including threats by Germany. Repeatedly it seized temporary control of the finances of several countries, especially Haiti and Nicaragua. The Mexican Revolution started in 1911; it alarmed American business interests that had invested in Mexican mines and railways. The United States involvement in the Mexican Revolution, include, among other violations of sovereignty, the ambassadorial backing of a coup and assassination of President Francisco I. Madero and the military occupation of Veracruz. Large numbers of Mexicans fled the war-torn revolution into the southwestern United States. Meanwhile, the United States increasingly replaced Britain as the major trade partner and financier throughout Latin America. The US adopted a \\"Good Neighbor Policy\\" in the 1930s, which meant friendly trade relations would continue regardless of political conditions or dictatorships. This policy responded to longstanding Latin American diplomatic pressure for a regional declaration of nonintervention, as well as the increasing resistance and cost of US occupations in Central America and the Caribbean. One effect of the two world wars was a reduction in European presence in Latin America and an increasing solidification of the US position. \\"The proclamation of the Monroe Doctrine that the hemisphere was closed to European powers, which was presumptuous in 1823, had become effective by the eve of the World War I, at least in terms of military alliances,\\" Friedman and Long note. United States signed up the major countries as allies against Germany and Japan in World War II. However, some countries like Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela only declared war on Axis powers in 1945 (though most had broken relations previously). The era of the Good Neighbor Policy ended with the ramp-up of the Cold War in 1945, as the United States felt there was a greater need to protect the western hemisphere from Soviet Union influence and a potential rise of communism. These changes conflicted with the Good Neighbor Policy's fundamental principle of non-intervention and led to a new wave of US involvement in Latin American affairs. \\"In the 1950s, the United States shifted from an earlier tradition of direct military intervention to covert and proxy interventions in the cases of Guatemala (1954), Cuba (1961), Guyana (1961–64), Chile (1970–73), and Nicaragua (1981–90), as well as outright military invasions of the Dominican Republic (1965), Grenada (1983), and Panama (1989).\\" The first decade of the Cold War saw relative high degrees of consensus between US and Latin American elites, centered on anti-communism, though with divergences over the direction of economic policy. Later decades of the Cold War saw higher levels of violence in conflicts with overlapping local, US-Latin American, and global Cold War dimensions, referred to by historian Tanya Harmer as the \\"inter-American Cold War.\\" The turn of Castro's revolution in Cuba after 1959 toward Soviet communism alienated Cuba from the United States, though reactions to the revolution varied considerably across Latin America. An attempted invasion failed and at the peak of the Cold War in 1962, the Cuban Missile Crisis threatened major war as the Soviet Union installed nuclear weapons in Cuba to defend it from an American invasion. The crisis also shook the domestic politics of Latin American countries, where governments initially exhibited little sympathy for Cuba. There was no invasion, but the United States imposed an economic boycott on Cuba that remains in effect, as well as a broke off diplomatic relations, that lasted until 2015. The US also saw the rise of left-wing governments in central America as a threat and, in some cases, overthrew democratically elected governments perceived at the time as becoming left-wing or unfriendly to U.S. interests. Examples include the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état, the 1964 Brazilian coup d'état, the 1973 Chilean coup d'état and the support of the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. After 1960, Latin America increasingly supplied illegal drugs, especially marijuana and cocaine to the rich American market. One consequence was the growth of extremely violent drug gangs in Mexico and other parts of Central America attempting to control the drug supply. In the 1970s and 1980s, the United States gave strong support to violent anti- Communist forces in Latin America. The fall of Soviet communism in 1989–92 largely ended the communist threat. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) took effect in 1994 and dramatically increased the volume of trade among Mexico, the United States and Canada. In the post-Cold War period, Pastor and Long noted, \\"democracy and free trade seemed to have consolidated, and it looked as though the United States had found an exit from the whirlpool. But as the first decade of this century concludes, that prediction seems premature. Democracy is again endangered, free trade has stalled and threatens to go into reverse, and the exit from the whirlpool is not as clearly marked.\\" Street art in Venezuela, depicting Uncle Sam and accusing the U.S. government of imperialism As of late, several left-wing parties have gained power through elections, and Venezuela under the late Hugo Chávez and his successor Nicolás Maduro has been particularly critical of U.S. foreign policy; Nicaragua, Bolivia, and Ecuador currently have governments sometimes seen as aligned with Venezuela, while Cuba and the U.S. continue to have non- existent relations. Left-wing governments in nations such as Brazil, Peru, Paraguay, Argentina, and Uruguay during this period were considerably more centrist and neutral. The centre-right governments in Argentina, Mexico, Panama, Chile, and Colombia have closer relations with the U.S., with Mexico being the U.S.'s largest economic partner in Latin America and its third largest overall trade partner after Canada and China. Thanks to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) signed with Canada and Mexico in 1994, the United States enjoys virtual duty-free trade with Mexico. Since 1994, the United States has signed other notable free-trade agreements with Chile in 2004, Peru in 2007, and most recently Colombia and Panama in 2011. By 2015, relations were tense between United States and Venezuela. Large-scale immigration from Latin America to the United States grew since the late 20th century. Today approximately 18% of the U.S. population is Hispanic and Latino Americans, totaling more than 50 million people, mostly of Mexican and Central American background. Furthermore, over 10 million illegal immigrants live in the United States, most of them with Hispanic origins. Many send money back home to family members and contribute considerably to the domestic economies of their countries of origin. Large-scale immigration to the United States came primarily from Mexico and Cuba. Smaller, though still significant, immigrant populations from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala and Colombia exist in the United States. Most of Latin America is still part of the Organization of American States, and remains bound by the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance also known as the Rio Pact, which provides for hemispheric defense, with the exceptions of Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Mexico and Venezuela, all of which withdrew from the Treaty during the past decade. In addition, Argentina is a major non-NATO ally of the United States, the result of a policy of reapproachment and market liberalization led by President Carlos Menem during the 1990s which saw the country send troops as part of the coalition in the Gulf War and become one of the world's largest contributors to UN peacekeeping operations. After a period of worsening relations during the late 2000s administration of Cristina Kirchner, the election of centre-right President Mauricio Macri has resulted in renewed interest in both countries to continue improving trade and bilateral relations.  19th century to World War I  =Venezuelan independence= Following the events of the Revolution of April 19, 1810, the Captain General Vicente Emparan, designated by Joseph Bonaparte to govern the Captaincy General of Venezuela, were deposed by an expanded municipal government in Caracas that called itself the Supreme Junta to Preserve the Rights of Ferdinand VII (La Suprema Junta Conservadora de los Derechos de Fernando VII). One of the first acts of the Junta was to send a diplomatic mission to the United States to seek the recognition of the Supreme Junta of Caracas as the legitimate government of Venezuela in the absence of the King. Juan Vicente Bolívar Palacios, Jose Rafael Revenga and Telesforo Orea managed to attract the interest of the government of President James Madison to support the Supreme Junta. =Chilean independence= In 1811, the arrival of Joel Roberts Poinsett in Santiago de Chile marked the beginning of U.S. involvement in Chilean politics. He had been sent by President James Madison in 1809 as a special agent to the South American Spanish colonies to investigate the prospects of the revolutionaries in their struggle for independence from Spain. =Monroe Doctrine= The 1823 Monroe Doctrine, which began the United States' policy of isolationism, deemed it necessary for the United States to refrain from entering into European affairs but protect nations in the Western hemisphere from foreign military intervention, and warned against the establishment of any additional European colonies in Latin America. Despite this, European interventions continued to occur in American countries with the tacit or explicit support of the United States. These interventions include the occupation of the Falkland Islands by Britain in 1833, the French naval blockade of Argentine ports between 1839 and 1840, the Anglo-French blockade of the River Plate from 1845 to 1850, the Spanish invasion of the Dominican Republic between 1861 and 1865, the French intervention in Mexico between 1862 and 1865, the British occupation of the Mosquito coast in Nicaragua and the occupation of the Guayana Essequiba in Venezuela by Great Britain in 1855. =Anderson–Gual Treaty= The Anderson–Gual Treaty (formally, the General Convention of Peace, Amity, Navigation, and Commerce) was an 1824 treaty between the United States and Gran Colombia (now the modern day countries of Venezuela, Colombia, Panama and Ecuador). It was the first bilateral treaty concluded by the United States with another American country. The treaty was signed in Santafe de Bogotá on October 3, 1824, by U.S. diplomat, Richard Clough Anderson Jr., and by Venezuelan minister, Pedro Gual Escandón. It was ratified by both countries and began enforcement in May 1825. The commercial provisions of the treaty granted reciprocal most-favored-nation status and were maintained despite the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830. The treaty contained a clause that stated it would be in force for 12 years after ratification by both parties; the treaty therefore expired in 1837. =Anfictionic Congress of Panama= The notion of an international union in the New World was first put forward by the Venezuelan Liberator Simón Bolívar who, at the 1826 Congress of Panama (still being part of Gran Colombia), proposed a league of all American republics with a common military, a mutual defense pact and a supranational parliamentary assembly. Bolívar's dream of Latin American unity was meant to unify Hispanic American nations against external powers, including the United States. The meeting was attended by representatives of Gran Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, the United Provinces of Central America, and Mexico but the grandly titled \\"Treaty of Union, League, and Perpetual Confederation\\" was ultimately ratified only by Gran Colombia. The United States' delegates to the Congress were delayed by internal politics in the United States. Though delegates were eventually dispatched by President John Quincy Adams, one (Richard Clough Anderson Jr.) died en route to Panama, and the other (John Sergeant) arrived after the Congress had concluded. Thus Great Britain, which attended with only observer status, managed to negotiate many trade deals with Latin American countries. Bolívar's dream soon foundered, with civil war in Gran Colombia, the disintegration of Central America and the emergence of national, rather than New World, outlooks in the newly independent American republics. =Mexican–American War (April 1846 – February 1848)= Overview map of the Mexican–American War Texas, settled primarily by Anglo-Americans, fought a successful war of independence against Mexico in 1836. Mexico refused to recognize the independence and warned that annexation to the United States meant war. US Annexation of Texas occurred in 1845; predictably, war followed annexation in 1846. The American military was triumphant. The result was the American purchase of New Mexico, Arizona, California and adjacent areas. About 60,000 Mexicans remained in the new territories and became US citizens. In 1862, French forces under Napoleon III invaded and conquered Mexico, giving control to the puppet monarch Emperor Maximilian I. Washington denounced this as a violation of the Monroe Doctrine, but was unable to intervene because of the American Civil War. In 1865, the United States stationed a large combat army on the border to emphasize its demand that France leave. France did pull out and Mexican nationalists executed Maximilian.M. M. McAllen, Maximilian and Carlota: Europe's Last Empire in Mexico (2014) =Ostend Manifesto= The Ostend Manifesto of 1854 was a proposal circulated by American diplomats that proposed the United States offer to purchase Cuba from Spain, while implying that the U.S. should declare war if Spain refused. Nothing came of it. Diplomatically, the US was content to see the island remain in Spanish hands so long as it did not pass to a stronger power such as Britain or France. =War of the Pacific (1879–1883)= The United States tried to bring an early end to the War of the Pacific in 1879, mainly because of US business interests in Peru, but also because its leaders worried that the United Kingdom would take economic control of the region through Chile. Peace negotiations failed when a stipulation required Chile to return the conquered lands. Chileans suspected the new US initiative was tainted with a pro-Peruvian bias. As a result, relations between Chile and the United States took a turn for the worse. page 70 Chile instead asked that the United States remain neutral and the United States, unable to match Chilean naval power, backed down. =Big Brother policy= US Secretary of State, James G. Blaine, created the Big Brother policy in the 1880s, aiming to rally Latin American nations behind US leadership and to open Latin American markets to U.S. traders. Blaine served as United States Secretary of State in 1881 in the cabinet of President James Garfield and again from 1889 to 1892 in the cabinet of President Benjamin Harrison. As part of the policy, Blaine arranged for and lead as the first president the First International Conference of American States in 1889. Blaine went on to live for a few years in Mexico following his success in their relations. =Venezuelan crisis of 1895= President Cleveland twists the tail of the British Lion, cartoon in Puck by J.S. Pughe, 1895 Map showing: * The extreme border claimed by Britain * The current boundary (roughly) and * The extreme border claimed by Venezuela The Venezuelan crisis of 1895 occurred over Venezuela's longstanding dispute with the United Kingdom about the territory of Essequibo and Guayana Esequiba, which Britain claimed as part of British Guiana and Venezuela saw as Venezuelan territory. As the dispute became a crisis, the key issue became Britain's refusal to include the territory east of the \\"Schomburgk Line\\", in the proposed international arbitration, which a surveyor had drawn half a century earlier as a boundary between Venezuela and the former Dutch territory of British Guiana.King (2007:249) By December 17, 1895, President Grover Cleveland delivered an address to the United States Congress reaffirming the Monroe Doctrine and its relevance to the dispute. The crisis ultimately saw the Britain Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, accept the United States' intervention to force arbitration of the entire disputed territory and tacitly accept the United States' right to intervene under the Monroe Doctrine. A tribunal convened in Paris in 1898 to decide the matter, and in 1899, awarded the bulk of the disputed territory to British Guiana.Graff, Henry F., Grover Cleveland (2002). . pp123-25 For the first time, the Anglo-Venezuelan boundary dispute asserted a more outward-looking American foreign policy, particularly in the Americas, marking the United States as a world power. This was the earliest example of modern interventionism under the Monroe Doctrine, in which the U.S. exercised its claimed prerogatives in the Americas. =Spanish–American War (1898)= The Spanish–American War was a conflict fought between Spain and the United States in 1898. Hostilities began in the aftermath of sinking of the USS Maine in Havana harbor, leading to American intervention in the Cuban War of Independence. The sinking of the USS Maine occurred on February 15, resulting in the deaths of 266 people and causing the United States to blame Spain, since the ship had been sent to Havana in order to protect a community of U.S. citizens there. American acquisition of Spain's Pacific possessions led to its involvement in the Philippine Revolution and ultimately in the Philippine–American War. Revolts against Spanish rule had been occurring for some years in Cuba as is demonstrated by the Virginius Affair in 1873. In the late 1890s, journalists Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst which used yellow journalism, anti-Spanish propaganda, to agitate U.S. public opinion and encourage war. However, the Hearst and Pulitzer papers circulated among the working class in New York City and did not reach a national audience.W. Joseph Campbell, Yellow journalism: Puncturing the myths, defining the legacies (2001). After the mysterious sinking of the US Navy battleship in Havana harbor, political pressures from the Democratic Party pushed the administration of Republican President William McKinley into a war he had wished to avoid.. Spain promised time and again that it would reform, but never delivered. The United States sent an ultimatum to Spain demanding it surrender control of Cuba. First Madrid, then Washington, formally declared war.. Although the main issue was Cuban independence, the ten-week war was fought in both the Caribbean and the Pacific. US naval power proved decisive, allowing expeditionary forces to disembark in Cuba against a Spanish garrison already facing nationwide Cuban insurgent attacks and further wasted by yellow fever. states: \\"In the larger view, the Cuban insurrection had already brought the Spanish army to the brink of defeat. During three years of relentless war, the Cubans had destroyed railroad lines, bridges, and roads and paralyzed telegraph communications, making it all but impossible for the Spanish army to move across the island and between provinces. [The] Cubans had, moreover, inflicted countless thousands of casualties on Spanish soldiers and effectively driven Spanish units into beleaguered defensive concentrations in the cities, there to suffer the further debilitating effects of illness and hunger.\\" Numerically superior Cuban, Philippine and US forces obtained the surrender of Santiago de Cuba and Manila despite the good performance of some Spanish infantry units and fierce fighting for positions such as San Juan Hill. With two obsolete Spanish squadrons sunk in Santiago de Cuba and Manila Bay and a third, more modern fleet recalled home to protect the Spanish coasts, Madrid sued for peace.. The result was the 1898 Treaty of Paris, negotiated on terms favorable to the U.S., which allowed temporary U.S. control of Cuba and ceded ownership of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippine islands. The cession of the Philippines involved payment of $20 million ($ today) to Spain by the US to cover infrastructure owned by Spain. The war began exactly fifty-two years after the beginning of the Mexican–American War. It was one of only five out of twelve US wars (against a total of eleven sovereign states) to have been formally declared by Congress. =Venezuelan crisis of 1902–1903= Middle America, showing the places affected by U.S. interventions The Venezuelan crisis of 1902–03 was a naval blockade imposed against Venezuela by Britain, Germany and Italy and lasted from December 1902 to February 1903. The blockade was a result of President Cipriano Castro's refusal to pay foreign debts and damages suffered by European citizens in the recent Venezuelan Federal War. Castro assumed that the United States' Monroe Doctrine would see the US prevent European military intervention, but at the time, President Roosevelt interpreted the Doctrine to concern European seizure of territory, rather than intervention per se. With prior promises that no such seizure would occur, the US allowed the action to go ahead without objection. The blockade quickly disabled Venezuela's small navy, but Castro refused to give in. Instead, he agreed in principle to submit some of the claims to international arbitration, which he had previously rejected. Germany initially objected to this, particularly because it felt some claims should be accepted by Venezuela without arbitration. U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt forced the blockading nations to back down by sending his own larger fleet under Admiral George Dewey and threatening war if the Germans landed.Edmund Morris, \\"'A Matter Of Extreme Urgency' Theodore Roosevelt, Wilhelm II, and the Venezuela Crisis of 1902,\\" Naval War College Review (2002) 55#2 pp 73–85 With Castro failing to back down, increased U.S. and British pressure, and American press reaction to the affair, the blockading nations agreed to a compromise. However, the blockade remained during negotiations over the details of the compromise. The Washington Protocols agreement was signed on February 13, 1903. The agreement lifted the blockade and obligated Venezuela commit 30% of its customs duties to settling claims. When the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague subsequently awarded preferential treatment to the blockading powers against the claims of other nations, the U.S. feared this would encourage future European intervention. This incident was a major driver of the Roosevelt Corollary and the subsequent U.S. Big Stick policy and Dollar Diplomacy in Latin America. =Platt Amendment= On March 2, 1901, the Platt Amendment was passed as part of the 1901 Army Appropriations Bill.1901 Platt Amendment commentary at the US Archives online It stipulated seven conditions for the withdrawal of United States troops remaining in Cuba at the end of the Spanish–American War and an eighth condition that Cuba sign a treaty accepting these seven conditions. The amendment defined the terms of Cuban and U.S. relations to essentially be an unequal, with U.S. dominance over Cuba. On December 25, 1901, Cuba amended its constitution to contain the text of the Platt Amendment.US archives online , Date of ratification by Cuba On May 22, 1903, Cuba entered into a treaty with the United States to allow the United States to intervene unilaterally in Cuban affairs and a pledge to lease land to the United States for naval bases on the island as Guantanamo. = Panama Canal = Roosevelt intimidating Colombia to acquire the Canal Zone Theodore Roosevelt, who became President of the United States in 1901, believed that a U.S.-controlled canal across Central America was a vital strategic interest to the United States. This idea gained wide impetus following the destruction of the battleship in Cuba on February 15, 1898. The , a battleship stationed in San Francisco, was dispatched to take her place, but the voyage—around Cape Horn—took 67 days. Although she was in time to join in the Battle of Santiago Bay, the voyage would have taken just three weeks via Panama. A voyage through a canal in Panama or Nicaragua would have reduced travel time by 60–65% and shortened the travel to 20–25 days. The Panama Canal Zone, which was established on shaky legal grounds,Shoultz, Lars. Beneath the United States pg. 166–169. The U.S. violated Colombian sovereignty in that they supported the secession of Panama through the use of the U.S. navy. Senator Edward Carmack was quoted as saying, \\"There never was any real insurrection in Panama. To all intents and purposes [sic] there was but one man in that insurrection, and that man was the President of the United States.\\" bisected Panama and led to incidents such as Martyrs' Day and the United States invasion of Panama. Roosevelt was able to reverse a previous decision by the Walker Commission in favour of a Nicaragua Canal and pushed through the acquisition of the French Panama Canal effort. Panama was then part of Colombia, so Roosevelt opened negotiations with the Colombians to obtain the necessary permission. In early 1903, the Hay–Herrán Treaty was signed by both nations, but the Colombian Senate failed to ratify the treaty. Controversially, Roosevelt implied to Panamanian rebels that if they revolted, the U.S. Navy would assist their cause for independence. Panama proceeded to proclaim its independence on November 3, 1903, and the in local waters impeded any interference from Colombia. The victorious Panamanians returned the favor to Roosevelt by allowing the United States control of the Panama Canal Zone on February 23, 1904, for US$10,000,000 (as provided in the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty, signed on November 18, 1903). =Roosevelt Corollary= When the Venezuelan government under Cipriano Castro was no longer able to placate the demands of European bankers in 1902, naval forces from Britain, Italy, and Germany erected a blockade along the Venezuelan coast and even fired upon coastal fortifications. The U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt's concern with the threat of penetration into the region by Germany and the increasingly negative British and American press reactions to the affair led to the blockading nations agreement to a compromise. The blockade was maintained during negotiations over the details of refinacial the debt on Washington Protocols. The U.S. president then formulated the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, in December 1904, which asserted the right of the United States to intervene in Latin American nations' affairs.Glickman, Robert Jay. Norteamérica vis-à-vis Hispanoamérica: ¿oposición o asociación? Toronto: Canadian Academy of the Arts, 2005. In its altered state, the Monroe Doctrine would now consider Latin America as an agency for expanding U.S. commercial interests in the region, along with its original stated purpose of keeping European hegemony from the hemisphere. In addition, the corollary proclaimed the explicit right of the United States to intervene in Latin American conflicts exercising an international police power. Roosevelt first used the Corollary to act in the Dominican Republic in 1904, which at the time was severely indebted and becoming a failed state. = Dollar Diplomacy = From 1909 to 1913, President William Howard Taft and Secretary of State Philander C. Knox followed a foreign policy characterized as \\"dollar diplomacy.\\" Taft shared the view held by Knox (a corporate lawyer who had founded the giant conglomerate U.S. Steel) that the goal of diplomacy should be to create stability abroad and, through this stability, promote American commercial interests. Knox felt that not only was the goal of diplomacy to improve financial opportunities, but also to use private capital to further U.S. interests overseas. \\"Dollar diplomacy\\" was evident in extensive U.S. interventions in Cuba, Central America and Venezuela, especially in measures undertaken by the United States government to safeguard American financial interests in the region. During the presidency of Juan Vicente Gómez, Venezuela provided a very favorable atmosphere for U.S. activities, as at that time petroleum was discovered under Lake Maracaibo basin in 1914. Gómez managed to deflate Venezuela's staggering debt by granting concessions to foreign oil companies, which won him the support of the United States and the European powers. The growth of the domestic oil industry strengthened the economic ties between the U.S. and Venezuela.http://www.adst.org/Readers/Venezuela.pdf In spite of successes, \\"dollar diplomacy\\" failed to counteract economic instability and the tide of revolution in places like Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua and China. =Mexican Revolution (1910–1920)= 1917 political cartoon about the Zimmermann Telegram published in the Dallas Morning News The United States appears to have pursued an inconsistent policy toward Mexico during the Mexican Revolution, but in fact it was the pattern for U.S. diplomacy. \\"Every victorious faction between 1910 and 1919 enjoyed the sympathy, and in most cases the direct support of U.S. authorities in its struggle for power. In each case, the administration in Washington soon turned on its new friends with the same vehemence it had initially expressed in supporting them.\\"Friedrich Katz, The Secret War in Mexico: Europe, the United States, and the Mexican Revolution. Chicago: University of Chicago Press 1981, p. 563. The U.S. turned against the regimes it helped install when they began pursuing policies counter to U.S. diplomatic and business interests.Katz, Secret War in Mexico, p. 564. The U.S. sent troops to the border with Mexico when it became clear in March 1911 that the regime of Porfirio Díaz could not control revolutionary violence.John Womack, Jr. \\"The Mexican Revolution\\" in Mexico Since Independence, ed. Leslie Bethell. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1991, p. 131. Díaz resigned, opening the way for free elections that brought Francisco I. Madero to the presidency in November 1911. The U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Henry Lane Wilson, conspired with opposition forces to topple Madero's regime in February 1913, during what is known as the Ten Tragic Days. The U.S. intervened in Mexico twice under the Presidency of Woodrow Wilson. The first time was the United States occupation of Veracruz by the Navy in 1914. The second time, the U.S. mounted a punitive operation in northern Mexico in the Pancho Villa Expedition, aimed at capturing the northern revolutionary who had attacked Columbus, New Mexico. = Banana Wars = William Allen Rogers's 1904 cartoon recreates the Big Stick ideology as an episode in Gulliver's Travels US Marines with the captured flag of Augusto César Sandino in Nicaragua in 1932. At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the US carried on several military interventions under principles of Big Stick policy in what became known as the Banana Wars. The term arose from the connections between the interventions and the preservation of US commercial interests. An example is the United Fruit corporation, which had significant financial stakes in production of bananas, tobacco, sugar cane, and various other agricultural products throughout the Caribbean, Central America and the northern portions of South America. US citizens advocating imperialism in the pre–World War I era often argued that these conflicts helped central and South Americans by aiding in stability. Some imperialists argued that these limited interventions did not serve US interests sufficiently and argued for expanded actions in the region. Anti-imperialists argued that these actions were a first step down a slippery slope towards US colonialism in the region. Some modern observers have argued that if World War I had not lessened American enthusiasm for international activity these interventions might have led to the formation of an expanded U.S. colonial empire, with Central American states either annexed into statehood like Hawaii or becoming American territories, like the Philippines, Puerto Rico and Guam. However, this view is heavily disputed, especially as, after a decrease in activity during and after World War I, the U.S. government intervened again in the 1920s while again stating that no colonial ambitions were held. The Banana Wars ended with the 1933 Good Neighbor Policy of President Franklin D. Roosevelt; no official American colonies had been created. The countries involved in the Banana Wars include: * Cuba – Sometimes not counted among the banana wars, as the Platt Amendment granted the United States the right to militarily intervene on any occasion in which Cuba's independence was threatened * Dominican Republic * Honduras * Haiti * Nicaragua * Colombia * Panama Though many other countries in the region may have been influenced or dominated by American banana or other companies, there is no history of U.S. military intervention during this period in those countries.  1930s The Great Depression made overseas military expeditions too costly for the U.S. In January 1931, Henry Stimson, then Secretary of State, announced that all U.S. soldiers in Nicaragua would be withdrawn following the 1932 election in the country. The Good Neighbor policy was the foreign policy of newly elected American president Franklin Roosevelt toward the countries of Latin America. The United States wished to improve relations with its Latin American neighbors in a time of increasing international conflict. Giving up unpopular military intervention, the United States implemented its policy of Pan-Americanism to maintain its influence. This policy supported strong domestic leaders, the training of national guards, economic and cultural penetration, Export-Import Bank loans, financial supervision, and political subversion. The Good Neighbor Policy meant that the United States would keep its eye on Latin America in a more peaceful manner. On March 4, 1933, Roosevelt stated during his inaugural address that: \\"In the field of world policy I would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor—the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others.\\"Roosevelt, Franklin Delano. \\"First Inaugural Address.\\" Washington, D.C. March 4, 1933 This position was affirmed by Cordell Hull, Roosevelt's Secretary of State, at a conference of American states in Montevideo in December 1933. Hull endorsed the resolution, \\"No country has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another.\\" In December 1933 Roosevelt stated, \\"The definite policy of the United States from now on is one opposed to armed intervention.\\"Edgar B. Nixon, ed. Franklin D. Roosevelt and Foreign Affairs: Volume I, 559–60. World War II President Roosevelt's policy after 1939 was to pay special attention to Latin America, to fend off German influence, to build a united front on behalf of the war effort, and then to win support for the United Nations. Only Brazil contributed significant numbers of men to fight.Gerald K. Haines, \\"Under the Eagle's Wing: The Franklin Roosevelt Administration Forges an American Hemisphere.\\" Diplomatic History 1#4 (1977): 373–388. online British intelligence knew about Roosevelt's fears and exploited them in 1941 by producing a fake map that indicated German plans for taking over South America. Roosevelt's appointment of young Nelson Rockefeller to head the new, well-funded Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs provided energetic leadership; in practice Rockefeller reported to Roosevelt and largely ignored the State Department.Cary Reich, The Life of Nelson A. Rockefeller: Worlds to Conquer, 1908–1958 (1996) pp 260–373. Anti-fascist propaganda was a major project across Latin America, and was run by Rockefeller's office. It spent millions on radio broadcasts and motion pictures, hoping to reach a large audience. Madison Avenue techniques generated a push back in Mexico, especially, where well-informed locals resisted heavy-handed American influence.Kornel Chang, \\"Muted reception: US propaganda and the construction of Mexican popular opinion during the Second World War.\\" Diplomatic History 38.3 (2013): 569–598. Nevertheless, Mexico was a valuable ally in the war. A deal was reached whereby 250,000 Mexican citizens living in the United States served in the American forces; over 1000 were killed in combat. In addition to propaganda, large sums were allocated for economic support and development. On the whole the Roosevelt policy was a political success, except in Argentina, which tolerated German influence, and refused to follow Washington's lead until the war was practically over.Reich, pp 270–75, 305–17.Randall B. Woods, \\"Hull and Argentina: Wilsonian Diplomacy in the Age of Roosevelt\\" Journal of Interamerican Studies and World Affairs 16#3 (1974) pp. 350–371 online = Expulsion of Germans = After the United States declared war on Germany in December 1941, the Federal Bureau of Investigation drafted a list of Germans in fifteen Latin American countries it suspected of subversive activities and demanded their eviction to the U.S. for detention. In response, several countries expelled a total of 4,058 Germans to the U.S. Some 10% to 15% of them were Nazi party members, including some dozen recruiters for the Nazis' overseas arm and eight people suspected of espionage. Also among them were 81 Jewish Germans who had only recently fled persecution in Nazi Germany. The bulk were ordinary Germans who were residents in the Latin American states for years or decades. Some were expelled because corrupt Latin American officials took the opportunity to seize their property or ordinary Latin Americans were after the financial reward that U.S. intelligence paid informants. Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico did not participate in the U.S. expulsion program.  1940s–1960s: The Cold War and the \\"Hemispheric Defense\\" Doctrine  Jacobo Árbenz attempted a modest redistribution of land, he was overthrown in the 1954 CIA Guatemalan coup d'état It officially started in 1947 with the Truman doctrine theorizing the \\"containment\\" policy, the Cold War had important consequences in Latin America. Latin America was considered by the United States to be a full part of the Western Bloc, called \\"free world\\", in contrast with the Eastern Bloc, a division born with the end of World War II and the Yalta Conference held in February 1945. It \\"must be the policy of the United States\\", Truman declared, \\"to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or outside pressures.\\" Truman rallied to spend $400 million to intervene in the Greek civil war, while the CIA (created by the National Security Act of 1947) intervention in Greece was its first act in its infancy. By aiding Greece, Truman set a precedent for U.S. aid to regimes, no matter how repressive and corrupt, that requested help to fight communists.LaFeber, Walter. America, Russia, and the Cold War, 1945–1992 7th ed. (1993) Washington began to sign a series of defense treaties with countries all over the world, including the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949, which created NATO, and the ANZUS in 1951 with Australia and New Zealand. Moscow responded to NATO and to the Marshall Plan in Europe with a plan which included the creation of the COMECON economic treaty and the Warsaw Pact defense alliance, as well as gathering Eastern Europe countries which had fallen under its sphere of influence. After the Berlin Blockade by the Soviet Union, the Korean War (1950–53) was one of the first conflicts of the Cold War, while the US succeeded France in the counter-revolutionary war against Viet-minh in Indochina. In Latin America itself, the US defense treaty was the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (aka Rio Treaty or TIAR) of 1947, known as the \\"hemispheric defense\\" treaty. It was the formalization of the Act of Chapultepec, adopted at the Inter-American Conference on the Problems of War and Peace in 1945 in Mexico City. The U.S. had maintained a hemispheric defense policy under the Monroe Doctrine and, during the 1930s, had been alarmed by Axis overtures toward military cooperation with Latin American governments, in particular apparent strategic threats against the Panama Canal. During the war, Washington had been able to secure Allied support from all individual governments except Uruguay, which remained neutral, and wished to make those commitments permanent. With the exceptions of Trinidad and Tobago (1967), Belize (1981) and the Bahamas (1982), no countries that became independent after 1947 have joined the treaty. In April 1948, the Organization of American States (OAS) was created during the Ninth International Conference of American States held in Bogotá and led by U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall. Member states pledged to fight communism on the American continent. Twenty-one American countries signed the Charter of the Organization of American States on April 30, 1948. Operation PBSuccess, which overthrew the democratically elected president of Guatemala, (Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán) in 1954, was to be one of the first in a long series of US interventions in Latin America during the Cold War. It immediately followed the 1953 overthrow of Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh. Background: Arbenz pursued an ambitious social program that focused on income distribution and economic nationalism. President Arbenz created the ﬁrst income tax in Guatemala and tried to break monopolies by creating governmental competition. This included agrarian land reform, which meant expropriating over 400,000 acres of land from the United Fruit Company (A US-based, banana production firm). The Guatemalan government determined that the lands had a monetary value of $1,185,000, while the United Fruit Company protested, claiming that the lands' true value was $19,355,000. The central disagreement came from the fact that the Guatemalan government did not place much value on the lands because they were not immediately being used for production. The United Fruit Company countered by arguing that they needed extra acres to avoid soil exhaustion, and to keep the plantations separated to avoid dissemination of plant disease. This conflict led to increasing tensions and arguments between President Arbenz, the United Fruit Company and the US State Department. In the end, the Eisenhower administration responded by approving a secret operation to overthrow Arbenz using some Guatemalan rebel forces stationed in Honduras. Part of the rationale for this measure was that the administration had come to view Arbenz as a communist threat. As would later be the case in conflicts with Cuba, Nicaragua, and other Latin American nations, the potential threat of lurking Communism was more than enough justification for intervention. Ultimately, the rebel forces removed Arbenz from power, nullified his reforms, and United Fruit got their expropriated lands back.Bucheli, Marcelo. \\"Multinational corporations, totalitarian regimes and economic nationalism:United Fruit Company in Central America, 1899–1975.\\" Business History 50.4 (2008): 433-454. Also, the Inter-American Development Bank was established in 1959. In June 1960 the Organization of American States' Human Rights Commission issued a scathing report on violations in the Dominican Republic. Supported by the U.S. State Department, the commission accused the dictator Rafael Trujillo of flagrant and numerous violations of human rights against the citizens of the Dominican Republic. Trujillo retaliated against the chief proponent of the report, Venezuelan President Romulo Betancourt, by actively supporting an assassination attempt. The plot failed and Trujillo's involvement in the conspiracy became public in a report by the OAS Council's (the organization's general assembly) investigating committee. Composed of representatives from the United States, Argentina, Mexico, Panama, and Uruguay, the committee verified Dominican complicity and placed responsibility on \\"high officials\\" within the government. Responding to a Venezuelan call for collective action, on 20 August 1960 the OAS Council passed a resolution invoking diplomatic and economic sanctions against the Trujillo government. The resolution, passed fourteen to one (the Dominican Republic dissented while Brazil, Argentina, Guatemala, Haiti, Paraguay, and Uruguay abstained), marked the first time that the organization had taken such actions against a member nation. As a show of support, President Dwight D. Eisenhower suspended all economic and diplomatic relations with the Dominican Republic. Trujillo was assassinated on 31 May 1961 by a small band of conspirators led by Antonio de la Maza and Antonio Imbert Barrera. The coup attempt that followed failed to seize power and all of the conspirators except Imbert were found and executed by Ramfis Trujillo, the dictator's son, who remained in de facto control of the government for the next six months through his position as commander of the armed forces. Trujillo's brothers, Hector Bienvenido and Jose Arismendi Trujillo, returned to the country and began immediately to plot against President Balaguer. On 18 November 1961, as a planned coup became more evident, U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk issued a warning that the United States would not \\"remain idle\\" if the Trujillos attempted to \\"reassert dictatorial domination\\" over the Dominican Republic. Following this warning, and the arrival of a fourteen-vessel U.S. naval task force within sight of Santo Domingo, Ramfis and his uncles fled the country on 19 November with $200 million from the Dominican treasury.  1960s: Cuban Revolution  Fidel Castro during a visit to Washington, D.C., shortly after the Cuban Revolution in 1959 The 1959 Cuban Revolution, headed by Fidel Castro, was one of the first defeats of the US foreign policy in Latin America. In 1961, Cuba became a member of the newly created Non-Aligned Movement, which succeeded the 1955 Bandung Conference. After the implementation of several economic reforms, including complete nationalizations by Cuba's government, US trade restrictions on Cuba increased. The U.S. halted Cuban sugar imports, on which Cuba's economy depended the most. Additionally, the U.S. refused to supply its former trading partner with much needed oil, creating a devastating effect on the island's economy. In March 1960, tensions increased when the freighter La Coubre exploded in Havana harbor, killing over 75 people. Fidel Castro blamed the United States and compared the incident to the 1898 sinking of the USS Maine, which had precipitated the Spanish–American War; he could provide no evidence for his accusation.Fursenko and Naftali, The Cuban Missile Crisis. p40–47 That same month, President Dwight D. Eisenhower authorized the CIA to organize, train and equip Cuban refugees as a guerrilla force to overthrow Castro, which would lead to the failed 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion authorized by president John F. Kennedy.Bay of Pigs Global Security.org\\"Castro marks Bay of Pigs victory\\" BBC News Every time the Cuban government nationalized US properties, the US government took countermeasures, resulting in the prohibition of all exports to Cuba on October 19, 1960. Consequently, Cuba began to consolidate trade relations with the Soviet Union, leading the US to break off all remaining official diplomatic relations. Later that year, U.S. diplomats Edwin L. Sweet and Wiliam G. Friedman were arrested and expelled from the island, having been charged with \\"encouraging terrorist acts, granting asylum, financing subversive publications and smuggling weapons\\". The U.S. began the formulation of new plans aimed at destabilizing the Cuban government, collectively known as \\"The Cuban Project\\" (aka Operation Mongoose). This was to be a co-ordinated program of political, psychological and military sabotage, involving intelligence operations as well as assassination attempts on key political leaders. The Cuban project also proposed false flag attacks, known as Operation Northwoods. A U.S. Senate Select Intelligence Committee report later confirmed over eight attempted plots to kill Castro between 1960 and 1965, as well as additional plans against other Cuban leaders.Interim Report: Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders Original document Besides this aggressive policy towards Cuba, John F. Kennedy tried to implement the Alliance for Progress, an economic aid program which proved to be too shy signed at an inter-American conference at Punta del Este, Uruguay, in August 1961. Romulo Betancourt's inaugural address in 1959 In Venezuela, president Rómulo Betancourt faced determined opposition from extremists and rebellious army units, yet he continued to push for economic and educational reform. A fraction split from the government party, Democratic Action, and formed the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR). When leftists were involved in unsuccessful revolts at navy bases (El Barcelonazo, El Carupanazo, El Porteñazo), Betancourt suspended civil liberties in 1962. Elements of the left parties then formed the Armed Forces for National Liberation (FALN), a communist guerrilla army, to overthrow the democratic Betancourt administration. This drove the leftists underground, where they engaged in rural and urban guerrilla activities, including sabotaging oil pipelines, bombing a Sears Roebuck warehouse, kidnapping American colonel Michael Smolen, seizing soccer star Alfredo Di Stefano, and bombing the United States Embassy in Caracas. FALN failed to rally the rural poor and to disrupt the 1963 presidential elections. After numerous attacks, the MIR and Communist Party of Venezuela (PCV) members of Congress were finally arrested. It became clear that Fidel Castro had been arming the rebels, so Venezuela protested to the Organization of American States (OAS). At the same time, the U.S. suspended economic and/or broke off diplomatic relations with several dictatorships between 1961 and JFK's assassination in 1963, including Argentina, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras and Peru. However, these suspensions were imposed only temporarily, for periods of only three weeks to six months. However, the US finally decided it best to train Latin American militaries in counter-insurgency tactics at the School of the Americas. In effect, the Alliance for Progress included U.S. programs of military and police assistance to counter Communism, including Plan LAZO in Colombia from 1959 to 1964. The nuclear arms race brought the two superpowers to the brink of nuclear war. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy responded to the installation of nuclear missiles in Cuba with a naval blockade—a show of force that brought the world close to nuclear war.\\"Cold War\\", Dictionary of the Social Sciences. Craig Calhoun, ed. Oxford University Press. 2002. The Cuban Missile Crisis showed that neither superpower was ready to use nuclear weapons for fear of the other's retaliation, and thus of mutually assured destruction. The aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis led to the first efforts toward nuclear disarmament and improving relations. (Palmowski) A Marine heavy machine gunner monitors a position along the international neutral corridor in Santo Domingo, 1965. By 1964, under President Lyndon Johnson, the program to discriminate against dictatorial regimes ceased. In March 1964, the U.S. supported a military coup in Brazil, overthrowing left-wing president, João Goulart, and was prepared to help if called upon under Operation Brother Sam. In 1965, the U.S. dispatched 24,000 soldiers to the Dominican Republic to prevent a possible left-wing takeover under Operation Power Pack. Earlier the OAS issued a resolution calling the combatants to end all hostilities. On May 5, the OAS Peace Committee arrived in Santo Domingo and a second definite cease fire agreement was signed, ending the main phase of the civil war. Under the Act of Santo Domingo, OAS was tasked with overseeing the implementation of the peace deal as well as distributing food and medication through the capital. The treaties failed to fully prevent violations such as small-scale firefights and sniper fire. A day later, OAS members established the Inter-American Peace Force (IAPF) with the goal of serving as a peacekeeping formation in the Dominican Republic. IAPF consisted of 1,748 Brazilian, Paraguayan, Nicaraguan, Costa Rican, Salvadoran and Honduran troops and was headed by Brazilian general Hugo Panasco Alvim, with Bruce Palmer serving as his deputy commander. On May 26, U.S. forces began gradually withdrawing from the island. The first post war elections were held on July 1, 1966, pitting Reformist Party candidate, Joaquín Balaguer, against former president Juan Emilio Bosch Gaviño. Balaguer emerged victorious in the elections, after building his campaign on promises of reconciliation. On September 21, 1966, the last OAS peacekeepers withdrew from the island, ending the foreign intervention in the conflict. Through the Office of Public Safety, an organization dependent of the USAID and close to the CIA, the US assisted Latin American security forces, training them in interrogation methods, riot control, and sending them materiel. Dan Mitrione in Uruguay became infamous for his systematic use of torture.  1970s  Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet shaking hands with U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in 1976 Following the 1959 Cuban Revolution and the local implementation in several countries of Che Guevara's foco theory, the US waged a war in South America against what it called \\"Communist subversives\\", leading to support of coups against democratically elected presidents such as the backing of the Chilean right wing, which would culminate with Augusto Pinochet's 1973 Chilean coup against democratically elected Salvador Allende. By 1976, all of South America was covered by similar military dictatorships, called juntas. In Paraguay, Alfredo Stroessner had been in power since 1954; in Brazil, left-wing President João Goulart was overthrown by a military coup in 1964 with the assistance of the US in what was known as Operation Brother Sam; in Bolivia, General Hugo Banzer overthrew leftist General Juan José Torres in 1971; in Uruguay, considered the \\"Switzerland\\" of South America, Juan María Bordaberry seized power in the 27 June 1973 coup. In Peru, leftist General Velasco Alvarado in power since 1968, planned to use the recently empowered Peruvian military to overwhelm Chilean armed forces in a planned invasion of Pinochetist Chile. A \\"Dirty War\\" was waged all over the subcontinent, culminating with Operation Condor, an agreement between security services of the Southern Cone and other South American countries to repress and assassinate political opponents, which was backed by the US government. The armed forces also took power in Argentina in 1976,According to the National Security Archive, the Argentine junta led by Jorge Rafael Videla, believed it had United States' approval for its all-out assault on the left in the name of \\"national security doctrine\\". The U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires complained to Washington that the Argentine officers were \\"euphoric\\" over signals from high-ranking U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. See ARGENTINE MILITARY BELIEVED U.S. GAVE GO-AHEAD FOR DIRTY WAR, National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 73 – Part II, CIA classified documents released in 2002 and then supported the 1980 \\"Cocaine Coup\\" of Luis García Meza Tejada in Bolivia, before training the \\"Contras\\" in Nicaragua, where the Sandinista National Liberation Front, headed by Daniel Ortega, had taken power in 1979, as well as militaries in Guatemala and in El Salvador. In the frame of Operation Charly, supported by the US, the Argentine military exported state terror tactics to Central America, where the \\"dirty war\\" was waged until well into the 1990s, making hundreds of thousands \\"disappeared\\". With the election of President Jimmy Carter in 1977, the US moderated for a short time its support to authoritarian regimes in Latin America. It was during that year that the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, an agency of the OAS, was created. At the same time, voices in the US began to denounce Pinochet's violation of human rights, in particular after the 1976 assassination of former Chilean minister Orlando Letelier in Washington D.C.  1980s–1990s: democratization and the Washington Consensus  The inauguration of Ronald Reagan in 1981 meant a renewed support for right-wing authoritarian regimes in Latin America. In the 1980s, the situation progressively evolved in the world as in South America, despite a renewal of the Cold War from 1979 to 1985, the year during which Mikhail Gorbachev replaced Konstantin Chernenko as leader of the USSR, and began to implement the glasnost and the perestroika democratic-inspired reforms. South America saw various states returning progressively to democracy. This democratization of South America found a symbol in the OAS' adoption of Resolution 1080 in 1991, which requires the Secretary General to convene the Permanent Council within ten days of a coup d'état in any member country. However, at the same time, Washington started to aggressively pursue the \\"War on Drugs\\", which included the invasion of Panama in 1989 to overthrow Manuel Noriega, who had been a long-time ally of the US and had even worked for the CIA before his reign as leader of the country. The \\"War on Drugs\\" was later expanded through Plan Colombia in the late 1990s and the Mérida Initiative in Mexico and Central America. Contra rebels marching through Jinotega in 1985 In the 1982 Malvinas/Falklands War between Argentina and the United Kingdom, two close American allies engaged in a military conflict with each other. While the United States was officially neutral in the conflict, allegations that Reagan provided intelligence to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher during the war had a key role in the change of relations between Washington and Buenos Aires, as the military government had been actively helping Reagan. The Argentine intelligence service was training and arming the Nicaraguan Contras against the Sandinista government (Operation Charly). The 601 Intelligence Battalion, for example, trained Contras at Lepaterique base in Honduras, under the supervision of US ambassador John Negroponte. While the U.S. was fighting against Nicaragua, leading to the 1986 Nicaragua v. United States case before the International Court of Justice, the U.S. supported authoritarian regimes in Guatemala and Salvador. The support to General Ríos Montt during the Guatemalan Civil War and the alliance with José Napoleón Duarte during the Salvadoran Civil War were legitimized by the Reagan administration as part of the Cold War, although other allies strongly criticized this assistance to dictatorships (for instance in the French Socialist Party's 110 Propositions). Due to the covert U.S. support allegedly given, without mediation, to the United Kingdom during the Malvinas/Falklands war in 1982, a deep weakening of hemispheric relations occurred. In Brazil, this was taken by the academic establishment as a clear example of how the Hemispheric relations worked, leading to new perspectives in matters of foreign policy and international relations by the Brazilian establishment. Some of these academics, in fact, argue that this definitively turned the TIAR into a dead letter, and the Mexican government withdrew from the treaty in 2001 citing the Falklands example, though notably Argentina itself is still a TIAR member. United States invasion of Panama in December 1989 In 2001, the United States invoked the Rio Treaty (TIAR) after the 11 September attacks, but only a few Latin American democracies would join the Coalition of the Willing during the 2003 Iraq War. On the economic plane, hardly affected by the 1973 oil crisis, the refusal of Mexico in 1983 to pay the interest of its debt led to the Latin American debt crisis and subsequently to a shift from the Import substitution industrialization policies followed by most countries to export-oriented industrialization, which was encouraged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the World Trade Organization (WTO). While globalization was making its effects felt in the whole world, the 1990s were dominated by the Washington Consensus, which imposed a series of neo-liberal economic reforms in Latin America. The First Summit of the Americas, held in Miami in 1994, resolved to establish a Free Trade Area of the Americas (ALCA, Área de Libre Comercio de las Américas) by 2005. The ALCA was supposed to be the generalization of the North American Free Trade Agreement between Canada, the US and Mexico, which came into force in 1994. Opposition to both NAFTA and ALCA was symbolized during this time by the Zapatista Army of National Liberation insurrection, headed by Subcomandante Marcos, which became active on the day that NAFTA went into force (1 January 1994) and declared itself to be in explicit opposition to the ideology of globalization or neoliberalism, which NAFTA symbolized.  2000s: Pink Tide  USS Yorktown, a US Navy ship docked at Curaçao in the Netherlands Antilles, in 2002 The political context evolved again in the 2000s, with the election in several South American countries of socialist governments.Socialist takes oath as Uruguay president Neo-liberalism and the New Socialism – speech by Alvaro Garcia Linera (Vicepresident of Bolivia) This \\"pink tide\\" thus saw the successive elections of Hugo Chávez in Venezuela (1998), Lula in Brazil (2002), Néstor Kirchner in Argentina (2003), Tabaré Vázquez in Uruguay (2004), Evo Morales in Bolivia (2005), Michelle Bachelet in Chile (2006), Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua (2006), Rafael Correa in Ecuador (2006), Fernando Lugo in Paraguay (2008), José Mujica in Uruguay (2009), Ollanta Humala in Peru (2011), Luis Guillermo Solís in Costa Rica (2014), Salvador Sánchez Cerén in El Salvador (2014), and Andrés Manuel López Obrador in Mexico (2018). Although these leaders vary in their policies and attitude towards both Washington, D.C. and neoliberalism, while the states they govern also have different agendas and long-term historic tendencies, which can lead to rivalry and open contempt between themselves, they seem to have agreed on refusing the ALCA and on following a regional integration without the United States' overseeing the process.The Aftermath of Bolivia’s Gas Golpe , Larry Birns and Michael Lettieri, Political Affairs magazine, July 5, 2006 In particular, Chávez and Morales seem more disposed to ally together, while Kirchner and Lula, who has been criticized by the left-wing in Brazil, including by the Movimento dos Sem Terra (MST) landless peasants movement (who, however, did call to vote for him on his second termInterview with Geraldo Fontes of the MST, In Motion magazine, March 26, 2005MST calls for Congress-Brazilian people alliance, Radiobras, June 23, 2005), are seen as more centered. The state of Bolivia also has seen some friction with Brazil, as well as Chile. Thus, Nouriel Roubini, professor of economics at New York University, declared in a May 2006 interview: > On one side, you have a number of administrations that are committed to > moderate economic reform. On the other, you've had something of a backlash > against the Washington Consensus [a set of liberal economic policies that > Washington-based institutions urged Latin American countries to follow, > including privatization, trade liberalization and fiscal discipline] and > some emergence of populist leadersBolivia's Nationalization of Oil and Gas , > US Council on Foreign Relations, May 12, 2006 In the same way, although a leader such as Chávez verbally attacked the George W. Bush administration as much as the latter attacked him, and claimed to be following a democratic socialist Bolivarian Revolution, the geo-political context has changed a lot since the 1970s. Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, thus stated: > La Paz has found itself at the economic and political nexus of the pink > tide, linked by ideology to Caracas, but economically bound to Brasilia and > Buenos Aires. One thing that Morales knew, however, was that he couldn't > repudiate his campaign pledges to the electorate or deprive Bolivia of the > revenue that is so urgently needed. One sign of the US setback in the region has been the OEA 2005 Secretary General election. For the first time in the OEA's history, Washington's candidate was refused by the majority of countries, after two stalemates between José Miguel Insulza, member of the Socialist Party of Chile and former Interior Minister of the latter country, and Luis Ernesto Derbez, member of the conservative National Action Party (PAN) and former Foreign Minister of Mexico. Derbez was explicitly supported by the US, Canada, Mexico, Belize, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Bolivia (then presided by Carlos Mesa), Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua, while Chilean minister José Insulza was supported by all the Southern Cone countries, as well as Brazil, Ecuador, Venezuela and the Dominican Republic. José Insulza was finally elected at the third turn, and took office on 26 May 2005 = Free trade and other regional integration = Momentum for the Free Trade Area of the Americas (ALCA) was lost after the 2005 Mar del Plata Summit of the Americas, which saw strong protests against the proposal from members of the Anti- Globalization Movement from across the continent, however free trade agreements were not abandoned. Regional economic integration under the sign of neoliberalism continued: Under the Bush administration, the United States, which had signed two free-trade agreements with Latin American countries, signed eight further agreements, reaching a total of ten such bilateral agreements (including the United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement in 2003, the Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement in 2006, etc.). Three others, including the Peru-United States Free Trade Agreement signed in 2006, are awaiting for ratification by the US Congress.Le Figaro, March 8, 2007, George Bush défie Hugo Chavez sur son terran The Cuzco Declaration, signed a few weeks before at the Third South American Summit, announced the foundation of the Union of South American Nations (Unasul-Unasur) grouping Mercosul countries and the Andean Community and which as the aim of eliminating tariffs for non-sensitive products by 2014 and sensitive products by 2019. On the other hand, the CAFTA- DR free-trade agreement (Dominican Republic–Central America Free Trade Agreement) was ratified by all countries except Costa Rica. The president of the latter country, Óscar Arias, member of the National Liberation Party and elected in February 2006, pronounced himself in favor of the agreement. Costa Rica then held a national referendum in which the population voted to approve CAFTA, which was then done by the parliament. Canada, which also has a free- trade agreement with Costa Rica, has also been negotiating such an agreement with Central American country, named Canada Central American Free Trade Agreement. Reformist Luis Guillermo Solís of the Citizens Action Party was elected in 2014. Solís belongs to a moderate Progressive party and had no link with the far-left, and also kept a friendly relationship with the USA, nevertheless his victory was also attributed to a general contempt toward Washington-endorsed neoliberal policies (Solís, for example, was a staunch opponent of CAFTA). During his presidency Solís established close relationships with some Progressive governments of South America, to the point of leaving the United Nation's chambers during Michel Temer's speech in protest for Rousseff's impeachment in September 2016. On the other hand, the Costa Rican Foreign Ministry has condemned Venezuela's government accusing it of being authoritarian and anti-democratic. U.S. President Donald Trump with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro in June 2019 Mercosur, the trade agreement between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay (with Venezuela currently suspended) is also in negotiations to sign a wider free-trade agreement with the European Union, following the signing of similar agreements with the Andean Community, Israel and Egypt in August 2010, among others. These negotiations between Mercosur and the EU are advancing rapidly again after stalling during the 2000s. On the other hand, a number of Latin American countries located in the Pacific such as Chile, Mexico and Peru have signed the Trans-Pacific Partnership with Australia, Brunei, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and Vietnam. The agreement, originally signed on 4 February 2016, is being renegotiated after the United States withdrew. The eleven remaining members reached a partial agreement on 11 November 2017. = Bilateral investment treaties = Apart from binational free-trade agreements, the US has also signed a number of bilateral investment treaties (BIT) with Latin American countries, establishing the conditions of foreign direct investment. These treaties include \\"fair and equitable treatment\\", protection from expropriation, free transfer of means and full protection and security. Critics point out that US negotiators can control the pace, content and direction of bilateral negotiations with individual countries more easily than they can with larger negotiating frameworks. In case of a disagreement between a multinational firm and a state over some kind of investment made in a Latin American country, the firm may depose a lawsuit before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (International Center for the Resolution of Investment Disputes), which is an international court depending on the World Bank. Such a lawsuit was deposed by the US-based multinational firm Bechtel following its expulsion from Bolivia during the Cochabamba protests of 2000. Local population had demonstrated against the privatization of the water company, requested by the World Bank, after poor management of the water by Bechtel. Thereafter, Bechtel requested $50 million from the Bolivian state in reparation. However, the firm finally decided to drop the case in 2006 after an international protest campaign.Bechtel vs Bolivia , The Democracy Center, URL accessed on March 14, 2007 Such BIT were passed between the US and numerous countries (the given date is not of signature but of entrance in force of the treaty): Argentina (1994), Bolivia (2001), Ecuador (1997), Grenada (1989), Honduras (2001), Jamaica (1997), Panama (1991, amended in 2001), Trinidad and Tobago (1996). Others where signed but not ratified: El Salvador (1999), Haiti (1983 – one of the earliest, preceded by Panama), Nicaragua (1995). = The ALBA = Manuel Santos, Hillary Clinton, Sebastián Piñera and Hugo Chávez meeting on 1 January 2011, Brasília In reply to the ALCA, Chavez initiated the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas (ALBA). Venezuela, Cuba and Bolivia signed the TCP (or People's Trade Agreement), while Venezuela, a main productor of natural gas and of petroleum (it is member of the OPEC) has signed treaties with Nicaragua, where Daniel Ortega, former leader of the Sandinistas, was elected in 2006 – Ortega, however, cut down his anti-imperialist and socialist discourse, and is hotly controversial; both on the right-wing and on the left-wing. Chávez also implemented the Petrocaribe alliance, signed by 12 of the 15 members of the Caribbean Community in 2005. When Hurricane Katrina ravaged Florida and Louisiana, Chávez, who called the \\"Yanqui Empire\\" a \\"paper tiger\\", even ironically proposed to provide \\"oil-for-the-poor\\" to the US after Hurricane Katrina the same year, through Citgo, a subsidiary of PDVSA the state-owned Venezuelan petroleum company, which has 14,000 gas stations and owns eight oil refineries in the US.Chavez offers oil to Europe's poor, The Observer, May 14, 2006Chavez' Surprise for Bush , New York Daily News, September 18, 2005, mirrored by Common Dreams = The U.S. military coalition in Iraq = In June 2003, some 1,200 troops from Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua joined forces along with Spaniard forces (1,300 troops) to form the Plus Ultra Brigade in Iraq. The Brigade was dissolved in April 2004 following the retirement of Spain from Iraq, and all Latin American nations, except El Salvador, withdrew their troops. In September 2005, it was revealed that Triple Canopy, Inc., a private military company present in Iraq, was training Latin American mercenaries in Lepaterique in Honduras.Capítulos desconocidos de los mercenarios chilenos en Honduras camino de Iraq , La Nación, September 25, 2005 – URL accessed on February 14, 2007 Lepaterique was a former training base for the Contras. 105 Chilean mercenaries were deported from the country. According to La Tribuna Honduran newspaper, in one day in November, Your Solutions shipped 108 Hondurans, 88 Chileans and 16 Nicaraguans to Iraq.Latin American mercenaries guarding Baghdad’s Green Zone, December 28, 2005 Approximatively 700 Peruvians, 250 Chileans and 320 Hondurans work in Baghdad's Green Zone for Triple Canopy, paid half price in comparison to North-American employees. The news also attracted attention in Chile, when it became known that retired military Marina Óscar Aspe worked for Triple Canopy. The latter had taken part to the assassination of Marcelo Barrios Andrade, a 21-year-old member of the FPMR, who is on the list of victims of the Rettig Report – while Marina Óscar Aspe is on the list of the 2001 Comisión Ética contra la Tortura (2001 Ethical Commission Against Torture). Triple Canopy also has a subsidiary in Peru. In July 2007, Salvadoran president Antonio Saca reduced the number of deployed troops in Iraq from 380, to 280 soldiers. Four Salvadoran soldiers died in different situations since deployment in 2003, but on the bright side, more than 200 projects aimed to rebuild Iraq were completed. Contingente IX con menos soldados a Iraq , La Prensa Grafica, July 15, 2007 = Bolivia's nationalization of natural resources = 2003 Poster for a photo exhibition of the Bolivian Gas War, which lead to the resignation of US-supportedThe U.S. Department of State issued a statement on October 13 declaring its support for Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada, calling for \\"Bolivia's political leaders [to] publicly express their support for democratic and constitutional order. The international community and the United States will not tolerate any interruption of constitutional order and will not support any regime that results from undemocratic means.\\" This statement followed the death of 60 Bolivians during the police and army repression, in particular in El Alto, the Aymara suburb of La Paz president Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada and the subsequent election of Evo Morales, first Aymara president of Bolivia and opponent of US-sponsored coca eradication programs. The struggle for natural resources and the US defense of its commercial interests has not ceased since the zenith period of the banana republics supported by the US. The general context has changed significantly and each country's approach has evolved accordingly. Thus, the Bolivian Gas War in 2003–04 was sparked after projects by the Pacific LNG consortium to export natural gas – Bolivia possessing the second largest natural gas reserves in South America after Venezuela – to California (Baja California and US California) via Chile, resented in Bolivia since the War of the Pacific (1879–1884) which deprived it of an access to the Pacific Ocean. The ALCA was also opposed during the demonstrations, headed by the Bolivian Workers' Center and Felipe Quispe's Indigenous Pachakuti Movement (MIP). A proof of the new geopolitical context can be seen in Evo Morales' announcement, in concordance with his electoral promises, of the nationalization of gas reserves, the second highest in South America after Venezuela. First of all, he carefully warned that they would not take the form of expropriations or confiscations, maybe fearing a violent response. The nationalizations, which, according to Vice President Álvaro García, are supposed to make the government's energy-related revenue jump to $780 million in the following year, expanding nearly sixfold from 2002, led to criticisms from Brazil, which Petrobras company is one of the largest foreign investors in Bolivia, controlling 14 percent of the country's gas reserves. Bolivia is one of the poorest countries in South America and was heavily affected by protests in the 1980s–90s, largely due to the shock therapy enforced by previous governments, and also by resentment concerning the coca eradication program – coca is a traditional plant for the Native Quechua and Aymara people, who use it for therapeutical (against altitude sickness) and cultural purposes. Thus, Brazil's Energy Minister, Silas Rondeau, reacted to Morales' announcement by condemning the move as \\"unfriendly.\\" According to Reuters, \\"Bolivia's actions echo what Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, possibly Morales' biggest ally, did in the world's fifth-largest oil exporter with forced contract migrations and retroactive tax hikes – conditions that major oil companies largely agreed to accept.\\" The Bolivian gas company YPFB, privatized by former President Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada, was to pay foreign companies for their services, offering about 50 percent of the value of production, although the decree indicated that companies exploiting the country's two largest gas fields would get just 18 percent. After initially hostile reactions, Repsol \\"expressed its willingness to cooperate with the Bolivian government,\\" while Petrobras retreated its call to cancel new investment in Bolivia. However, still according to Larry Birns, \\"The nationalization's high media profile could force the [US] State Department to take a tough approach to the region, even to the point of mobilizing the CIA and the U.S. military, but it is more likely to work its way by undermining the all-important chink in the armor – the Latin American armed forces.\\"  Academic research  In a review of 341 published academic books and articles on US-Latin America relations, Bertucci noted that the subject appears and combined a number of academic disciplines, including history, political science, international relations, and economics. Descriptive and normative research is prevalent, and that in works published through 2008, explicit theory-building and hypothesis-testing was limited. That work reviewed showed a prevalence of foreign policy analysis, especially of US foreign policy, with more limited attention to non-state actors and multilateralism. In her study of International Relations as studied and taught within Latin America, Tickner notes that US IR sources remain dominant in the teaching of IR, but that in research, these theories are commonly adapted and reinterpreted in a \\"Latin American hybrid.\\" She notes the presence of original concepts and emphases; some of these emerge from dependency theory and explore autonomy and international insertion. There are two broad schools of thought on Latin America–United States relations: * The \\"establishment\\" school which sees US policy towards Latin America as an attempt to exclude extraterritorial rivals from the hemisphere as a way to defend the United States. This grouping of scholars generally sees the US presence in Latin America as beneficial for the region, as it has made warfare rare, led to the creation of multilateral institutions in the region and promoted democracy. * The \\"revisionist synthesis\\" school of scholarship that emerged during the 1980s and 1990s and saw US policy towards Latin America as imperial. This grouping of scholars emphasizes the role of US business and government elites in shaping a foreign policy to economically dominate Latin America. More recently, scholars have expanded the use of Latin American archives and sources, providing greater attention to Latin American agency. Previously, empirical knowledge about Latin American policymaking had been limited by uneven access to archives in the region, which has generally improved in recent years. \\"As a result, scholars spent time looking under the lamppost of U.S. foreign policy to locate problems in inter-American relations.\\" The more recent \\"internationalist\\" approach first emerged largely in history and has expanded to political science and International Relations. Darnton has referred to work by Harmer, Keller, and others as an explicit attempt to \\"decenter\\" the study of US-Latin American relations away from a previous focus on US policymaking. These changes also reflected contemporary shifts in international relations in the Americas, namely the rise of \\"post-hegemonic\\" groupings and the salience of China as an outside economic option for many South American countries.

The monumental architectural remains discovered in Doporboteeya (Daparvatiya) archaeological site along with a beautiful doorframe in Tezpur are identified as the best examples of art works in ancient Assam with influence of Sarnath School of Art of the late Gupta period. Gupta influence was prominent due to intense interaction of the then Kamarupa with the kingdom of Magadha. Many other sites also exhibit development of local art forms with local motifs and sometimes with similarities with those in the Southeast Asia. There are currently more than forty discovered ancient archaeological sites across Assam with numerous sculptural and architectural remains. Moreover, there are examples of several Late-Middle Age art and architectural works including hundreds of sculptures and motifs along with many remaining temples, palaces and other buildings. The motifs available on the walls of the buildings such as Rang Ghar, Joydoul, etc. are remarkable examples of art works. Paintings Traditional painting, Assam Painting is an ancient tradition of Assam. The ancient practices can be known from the accounts of the Chinese traveller Xuanzang (7th century CE). The account mentions that Bhaskaravarma, the king of Kamarupa has gifted several items to Harshavardhana, the king of Magadha including paintings and painted objects, some of which were on Assamese silk. Many of the manuscripts available from the Middle Ages bear excellent examples of traditional paintings. The most famous of such medieval works are available in the Hastividyarnava (A Treatise on Elephants), the Chitra Bhagawata and in the Gita Govinda. The medieval painters used locally manufactured painting materials such as the colours of hangool and haital. The medieval Assamese literature also refers to chitrakars and patuas. Traditional Assamese paintings have been influenced by the motifs and designs in the medieval works such as the Chitra Bhagawata. There are several renowned contemporary painters in Assam.

The Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act of 1956 (Public Law 84-830) was an Act of Congress passed to improve mental health care in the United States territory of Alaska. It became the focus of a major political controversy\\"One of the most controversial pieces of legislation tackled by Congress in 1956\\" – Congressional Quarterly Almanac, 1957; quoted in Felicetti, Daniel A., Mental health and retardation politics: the mind lobbies in Congress, p. 27. Praeger, 1975. . after opponents nicknamed it the \\"Siberia Bill\\" and denounced it as being part of a communist plot to hospitalize and brainwash Americans. Campaigners asserted that it was part of an international Jewish, Roman Catholic or psychiatric conspiracy intended to establish United Nations-run concentration camps in the United States. The legislation in its original form was sponsored by the Democratic Party, but after it ran into opposition, it was rescued by the conservative Republican Senator Barry Goldwater. Under Goldwater's sponsorship, a version of the legislation without the commitment provisions that were the target of intense opposition from a variety of far-right and anti-Communist was passed by the United States Senate.Nickerson, Michelle M. \\"The Lunatic Fringe Strikes Back: Conservative Opposition to the Alaska Mental Health Bill of 1956\\", in The Politics of Healing: histories of alternative medicine in twentieth-century North America, ed. Robert D. Johnston, pp. 117–152. Routledge, 2004. . The controversy still plays a prominent role in the Church of Scientology's account of its campaign against psychiatry. The Act succeeded in its initial aim of establishing a mental health care system for Alaska, funded by income from lands allocated to a mental health trust. However, during the 1970s and early 1980s, Alaskan politicians systematically stripped the trust of its lands, transferring the most valuable land to private individuals and state agencies. The asset stripping was eventually ruled to be illegal following several years of litigation, and a reconstituted mental health trust was established in the mid-1980s. Background to the act Alaska Delegate (and later Senator) Bob Bartlett, the author of the original Alaska Mental Health Bill Alaska possessed no mental health treatment facilities prior to the passage of the 1956 Act. At the time of the Act's passage, Alaska was not a U.S. state, being constituted instead as a territory of the United States. The treatment of the mentally ill was governed by an agreement with the state of Oregon dating back to the turn of the 20th century. On June 6, 1900, the United States Congress enacted a law permitting the government of the then District of Alaska to provide mental health care for Alaskans. In 1904, a contract was signed with Morningside Hospital, privately owned and operated by Henry Waldo Coe in Portland, Oregon, under which Alaskan mental patients would be sent to the hospital for treatment.Boyvey, Roger. \\"Mental Health and the Ultra-Concerned\\", Social Service Review, 38:3 (1964:Sept.) p. 281-293. A commitment regime was established under which a person said to be mentally ill was to be brought before a jury of six people, who would rule him sane or insane. The patient was routinely sent to prison until his release or transfer to Portland; at no point in this ruling was a medical or psychiatric examination required.Kominsky, Morris. The hoaxers: plain liars, fancy liars, and damned liars, p. 111-116. Branden Press, 1970. . By the 1940s it was recognized that this arrangement was unsatisfactory. The American Medical Association conducted a series of studies in 1948, followed by a Department of the Interior study in 1950. They highlighted the deficiencies of the program: commitment procedures in Alaska were archaic, and the long trip to Portland had a negative effect on patients and their families. In addition, an audit of the hospital contract found that the Sanatorium Company, which owned the hospital, had been padding its expenses. This had enabled it to make an excess profit of $69,000 per year (equivalent to over $588,000 per year at 2007 prices). The studies recommended a comprehensive overhaul of the system, with the development of an in-territory mental health program for Alaska. This proposal was widely supported by the public and politicians. At the start of 1956, in the second session of the 84th Congress, Representative Edith Green (D-Oregon) introduced the Alaska Mental Health Bill (H.R. 6376) in the House of Representatives. The bill had been written by Bob Bartlett, the Congressional Delegate from the Alaska Territory who later became a U.S. Senator. Senator Richard L. Neuberger (D-Oregon) sponsored an equivalent bill, S. 2518, in the Senate. Details of the bill The Alaska Mental Health Bill's stated purpose was to \\"transfer from the Federal Government to the Territory of Alaska basic responsibility for the hospitalization, care and treatment of the mentally ill of Alaska.\\" In connection with this goal, it aimed: * to modernize procedures for such hospitalization (including commitment), care, and treatment and to authorize the Territory to modify or supersede such procedures; * to assist in providing for the Territory necessary facilities for a comprehensive mental-health program in Alaska, including inpatient and outpatient facilities; * to provide for a land grant to the Territory to assist in placing the program on a firm long-term basis; and * to provide for a ten-year program, of grants-in-aid to the Territory to enable the Territory gradually to assume the full operating costs of the program.Alaska Mental Health Bill, H.R. 6376, January 16, 1958. The bill provided for a cash grant of $12.5 million (about $94 million at 2007 prices) to be disbursed to the Alaskan government in a number of phases, to fund the construction of mental health facilities in the territory. To meet the ongoing costs of the program, the bill transferred one million acres (4,000 km²) of federally owned land in Alaska to the ownership of the proposed new Alaska Mental Health Trust as a grant-in-aid—the federal government owned about 99% of the land of Alaska at the time. The trust would then be able to use the assets of the transferred land (principally mineral and forestry rights) to obtain an ongoing revenue stream to fund the Alaskan mental health program. Similar provisions had applied in other US territories to support the provision of public facilities prior to the achievement of statehood. In addition, the bill granted the Governor of Alaska authority to enter into reciprocal mental health treatment agreements with the governors of other states. Alaskans who became mentally ill in the lower 48 states would be properly treated locally until they could be returned to Alaska; likewise, citizens of the lower 48 who fell mentally ill in Alaska would receive care there, before being returned to their home states. The bill was seen as entirely innocuous when it was introduced on January 16, 1956. It enjoyed bipartisan support, and on January 18 it was passed unanimously by the House of Representatives. It then fell to the Senate to consider the equivalent bill in the upper chamber, S. 2518, which was expected to have an equally untroubled passage following hearings scheduled to begin on February 20. Controversy =Initial opposition= Anti-mental hygiene flier issued in May 1955 by the Keep America Committee In December 1955, a small anti- communist women's group in Southern California, the American Public Relations Forum (APRF), issued an urgent call to arms in its monthly bulletin. It highlighted the proposed text of the Alaska Mental Health Bill, calling it \\"one that tops all of them\\". The bulletin writers commented: \\"We could not help remembering that Siberia is very near Alaska and since it is obvious no one needs such a large land grant, we were wondering if it could be an American Siberia.\\" They said that the bill \\"takes away all of the rights of the American citizen to ask for a jury trial and protect him[self] from being railroaded to an asylum by a greedy relative or 'friend' or, as the Alaska bill states, 'an interested party'.\\" The APRF had a history of opposing mental health legislation; earlier in 1955, it had played a key role in stalling the passage of three mental health bills in the California Assembly. It was part of a wider network of far-right organizations which opposed psychiatry and psychology as being pro-communist, anti-American, anti-Christian and pro- Jewish. The Keep America Committee, another Californian \\"superpatriot\\" group, summed up the anti-mental-health mood on the far right in a pamphlet issued in May 1955. Calling \\"mental hygiene\\" part of the \\"unholy three\\" of the \\"Communistic World Government\\", it declared: \\"Mental Hygiene is a subtle and diabolical plan of the enemy to transform a free and intelligent people into a cringing horde of zombies\\".Marmor, Judd. \\"Psychodynamics of Group Opposition to Mental Health Programs\\", in Psychiatry in Transition. Butterworth, 1974. The APRF's membership overlapped with that of the much larger Minute Women of the U.S.A., a nationwide organization of militant anti-communist housewives which claimed up to 50,000 members across the United States. In mid-January 1956, Minute Woman Leigh F. Burkeland of Van Nuys, California issued a bulletin protesting against the bill. It was mimeographed by the California State Chapter of the Minute Women and mailed across the nation. On January 24, 1956, the strongly anti-statist Santa Ana Register newspaper reprinted Burkeland's statement under the headline, \\"Now — Siberia, U.S.A.\\" Burkeland issued a lurid warning of what the future might hold if the Alaska Mental Health Bill was passed by the Senate: =Further opposition= After the Santa Ana Register published its article, a nationwide network of activists began a vociferous campaign to torpedo the Alaska Mental Health Bill. The campaigners included, among other groups and individuals, the white supremacist Rev. Gerald L. K. Smith; Women for God and Country; the For America League; the Minute Women of the U.S.A.; the right-wing agitator Dan Smoot; the anti- Catholic former US Army Brigadier General Herbert C. Holdridge; and L. Ron Hubbard's Church of Scientology, which had been founded only two years earlier. Increasingly strong statements were made by the bill's opponents through the course of the spring and summer of 1956. In his February 17 bulletin, Dan Smoot told his subscribers: \\"I do not doubt that the Alaska Mental Health Act was written by sincere, well-intentioned men. Nonetheless, it fits into a sinister pattern which has been forming ever since the United Nations was organized.\\"Benjamin R. Epstein, Arnold Forster, Danger on the Right, p. 141. Random House, 1964. Dr. George A. Snyder of Hollywood sent a letter to all members of Congress in which he demanded an investigation of the Alaska Mental Health Bill's proponents for \\"elements of treason against the American people behind the front of the mental health program\\". The Keep America Committee of Los Angeles similarly called the proponents of the bill a \\"conspiratorial gang\\" that ought to be \\"investigated, impeached, or at least removed from office\\" for treason. Retired brigadier general Herbert C. Holdridge sent a public letter to President Dwight Eisenhower on March 12, in which he called the bill \\"a dastardly attempt to establish a concentration camp in the Alaskan wastes\\". He went on: For their part, America's professional health associations (notably the American Medical Association and American Psychiatric Association) came out in favor of the bill. There was some initial opposition from the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a small and extremely conservative body which opposed socialized medicine; Dr. L. S. Sprague of Tucson, Arizona said in its March 1956 newsletter that the bill widened the definition of mental health to cover \\"everything from falling hair to ingrown toenails\\". However, the association modified its position after it became clear that the AMA took the opposite view. By March 1956, it was being said in Washington, D.C. that the amount of correspondence on the bill exceeded anything seen since the previous high- water mark of public controversy, the Lend-Lease Act of 1941. Numerous letter- writers protested to their Congressional representatives that the bill was \\"anti-religious\\" or that the land to be transferred to the Alaska Mental Health Trust would be fenced off and used as a concentration camp for the political enemies of various state governors.\\"State Mental Health Bill Hearing Opens Proposal Criticized as 'Anti-Religious'\\". Daily Alaska Empire, February 20, 1956. The well-known broadcaster Fulton Lewis described how he had \\"received, literally, hundreds of letters protesting bitterly against the bill. I have had telephone calls to the same effect from California, Texas and other parts of the country. Members of Congress report identical reactions.\\"Fulton Lewis, Jr., \\"Criticize Alaska Health Bill\\", Chronicle- Telegram (Elyria, Ohio), March 15, 1956. A letter printed in the Daily Oklahoman newspaper in May 1956 summed up many of the arguments made by opponents of the bill: During February and March 1956, hearings were held before the Senate Subcommittee on Territories and Insular Affairs. Proponents and opponents of the bill faced off in a series of tense exchanges, with strong accusations being made against the people and groups involved in the bill's introduction. Stephanie Williams of the American Public Relations Forum said that the bill would enable Russia to reclaim its former Alaskan territory: \\"[It] contains nothing to prevent Russia from buying the entire million acres — they already say Alaska belongs to them.\\" \\"Woman Sees 'Political Siberia' in Alaska Mental Health Bill\\". Daily Alaska Empire, February 21, 1956 Mrs. Ernest W. Howard of the Women's Patriotic Committee on National Defense castigated the slackness of Congress for not picking up on the bill's perceived dangers: \\"Those of us who have been in the study and research work of the United Nations, we feel that we are experts in this ... you as Senators with all the many commitments and the many requirements, are not able to go into all these things.\\" John Kaspar, a White Citizens' Council organizer who had achieved notoriety for starting a race riot in Clinton, Tennessee, declared that \\"almost one hundred percent of all psychiatric therapy is Jewish and about eighty percent of psychiatrists are Jewish ... one particular race is administering this particular thing.\\" He argued that Jews were nationalists of another country who were attempting to \\"usurp American nationality\\". =Passing the bill= Senator Barry Goldwater, the sponsor of the final version of the Alaska Mental Health Bill The arguments of the bill's opponents attracted little support in the Senate. The Eisenhower administration, the Alaska territorial government and mainstream religious groups were all in favor of the bill. The Alaska Presbyterian Church gave the bill its unanimous support, issuing a statement declaring: \\"As Christian citizens of Alaska we believe this is a progressive measure for the care and treatment of the mentally ill of Alaska. We deplore the present antiquated methods of handling our mentally ill.\\" It also urged the National Council of Churches to mobilize support for the bill. \\"Alaska Presbyterians And Health Care \\", Yukon Presbytery. Retrieved 2007-02-19. An overwhelming majority of senators of both parties were also supportive. The bill's original author, Alaska Delegate Bob Bartlett, spoke for many of the bill's proponents when he expressed his bafflement at the response that it had received: Other senators expressed similar mystification at the agitation against the bill. Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington stated that he was \\"at a loss\\" to see how the bill affected religion, as its opponents said. Senator Alan Bible of Nevada, the acting chairman of the Subcommittee on Territories and Insular Affairs, told the bill's opponents that nothing in the proposed legislation would permit the removal of any non-Alaskan to the territory for confinement. Republican Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona proposed an amended bill that removed the commitment procedures in Title I of the House bill and stated that \\"Nothing in this title shall be construed to authorize the transfer to Alaska, pursuant to any agreement or otherwise, of any mentally ill person who is not a resident of Alaska.\\" In effect, this eliminated the bill's most controversial element—the provision for the transfer of mental patients from the lower 48 states to Alaska. The final recommendation of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs followed Goldwater's lead that the bill be amended to strike all the controversial \\"detailed provisions for commitment, hospitalization, and care of the mentally ill of Alaska\\" included in Title I of the original House bill. This amended proposal left only the transfer of responsibility for mental health care to the territory of Alaska and the establishment of land grants to support this care. The committee stressed that they were not invalidating the Title I provisions of the original bill but that they had been misunderstood, a recurrent theme in supporters of the bill: Thus amended, the Senate bill (S. 2973) was passed unanimously by the Senate on July 20, after only ten minutes of debate. Aftermath Following the passage of the act, an Alaska Mental Health Trust was set up to administer the land and grants appropriated to fund the Alaskan mental health program. During the 1970s, the issue of the trust's land became increasingly controversial, with the state coming under increasing pressure to develop the land for private and recreational use. In 1978, the Alaska Legislature passed a law to abolish the trust and transfer the most valuable parcels of lands to private individuals and the government.\\"Mental Health Trusts Land Litigation\\", The Law Offices of James B. Gottstein and The Law Offices of David T. Walker, 2004. Retrieved 2007-02-19. By 1982, had been conveyed to municipalities, transferred to individuals, and slightly over designated as forests, parks or wildlife areas. Around 35 percent of the land trust remained unencumbered and in state ownership. \\"About the Trust \\", Alaska Mental Health Trust Authority, 2005. Retrieved 2007-02-19. In 1982, Alaska resident Vern Weiss filed a lawsuit on behalf of his son, who required mental health services that were not available in Alaska. The case of Weiss v State of Alaska eventually became a class action lawsuit involving a range of mental health care groups. The Alaska Supreme Court ruled in 1985 that the abolition of the trust had been illegal and ordered it to be reconstituted. However, as much of the original land had been transferred away, the parties had to undergo a long and complex series of negotiations to resolve the situation. A final settlement was reached in 1994 in which the trust was reconstituted with of original trust land, of replacement land, and $200 million to replace lost income and assets. Scientology and the Alaska Mental Health Bill The Alaska Mental Health Bill plays a major part in the Church of Scientology's account of its campaign against psychiatry. The Church participated in the campaign against the Bill and still refers to it as the \\"Siberia Bill\\". Scientology may also have provided an important piece of the \\"evidence\\" which the anti-bill campaigners used — a booklet titled Brain-Washing: A Synthesis of the Russian Textbook on Psychopolitics. =Scientology position= The church's official website asserts that the bill was \\"psychiatry's attempt to establish a million-acre (4,000 km²) Siberia-type camp for mental health patients in Alaska, far from the prying eyes of civil libertarians\\" \\"Standing Up for Human Rights: Social Reform \\", Church of Scientology International. Retrieved 2007-02-19 which \\"presumably ... was far enough away from the well- traveled roads of the world to allow psychiatrists to conduct their mind control and other experiments on a captive population, unhindered by the glare of publicity.\\" \\"The Battle Mounts \\", Church of Scientology International. Retrieved 2007-02-19. It would give psychiatrists the power to ensure that \\"Any man, woman or child could be seized and sent without trial to Alaska, deprived of human and civil rights and detained forever, all without trial or examination.\\"L. Ron Hubbard, \\"A Reason Psychiatric Front Groups Attack Scientology\\", February 27, 1969. According to the Church's Freedom Magazine: Church officials have stated their belief that the American Psychiatric Association intensified its \\"interest in destroying Dianetics and Scientology organizations ... when the Church of Scientology actively opposed a bill whose introduction in Congress had been secure by the APA. ... The APA was well aware of who was behind the massive response that defeated the legislation, and they never forgot, as can be seen from some of the attacks its members generated.\\"Heber C. Jentzsch, \\"Scientology\\", p. 141 in New Religious Movements and Religious Liberty in America, ed. Barry Hankins, Derek Davis. =Miscavige on Nightline= Similarly, David Miscavige, the church's leader, in 1992 told Ted Koppel in an interview on the Nightline program: =Conspiracy theories= In Ron's Journal 67, Hubbard identified \\"the people behind the Siberia Bill\\", who he asserted were :less than twelve men. They are members of the Bank of England and other higher financial circles. They own and control newspaper chains, and they are, oddly enough, directors in all the mental health groups in the world which have sprung up. Now these chaps are very interesting fellows: They have fantastically corrupt backgrounds; illegitimate children; government graft; a very unsavory lot. And they apparently, sometime in the rather distant past, had determined on a course of action. Being in control of most of the gold supplies of the planet, they entered upon a program of bringing every government to bankruptcy and under their thumb, so that no government would be able to act politically without their permission.Hubbard, Ron's Journal 67, lecture of September 20, 1967. According to David Miscavige, the bill was the product of a conspiracy by the American Psychiatric Association. In a public address in 1995, he told Scientologists that it was \\"in 1955 that the agents for the American Psychiatric Association met on Capitol Hill to ram home the infamous Siberia Bill, calling for a secret concentration camp in the wastes of Alaska.\\" It was \\"here that Mr. Hubbard, as the leader of a new and dynamic religious movement, knocked that Siberia Bill right out of the ring — inflicting a blow they would never forget.\\" \\"David Miscavige's Address from the Grand Opening of The Church of Scientology, D.C.\\", October 21, 1995. Church of Scientology Washington, D.C. Retrieved 2007-07-18. The assertion that Scientologists defeated the bill is made frequently in Scientology literature. See e.g. 1 \\"Dianetics Services and Books by L. Ron Hubbard \\", Church of Scientology International: \\"In November 1956, shortly after Scientologists had worked to prevent and successfully prevented the passage of a \\"Siberia Bill\\" in the USA\\".

In fact, the original version of the bill with the offending Title I commitment provisions only passed the House of Representatives; it was subsequently amended in conference to strike the commitment portion and retain the transfer of responsibility for mental health care. The revised bill passed easily without further changes. = Contemporary publications = Contemporary Church publications suggest that although Hubbard was tracking progress of the bill at least as early as February 1956, Scientology did not become involved in the controversy until the start of March 1956, over two months after the American Public Relations Forum had first publicized the bill. A March \\"Professional Auditor's Bulletin\\" issued by Hubbard, who was staying in Dublin at the time, includes a telegram from his Washington-based son L. Ron Hubbard, Jr. and two other Scientologists alerting him to the upcoming February Senate hearings: Although the church says that Scientologists led the opposition to the bill, the Congressional Record's account of the Senate hearings into the bill does not mention the church. A contemporary review of the opposition to the bill likewise attributes the lead role elsewhere and to right-wing groups, rather than the \\"civil liberties\\" organizations cited by the church: See also *Citizens Commission on Human Rights *Scientology and psychiatry *Scientology controversies *Water fluoridation controversy References External links * Alaska Mental Health Trust Authority * Mental Health Trust Land Office * Nightline: A Conversation with David Miscavige, February 14, 1992, interviewed by Ted Koppel – Miscavige discussing the Church of Scientology's view of the Act.

Commissioned under the patronage of King Siva Singha (1713-1744 C.E.) and his queen consort Phuleswari, it deals with the management and care of elephants in the royal stables.Barkaith, S. (1734). Hastividyarnava. Edited with an introduction by P.C. Choudhury. Guwahati: Publication Board, Assam. The Hastividyārnava is a work that arose in a matrix of disciplined study, prolonged observation and a precedent tradition. The commission of such a treatise was perhaps considered important as the elephant played an important role in affirming the idea of monarchy and exercising state power.Barua, M. (2005). The Elephant in Assamese History and Mythology. Kaziranga National Park Centenary Celebration Volume P. 34-39. Forest Department of Assam, Govt. of Assam.  Contents  The treatise itself was written for a ruling monarch, and almost entirely from the view of sustaining monarchy – which elephants are suitable for the kingdom, how they should be trained for use by the nobility and for the purpose of war. The Hastividyārnava has an elaborate taxonomic system describing the various types of elephants and their character, and it was perhaps considered important for a king to have knowledge regarding elephants, as it is mentioned that only the learned king recognizes particular breeds.  Artists  The two artists Dilbar and Dosai who painted the manuscript were probably not very familiar with the landscape of Assam and hence the quality of the landscapes are not of a very high standard.  Current location and status  The manuscript is currently housed in the Department of Historical and Antiquarian Studies (DHAS) in Guwahati, Assam.

He has studied literacy and the struggles of working-class America. Rose is currently a Research Professor of Social Research Methodology in the UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies. He is a graduate of Loyola Marymount University (B.A.), the University of Southern California (M.S.), and the University of California, Los Angeles (M.A. and Ph.D.).Cf. biography on Rose's website  Early life  Mike Rose was born in 1944 in Altoona, Pennsylvania to Italian immigrants Tommy Rose and Meraglio Rose. At the age of seven, Rose with his family relocated to a working-class neighborhood in South Los Angeles. Rose drifted uneventfully through most of his early education. Through a mix up in test scores with another student with the same surname, Rose was placed in a vocational education track upon entering high school at Our Lady of Mercy. After several years, a teacher looked at Rose's records and discovered that Rose had been misplaced in the vocational track. Rose was moved out of the vocational education track and began the following school year in the college prep track. Once in the college prep track, a dedicated English teacher his senior year, Jack MacFarland, soon pushed Rose to reevaluate himself and helped him get admitted as a probationary student to Loyola University. This change in perspective proved to be a turning point for Rose who would then go on to earn a bachelor's degree from Loyola University of Los Angeles and win a graduate fellowship in English at the University of California, Los Angeles. Rose wrote a memoir essay about his awakening as a reader and writer entitled \\"I Just Wanna Be Average.\\"  Teaching career  In time Rose became disaffected with academia and left graduate study to embark on a series of jobs teaching writing to underprivileged and underprepared students in inner-city Los Angeles. Over the next several years Rose would teach everything from elementary writing to basic adult literacy. In time, Rose accepted a position as a director at UCLA’s tutoring center where he was instrumental in shaping tutor training and policy. In 1981 Rose received his PhD in education from UCLA and in 1994 was hired as a faculty member in the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies. Mike Rose has been teaching for nearly forty years.  Contributions to the Field of Education  One of Rose’s most significant contributions is his reevaluation of remedial writers. In his bestselling book, Lives on the Boundary, Rose argues that remedial students lack literacy skills not through a shortage of intelligence but because of a history of poor education and a lack of supportive social and economic conditions. Rose challenges educators to have increased confidence in such students and calls for greater equality in educational opportunities. In addition, Rose’s work has questioned prevailing methods of teaching literacy to unprepared students. Rose questions the effectiveness of skill and drill curricula that are primarily focused on grammar and usage. Instead, Rose argues that basic writers should be pushed to engage in a meaningful composition that draws on critical thinking. During the last decade, Rose has also written widely on the importance of public education in a democracy and on the need for a more humane philosophy of education that goes beyond economic benefit and learning as measured by standardized test scores. Most recently he has been writing about the intelligence involved in doing blue- collar work, like waitress, plumbing, welding, and calls into question our standard definitions of intelligence, the way we define \\"skilled\\" work, and the separation of the school curriculum into the \\"vocational\\" and the \\"academic.\\"  Awards  Rose’s research has been widely recognized, and he is the recipient of the National Council of Teachers of English David H. Russell Award for Distinguished Research in the Teaching of English, the American Educational Research Association's Distinguished Lectureship, UCLA’s Distinguished Teaching Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship, the University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award in Education, and the Commonwealth Club of California Award for Literary Excellence in Nonfiction.

He served as the party's leader (and Leader of the Opposition) for little over a month in 1923, during an internal dispute. He had earlier served as deputy leader and as Minister for Public Health under James Dooley. Early life The second son of John Patrick McGirr, a farmer, and Mary (née O'Sullivan) McGirr, both Irish emigrants, Greg McGirr was born in Parkes, New South Wales, and educated at St Joseph's Convent, Parkes, and St Stanislaus' College, Bathurst. He graduated in pharmacy from the University of Sydney in 1904. James McGirr, Premier of that state from 1947 to 1952, was one of his younger brothers. Another brother, Patrick, was also a New South Wales politician. McGirr opened chemist shops at Parkes, Peak Hill, Orange, Narromine, and eventually Sydney. He was heavily involved in land and stock trading. Politics McGirr joined the Labor Party and in 1910 ran unsuccessfully for the seat of Orange. He won Yass at a by-election in 1913. In 1914 he married Rachel Rittenburg Miller, a schoolteacher. The couple had nine children. He was ALP whip from 1916 until 1917. At the 1920 election proportional representation was introduced and the Yass electorate was absorbed into an expanded multi-member electoral district of Cootamundra, and he won a seat, helping to defeat the former Labor leader, turned Nationalist William Holman. Labor won the election he became Minister for Public Health and Motherhood until the defeat of the Government in the 1922 election. He was named deputy party leader after the death of John Storey in 1921. McGirr was supported by Jack Bailey, an influential member of the Australian Workers Union that dominated the State Executive of the Labor Party, who helped McGirr win Labor pre-selection for Sydney. McGirr won a seat at the 1922 election, at the expense of Michael Burke, who was popular within the Labor Party. James Dooley, the former premier and leader of the Labor Party accused the State Executive of corruption and the State Executive responded by expelling Dooley from the party in March 1923 and appointing McGirr as the new leader. His leadership was brief however as in April 1923 the Federal Executive intervened in the NSW branch and Bill Dunn was appointed interim leader, pending a caucus vote. At the 1923 conference, Dooley was re- admitted to the party, and the State Executive was replaced. Jack Lang became party leader in July 1923. Bailey was accused of being involved with a ballot box scandal that would end in his expulsion from the Labor Party. Without the support of Bailey and the AWU on the State Executive, McGirr was isolated and resigned from the party in July 1923 and established the \\"Young Australia Party\\". He was defeated at the 1925 election and subsequently concentrated on his business interests, except for an unsuccessful attempt to win Calare for the State (Hughes-Evans) Labor Party in September 1940.

This detector extended the range of the observable spectrum to much longer wavelengths. Early life and education Born on November 23, 1933 in Mobile, Alabama, Low grew up as a child in Houston, Texas. His undergraduate studies in physics were at Yale University and he obtained his Doctor of Philosophy degree in physics from Rice University in 1959. Infrared astronomy He started working at Texas Instruments in 1961, where one of his early projects was the development of a low-temperature thermometer that was developed using a germanium semiconductor that had been doped with small quantities of gallium, which measured changes in temperature based on the change in the device's electrical resistance as energy was absorbed. Based on his academic experiences, he came to the conclusion that the technology behind this thermometer could be integrated as the basis for a bolometer that could be used to measure the radiant energy coming from stars as infrared radiation, waves that occupy a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum whose wavelength is longer than for visible light (400–700 nm), but shorter than those of terahertz radiation (100 µm – 1 mm) or microwaves. Astronomers had been trying to find measures to detect infrared radiation for years, and Low went to the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia in 1962 to test his bolometer, more sensitive to infrared than detectors previously in use on the Green Bank Telescope, the world's largest fully steerable radio telescope. However, infrared waves are absorbed by molecules such as water vapor in the atmosphere. To avoid atmospheric absorption of infrared radiation, Low developed devices that could be placed aboard aircraft, first using a Douglas A-3 Skywarrior from the United States Navy that carried a 2-inch telescope in 1965 and 1966, and later using a Learjet operated by NASA with a 12-inch telescope on board. Low used the Learjet to make the discovery that both Jupiter and Saturn were emitting more energy than what they receive as solar radiation, demonstrating that both of these planets must have an internal source of energy. Low continued to use the Learjet for research, even after NASA started use of the Kuiper Airborne Observatory in 1975 using a former C-141 Starlifter cargo craft, which is to be replaced with Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), a joint NASA and German Aerospace Center project that uses a converted Boeing 747SP. He had worked at Rice University and at the University of Arizona. He was also the president of Infrared Laboratories, Inc., which he founded in 1967 to make infrared detectors and cryostats for observatories and infrared microscopes as well. He proposed and joined the international project to build the Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS), a project that included joint efforts from the United States, United Kingdom and the Netherlands, which made the first survey of the infrared sky from space, avoiding all atmospheric interference with observations, starting in 1983. Low served as the chief technologist for the project. After an accident at Jet Propulsion Laboratory destroyed preamplifiers used in the infrared detectors, Low led an effort at Infrared Laboratories to develop improved replacement units to resolve the crisis. IRAS was able to discover in excess of 500,000 infrared sources, including many galaxies, and has discovered shells of debris surrounding stars that show the early stages of planetary formation, with debris similar to that later found as the Kuiper belt that encircles our Solar System beyond the orbit of Neptune. Based on these findings, researchers have concluded that the majority of galactic radiation is emitted in the form of infrared radiation that is generated when light from young stars is absorbed by interstellar dust and then radiated from the dust in the form of heat. In 1984, IRAS found that the galaxy Arp 220, located 300 million light years from Earth, is the closest Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxy, emitting 100 times more energy than the Milky Way galaxy, primarily in the infrared spectrum, even though it is faintly visible by telescope using visible light.via Associated Press. \\"Hot but dim galaxy offers mystery\\", The Spokesman-Review, June 11, 1984. Accessed June 21, 2009. Low was named to serve as facility scientist for NASA's Space Infrared Telescope Facility, later renamed the Spitzer Space Telescope. The effort had been delayed by cost overruns, until Low had an inspiration at a 1993 retreat for the project's scientists; the passive cooling technique could be used – rather than place the entire telescope in a bath of liquid helium to cool the unit to temperatures near absolute zero, the unit could be exposed to the vacuum of space to radiate most of its heat while the detectors themselves were the only components cooled using liquid helium, a design change that allowed the Spitzer project to go ahead towards its launch in 2003.Kwok, Johnnie. \\"Finding a Way: The Spitzer Space Telescope Story\\" , ASK magazine, Fall 2006. Accessed April 26, 2013. \\"The rabbit took the form of a warm launch concept proposed by Frank Low in late 1993. In traditional infrared telescope missions, the telescope and its instruments are housed inside a thermal bottle, the cryostat. Liquid helium fills the insulating walls of the cryostat, and the telescope and instruments are already cooled at launch. Frank proposed to let the coldness of deep space encountered in the solar orbit help cool the telescope and put only the instruments in the cryostat.\\" Timothy Hawarden has been recognized by NASA for the development of the passive cooling technique,\\"NASA Awards the Late Dr. Timothy Hawarden for Contribution to Webb Telescope\\", Goddard Space Flight Center, July 15, 2010. Accessed April 26, 2013. \\"Hawarden's breakthrough idea was to do away with the traditional method of cooling space telescopes using huge tanks of cryogenic coolants, such as liquid helium, and instead use a combination of sun shields and radiators to allow space telescopes to lose heat passively; the heat would simply radiate away into cold space.\\" which has also been included in other space probes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope, a partial successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, that will search for the oldest objects in the universe. Personal Low died at age 75 on June 11, 2009 in Tucson, Arizona, after a long illness. He was survived by his wife, three children and six grandchildren.

Community activities The newspaper sponsors a number of LGBT events in the area. Between the Lines also organizes a Same-Sex Couples Wedding Expo, coordinated by one of the paper's publishers, Jan Stevenson. History Between the Lines was founded by Mark Weinstein in 1995. In the summer of 1995, Susan Horowitz and Jan Stevenson purchased the paper during a meeting Horowitz had with Shannon Rhodes, then the editor of Between the Lines. At the time of the sale, the publication was a 12-page monthly LGBT newspaper. Horowitz, an activist from New York City, had a background in publishing as founder of Pride Publishing, Inc. and also served as the first executive director of New Festival. She took over the editorial aspect of the paper. Stevenson, a former corporate banker and first executive director of Affirmations Community Center, took over advertising. Since the sale, the paper has utilized writers that have included artist Charles Alexander, Oakland University communications department chair Shea Howell, and John Burchett, who would go on to serve as Governor Granholm's chief of staff. Horowitz and Stevenson released their first issue as co-publishers in December 1995. At the time, many LGBT people in Michigan remained closeted and the fight for LGBT rights was one that was often fought by individuals rather than organizations. As a result, few people wanted to give the paper their full name and fewer were willing to be photographed. Between the Lines has covered such events as the discovery of protease inhibitors, the decision by the Michigan-based auto makers to offer domestic partnership benefits to their employees, and passage of the Michigan constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex relationship recognition in the state, Proposal 2.

Much of the work is autobiographical and explores Rose’s own challenges both learning and teaching reading and writing. The narrative base helps the reader form a personal connection to Rose, his colleagues, and his students. This book ultimately gives a voice to those marginalized by America's education system.  Premise  Like so many other Americans, Mike Rose was labelled illiterate at an early age. Growing up in a home raised by 1st generation, non-native English speaking parents, Rose encountered deep issues with language barriers from an early age. His humble-beginnings help start Lives on the Boundary with a narrative base that helps the reader form a personal connection to not only Rose, but the individuals this book was written for or on behalf of ultimately giving a voice to those growing up without a voice in the education system in the United States. Elizabeth Auleta's book review of Rose's text was published in 1990 just a year after the original publication of Lives on the Boundary. Auleta writes, ″It is a book about the abilities hidden by class and cultural barriers. And it is a book about movement: about what happens as people who have failed begin to participate in the educational system that has seemed so harsh and distant to them.″ She goes on to acknowledge that Rose asks his audience to place his stories in a larger social context so that the premise of the book extends to any disenfranchised kid's struggle. Rose's book intertwines his story with those stories of the students he mentored during his 20 years as a professor/instructor--Auleta echoes in her review the book's ability to remediate, set curriculum references, teach (even the teacher), and document literacy as a narrative struggle of mastership, observation, and engagement.  Legacy  First published in 1989, Lives on the Boundary has gone on to become one of the most significant books in the field of education. In addition to being a bestselling book, Lives on the Boundary is the recipient of the National Council of Teachers of English David H. Russell Award for Distinguished Research in the Teaching of English. There are many other instances where instructors and research writers have used Mike Rose's literature as the foundation or outline for their own work. Candace Spigelman's ″Discussing Lives on the Boundary in a Basic Writing Class″ explores students vs. the educational system while using Rose's text as an outline. Have You Heard? podcast, ep. #36 ″The Skills Trap\\" features an interview with Rose discussing his book.

In 2003, it was acquired by Window Media, the largest publisher of gay/lesbian weekly newspapers in the United States. On August 28, 2008, Express Gay News underwent a drastic rebranding effort, changing format and name. The newer version of the paper, called The South Florida Blade, was edited by Dan Renzi. According to Window Media, its circulation was approximately 20,000. In 2009 Window Media shut down and shortly thereafter the paper was re-organized with most of the same staff by Mark Haines as The Florida Agenda. In 2010 the original publisher and founder of The Express Gay News, Norm Kent, launched a new newspaper and website South Florida Gay News.  Financial woes  Avalon Equity Fund, an investment fund that owns several gay media outlets including Washington Blade, South Florida Blade, 411 Magazine, David Atlanta, Southern Voice (SOVO) and Genre magazine were found to be in a condition the Small Business Administration (SBA) refers to as capital impairment. This means that Avalon did not maintain the necessary outside investments required under the terms of loans borrowed from the SBA totaling $38M. A lawsuit filed by SBA revealed Avalon had little or no outside capital left due to divestiture by investors, losses in revenue or asset values or a combination of the three. Avalon Equity Fund is in receivership with SBA, which will allow SBA to sell off its assets to satisfy the loans. In November 2009, the paper was shut down because of the financial status of its parent company, Window Media and its majority stockholder, Avalon Equity Partners.

Biography Born in Prague, at the age of six, he began playing the piano. He originally aspired to become an actor, until hearing the Beatles and their lively Mersey sound music and starting a band with his friends. This band was briefly named The Beatles, but soon renamed George and Beatovens. Their western style music was popular with the Czech youth and they quickly rose to popularity as one of the nations most popular bands. especially during the Prague Spring. Their success was short lived. Soon the allies of the Warsaw Pact invaded and the Warsaw Pact occupation began. Afterwards, he began a solo career and his fame continued to grow, despite strict government regulations. The new, more conservative administration, who frowned upon Petr's western influenced music and his notorious hard partying and heavy drinking, encouraged venuesm local and national gigs not to hire Petr to perform. His career reached its peak c. 1975 with the release of his last truly successful album \\"Kráska a zvíře\\", and afterwards it led to a slow decline along with his growing alcohol problems brought his days as a popular and influential musician to a halt. His music suffered after longtime collaborator and lyricist Ivo Plicka fled the country in the late seventies, therefore the quality of his music, his voice, and his songs deteriorated. Although he continued until his death, his musical output never reached the critical success of his earlier work. In fact, many of the albums released in the 1980s proved to be both critical and commercial failures. There was renewed interest in his music after the Velvet Revolution, but he was too ill to re-establish himself in popular culture.

Mission The mission of Philadelphia Gay News is to serve as a forum for LGBT community discussion, and to act as a platform for communicating LGBT issues with mainstream media. \\"My initial goal for PGN was to be the publication that informed our community,\\" Segal said in an interview with Julia Klein. \\"It was very modest. Then as we went on, I began to realize how powerful a communications medium that connected our community together could be, and my goals changed.

The sign will read: “First published in 1976, this early newspaper of the LGBTQ community was an outlet for intracommunication when few others were available. It served as a community- building vehicle at a time when the LGBTQ rights movement was still forming. At the outbreak of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, it became a lifesaving source for a community in need. It is now the most-awarded LGBTQ publication in the nation.”  Circulation  The Philadelphia Gay News is disturbed for free and can be picked up in vending boxes throughout Greater Philadelphia, Easter Pennsylvania, Southern New Jersey and Delaware. = Vending Machines = The Philadelphia Gay News received its batch of around 30 vending boxes in 1976. They were provided for free by the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin, who were retiring and old fleet. PGN’s longtime distribution manager, Don Pignolet, took them to Earl Shibe Auto for painting. The shop was willing to donate paint for the boxes, but only one color: fresh plumb, or RAL-0007. “No one else had that color,” Pignolet said, “and it just seemed so gay.” Pignolet and his father attached the coin mechanisms to the boxes, initially charging 50 cents an issue. Today the paper is free. Throughout the years the boxes have been used as trash cans and vandalized with stickers and graffiti. People have glued the boxes shut and scrawled homophobic graffiti on them, such as “Gay=Got AIDS Yet?” On several occasions, the boxes were blown up with homemade bombs consisting of M-80 fireworks.

It also airs on CNBC Asia between 2.00 p.m.-5.00 p.m. Hong Kong / Singapore time (1.00 p.m.-4.00 p.m. with DST), and in the United States on CNBC World at the respective time, 1:00 a.m. - 4:00 a.m., ET. The programme is co-anchored by Geoff Cutmore, Steve Sedgwick and Karen Tso. Prior to June 2003, the programme ran for only two hours, between 7.00 and 9.00 UK time but later gained an hour from Today's Business. History Squawk Box Europe was in existence prior to CNBC Europe's merger with European Business News. Like the current version, the original version took viewers to the opening of the European markets. This version was hosted by Nigel Roberts. After the merger, it was replaced by Europe Today for more than a year before being revived in 1998. The programme was originally known by the fuller title of CNBC Europe Squawk Box until it was relaunched in September 2004 as part of a wider relaunch of all of CNBC Europe's programming. From this point it used titles and graphics inspired by (but unlike the previously set, not directly derived from) CNBC US' look at the time and the show's theme music was an edited version of its US' counterpart's theme music used between 2003-2005. On 1 December 2008, Squawk Box Europe was relaunched with a new look, logo, and music. The programme became more similar to the US version but the new look was designed specially for Squawk Box Europe. Louisa Bojesen and Steve Sedgwick, previously reporters, were promoted to full co-presenters of the programme at this point, and the \\"News Update\\" segments, which had been axed by CNBC Europe some years previously, returned. On 1 March 2010, Squawk Box Europe, along with the rest of CNBC Europe's programmes, realigned its graphics (and title) with those of CNBC U.S. Bojesen left the programme in April 2010 to join European Closing Bell, and was replaced by Anna Edwards, but she left the network at the end of 2011 and was subsequently replaced by Karen Tso (formerly of CNBC Asia). On 9 May 2011, the programme's format received a major re-working, with the second hour of the programme being dubbed \\"Squawk Pre-Trade\\" and the third hour as \\"Squawk Real-Time\\". The programme's on air title was changed to simply \\"Squawk Box\\", in line with the US and Asian equivalents. On 9 March 2015, Squawk Box Europe launched new titles and new theme music based on the US version. On 27 April 2015, the Asia version began using the US theme music. On 8 February 2016, both the Asian and European versions started using the remastered Squawk Box logo that has been used by their US counterpart since 4 January 2016. Format Since the May 2011 reformatting, the focus has been on the pan-European picture and the STOXX Europe 600 rather than on the national indices. It covers the opening of the European markets at 8:00 a.m. WET where Tso stands in front of the video wall. A guest host also appears on the programme each day (during the second and third hour, like its US and Asian counterparts). Another important element of the show is its interviews with other analysts and CEOs of major companies. Viewers are welcomed to email their thoughts and questions to the show's guests. Maria Bartiromo (who was part of the original US Squawk Box team) served as a guest co-anchor on the show when in London to co-host the annual European Business Leaders Awards until she left CNBC altogether in November 2013. Supplements to the show The host of Squawk Box Europe, Geoff Cutmore, also has a blog on CNBC.com, called \\"Morning Thoughts\\".

One familiar species is Acmella oleracea, which has been widely cultivated for centuries. It is used for food and medicine, and as an insecticide and an ornamental plant. Its common use as an herbal remedy for toothache and oral infections earned it the nickname toothache plant. These are annual or perennial herbs with branching stems usually reaching 10 to 20 centimeters in length, growing prostrate or erect. The oppositely arranged leaves are smooth-edged or toothed, and usually have rough or soft hairs. The flower heads are usually solitary at the tips of the stem branches, or occasionally borne in inflorescences. There are several to many disc florets with bell-shaped throats and 4 or 5 triangular lobes, usually yellow, or sometimes orange. Some species lack ray florets, but some have 5 to 20 or more, usually in yellow or orange, but occasionally white or purple. The disc florets are bisexual, but any ray florets are pistillate.

History The organisation was created in 1927 by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) as the Water Pollution Research Board (WPRB). The Board had no laboratories and fulfilled its remit of providing research and advice on sewage treatment by outsourcing and conducting surveys. Laboratory facilities finally became available in 1940 when WPRL acquired an old house in Watford. During the Second World War WPRL also worked in other areas, notably the creation of a device for airmen to make sea water acceptable as drinking water. In 1955 the WPRL moved to a purpose-built laboratory in Stevenage, and here it is associated with the first systematic analyses of sewage treatment. Following the 1974 reorganisation of the UK water supply industry both WPRL and the Water Resources Board (WRB) were hived off from the Civil Service and merged with the Water Research Association (WRA) to form a quango, controlled by the publicly-owned regional water authorities. The WRA had been founded in 1953 and provided research and advice on drinking water treatment to the municipal bodies responsible for drinking water supply; it was based at Medmenham, Buckinghamshire. The new organisation was renamed the Water Research Centre (WRC). In 1989 the Water Research Centre was privatised and renamed WRc plc, as part of the privatisation of the UK water industry. As part of the process a small offshoot, the Foundation for Water Research (FWR), was created and the Stevenage site was shut down. In 2004 the Medmenham site was also closed, leaving Swindon as WRc's main site. Today the WRc Group employs around 100 staff. Its shares are mainly owned by its staff and UK water companies. Achievements Notable WRc achievements include: 1960s * First analysis that activated sludge nitrification could be mathematically modelled 1970s * Development of first accurate general activated sludge model * Development of the standard approach to minimising the effects of bulking sludge on activated sludge * Only public body of extensive research of trickling filters * Development of the SSVI technique for analysing activated sludge settleability * Development of the first mass-flux based analysis of activated sludge settler design * Development of two standard assessment techniques for sludge thickening and dewatering, the CST (capillary suction time) and PFT (pressure filtration test) 1980s * Water-industry standard techniques for assessing sludge rheology, and a general correlation for rheological properties used in the absence of experimental data * Development of techniques for water mains and sewer rehabilitation, without requiring extensive digging and replacing of pipes * Co-development with the UK water industry of the Urban Pollution Management procedure, the first formal procedure for analysing water pollution at the catchment level, and which was one of the drivers for the subsequent EU legislation behind the Water Framework Directive * Comprehensive capital cost models (TR 61) used widely by the water companies, and recognised by OFWAT as a comparator for company-specific costs Today Today WRc works with a range of customers in the public and private sectors around the world. Its clients include: * UK government and regulators such as: the Environment Agency, Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra), Communities and Local Government, Department for Transport (DfT), Highways Agency and the Office of Water Services (OFWAT). * All of the UK water utilities, many international utilities and companies throughout the water and environmental supply chains. * Waste management and recycling companies and organisations in their supply chains. * European Commission Directorates General including: Environment, Research, Competition, Agriculture and Regional Policies. * International funders such as the World Bank and the Department for International Development (DfID). * Trade associations and not-for-profit organisations e.g. Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), Water UK, Environmental Services Association (ESA) and UK Water Industry Research (UKWIR). * Local governments and authorities. * Blue chip companies involved in agriculture, retail and manufacturing (especially in the food and drink, chemical and pharmaceutical sectors).

There is occasionally a guest host. The show has also let its guest hosts join in on the second and third hour just like its US and European counterparts. Regular contributors include Eunice Yoon (China), Emily Tan (Hong Kong) and Matthew Taylor (Sydney). Interviews with other analysts and C-level executives are also an essential part of the show. History Asia Squawk Box debuted in February 1998 at 8.00 Singapore time in February 1998 when CNBC Asia merged with Asia Business News and it was presented by former CNBC Asia Morning Call personalities Rico Hizon (now with BBC World) and Geoff Cutmore (currently the main presenter of the show's counterpart in Europe, Squawk Box Europe). Bernard Lo and Cecilia Zecha came in to eventually replace Cutmore and Hizon respectively. In October 1998, Asia Squawk Box was extended to 90 minutes and in late 1999, the show started at 7.30 SIN time. In April 2000, Asia Squawk Box moved to 7.00 SIN time. Christine Tan assumed anchoring duties in July 2000 and on 30 October 2000, the show was extended to two hours with the last half-hour being named Squawk Plus. In July 2001, Asia Squawk Box aired for a full three hours like its US counterpart from 7am to 10am SIN time. Around this time, Steven Engel was added to the team as a stockwatcher. In late 2002, Bettina Chua took over as anchor as Christine Tan was reassigned to the evening hours. As a result of the cancellation of Asia Wake Up Call, ASB moved to the 6 to 9am SIN time timeslot. In April 2005, Martin Soong assumed the anchoring duties for the program after Chua's departure from the network. Since 2006, the Asian version of Squawk Box has been guided editorially by Senior Producer Derrick McElheron, who also helped launch CNBC's Worldwide Exchange. As of 2006-10-30 (the same day the Asia network debuted a new graphics package similar to its US and European siblings), the show began using the titles in use by its US counterpart since late 2005, replacing the previous one that was used from 2004-2006. =2007 relaunch= On 2007-03-26, with McElheron at the helm, Asia Squawk Box was relaunched with a new live set, replacing the virtual set it had used since its creation, and a new co- presenter in Amanda Drury. On that day, the show started using the then- current US music package and returned to the 7 to 10am timeslot and being preceded to give way to a then-new programme, Squawk Australia. =2009-2014= In 2009, Karen Tso took over anchoring duties from Amanda Drury, who moved back to Sydney and later to the US after the cancellation of Squawk Australia on June 11, 2010. Former Bloomberg anchor Bernard Lo re- joined the network in early 2010, based out of Hong Kong. He can now be seen regularly co-anchoring Squawk Box. Additionally, Asia Squawk Box moved back to its new/old time slot (6am-9am Singapore/Hong Kong Time) on June 14, 2010. In late-2011, it was announced that Tso was moving to CNBC Europe in London. Lisa Oake re-joined the network as co-anchor of Asia Squawk Box in January 2012. In early 2014, former Bloomberg anchor Susan Li joined CNBC Asia and replaced Lisa Oake (who left CNBC Asia at the end of 2013) as co-anchor of Asia Squawk Box. =2014-present= On 31 March 2014, the show launched with a new live set in Hong Kong and moved back to the 7-10am SIN/HK timeslot. Susan Li and Bernard Lo became the new co-anchors of Asia Squawk Box, which is now based in Hong Kong. Martin Soong, who had been co-anchor from 2005–14, moved to a new program, Street Signs (which also shares the same name as its now-defunct US counterpart). That program is co-anchored by Soong and Oriel Morrison (the latter who herself had previously been anchor of Cash Flow, which was cancelled 28 March 2014). On 9 February 2015, Asia Squawk Box debuted a new logo that is used by its US counterpart since 13 October 2014, but the theme music was originally not the same as its US and Europe versions. That changed 27 April 2015, when the Asia version started using the same theme music as its US and Europe versions. In mid-August 2015, the show briefly launched again in the Singapore Exchange studio after Susan Li left CNBC Asia to join its sister network in Europe as co-anchor of Worldwide Exchange. On 26 October 2015, Lo became the sole anchor of Asia Squawk Box, which is once again based in Hong Kong. On 8 February 2016, both the Asian and European versions started using the remastered Squawk Box logo that has been used by their US counterpart since 4 January 2016. On 3 July 2017, Singapore-based anchor Oriel Morrison joined Asia Squawk Box as co-anchor of the show's third hour. In February 2018, Akiko Fujita (formerly of The Rundown, which was based in Singapore) joined Lo in Hong Kong as co-anchor. On 29 October 2018, Asia Squawk Box once again moved back to the previous 6-9am SIN/HK timeslot following the cancellation of The Rundown three days prior. In February 2019, Nancy Hungerford (formerly of Capital Connection) replaced the departed Akiko Fujita as co-anchor. On 2 December 2019, Sri Jegarajah and Martin Soong became the new anchor team for Asia Squawk Box, which also marked the latter's return to the show as co-anchor, a role in which he previously served from 2005-2014. Soong had previously co-anchored the Asian version of Street Signs since its 31 March 2014 debut following his first stint as anchor of Asia Squawk Box.

Passenger services were withdrawn on 28 February 1966 and the line was closed completely to Ballater on 18 July 1966 and to Culter on 2 January 1967. Construction Deeside line timetable - summer 1963 A railway to serve Deeside was first suggested in 1845. A long line to Banchory was estimated to cost £95,000, or £220,000 to reach Aboyne, a distance of . This was authorised on 16 July 1846, but it was decided to wait for the Aberdeen Railway to open first. Shareholders wanted their money back when the railway mania bubble burst, but it survived because the Aberdeen Railway bought a large number of shares. Interest was restored after Prince Albert purchased Balmoral Castle, to which the Royal Family made their first visit in 1848, and the Aberdeen Railway was able to sell their shares. Investors were still hard to find, but by limiting the railway to a line between Ferryhill, in Aberdeen, and Banchory the Deeside Railway was able to apply to Parliament for permission in 1852. Permission was granted, and the railway opened on 7 September 1853. On opening, the terminus of the railway was at Aberdeen Ferryhill railway station, which was also the terminus of the Aberdeen Railway at the time. The railway was extended north to a new terminus, Aberdeen Guild Street, in 1854. A special train with 15 carriages travelled from Aberdeen to Banchory, and public services began the next day. There were three trains a day, taking about an hour to travel the . First class accommodation was available for d a mile, reduced to 1 d a mile for third class. Initially the service terminated in Aberdeen at Ferryhill station, but this was extended to Guild Street when that opened in 1854, the Deeside Railway paying £700 for the first three years and then £1000 a year for the running rights. Initially the Aberdeen Railway operated the services, but only made one locomotive available, so the Deeside decided to buy its own rolling stock, and this was in service by summer 1854. A new company, the Aboyne Extension, was formed to reach Aboyne, and the Deeside agreed to operate services. Instead of building two bridges across the Dee, as had been proposed on 1846, the railway instead took a cheaper but longer route through Lumphanan. The railway was authorised on 27 July 1857, and services began on 2 December 1859. The Aboyne & Braemar Railway was formed to build a line from Aboyne the to Braemar. This would follow the Dee, and to cross it from its terminus. However, this was modified during the parliamentary proceedings to terminate at Bridge of Gairn with the passenger terminus short at . This route was approved on 5 July 1865, and opened to Ballater on 17 October 1866. Some work was done on the line to Bridge of Gairn, but remained unfinished. By 1855 there five services a day over the long line, taking between 1 hour 50 minutes and hours. Royal services Reproduction of a royal carriage used by Queen Victoria at Ballater railway station On 10 October 1853, the Duchess of Kent, Queen Victoria's mother, caught a special train from Banchory to Ferryhill. This left just after 1 pm and took 16 minutes to reach Ferryhill. The Queen and Albert followed three days later. As the line was extended up Deeside, closer to Balmoral, the terminus became the royal station. On 20 and 24 September 1866 the Prince and Princess of Wales, used Ballater station nearly a month before public services reached the station. The royal trains, which did not enter Aberdeen station but reversed at Ferryhill, took about 75 minutes to travel the to Ballater; the Queen disliked high speed. The line was cleared fifteen minutes before the train was due, the facing points and level crossing gates were locked and stations closed. At first Victoria visited once a year, this becoming twice a year after Albert died in 1861. The number of visits returned to one a year after Edward VII became King in 1901 and the train became faster, although and a slower schedule was later used for George V. From 8 October 1865 a daily special 'Messenger Train' ran when the Royal Family was at Balmoral. This left Aberdeen at 4 am, connecting with a service from London that had left the previous morning, and returned at 2:15 pm to connect with the night train travelling south. First class accommodation was available on these trains; accompanying servants were charged third class fares. The last Messenger Train ran in 1938, subsequently couriers used a motor car from Perth. Great North of Scotland Railway In the late 1850s and early 1860s the Great North of Scotland Railway (GNSR) and the Scottish North Eastern Railway (SNER) were in conflict over the building of a joint station in Aberdeen. Frustrated with lack of progress, the Scottish North Eastern proposed a new line from the Deeside Railway to join the GNSR at . Whilst in discussions with the SNER, a lease on the Deeside Railway was offered to the GNSR, who rapidly accepted. The Deeside board accepted the lease by a majority vote on 13 May 1862, and it was approved by Parliament on 30 July 1866. The Aboyne & Braemar remained independent, although services were operated by the GNSR.

The light is generated by a shock wave in argon or, less commonly, other noble gas. The shock wave is usually produced by an explosion. Argon flash devices are almost exclusively used for photographing explosions and shock waves. Although krypton and xenon can be also used; argon is favorable because of its low cost. The light generated by an explosion is produced primarily by compression heating of the surrounding air. Replacement of the air with a noble gas considerably increases the light output; with molecular gases, the energy is consumed partially by dissociation and other processes, while noble gases are monatomic and can only undergo ionization; the ionized gas then produces the light. The low specific heat capacity of noble gases allows heating to higher temperatures, yielding brighter emission. Flashtubes are filled with noble gases for the same reason. Typical argon flash devices consist of an argon-filled cardboard or plastic tube with a transparent window on one end and an explosive charge on the other end. Many explosives can be used; Composition B, PETN, RDX, and plastic bonded explosives are just a few examples. The device consists of a vessel filled with argon and a solid explosive charge. The explosion generates a shock wave, which heats the gas to very high temperature (over 104 K; published values vary between 15,000 K to 30,000 K with the best values around 25,000 KExplosive-driven shock waves in argon, William C. Davis, Terry R. Salyer, Scott I. Jackson, and Tariq D. Aslam, Los Alamos National Laboratory). The gas becomes incandescent and emits a flash of intense visible and ultraviolet black-body radiation. The emission for the temperature range is highest between 97–193 nm, but usually only the visible and near-ultraviolet ranges are exploited. To achieve emission, the layer of at least one or two optical depths of the gas has to be compressed to sufficient temperature. The light intensity rises to full magnitude in about 0.1 microsecond. For about 0.5 microsecond the shock wave front instabilities are sufficient to create significant striations in the produced light; this effect diminishes as the thickness of the compressed layer increases. Only an about 75 micrometer thick layer of the gas is responsible for the light emission. The shock wave reflects after reaching the window at the end of the tube; this yields a short increase of light intensity. The intensity then fades The amount of explosive can control the intensity of the shock wave and therefore of the flash. The intensity of the flash can be increased and its duration decreased by reflecting the shock wave by a suitable obstacle; a foil or a curved glass can be used. The duration of the flash is about as long as the explosion itself, depending on the construction of the lamp, between 0.1 and 100 microseconds. The duration is dependent on the length of the shockwave path through the gas, which is proportional to the length of the tube; it was shown that each centimeter of the path of shock wave through the argon medium is equivalent to 2 microseconds. Argon flash is a standard procedure for high speed photography, especially for photographing explosions, or less commonly for use in high altitude test vehicles. The photography of explosions and shock waves is made easy by the fact that the detonation of the argon flash lamp charge can be accurately timed relative to the test specimen explosion and the light intensity can overpower the light generated by the explosion itself. The formation of shock waves during explosions of shaped charges can be imaged this way. As the amount of released radiant energy is fairly high, significant heating of the illuminated object can occur. Especially in case of high explosives this has to be taken into account. Super Radiant Light (SRL) sources are an alternative to argon flash. An electron beam source delivers brief and intense pulse of electrons to suitable crystals (e.g. cadmium sulfide). Flash times in nanosecond to picosecond range are achievable. Pulsed lasers are another alternative.

SIFFS is the apex body of organizations of small-scale artisanal fish workers based out at Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala. It has a three-tier organisational structure. With over 6,000 member fishermen, organised through 100 primary societies in eight districts of Southern peninsular India, SIFFS over the last two decades has kept its focus on strengthening the artisanal fisheries. Established essentially as a fish-marketing organisation, SIFFS now provides a range of services to member and non-member fish workers. At present, over 50,000 fish workers including non-members are availing these services, in their numerous endeavors to assume collective control over their own destinies. The tsunami that was caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake off the Indonesian island of Sumatra struck the Indian coast on 26 December 2004. This unprecedented event killed thousands of people, destroyed their houses and property, and made several thousands stranded across the coast line. The death toll in India is mainly in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh. Naturally, the fisherpeople are the worst hit. Thousands have died, several fishing villages were just wiped away. SIFFS actively participated in the relief and rehabilitation activities mainly in Nagapattinam and Kanyakumari districts of Tamil Nadu. SIFFS focussed on these two districts for two reasons: first, these are the districts that have been affected the worst. Secondly, these are the districts where SIFFS has its presence through primary fishermen societies. At Nagapattinam, SIFFS was instrumental in founding the NGO Co- ordination and Resource Centre (NCRC). Policy Research and Documentation forms a thrust area of SIFFS operations. Educating the policy makers, fisherfolk and other people by entering into dialogues with them is undertaken as part of policy research and documentation. To this end, SIFFS has undertaken many research projects, singly and jointly with following objectives. * Promotion of socio-economic, environmental and technical investigation of issues pertinent to fisheries in response to fisheries development and management needs. * Enhance coordination and cooperation between relevant organisations working in fisheries' related activities * Enhance awareness and capacity of stakeholders to ensure sustainable fishery * Raise consensus among stakeholders on approaches to address the sustainable management resources. Documentation Centre SIFFS is in the process of standardising its documentation system. The documentation centre at present has 1,265 books that include 824 fishery related books coming under seven main categories and 20 sub-categories and 441 non-fishery books falling under 11 categories. Year- wise/issue number wise compilation of fishery and general/non-fishery journals has been undertaken and the documentation centre now boasts of 43 volumes consisting of 3,950 articles. Significantly, the compilation includes 3,531 articles extending to 36 volumes spanning across 335 issues pertaining to the fisheries sector. The Documentation Centre also has put together 7 volumes of general journals incorporating 43 issues and 419 articles. The Documentation Centre also maintains 17 files that contain articles, news, brochures and other miscellaneous information. Executive Leadership The first Chief Executive of SIFFS was Mr V. Vivekanandan, who joined SIFFS in 1982 after passing out of IRMA who continued until 1994. Satish Babu, also an alumnus of IRMA, was the next Chief Executive, holding the position from 1994 to 2000. S.Ephrem was the next Chief Executive of SIFFS, (2000-2011), followed by Julian Teelar (2011-2015) and X. Joseph (2015-).

The Northern Yuan dynasty, which existed as remnants of the Yuan dynasty retreating north to the Mongolian Plateau after 1368, had formally came to the end at this time. History By the early 17th century the Borjigin clan had lost nearly all of its power. After his father died in 1634, Ejei Khan and his mother were surrounded by over ten thousand Jurchen cavalry in a surprise attack in February, 1635. Weighing their options, Ejei and his mother decided to surrender and was said to give the imperial seal of the Yuan rulers to Hong Taiji and the title of Great Khan passed to the Manchu Emperors, who founded the Qing dynasty. Ejei then followed the Manchu court's order to ask the remnants of the Mongol clan still fighting the Manchu to lay down their arms and surrender, and he did so successfully. In March, 1636, all resistance ceased and Mongol chieftains from a total of sixteen clans and forty-nine subclans gathered at Mukden, gave their allegiance to Hong Taiji, officially marking the end of the rule of the Borjigin clan. For his contribution, Ejei was awarded the rank of Prince (Qin Wang, 親王), a title he held until his death in 1661, and inherited by his younger brother Abunai (阿布奈). Abunai (阿布奈) openly showed his discontent toward the Manchu and he was put under house arrest in Shenyang by the Kangxi Emperor in 1669 and his imperial title / rank was given to his son Borni (布尔尼) in September of that same year. Borni (布尔尼) was careful to not show any sign of disrespecting the Qing dynasty, but finally in 1675, he suddenly rebelled along with his younger brother Lubuzung (罗布藏), capitalizing on the Revolt of the Three Feudatories. However, they had made a serious miscalculation in wrongfully believing that other Mongols would join them, when in reality only three thousand Chahar Mongols joined the rebellion. It only took a single decisive battle on April 20, 1675 to defeat Abunai (阿布奈) and his followers, who were all killed subsequently in their retreat. The Qing dynasty's punishment of the rebellion was very harsh: all royal males of Chahars were executed, including infants born to Qing / Manchu princesses, and all royal females of Chahars were sold to slavery except these Qing / Manchu princesses.

Biography =As a martial artist= Berwick began martial arts training in 1976 with Shotokan Karate and later went on to study various other traditional martial arts. After becoming intrigued with Chinese martial arts, he began studying under Bow Sim Mark at the Chinese Wushu Research Institute (CWRI) in 1982. In addition to traditional and contemporary wushu, Berwick also practiced western boxing and Muay Thai. While training at the CWRI, he became friends with Ms. Bow's son, Donnie Yen. With Ms. Bow's sponsorship, Berwick and Donnie Yen traveled to China, and became the first two foreign students to train at the Shaanxi Athletic Technical Institute under the acclaimed martial arts champion, Zhao Changjun and his coach, the pioneering wushu champion, Bai Wenxiang. With this training Berwick went on to play lead roles in Hong Kong action films (see below). After returning to the United States in 1990, Berwick’s focus shifted to the internal arts and he became a student of Chen Taijiquan master Ren Guangyi. As one of Ren’s original four indoor disciples, Berwick is also extensively mentored by other Chen family grandmasters, and in 2000 trained at Chen-style Chen Village (the historical birthplace of Taiji), Henan Province, China. In the summer of 2006, the Journal of Asian Martial Arts (JMA) featured Berwick as its cover subject – one of a just a handful of leading Chen Taiji proponents and the first Western Chen Taiji specialist recognized thus. Inside Kung Fu (IKF) magazine followed with a profile written by IKF writer of the year, Robert Dreeben, with Berwick sharing the January 2007 IKF cover with Thai action film star, Tony Jaa. As a Washington, DC-based Taiji instructor, Berwick sponsors a growing number of seminars with the aforementioned Chen Taiji grandmasters, with the intent of continuing to spread authentic Chen-style Taijiquan, as originated and passed down in Chen Village, China. In 2008, Berwick created the True Strength training regimen which promises internal and external physical benefits for both health and combat preparation. The program is available on DVD from DragonDoor. Currently, the first part of the program, True Streng Yang is described as an external body toughening method - to be followed by the forthcoming, True Strength Yin, which is described as an internal qigong regimen. =As an actor= In 1987, Berwick travelled to Hong Kong with Donnie Yen and met Yuen Wo-ping, the action/fight choreographer for later blockbuster films such as Kill Bill, The Matrix, and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. At the time, Yuen and Donnie were interested in moving from traditional period films to modern police-type martial arts movies with a Miami Vice flavor. Part of their vision was to find highly qualified foreign martial artists who could add a contemporary urban feel, and express martial arts creatively at a high standard. Berwick was cast in three of these movies, which represent the early fruits of this vision. Exhibiting highly complex kicking techniques in these films, he earned the nickname 'Vicious Legs.' Although Berwick was set to portray a 'good guy' role in another film, the Tiananmen incident of 1989 lead to the significant delay or shutdown of many large scale Hong Kong action cinema projects. After waiting in vain for the project to begin, Berwick decided to end his acting career and returned to the United States. With the experience gained in the film industry, he has performed, written, edited, and narrated instructional martial arts videos and other media. In 2010, Berwick wrote and directed the short film Final Weapon, starring Ren Guangyi, Michael Woods, and featuring music and an appearance by rock music icon Lou Reed. Filmography *YouTube Montage of Stephan Berwick's Hong Kong Film Performances *Tiger Cage (1988) *In the Line of Duty 3 (1988) *In the Line of Duty 4 (1989) *Final Weapon (2010) =As an author= Since 1996, Berwick has co-authored five books and two dozen substantive articles in various martial arts publications such as the Journal of Asian Martial arts (JMA), Kung Fu Tai Chi (KFTC), and IKF. Much of the material focuses on relating core Taiji concepts and principles that were previously unavailable in English, or rarely seen at best. As such, three of his articles have been listed as select research references in Asian martial tradition by the Via Media Publishing Corporation (Publishers of the Journal of Asian Martial Arts). One of his first pieces, \\"Five Levels of Combat Training in Chen Taijiquan\\", which originally appeared in IKF in 1998, was chosen as a select piece for the book, Ultimate Guide to Tai Chi, (Contemporary Books, 2000). Of special note is his JMA scholarly article presenting analysis and translations (by his student, Chinese linguist Dan Butler) of the classic Taiji writings of Chen family scholar Chen Xin. The article meshed commentary from Chen Xiaowang, with Chen Xin's most technical writings for a martial arts study of historical significance. Previously, Berwick completed primary research on Chen Taijiquan at Taiji's birthplace, Chenjiagou in 2000, resulting in seminal publications such as \\"Chen Taijiquan's Generation X & Y Masters Exposed\\" – the first article to appear in the American martial art press, in KFTC, about emerging Chen family masters, including Chen Bing and Chen Ziqiang and \\"Chen Village Under the Influence of Chen Xiaoxing\\" – the first major profile of the top Chen Village master, in the JMA. Through sharing of his unique access with teaching, research, sponsorship, and a command of classical Chinese martial art skills, he has been instrumental in bringing traditional Chen Taiji to the West.

It passes over the Tonghui River (通惠河). History The bridge in 1860 The exact origins of the bridge are difficult to discern. While the bridge's current structure dates back to the late Ming dynasty, historical records indicate that there was already a bridge at the site since around the fourth century CE. The bridge is located exactly eight li (Chinese mile) from Tongzhou District in Beijing, hence it was called \\"Baliqiao\\" or \\"Eight Mile Bridge\\". It was once used as a marker of the outer boundary of the Imperial City of Beijing, beyond which was the former Zhili province. A small palace and temple complex once stood near the bridge. When the Emperor travelled out of the Imperial City, he alighted from his jiao at the complex and rested there overnight before changing out of his elaborate imperial robes to plainer attire suited for travelling. When he returned from his trip, he stayed overnight at the complex again and changed back to his imperial robes before entering the Imperial City again. The canal over which the bridge stands is connected to the Summer Palace. The Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty started his six boat tours to the Jiangnan region from the bridge. Battle of Baliqiao During the Second Opium War in 1860, on the morning of 21 September, a combined Anglo-French force that had recently occupied Tianjin engaged a Chinese army numbering some 30,000 strong at Baliqiao. A fierce battle ensued, with the Anglo-French force inflicting massive losses on the Chinese army and invading Beijing thereafter. Historians estimate the losses on the Chinese side as about 1,200. The French and British, in contrast, lost only five soldiers. The French troops were led by Charles Guillaume Cousin-Montauban, who was then awarded the title Count of Palikao by Napoléon III. It was at the bridge where the Chinese imperial commissioners agreed to all the demands put forth by the British and French, including the payment of reparations and acceptance of foreign diplomats at the imperial court in Beijing. Baliqiao at present Baliqiao currently stands at the juncture of the districts of Chaoyang and Tongzhou, and has a subway station served by the Line Batong of the Beijing Subway. The Jingtong Expressway runs through the suburb. A pavilion built in Qing dynasty style has been recently erected to protect the stelae with the Qianlong Emperor's calligraphy from the elements. Nothing presently remains of the small temple and palace complex, but its location has been identified, and archaeologists are applying for permission to investigate the hitherto undisturbed site. At present, Baliqiao is in a somewhat neglected state, with graffiti and assorted bills marring its marble construction. Some of its surviving lion sculptures (similar to the lions decorating Lugou Bridge) have been damaged in recent years. There are plans to build a new bridge in order to divert road traffic from the bridge, permitting restoration and conservation work to be carried out, and restricting access to the bridge to all but pedestrian traffic. A museum for the bridge and site is also planned.

If an explosive molecule contains just enough oxygen to form carbon dioxide from carbon, water from hydrogen atoms, all of its sulfur dioxide from sulfur, and all metal oxides from metals with no excess, the molecule is said to have a zero oxygen balance. The molecule is said to have a positive oxygen balance if it contains more oxygen than is needed and a negative oxygen balance if it contains less oxygen than is needed; the combustion will then be incomplete, and large amount of toxic gases like carbon monoxide will be present. The sensitivity, strength, and brisance of an explosive are all somewhat dependent upon oxygen balance and tend to approach their maxima as oxygen balance approaches zero. The oxygen balance is calculated from the empirical formula of a compound in percentage of oxygen required for complete conversion of carbon to carbon dioxide, hydrogen to water, and metal to metal oxide. The procedure for calculating oxygen balance in terms of 100 grams of the explosive material is to determine the number of moles of oxygen that are excess or deficient for 100 grams of a compound. :OB\\\\% = \\\\frac{-1600}{Mol. wt. of compound} \\\\times (2X + (Y/2) + M - Z) where X = number of atoms of carbon, Y = number of atoms of hydrogen, Z = number of atoms of oxygen, and M = number of atoms of metal (metallic oxide produced). In the case of TNT (C6H2(NO2)3CH3), Molecular weight = 227.1 X = 7 (number of carbon atoms) Y = 5 (number of hydrogen atoms) Z = 6 (number of oxygen atoms) Therefore, :OB\\\\% = \\\\frac{-1600}{227.1} \\\\times (14 + 2.5 - 6) :OB% = −73.97% for TNT Because sensitivity, brisance, and strength are properties resulting from a complex explosive chemical reaction, a simple relationship such as oxygen balance cannot be depended upon to yield universally consistent results. When using oxygen balance to predict properties of one explosive relative to another, it is to be expected that one with an oxygen balance closer to zero will be the more brisant, powerful, and sensitive; however, many exceptions to this rule do exist. More complicated predictive calculations, such as those discussed in the next section of the explosive materials article, result in more accurate predictions. One area in which oxygen balance can be applied is in the processing of mixtures of explosives. The family of explosives called amatols are mixtures of ammonium nitrate and TNT. Ammonium nitrate has an oxygen balance of +20% and TNT has an oxygen balance of −74%, so it would appear that the mixture yielding an oxygen balance of zero would also result in the best explosive properties. In actual practice a mixture of 80% ammonium nitrate and 20% TNT by weight yields an oxygen balance of +1%, the best properties of all mixtures, and an increase in strength of 30% over TNT. Examples of materials with negative oxygen balance are e.g. trinitrotoluene (−74%), aluminium powder (−89%), sulfur (−100%), or carbon (−266.7%).

His unpopular reign generated violent opposition due to his harsh restrictions over the Mongols. His alliance with Ming dynasty of China, sponsorship of Tibetan Buddhism in Chakhar and reorganization of Mongolian political divisions were ineffective when the Qing dynasty became the major power in East Asia.

Because his father died early, Ligden was chosen to succeed his grandfather Buyan as khan of the Northern Yuan dynasty with the reign title Khutugtu in 1603. At the time the Khagan's appanage, Chakhar people, occupied Sira Mören valley.C.P.Atwood Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, 2004 p. 88. Ligden divided the Chakhar into right and left wings and built Chaghan city near Abaga Khara Mountain. Northeast Asia, 1620-1630, the Chahar ulus under Ligden’s rule in red line. During his early reign, Ligden had the respect and loyalty of other Mongol tümens. Boshigo jinong of the Three Right Wing Tumens expressed his allegiance to Ligden Khan. Allied with princes of the Southern Khalkha (Baarin and Jarud), Ligden raided Ming China. However, from 1612 on, leaders of the Khorchin and the Jarud became in-laws with the rising Manchus. By the early 17th century, the Khan's court had lost most of its power and was under pressure from the Manchus in the east. Hoping that he could consolidate his power over the Mongol tümens, Ligden moved the Buddhist religious center of the Mongols to Chakhar and had himself declared both religious and political leader of the Mongols by a Tibetan religious leader.Ж.Бор – Монгол хийгээд Евразийн дипломат шаштир, боть III, p. 123. Ligden revived the old Saskyapa order of Kublai's time (r. 1260–94), inviting the order's Sharba pandita, who was appointed his preceptor in 1617.The Mongol empire and its legacy By Reuven Amitai-Preiss, David Morgan, p. 249. Sharba installed Mahakala image in Ligden's capital Chagan. Ligden Khan also built temples at Küriye. In 1618, Ligden signed a treaty with the Ming Dynasty to protect their northern border from the Manchus in exchange for thousands of taels of silver. He received an annual subsidy of 40,000 taels of silver in 1620. Sog Zaisai, a Southern Khalkha nobleman, prince Sanasarai of the Khorchin, and Paghwa of the Jarud attacked the Manchus with more than 10,000–50,000 men to assist the Ming in August 1619, but they were crushed. Because the Manchus wanted to use the Mongols against the Ming, they persuaded their leaders, including Ligden, to ally with them. Since a conflict with the Manchu in 1619, the relations between his clan federation and the Manchu federation had continuously deteriorated. In 1620, after an exchange of contemptuous letters, Ligden and the Manchu ruler Nurhaci (r. 1616–26) broke off relations and most of the Eastern Tümens deserted to Nurhaci in 1622–24. Ligden, on the other hand, by trying to assume this former power, ruled in a progressively aggressive fashion, so several Mongolian tribes opted to form a coalition with the Manchus. When the Khorchin and some formerly allied tribes bonded with the Manchus in 1624, Ligden undertook a punitive expedition and besieged the Khorchin nobleman Oba for 3 days, but retreated when Manchu relief troops arrived. When Ligden Khan called the northern Khalkhas to join him against the Manchus, only Tsogt Taij accepted his appeal. Ligden aimed at centralizing Mongolian rule. He appointed officials to rule the left and right wing tümens, and organized a special court nobility and a corps of 300 baaturs (warriors). In 1627, the other tümens were in full revolt. Princes ruling the Sunid, Uzemchin, and Abaga moved northwest and allied with the Three Right Wing Tumens against the Khaghan. They attacked Ligden at Zhaocheng. Ligden defeated the allies but lost 10,000 Chakhars. When the Ming court refused to pay subsidy, he raided China, forcing them to renew the treaty. The Ming increased his annual subsidy to 81,000 taels of silver. In 1631 Ligden passed the Khinggan Range and successfully attacked the Khorchin and the Tümed. A powerful alliance of Khorchin, Tümed, Yungshiyebu, Ordos and Abaga was formed against Ligden. They destroyed 4,000 Chahar militias in Hohhot and 3,000 soldiers who were going to take Ligden's subsidy from the Ming. In 1632, the Manchu Later Jin Khan Hong Taiji and his Mongolian allies undertook a campaign against Ligden who avoided a confrontation and with maybe 100,000 Chakhar fled to Kokenuur. Ligden made himself yet more unpopular by seizing the wife of Erinchin jinong and taking refuge in the Eight White Yurts of Genghis Khan in Kokenuur. Allied with the Tibetan monarchs, he opposed Dalai Lama V and Banchin Erdene IV. He died of smallpox at Sira Tala (in modern Gansu) in 1634 while marching to attack dGe-lugs-pa order (Yellow Hat sect) in Tibet. After Ligden Khan's death, his son Ejei Khan (Erke qongγor eje) returned and was handed over to the Manchus Qing Dynasty who soon after assumed power in Inner Mongolia.Veit, Veronika (1986): Die mongolischen Völkerschaften: 396-400.

Name  The name is borrowed from the Classical Tibetan term legs-ldan. There, the letters s and l had already become silent, g before d could be realized as and a before n got palatalized. In Mongolian sources, the most frequent ways to write the name are Ligda/en and Linda/en, but the intermediate Lingda/en () does appear as well. a and e are not differentiated in normal Mongolian writing in this position, but a is attested in a strict transcription from Tibetan letters in the chronicle Bolur Erdeni. However, for any Mongolian reader who does not immediately perceive the name to be a loan, the letter g would (by means of consonant harmony and its interaction with vowel harmony) indicate that the word only contains front vowels. This must have been perceived in this fashion at the time of i-breaking as well, as this phonological process took place in back-vocalic words only and would have resulted in had it been . Today, western scholars tend to cling to the written form of the Tibetan word and write Ligdan, while Mongolian scholars will usually write Ligden, both pointing to a possible alternative with n. In Chinese, the name is written as 林丹, the standard Pinyin transcription being Líndān.

Early life  Samuel Osborn junior was born in Sheffield in 1826, his father, also named Samuel, was a partner in the firm of Clark and Osborn, makers of pocket knives, razors, brushes and tortoiseshell combs. Samuel junior did not follow in fathers footsteps but, leaving school at 15, he joined city drapers, T.B. & W Cockayne. After seven years he moved into the steel industry and joined toolmakers Thomas Ellin & Son later moving to Henry Russell & Company where he became a travelling salesman.  Branching out on his own  In 1851 he set up on his own as a file manufacturer with premises in Broad Lane which were named Clyde Works. Within 5 years his company expanded and he rented a six - hole crucible furnace on Carver Street in the city centre, whilst only the following year he set up a tilt and forge in the Philadelphia district of the city, the new site being named Brookhill Works. Osborn, like many other steel makers, showed an interest in his workers health and in particular two of the major illnesses which affected the file making industry: grinders asthma and lead poisoning. By 1864 he discovered an amalgam to replace the soft bed of lead in which the files were placed when being cut by hand. To reduce contact between his workers and lead he developed a file cutting machine although the craftsmen were opposed fearing job losses and a loss of quality in their product, neither being proved to be true.  A new works and a new product  Osborn’s brother-in-law, William Fawcett, went into partnership with him in 1867 and new premises, in the Wicker area of the city, were bought the following year, these taking the name Clyde Steel & Iron Works, this becoming their main base of operations, the large Head Office of the company fronting the Wicker (these buildings still stand and house retail businesses at street level and, above, the Sheffield and District African-Caribbean Community Association). In 1870 Osborn met Robert Forester Mushet, an iron master working in the Forest of Dean where he was producing a new alloy steel, considered far superior to crucible steel. Osborn bought the sole rights to manufacture R. Mushet's Special Steel (R.M.S) and Mushet's two sons, Henry and Edward, moved up to Sheffield to oversee its manufacture. Business was booming with orders created by the Franco-Prussian War and the development of the railways.  The fall and rise of the company  Samuel Osborn & Co's steel melting house in 1917 The bubble, however, burst and in 1874 Osborn was forced to file for liquidation. With industrial development, a new market for Mushet’s Self Hardening Steel was found in America and the company opened a London Office. Taking on new partners and making connections in continental Europe he paid off all his creditors within ten years, the company being registered as the second largest private enterprise in the Sheffield & District Steel & Allied Trades Association. Expanding again, in 1885 he bought and expanded the Rutland Works, in the Neepsend area of the city. Samuel Osborn died in 1891. The company, however, continued.  Overseas Development  Looking for sales potential from overseas the company set up a South African subsidiary in 1919. Based in the mining area outside Johannesburg, the new company was founded to market their parent company’s Sheffield made special steels for industry and, particularly, mining in South Africa.  1960s Rationalisation  It was seen in the mid-1960s that some rationalisation was needed within the Sheffield steel industry, particularly steel founding. With respect to this Samuel Osborn & Company split into separate divisions. Similar moves were taking place at Edgar Allen and Company, Jessop Saville & Company and Hadfields Limited. The intention was to merge the foundry interests of the four companies to form one large steel foundry with the capability of making castings from a few ounces to 40 tons, with only English Steel Corporation's Grimesthorpe foundry in the city able to make larger. As negotiations were taking place the deal fell through leaving Osborn and Hadfields to merge as Osborn Hadfields Steel Founders, with the foundry being located on Hadfield's East Hecla (Vulcan Road) site.

Other diseases in this group are neuromyelitis optica (NMO), Balo concentric sclerosis, and Schilder's disease. The graver course is one form of malignant multiple sclerosis, with patients reaching a significant level of disability in less than five years from their first symptoms, often in a matter of months. Sometimes Marburg MS is considered a synonym for tumefactive MS,See explanation at but not for all authors.

Kermode Wei Qiu, Brain histopathological study and prognosis in MOG antibody‐associated demyelinating pseudotumor, 08 January 2019, https://doi.org/10.1002/acn3.712 Diagnosis It took its name from Otto Marburg. It can be diagnosed in vivo with an MRI scan. If Marburg disease occurs in the form of a single large lesion, it can be radiologically indistinguishable from a brain tumor or abscess. It is usually lethal, but it has been found to be responsive to Mitoxantrone and Alemtuzumab, and it has also been responsive to autologous stem cell transplantation. Recent evidence shows that Marburg's presents a heterogeneous response to medication, as does standard MS. Treatment Historically, acute MS was a fatal disease, with death occurring within a year of onset, often secondary to extensive brain stem demyelination. Treatment recommendations, based on anecdotes, include plasma exchange in conjunction with high-dose glucocorticoids(e.g., 1 to 2 g/day of methylprednisolone for 10 days followed by a slow taper). For patients who survive the acute attack, follow-up treatments include immunosuppression (monthly mitoxantrone or cyclophosphamide) either alone or in combination with IFN beta or GA. Prognosis Marburg variant of MS is an acute fulminant demyelinating process which in most cases progresses inexorably to death within 1–2 years. However, there are some reports of Marburg MS reaching stability by three years.

Julie Amero is a court case in the 2000s concerning Internet privacy and DNS hijacking (specifically involving New.net). The defendant in the case, Julie Amero (born 1967), a substitute teacher, was previously convicted of four counts of risk of injury to a minor, or impairing the morals of a child, as the result of a computer that was infected with spyware and DNS hijacking software; the conviction was vacated on appeal. Timeline On October 19, 2004, Julie Amero was substituting for a seventh- grade language class at Kelly Middle School in Norwich, Connecticut. The teacher's computer was accessed by pupils while the regular teacher, Matthew Napp, was out of the room. When Amero took charge, the computer started showing pornographic images. On January 5, 2007, Amero was convicted in Norwich Superior Court on four counts of risk of injury to a minor, or impairing the morals of a child. Her sentencing was delayed four times after her conviction, with both the prosecution and judge not satisfied that all aspects of the case had been assessed. The felony charges for which she was originally convicted carry a maximum prison sentence of 40 years. On June 6, 2007, a New London superior court judge threw out the conviction of Amero, she was granted a new trial and entered a plea of not guilty. On November 21, 2008, Julie Amero pleaded guilty to a single charge of disorderly conduct before Superior Court Judge Robert E. Young in Norwich., paying a US$100 charge and forfeiting her teaching credentials. Controversy The old computer, along with the school network, lacked up-to-date firewall or anti- spyware protection to prevent inappropriate pop-ups. The school used the Symantec WebNOT filter; however, it was not licensed for software updates and so did not block newly discovered pornographic websites. Computer experts believe that spyware and malware programs hijacked the machine's browser so that it visited pornography sites without prompting and created the computer logs that helped convict Amero. According to the defense's expert witness, W. Herbert Horner, the defense at the first trial was not permitted to present prepared evidence in support of this theory. On March 6, 2007, a $2,400 advertisement appeared in the Hartford Courant signed by 28 computer science professors who said that they think that Amero could not have controlled the pornographic pop-ups. State v Amero - A Miscarriage of Justice? Accessed: 2008-11-17. It was eventually discovered that the uncontrollable pop-ups were spawned by a Spyware program named NewDotNet which had been installed on October 14, 2004, 5 days prior to the alleged crime. Norwich Police Detective Mark Lounsbury is the \\"computer forensics expert\\" who was used by the prosecution to help convict her. Lounsbury testified that he solely relied on ComputerCop Professional for his forensic analysis. By the company's own admission, the program is incapable of determining whether a site was visited intentionally or accidentally.The Julie Amero case, part II: May the farce be with you InfoWorld, December 2, 2008 A paper in the 2007 Virus Bulletin Conference highlighted many other blunders. Amongst the most noteworthy, Detective Lounsbury stated in the trial that a red link proved that Amero had deliberately clicked on the link to visit a particular pornographic page. Huge blown up pictures were shown to the jury. In fact, forensic investigation showed that the link visited color for the browser was olive green. The link was colored red because there was a font tag on the page turning the link red. Further analysis of the cache on the machine and also of independent firewall logs showed that the page had never even been visited, let alone deliberately visited. Thus, one of the key pieces of prosecution evidence was actually completely technically incorrect. An essay on the case by Nancy Willard (J.D.) at CSRIU describes Amero going for help when she was unable to prevent images popping up. At the original trial Detective Mark Lounsbury for the prosecution testified that the computer was never checked for the presence of malware. The case gained national attention when Alex Eckelberry, then president of Sunbelt Software, championed the case on his blog and led a team of forensic researchers to examine the trial testimony and the contents of the school computer's hard drive.

Any chaotic attractor contains an infinite number of unstable, periodic orbits. Chaotic dynamics, then, consists of a motion where the system state moves in the neighborhood of one of these orbits for a while, then falls close to a different unstable, periodic orbit where it remains for a limited time, and so forth. This results in a complicated and unpredictable wandering over longer periods of time. Control of chaos is the stabilization, by means of small system perturbations, of one of these unstable periodic orbits. The result is to render an otherwise chaotic motion more stable and predictable, which is often an advantage. The perturbation must be tiny compared to the overall size of the attractor of the system to avoid significant modification of the system's natural dynamics. Several techniques have been devised for chaos control, but most are developments of two basic approaches: the OGY (Ott, Grebogi and Yorke) method, and Pyragas continuous control. Both methods require a previous determination of the unstable periodic orbits of the chaotic system before the controlling algorithm can be designed. OGY method E. Ott, C. Grebogi and J. A. Yorke were the first to make the key observation that the infinite number of unstable periodic orbits typically embedded in a chaotic attractor could be taken advantage of for the purpose of achieving control by means of applying only very small perturbations. After making this general point, they illustrated it with a specific method, since called the OGY method (Ott, Grebogi and Yorke) of achieving stabilization of a chosen unstable periodic orbit. In the OGY method, small, wisely chosen, kicks are applied to the system once per cycle, to maintain it near the desired unstable periodic orbit. To start, one obtains information about the chaotic system by analyzing a slice of the chaotic attractor. This slice is a Poincaré section. After the information about the section has been gathered, one allows the system to run and waits until it comes near a desired periodic orbit in the section. Next, the system is encouraged to remain on that orbit by perturbing the appropriate parameter. When the control parameter is actually changed, the chaotic attractor is shifted and distorted somewhat. If all goes according to plan, the new attractor encourages the system to continue on the desired trajectory. One strength of this method is that it does not require a detailed model of the chaotic system but only some information about the Poincaré section. It is for this reason that the method has been so successful in controlling a wide variety of chaotic systems. The weaknesses of this method are in isolating the Poincaré section and in calculating the precise perturbations necessary to attain stability. Pyragas method In the Pyragas method of stabilizing a periodic orbit, an appropriate continuous controlling signal is injected into the system, whose intensity is practically zero as the system evolves close to the desired periodic orbit but increases when it drifts away from the desired orbit. Both the Pyragas and OGY methods are part of a general class of methods called \\"closed loop\\" or \\"feedback\\" methods which can be applied based on knowledge of the system obtained through solely observing the behavior of the system as a whole over a suitable period of time.S. Boccaletti et al.(2000) The Control of Chaos: Theory and Applications, Physics Reports 329, 103-197 . Applications Experimental control of chaos by one or both of these methods has been achieved in a variety of systems, including turbulent fluids, oscillating chemical reactions, magneto-mechanical oscillators, and cardiac tissues. attempt the control of chaotic bubbling with the OGY method and using electrostatic potential as the primary control variable. Forcing two systems into the same state is not the only way to achieve synchronization of chaos. Both control of chaos and synchronization constitute parts of cybernetical physics. Cybernetical physics is a research area on the border between physics and control theory.

Family The eldest son and heir of Robert Lauder of The Bass by his spouse Margaret Sinclair, the earliest mention of him appears in the feu renewal by Andrew Forman, Archbishop of St Andrews, Primate of Scotland, etc., to his grandfather, Sir Robert Lauder of Bass, Knt., of the barony and lands of Tyninghame on 28 July 1517, when his name appears in the list of heirs and successors. He must have been an infant. In the North Berwick Protocol Books (NAS-B56/1/1) Robert Lauder younger of The Bass, son and apparent heir to Robert Lauder, of The Bass, subscribed an obligation to William Lauder his eldest brother natural that he shall be seised in the lands of Little Spott, in East Lothian, dated 29 April 1553. C.A.B. Lawder states that when John Sinclair, Bishop of Brechin, died in April 1566 he was succeeded in his estate by his nephew Sir Robert Lauder of Poppill. A long \\"Instrument\\" dealing with the redemption of property in favour of \\"Robert Lawder of Pople, knight\\", dated 9 May 1573, appears in The Protocol Book of Mr.Gilbert GroteThe Protocol Book of Mr.Gilbert Grote 1552–1573, edited by William Angus, Scottish Record Society, Edinburgh, 1914, p. 83, number 326. In this, Sir Robert is specifically referred to as \\"heir of Mr. John Sinclair, Dean of Restalrig\\", and later Bishop of Brechin. Marriage dispute On 24 July 1556 Jane Hepburn (sometimes also referred to as Joanna and Janet) daughter of Sir Patrick Hepburn, 3rd Earl of Bothwell (d. 1556) by Lady Margaret (d. 1572) daughter of Henry Sinclair, 1st Lord Sinclair, was hand-fasted to Robert Lauder younger of the Bass, in the presence of Sir Walter Robertson, Vicar of Aberdour. Robert Lauder became bound by the subsequent contract of marriage dated 12 August 1556, under penalty of £4000 Scots, to complete the bond of matrimony \\"in the face of The Holy Church\\" before Michaelmas next thereafter. However, he failed to do so, and an Inhibition to the recording of the contract, dated 10th was registered 12 September 1556, and accordingly the Mistress of Bothwell (as Jane was styled) brought an action for the amount of forfeit, which was heard on 20 December 1558. She is designated in the record as lawful daughter to Patrick, Earl of Bothwell, and James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, is styled her brother-German. She subsequently married three times. Military and political affairs On 17 March 1565/6, Robert Lauder younger of the Bass, was appointed Captain of Tantallon Castle, the Keeper being the Earl of Atholl. This appointment followed the surrender of Sir William Douglas of Lochleven who was one of those charged with the murder of David Rizzio. Sir Robert had a remission, with other members of his family, for fighting on the Queen's side at the battle of Langside. He was exempted from military service, being \\"hevelie vexit with infirmitie of the gravell\\" 1569–1572. Although formerly a Marian, he became a supporter of the Regent Morton and the King's party in 1572. In 1572 Sir Robert Lauder, Knt., younger of Bass, sat in Parliament.Robertson's General Index to the Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland, Edinburgh 1875.

He was a main promoter of the Glorious Revolution as in 1686 he hosted a group of conspirators who met at Charborough House to plan the overthrow of \\"the tyrant race of Stuarts\\". This meeting led to the Invitation to William, signed by the Immortal seven. In 1675 he married Elizabeth Wyndham (died 1710), a daughter of Sir William Wyndham, 1st Baronet of Orchard Wyndham in Somerset. After his retirement from the military he made alterations to Charborough House, including the addition of a new staircase hall with mural paintings by Sir James Thornhill, and the laying out of a formal garden on the west side. He died without male progeny, when his heiress became his daughter Frances Erle (d.1728), who married Sir Edward Ernle, 3rd Baronet (c.1673-1729).

In consequence of his marriage he assumed the surname and arms of \\"Erle-Drax\\". He was Master of the Blackmore Vale Hunt and ordered its members to dress in yellow coats with blue collars instead of the usual scarlet, and mounted the hunt staff on grey horses. He spent money prodigiously on Charborough, including the building of the famously long boundary wall of the park, said to incorporate about two million bricks; he also built the \\"Stag Gate\\" and the \\"Lion Gate\\" entrances to the park. In 1838 he rebuilt the ornamental tower which had been struck by lightning and extended its height from 80 to 120 feet. At Olantigh he built large picture galleries for his art collection, and added Venetian-style towers and a grand fountain in the gardens.Legacies of British Slave-ownership He built for himself a huge mausoleum next to Holnest Church in Dorset, since demolished by his descendants due to its high maintenance costs.

Mansion house The surviving mansion house is in the centre of the park and incorporates parts of the original house built by Sir Walter II Erle (1586–1665) (grandson of Walter I), Military Governor of Dorchester and a Parliamentarian commander during the Civil War, whose forces besieged Corfe Castle in 1646. Stone and timber were taken from Corfe for use in the house's construction. He fought for the international Protestant cause as a volunteer in the Dutch army, and was present at the siege of ’s-Hertogenbosch. He was impressed by the Dutch fortifications and on his return home had the garden at Charborough \\"cut into redoubts and works\\" as he had seen. He also employed a Dutchman to make a decoy pool for duck shooting. Estate wall and entrances Charborough Park is surrounded by one of the longest brick walls in England,www.waymarking.com comprising more than 2 million bricks and built between 1841 and 1842 by the then owner of the park John Samuel Wanley Sawbridge-Erle-Drax. He succeeded in having the new Wimborne/Dorchester turnpike moved further away from his house, a detour of over half a mile, but unfortunately for Sawbridge-Erle-Drax — who was also its chief promoter and investor — the turnpike lost money, mainly because the railway between Wimborne and Dorchester opened shortly afterwards. The park wall runs alongside the A31 and is punctuated by Stag Gate at the northern extremity and Lion Lodge at the easternmost entrance, with heraldic symbols in Lithodipyra (Coade stone) created by Eleanor Coade's Artificial Stone Manufactory.www.british-history.ac.uk These gateways are Grade II listed, as is a third one, East Almer Lodge, further to the west.

The meeting was effectively the start of the build-up to the Invitation to William, Prince of Orange, signed by the Immortal Seven, which resulted in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 which overthrew King James II in favour of the Dutch stadtholder Prince William III of Orange-Nassau, subsequently King William III of England.

It forms loose flocks in sparsely vegetated gibber plain and claypans in the day where it loafs in the shade and eats shoots of shrubs. It is most often encountered at night when it forages on roads for insects. The relative remoteness of its habitat means that it is not well studied. The most detailed observations of the species were made by the South African arid- zone ornithology specialist Gordon Maclean in the 1970s. Alternate English names include Australian plover, inland plover, desert plover and prairie plover. Description The inland dotterel is a medium-sized plover with a distinctive cryptic plumage. Males and females are similarly sized: in length, a wingspan of a weight of , and a short bill . It is unlikely to be confused with any other species when found in its normal habitat. Its upperparts are a rich sandy buff, mottled with dark brown. The black band across the crown extending down through the eye is unique. The face, ear coverts and neck are white, as is the vent. A broad black Y shaped band extends from the hindneck down the sides of the neck across the breast to the centre of the belly. Below the band the breast, flanks and belly are sandy buff. The legs are a pale buff colour, with the feet noticeably darker. The eye is dark brown. It has a short dark bill. Males and females have similar plumage. Maclean observed that the birds moulted into a paler, less bold non-breading plumage. Immature birds lack the distinct black markings on the head, neck and breast of the adults. It calls infrequently, most often a short quiet quick or guttural kroot or krrr when taking flight. The precocial young have short dense downy feathers, pinkish-buff or cream on the upperparts with a heavy pattern of dark brown blotches. The underparts are off white. The bill and legs are pale yellow.  Taxonomy and systematics  The inland dotterel was first documented in 1840 after Captain Charles Sturt collected an immature bird on one of his expeditions to the Australian interior and sent it to John Gould. Gould initially named it Eudromias australis (from the Greek eu, good, and dromos, runner, and australis, of the southern continent). The inland dotterel is one of over 60 shorebird species in the family Charadriidae, although it is rarely seen near water. Its taxonomic position continues to cause debate. The initial scientific name Eudromias australis supposed a generic relationship to the Eurasian dotterel (E. morinellus) that does not exist. Some modern authors place it in Charadrius, most closely related to the oriental plover (C. veredus) on mtDNA and protein allozyme evidence. Most authorities currently recognize the monotypic genera Peltohyas for the inland dotterel. Baker supported Peltohyas and placed the inland dotterel in a clade with other Australasian endemic genera (which also coincidentally consist a single species) the red-kneed dotterel (Erythrogons cinctus) and the wrybill (Anaryhnchus frontalis) of New Zealand. The Australian ornithologist Gregory M. Mathews proposed the subspecies C. australis whitlocki for birds in western Australia based on supposedly darker plumage, but the validity of this has been disputed. Distribution The inland dotterel occurs widely in the arid south-east and south-west of Australia. Its distribution corresponds to areas below the 100mm summer rainfall isohyet. It can be found in suitable habitat within this range in all the mainland states. Habitat Gibber plains, Sturt National Park Inland dotterels prefer sparsely vegetated habitat with low cover of saltbush, bluebush or samphire to provide food and shelter. It is most often seen in gibber plains, clay pans and gravel flats. It is believed to have benefited from land clearance for agriculture after European settlement. Movements are not well known – there appear to be seasonal movements south in the spring and north in the summer and there seems to be some movement beyond its normal range when excessive rains or severe drought makes habitat unsuitable. Vagrant birds have been observed as far as Sydney, NSW.  Behaviour and ecology  Typically in the day the birds associate in loose flocks of 10-20 birds, occasionally hundreds of birds. They are generally inactive in daytime, although they will forage on plants. At dusk the flock disperses and night sees most activity with individual birds hunting a variety of insect prey. It is during this activity that they are often encountered on outback roads. They tolerate high temperatures but will seek cover if the temperature exceeds 40 C (104 F). When approached they prefer to run away rather than fly. =Food= During the day the fleshy tips of desert shrubs are eaten. Inland dotterel have supraorbital salt glands, and it is thought these glands enable them to remove the salt content of the plants and hence use herbivory to source water. They have occasionally been observed drinking with large flocks gathering at stock tanks and clay-pans. At night the diet is insectivorous and spiders, grasshoppers, beetles, ants and earwigs have been recorded in gut contents.Captive bird photographed at Healesville Sanctuary, Victoria, Australia =Breeding= Inland dotterels form monogamous pairs when breeding, and both birds care for the young. May breed solitarily or in small colonies of up to six nests. Believed to breed at any time of the year if conditions are suitable, but generally breeding not well known, much data restricted to captive pairs. The nest is a shallow depression in bare ground, formed by the birds or taking advantage of a suitable natural depression. A clutch of three eggs is laid. The eggs are oval medium brown coloured with an irregular pattern of dark brown blotches, 3.7 cm x 2.7 cm. = Threats = In the inland dotterel's sparse desert habitat there are few significant threats. Foxes (Vulpes vulpes) have been observed predating eggs and young. Black falcon (Falco subniger) and nankeen kestrel (Falco cenchroides) have been observed attacking adults. = Parasites = Two parasitic lice have been recorded on inland dotterel, Austromenopon sp. and Quadraceps neoaustralis. Conservation While there are no reliable estimates, it is believed the across its range the population is relatively large and stable. The conservation classification at the IUCN is least concern. It is not listed in any Australian Federal or State acts, but is listed as vulnerable on the Victorian governments advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna.

The programme was most recently presented by Louisa Bojesen, but has been on hiatus since January 2009. Format For many years, prior to March 2007, the format of the programme remained constant. The first half of the show consisted solely of a segment called Halftime Report, presented from the CNBC Europe video wall. This detailed the major trades from each of the major European bourses (the London Stock Exchange, Euronext Paris, and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange), as well as several of the minor exchanges, commodity and bond trading, and United States futures exchanges. The second half, presented from the desk, consisted of a number of interviews. The programme was given a major revamp on 26 March 2007, in line with significant schedule changes at the network. The programme titles were re-coloured and a new theme tune was introduced. The Investor's Clinic segment of the programme, where viewers' questions are put to a panel of guests, has been increased in frequency to twice-weekly, and the Halftime Report now fills only the final fifteen minutes of the programme, focusing on just the equity markets. Other new segments introduced at this time include Research Notes, a daily look at changes in analyst ratings, and an update on the top stories in the United States from Worldwide Exchange anchor Michelle Caruso-Cabrera (later replaced by Brian Shactman). The programme is regularly extended to two hours on days of European Central Bank and Bank of England interest rate announcements (and on those occasions, pre-empts the second hour of US Squawk Box), and also on US holidays (when Squawk Box is not aired). Hiatus On 15 December 2008 CNBC Europe announced that the programme was to be replaced in the United Kingdom (and for those viewers in the Republic of Ireland who also receive the UK feed) by Strictly Money, a new programme focussing on UK specific issues. Strictly Money will air for an initial 12-week period from 12 January 2009. In the rest of Europe, Squawk Box will air in its entirety for the interim. Strictly Money has continued to air past this twelve-week period, and any return of Power Lunch has not been indicated. Strictly Money, which is presented by Ross Westgate (who is also the Europe anchor of Worldwide Exchange), soon became a permanent fixture on the CNBC Europe schedule and many of the segments that used to appear on Power Lunch Europe have moved over to Strictly Money.

SWERN formed a contractual relationship with Janet to operate the regional network that connects sites to the Janet backbone. SWERN was owned and operated by its member institutions. From the Board of Directors to the User Group all members of SWERN were taken from the institutions and institutions connecting to it. SWERN also covered Cheltenham which is home two higher education agencies; UCAS, the university admissions service, and HESA, the university statistics service. SWERN (as a network) ceased operating in December 2012. SWERN (as a company) was formally dissolved on 2 December 2014.

The burgh hall, which was briefly the headquarters of Pollokshields Burgh Council, is a Category A listed building. History The building was commissioned and endowed for future maintenance by the politician, Sir John Stirling Maxwell of Pollok House, as a gift for the people of Pollokshields. The site he selected in Glencairn Drive had formed part of the Old Pollok Estate, which had been home to the Maxwell family for over 700 years. The burgh hall was designed by Henry Edward Clifford in the Scottish Baronial style and built with dark red sandstone from the Ballochmyle Estate in Ayrshire. A ceremony was held at which Maxwell laid a memorial stone to commemorate the opening of the burgh hall and also the opening of Maxwell Park, which he had also gifted to the local people, on 25 October 1890. The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage facing Glencairn Drive; the main hall, which projected forward was on the left; the right bay featured a gabled porch with a round-headed doorway on the ground floor and a tower above; there was a bartizan on the right hand corner of the tower. The building was initially used as a masonic meeting place by masonic lodge no. 772 and was also briefly used as the headquarters of the independent burgh of Pollokshields until 1891 when the burgh was absorbed into the city of Glasgow in 1891. It was extended in 1935. After functioning as a day centre for Glasgow Corporation and then, from 1975, for Strathclyde Regional Council, it was deemed surplus to requirements in 1982 and acquired the Pollokshields Burgh Hall Trust for a nominal sum in 1986. Following refurbishment by the trust it reopened for community use in 1997. The lower ground floor was refurbished and converted for conference use with financial support from the National Heritage Memorial Fund in the late 1990s. The actress, Keira Knightley, attended her brother's wedding at the hall in April 2011. Architecture The dominant external feature of the building is the high tower while the entrance porch exhibits the Maxwell family coat of arms flanked by two Scottish lions.

The precinct is housed in a former waste depot and incinerator complex. It is located in Freemans Bay and its name derives from the adjacent Victoria Park which was created in 1905 and named after the late Queen who had died four years earlier. Until April 2016 the precinct was a craft, souvenir and clothing market and retail complex. It underwent a $22M refurbishment allowing for the earthquake proofing of the historic buildings and the introduction of some new buildings. The weekend Pop Up Markets recommenced in June 2017 after the refurbishment works were completed. There is a popular Celebrity Walk of Fame; this opened in 1984, and features the hand or footprints of famous New Zealanders including Sir Edmund Hillary, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, Billy T James, John Walker and Rachel Hunter. Site history The site of the Victoria Park Market buildings was originally part headland and part foreshore of Freemans Bay. In the late 1870s the bay began to be reclaimed, and various commercial and residential buildings were erected on the widened foreshore. The street directly behind and above the market runs along the top of the ancient sea cliff. From 1905 to 1918 a series of brickwork buildings was constructed on the site, initially to deal with the disposal of rubbish from the city. These included a 38m tall chimney. In 1907 work began on a power generator building to use the heat produced by the \\"Destructor\\". Although this was finished in 1908, it was found to be inadequate for the city's power demands, and was shut down in 1913 after a new coal fired power station was constructed on the city's waterfront at Kings Wharf. Further additions were made from 1914 to 1918, including double storeyed stabling for the 94 horses used to pull the city's rubbish carts, and council administration offices. From 1952 the stables were no longer used for their original purpose, and the 'Destructor' ceased operation in 1972, although the complex continued to act as a rubbish collection depot until 1981. The Auckland City Council originally planned to demolish the complex, but relented following a public campaign. It was converted into a market and retail complex, and alterations were made for this purpose in 1983 and 1990. The complex is a Category I Historic Places under the Historic Places Act 1993.

Web. 11 Nov. 2010. <>. Life and career Mohamed Ibrahim Habsade was born in Toosweyne village in the Berdale district of Bay region. He served in the military of Siad Barre and was located in the northern part of Somalia, mainly in Hargeisa and Buro. He follows the Sufi sect of Islam, particularly Sheikh Banani Tariqah. He was among the leaders who laid the foundations of Rahanweyn Resistance Army (RRA), established in Jafay in the outskirts of Berdale district late 1995. He died on January 24, 2015. =Background of conflict= Prior to Aideed's invasion of Baidoa on 17 September 1995, the Leysan sub-clan of the Rahanweyn clan were almost all the employees of the UNOSOM and the relief Service Organisation. The Al- Ahli Company, run by Sharif Hassan Sheikh Adan whose mother is from Leysan, had monopoly power in signing contract with the Relief Service Organisation whıch were stationed in Baidoa to offer aid to the victims of the famine which hit the area between Juba and Shabelle. This made the other Rahanwien subclans feel marginalised and prompted frequent clashes between the Leysan and the Harin, the Jiron, and eventually the Eelay in September 1995. The Leysan captured the Elaay inhabited town of Buurhakaba. The Eelay elders resorted to Mohamed Farah Aideed and asked him to attack Baidoa. As a result of this Baidoa fell in the hands of Aideed on a Sunday morning on 17 September 1995. Most of the Rahanwein clans initially welcomed Aideed The Elaay sided with Aideed. The ousted leaders of the Leysan including Habsade resorted to armed resistance to free Baidoa from Aideed, and together with other Rahanwein politicians founded RRA in Jaffay and appointed by colonel Hassan Mohamed Nor Shaatigaduud. =Opposition= Habsade elected the thirty leader of RRA,. According to Habsade, his subclan, Leysan, and other clans which was the target of Aideed's invasion of Baidoa. Therefore, they viewed that without the help of Rahanwein subclans, they will not achieve their goals of liberating . As well as Hasan Muhammad Nur Shatigadud of the Harin subclan elected to the leadership of RRA. This move won the support he expected from other subclans, but after the liberation of Baidoa in 1999, habsade his clan held him responsible for their third position of RRA leadership. In 2002, Habsade, along with Sheikh Aden Madobe, who is from the Hadame clan, opposed Shatigudud when he declared himself the president of the short-lived semi-autonomous government of Shouthwestern. Habsade and Sheikh Aden Madowe then clashed a few years later, ensuing several fights within Baidoa city. Habsade's fighters, getting help from an ally named Mohamed Nur Saraonsor, another Hadame clan member, eventually ousted the militias loyal to both Sheikh Aden Madowe and Shatigadud. Habsade opposed the relocation of the TFG to Baidoa and eventually allied himself with the Mogadishu warlords.

It is sited above the town of Whaley Bridge in the Derbyshire High Peak area of England. The reservoir is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) providing habitats for herons, ducks and other animals and fish, while rare mosses and liverworts grow on its shores, particularly short-lived species that grow on seasonally exposed mud. The reservoir is used for sailingToddbrook Sailing Club accessed 16 May 2008 and angling. The Peak District Boundary Walk runs around the eastern end of the reservoir. The reservoir is owned by the Canal & River Trust and, like the nearby Combs Reservoir, is a feeder reservoir for the Peak Forest Canal. The feeder runs through Whaley Bridge, and with the Combs feed enters the canal system in a pool close to the transhipment shed at the Whaley Bridge canal basin. The reservoir is fed from the Todd Brook, a stream which has a catchment area of around including the moorland on Shining Tor and farmland around Kettleshulme village. Water enters the reservoir on its north bank via a small waterfall. The first several inches of water do not flow into the reservoir but flow down the reservoir's run-off into the River Goyt. The reservoir often receives little or no inflow during periods when rainfall does not allow the level to exceed the barrier, and this often affects the reservoir's water level, particularly in the summer months. The reservoir's dam is built from earth with a puddle clay core. The embankment is straight in plan and approximately 310m long. The average crest level is AOD. In August 2019, concrete panels on its spillway were dislodged after heavy rain, triggering the evacuation of parts of Whaley Bridge and the surrounding area due to the possibility of the dam collapsing. Dam works Growth of traffic on the Peak Forest Canal meant that the water supply from Combs Reservoir proved insufficient, despite the trustees of the Macclesfield Canal allowing the transfer of water from the summit level of their Sutton Reservoir. The General Assembly of the Peak Forest Canal company approved the adoption of the site of Toddbrook Reservoir in June 1834 on the advice of Samuel Taylor, a land surveyor (a further proposed reservoir on the Hockham Brook above Chapel Milton was never completed). Negotiations for the sale of the land began in June 1834 but were not concluded until 1839. Work did not go smoothly: from the start, concerns were expressed over the geology of the site and the known existence of coal workings below the valley, and various sites were considered for the dam. John Wood drew up the first plans, though these were amended on the advice of various consultant engineers, including Robert Matthews (engineer of the Rochdale Canal) and Nicholas Brown, who had experience of building reservoirs. Contracts for the reservoir construction were awarded to William Collinge and Richard and William Walker in August 1836. Geological problems continued to dog the project, and the site of the dam was altered on the advice of William Mackenzie in 1837. As a stopgap, waters from the Todd Brook were diverted around the reservoir site and into the canal, and this solution proved so effective that consideration was even given to abandoning the reservoir project. Ultimately, however, construction continued using new plans supervised by Mackenzie and the reservoir's completion was reported in the canal committee's annual report of June 1841. The dam was at the time the tallest ever built for a canal reservoir. Consultant engineer Nicholas Brown's report of 1836 had specified a puddle trench varying from 12 feet at the brook end to 6 feet in width, but investigations in the late 20th century led to doubt as to whether it was constructed as laid out on original drawings or with more porous core material. The peak of the dam wall is supported either side by embankments with a slope of 1:2. Underneath the dam, the geology includes glacial sands and gravel, glacial till overlying mudstones, sandstones, shales and coal measures. It was known that local coal mining had been a threat to the dam's integrity for many years, with complaints dating from 1880 that water was leaking into coal mines. After the Whaley Bridge Colliery proposed to work coal below the site, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, who owned the canal at the time, purchased coal measures beneath the reservoir site for £8,550 after evidence of subsidence came to light. Leakage was observed from the foot of the dam and investigated in 1931. The leak coincided with a hollow in the upstream slope of the dam which was filled in. In November 1975, low water revealed that another hollow had formed in the same area which led to regular monitoring of the dam. In 1977 it was noted that there had been of subsidence since 1975. The reservoir was drained and a four metre wide hole was discovered, partly filled by silt and a tree which appeared to have been drawn in by the flow of water into the hole. Between 1978 and 1980, further investigations included drilling bore holes into the affected areas. In 1981 a diameter masonry culvert was discovered which had probably been built into the dam wall at the time of its construction to divert ground water, which can undermine a dam from below. Leaks had developed around it, as had happened to other dams where pipework or drainage had been built through a clay dam wall creating a weak spot. Repairs were made and a layer of waterproof clay was laid over the weak spot on the upstream face of the dam. The clay core was reinforced by injecting grout along a 60 metre length and the reservoir was refilled in December 1983. The 1969 dam wall spillway in 2005. Note channel for original spillway in foreground. In December 1964, high rainfall resulted in damage to the dam’s spillway. The water level rose to one metre above the overflow spillway at the side of the reservoir and remained high for 24 hours but did not rise above the main dam wall and the spillway prevented the water flowing over it and washing the earth embankment away. However, the high volume of water damaged the lower part of the spillway channel and escaping water started to erode the right bank at the base of the dam. The damage was repaired in 1965 but flood studies judged the spillway to be inadequate. It was noted by the Environment Agency that damage had occurred to nine other dams of similar design where the spillway delivered water to the foot of the dam. In 1969 an additional concrete spillway was built on the downstream face of the dam along a length of . This new weir was formed by adding concrete capping to the earth embankment to protect it from flowing water and was set above the existing spillway so that excess water would initially overflow along the original path. In the 1980s, British Waterways carried out significant repair works to deal with leaks involving the mine shafts around the dam and a culvert was constructed under the current beach/launching area of the reservoir. A stone marker on the main beach showed its location for many years, but was relocated to the footpath opposite Toddbrook Lodge during access work for the 2009 draining. The reservoir was partially drained again in 2009 for inspection before being fully drained for repairs in 2010. The £500,000 project entailed fish stocks being moved to other locations before repairing pitching to the wall of the dam. Other work involved repairs to the 100-year-old pipework used to feed water stored in the reservoir at a controlled rate into the Peak Forest Canal and included; clearing silt and debris from pipework inlets, removing old valves and connections to pipework, cleaning, inspecting and repairing old pipework, re-lining old pipework with a resin “sock” liner cured under pressure using ultraviolet lights, replacement of valves, testing of the new system and replacement of screens to intakes. 2019 incident A view looking down the spillway in 2014 before the concrete slabs to the left of the picture were damaged in 2019 On 1 August 2019, a major incident was declared and 1,500 residents were evacuated from parts of Whaley Bridge, Furness Vale and New Mills after concrete slabs on the 1969 overflow spillway were partially dislodged by high volumes of water following several days of heavy rain. The Environment Agency issued a 'danger to life' warning due to the possibility of the dam collapsing. High-volume pumps were deployed to take water from the reservoir to prevent it from overflowing and reduce pressure on the dam. An RAF Chinook helicopter dropped 400 tonnes of aggregate into the damaged area and specialist contractors added concrete grouting between the bags of ballast to bind them together to support the spillway. On 6 August the Canal & River Trust confirmed that the target reduction in water level of had been achieved and that the reservoir was down to 25% of its capacity, which would allow a full inspection of the damage to the structure to be made. Fifty residents were allowed to return to their homes on the evening of 6 August and, following a final safety inspection on 7 August, Derbyshire Constabulary declared that it was safe for the rest of the residents to return also. It was reported on 7 August that a representative of the Canal & River Trust had told residents, at a meeting on 6 August, that the whole of the reservoir, including the dam, would be completely reconstructed, in a project that would span a number of years. In September 2019 the then Secretary of State, Theresa Villiers, commissioned a review of the incident. She appointed Professor David Balmforth to study the cause, prevention, prediction and lessons to be learnt. Professor Balmforth made 22 recommendations, which the government accepted. Balmforth was also commissioned to lead a second-stage review, with a wider remit of reservoir safety legislation and implementation. In parallel with Balmforth's review, the owners and maintainers of the dam, the Canal & River Trust, commissioned Dr Andrew Hughes to seek the reasons for the incident. His 77-page report stated that \\"there were indications, that an experienced reservoir engineer should have identified, of the flaws in the design and the potential for a problem to exist and develop.\\" Notes References * Category:Dams in England Category:Reservoirs of the Peak District Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Derbyshire Category:Reservoirs in Derbyshire Category:Canal reservoirs in England ","title":"Toddbrook Reservoir"},{"id":"9481410","text":"This list of castles in Africa includes castles, forts, and mock castles in Africa.

The relations between the Russian Empire and the United States of America (1776–1922) predate the Soviet Union–United States relations (1922–1991) and the Russia–United States relations (1991–present). Relations between the two countries were established in 1776. Russian involvement in the American Revolutionary War The relations between the two states are usually considered to have begun in 1776, when the United States of America declared its independence from the British Empire and became an independent state. Earlier contacts had occurred. In 1763 a Boston merchant had anchored his ship at the port of Kronstadt after a direct transatlantic voyage. Despite being geographically removed from the American scene, Russia under Catherine the Great significantly affected the American Revolution through diplomacy. While Catherine personally oversaw most of Russia's interactions with the new nation, she also entrusted certain tasks to her foreign advisor Nikita Ivanovich Panin, who often acted on Catherine's behalf when it came to matters of international diplomacy. Catherine and Panin interacted with the British government through James Harris, 1st Earl of Malmesbury at the Russian court.Frank A. Golder, \\"Catherine II and the American Revolution,\\" The American Historical Review 21.1 (1915): 92–96. The decisions made by Catherine and Panin during the Revolution to remain officially neutral, refuse Britain's requests for military assistance, and insist on peace talks that linked a resolution of the American Revolution with the settlement of separate European conflicts indirectly helped the Americans win the Revolution and gain independence.Hans Rogger, \\"The influence of the American Revolution in Russia.\\" in Jack P. Greene and J. R. Pole, eds. A Companion to the American Revolution (2000): 554-555. =Trade with the Americans= Small scale direct trade between Russia and the colonies began as early as 1763. Such trade was a violation of Britain's Navigation Acts, which only allowed the colonies to trade with Britain. Russian products such as hemp, sail linen and iron started arriving in colonial ports years before the Revolutionary War began and did not stop once the war started.Nikolai Bolkhovitinov, Russia and the American Revolution (Tallahassee: Diplomatic, 1976): 76. The Americans and Russia saw each other as trading partners. Throughout the Revolutionary War, Catherine believed an independent American nation would be ideal for Russian business interests. While some Russian leaders worried that an independent America might interfere with Russia's trade with other European nations, Catherine saw direct Russo-American trade as an excellent opportunity to expand commerce. Catherine knew that after the Revolution, a free America could trade directly with Russia without interference. Moreover, if the Americans gained their freedom, Britain would have to turn to other countries - such as Russia - to supply it with the resources it could no longer simply extract from America.Bolkhovitinov, Russia and the American Revolution, 80–84. =Neutrality= Catherine chose to have Russia remain officially neutral during the Revolution, never openly picking sides in the war.Golder, \\"Catherine II and the American Revolution,\\" 92. On an unofficial basis, however, she acted favorably towards the American colonists, by offering to provide them anything she could without compromising Russia's neutrality and her eventual desire to act as a mediator. In March 1780, the Russian ministry released a \\"Declaration of Armed Neutrality.\\" This declaration set out Russia's international stance on the American Revolution, focusing mainly on the importance of allowing neutral vessels to travel freely to any Russian port without being searched or harassed by the Navigation Acts. While the declaration kept Russia officially neutral, it supported many of France's own pro-colonial policies and resisted Britain's efforts to strangle America through a naval blockade. The declaration also gave the American rebels an emotional lift, as they realized Russia was not solidly aligned with Britain.Norman Saul, Distant Friends: the United States and Russia, 1763–1867 (Lawrence: University of Kansas, 1991): 12. With Russia as a potential, powerful friend, Russo-American connections and communications continued to improve. Nevertheless, Catherine refused to openly recognize the United States as an independent nation until the war ended.Golder, \\"Catherine II and the American Revolution,\\" 92. =Britain's requests for assistance= As the Revolutionary War continued into the late 1770s, a growing list of European powers took sides against Britain. The British Ministry saw the need to solidify an alliance with Russia to bolster its American war. As a world power that had allied with Britain in the past, the Russians were an obvious choice to assist Britain with logistical and military support, as well as diplomatic efforts.Golder, \\"Catherine II and the American Revolution,\\" 93. While Catherine seems to have admired the British people and their culture, she disliked Britain's King George and his ministry. She was particularly disturbed by the Seven Years' War, during which Catherine observed Britain's efforts to discreetly exit the conflict and leave Russia's Prussian allies vulnerable to defeat. She considered these efforts immoral and disloyal, and saw Britain as an unreliable ally. She also viewed the American Revolution as Britain's fault. Citing the constant change in Britain's ministries as a major reason, Catherine understood the American grievances.Lawrence Kaplan, The American Revolution and \\"a Candid World\\" (Kent: Kent State UP, 1977): 91. Despite Russia's official neutrality, Catherine's negative opinions of British rule and her view that Britain caused the revolution weighed on her decisions when Britain began to request Russian support. In the summer of 1775, Britain sent diplomats to Russia in an attempt to learn whether Catherine would agree to send troops to America to aid British forces. Although her initial response seemed positive, Catherine denied King George's formal request for support. While her dislike of the British ministry likely influenced her decision, Catherine formally cited the fact that her army needed rest after having just finished more than six years of war.Saul, Distant Friends: the United States and Russia, 7. In November 1779, Britain made another plea for Russian assistance. Swallowing their pride, the British ministry acknowledged to Catherine the collective power of Britain's enemies, as well as the King's desire for peace. The British ministry's letter to Catherine explained these concerns and offered to \\"commit her Britain's interests to the hand of the Empress.\\"Golder, \\"Catherine II and the American Revolution,\\" 94. The British included a specific request that Russia use force against all British enemies, including other European countries, to stop the American Revolution. After waiting several months, Catherine decided to refuse Britain's request.Golder, \\"Catherine II and the American Revolution,\\" 94. In 1781, Britain attempted to bribe Russia to gain its assistance. Distressed and realizing that they were close to losing the war, James Harris asked if a piece of British territory could convince Russia to join the fight on the side of England. Offering the island of Minorca, Harris did not request soldiers in exchange; this time Britain simply asked that Russia convince France to exit the war and force the American rebels to fight alone. Perhaps revealing her secret desire to have the Americans gain their independence, Catherine used Harris' proposal to embarrass Britain. She declined Harris' offer and published Britain's attempts at bribery to the French and Spanish.Golder, \\"Catherine II and the American Revolution,\\" 95. =Attempt at peace-making= Catherine played a significant role in peacemaking efforts during the Revolutionary War. In October 1780, she sent a proposal to each of the European powers involved in the conflict. The proposal requested that the countries meet to discuss what could be done to create peace. The powers met in Vienna after Britain requested the Austrian ministry co-mediate the peace talks. Catherine sent Prince Dimitri Galitzin to act on her behalf as the Russian mediator. She sent him with a proposed set of peace guidelines that included a multi-year armistice between the countries and a requirement that there be negotiations between Britain and their European enemies as well as between Britain and America. Catherine chose not to include a proposal concerning whether America would become autonomous. Since the British would not accept American independence and the French would not accept anything short of it, Catherine realized that explicitly providing for either outcome would lead to an immediate breakdown in the talks.Bolkhovitinov, Russia and the American Revolution, 50–52. Catherine's ambiguous negotiation efforts ultimately fell through. 19th century In 1801 Thomas Jefferson appointed Levett Harris as the first American consul- general to Russia (1803-1816). The Monroe Doctrine was partly aimed at Holy Alliance support of intervention in Latin America which Russia several times tried to get the United States to join, as well as the Ukase of 1821 banning non-Russian ships from the Northwest Coast. The Russo-American Treaty of 1824 set parallel 54°40′ north as the boundary between Russian America and the Anglo-American Oregon Country. =American Civil War= During the winter of 1861–1862, the Imperial Russian Navy sent two fleets to American waters to avoid their getting trapped if a war broke out with Britain and France. Many Americans at the time viewed this as an intervention on behalf of the Union, though some historians question this.Thomas A. Bailey, \\"The Russian Fleet Myth Re-Examined,\\" Mississippi Valley Historical Review, Vol. 38, No. 1 (Jun., 1951), pp. 81–90 in JSTOR The Alexander Nevsky and the other vessels of the Atlantic squadron stayed in American waters for seven months (September 1863 to June 1864). 1865 saw a major project attempted: the building of a Russian- American telegraph line from Seattle, through British Columbia, Russian America (Alaska) and Siberia—an early attempt to link East-West communications. It failed and never operated.Rosemary Neering, Continental Dash: The Russian-American Telegraph (1989) =Alaska purchase, 1867= Russia operated a small fur-trade operations in Alaska, coupled with missionaries to the natives. By 1861 the project lost money, threatened to antagonize the Americans, and could not be defended from Britain. It proved practically impossible to entice Russians to permanently migrate to Alaska; only a few hundred were there in 1867. In the Alaska Purchase of 1867 it was sold to the United States for $7.2 million dollars.James R. Gibson, \\"Why the Russians Sold Alaska.\\" Wilson Quarterly 3.3 (1979): 179-188 online.Thomas A. Bailey, \\"Why the United States Purchased Alaska.\\" Pacific Historical Review 3.1 (1934): 39-49. online All the Russian administrators and military left Alaska but some missionaries stayed on to minister to the many natives they had converted to the Russian Orthodox faith.Ronald Jensen, The Alaska Purchase and Russian- American Relations (1975) 1880–1918 Herman S. Shapiro. \\"Kishinever shekhita, elegie\\" [Kishinev Massacre Elegy]. Sheet music cover, New York: 1904. From 1880 to 1917, about 3.2 million immigrants arrived in the U.S. from the Russian Empire. Most were Jews or Poles; only 100,000 were ethnic Russians. Meanwhile large numbers of minorities-– especially Jews, Poles, and Lithuanians emigrated to the United States before 1914. Few ethnic Russians emigrated. Relations remained cool, especially because of the repeated pogroms, although there was no antagonism against Russia among American public due to close relations between two governments. =Pogroms massacre Jews= After 1880, repeated anti-Jewish pogroms in Russia alienated American elite and public opinion. In 1903 the Kishinev pogrom killed 47 Jews, injured 400, and left 10,000 homeless and dependent on relief. American Jews began large- scale organized financial help, and assisted in emigration.Philip Ernest Schoenberg, \\"The American Reaction to the Kishinev Pogrom of 1903.\\" American Jewish Historical Quarterly 63.3 (1974): 262-283.

Knee, \\"The Diplomacy of Neutrality: Theodore Roosevelt and the Russian Pogroms of 1903-1906.\\" Presidential Studies Quarterly 19#1 (1989): 71-78. =Boxer rebellion= In 1900, Russia and America were part of the Eight-Nation Alliance suppressing the Boxer Rebellion in China. Russia soon afterward occupied Manchuria at this time, and the US asserted the Open Door Policy to forestall Russian and German territorial demands from leading to a partition of China into various colonies. =Wars= President Theodore Roosevelt played a major role in ending the Russo-Japanese War. During the war, Roosevelt tacitly supported Japan. The Treaty of Portsmouth was signed in 1905, marking a humiliating defeat for the Russians. Roosevelt received the Nobel Peace Prize. In World War I the United States declaration of war on Germany (1917) came after the Czar was overthrown in the February Revolution. When the Czar was still in power, many Americans deplored fighting a war with him as an ally. With him gone, the Woodrow Wilson administration United States used this new provisional government to describe how the new democratic nations are fighting against autocratic old empires of Germany and Austria-Hungary. During the war, the American Expeditionary Forces were just starting to see battle when the October Revolution removed Russia from the war. Before Germany surrendered in November 1918, the US participated in Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War with the Polar Bear Expedition and the American Expeditionary Force Siberia. the American goal was to prevent the German enemy from gaining access to war supplies controlled by the Bolsheviks. When the British tried to use American forces to stop the spread of Bolshevism, President Wilson removed them .John W.

(In official documents, the Western surname may be written before the given name or names.) Italian names, with their fixed nome + cognome structure, have little to do with the ancient Roman naming conventions, which used a tripartite system of given name + gentile name + hereditary or personal name (or names). The Italian nome is not analogous to the ancient Roman nomen: the former \\"is\\" the given name (distinct between siblings), while the latter the gentile name (inherited, and thus shared, by all belonging to a gens). Female naming traditions, and name changing rules after adoption, for both sexes likewise differ between Roman antiquity and modern Italian use. Moreover, the low number, and the steady decline of importance and variety, of Roman praenomina starkly contrast with the current number of Italian given names.Oxford Classical Dictionary, 2nd Ed. (1970)Burgio, Dizionario dei nomi propri di persona In Italy, one portion in person's name may be determined by the name day, and is referred to as his or her \\"\\". These name days are determined according to the Sanctorale, a cycle found in the General Roman Calendar, which assigns to a day a saint (or as to the great majority of days, several saints), so that different names often are celebrated on that day. Traditionally, parents fix the name day of their child at christening, according to their favourite saint; in case of different ones (on different days) with the same name; that child will carry it throughout life. In the case of multiple given names, the child will celebrate only one, usually the first.

A few names end with an accented vowel, for instance Niccolò and Giosuè. Almost every base name can have a diminutive form ending with -ino/-ina or -etto/etta as in Paolino/Paoletto and Paolina/Paoletta from Paolo and Paola, -ello/-ella, as in Donatello/Donatella from Donato and Donata, or -uccio/-uccia, as in Guiduccio from Guido. The forms -uzzo/-uzza, as in Santuzza from Santa, are typical of Sicilian language. The most common names are: * For males: Marco, Alessandro, Giuseppe, Flavio, Luca, Giovanni, Roberto, Andrea, Stefano, Angelo, Francesco, Mario, Luigi. * For females: Anna, Maria, Sara, Laura, Aurora, Valentina, Giulia, Rosa, Gianna, Giuseppina, Angela, Giovanna, Sofia, Stella. Since the ancient Romans had a very limited stock of given names (praenomina), very few modern Italian given names (nomi) are derived directly from the classical ones. A rare example would be Marco (from Marcus). Some nomi were taken from classical clan names (nomina)—for their meanings or because they are euphonic, such as Emilio/Emilia (from Aemilius), Valerio/Valeria (from Valerius), Claudio/Claudia (from Claudius), Orazio (from Horatius), Fabio (from the cognomen Fabius), Flavio/Flavia (from Flavius) and Fulvio from Fulvius. When combined with a second given name, Giovanni and Pietro are commonly contracted to Gian- and Pier-, as in Giancarlo, Gianfranco, Gianluca, Gianluigi, Gianmaria, Giampaolo (Gianpaolo), Giampiero (Gianpiero), Giambattista, Pierangelo, Pierantonio, Pierfranco, Pierluigi, Piermaria, Pierpaolo, and so on. Italian unisex names are very rare (e.g. Celeste), but the feminine name Maria is common as a masculine second name, as in Gianmaria, Carlo Maria, Anton Maria etc. Surnames Italy has the largest collection of surnames (cognomi) of any country in the world, with over 350,000.Il Corriere della Sera (Sept 15, 2006), L'Italia è il regno dei cognomi and La provenienza geografica dei cognomi Men—except slaves—in ancient Rome always had hereditary surnames, i.e., nomen (clan name) and cognomen (side-clan name). However, the multi-name tradition was lost by the Middle Ages. Outside the aristocracy, where surnames were often patronymic or those of manors or fiefs, most Italians began to assume hereditary surnames around 1450. Registration of baptisms and marriages became mandatory in parishes after the Council of Trento in 1564.Italy World Club, Italian Surnames: Etymology and Origin =Suffixes= A large number of Italian surnames end in i, due to the medieval Italian habit of identifying families by the name of the ancestors in the plural (which have an -i suffix in Italian). For instance, Filippo from the Ormanno family (gli Ormanni) would be called \\"signor Filippo degli Ormanni\\" (\\"Mr. Filippo of the Ormannos\\"). In time, the middle possessive portion (\\"of the\\") was dropped, but surnames became permanently pluralized and never referred to in the singular, even for a single person. Filippo Ormanno would therefore be known as Filippo Ormanni.Hall, Robert A. (1941), \\"Definite Article + Family Name in Italian\\". Language 17 (1): 33–39 Some families, however, opted to retain the possessive portion of their surnames, for instance Lorenzo de' Medici literally means \\"Lorenzo of the Medici\\" (de' is a contraction of dei, also meaning \\"of the\\"; c.f. The Medicis). Some common suffixes indicate endearment (which may also become pluralized and receive an -i ending), for example: * -ello/illo/etto/ino (diminutive \\"little\\"), e.g., Bernardello, Vettorello, Iannuccillo, Bortoletto, Bernardino, Ravellino, Verdino * -one/ne (augmentative \\"big\\"), e.g., Mangione, Bellone, Capone, Pastene, Mantone, Vallone * -accio/azzo/asso (pejorative), e.g., Boccaccio, Terrazzo, Varasso Other endings are characteristic of certain regions: *Veneto: -asso, -ato/ati, and consonants (l, n, r); -on: Bissacco, Zoccarato, Cavinato, Brombal, Bordin, Meneghin, Perin, Vazzoler, Peron, Francescon, Zanon, Fanton *Sicily: -aro, -isi and \\"osso\\": Cavallaro, Cherisi, Rosi, Rosso (Sicily, Piedmont and Veneto) *Lombardy and Piemont: -ago/ghi (of Celtic derivation), -engo/enghi (of Germanic derivation): Salmoiraghi, Ornaghi, Vernengo, Martinengo, Giordanengo, Lambertenghi *Lombardy: -ate/ati/atti: Lunati, Bonatti, Moratti, Orsatti *Piedmont: -ero, -audi, -asco,-zzi, -anti, -ini: Ferrero, Rambaudi, Comaco, Bonazzi, Santi, Baldovini *Friuli: -otti/utti and -t: Bortolotti, Pascutti, Codutti, Rigonat, Ret *Tuscany: -ai and -aci/ecci/ucci: Bollai, Balducci, Martaci *Sardinia: -u, -as and -is, derived from the Sardinian language: Pusceddu, Cadeddu, Schirru, Marras, Argiolas, Floris, Melis, Abis *Calabria: -ace: Storace, Versace *Campania: -iello: Borriello, Aiello, Manganiello *Abruzzo: -us, -is and -iis that stem from traditional Latin names: Fidelibus, De Sanctis, De Laurentiis =Origins= As in most other European naming traditions, patronymics are common. Originally they were indicated by a possessive, e.g., Francesco de Bernardo, meaning \\"Francis (the son) of Bernard\\". De Luca (\\"[son] of Luke\\") remains one of the most common Italian surnames. However, de (\\"of\\") was often dropped and suffixes added, hence de Bernardo evolved to be Bernardo and eventually pluralized as Bernardi (see Suffixes above). The origin or residence of the family gave rise to many surnames, e.g., * Habitat: Della Valle (\\"of the valley\\"), Montagna (\\"mountain\\"). * Specific placename: **Abbruzzesi/Abbruzzi/Abruzzi/Abruzzese/Abruzzesi/D'Abbruzzo/D'Abruzzo (\\"Abruzzan\\"/\\"of Abruzzo\\"/\\"from Abruzzo\\") **Benevento/Di Benevento/Beneventano (\\"Beneventan\\"/\\"from Benevento\\") **Albanese/Albanesi (\\"Albanian\\"/\\"from Albania\\") **Bologna/Bologni/Bolognese/Bolognesi (\\"Bolognan\\"/\\"from Bologna\\") **Bresci/(De) Brescia/Bresciani/Bresciano/Brescianini (\\"Brescian\\"/\\"from Brescia\\") **Calabrese/Calabresi/Calabria (\\"Calabrian\\"/\\"from Calabria\\") **Campaniano/Campano/Campana (\\"Campanian\\"/\\"from Campania\\") **Casertano (\\"Casertanian\\"/\\"from Caserta\\") **Catalani/Catalano (\\"Catalan\\"/\\"from Catalonia\\") **Catanese/Catanesi/Catania (\\"Catanian\\"/\\"from Catania\\"/\\"from the province of Catania\\") **Emiliani/Emiliano (\\"Emilian\\"/\\"from Emilia\\") **Fiorentini/Fiorentino/Firenze/Florenzi (\\"Florentine\\"/\\"from Florence\\") **Francese/Franzese/Franzesi (\\"French\\"/\\"from France\\") **De Genova/Di Genova/Genova/Genovese/Genovesi (\\"Genoan\\"/\\"from Genoa\\") **Greco (\\"Greek\\") **De Lucca/Di Lucca/Lucca/Lucchesi/Lucchese (\\"Luccan\\"/\\"from Lucca\\") **Maltese/Maltesi (\\"Maltese\\"/\\"from Malta\\") **De Milano/Di Milano/Milano/Milanese/Milanesi (\\"Milanese\\"/\\"from Milan\\") **De Napoli/Di Napoli/Napoli/Napoletani/Napoletano/Napolitani/Napolitano (\\"Neapolitan\\"/\\"from Naples\\") **Di Norcia/Norcia/\\"from Norcia\\") **Da Padova/Di Padova/Padova/Padovani/Padovano/Patavini/Patavino/Padovan (\\"Paduan\\"/\\"from Padua\\") **(Di) Palermo/Palermitani/Palermitano (\\"Palermitan\\"/\\"from Palermo\\") **De Pisa/Di Pisa/Pisa/Pisani/Pisano (\\"Pisan\\"/\\"from Pisa\\") **Portoghese/Portoghesi (\\"Portuguese\\"/\\"from Portugal\\") **Puglisi/Pugliese (\\"Apulian\\"/\\"from Apulia\\") **Romagnoli/Romagnolo (\\"Romagnan\\"/\\"from Romagna\\") **Romana/Romani/Romano (\\"Roman\\"/\\"from Rome\\") **Salerno/Salernitani/Salernitano (\\"Salernitan\\"/\\"from Salerno\\") **Sardo (\\"Sardinian\\"/\\"from Sardinia\\") **Siciliana/Siciliani/Siciliano (\\"Sicilian\\"/\\"from Sicily\\") **Spagnola/Spagnoli/Spagnolo/Spagnuola/Spagnuoli/Spagnuolo (\\"Spaniard\\", \\"Spanish\\", \\"from Spain\\") **Svizzera/Svizzeri/Svizzero (\\"Swiss\\"/\\"from Switzerland\\") **Tedeschi/Tedesco/Tedisco/Todeschi/Todesco (\\"German\\"/\\"from Germany\\") **Toscani/Toscano (\\"Tuscan\\"/\\"from Tuscany\\") **Trapanese/Trapanesi (\\"Trapanese\\"/\\"from Trapani\\"/\\"from the province of Trapani\\") **Umbro (\\"Umbrian\\"/\\"from Umbria\\") **Veneziani/Veneziano (\\"Venetian\\"/\\"from Venice\\") **Veronese/Veronesi (\\"from Verona\\") * Nearby landmarks: La Porta (\\"the gate\\"), Fontana (\\"fountain\\"), Torregrossa (\\"big tower\\"). Ancestors' occupation was also a great source of surnames. * Job title: Pastore (\\"shepherd\\"), Tagliabue (\\"ox-cutter\\"), Passafiume and Passalacqua (\\"waterman\\"). * Objects (metonyms) associated with the vocation: Zappa (\\"hoe\\", farmer), Delle Fave (\\"of the beans\\", grocer), Martelli (\\"hammers\\", carpenter), Tenaglia (\\"pincer\\", smith), Farina (\\"flour\\", baker), Garitta/Garita (\\"garitta di vedetta\\"), Forni (\\"ovens\\", cook), Ferraro (\\"blacksmith\\"). Nicknames, referring to physical attributes or mannerism, also gave rise to some family names, e.g., Rossi (from rosso \\"redhead\\"), Basso (\\"short\\"), Caporaso (\\"shaved or bald head\\"), Pappalardo (\\"lard-eater\\", originally an abusive nickname for one who professed himself a devout person but ate meat and fatty dishes in forbidden times), and Barbagelata (\\"frozen beard\\"). A few family names are still in the original Latin, like Santorum, De Juliis and De Laurentiis, reflecting that the family name has been preserved from Medieval Latin sources as a part of their business or household documentation or church records. Articles The traditional rule, which is the common usage especially in Tuscany, is that in referring to people by their surnames alone, the definite article should be used (il for most parts, lo before some consonants and consonant clusters and l before vowels). Mario Russo, therefore, is called il Russo (\\"the Russo\\"). Now, some prefer to use the article only or chiefly for historical surnames (\\"l'Ariosto\\", \\"il Manzoni\\", etc.) Male given names are never preceded by an article except in popular northern regional usage. However, in Tuscany and the rest of Northern Italy, given names of females are usually preceded by articles (la Maria, la Gianna) unless one is speaking of a woman who is personally unknown (such as Cleopatra, Maria Stuarda, with no article).Meyer- Lübke. Grammaire des langues romanes 3 §150. That is also the traditional grammar rule. Articles are also used (more often than with those of men) with the surnames of women: Gianni Rossi can be called il Rossi or (especially nowadays) simply Rossi, but Maria Bianchi is usually la Bianchi (also la Maria Bianchi). Placing the surname before the name is considered incorrect except in bureaucratic usage and is often stigmatised as a shibboleth of illiteracy. Names that are derived from possessions of noble families normally never had articles preceding them such as the House of Farnese (from a territorial holding) and the Cornaro family (from a prince-bishopric). Articles were omitted also for surnames with an identifiable foreign origin (including Latin ones) such as Cicerone. That practice somewhat resembles the Greek custom of placing definite articles before all names (see Greek names). The Greco- Italian practice even spread to French in the 17th century, especially in writings regarding figures in literature and painting such as le Poussin. For example, some Italian surnames of Greek sound descent: Papasidero, Papadopulo.

South Norwood Recreation Ground is on the other side of the road. The meadow covers an area of 8 acres (3.34 hectares). With meadows there are not usually many facilities. Heavers is no exception; the only facility stated on the council's website is a footpath through a flood meadow. However the meadow is good for commuters from Tennison Road and the surrounding area who are going to Victoria as Selhurst railway station is on the other side of the meadow. There is no gate on the Tennison Road side so it is never closed at night. The path through the meadow is very popular with cyclists.  History  The Meadow near Tennison Road In 1935, the area of Heavers Meadow and the adjacent allotments was passed to Croydon Corporation by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners to be used as an open space or recreation ground and allotments. Before 1900, the western side of the site was wooded and known as Dragnet Wood in 1800 and Selhurst Wood in 1867, by which time it had been split into two parts by railway development. Norbury Brook runs north west along the south- side of the meadow before being 'culverted' under Selhurst Road. The Brook can be seen later in Thornton Heath Recreation Ground and at the rear of houses in between. The brook is fenced off for safety reasons; after rainfall, water levels can rise considerably in a very short time as the water drains from surrounding areas.

The company's products include fixed blade knives, folding knives, swords, machetes, tomahawks, kukris, blowguns, walking sticks, and other martial arts items and training equipment. Their knives are used by military and law-enforcement personnel worldwide. Cold Steel is credited with popularizing the American tantō in 1980. Cold Steel marketed knives made for them in the U.S. by Camillus using a carbon steel given the trademarked name \\"Carbon V\\" (read \\"carbon five\\"). Their imported knives were nearly all made in Seki, Japan using AUS-8 which Cold Steel labelled \\"400 Series Stainless\\". They also had two models made in Taiwan, both of which switched to Japan in 2000. In 2007 Camillus New York went bankrupt and Cold Steel was forced to find a new manufacturer for their carbon steel fixed blades. Cold steel first went to Mainland China (People's Republic of China) but allegedly due to quality issues they switched to Taiwan for production. At the same time Cold Steel moved all of their folding knife manufacturing from Seki Japan to Taiwan. The carbon steel was SK5 and stainless was AUS-8 both imported to Taiwan from Japan. However the Sanmai III models remained strictly Seki production. Today, the knives made in Japan use VG-1 stainless steel and VG1 core Sanmai III, the Taiwan models use German 4116 stainless steel, D2 steel, 1055 high carbon steel, O-1 high carbon, SK-5 high carbon steel, Japanese AUS 8A stainless steel, American CTS XHP and CPM S35VN powder steels and American CPM 3V tool steel. The largest Sanmai III fixed blades are made by Hattori. Cold Steel's folding knives are renowned for their lock strength, due primarily to the introduction of the TRI-AD locking mechanism, designed by custom knife maker Andrew Demko. Cold Steel's swords are primarily made from 1055 high carbon steel and Damascus steel. Many of Cold Steel's products are designed by company President Lynn C Thompson and based upon traditional knife designs from all over the world, but Cold Steel has also collaborated with custom knife makers such as Andrew Demko, Phil Boguszewski, Zach Whitson, Steven Likarich, Keith Dehart, Rich McDonald, Bob Koga, Fred Perrin and Lloyd Pendleton on certain designs. Marketing Cold Steel is known for their graphic marketing videos and DVDs (entitled \\"PROOF\\") which demonstrate their products' strength, sharpness, edge retention and durability. Featured tests include piercing car hoods, using folding knives as monkey bars, slicing through large free-hanging pieces of meat and animal carcass, stabbing/slashing ballistic gel mannequins, and cutting Tatami rolls and free- hanging polyester rope with a single stroke. In the media Cold Steel's products feature heavily in movies, TV shows, games and web series. Their knives have seen prominent use in numerous action movies since the early 1980s. Many of Cold Steel's employees are martial artists and weapons experts, who feature in their infamous marketing videos. Some of the members of their \\"crew\\" are also Hollywood stunt men, fight choreographers and trainers, most notably Ron Balicki, Luke LaFontaine and Anthony De Longis. Thompson also writes regular articles regarding the use of knives for self-defense.

The course is designed to promote physical fitness training in the style attributed to Georges Hébert. In general, fitness trails can be natural or man-made, located in areas such as forest, transportation rights-of-way, parks, or urban settings. Equipment exists to provide specific forms of physiological exercise, and can consist of natural features including climbable rocks, trees, and river embankments, or manufactured products (stepping posts, chin-up and climbing bars) designed to provide similar physical challenges. The degree of difficulty of a course is determined by terrain slope, trail surface (dirt, grass, gravel, etc.), obstacle height (walls) or length (crawls) and other features. Urban parcourses tend to be flat, to permit participation by the elderly, and to accommodate cyclists, runners, skaters and walking. The new concept of an outdoor gym, containing traditional gym equipment specifically designed for outdoor use, is also considered to be a development of the parcourse. These outdoor exercise gyms include moving parts and are often made from galvanised metal. Ypsilanti Twp., MI thumb History The original parcours was invented in 1968 by Swiss architect Erwin Weckemann with support from Swiss life insurance firm Vita. The first course was built in Zurich, Switzerland. English tr. Hundreds of courses were built in Europe by 1972. Courses built in ensuing years included: * [US] 1976 \\"Parcour\\" exercise trail in County Farm Park in Ann Arbor, Michigan * [US] 1977 Bruce Jenner Trail in the Lake County, Illinois Forest Preserve District. * [US] El Estero Exercise Course at Lake El Estero, Monterey, California * [HK] 1977 Lion Rock Country Park, New Territories, Hong Kong, featuring 15 exercise stations. thumb Examples =United Kingdom= Fitness Trails (also called trim trails) are a series of wooden exercise stations, scattered in parkland or other locations beside a jogging or walking trail, which can be used to develop balance, strength and coordination. They are suitable for both adults and children, and the individual stations have been scientifically designed to provide a range of exercise. Most have simple instructions attached to them, and the stations include balance beams, sit-up bars, chin-up bars, parallel bars, and more challenging stations such as pole climbs and ladder walks. Trails can include stations for the upper body, lower body, balance & coordination and climbing/jumping equipment designed to test the whole body. Bristol City Council have now installed trim trails in six parks, ranging in complexity from Withywood Park, which has a single station, to Victoria Park, which has nine. Funding for the trim trail at Hollingworth Lake, in Greater Manchester, which was the idea of the Friends of Hollingworth Lake and opened in August 2010, was provided by the Big Lottery Community Spaces fund. =Australia= Installations are found across AU. =Canada= *Sunnybrook Park in Toronto, Ontario has a Vita Parcours Exercise Trail, along with sports facilities. *Seeley's Bay, Ontario has a 4km Vita Parcours trail through Haskins Point *Bay of St. Lawrence Park, near Gananoque, Ontario thumb =Luxembourg= * Among pedestrian trails there is a fitness trail in the village of Steinfort. =New Zealand= * Blockhouse Bay Recreation Reserve, City of Auckland New Zealand. =United States of America= California =San Francisco Bay Area= East Bay * An asphalt parcourse, remodeled in 2012, projects into the bay in Marina Park in San Leandro. * In Moraga, section 2 of the Lafayette-Moraga Regional Trail has an asphalt parcourse . * A dirt parcourse trail surrounds Bishop Ranch 7 office complex in San Ramon.

This format finished in the top five the first rating period with radio personality John Anderson on mornings before being sold in early 1987 after its second rating period suffered. New owners changed the format to album rock, with a lean musically toward classic rock as Fox 102 with the new call letters of WMFX. The changes paid off as the station was usually placed within the Top 5 of the Arbitron ratings since that time. In 1994, the station adjusted its format further toward classic rock and added the syndicated John Boy and Billy show for mornings. The station is owned by Alpha Media through Alpha Media Licensee LLC, which also owns Urban Contemporary WHXT, Urban AC WWDM, Hot AC WARQ, and AAA WPCO in the Columbia radio market. In March 2014, WMFX changed to mainstream rock, retaining the classic rock songs while adding alternative rock selections, from mostly 1990s artists such as Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins, and The Foo Fighters. 2000's Groups such as Nickelback, Staind, Hoobastank and Trapt are also heard on WMFX.

His most famous work, The London Spy, appeared in 18 monthly instalments from November 1698. It was described by its author as a \\"complete survey\\" of the London scene and published in book form in 1703. Biography =Early life= Ned Ward was born in 1667 in Oxfordshire. According to Theophilus Cibber, Ward was \\"a man of low extraction... who never received any regular education\\",Theophilus Cibber, The Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland (London, 1753). but he is likely to have been educated at one of the Oxfordshire grammar schools.Howard William Troyer, Ned Ward of Grubstreet; a study of sub-literary London in the eighteenth century, Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard UP, 1946. By 1691 Ward had made his way to London. His first publication, The Poet's Ramble After Riches, describes in humorous Hudibrastic couplets his poverty and his disappointment at not receiving an inheritance. Prose satires that followed were Female Policy Detected, or, The Arts of Designing Woman Laid Open (1695) and A Trip to Jamaica (1698). The latter recounts Ward's trip to Port Royal, Jamaica in 1687, satirised the way settlers were recruited to the Americas. Its success led to publication of A Trip to New England in 1699. =Literary success= Ward adapted the format of A Trip to Jamaica and A Trip to New England to his experiences of London in The London Spy, which was published in 18 monthly parts from November 1698.James Sambrook, 'Ward, Edward [Ned] (1667–1731)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004.

The London Spy was followed by over 100 satires in prose and verse, whose targets included ale-house keepers, dissenting ministers, lawyers and booksellers. He extended some of these works into periodicals, such as The Weekly Comedy, as it is Dayly Acted at most Coffee-Houses in London in 1699. =Political life= Ward was involved in political controversy from as early as 1698. A \\"High-Church Tory\\", he launched several attacks on low-church moderation and conformity, the first being Ecclesia et factio (Church and faction, 1698). Ward's best-known political publication, Hudibras Redivivus, issued in 24 monthly parts between 1705 and 1707, drew on topical political materials. Taken into custody both in February and June 1706, Ward was charged with seditious libel for accusing the Queen Anne of failing to support the Tories in Parliament, and was condemned to stand in the pillory. =Tavern life= Ward was publican at the King's Head Tavern, next to Gray's Inn, London, from 1699. In 1712 he opened an alehouse near Clerkenwell Green. His writings abated somewhat under King George I, focusing after 1712 on local and personal experiences, notably The Merry Travellers (1712), which discussed his own customers. From 1717 to about 1730, Ward kept the Bacchus Tavern in Moorfields. During this time his writings were still gaining popularity and spreading across to the Americas, where even Cotton Mather, the socially and politically influential New England Puritan minister, author and pamphleteer, warned in 1726 against \\"such Pestilences, and indeed all those worse than Egyptian Toads (the Spawns of a Butler, and a Brown, and a Ward...)\\". Close geographically to Grub Street, Moorfields offered Ward proximity to his readers. He became a target for Alexander Pope. Between late 1729 and late 1730, Ward left the Bacchus for the British Coffee House in Fullwood's Rents near Gray's Inn. Death On 20 June 1731 Ward died and was buried in the churchyard of the parish of Old St Pancras in north London on 27 June. His grave is lost and not listed on the Burdett-Coutts Memorial among the important graves there. His obituary in Applebee's Original Weekly Journal of 28 September 1731 published the names of his wife and children, but there is no record of his marriage. Works =Trip format= Ward drew on his own experiences in Port Royal to develop the \\"trip format\\", which he continued to use in the first decade of his prominence. He had travelled to Jamaica in the hope of escaping the poverty he experienced in London, but found things no more encouraging in the New World than the Old. This led him to write a biting attack, not only on the New World itself, but on the authors who had written about it in such glowing terms. This type of satirical account, first used by Ward on Jamaica, was extended by him to New England (which he did not visit), Islington, Sadler's Wells, Bath and Stourbridge. =Prose satires= In The London Spy, Ward presented the seamier side of life through graphic description, racy anecdotes and character sketches. Some such satires were expanded into periodicals, allowing for extended commentary on specific human and individual vices that Ward experienced personally, particularly within London and in his own taverns. =The Prisoner's Opera= In 1730 in the wake of the success of John Gay's The Beggar's Opera, Ward wrote the libretto for a similarly-themed ballad opera The Prisoner's Opera which was performed at Sadler's Wells. Bibliography Ward's popularity waned after his death, though The London Spy was serialised by several London and provincial newspapers in the 1730s. The New London Spy was used as a book title by Hunter Davies in 1966. References Ned Ward, The London Spy (1703). Edited by Kenneth Fenwick (1955).

Whether or not word formation and lexicalization refer to the same process is a source of controversy within the field of linguistics. Most linguists assert that there is a distinction, but there are many ideas of what the distinction is. Lexicalization may be simple, for example borrowing a word from another language, or more involved, as in calque or loan translation, wherein a foreign phrase is translated literally, as in marché aux puces, or in English, flea market. Other mechanisms include compounding, abbreviation, and blending. Particularly interesting from the perspective of historical linguistics is the process by which ad hoc phrases become set in the language, and eventually become new words. (See lexicon for details.) Lexicalization contrasts with grammaticalization, and the relationship between the two processes is subject to some debate. In psycholinguistics In psycholinguistics, lexicalization is the process of going from meaning to sound in speech production. The most widely accepted model, speech production, in which an underlying concept is converted into a word, is at least a two-stage process. First, the semantic form (which is specified for meaning) is converted into a lemma, which is an abstract form specified for semantic and syntactic information (how a word can be used in a sentence), but not for phonological information (how a word is pronounced). The next stage is the lexeme, which is phonologically specified.Harley, T. (2005) The Psychology of Language. Hove; New York: Psychology Press: 359 Some recent work has challenged this model, suggesting for example that there is no lemma stage, and that syntactic information is retrieved in the semantic and phonological stages.Caramazza, A.

The image was tagged \\"photo 51\\" because it was the 51st diffraction photograph that Franklin and Gosling had taken. It was critical evidence in identifying the structure of DNA. Use in discovering structure of DNA James Watson was shown the photo by his collaborator, Maurice Wilkins, as Raymond Gosling, the author of the picture, had returned under his supervision. Rosalind Franklin did not know this at the time because she was leaving King's College London. Randall, the head of the group, had asked Gosling to share all his data with Wilkins. Along with Francis Crick, Watson used characteristics and features of Photo 51, together with evidence from multiple other sources, to develop the chemical model of the DNA molecule. Their model, and manuscripts by Wilkins and colleagues, and Gosling and Franklin, were first published, together, in 1953, in the same issue of Nature. In 1962, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Watson, Crick and Wilkins. The prize was not awarded to Franklin; she had died four years earlier, and although there was not yet a rule against posthumous awards, the Nobel Committee generally does not make posthumous nominations. Likewise, Gosling's work was not cited by the prize committee. The photograph provided key information that was essential for developing a model of DNA. The diffraction pattern determined the helical nature of the double helix strands (antiparallel). The outside of the DNA chain has a backbone of alternating deoxyribose and phosphate moieties, and the base pairs, the order of which provides codes for protein building and thereby inheritance, are inside the helix. Watson and Crick's calculations from Gosling and Franklin's photography gave crucial parameters for the size and structure of the helix. Photo 51 became a crucial data source\\"The instant I saw the picture my mouth fell open and my pulse began to race.\\" -- James D. Watson (1968), The Double Helix, page 167. New York: Atheneum, Library of Congress card number 68-16217. Page 168 shows the X-shaped pattern of the B-form of DNA which provided details of the helical structure of DNA to both scientists Watson and Crick. that led to the development of the DNA model and confirmed the prior postulated double helical structure of DNA, which were presented in the series of three articles in the journal Nature in 1953. As historians of science have re-examined the period during which this image was obtained, considerable controversy has arisen over both the significance of the contribution of this image to the work of Watson and Crick, as well as the methods by which they obtained the image. Franklin had been hired independently of Maurice Wilkins, who, taking over as Gosling's new supervisor, showed Photo 51 to Watson and Crick without Franklin's knowledge. Whether Franklin would have deduced the structure of DNA on her own, from her own data, had Watson and Crick not obtained Gosling's image, is a hotly debated topic,Max Perutz and the Secret of Life. Published in the UK by Chatto & Windus (), and in the USA by the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. made more controversial by the negative caricature of Franklin presented in the early chapters of Watson's history of the research on DNA structure, The Double Helix. Watson admitted his distortion of Franklin in his book, noting in the epilogue: \\"Since my initial impressions about [Franklin], both scientific and personal (as recorded in the early pages of this book) were often wrong, I want to say something here about her achievements.\\" Cultural references *A 56-minute documentary DNA - Secret of Photo 51, was broadcast in 2003 on PBS NOVA.

As a prisoner of war, he was senior British officer in a number of camps and a noted escapee. Early life Day was born in Sarawak on Borneo on 3 August 1898, and grew up there. His grandfather had been a major in the 66th Foot before forming a private army for Charles Brooke, the second White Rajah of Sarawak. The army became known as the Sarawak Rangers. Day's father joined the Rajah's service and became a Sarawak resident.'Wings Day' by Sydney Smith page 26 Day's great-uncle was George Fiott Day, who had won the Victoria Cross during the Crimean War. He is also a descendant of George Miller Bligh, who was an officer on during the Battle of Trafalgar. Day was sent to England and was educated at Haileybury College, where he joined the Officers Cadet Corps. While on manoeuvres, he was wounded when shot in the back with a blank cartridge. Day joined the Royal Marines in 1916 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 31 August. First World War Day served with a Royal Marine detachment on the battleship . He was promoted to temporary lieutenant on 26 September 1917. On 9 November 1918, two days before the armistice, the ship was torpedoed and sunk. Day distinguished himself by twice returning below deck, through smoke and flames, to rescue two injured men trapped inside, including the wardroom steward. For this act of bravery, Day was awarded the Albert Medal (sea, second class). In 1971, all Albert Medal holders became eligible to exchange their award for a George Cross, which Day did.http://www.gc-database.co.uk/exchanges.htm Inter war years Day was promoted to lieutenant on 26 September 1919, with effect from 26 September 1917. His first command was with a marine detachment on , an , before joining . Later Day commanded the marine detachment of at the burning of Smyrna, helping to evacuate Greek survivors of the Turkish massacres. He also saw service with the fleet during the League of Nations involvement at Memel.Wings Day by Sydney Smith, page 27 Day stayed with the Royal Marines until 1924, when he moved to the Fleet Air Arm. On 16 June 1924, he received a temporary commission as a flying officer in the Royal Air Force while on a four-year attachment. He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 1 July 1928 before receiving a permanent commission in the same rank on 21 June 1930 (seniority from 1 July).http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1930/untitled0%20-%200861.html Day joined No. 23 Squadron RAF flying Gloster Gamecocks, with which he led the RAF Synchronised Aerobatics Display Team, which included Douglas Bader at the 1931 Hendon Air Show,Reach for the Sky by Paul Brickhill, page 41 and other displays.http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1931/1931%20-%200915.html He held posts at RAF Abu Sueir and Khartoum, was promoted to squadron leader on 1 August 1936, holding commands at Aboukir and Netheravon before commanding the Advanced Flying Training School at Little Rissington.Wire & Walls by Charles Rollings, page 246 When war was imminent Day was promised a staff job at RAF Bomber Command headquarters, but he requested to join an operational squadron. This was approved, and on 1 July 1939 he was promoted to wing commander and placed in command of No. 57 Squadron RAF, stationed at RAF Upper Heyford. Second World War Day was over 40 when the Second World War began, and with No. 57 Squadron he moved to Metz as part of the air component of the British Expeditionary Force, equipped with the Bristol Blenheim light bomber.Wire & Walls by Charles Rollings, page 67 He volunteered to carry out the squadron's first operational mission, a flight from Metz to reconnoitre Hamm-Hannover-Soest on 13 October 1939. His Blenheim, L1138,Record for Blenheim L1138 on lostaircraft.com was shot down by a Me109 flown by Unteroffizier Stephan Lutjens, of 11./JG 53 near Birkenfeld. Day bailed out, suffering burns to his face and hands, but otherwise landed safely by parachute. He was immediately captured by the Germans and placed in the custody of Luftwaffe doctor Hermann Gauch.Sigfrid Gauch, Traces of my Father, Northwestwern University Press, pp. 81–2. His two crew-mates, Sergeant E.B. Hillier and AC1 F.G. Moller were killed.Wings Day by Sydney Smith, page 19RAF Bomber Command Losses 1939–40, WR Chorley, page 18 Prisoner of war Upon his capture, Day became a prisoner of war. He spent a few days at a German Army hospital having his burns treated before spending two weeks at a small camp at Oberursel (which later became known as Dulag Luft). He was then sent to Oflag IX-A/H at Spangenberg, arriving there at the end of October.Wings Day by Sydney Smith, page 28 He took over the role of senior British officer at this camp and became responsible for the well-being of the handful of British RAF prisoners who had entered captivity so early in the war. Day, with six RAF and five French POWs, left Oflag IX-A/H in December 1939 to be sent to Dulag Luft near Oberursel to become a 'permanent' staff at this new transit camp. =Dulag Luft= Day, again due to his seniority in rank, held the post of senior British officer and also headed the permanent staff whose job was to help newly captured aircrew adapt to life as prisoners of war. Until the Norwegian Campaign began in April 1940, very few prisoners entered the camp, and life was fairly relaxed. Day got on well with the German commandant, Major Rumpel. The permanent staff were also allowed out on parole walk and enjoyed ample Red Cross food and a good relationship with the German guards. This 'privileged friendliness' caused suspicion with newly captured RAF aircrew who passed through the camp, and many accusations of collaboration were made against Day and his other colleagues.Wings Day by Sydney Smith, page 65 In fact, Day had been sending intelligence back home in coded letters, and together with other members of the permanent staff, including Roger Bushell, Jimmy Buckley and Johnnie Dodge, he had been active in construction of a tunnel, starting from under his bed, which was completed in the spring of 1941.Wings Day by Sydney Smith, page 71 In June 1941, Day and 17 others tunnelled out of the camp. This was the first mass escape of the war. Day travelled on foot alone, aiming to walk down the Moselle Valley and into France, but was recaptured five days later, looking like a tramp.Wings Day by Sydney Smith page 77 All the escapers were recaptured and after spending a few days in jail at Frankfurt am Main, were transferred to Stalag Luft I.WO208/3269 Official Camp History – Dulag Luft Chapter II Para 24 Major Rumpel congratulated Day on his attempt.'Wings Day by Sydney Smith page 79 =Stalag Luft I= Day arrived at Stalag Luft I in July 1941 and immediately took over the role of senior British officer. Any suspicions felt about Day from his time at Dulag Luft were quickly dissolved when the other inmates of the camp learnt of his exploits. At this camp, Day set up an escape organisation, headed by Jimmy Buckley, by which all escape attempts, intelligence gathering and escape preparations were controlled. This organisation became the model used at all other allied POW camps for the remainder of the war.AIR40/1489 – Letter of Recommendation by Herbert Massey dated 4/7/45Escape from Germany by Aidan Crawley, page 101 Day partly oversaw a mass escape attempt in August 1941 when 12 officers tried to escape using a tunnel; however, the escape was discovered as the third person left the exit, and all three escapers were recaptured.WO208/3282 Official Camp History – SL1 – Chapter II para 24 =Stalag Luft III and Oflag XXI-B= When Stalag Luft I was closed in March 1942, Day and all RAF inmates were transferred to the east compound at the newly built Stalag Luft III at Sagan. Here he made a second escape attempt using a forged interpreter's pass. While in solitary confinement after that attempt, he tried a third escape but was again recaptured. In October 1942, Day was sent to Oflag XXI-B at Schubin where in March 1943 he escaped through the latrine tunnel with William Ash, Peter Stevens, Aidan Crawley and others. This time Day headed east to Poland, hoping to get on a ship to Sweden. He was recaptured and sent back to Schubin, before being transferred back to Sagan. =Stalag Luft III and the Great Escape= Together with Roger Bushell, he planned and organised the \\"Great Escape\\". On 24 March 1944, Day and 75 others escaped and he made his way to Stettin. Disguised as a British colonel under guard by another escapee (Pavel Tobolski), who was dressed as a German soldier, they travelled by train, through Berlin, reaching Stettin on the evening of the next day. There they sought help from some French workers and were taken to a workers' camp. However, they were betrayed by an informer in the camp and arrested the following day. After a brief stay in the local jail, Day was taken to Berlin and was interviewed by Arthur Nebe, the man who selected the 50 escapers to be murdered, which included Tobolski. Day was spared execution. Day later said that Hitler had ordered his execution personally, but that Hermann Goering had asked him to relent because Day and his family were so well known to the public. =Sachsenhausen concentration camp and Tyrol= After interrogation by the Gestapo, he was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp, from where he and four others (including three survivors from the Great Escape) managed another tunnel escape. After another visit to Gestapo headquarters, he was held in solitary confinement in the death cells at Sachsenhausen. In February 1945, Day was transferred to Dachau via Flossenburg. In April 1945, he was transferred to South Tyrol together with other prominent prisoners. He made one final escape attempt in the final weeks of the war when the prisoners had limited freedom within the city limits while being held in Villa Bassa (now Niederdorf). On 28 April, Day stole a Volkswagen and drove to the Allied lines where he informed the Allied Forces of the hostage situation in Tyrol. However, the following day, one of the German prisoners, Colonel von Bonin, telephoned Captain Wichard von Alvensleben in nearby Bozen, asking him to send his Wehrmacht unit to Villa Bassa to protect the prisoners from the SS guards. The Wehrmacht troops freed the hostages on 30 April after forcing their guards to flee. For his services while a prisoner, Day was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. He was also awarded the United States Legion of Merit in the degree of Officer for his services to American POWs. Later life Day was promoted to group captain in 1946, before retiring from service in 1950. He acted as technical adviser for the films Reach for the Sky and The Great Escape.Wires and Walls by Charles Rollings, page 246 The book Wings Day by Sydney Smith is an account of Day's exploits as a prisoner of war. Sydney-Smith was also a POW and was held with Day for several years. Day also heavily features in the biography of Douglas Bader Reach for the Sky by Paul Brickhill and The Great Escape, also by Brickhill. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in November 1961. Married to Margo, Day lived mainly in the Isle of Wight or at 6 Trevor Square, London. He died in the Blue Sisters Hospital, Malta, on 11 March 1977, aged 78.

The tenth tropical cyclone, seventh named storm, and third hurricane of the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season, Gabrielle developed on August 30 from a tropical wave near the west coast of Africa. Under favorable conditions, the depression intensified and became Tropical Storm Gabrielle early on the following day. Rapid strengthening occurred thereafter, with Gabrielle reaching hurricane intensity early on September 1\\\\. After becoming a hurricane, further intensification was steady, though by September 5, Gabrielle peaked as a moderate Category 4 hurricane. On the following day, Gabrielle began to slowly level-off in intensity, while gradually curving northward. After weakening to a Category 2 hurricane, the storm passed east of Bermuda on September 8\\\\. Gabrielle eventually decelerated, and by early on September 10, it curved westward and weakened to a tropical storm. Gabrielle re-curved northeastward on September 11 and began paralleling Nova Scotia. It further weakened to a tropical depression on September 12 and was then absorbed by a developing storm near Newfoundland on September 13\\\\. Due to its large size, Gabrielle produced swells and high tides in the Lesser Antilles, Bermuda, the East Coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada. Rough seas along the East Coast of the United States caused one fatality in Maine, two in Massachusetts, one in New Jersey, and four in New York. In Nova Scotia, large waves swept one man to sea and eventually caused his drowning. Meteorological history A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 28 and entered into the Atlantic Ocean. Initially, the wave had moderate amounts of deep convection and was already well organized, which allowed it to quickly become a tropical cyclone. Based on ship reports, the wave was classified as Tropical Depression Ten beginning at 1200 UTC on August 30\\\\. Located 1,000 miles (1,609 km) southeast of Tropical Storm Felix, the depression tracked westward as a high pressure ridge formed between the two storms. Satellite imagery showed the depression developing a good outflow pattern. As a result, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Gabrielle on August 31\\\\. It was noted that by as early as 1200 UTC later that day, Gabrielle was already rather large and well-defined. Gabrielle continued to move westward at 17 mph (27 km/h), and by early on September 1, the storm was upgraded to a hurricane. However, the storm was not operationally upgraded to a hurricane until late on September 2; Gabrielle was then located about 625 miles (1006 km) west of Cape Verde. After becoming a hurricane on September 1, Gabrielle continued to intensify, but at a slower pace. By 1200 UTC on September 2, the storm strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane while centered about halfway between the Leeward Islands and Cape Verde. Early on the following day, Gabrielle became a major hurricane when it reached Category 3 intensity. Later on September 3, a ridge of high pressure formed a wedge between Gabrielle and Hurricane Felix. At 2046 UTC on September 3, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reconnaissance aircraft flight reported a pressure of , which was the lowest barometric pressure recorded in association with Gabrielle. It was later noted that the aircraft may not have entered the area with the most intense winds. Although barometric pressures slowly increased, Gabrielle continued to intensify, and by September 4, it became a Category 4 hurricane. Later that day, a trough extending from the Atlantic Canada southeastward to the Florida/Georgia border caused Gabrielle to recurve northwestward. Hurricane Gabrielle southeast of Nova Scotia on September 8, 1989. At 0000 UTC on September 5, Gabrielle reached its maximum sustained wind speed of 145 mph (230 km/h), though the barometric pressure was slightly higher than late on September 3. A hurricane hunter aircraft flown into the storm on September 5 reported that hurricane force winds extended 100 miles (161 km) from the center and tropical storm force winds 250 miles (402 km). At the time, Gabrielle was recurving west-northwest at 15 mph (24 km/h). Hours later, another recon flight into Gabrielle revealed that the barometric pressure was slowly rising and the eye began to expand which is sign that the storm was slowly weakening. However, forecasters were unsure if the weakening was temporary or definite, prompting one meteorologist to say that \\"Gabrielle may have reached its peak intensity, but its too early to tell\\", to explain the uncertainty of Gabrielle’s strength and if the storm will strengthen even further. The storm passed northeastward of the Leeward Islands and turned northward in response to a weakening in the ridge of high pressure caused by Hurricane Felix. Early on September 7, Gabrielle was downgraded to a Category 3 hurricane. Only six hours later, the storm further weakened to a Category 2 hurricane. While a Category 2 hurricane, Gabrielle passed east of Bermuda early on September 8\\\\. Further weakening occurred and later that day, the storm was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane. By early on September 9, Gabrielle began decelerating as it interacted with a frontal trough extending north to south across the western Atlantic Ocean, before becoming stationary about 475 miles (764 km) southeast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts on the following day. At 0600 UTC on September 10, Gabrielle weakened to a tropical storm. While being downgraded to a tropical storm, Gabrielle began drifting slowly westward in an area of weak steering well south of the jet stream. The storm later turned back eastward, ahead of an approaching cold front. On September 12, Gabrielle further weakened to a tropical depression, while being forced northeastward by a frontal trough. The depression lost most of its tropical characteristics, and by 1800 UTC on September 13, it merged with a storm system developing near Newfoundland on September 13. Preparations The National Hurricane Center stated in its forecast on September 3 that Gabrielle had a 10 percent chance of affecting the Leeward Islands in three days. On September 5, meteorologists forecast the storm to bypass north of the Virgin Islands and told the press that it is too early to suggest that the storm might hit the United States four or five days ahead of its current position. As Hurricane Gabrielle moved west-northwest, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center advised residents along the East Coast of the United States to monitor the storm because of its large size and strong swells it is producing. When Gabrielle, recurved northwestward, the National Hurricane Center forecast the outer edge of the hurricane to graze Bermuda, bringing tropical storm force winds and strong waves to the island. In Bermuda, cruise ships and other water craft were advised of rough seas and many residents rushed to stores to buy emergency supplies. Impact Rough seas from Hurricane Gabrielle viewed from a hurricane hunter aircraft. Although Gabrielle remained far from land throughout its duration, its large size caused swells in the Lesser Antilles, the East Coast of the United States, Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada. Minor to moderate coastal flooding damage occurred in the Leeward Islands and the British Virgin Islands. Along the East Coast of the United States, rough seas caused one fatality in Maine, two in Massachusetts, one in New Jersey, and four in New York. Additionally, swells in Atlantic Canada caused one drowning fatality in Nova Scotia. =Lesser Antilles and Bermuda= In Barbados, Gabrielle brought 10 feet (3 m) waves and flooding to the island nation, causing minor damage. There were no fatalities or injuries. In Dominica and Guadeloupe, waves from Gabrielle caused severe beach erosion along the north and east coasts of the island but moderate damage was reported. However, the erosion brought by Gabrielle and later Hurricane Hugo resulted loss of 14 feet (4.4 m) of beach. The Caribbean islands of Nevis and British Virgin Islands also sustained minor to moderate beach erosion. In Bermuda, waves of 10–20 feet (4.6–6 m) were reported. =United States= Waves between 5 and 13 feet (1.5–4 meters) were reported along the East Coast of the United States from Florida to Maryland. A weather buoy in Outer Banks, North Carolina reported swells up to 10 feet (3 meters). One death occurred by drowning in New Jersey. A 37‑year‑old man was reported missing in New York City and presumed dead after his houseboat capsized in the heavy surf. Another houseboat also capsized, drowning a 58‑year‑old woman. On shore, a large wave swept two fishermen into the sea, where they drowned. Overall, four fatalities occurred in the state of New York. In Rhode Island two teenagers were rescued by the United States Coast Guard after being swept into the water by the waves. Near Boston, Massachusetts, a 25‑year‑old man was reported missing in the Ipswich River north of Cape Ann after a motorboat capsized in the rough surf; two other occupants including an infant were rescued. Elsewhere in the state, two deaths were reported, both of which were related to rough surf. The United States Coast Guard rescued two surfers in New Hampshire, while looking for a swimmer who was reported missing earlier. In Tenants Harbor, Maine, a 19‑year‑old woman drowned after slipping off a rock shoreline. Two men who were with her tried to rescue the woman but to no avail as the rough seas overpowered them. The men themselves were later rescued by the crew of a fishing boat. Overall, Gabrielle caused eight fatalities along the East Coast of the United States. =Atlantic Canada= Just offshore of Nova Scotia, waves reached in height; a buoy near Shearwater measured swells up to . Along the coastline, waves were about two stories high. In Gill Cove, two men walking near the shore were swept away by a large wave; one made it safely back to the coastline, though the other was lost and subsequently drowned. Rough sea also lashed Newfoundland, which caused 20 ships to be sheltered in the St. John's harbor.

Early Days Born in London, England, Pridmore began racing motorcycles in England in the early 1960s winning his first race at Silverstone. As a young man, he made the decision to sell all his possessions and move to the United States. He settled in Southern California and soon began competing in local motorcycle events, racing four-stroke production-based machines. In early 1970s he raced BMW R75/5 in production class and a F750 with a frame by Englishman Rob North in A.M.A. Nationals. US Superbikes Sears showing (at rear of machine 163) from left, Pierre des Roches, Reg Pridmore (seated, in white leathers) and Keith Code wearing short jacket In 1976, the A.M.A. introduced a new national championship for production-based bikes. Riding a BMW R90S sponsored by BMW's American importer, Butler & Smith, Pridmore impressed the motorcycling world by winning the national championship against more advanced Japanese machinery. In 1977 he raced a Kawasaki Z1000 for the Racecrafters team with (the late) Pierre des Roches and Keith Code, claiming the first A.M.A. superbike championship for a Japanese manufacturer. Pridmore went on to win the A.M.A. Superbike Championship in 1978 riding for the Vetter team, again on a Pierre des Roches prepared Kawasaki. He was 39 years old when he won his final championship, making him the oldest A.M.A. Superbike champion. He retired after the 1979 season.

Early life and education Robert James Ashfield was born in 1911 at Chipstead, Surrey. Educated at Tonbridge School and the Royal College of Music (RCM), he inherited his considerable musical talent from his mother, a fine amateur musician. At the RCM he was taught and inspired by Sir Ernest Bullock, then organist of Westminster Abbey, and became his assistant. Ashfield became a Fellow of the Royal College of Organists in 1932, and then served as organist of St John's, Smith Square, London, from 1934 until 1941. After being awarded his doctorate by the University of London in 1941, he served in the Army during the Second World War. Southwell After his war service, he was, in 1946, appointed \\"magister and rector chori\\" at Southwell Minster. Here he was fortunate in receiving the full support of the Provost, Hugh Heywood. He began by establishing a regular and disciplined rehearsal routine, and before long the choir was known for its bold and incisive sound. Ashfield also increased the range of choral repertoire performed, and expanded other areas of musical life within the cathedral. He also edited and compiled the \\"Southwell Psalter\\", a setting of each of the 150 Psalms to Anglican chant, which is still used at both Southwell and New College, Oxford. Rochester After 10 years at Southwell, he moved to Rochester Cathedral in 1956 as organist and master of the choristers. Over the next 21 years he also made his mark on the local community, notably as conductor of the Rochester Choral Society. From 1958 until 1977, he also taught at the RCM. His arrival at Rochester coincided with the opportunity to redesign and completely rebuild the cathedral organ. In consultation with the organ builders, J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd, Ashfield rejected much of the piecemeal work that had gone before producing, in 1960, an instrument with a traditional feel but well-suited to the needs of the cathedral. He retired from his cathedral post in 1977, but remained in Rochester until his death in December 2006. Composition His practical experience of the liturgy allowed him to write well for voices. Many of his anthems, services, responses, chants and other choral works, often written for special occasions, have retained their place in the repertoire. perhaps best known is his setting of Lionel Johnson's 1895 poem, The Fair Chivalry, commissioned for the Southwell Diocesan Choral Festival of 1949. Following his retirement, his compositional output increased due to the greater amount of time he could commit to it. To an already large set of works was added much chamber music, an opera, The Bishop's Candlestick, and many instrumental pieces. Of all the compositions, his own favourite remained a setting of Robert Bridges's Christmas Eve, commissioned by David Poulter and the Tudor Consort for voices and a chamber ensemble including harp, flute, oboe and string quartet. Administrative influence In the late 1960s, relations between clergy and musicians in the Church of England became increasingly strained over the question of fees and salaries. Ashfield represented the Royal College of Organists, working initially in partnership with William Cole, of the Associated Board, and Gerald Knight, director of the Royal School of Church Music, he helped to provide a series of recommendations. However, following delays in their acceptance, Ashfield unilaterally produced his own suggested set of fees. Subsequently championed by The Church Times, the Ashfield Scale, as it became known, stayed in vogue throughout the decade. He was also a member of the council of the Royal College of Organists, Fellow of the Guild of Church Musicians and a special commissioner of the Royal School of Church Music.

He was the only son of Lord Arthur Francis Hill and Ishabel Wilhelmina Sheila MacDougall.Mosley, Charles, editor. Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 107th edition, 3 volumes. Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003 He successfully re- established his Ulster-based landowning family in North Yorkshire following the Irish Land Acts and the creation of Bracknell New Town, which had largely deprived him of his original estates. Life Clifton Castle, North Yorkshire Hill was born in Brompton Square, London. As a youth he was taught the oboe by Leon Goossens. At Eton College he captained the school shooting VIII and led it to win the Asburton Shield at Bisley. On leaving school, he did his National Service with the Royal Scots Greys in Germany from 1948 to 1950. Life in Ardingly, a discount house and chartered accountancy followed, with awards of ACA in 1959 and FCA 1962. In 1963 he took up farming. The family's Irish domains and their Berkshire estate with its 1870s retro-Jacobean Burne-Jones and Morris windowed mansion at Easthampstead had both become alienated and sold. His predecessors had not found alternatives, so the young Hill, now in possession of a wife and heir, was in need of a seat. He found Clifton Castle, on the banks of the River Ure in North Yorkshire, of which Pevsner had written: 'built in 1802–10, and not at all in the castle mood'. In March 1989 Hill succeeded his uncle in his eight peerages: five of Ireland and three of Great Britain. The need to satisfy the Treasury immediately led Downshire, as he was now known, into a mild controversy. The 2nd Marquess had married the heir of the last Trumbull. This inheritance included the Easthampstead estate, near Bracknell, west of Windsor, and with it the Trumbull papers. These comprised 388 volumes of manuscripts collected by Sir William Trumbull (1639–1716), British Ambassador to Paris, and to Constantinople, and his grandson William Trumbull, British Resident in Brussels. The archive – featuring letters by Stuart kings, Philip II of Spain, Marie de' Medici, Bacon, Donne, Dryden, Fenton, Alexander Pope and Georg Rudolf Weckherlin – had been on loan to Berkshire Record Office. In the summer of 1989 the collection was sent to Sotheby's in London, divided into 63 lots and prepared for sale, with an estimate of £2.5m. Breakup was avoided as on the eve of the November sale the auction was cancelled and the British Library took the papers. (The 388 volumes are now catalogued as Add MS 72242-72621.) House of Lords Taking his seat in the House of Lords in November 1989, he joined the Conservative benches. A member of the Lords bridge-team, he was a rare speaker, but had become increasingly more attentive. By the time of his expulsion in 1999, he was the most attentive of the seven Irish Marquesses. In ten years in the Lords he made two speeches and laid down one written question. His maiden speech, made in October 1994, was part of a debate taking note of 'recent developments in Northern Ireland'. In reply for the Opposition, the late Lord Williams of Mostyn said of it: '.. I hope I may, with respect, point to one, the maiden speech of the noble Marquess, Lord Downshire, a speech which I personally found to be of interest and of great content, both of which are adjectives one cannot normally ascribe to maiden speeches.' He said: '... it would be fair to say that Ireland as a whole, as other noble Lords have said, has had a turbulent history and that fact has been emphasised by its continuance in Ulster. There are a multiplicity of reasons for that phenomenon, although some try to award part of the blame to the equivocal manner in which Ireland has been treated successively by England, Great Britain and the United Kingdom. I would not subscribe entirely to that view, although I believe that, in establishing a link between England and Ireland, fundamental mistakes were made at the start which are taking many centuries to resolve ... [T]here is no doubt that the joint declaration marks a sea change in contemporary Irish politics. The opportunity it affords for all who hold both the Province and Ireland as a whole most dear they will ignore at their peril.' In a debate entitled 'Pylons in the Vale of York' of March 1995, he pointed to new problems regarding public-private finance, landowners and compulsory purchase: 'there could come a time, and it will surely come, when the pylon-builders' purse runs out and compulsory purchase arrives. Surely, there then arises a more potent conflict of interest-the invocation of public power in order to provide private profit.' This was notably astute, as the private profit in this case was to be Enron's. His one written question referred to the \\"Targets of the Pesticides\\" safety-directive. Marriages In 1957 he married Juliet Weld-Forester, a daughter of the 7th Baron Forester. She died in 1986. They had three children, Arthur, Anthony and Georgina. In 1989 he married Diana Hibbert Cross, a daughter of Sir Ronald Hibbert Cross, Bt. She died in 1998. He married thirdly Tessa Prain in 2003. Death He died on 18 December 2003, aged 74, survived by his two sons and one daughter by his first marriage, and by his third wife. His elder son, who until then used the courtesy title of Earl of Hillsborough, succeeded him and also became Baron Sandys in 2013.

The programme was most recently presented by Guy Johnson and Anna Edwards. History The original Europe Tonight was a 30-minute market review broadcast on weekdays at 6:30pm CET until 2001. The programme was relaunched in September 2004, and replaced Frankfurt Closing Bell, which was shown at 8pm CET and co-presented from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange by Silvia Wadhwa and by Simon Hobbs in London. Until 2004, the Deutsche Börse remained open later than the other European markets - until 20:00 CET. After the hours of electronic trading on the Xetra system were changed so as to stop at 17:30 CET, Wadhwa remained as co-host of the new Europe Tonight. The programme time, previously filled by updates on late German trade was replaced by interviews with Frankfurt-based strategists, commentators and CEOs. The remainder of this version of the programme was essentially an update of European Closing Bell, in which Hobbs reviewed the day's business events and covered any late breaking news. 2007 revamp The programme length was extended from 30 minutes to one hour on 26 March 2007 as part of schedule changes at the network, which also saw European Closing Bell have its runtime halved. Johnson was installed as presenter, the show was given a new title sequence and its theme music was changed from that formerly used by Closing Bell to that used by Street Signs before December 2005. The format of the programme was heavily revamped, gaining some of the segments previously contained in the second hour of European Closing Bell, such as a daily Guest Investor. New features introduced included The Editor, where the editor of a European business publication discussed how they will be covering notable events, and an update on the U.S. markets which came live from the NASDAQ MarketSite. Wadhwa no longer acted as co-host of Europe Tonight, but remained a contributor to the show. Anna Martin joined Johnson as co-host of the programme in January 2008, having previously been the show's regular reporter. The show's timeslot was brought forward by an hour to 7pm CET from 4 February 2008. Europe Tonight did not return after the 2009 Christmas holiday season.

The picture was made by Universal Pictures and produced by Michael Kraike from a screenplay by Oscar Saul and Andrew Solt, based on the play Bonaventure by Charlotte Hastings. The music score was by Hans J. Salter and the cinematography by William H. Daniels. Plot Sister Mary Bonaventure is in charge of the hospital ward of a convent in the county of Norfolk, England. She is troubled by her own sister's suicide, which she confides to her Mother Superior. A torrential rain closes nearby roads, causing Sergeant Melling of the police to bring condemned murderer Valerie Carns there. She is being taken to prison. Valerie was convicted of poisoning her brother Jason, a pianist. Jason's physician, Dr. Jeffreys, is head of the hospital where Sister Mary now works. Valerie still proclaims her innocence, but Jeffreys insists that she gave Jason a fatal overdose of his medicine. A photograph of Jason clearly disturbs Isabel Jeffreys, the doctor's wife. He gives her a sedative. Valerie appeals to Sister Mary to bring her fiancé, Sidney Kingham, to the convent to see her. A servant tells Sister Mary about the sadistic behavior of Jason Carns and produces a love letter to him, clearly written by Isabel. Mother Superior is upset by Sister Mary's meddling. She burns the letter. The nun still intends to tell Melling the police sergeant what she knows. Dr. Jeffreys is the one who gave Jason the fatal dose, and he might be slowly poisoning Isabel as well. He lures Sister Mary to a bell tower, where he attacks her. She rings the bell. Sidney hears it, rushes to her aid and overpowers Jeffreys, who is arrested by Melling. Sister Mary's faith is restored, believing the rain that delivered Valerie to her to be divine intervention.

WKSI-FM is owned and operated by iHeartCommunications, Inc. History 98.3 FM signed on August 28, 1967 as WZFM, a local station serving Charles Town, West Virginia. The station was co- owned with WXVA (1550 AM) by Arthur W. Arundel, who at the time owned WAVA Arlington and the Leesburg-based Loudoun Times-Mirror newspaper. WZFM simulcast WXVA's broadcasting day, which was full service with blocks of country music. The two stations were sold in 1970 to electrical engineer John P. Luce. The simulcast split around this time as the AM side was switched to top-40 and the FM station went to full-time country. Luce sold to Heritage Broadcasting Corporation in September 1982. Heritage changed the callsign to WXVA-FM after taking control. After an initial return to simulcasting 1550 AM (which had flipped to middle-of-the-road) immediately after the change, the station settled on light adult contemporary around 1986. In 1993, another format change took place, this time to oldies. Unusually for an FM station, Broadcasting Yearbook reported that it operated 19 hours a day – signing off between midnight and 5 a.m. A flip back to country as \\"Xtra Country 98\\" took place in late 1995. The station remained in Charles Town, but was a rimshot to Winchester, regularly showing up in the ratings there despite competition from local country stalwart WUSQ-FM. Clear Channel (now iHeartMedia) bought WXVA-FM from Heritage in 2000. As it already owned WUSQ-FM, it sought to tap the larger Winchester market with a different format instead of competing with itself. On December 10, 2003, Clear Channel applied to move the transmitter to WUSQ-FM's site near Round Hill, Frederick County, Virginia, changing the city of license from Charles Town to Stephens City. The station immediately began stunting as \\"Christmas 98.3\\" with Christmas music and spots advising listeners to tune to WUSQ-FM for country. The flip to CHR as \\"Kiss 98.3\\" WKSI-FM came on December 26, although the physical move was not completed until late 2004. =HD2 subchannel= On August 22, 2013, WKSI began simulcasting its HD2 signal on newly acquired translator W239BV, broadcasting on 95.7, from WKSI's tower west of Winchester. The HD2 signal aired the \\"Today's Mix\\" format, one of iHeartMedia Premium Choice formats. On November 1, 2013 W239BV switched its format from Hot Adult Contemporary to a seasonal All-Christmas music format, with the \\"Mix 95-7\\" branding remaining.

Life  On 19 December 1928, Sigbert Jon Prais was born in Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany; he was the oldest of four children to orthodox Jewish parents. His family arrived in Britain in 1934 as Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi oppression in Germany. Prais' father established a manufacturing company that made metal frames and ornaments for women's handbags, in Birmingham. Prais was sent to school in London and later continued his studies at the King Edward's School, Birmingham. From King Edward's School, he matriculated to the University of Birmingham for his undergraduate studies and then moved on to the PhD program at the Department of Applied Economics at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge. While at Cambridge, Prais collaborated with Hendrik Houtthaker on a study that focused on pre-war household expenditures. In 1955, Prais and Houtthaker's study was published as \\"Analysis of Family Budgets\\"; the study would prove to be a foundation for studies in subsequent research. Prais had found great success in the field of economics after having his study published and was quickly asked to be a lecturer at the Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge Department of Applied Economics. In 1953, when Prais was 24 years old, he took up a fellowship at the Cowles Commission for Research in Economics in Chicago. There he made important connections for his career, most notably C. B. Winsten. Together, Prais and Winsten conceived their \\"Prais–Winsten estimation\\". They formulated the econometric equation as a modification to the \\"Cochrane–Orcutt estimation\\" equation; it is believed to a more efficient formula for estimating the linear model. In 1954, Prais maintained his lecturer position at the Department of Applied Economics at the Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge University while pursuing his career at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) in London. From NIESR, Prais instantly went to work with Peter Hart on research into the growth of Great Britain companies. Prais and Hart's research led to the publication of two important studies on the matter: the first in 1956, titled \\"The Analysis of Business Concentration: A Statistical Approach\\", and second in 1976, \\"The Evolution of Giant Firms in Britain\\". In the 1960s, Prais left academia and the field of economics for a full decade; he took up work in Birmingham in the industrial trade. He worked at his father's business as the finance director, and led the company to a successful flotation on the London Stock Exchange in 1964. After leaving the family business, Prais decided to re-enter academia and the field of economics. He started back on with NIESR, and at first focused on researching an answer to why Great Britain's industrial performance had seemed to be lagging. He soon came to the conclusion that poor quality education and training were the root of the problem. His growing interests in the study and comparisons of different countries' educational systems and methods came to be internationally renowned. In 1987, Prais' innovative and expert analysis of international educational systems led to his appointment to the Kenneth Baker's mathematics working group. While on the group, Prais campaigned hard to raise the standards of education in Great Britain. In 1985, Prais was elected a fellow to the British Academy. On 22 February 2014, Prais died from colon cancer. Education Prais was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, the University of Birmingham (MCom) and Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge (PhD 1953, ScD 1974).

The Alpha Media outlet is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to broadcast at 101.3 MHz with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100 kW from a transmitter east of Fort Jackson. The station goes by the name 1013 The Big DM and its current slogan is \\"Your #1 Station for R&B;\\". Its studios are located in Columbia. History 101.3 began as WFIG-FM in 1961, licensed to Sumter, South Carolina with 3,000 watts of power. At the time, the station was simulcasting the country format of sister AM WFIG 1290. In 1973, DJ Pete Boss convinced Miles to allow him the opportunity to program R&B; music on WFIG-FM during the evening hours of 7 to 10 PM in exchange for selling the advertising time for his show. The R&B; show became successful and the hours were eventually extended throughout the rest of the broadcast day on WFIG-FM. In 1975, the FM call letters were changed to WWDM to solidify its change to full- time urban contemporary. In 1976, WWDM increased its transmitting power from the 3,000 watts that it was licensed at sign-on, to 100,000 watts. Because of the station's geographical location near the center of the state, as well as the few high-powered FMs in the area at the time, over time, with excellent programming and attention paid to public service, the station became an important voice in the South Carolina African-American community. It has won numerous awards over the years for its news programming and features, which contributed to WWDM's dominance over most urban stations in the market that came and went. In the mid-1980s, the station languished in the middle of the Columbia ratings, bested by lower-power stations in similar formats, licensed to Columbia. Then-owner and General Manager John Marshall sought higher ratings and sales. He engaged consultant Dean Landsman to conduct market research and to consult the station. Under Landsman's programming (with heavy research and computer programs written by Marshall and Landsman), the station became format dominant, as well as going on to rank either number 1 or 2 in the Columbia Arbitron ratings. Landsman remained as consultant, and brought in Program Director Andre Carson. Under Carson as PD the station ranked at the top of the market. Marshall retired and put the station in the hands of Steve Paterson as GM. By the late 1990s, long after Landsman and Carson were gone, and Marshall had sold the property, WWDM suffered a minor setback when it was outranked in listenership by new-coming urban stations WLXC (the only other Urban AC) and WHXT. WWDM, at the time, played hip hop and R&B.; To curtail excessive competition, ICBC (the owners) bought WHXT, and WWDM restructured its urban contemporary format to serve the adult Black demographics. Today, WWDM is home to two syndicated shows: The Steve Harvey Morning Show and The D.L. Hughley Show in the afternoons. The station is owned by Alpha Media through licensee Alpha Media Licensee LLC, which also owns Urban Contemporary WHXT, Modern rock WMFX, Hot AC WARQ, and AAA WPCO in the Columbia radio market which acquired the stations in a buyout from Inner City Broadcasting Corporation.

He is currently a general manager for Kaya-Iloilo. Borromeo was a long-time captain of the Philippines national team. Previously a goalkeeper, he became a utility player, playing as a central midfielder or center forward for his club and mainly as a central defender for the national team. Club career Borromeo joined Kaya in 1999, and has been the captain of the first team for several years during his tenure. He went on a loan to Global during the 2010–11 season and led the club to be the champions of the 2010 UFL Cup during that season. On October 15, 2011, in his first match for Kaya in the 2011 UFL Cup against Diliman, Borromeo incurred an ACL injury, which sidelined him for the club and the national team. After almost seven months, he made his return for the 2012 League season on May 12, 2012 as a substitute against Loyola Meralco Sparks, which ended a 2–2 draw. In the following match against Global F.C. on May 16, 2012, he scored an equalizer in second half injury time to end in a 1–1 draw. He was dropped in the Kaya lineup for the 2012–13 season due to a meniscus injury, in which he acquired while training for the national team in mid-2012. Borromeo's recurring injury since 2011 made him consider retirement but eventually recovered to return playing with Kaya. He played for Kaya at the 2016 AFC Cup and was a starter and captain for the team's first match against Hong Kong sides, Kitchee. He was still playing for Kaya when the club joined the Philippines Football League in 2017 as Kaya–Makati (and later as Kaya–Iloilo). His return stint to Kaya as a player was brief but he remained with the club after he was appointed as its team manager. International career Borromeo first represented the Philippines at under-19 level during the 2000 AFC Youth Championship qualifiers and was also a goalkeeper at that time. Four years later, Borromeo would make his full international debut playing in all four matches in the 2004 Tiger Cup. This time he was playing as a striker and he assisted both goals by Emelio Caligdong, to give the Philippines their first ever win in the competition, defeating Timor-Leste 2–1. He has also represented the Philippines at under-23 level. He captained the Philippines under-23 team during the 2005 Southeast Asian Games on home soil and was converted to a central defender. He also scored in the 4–2 win against Cambodia. However, the Philippines failed to progress to the knockout stage. Personal Borromeo is the biological son of prominent Australian business man, Marcus Blackmore. He did not meet his father until he was 27.

Eleanor was firstly married in 1299 to , son of Narjot de Toucy and Lucia of Tripoli. Their marriage was dissolved on 17 January 1300 by Pope Boniface VIII because they were related and had not sought permission from the pope to marry. On 17 May 1302, Eleanor married secondly to Frederick III of Sicily. Her father and her new husband had been engaged in a war for ascendancy in the Mediterranean Sea and especially Sicily and the Mezzogiorno. The marriage was part of a diplomatic effort to establish peaceful relations which would lead to the Peace of Caltabellotta (19 August 1302). The peace divided the old Kingdom of Sicily into an island portion and a peninsular portion. The island, called the Kingdom of Trinacria, went to Frederick, who had been ruling it, and the Mezzogiorno, called the Kingdom of Sicily contemporaneously, but called the Kingdom of Naples by modern scholarship, went to Charles II, who had been ruling it. Thus, the peace was formal recognition of an uneasy status quo.

Suckling's appointment was not popular in the islands, which were at the time a notorious haunt for the lawless and for those seeking to evade their creditors elsewhere. He also served as a member of the 1st General Assembly of Nova Scotia from 1758 to 1759 and was the first Attorney General in Quebec, serving under James Murray from 1764 to 1766,A Directory of the Members of the Legislative Assembly of Nova Scotia, 1758-1958, Public Archives of Nova Scotia (1958) when he was removed from office. He was in Halifax in 1752, where he practised law and also was a merchant in partnership with William Nesbitt. In 1759, Suckling married Frances Duport, his second wife. In Quebec, he also served as advocate general for the Court of Vice-Admiralty. He left the province in 1771. Suckling's arrival in the Virgin Islands was successfully delayed by the Lieutenant Governor John Nugent, and Suckling did not, in the event, actually arrive in the Territory until January 1778. The machinations of the local population continued, and although the British Virgin Islands had been granted its own Legislative Assembly by the Governor of Leeward Islands by proclamation on 30 November 1773, and the Assembly first sat on 27 January 1774, it was not until ten years later, in 1783, that the Assembly would pass the Court Bill, forming a court in the Territory. Even then, Suckling was destined to be frustrated. Ultimately, he would leave the Territory on 2 May 1788 without ever taking up his appointment, and without ever having been paid, when his own funds run out. Suckling's brief time in the British Virgin Islands provides a valuable historical insight into the British Virgin Islands at this formative time in the Territory's history; his repeated letters both to the Governor-General in Antigua and to London provide some of the best records of what the islands were like at the time. Suckling, perhaps unsurprisingly, had remarkably little positive to say about the population over whom he was supposed to have sat in judgment.

It runs for over from Mundaring to Albany. The completed Munda Biddi Trail opened end-to-end in April 2013 when it claimed the title of the longest continuous off-road cycling trail of its kind in the world. Etymology The name Munda Biddi means \\"path through the forest\\" in the Noongar Aboriginal language, and it runs largely through an undeveloped natural corridor. The track traverses vast areas of unspoiled forests and bushland with mostly gentle terrain. While the track is open year-round riding conditions are better during spring and autumn, and potentially hazardous from December to March because of the often extreme heat and fire danger at that time of year. Record The record for completing the Munda Biddi Trail is three days, sixteen hours and 17 minutes, set by Callum Henderson in October 2020. Previously the record was held by Declan von Dietze for his ride in 2017 with a time of four days, six hours and 39 minutes. Sections of the trail vary in terms of their difficulty and terrain type but it has stages suitable for everyone's cycling ability and pace. The trail is easily accessible by car, and riders can begin their journey from multiple locations. There are free campsites at various points along the trail, some with more than a day's ride between them. Detailed maps of the trail are available. In April 2012, geocaches were placed throughout the Munda Biddi Trail. Foundation The trail is run by the Munda Biddi Trail Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation which was formed to assist the Department of Environment and Conservation and other land managers get the trail project off the ground. The foundation continues to be involved in trail development and planning, including managing volunteers, delivering events and trip planning, among other activities.

These are the arms of Wyndham of Orchard Wyndham differenced by a bordure wavy, for the illegitimacy of the 1st Baron Leconfield George Wyndham, 1st Baron Leconfield (5 June 1787 – 18 March 1869), was a British soldier and peer. A direct descendant of Sir John Wyndham, he was the eldest natural son of George O'Brien Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont, and Elizabeth Ilive. His parents were married in 1801 but had no sons after their marriage. George Wyndham entered the Royal Navy in 1799 as a midshipman in HMS Amelia. In 1802 he transferred to the Army as a Cornet in the 5th Dragoon Guards, promoted in 1803 to Lieutenant in the 3rd Dragoon Guards. In 1805 he was a Captain in the 72nd Highlanders and ADC to Sir Eyre Coote who was Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica. In 1807 he was DAAG to Earl Cathcart at the Bombardment of Copenhagen; in 1809, as Captain in the 1st Foot Guards, he took part in the Walcheren Expedition; in 1811 he was a Major in the 78th Regiment and the 12th Light Dragoons; and in 1812 he was Lieutenant-Colonel commanding the 20th Light Dragoons at the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo. The earldom of Egremont became extinct on the death of the 4th Earl of Egremont in 1845 and this George Wyndham was adopted as the heir to the substantial Egremont estates, including Petworth House in Sussex. In 1859 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Leconfield, of Leconfield in the East Riding of the County of York. During the Great Irish Famine, Col. George Wyndham was often in residence in his County Clare estate near Ennis where he assisted tenants who wanted to emigrate to Canada. This was a continuation of his father's improving policies in Sussex. In late 1849 and early 1850, a series of seven anonymous essays and illustrations concerning the famine appeared in the Illustrated London News under the title \\"Condition of Ireland: Illustrations of the New Poor Law.\\" Here the narrator (likely the journalist and philanthropist Sidney Godolphin Osborne) writes of Col. Wyndham that \\"Colonel Windham . . . is not tired of his fellow-creatures, and does not seek to exterminate them. Not a roofless house did I see here.\\" His property was a \\"little oasis of humanity in the desert of misery.\\" George Wyndham married Mary Fanny Blunt, daughter of Reverend William Blunt, in 1815. He died in March 1869, aged 81, and was succeeded in the barony by his eldest surviving son Henry. His third son, the Hon. Percy Scawen Wyndham, was the father of the politician and man of letters George Wyndham. His daughter, Hon. Caroline Sophia Wyndham (b. 12 Jul 1829, d. 19 Mar 1852) married Colonel Sir Robert Nigel Fitzhardinge Kingscote on 13 March 1851 at Petworth, Sussex. She died giving birth and is buried with her still-born child in the family vault at Bartons Lane Cemetery, Petworth, West Sussex.

Early life Zakir Husain was born on 2 November 1897 in Ghatchek, Rangunia, Chittagong. After his primary schooling in Rangunia, Chittagong, he was a student of Collegiate School, Chittagong. He graduated from Aligarh Muslim University. Career He was the first Indian Muslim to qualify for the Imperial Police Service of India in 1920. During his career in the police service, he served at various places in the erstwhile East Bengal. After the Second World War, at the time of partition of India in 1947, he was the Deputy Inspector General of Police of Presidency Range, Calcutta and ex-officio Shipping Master, Calcutta Port. He like many other Muslims opted for Pakistan, and was appointed the first Inspector General of Police of East Pakistan in August 1947. In 1952 he became the chairman of Federal Public Service Commission.  Later career  During the language movement in 1952 he was the Inspector General of Police, East Pakistan. After his retirement from Police Service in 1952, he was appointed the Chairman, Federal Public Service Commission of Pakistan for five years.

In 1958 he became the Governor of East Pakistan, and in 1961 appointed the central minister for Home & Kashmir Affairs of Pakistan. He returned to Chittagong in 1964, and retired from active politics. He initiated many important institutions during his working life. His first was the establishment of Faujdarhat Cadet College, and Colonel Gibson, who retired as Director General of the East Pakistan Rifles, was appointed the first Principal. Among others, he initiated the building of the 500-bed Chittagong Medical College Hospital, Chittagong University, Chittagong Women's College, Chittagong New Market, and the establishment of Rangunia College from a school. He also established Begum Iqbal Zakir Husain School, a Women's College in Rangunia now. Two major city roads have been named after him, Zakir Husain Road in Chittagong and in Dhaka.

He had three sons, Zahid, Adil and Shahid Husain and three daughters, Zehra[fateha], Zeenat and Farida. Death During the liberation struggle, on 9 April 1971 the Pakistan army attacked his home on a hilltop in Chittagong, killing most of his guards and servants. He and his eldest son Zahid Husain who was at that time with him, were lined up to be shot and were pushed down the hill when the commanding officer arrived and stopped them. The first floor of the house was destroyed by mortar attack, so he was taken in as the guest of Mr. M.M. Ispahani for a few days. He returned to his house after a while after some Bihari settlers who had in the meantime occupied it, were evicted. He could not bear the shock and soon after died peacefully on 24 May 1971, with all his children at his bedside. Curfew was lifted for a few hours so that his funeral could take place at the Laldighi Maidan in Chittagong. He was buried next to his second wife's grave, adjacent to Hazrat Graribullah Shah's Mazaar & Mosque in Chittagong.

He was a prisoner from 1946 to 1953 in forced labor camps in Siberia and Kolyma, where he survived as a result of his ability to sketch for the propaganda requirements of the authorities. He is remembered as one of few artists who has recorded the life of prisoners in the Gulag in the form of paintings.  Early life  Getman had a difficult childhood in Ukraine, often close to starvation, but from the very beginning was able to develop his natural artistic talents. After graduating from technical college in 1937, he attended the Kharkiv Art College in order to become a professional artist. Three years later he was called up to join the Red Army, where he served until the end of World War II. Shortly after his return, he was arrested for participating in anti-Soviet propaganda as a result of a caricature of Stalin one of his friends had drawn on a cigarette box. He was convicted in January 1946 and sent to the Gulag prison camps in Siberia.  The Gulag legacy  During the eight years Getman spent at Taishetlag (Siberia) and Svitlag (Kolyma), he started to develop his plan to record the horrors of the camp conditions in the form of paintings. While he could not paint openly in the camps, he took careful note of all that transpired. Even when he started to paint after his release in 1953, he still had to do so in secret as he would otherwise have been convicted once again, perhaps even sentenced to death. In his own words: \\"I undertook the task because I was convinced that it was my duty to leave behind a testimony to the fate of the millions of prisoners who died\\"The Jamestown Foundation, Nikolai Getman, The Gulag Collection: The Artist by Nikolai Getman . Retrieved 13 February 2007. The Heritage Foundation provides access to all 50 of Getman's paintings together with explanations of their significance.Getman Paintings: The Soviet GULAG Retrieved 25 December 2016. Their impact is especially effective in providing visual representations of the conduct of the camps, the harsh working conditions, the severe climate and the fate of the prisoners themselves. The Gulag paintings were not shown until 1993 at a private exhibition in the gallery of the Russian Artists' Union in Orel. In 1995, there was a special ceremony in the Turgenev Theatre in Orel where a Getman exhibition entitled \\"The Gulag in the Eyes of an Artist\\" was opened in the presence of the artist and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, author of The Gulag Archipelago. In June 1997, the private exhibition \\"The Gulag in the Eyes of an Artist\\" was displayed at the U.S. Congress in Washington, D.C.  Other artistic activities  In 1953, after his release, Getman worked as an artist in the House of Culture in Yagodnoe in Magadan Oblast. In 1956, he took part in an exhibition of the works of artists from Siberia and the Kolyma region and became a candidate for the USSR Union of Artists in 1957. In April 1963, he took part in the Second Congress of the USSR Artists' Union in Moscow, and in 1964 became a member of the USSR Artists' Union. He helped organize the Magadan Artists' Union and became director of the Magadan section of the Arts Foundation of the RSFSR from 1963 to 1966. In 1976, he moved from Magadan to Orel, where he had a studio in the local branch of the Russian Artists' Union. During this period he was also required to paint a number of portraits of political figures. He participated in several art exhibitions across the Soviet Union as well as in Germany, Bulgaria, Finland and The Netherlands.  The artist's plea  Getman is quite clear about his goal: \\"Some may say that the Gulag is a forgotten part of history and that we do not need to be reminded. But I have witnessed monstrous crimes. It is not too late to talk about them and reveal them. It is essential to do so. Some have expressed fear on seeing some of my paintings that I might end up in Kolyma again--this time for good. But the people must be reminded...of one of the harshest acts of political repression in the Soviet Union. My paintings may help achieve this.\\"The Gulag Collection: Paintings of the Soviet Penal System by Former Prisoner Nilolau Getman . Retrieved 13 February 2007.

The entire belt road is signed as the Kuhio Highway and Hawaii Route 56 was once signed on this route before it was downgraded to become Hawaii Route 560 in the late 1960s.How did Hawaii's route number system evolve into its present form? The Kuhio Highway is named after Jonah Kūhiō Kalaniana'ole, the second non-voting Congressional Delegate from territorial Hawaii. Route description Kuhio Highway ends its Route 56 designation in Princeville. The road drops in elevation heading towards the Hanalei River with lookout points giving views of the river valley and the northwestern shore of Kauai. It then goes through the only major town on this route Hanalei, and past the Hanalei Bay. It follows a foot trail used by ancient Hawaiians. An early record is given in the 1849 diary of William DeWitt Alexander, who lived at the Waioli mission which still can be seen along the road. William Tufts Brigham recorded boats used to cross the rivers in 1865. The Hanalei Pier is just north of the road on the bay. At one time the valley was home to rice fields, and the Haraguchi Rice Mill is one of several built along the river. The road is narrow at times and features eleven one-lane bridges with the first five constructed in 1912. County engineers J. H. Moragne and R. L. Garlinghouse supervised building the bridges and paving through the 20th century. Many of these bridges have restricted weight limits and some of them are wooden.HI 560 Bridge Log Traffic must yield at these bridges and it is custom to allow the greater traffic to cross first or after five to seven cars have passed your side of the road to allow to the other side to pass.One Lane Bridge Crossing the Hanalei River The road becomes narrower with each passing mile as the Nā Pali Coast begins to inch closer towards the coast. The road dead ends at Haena State Park. History There were plans to extend the road to Route 550 allowing one to circumnavigate the entire island in the 1960s; however, those plans were dropped due to environmental concerns and lack of traffic demand.Why can't you drive all the way around Kauai? The Hawaii Department of Transportation was planning to replace these bridges with two-lane bridges, but the plan was later abandoned in 1987. The area is popular for films, although they can cause traffic congestion since there are no alternate routes. Instead, a massive renovation project began for the Hanalei River bridge, promoted by a community preservation group with cooperation of the Hawaii Department of Transportation. A Pratt truss was built as a replica of the original 1912 one- lane structure. The new bridge was officially dedicated in November 2003. A 1960s structure under the roadway supports the heavier weight of modern traffic. Route 560 was added February 11, 2004 to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Hawaii as site 03001048.

The treaty followed the accession of Emperor Peter III, who admired the Prussian king Frederick the Great. It allowed the latter to concentrate on his other enemies, Austria and Saxony, in what became known as the \\"Miracle of the House of Brandenburg.\\" The treaty was signed on by Chancellor Vorontsov for Russia and for Prussia by its envoy, Baron . Russia pledged to assist in concluding peace among the individual participants in the Seven Years' War and to return to Prussia all lands occupied by Russian troops during the war. The intent to return the land was made known before the signing of the treaty; on February 23, Russia declared \\"that there ought to be Peace with this King of Prussia; that Her Tsarish Majesty, for their own part, is resolved on the thing; gives up East Prussia and the so-called conquests made; Russian participation in such a War has ceased.\\" Furthermore, it was agreed that Russia would help Prussia in negotiating a peace with Sweden. Frederick II (1712-1786) was so overjoyed, that he \\"ordered Te Deum and fêtes (festivals)\\" after the signing of the Treaty on May 5. His reason for rejoicing was well merited, \\"for the Tsar promised him assistance of a token force of 18,000 men\\" to be used against the Austrian army.

Dirham. al-Ja'd b.

Madelung, The Origins on the Controversy concerning the Creation of the Qur'ān p.505 in: Orientalia hispanica sive studia F.M. Pareja octogenario dicata, Leiden 1974 The name of Jahm b. Ṣafwān would later be ascribed - possibly spuriously - to the theological movement known as the Jahmiyya (see: Jahmites).W. Montgomery Watt, Encyclopedia of Islam II, q.v. Djahm b. Ṣafwān Jahm worked as the assistant to Al-Harith ibn Surayj during the latter's revolt against the Umayyad governor Nasr ibn Sayyar. Jahm was killed during the first attempt to take Merv in 746, though the revolt greatly weakened Umayyad power and indirectly contributed to the success of the Abbasid Revolution.G. R. Hawting, The First Dynasty of Islam: The Umayyad Caliphate AD 661-750, pg. 108. London: Routledge, 2002. Teachings Establishing the positive content of Jahm's doctrines is difficult, as they are reproduced (in an abbreviated form) only in later polemical works that are impossible to verify. However, it is said that he taught that only a few attributes can be predicated to God, such as creation, divine power and action, whilst others such as speech cannot. Therefore, he believed that it was wrong to talk about the eternal word of the Qur'an, since God (according to Jahm) is not a speaker in the first place.Clinton Bennett, The Bloomsbury Companion to Islamic Studies, p 126. Jahm was a proponent of extreme determinism, according to which a man acts only metaphorically in the same way in which the sun is said to set: according to Jahm, this is a linguistic convention rather than an accurate description, as it is actually God that makes the sun set.P. W. Pestman, Acta Orientalia Neerlandica: Proceedings of the Congress of the Dutch Oriental Society Held in Leiden on the Occasion of Its 50th Anniversary, 8–9 May 1970, p 85. Legacy Jahm's doctrines about God and His attributes were taken up in criticisms of the Mu'tazila, who were sometimes called Jahmites by their adversaries. The Mu'tazila believed that the Qur'ān was created, a tenet which agreed with Jahm's recorded view. Jahm left no writings, but many Muslim scholars wrote about his doctrines and a few modern scholars have written studies of him.Sources on the Jahmiyya are largely tendentious, as is the case with all heresiographies of the past. For modern studies see: Jamal al-Din al-Qasimi, Tarikh al-Jahmiyyah wa'l-Mu'tazilah, Yasir Qadhi, and Maqalat al-Jahm ibn Safwan wa Atharuah fi al-Firaq al-Islamiyya. Criticism Jahm bin Ṣafwān was heavily criticized by later scholars for his theological teachings. Many Hadith scholars wrote refutations of Jahm bin Ṣafwān's doctrines, particularly Ahmad ibn Hanbal, al-Bukhari, and al-Darimi.They wrote respectively: al-Radd 'alā al-Zanādiqah wa'l-Jahmiyyah, Khaql Af'āl al-'Ibād wa'l-Radd 'alā al- Jahmiyyah wa-Ashāb al-Ta'tîl and al-Radd 'alā'l-Jahmiyyah The latter also wrote a large refutation of a prominent Jahmite by the name of Bishr ibn Ghiyāth al-Mārisî wherein he declared him a Kafir (an unbeliever).Refer to: Naqd 'Uthmān b.

Animal Abolitionist Tagore Trajano was elected Animal Abolitionist Institute's president in 2010. For him, \\"the animal rights movement has helped to develop ambitious theories and challenge the Brazilian system. New authors have chosen this area to study and develop their research. This modest beginning has been helpful in furthering future debate. In the judiciary branch, the struggle has just begun\\". . According to Heron Santana, former president of the Animal Abolitionist Institute it is wrong of those who oppose animal abolitionism to imagine that this movement is against humanity. In fact, it refers to the extension of the moral sphere to include animals rather than threatening man exalting him. If we understand cruelty as the act of doing something bad, tormenting or damaging others through insensitive, inhumane, painful acts, all and any cruel practice to animals therefore offends rather than confirms the principle of human dignity. The social inefficacy of the principles and rules of article 225 of the Federal Constitution of Brazil occur because of the social obstacles that Lassalle called real factors of power, such as the animal's exploration industry and the psychological blocks putted by the speciesism's ideology, that has soldier, until the moment, that the legal factors transform into real factors of power. However it may be, it will be always possible to demand of the Third Power the compatibility of the inferior norms with the constitutional rules, because the real factors of the power come passing for significant changes, as the current environmental crisis and the recent scientific discovered have demonstrated. The environmental crisis and factors as the global warming, the water pollution by the animal's exploration industry, the increase of the illnesses because of the meat consumption associates to the abolitionism and vegetarian movements amplify around the world are an evidence that the real factors are modifying. A sign of progress of the issue in Brazil is the creation of the Animal Abolitionism Institute, occurred during the 1st Brazilian and Latin American Vegetarian Congress at Latin America Memorial. It's an institute that comes to addict to Brazilian Vegetarian Society in its efforts to abolish the animal slavery. Furthermore, it will help everybody that doesn't have legal support and philosophy's fundament in the elaboration of a process to defend the animal's interests. The importance of this institute, the first in Brazil, is pragmatic and, probably, we will still hear to talk about it so much. It's important to say that it has between his creators some of the biggest thinkers and exponents of this power in Brazil as Sônia Teresinha Felipe, Laerte Levai, Marly Winckler, Irvênia Prada, Edna Cardozo Dias, Luciano Rocha Santana and others. The institute launched the Brazilian Animal Law Journal, the pioneer journal in Latin American. The coordinators are Heron Gordilho, Luciano Santana and Tagore Trajano Even Peter Singer, that faithful to Jeremy's Bentham positivism, refused to talk about animal rights, currently defends the extension of the human rights for the great primates, under the argument that we already have enough evidences that they are part of our sort. As the Swiss vs Director of Biodiversity, Environmental and Hydrological Resource Department case has demonstrated, this can occur, as with slavery, without a constitutional amendment, therefore when article 225, §1º, VII of the Federal Constitution of Brazil ruled that the government and society must protect all animals, forbidden, in form of the law, practises that put in risk their ecological function, increase the extinction of species or submit them into cruel practises. Therefore, this norm must have an immediate effect.

Metropolitan Housing Development Corp, 429 U.S. 252 (1977), was a case heard by the Supreme Court of the United States dealing with a zoning ordinance that in a practical way barred families of various socio-economic, and ethno-racial backgrounds from residing in a neighborhood. The Court held that the ordinance was constitutional because there was no proof that \\"discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor in the Village's decision.\\". History A zoning ordinance in the Village of Arlington Heights, a Chicago suburb, barred the construction of multi-family housing facilities (such as apartment complexes) in the center of the neighborhood. The neighborhood was zoned for single-family dwellings without variance since 1959. Ruling Rather than applying a strict scrutiny test for a law that on its face is based on a suspect classification, the court applied a discriminatory intent test to determine whether the ordinance was actually based on a discriminatory intent which, in turn, would determine the constitutionality of the ordinance since the ordinance mentioned nothing about racial classifications. \\"When there is a proof that a discriminatory purpose has been a motivating factor in the decision, this judicial deference is no longer justified. Determining whether invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor demands a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available.\\" The Court stated that the challenging party has the burden of showing that 1) the official action affects a protected class in greater proportion than others, and if such is established, 2) that the official action was intended to discriminate against a suspect or protected class. Determining the intent of the official action can be difficult (outside of rare cases where racial discrimination is obvious on the face), and the court suggested that a fact intensive balancing test considering many factors including but not limited to: 1) the impact of the challenged decision (whether it disproportionately impacted one race); 2) the historical background of decisions under the official action, particularly if unequally applied in situations involving race; 3) the specific sequences of events leading up to the decision challenged in the case, including departures from normal procedures in making decisions and substantive departures, (i.e., if the decision maker would have made a different choice had the applicant been white, then race was the deciding factor); and 4) the legislative history where there are contemporary statements made by the governmental body who created the official action. =Causation= Footnote 21 introduces an idea of causation to these cases. Namely, it states that the petitioner must prove respondent had 1) an improper intent (i.e. that his intent was to discriminate against another race). After this is proven, the burden of proof shifts to the respondent, who must prove that 2) the improper intent did not actually affect the outcome of his decision. Thus, the court is saying that to satisfy this test, you must prove improper intent, a disparate impact, and causation in- fact (i.e. that the improper intent is the cause of the disparate impact). If causation in-fact cannot be proven, \\"there would be no justification for judicial interference with the challenged decision,\\" as \\"the complaining party in a case of this kind no longer fairly could attribute the injury complained of to improper consideration of a discriminatory purpose.\\" Holding In applying the aforementioned test, the court upheld the ordinance. Although it may have kept minorities and other economically challenged individuals from moving into the neighborhood, all multi-family housing existed on the neighborhood borders to commercial areas, whereas here the developer wanted to place the multifamily housing units in the center of the neighborhood. Additionally, the ordinance had been in place since 1959, and had been applied the same way, allowing only multifamily housing on the border without regard to price of rent, purchase, or governmental subsidy. Furthermore, there had never been any incidences of discriminatory procedural practices because the city council had allowed a variance to the developer in the past for the same type of low income, multi-family housing. Moreover, there had been no instances of substantive departures either because since 1959, each housing proposal for multi-family complexes had been required to be built bordering commercial areas.

The town lies on a local road nr. 984, running between Tarnów and Mielec and within the historic borders of Lesser Poland (not to be confused with the modern Subcarpathian Voivodeship, within whose boundaries it also lies). On January 31, 1581, King Stefan Batory allowed Mikołaj Firlej, the starosta of Biecz, to grant Magdeburg rights to the town of Radomyśl, located on the territory of villages Dulcza and Ruda. The area of Radomyśl had since the 14th century belonged to the Ligęza noble family (Półkozic coat of arms). After the wedding of Elzbieta Ligęza with Mikołaj Firlej, Radomyśl passed as a dowry into the hands of the Firlej family. In the late 16th century, the town had a parish church, which burned in 1646. New church was funded by the Firlejs, but it was not completed until 1740. Radomyśl also had a hospital and a parish school, and belonged to Lesser Poland’s Sandomierz Voivodeship. The town was burned and looted in the Swedish invasion of Poland, and it never recovered from the destruction of 1655–60. In the 18th century, first Jews settled here, and after the Partitions of Poland, Radomyśl found itself in the Austrian province of Galicia (1772–1918). In the mid-19th century, local peasants took part in the Galician slaughter, and during the January Uprising, residents of the town supported Polish rebels fighting in Russian-controlled Congress Poland. In the 19th century Radomyśl, located close to the Austrian - Russian border, further declined. Its population shrank, there was no industry and no prospects for the residents. The town burned several times, and the situation did not begin to slowly improve until the early 20th century. In 1907, the name of the town was changed to Radomyśl Wielki, to distinguish it from Radomyśl nad Sanem. In September 1914, Russian troops seized Radomyśl, and their occupation lasted until May 1915, when they were pushed back by the Austrians. In the Second Polish Republic, Radomyśl belonged to Kraków Voivodeship. The town was a local center of commerce, with several stores and businesses. Radomyśl did not take advantage of the Central Industrial Region (Poland) in the late 1930s. No factories were built here, nevertheless, many residents moved to Dębica and Mielec in search of work. In 1934 Radomyśl regained the town charter, which it had lost in 1919. During World War II, Germans murdered most of town’s Jewish residents. Radomyśl Wielki had its own, local Home Army unit, which in August 1944 took part in Operation Tempest. As a result of the war, the population of the town was reduced from app. 3,000 (in 1939), to 1,156 (1945). Since 90% of houses were destroyed during the war, Radomyśl does not have any historic buildings, except for the parish church. Also, in the market square there is the only existing prototype of PZL M-2, Polish trainer aircraft designed in PZL Mielec. People * Arthur Miller (1915–2005) – father born in Radomyśl.

Plural legal systems are particularly prevalent in former colonies, where the law of a former colonial authority may exist alongside more traditional legal systems (customary law).  History  When the systems developed, the idea was that certain issues (such as commercial transactions) would be covered by colonial law, and other issues (family and marriage) would be covered by traditional law. Over time, those distinctions tended to break down, and individuals would choose to bring their legal claims under the system that they thought would offer them the best advantage.  Current practice  Legal pluralism also occurs when different laws govern different groups within a country. For example, in India and Tanzania, there are special Islamic courts that address concerns in Muslim communities by following Islamic law principles. Secular courts deal with the issues of other communities. Since modern Western legal systems can also be pluralistic,See Griffiths, John (1986) \\"What is Legal Pluralism\\" in Journal of Legal Pluralism 24: 1-55. it is misleading to discuss legal pluralism only in relation to non-Western legal systems. Legal pluralism may even be found in settings that might initially appear legally homogenous. For example, there are dual ideologies of law within courthouses in the US, as the formal ideology of law as it is written exists alongside the informal ideology of law as it is used. The discussion on the internal and external plurality of legal systems is called sociology of law. Sources of Islamic law include the Koran, Sunnah and Ijma, but most modern Western nation-states take the basis of their legal system from the Christian superpowers of old (Britain, France etc.). That is also why moral laws found in the Bible have actually been made full- fledged laws, with the initial grundnorm set far back in legal history, hence fulfilling the priority of both the positivists and the naturalists. Hamed Kazemzadeh an orientalist believes that in spite of the levelling off of many present differences under the impact of science, technology, and increased intercommunication in Legal Pluralism, we cannot in any reasonably near future envisage any substantial lessening of the differences in our basic value systems, either philosophical or cultural. Legal pluralism also exists to an extent in societies where the legal systems of the indigenous population have been given some recognition. In Australia, for example, the Mabo decision gave recognition to native title and thus elements of traditional Aboriginal law. Elements of traditional aboriginal criminal law have also been recognised, especially in sentencing. That has, in effect, set up two parallel sentencing systems. Another example is the Philippines whose customary ways of indigenous peoples in the Cordilleras are recognized by the Philippine government and in Kalinga, Bodong is the means used by the people to settle disputes: since it had been very effective for them, it is still widely practiced. There is some concern that traditional legal systems and Muslim legal systems fail to promote women's rights. As a consequence, members of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) have called for a unification of legal systems within countries.

Geography Sokolow Malopolski lies in Sandomierz Basin, 24 kilometers north of Rzeszow, and 11 kilometers from Rzeszów–Jasionka Airport. History The history of Sokołów Małopolski starts with a forest settlement, located in once extensive Sandomierz Forest, which the sources describe as far as the 14th century. In 1569, Sokolow received a town charter, with a Renaissance street plan and a market square in the centre. In 1608, the town was looted by Stanislaw Stadnicki, a well-known troublemaker and the so-called “Devil of Łańcut”, but after this incident, Sokolow continued to prosper. In 1657, during the Swedish invasion of Poland, Sokolow was destroyed by Transilvanian army of George II Rakoczi. Following the first partition of Poland, Sokolow was in 1772 annexed by the Habsburg Empire, and remained in Austrian Galicia until late 1918. The town burned in fires in 1863 and 1904, and did not prosper. In the Second Polish Republic, Sokolow belonged to Lwow Voivodeship, and even though it was located in the Central Industrial Region, no plant was opened here, and the promised rail line was not built. In the 17th century, the town was protected by fortifications with five gates and moat. Sokolow has a 17th-century Jewish cemetery, and a parish church (1908–1916). Today, due to numerous wars and fires, there are only buildings from the 19th and 20th centuries. In 2010, local villagers helped to clean up the Jewish cemetery, though without the cooperation of local officials who reportedly said they didn't want to cooperate with Jews. At the time of the German invasion in September, 1939, Sokolow Malopolski's Jewish population was about 1600. The Germans immediately requisitioned Jews for forced labor. In April 1942, the Jewish population, then numbering 3000 because of refugees and others resettled by the Germans in Sokolow Malopolski, was forced into a ghetto. In July, German police shot 30 residents of the ghetto, resettled 200 in a labor camp in Glogow, and moved others to the Rzeszow ghetto where they were sent to the Belzec killing camp in July. Several dozens of Jews who hid from the deportations were murdered later in the year and in the summer of 1943, three Jews and the four Poles hiding them were shot and buried on the grounds of Sokolow Malapolski's elementary school. The number of the few Jewish survivors is unknown.  References   External links  *Official town webpage *Old Sokolow Malopolski photographs; taken about 24 years ago.

He currently lives and works in Berlin and Los Angeles, and teaches at the University of Fine Arts, Hamburg. Demand had his first solo exhibition at Tanit Galerie in Munich in 1992. In 2004 the Kunsthaus Bregenz mounted the first comprehensive presentation of Demand's major works from 1994 until 2004. Demand's work later was the subject of mid-career retrospectives at the Museum of Modern Art, New York in 2005 and at the Neue Nationalgalerie in 2009.

He thus describes himself not as a photographer, but as a conceptual artist for whom photography is an intrinsic part of his creative process.Lucy Davies (March 15, 2011), Thomas Demand: One I Made Earlier The Daily Telegraph. Having studied sculpture under Fritz Schwegler at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf alongside Katharina Fritsch and Thomas Schütte, Demand began his career as a sculptor.Collection: Thomas Demand Queensland Art Gallery. In 1993, he began to use photography to record his elaborate, life- sized paper-and-cardboard constructions of actually or formerly existing environments and interior spaces, and soon started to create constructions for the sole purpose of photographing them. The photograph he takes of this model with a large-format-camera is the final stage of his work, and it is only this image, most often executed in an edition of six, that is exhibited unframed behind Plexiglas, not the models. On the contrary, Demand destroys his “life- size environments” after he has photographed them. One notable exception is his large scale model for Grotto (2006), inspired by a postcard of a Mallorcan grotto Demand has never visited, which was later exhibited.Thomas Demand, October 21 – November 25, 2006 Regen Projects, Los Angeles. The life sized models are highly detailed, yet they retain subtle but deliberate flaws and anachronisms, such as an unnaturally uniform texture; according to art critic Michael Kimmelman, \\"the reconstructions were meant to be close to, but never perfectly, realistic so that the gap between truth and fiction would always subtly show\\".Michael Kimmelman (March 4, 2005), Painterly Photographs of a Slyly Handmade Reality New York Times. In The Dailies (2012), Demand for the first time experimented with the long-outmoded process of dye transfer, which involves fixing dyes with gelatine to ordinary paper. The practice was chosen by the artist for the saturated, but not garish colours, the spatial depth, the intense darkness, the durability and the extent to which the three primary colours can be modified, unlike ordinary prints. While the works' titles – Studio (1997), Zimmer (Room) (1996), Treppenhaus (Staircase) (1995) – are studiously devoid of superfluous information, the subjects represented in Demand's photographs often relate to pre-existing press images showing scenes of cultural or political relevance. The New York hotel room in which L. Ron Hubbard worked on Dianetics, for example, was the starting point for Zimmer (Room) (1996).\\"New Photography\\", 1997 Museum of Modern Art, New York. Zeichensaal (Drafting Room) (1996) is inspired by a photograph of the studio of Richard Vorhölzer, the architect who was in charge of much urban planning for postwar Germany; Scheune (Barn) (1997) is based on a Hans Namuth photograph of Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner in Pollock's East Hampton studio.;Roberta Smith (September 11, 1998), Art in Review: Thomas Demand at 303 Gallery New York Times. Studio (1997) derives from a photograph of the 1970s television set for the German \\"What's My Line?\\".

In 2011, Demand created Metzler-Saal (2011), his largest site- specific work to date. Commissioned by the Städel Museum, the photographic work appears as if the museum's main hall is lined floor to ceiling with deep purple curtains. Demand was inspired by the drapery depicted in many of the Städel's Old Master paintings.Javier Pes (October 15, 2011), Curtains up for Thomas Demand] The Art Newspaper. A result of a residency at the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles where he discovered the archive of architect John Lautner, Model Studies (2011) is the first time that Demand photographed architectural models that were not his own. The series comprises a total of 32 close-ups of cardboard, tar paper, and foam core panels, depicting the study models from many angles.Thomas Demand: Model Studies, 28 January 2012 - 15 April 2012 Nottingham Contemporary. Because Demand is working from models, the absence of people in his photographs is \\"conspicuous and thematic\\". The closest Demand has ever come to depicting people are the cut-out silhouettes of politicians and heads of state depicted in the picture frames arranged on Sir Edward Heath’s grand piano (Flügel/Grand Piano, 1993).Jörg Heiser, Pulp Fiction: Thomas Demand Frieze Magazine, Issue 73, March 2003. Furthermore, every trace of language has completely vanished: the papers strewn across the work table and floor in Büro (Office) (1995) have no text on them; the labels next to the doorbells that are the subject of Hinterhaus (2005) are variously colored but bear no names.Barry Schwabsky (October 21, 2009), A Makeshift World: On Thomas Demand The Nation. Demand cites Gerhard Richter and Ed Ruscha as sources of inspiration.Laura Barnett (April 25, 2011), Portrait of the artist: Thomas Demand The Guardian. =Films= Demand has also experimented with film in works such as Tunnel (1999), a tracking shot from a driver’s perspective through an empty tunnel lined by concrete pillars; the tunnel is modelled on the Paris underpass where Princess Diana died. Recorder (2002) is a 35 mm-film loop in which a paper model of an eight-track reel-to-reel recording device appears to play the Beach Boys album Smile (1966), a recording that was until recently lost;Thomas Demand Guggenheim Collection. the sound of a piano playing a variation on ‘Bicycle Rider’, an instrumental from the Smile sessions, can be heard on the soundtrack.

Showing an escalator without people, taken from surveillance footage, Demand here is referencing an escalator near Charing Cross Bridge in London where a gang was caught on surveillance camera shortly after they had robbed two men and thrown them into the Thames, killing one of them. Trick (2004) refers back to the beginnings of cinema and is based on one of the first films of the Lumière brothers, Assiettes tournantes (Turning Plates) of 1896.

Filmed over fifteen months with the help of a 12-person team of animators, the 100-second animated film Pacific Sun (2012) is based on a video of cruise ship Pacific SunThomas Demand's Pacific Sun, March 29, 2012 Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles. caught in a storm between the Republic of Vanuatu and Auckland, New Zealand which the artist found on YouTube, and follows the full narrative arc of the ship's violent encounter in the Tasman Sea. The film was made on a full scale set and, like Demand's models for his photographs, was completely constructed of paper and then destroyed. It comprises a total of 2,400 frames, filmed one at a time, as animators meticulously retraced the movements of each item in the ship's dining room, shifting the paper models of plates, lemons, pendant lamps, chairs, an upright piano, and a refrigerator by several millimeters at a time.Thomas Demand, May 5 - June 23, 2012 Matthew Marks Gallery, New York.

It is the administrative centre of Monze District.Google's list of schools in Monze, Zambia The town is named after Chief Monze, widely acknowledged as the spiritual leader of the Tonga people who inhabit the district. His palace is south of the town near a place called Gonde where a ceremony called Lwiindi takes place. This annual festival is a thanksgiving ceremony which attracts many people from around the country. Monze is a rapidly urbanising town with growth extending along the railway lines and T1 highway. The town is divided into neighbourhoods known locally as ‘compounds’. There is a substantial open-air market in Monze and a small but growing range of agri-dealerships, shops, bars and restaurants. The main industry in the district is agriculture, with maize being the most important crop. At one point in the past, the district used to produce more than 25% of the maize crop in Zambia. It was popularly known as the 'home of Zambia's granary'. Although its status as the leading maize producer has declined over the years, the most prominent feature in the town is still the Swedish built grain silos to the north of the town. Although these have been disused for a number of years. As with much of Southern Province, Monze has struggled with drought in recent years - crippling the agrarian economy and leading to significant food price increases. The town has a significant Seventh Day Adventist presence, although many other Christian denominations are represented. There is also a very small but growing Islamic minority in the town. Local Tourism sites of significance include: The Mooring Campsite, Family Safari (off the T1), the beautiful Magoye reservoir, and the derelict remnants of Fort Monze.

Johns had previously played Barlow in the Z-Cars, Softly, Softly and Softly, Softly: Taskforce series on BBC television during the 1960s and early 1970s. Barlow at Large began as a three- part self-contained spin-off from Softly, Softly: Taskforce in 1971 with Barlow co-opted by the Home Office to investigate police corruption in Wales. Johns left Softly, Softly for good in 1972, but returned for a further series of Barlow at Large in the following year, Barlow having gone on full-time secondment to the Home Office. This second series, rather than telling one story in serial form, as the 1971 series had, was instead ten 50-minute episodes, each with a self-contained story (this would be the format of all subsequent series). In this series, Barlow was supported by Norman Comer as Detective Sergeant Rees, who had been helpful to him during the first series. He also had to deal with the political machinations of the senior civil servant Fenton (Neil Stacy). In 1974 the series was renamed Barlow and a further two series of eight episodes each followed, introducing the character of Detective Inspector Tucker, played by Derek Newark. The final episode was transmitted in February 1975. The Barlow character was seen again in the series Second Verdict in which he, along with his former colleague John Watt (Frank Windsor), looked into unsolved cases and unsafe convictions from history. Episodes were 50 minutes in length and were filmed in colour: * Series 1: 15 Sept - 29 Sept 1971, 3 episodes * Series 2: 7 Feb - 11 Apr 1973, 10 episodes * Series 3: 23 Jan - 13 Mar 1974, 8 episodes * Series 4: 8 Jan - 26 Feb 1975, 8 episodes.

The students were separated into two groups, the academy grades and the elementary grades. Professor C.B. Hughes was principal for the entire student body, but devoted his time to the academy students. Mrs. Flora Williams and her daughter taught the elementary grades. For the first few years the salaries of the elementary teachers were paid by the state. Both groups of students were in the same building, occupying different rooms. The enrollment in the new school increased so rapidly that it was necessary to erect a new building to accommodate administrative and classroom facilities. The elementary grades were located in the new building. As the enrollment continued to grow, the academy grades needed more classrooms. To provide for this growth, the academy board authorized the construction of a separated building for the elementary grades. It was named the normal building, and was located on the north-east corner of the campus. Through the years the elementary department of the school at Keene continued to grow along with the academy and the college. In November 1949 after three years of investigating and planning, work was begun on a new building for the elementary. The new Demonstration School was built with a limited budget by student labor under the supervision of Ed E. Seamount, builder, and J. Randall Sloop, business manager of the college, for half of what it would have cost as a contracted job. The school later became known as Ella E. Hughes Elementary School of Southwestern Junior College. In 1966, the school would make one more move to its present location on pecan street and the name changed to Keene Adventist Elementary School. The school operates as a ministry of the Keene Seventh-day Adventist Church and provides Christian education for children grades Pre-Kinder through eighth grade. KAES as it is also called, offers music, technology, PE to round out a strong academic program. Governance The school is operated by a school board and is affiliated with the Keene Seventh-day Adventist Church. Athletic programs Keene Adventist Elementary School's athletic programs include Girls and Boys JH Basketball, JH Gymnastics, JH Soccer, JH Volleyball, Girls and Boys Elementary Basketball, Elementary Soccer, Elementary Volleyball, Elementary Gymnastics. Curriculum The schools curriculum consists primarily of the standard courses taught at Elementary Schools and college preparatory schools across the world. All students are required to take classes in the core areas of English, Basic Sciences, Mathematics, and Social Sciences. In addition, religion classes are mandated on a yearly basis. School Paper The school has a weekly news publication titled KONNECTIONS for the events on campus which include classroom & Athletics Newsletters, Calendars & Announcement's.

It classifies land into broad zones and reservations and is administered by the Western Australian Planning Commission. It is one of three regional schemes in Western Australia. The MRS is updated via an ongoing process of amendments. Amendments to the MRS are typically informed by a series of strategic plans prepared by the Department of Planning, Lands and Heritage. Detailed land use planning within the area of the MRS is undertaken by local governments and other statutory authorities which prepare one or more local planning schemes within their administrative boundaries. Local plannings schemes must be consistent with the MRS and require the approval of the WAPC. The acquisition of land reserved under the MRS is funded by a hypothecated land tax called the Metropolitan Region Improvement Tax.  Background  The MRS derived from Hepburn and Stephenson's 1955 Plan for the Metropolitan Region, Perth and Fremantle and has been in operation since 1963. Hepburn and Stephenson were commissioned by the Government of Western Australia to develop the plan in 1953. The completed report recommended that a regional planning authority be established for the purpose of implementing a regional planning scheme—a recommendation that was passed into law with the MRTPS Act of 1959. The Act centralised sub-division control, keeping it in the hands of the state government, but delegated many local planning responsibilities to local governments. Since 1963 the MRS has been continuously updated via a series of amendments which change the zoning or reservation of land to allow for a different land use. These amendments are typically informed by regional strategies prepared on a periodoic basis, commencing with the 1955 Plan, followed by the Corridor Plan in 1970, the Metroplan of 1990 and Directions 2031 in 2010. In 2006 the Planning and Development Act 2005 superseded the MRTPS Act 1959 and allowed for the creation of new region schemes outside the metropolitan area.  Metropolitan Region Improvement Tax  The MRTS is a special purpose tax recommended by Gordon Stephenson’s report, and introduced in 1959. The MRS is funded by a levy on taxable land value above $300,000 excluding primary residences. This tax is collected by the Department of Finance but falls wholly under the control of the WAPC. The tax funds the acquisition of land reserves under the scheme for public purposes including public open space, road and railway reserves and environmental conservation. One estimate calculates that MRTS has funded more than $1 billion of land acquisitions since 1963 (unadjusted for inflation).Acquiring land to achieve the plan (20 June 2013) Neil Foley.

A. R. Robb. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. 1999, p. 560. defined the boundaries between Russian America and British claims and possessions of the Pacific Coast, and the later Yukon and Arctic regions of North America. It was agreed that along the coast at the southern tip of Prince of Wales island (now known as parallel 54°40′ north) northward to the 56 parallel, with the island wholly belonging to Russia, then to 10 marine leagues inland going north to the 60th Parallel (later negotiations established the 60th parallel as the proper boundary), and then to the north of the 60th Parallel at the 141st line of longitude all the way to the \\"Frozen Ocean\\", the current Alaska/Canadian Yukon boundary, would be the boundary. The coastal limit had, the year before, been established as the limit of overlapping American claims in the parallel Russo-American Treaty of 1824. The Russian sphere in the region was later sold to the United States, eventually becoming the State of Alaska, while the British claim, along the coast to the south of parallel 54°40′ is now the coast of the Canadian province of British ColumbiaA Merged History of Canada and The United States, Bill Jones, ExploreNorth.com website, see section \\"1825: Anglo-Russian Convention\\"Chronology of Alaska and Yukon history, and for inland regions it defined the western limit of what became the modern day Canadian territory of Yukon. It also defined associated rights and obligations concerning waters and ports in the region. The treaty, in establishing a vague division of coastal Russian interests and inland British interests between 56 and 60 degrees north latitude, led to conflicting interpretations of the meaning of the treaty's wording which later manifested in the Alaska Boundary Dispute between the United States on the one hand, and Canada (with Britain acting, in foreign affairs, on behalf of Canada) on the other. Other terms of the treaty, including the right to navigation by British vessels to both commerce in the region affected, and also access to rivers crossing the designated coastal boundary, were exercised by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1834 but were met with opposition by then Russian-American Company Governor Wrangel in the form of warships and a blockade. This conflict, known as the Dryad affair,J. W. Shelest, The Dryad Affair: Corporate Warfare and Anglo-Russian Rivalry for the Alaskan Lisière, 1989. led to the RAC-HBC Agreement, in which the RAC agreed to lease the mainland coastal portion of the region south of Cape Spencer at the entrance to Cross Sound and the HBC promised to supply Russian America settlements with foodstuffs and manufactured goods. In addition the HBC waived its demand for payments for damages incurred during the Dryad affair.The Hudson's Bay Company, page 154 The same clauses enabled British access to the Stikine River goldfields in 1862 but were not assumed by the Americans upon their purchase of Russian interests in 1867, resulting in further conflict over British rights of access to the inland regions. The treaty's terms pertaining to the Arctic Ocean (referred to as the \\"Frozen Ocean\\" in the treaty) also played a part in the terms of the Bering Sea Arbitration and other decisions in Alaskan/US courts over marine and offshore interests.

The antiderivatives of certain elementary functions cannot themselves be expressed as elementary functions. A standard example of such a function is e^{-x^2}, whose antiderivative is (with a multiplier of a constant) the error function, familiar from statistics. Other examples include the functions \\\\frac{ \\\\sin ( x ) }{ x } and x^x . Liouville's theorem states that elementary antiderivatives, if they exist, must be in the same differential field as the function, plus possibly a finite number of logarithms.  Definitions  For any differential field F, there is a subfield : Con(F) = {f in F  Df = 0}, called the constants of F. Given two differential fields F and G, G is called a logarithmic extension of F if G is a simple transcendental extension of F (i.e. G = F(t) for some transcendental t) such that : Dt = Ds/s for some s in F. This has the form of a logarithmic derivative. Intuitively, one may think of t as the logarithm of some element s of F, in which case, this condition is analogous to the ordinary chain rule. However, F is not necessarily equipped with a unique logarithm; one might adjoin many \\"logarithm-like\\" extensions to F. Similarly, an exponential extension is a simple transcendental extension that satisfies : Dt = t Ds. With the above caveat in mind, this element may be thought of as an exponential of an element s of F. Finally, G is called an elementary differential extension of F if there is a finite chain of subfields from F to G where each extension in the chain is either algebraic, logarithmic, or exponential.  Basic theorem  Suppose F and G are differential fields, with Con(F) = Con(G), and that G is an elementary differential extension of F. Let a be in F, y in G, and suppose Dy = a (in words, suppose that G contains an antiderivative of a). Then there exist c1, ..., cn in Con(F), u1, ..., un, v in F such that :a = c_1\\\\frac{Du_1}{u_1}+\\\\dotsb+c_n\\\\frac{Du_n}{u_n} + Dv. In other words, the only functions that have \\"elementary antiderivatives\\" (i.e. antiderivatives living in, at worst, an elementary differential extension of F) are those with this form. Thus, on an intuitive level, the theorem states that the only elementary antiderivatives are the \\"simple\\" functions plus a finite number of logarithms of \\"simple\\" functions. A proof of Liouville's theorem can be found in section 12.4 of Geddes, et al.  Examples  As an example, the field C(x) of rational functions in a single variable has a derivation given by the standard derivative with respect to that variable. The constants of this field are just the complex numbers C. The function \\\\tfrac{1}{x} , which exists in C(x), does not have an antiderivative in C(x). Its antiderivatives ln x + C do, however, exist in the logarithmic extension C(x, ln x). Likewise, the function \\\\tfrac{1}{x^2+1} does not have an antiderivative in C(x). Its antiderivatives tan−1(x) + C do not seem to satisfy the requirements of the theorem, since they are not (apparently) sums of rational functions and logarithms of rational functions. However, a calculation with Euler's formula e^{i \\\\theta} = \\\\cos \\\\theta + i \\\\sin \\\\theta shows that in fact the antiderivatives can be written in the required manner (as logarithms of rational functions). : \\\\begin{align} e^{2i \\\\theta} & = \\\\frac{e^{i \\\\theta}}{e^{-i \\\\theta}} = \\\\frac{\\\\cos \\\\theta + i \\\\sin \\\\theta}{\\\\cos \\\\theta - i \\\\sin \\\\theta} = \\\\frac{1 + i \\\\tan \\\\theta}{1 - i \\\\tan \\\\theta} \\\\[8pt] \\\\theta & = \\\\frac{1}{2i} \\\\ln \\\\left( \\\\frac{1 + i \\\\tan \\\\theta}{1 - i \\\\tan \\\\theta} \\\\right) \\\\[8pt] \\\\tan^{-1} x & = \\\\frac{1}{2i} \\\\ln \\\\left( \\\\frac{1+ix}{1-ix} \\\\right) \\\\end{align}  Relationship with differential Galois theory  Liouville's theorem is sometimes presented as a theorem in differential Galois theory, but this is not strictly true. The theorem can be proved without any use of Galois theory. Furthermore, the Galois group of a simple antiderivative is either trivial (if no field extension is required to express it), or is simply the additive group of the constants (corresponding to the constant of integration). Thus, an antiderivative's differential Galois group does not encode enough information to determine if it can be expressed using elementary functions, the major condition of Liouville's theorem.

In a 19-page letter sent to Reid Schar, special counsel to the joint Senate and Assembly committee, Stepien's lawyer cited Stepien’s Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination, noting that in addition to the legislative probe, a federal criminal inquiry into the lane closures was also underway. Judge Jacobson of the New Jersey Superior Court ruled that Stepien was not required to comply with the legislative subpoenas to produce documents since they were written too broadly, and he was also protected under the Fifth Amendment. In May his lawyer also contended that a report produced on behalf of the Governor's Office misrepresented his client. In the trial in September 2016 about the lanes closures, federal prosecution witness David Wildstein said that Stepien was aware of the lane closures as they were happening.Mason, Melanie, \\"'Bridgegate' witness implicates top Trump staffer in plan to snarl traffic\\", Los Angeles Times, September 26, 2016.Racioppi, Dustin, \\"Bridgegate Trial: Former top Christie aide Stepien accused of knowing about lane closure plan\\", NorthJersey.com, September 26, 2016.

The text is addressed by the Hindu god Shiva to his consort Parvati. The text consists of five chapters, with the first chapter a treatise that summarizes nondual Vedanta (Advaita Vedanta) philosophy with influences from the Sri Vidya school of South India. The remaining chapters discuss yoga, the importance of a guru (teacher) to a student, various asanas, mudras and siddhis (powers) attainable with yoga and tantra. The Shiva Samhita is one of three major surviving classical treatises on hatha yoga, the other two being Gheranda Samhita and Hatha Yoga Pradipika. It is considered the most comprehensive treatise on hatha yoga, one that recommends that all householders practice and benefit from yoga. Over a dozen variant manuscripts of the text are known, and a critical edition of the text was published in 1999 by Kaivalya Dham Yoga Research Institute.  Date and location  Shiva Samhita has been dated by some scholars to be a 17th-century text, while others such as James Mallinson – a scholar of Sanskrit and Oriental Studies known for his Hatha Yoga publications, dates the text to be pre-1500 CE, probably between 1300 and 1500 CE. Based on statements contained within the text, Mallinson also believes that the Shiva Samhita was composed in or around Varanasi.  Content  Shiva Samhita declares itself to be a yoga text, but also refers to itself as a tantra in its five chapters. The first chapter starts with the statement, states Mallinson, that \\"there is one eternal true knowledge\\", then discusses various doctrines of self liberation (moksha) followed by asserting that Yoga is the highest path. The opening chapter largely presents the Advaita Vedanta philosophy, but in the Sri Vidya tantra format and style. The second chapter describes how the external observable macro-phenomenon are internalized and have equivalents within one's body, how the outside world is within in the form of nadis (rivers, channels), fire, jiva and others. The third chapter explains the importance of a guru (teacher, advisor), its various physiological theories including five elements that constitute the body, stages of yoga practice and a theory of asanas (postures). The fourth chapter presents mudras and states that yoga practice can lead to special siddhis (powers) and awakening of the kundalini (inner dormant energy). The fifth chapter is the longest of five chapters in the text. It discusses what prevents an individual's self-liberation, types of students, inner energies and sounds, a theory and description of chakras and mantras. The Shiva Samhita talks about the complex physiology, names 84 different asanas (only four of which are described in detail), describes five specific types of prana, and provides techniques to regulate them. It also deals with abstract yogic philosophy, mudras, tantric practices, and meditation. The text states that a householder can practice yoga and benefit from it. The Shiva Samhita is a yoga text. Included in it are asanas, such as Paschimottanasana (above).  Translations  Many English translations of Shiva Samhita have been made. The earliest known English translation is by Shri Chandra Vasu (1884, Lahore) in the series known as \\"The Sacred Books of the Hindus\\" The translation by Rai Bahadur and Srisa Chandra Vasu in 1914, also in the series known as \\"The Sacred Books of the Hindus\\", was the first translation to find a global audience. However, it omits certain sections (such as vajroli mudra) and is considered inaccurate by some. In 2007, James Mallinson made a new translation to address these issues. The new translation is based on the only available critical edition of the text — the one publIshed in 1999 by the Kaivalyadhama Health and Yoga Research Center.

Design and development The Pitcairn Mailwings were developed to carry air mail for the U.S. Postal Service. Of simple and robust construction, they had relatively benign flying characteristics. They were constructed using chrome-moly steel tube and square-section spruce spars with spruce and plywood built-up ribs. The fuselage was faired using wooden formers and covered with fabric. The tail sections were built up from steel tube and fabric-covered. The Pitcairn Mailwing had a ground-adjustable fin and in-flight adjustable tailplane. The undercarriage was of outrigger type with Oleo-Spring shock absorbers and disc brakes on the mainwheels. All versions looked very similar and changes were minor, with several fuselage extensions being the most obvious. The mail was carried in a fireproof metal-lined compartment forward of the pilot's cockpit. The Mailwings were flown extensively by the U.S. Air Mail service from 1927 until the end of dedicated Air-Mail routes. Pitcairn also built the same aircraft in sport versions for private use. These aircraft had the mail compartment removed, and a side-by-side two-seat cockpit was fitted.

Their practice, MacGibbon and Ross was established in 1872 and continued until 1914. They are best known today for their comprehensive published surveys of Scotland's architectural heritage. David MacGibbon should not be confused with architect William Forsyth McGibbon (1856-1923).Dictionary of Scottish Architects: William Forsyth McGibbon David MacGibbon The monument to David MacGibbon, Dean Cemetery David MacGibbon's grave in context, Dean Cemetery David MacGibbon LLD was born in Edinburgh, into a family of builders, and was educated at the Royal High School. He attended the University of Edinburgh from 1846–49, but did not graduate. In 1851 he joined the London office of architect William Burn, and made study tours to Europe during the 1850s. From 1856 he went into practice with his father Charles, drawing details for houses. By 1858 he had opened his own office in Edinburgh, later becoming architect to the Merchant Company of Edinburgh, involving work to the city's schools. He was the principal architect to the Royal Bank of Scotland from 1861 (succeeding David Rhind), designing bank branches for Dunfermline, Kilmarnock, Montrose, and many others. From 1862 he employed Thomas Ross as his assistant, making him a partner and establishing MacGibbon and Ross ten years later. In 1865 MacGibbon married Jessie Vannan Rintoul, and acquired the estate of Laggan, Ballantrae, from his father. After 1867 they built a new house on the estate (Gurphur, since demolished), and also purchased a house in the Dean Village area of Edinburgh. Later, a larger house was built at Ashfield in Grange Loan. These properties had to be sold in the early 1880s following the crash of the City of Glasgow Bank, to avoid the bankruptcy of MacGibbon's cousins. In 1880 he was elected president of the Edinburgh Architectural Association, and gave lectures on the architecture of Scottish castles and country houses. He had been making field visits and sketching for some years, building up a first- hand knowledge of the topic. It was these surveys and papers which formed the basis for the publication of The castellated and domestic architecture of Scotland. While on holiday in July 1884, MacGibbon's son William was killed and his daughter Rachel permanently injured when a sandbank collapsed on them. Rachel's lungs were affected and the family were forced to move to the French Riviera to aid her recovery. he continued sketching, publishing The Architecture of the Riviera in 1888. Returning to Scotland, he continued his surveys for the continuing publication of The castellated and domestic architecture of Scotland and The ecclesiastical architecture of Scotland. He began a parallel project on the continent with his son Alfred in the 1890s, although this never reached fruition. His workload brought on a heart condition which worsened over the next years. Although he published The Five Great Churches of Galloway in 1899, by that year he was too ill to attend the University of St Andrews to accept an honorary degree. In later life he was living with his family at 23 Learmonth Terrace, whilst his office (with Ross) was at 65 Frederick Street in Edinburgh's New Town.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1900-1901 He died in 1902, survived by his wife and son, and three daughters. He is buried in the north-west section of the northern (19th century) extension to Dean Cemetery in western Edinburgh. His grave is both very small and somewhat damaged. It has been moved back to rest against the much larger grave of his wife Jessie. Thomas Ross Thomas Ross was the son of a farmer, also Thomas Ross, and Ann Murray. He was born at Wardheads, Errol, and attended local schools before going to Glasgow around 1855 to work as an assistant to architect Alexander Kirkland. He soon moved to the office of Charles Wilson, winning a measured drawing competition during his time there. He spent the proceeds on a study trip to Yorkshire, visiting Fountains Abbey among other sites. In 1862 he began as an assistant to David MacGibbon in Edinburgh, and was made a partner in the firm of MacGibbon and Ross in 1872. Soon after this he married Mary MacLaren. Ross began sketching the architecture of Scotland along with his senior partner, contributing to the latter's public lectures, and culminating in the pair's major publications. After MacGibbon's removal to the continent, Ross managed the practice alone, and also continued to make sketching trips for their ongoing publications. The books brought in many commissions for restoration work, but many schemes were never realised, and business declined generally. After MacGibbon's death in 1902, his place was taken by his son Alfred. Ross himself was appointed as a founder commissioner of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland in 1908, and was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Edinburgh in 1910. He gave the Rhind lectures in 1899, on Scottish architecture. Fred MacGibbon was later appointed architect to the RCAHMS, but was diagnosed as diabetic and resigned in 1914, dissolving the practice. He died the following year. Ross continued alone until 1916, when he retired to his home in Saxe-Coburg Place, Edinburgh, occasionally undertaking small commissions. He was arrested in 1915 for sketching in a prohibited area, while studying Rossend Castle in Fife, and fined five shillings. In 1918 he was elected to the Royal Scottish Academy as Professor of Antiquities. He died three years after his wife, at the age of 91, and was survived by his son James MacLaren Ross, also an architect, and two daughters. He is buried in Comely Bank Cemetery in north Edinburgh.

Peru v Chile (also called the Chilean–Peruvian maritime dispute) is a public international law case concerning a territorial dispute between the South American republics of Peru and Chile over the sovereignty of an area at sea in the Pacific Ocean approximately in size. Peru contended that its maritime boundary delimitation with Chile was not fixed, but Chile claimed that it holds no outstanding border issues with Peru. On January 16, 2008, Peru brought forth the case to the International Court of Justice at The Hague, the Netherlands, which accepted the case and formally filed it as the Case concerning maritime delimitation between the Republic of Peru and the Republic of Chile - Perú v. Chile. The dispute primarily concerned an area at sea between the parallel that crosses the end point of the land border between Chile and Peru, and the bisecting line perpendicular to the coasts of Chile and Peru. This line was formed by the overlapping of the baselines of both countries, forming a trapezoid of . Peru requested an equitable division of the maritime territory, but Chile demanded sovereignty over approximately of the territory. On a secondary level, the dispute included the status of a maritime triangle to the left of the aforementioned trapezoid, approximately in size, which Chile considered part of the high seas and Peru as part of its maritime domain. Facts The background of this dispute goes back to the mid-1980s. In 1985, the then Foreign Minister of Peru, Allan Wagner first addressed this issue formally with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Chile at the time, Jaime del Valle. The following year, the Peruvian Ambassador Juan Miguel Bakula Patino had an interview with Foreign Minister Jaime del Valle on this matter, and handled a diplomatic note, dated May 23 of 1986. By the aforementioned note, issued by the Embassy of Peru in Santiago de Chile, Peru stated its position regarding the necessity of \\"concluding a treaty on maritime boundaries\\", on the premise that it must reach a formal and definitive delimitation of maritime spaces, which complement the geographical proximity between Peru and Chile. In ICJ proceedings Chile disputes that these meeting was ever about Peru wanting a maritime boundary treaty, in the contrary Chile argued that Peru recognized the Treaties signed in 1950's and that meetings had a totally different basis. Chile ratified the Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1997 and, according to its text, in September 2000, deposited it with the United Nations. Its nautical charts indicated the parallel 18º21'00\\" South as the maritime boundary between the two countries. The constitution of Peru prevents its government to ratify the sea convention however its Peruvian Government formalized its position on the issue, through a note sent to the United Nations on January 7, 2001, which does not recognize the line of latitude as the maritime boundary between the two countries. Public discussion on this subject was revived in 2005, when the Congress of Peru began to process a bill on determining the baseline of maritime domain, which are sequences of points that determine where it finishes the coastal edge and therefore begins the territorial sea as such, setting the width of the maritime domain of Peru to the distance of 200 nautical miles, using a line bisector in the south, bordering with Chile. The Peruvian law was passed and promulgated on November 3, 2005. On January 16, 2008, the government of Peru introduced in the International Court of Justice the \\"Case Concerning Maritime Delimitation between the Republic of Peru and the Republic of Chile\\", also called Peru v. Chile. The case is meant to adjudicate the re-delimitation of the maritime border between these two countries. In the case, Peru, whose legal team included jurist Juan Vicente Ugarte del Pino, argued that the maritime boundary has never been defined by a treaty and should run on a southwestern direction from their land border, perpendicular to the natural slope of the South American coast in an equidistant angle from both coastlines. Chile claims that in trilateral treaties signed together with Peru and Ecuador in 1952 and 1954, it is clearly stated that a maritime boundary (written as \\"límite marítimo\\" in Spanish) runs in a western direction, parallel to the equator.http://www.gob.cl/media/2012/12/Intervenci%C3%B3n-N%C2%BA4.pdfBBC News, Chile-Peru spat over sea border. Retrieved on January 27, 2007. The Chilean agent to the Court is former Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Alberto van Klaveren. The Peruvian agent is the current Ambassador to The Netherlands, Allan Wagner. Judgment The maritime boundary between Chile and Peru as defined by the International Court of Justice on 27 January 2014. On January 27, 2014, in the final ruling of the Court, Peru gained some maritime territory. The maritime boundary extends only to 80 nautical miles off of the coast. From that point, the new border runs in a southwest direction to a point that is 200 miles equidistant from the coast of the two countries. Under the ruling, Chile lost control over part of its formerly claimed maritime territory and gives additional maritime territory to Peru. From the 27 January 2014 court press release: The Court concludes that the maritime boundary between the Parties starts at the intersection of the parallel of latitude passing through Boundary Marker No. 1 with the low-water line, and extends for 80 nautical miles along that parallel of latitude to Point A. From this point, the maritime boundary runs along the equidistance line to Point B, and then along the 200-nautical-mile limit measured from the Chilean baselines to Point C. In view of the circumstances of the case, the Court has defined the course of the maritime boundary between the Parties without determining the precise geographical co-ordinates.* Significance Physicist Frank Duarte has been a consistent and early critic of the Chilean Government's handling of this dispute. In particular, he has sharply criticized President Sebastián Piñera's performance (deemed as favoring commercial interests over the interest of the Chilean people) and called for Chile's withdrawal from The Hague, early in 2012.El Voluntario, February 8, 2012 http://www.elvoluntario.com/index20120229.shtml Following the ruling, several political figures in Chile, of various political parties, have also called for Chile's withdrawal from The Hague that would, in addition, imply a withdrawal from the Pact of Bogota. Senators and members of parliament advocating this position include Ivan Moreira,La Segunda, January 27, 2014 http://www.lasegunda.com/Noticias/Politica/2014/01/910056/fuertes-criticas-de- parlamentarios-aqui-chile-no-ha-ganado-nada-hemos-perdido Jorge Tarud, Jaime Orpis,La Estrella de Arica, January 27, 2014 http://www.estrellaarica.cl/impresa/2014/01/27/full/4/ and Fulvio Rossi.

Attractions  Pottersville is home to the largest marble cave entrance in the eastern United States, Natural Stone Bridge and Caves Park. Though the formations are over a billion years old, the caves have only been open to the public since the late 1700s. (“Natural Stone Bridge and Caves”. Web.) Along with aforementioned attractions, Pottersville is in close proximity of multiple lakes. The town is just 23 miles from the popular tourist site, Lake George, 4.5 miles from a smaller lake, Loon Lake, .5 miles from Schroon Lake, and 10 miles from Friends Lake. These locations make it easy for tourists to participate in water related activities during the warmer months and partake in winter activities during the long winter months. (adirondack.net. Web.)

The town is 1,268 feet above sea level with the national average of 1,443 feet. (“Sperling’s Best Places”. Web.) Pottersville is subject to cooler, more temperate weather due to its location in Adirondack State Park. The Adirondacks (or ADKs for short) are in northern New York. The lakes in the area greatly contribute to the humidity in the summer months (late May through August), thus contributing to the rapid and unforeseen change in weather and large quantities of precipitation the area gets in relation to the national average. The Adirondacks see a clear distinction between seasons, but the cold weather months last the longest. Snow typically begins to fall in late October and continues until the later days of April/early May. Though winters in the Adirondacks are already harsh and can easily reach down into the negative degrees, the windchill can make the temperature feel 10 or more degrees colder. Blizzards are also an ongoing threat in the region. Despite the long winter season, it is estimated that the sun shines 60 to 70 percent of daylight hours during the summer months. The summer months are also some of the rainiest of the year. (“Climate of the Adirondacks”. Web.)  History  Pottersville was founded on March 25, 1799 as a part of the Town of Chester, Warren County. The town was mainly agricultural; most families owned livestock, such as sheep, for access to clothing material. Carding mills and tanneries were eventually built as the first forms of manufacturing outside of the home. In 1805, roads connecting Town of Chester were opened and are in the same spots today. Production in the Town of Chester in the year 1845 included 50,036 pounds of butter, 11,990 pounds of cheese, 31,176 bushels of potatoes and 20,372 yards of cloth. These statistics prove the Town of Chester to be a mostly-agricultural society in the 19th century. Travelers would often stop in at the Wells House (built in 1845 by Joseph Hotchkiss) which offered memorable hospitality as a hotel. The Wells House offered fish dinners caught on Schroon Lake and venison from the surrounding forests. The hotel was frequented by “Summer Folks” from areas such as Albany, New York, and Glens Falls, New York. An old Pottersville event was the “Pottersville Fair” which was started in 1877 by a family by the name of Faxton. The fair went bankrupt after a few years due to gambling and drinking issues, but was held once again in 1910 by the “Pottersville Fair Association”. Some of the festivities of the 1913 Pottersville Fair included watching 400 automobiles parade through the streets, along with an Ox race, music, a dog and pony show, and a contortionist, with an audience of about 7,000 people.  Places of Worship  A few of the Churches established in Town of Chester are the Community United Methodist Church in Chestertown, the Episcopal Church/Sonrise Lutheran Church in Pottersville, and the North Creek Seventh Day Adventist Church.

The first semiconductor roadmap, published by the SIA in 1993. It outlined the predicted progress of the semiconductor industry over the following 15 years. About The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) positions itself as the voice of the U.S. semiconductor industry. This is one of America's top export industries and a driver of American economic strength, national security and global competitiveness. Founded in 1977 by five microelectronics pioneers Wilfred Corrigan of Fairchild Semiconductor, Robert Noyce of Intel Corporation, Jerry Sanders of Advanced Micro Devices, Charles Sporck of National Semiconductor Corporation and John Welty of Motorola, SIA unites companies that account for 80 percent of America’s semiconductor production. Through this coalition, SIA seeks to strengthen US leadership of semiconductor design and manufacturing by working with Congress, the Administration and other key industry stakeholders to encourage policies and regulations that fuel innovation, propel business and drive international competition. Goals The SIA maintains that a robust semiconductor industry is the only way to ensure that America remains the global technology leader, and works towards this goal through outreach to members of Congress, their staff, executive branch officials, foreign governments, member companies and trade associations. Semiconductors – microchips that control all modern electronics – have a major impact on modern life. They enable the technologies that people use to work, communicate, travel, entertain, harness energy, treat illness and make new scientific discoveries. * The semiconductor industry directly employs a quarter of a million people in the U.S. and supports more than one million additional American jobs. * In 2012, U.S. semiconductor companies generated $146 billion in sales and semiconductors make the global trillion dollar electronics industry possible. * U.S. semiconductor companies represent over half the worldwide market. * Semiconductors are one of America’s largest exports.

Usually this involves the consumption of one course at each location. Involving travel, it is a variant on a potluck dinner and is sometimes known as a round-robin. An alternative is to have each course at a different dining area within a single large establishment. In a safari supper, the destination of the next course is generally unknown by the participants, and they have to decipher a clue before moving on. In the USA, participants go to each house for the various courses. Often there is a regional theme for each dinner, such as Italian, German, or French. Various wines to suit the courses are often served at each location. A challenge is keeping the food warm and ready at each location. An alternative is to have the courses at different restaurants. This style of eating has recently become popular as a charity fundraiser in rural Britain and is seen as a good way of meeting different neighbors in the community by virtue of each participant having separate guests.

It was decisive in securing control of the island of Kyūshū for the Northern Imperial Court, which was closely connected to the Ashikaga shogunate. Prelude Early in 1336, a number of Kyūshū clans, anticipating the movements of the shōgun's army against them, made efforts to unite and present a formidable resistance. A number of skirmishes were fought against clans loyal to the shōgun on the island, including a siege of Dazaifu, in which the Shōni clan stronghold was taken. Shōni Sadatsune fled, but was defeated soon afterwards, and committed suicide along with a number of his retainers. Shōgun Ashikaga Takauji, arriving in Munakata, a short distance away, at this time in early April, learned of the siege of Dazaifu and the death of Shōni Sadatsune. Gathering forces, he marched from Munakata on April 15, and journeyed to Tatarahama, fifteen miles (24 km) away, where he met the Kikuchi clan army. This army included Aso, Mihara, and Kuroki, all under the command of Kikuchi Taketoshi. Battle The military chronicle Baishō-ron describes Tatarahama as \\"a stretch of over three miles (5 km) of dry foreshore, crossed at the south end by a small stream. The precincts of the Hakozaki Hachiman Shrine consist of some five square miles of pine forest. To the south lies the city of Hakata, on the east five or six miles distant is hilly country, and to the west is the open sea stretching as far as China.\\" By the end of the battle, the Kikuchi clan forces had been chased by Ashikaga Tadayoshi to Dazaifu, at which point they fled into the hills. The Aso and Akizuki clan commanders committed suicide, and other commanders simply surrendered. Takauji rewarded his commanders for their bravery and service, but offered pardon to his opponents, and to several clans not participating in the battle, who thus joined him in its aftermath. Kyūshū thus became united under the shogunate, and the Northern Imperial Court.

Many people had to leave the village during World War II as the military used the area for artillery training, but the village expanded substantially in the 1950s, when the Forestry Commission, now defunct, began tree plantations and built about 25 houses, a school, a village hall and a shop for their employees.

He is remembered as the martyr of the Battle of San Mateo, where, in a heroic action, he blasted an enemy stronghold by immolating himself.Muerte de Ricaurte en San Mateo Early life Antonio Ricaurte was born into a family with a military tradition. He was the son of Esteban Ricaurte and María Clemencia Lozano, who was the daughter of Jorge Lozano de Peralta, Marquis of San Jorge, renowned collaborator of the Revolt of the Comuneros of 1781 against the rule of the Spanish Crown. He studied at the San Bartolomé School in Bogotá between 1799 and 1804, and later married Juana Martínez Camacho, niece of patriot Joaquín Camacho, who mentored him into the colonial bureaucracy and through whose influence Ricaurte was appointed chamber scribe and secretary of the Accounts Tribunal of the Viceroyalty of Nueva Granada.Antonio Ricaurte - Venezuela Tuya Early military career He participated in the revolutionary acts of July 20, 1810, in Bogotá, as a rebel against the colonial regime; for his bold performance, his comrades gave him the nickname El Chispero (\\"the spark lighter\\"). The commanders of the revolution entrusted him with the mission of keeping watch over the Viceroy Antonio Amat y Borbón at the Accounts Tribunal. When the patriot militias were organized, Ricaurte was incorporated to the infantry battalion of the National Guard, with the rank of lieutenant. During the first years of the United Provinces of New Granada, when a division between centralists and federalists occurred, Ricaurte supported Antonio Nariño and the centralists and fought on their side in the first civil war of New Granada. He fought the battle of Alto de la Virgen in Ventaquemada, where his troops were defeated on December 2, 1812. Subsequently, on January 9, 1813, he participated in the battle of San Victorino in Santafé, which gave the triumph to the centralists. War of Independence Statue of Antonio Ricaurte by sculptor Lorenzo González in San Mateo, Venezuela. This statue depicts Captain Ricaurte at the moment in which he immolates himself by lighting a barrel of gunpowder. It was erected at the site of the battle during the centenary celebration of the independence of Venezuela. In 1813 he was recruited in the army of New Granada under the then brigadier Simón Bolívar, to fight for the liberty of Venezuela, in what is known as the \\"Admirable Campaign.\\" In this first \\"Liberating Army,\\" he fought at the battles of La Grita (April 13), Carache (June 19), Niquitao (July 2), and Taguanes (July 31) among others. =Battle of San Mateo= In 1814 a series of battles between patriots and royalists took place in a region called Valles de Aragua (Valleys of Aragua), in what is now Venezuela. The main house of the San Mateo estate, property of Simón Bolívar, was placed under the custody of Ricaurte and a small troop of fifty soldiers. During the royalists' attack, the army under the royalists' Second Commander Francisco Tomás Morales took hold of most of the estate, including the main house, which was used as the principal ammunition depot. Realizing how the battle of San Mateo would be lost if the main house remained in the hands of the royalists, Captain Ricaurte ordered his men to leave and lit a barrel of gunpowder inside one of the ammunition storage facilities of the main house, thus killing himself and a large number of the royalist troops who were readily occupying the precincts. During the momentary disorder which followed the explosion, Bolívar seized the opportunity and launched an attack to regain control of the main house and later the whole of the estate.Antonio Ricaurte The Battle of San Mateo ended with the resounding triumph of the patriots' army. It was later estimated the royalists lost more than ten times as many soldiers as the patriots during the battle.La Batalla de San Mateo Legacy Antonio Ricaurte was a fervent freemason and to date the Lodge of Zulia State, Venezuela, is named in his honor. Ricaurte Municipality in Cojedes is named for him. Captain Ricaurte's heroic action is also remembered in the last verse of Colombia's National Anthem: References Further reading * FUNDACIÓN POLAR.

The EP is now out of print, having sold its last few copies during Summer 2007. Aled Phillips has stated that lyrically the EP is quite close to familiar grounds. In an interview about the EP, he has stated that primarily the concepts dealt with involve sex, drugs, betrayal, friendship, and small town life. Also specified is that single \\"Me Me Me\\" is about growing up in a narrow-minded, secular community that is a little too set in its ways; and the unspoken fear of progress; and taking to things that are deemed a little alien or foreign.

These characters were hugely popular with UK TV viewers at the time from their appearances on the long-running police series Z-Cars and its sequels Softly, Softly and Barlow at Large. The programme was presented partly as a discussion between the two principals in the present day, interspersed with dramatised-documentary scenes set in the 19th century. The series discusses suspects and conspiracies, but concludes there is insufficient evidence to determine who was Jack the Ripper. The experiment was seen to be a success, and the formula was repeated in 1976 with Second Verdict, in which Barlow and Watt cast their gaze over miscarriages of justice and unsolved mysteries from the past.

The film is directed by David L. Cunningham and stars Ian McShane, Alexander Ludwig, Frances Conroy, Gregory Smith, and Christopher Eccleston as the Rider. The Seeker is the first film to be produced by 20th Century Fox and Walden Media as part of their Fox-Walden partnership. On his 14th birthday Will Stanton (Ludwig) finds out that he is the last of a group of warriors – The Light – who have spent their lives fighting against evil – The Dark. Will travels through time to track down the signs that will enable him to confront the evil forces. The Dark is personified by The Rider (Eccleston). The film adaptation drew strong negative reaction from fans of the book serieshttp://ozandends.blogspot.com/2006/10/questions-about-dark-is-rising- movie.htmlhttp://chocnvodka.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2007/7/31/3130475.html for its disregard of the source material. Plot Will Stanton (Alexander Ludwig) is a day away from his fourteenth birthday. As the Stanton children walk home, Miss Greythorne (Frances Conroy), the local mistress of the Manor, and her butler Merriman Lyon (Ian McShane) invite the siblings to a Christmas party. Later, two farmers, Dawson (James Cosmo) and Old George (Jim Piddock), whom Will does not know, arrive at his house with a large Christmas tree ordered by the family. The farmers know Will’s name, wish him a happy birthday, and predict a storm despite the relatively clear sky. Will’s birthday is so close to Christmas that everyone in his large family ignores it except for his little sister Gwen (Emma Lockhart), who gives him his only birthday present (a Casio G-Shock Mudman wristwatch). The family has moved from the United States to a small English village and one of his brothers has arrived home for the holidays and displaces Will to the attic. For a Christmas present, Will buys Gwen an enigmatic stone pendant at the local mall. Two suspicious security guards accuse him of shoplifting and take him to their office. Alarmingly, as they question Will under the room's flickering lights, the guards metamorphose into rooks. They attack Will, but he manages to escape, accidentally using his powers for the first time. Will begins to experience more odd incidents and receives a strange and Celtic-looking belt from his oldest brother, Stephen (Jordan J. Dale). At the Manor Christmas party, Will once again sees Dawson and Old George who seem to know him well. Miss Greythorne and Merriman debate about when and how to approach Will about his destiny. Maggie Barnes (Amelia Warner), an attractive local girl appears at the party and Will becomes upset when one of his older brothers approaches her and begins chatting to her. Will leaves the Manor, and an ominous figure mounted on a white horse and accompanied by dogs chases Will. As the ominous figure prepares to kill Will, who is currently no match for him, Miss Greythorne, Merriman, Dawson, and Old George suddenly appear and save Will. Merriman names the threatening figure as The Rider (Christopher Eccleston), who warns them all that in five days' time his power – The Dark – will rise. The four adults are the last of the Old Ones – ancient warriors who serve The Light – and take Will on a walk through time and space to a place called the Great Hall, which in the present day is the church the Stantons attend. Will is the last of the Old Ones to have been born: he is the seventh son of a seventh son whose power begins to ascend on his fourteenth birthday, though Will disputes this idea because he believes he is the sixth son. Will is The Seeker: the sign-seeker who must locate six Signs whose possession will grant The Light power over The Dark. The Rider is also seeking them. Will returns home to his attic room and falls and twists his ankle. The doctor who calls is The Rider in disguise but he is recognized by Will. The Rider demonstrates his powers on Will’s ankle by alternately healing it and making it much worse before restoring it to its injured state; he offers Will the chance to have any desire he wants fulfilled in exchange for giving him the signs. Will discovers he has a lost twin brother named Tom, who, as a baby, mysteriously disappeared one night and was never found. Merriman instructs Will on his powers, which include sensing the Signs, summoning superhuman strength, commanding light and fire, telekinesis, stepping through time, and the unique knowledge to decipher an ancient text in the Book of Gramarye. Unfortunately, Will learns he can't fly, a power he wanted. Will returns to The Great Hall and learns the form each sign will take. Will reveals the first sign within Gwen’s pendant. As the sign-seeker, Will travels through time to find the next four signs. The Rider enlists a mysterious figure to help him get the signs from Will. When Will's brother invites Maggie to their home, she reveals some of her powers to Will. Will reveals his affections for her, saying he felt an instant connection with her. He tells her he has been thinking of her constantly. The Rider also tricks Will's older brother Max, using his magic to partially control him. The spell over Max is finally broken when Will uses his great strength to give Max a concussion. By the fifth day, The Dark that The Rider commands has now gained tremendous power and begins to attack the village with a terrible blizzard. Will locates the fifth sign but without the sixth sign, the Dark continues to rise. Maggie is revealed to be the mysterious witch helping the Rider in exchange for eternal youth. She is betrayed by him (for failing to get ANY of the signs) when she fails to get the fifth sign and ages rapidly, disintegrating into a flood of water while trying to steal them from Will. The Old Ones and Will seek sanctuary in the Great Hall, where the Rider cannot enter unless invited. However, The Rider's final trick (impersonating the voices of Will's mother and father, as well as Gwen) gains him access to The Great Hall. The Rider reveals that he has trapped Tom, whom The Rider mistook for The Seeker and kidnapped, within a glass sphere (and apparently took care of all these years). He sends Will into an evil dark cloud. As he enters, Will solves the riddle of the sixth sign: he himself is the sixth sign. With all six signs identified The Rider cannot touch nor harm Will. Using his power over the dark, Will banishes both The Rider – imprisoning the evil figure within one of his own glass spheres – and The Dark. The sphere disappears into the murky water. Will and Tom are reunited and return to their family, who are shocked to see Tom. Cast * Alexander Ludwig as Will Stanton.

Production =Development= In July 1997, Jim Henson Pictures optioned the rights for the film adaptation of Susan Cooper's novel The Dark Is Rising. The company attached Duncan Kenworthy as producer and Andrew Klavan as screenwriter, with the film's budget estimated to be $20 million. Brian Henson, president and CEO of the company, pursued the purchase of the rights because the book was one of his favorites. In May 2005, with production never becoming active under Henson Pictures, the film adaptation rights were purchased by Walden Media, who attached Marc E. Platt to produce the project. In August 2006, Walden Media announced a joint venture with the studio 20th Century Fox to distribute Walden projects through Fox channels. The next October, director David Cunningham was hired to helm the film, then titled The Dark Is Rising. Cunningham visited Romania to prepare production for an early 2007 start to target a September 28, 2007 release date. =Writing= The Seeker: The Dark Is Rising is very loosely based on the second book in Susan Cooper's series The Dark Is Rising Sequence, titled The Dark Is Rising. Walden Media hired screenwriter John Hodge in October 2005 to adapt the story for the big screen. The mythology of Cooper's book was considered to be the plot, and Hodge was tasked to interpret the book into events that could be portrayed in a film. The story, which took place in the 1960s and 1970s in the book, was rewritten to be contemporary. Vikings were included in the film, based on a reference in the book to an old Viking boat which the protagonist discovers. Hodge rewrote the protagonist Will Stanton, portrayed by Alexander Ludwig, to be 14 instead of 11. The screenwriter chose this age, considering 11 to be more of a child's age, and 14 to be an age of transition. Stanton was also written to be American so he would be established as more of an outsider, culturally alien to the story's English setting. Hodge also wrote new subplots for Ludwig's character in the film, including sibling conflicts, a crush on a young woman (Amelia Warner), and alienation at school. The script also features the inclusion of many action sequences. The character of The Walker, portrayed by Jonathan Jackson, was also rewritten as a younger person with a new story arc about the loss of his soul. However, Jackson's character was ultimately removed from the film's theatrical cut.Jonathan Jackson does not appear in the film's theatrical cut. Susan Cooper was reportedly not happy with the adaptation of her book.In a 2016 interview (Archived from the original), Cooper describes the above comment in this Wikipedia article as \\"a considerable understatement\\". =Filming= Filming began on February 26, 2007 in Romania. The film was shot on several soundstages at MediaPro Studios in Buftea, Romania. Several sets built at the soundstages included an English village, the Stanton family's country home, a medieval church, and a mysterious ruin known as the Great Hall. Cinematographer Joel Ransom chose to have such sets, including the reconstruction of the 13th-century chapel that took four months to construct, built to surround the actors so he could use 360-degree camera sweeps in the locations to represent time travel sequences. Director David Cunningham chose to minimize the use of visual effects in The Seeker, only creating around 200 visual effects for the film. Instead, the director pursued practical means to carry out the effects of the film's scenes. A thousand snakes were shipped in from the Czech Republic to be dumped on the actors, real water was used to wipe out a mansion in the film, and real birds were trained to fly at the actors. Cunningham also hired Viking reenactors to assist with the Viking element in the film. The crow-like birds are consistent with the book's signature harbingers of the Dark: the rooks. One visitor to the set said that the rooks were represented by \\"a half-dozen trained ravens.\\" Costume designer Vin Burnham designed a riding cloak for The Rider (Christopher Eccleston), a black get-up lined with real fur and feathers for an animalistic appearance. Burnham provided eccentric 1960s outfits for the character Miss Greythorne (Frances Conroy), with Celtic symbols incorporated into the outfits. The costume designer also wove small crystals into the outfits worn by Conroy and Ian McShane so that the outfits glisten on camera. Release Production on The Seeker began early in 2007 to target a September 28, 2007 release date. The release date was eventually moved a week later, to October 5, 2007 during Columbus Day weekend. Up until July 27, 2007, the film was titled and marketed only as The Dark Is Rising. Fox Walden changed the film title from The Dark Is Rising to The Seeker: The Dark Is Rising. Prior to its release, the film's title was finalized to be The Seeker in the United States market. In the Canadian market, the film was released simultaneously with the U.S. distribution but under the title The Seeker: The Dark is Rising. In the United Kingdom, the film was released under the title The Dark is Rising. The Seeker was reported to have issues leading to its release: author Susan Cooper was not happy with the adaptation of her book, the film's title was changed repeatedly, and advance screenings were canceled. =Home media= The Seeker was released on DVD on March 18, 2008. Region 4 and Region 2 DVDs contain 'Extended/Deleted Scenes' which include outtakes of Jonathan Jackson's scenes as the Walker. There are also two featurettes, and optional director's commentary on the extended/deleted scenes. The Region 1 DVDs lacked the extended/deleted scenes. Reception =Box office= The Seeker was released in the United States and Canada on October 5, 2007. The film grossed $3,745,315 in 3,141 theaters in its opening weekend, ranking No. 5 at the box office in the United States and Canada. The Seeker had one of the poorest starts for a fantasy film. Box Office Prophets questioned why the film was opened in so many venues, with the cost for prints in 3,141 theaters exceeding its opening weekend gross. , The Seeker has grossed $8.8 million, in the United States and Canada and $22.6 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $31.4 million. The Seeker had the second worst debut of all time for a film released in more than 3,000 theaters, placing behind Walden's 2006 comedy-adventure film Hoot. The Seeker then lost the most theaters in its third weekend, ahead of Hoot.Box Office Mojo: Biggest Theatre Drops (Most wide releases are contractually obliged to stay at a particular screen for two weeks and can be dropped by a theatre only at the beginning of the third week.) =Critical response= Critical reception to the film has been largely negative. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 14% based on reviews from 93 critics. The site's consensus states: \\"The magic of the book is lost in translation with The Seeker, due to its clumsy plot and lack of heart.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 38% based on reviews from 21 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". The only positive feedback from most critics went toward Christopher Eccleston's performance. The New York Posts Kyle Smith objected that, \\"Good and evil don't seem to be trying to destroy each other so much as come up with cool-looking effects to show off, as if they were competing in a 'Project Runway' for wizards... [and] given superpowers, Will does approximately nothing with them.\\"BAD HARRY DAY Gianni Truzzi of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer opined that the movie lacked the \\"grandiose elements\\" of \\"magic rooted in its ties to Arthurian legend and British folklore\\" that made the books so memorable. The Boston Globes Ty Burr panned the movie for not understanding its intended audience of book-readers, saying, \\"the producers have tried to gin up the story for multiplex audiences. They've succeeded in making a movie for no audience at all.\\"Hide from 'The Seeker' And The New York Times's Jeannette Catsoulis complained that \\"John Hodge's screenplay is frequently dreary and overly literal... The Seeker feels passé and lacks a charismatic lead.\\" One of the few somewhat-positive reviews came from the Chicago Tribunes Kelley L. Carter, who said that \\"At its best, The Seeker is a pretty vivid fantasy book come-to-life\\" and found the lead character of Will Stanton to have been \\"played convincingly.\\"Movie review:The Seeker: The Dark Is Rising Another came from the Baltimore Sun's Michael Sragow, who found that The Seeker had \\"a lot going for it, including wonderful sets and locations...that create a heightened-reality English hamlet\\".A fair tale of beating back the Dark> Both gave the movie only 2½ stars out of 4. Several of the reviewers mentioned the Harry Potter movies. The New York Times's Catsoulis mentioned, \\"Too bad Daniel Radcliffe is an only child.\\" The Chicago Tribune's Carter wrote, \\"Harry Potter, meet your not-so-much cousin... had it not been for the Potter series, the bar for children’s fantasy film wouldn't be quite as high, and The Seeker falls short of the high-riding, high-quality material delivered in the Harry Potter film series.\\" The New York Post's Smith went so far as to title his review \\"Bad Harry Day\\" and to joke that \\"In today's England, a teenage boy is instructed by grown-up mentors in the use of magical powers while a dark lord who comes in many formats promises an epic battle. The movie is based on a 1973 book by Susan Cooper, who must be trembling in fear of being sued for ripping off J.K. Rowling's ideas and publishing them 20 years in advance.\\" The Boston Globe's Burr described the parallels more clearly, saying that \\"against him is a metrosexual meanie called The Rider (Christopher Eccleston), sort of a He Who Can Be Named. In general, Cooper's story line has been Potterized to little avail: Will's family is as large as the Weasleys, as unloving as the Dursleys, and no fun whatsoever.\\" Soundtrack * \\"The Sweetest Disguise\\" – Performed by The Sunday Drivers * \\"Jingle Bells\\" – Performed by The CSSR State Philharmonic * \\"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\\" – Performed by The CSSR State Philharmonic * \\"Deck the Halls\\" – Performed by Nicolaus Esterházy Sinfonia * \\"Joy to the World\\" – Lyrics by Issac Watts, music attrib.

It is owned by GCap Media and was part of the national Classic Gold Digital Network. It broadcasts on 1152 kHz AM, DAB digital radio, as well as online and on Sky Digital Channel 0189 (the latter two were the national versions of Classic Gold, lacking the local elements). Based at Earl's Acre, Plymouth, its sister station is Heart Plymouth, formerly known as Plymouth Sound until 2009. History Plymouth Gold was launched on 19 May 1975, as Plymouth Sound, broadcasting on 97.0 FM and 261 metres medium wave (1152 AM). It was one of the earliest ILR's to launch in the UK and was the first commercial radio station for the West Country. Towards the end of the 1980s/ early 1990s, as with most other ILRs Plymouth Sound split into two stations; the FM frequency remained as Plymouth Sound and the AM service became Plymouth Sound AM. After being owned (either fully or partly) by the GWR Group, the Capital Group and The Local Radio Company, throughout the 1990s, the station was fully bought by the GWR Group around 2000. On 7 February 2000 Plymouth Sound AM was re-branded Classic Gold 1152 (Plymouth). Due to ownership rules the GWR Group had to sell off all of their Classic Gold stations. They were sold to the UBC Media Group, although the GWR Group did keep a 20% stake in the brand. The 20% stake was increased to 100% in 2007 and GCap assumed full control of both Capital Gold and the Classic Gold Digital Network, merging the two networks, and renaming it simply Gold on 3 August. Present day Plymouth Gold until recently, had around 20 hours a day of networked programming. Only the weekday drivetime show was local and was presented by Peter Greig. Network shows still have local adverts, information and news aired at selected intervals. The station plays the best songs from the 1960s to today (although songs from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s do predominate).

Over time the space has been the meeting point for intellectuals, artists, writers and free-thinkers, weathering financial difficulties and becoming a tourist attraction, as much as another coffee-shop. History A Brasileira in 1911, photo by Joshua Benoliel. During the middle of the 19th century, the Hotel Borges is founded along the Travessa de Estevão Galhardo, in the proximity of the Hotel Universal (in the old Barcelinhos Palace, later the Chiado warehouses). The space is successively operated within the upper floors of the building, while a shop (operated by Ramiro Leão) functioned on the main floor. In 1868, Elie Bénard inaugurated a small bakery along Rua Garret at no. 104-106, while the Grande Hotel Borges continues to operate under its proprietor António Borges Areias (by 1883). The A Brasileira was opened by Adriano Telles on 19 November 1905 at No.122 (an old shirt shop), to sell \\"genuine Brazilian coffee\\" from the State of Minas Gerais, a product generally unappreciated in homes of Lisboetas of that period. In order to promote his product, Telles offered each shopper, who bought a kilogram of ground coffee (for 720 réis), a free cup of coffee. It was the first shop to sell the \\"bica\\", a small cup of strong coffee, similar to espresso. The founder, who lived in Brazil and imported his products, had no problem in importing coffee, goiabada, tapioca, spices, tea, flour, in addition to wine and olive oils. In 1907 the owner of A Brasileira opened a similar establishment in Braga, the Café A Brasileira (Braga). In 1908, the Brasileira was remodelled by Manuel Joaquim Norte Júnior (1878-1962) in order to provide a café, and again in 1922, to re-orient the business model in order to sell drinks, in addition to coffee. Its redesign, completed by architect José Pacheco, was completed in the Art Deco-style, with a green and gold entrance, and an interior that included mirrored walls, brass fittings, a long, oak bar and wooden booths. With the establishment of the First Portuguese Republic (5 October 1910), its associated liberties, and the installation of the Directório in the Largo de São Carlos (then renamed Largo do Directório)The Directorate was located on the main floor where Fernando Pessoa was born. the Brasileira became a heavily transited café. It was during the nascent Republic that numerous intellectuals, artists and literary writers began to walk through its doors. United by the poet-General Henrique Rosa (the adoptive uncle of Fernando Pessoa), many of the literary figures would help to establish the magazine Orpheu. Between 1950-1960 the Brasileira was in risk of closing permanently. By 1993, the café had weathered its mid-century financial problems, and had applied for funds from the Lisboa 94 Capital Europeia da Cultura program to remodel and restore the building. Architecture Exterior façade of A Brasileira, with ornamental door and boilerplate The always active counter of A Brasileira during mid-afternoon A bronze statue of Fernando Pessoa sits permanently outside =Exterior= The building is a narrow, two-floor rectangular plan (main floor and basement), with a front façade that includes the establishment name A Brasileira and respective address number. The narrow façade with a differentiated decoration, includes many polychromatic elements: an arched cement façade with inlaid windows; with two reclined figures on either end of the curves; a geometric, cornice-like entranceway with three separate double-doors (the central access being the largest), fronting onto Rua Garrett; and ornate handles and fixtures. Below the boilerplate, in relief, is the figure of a man taking a coffee, surrounded by curvilinear flourishments. =Interior= The long narrow hall includes mosaicked floors in alternating marble tiles (in black and white), a roof with ornamental friezes and square pillars along the walls, also decorated in sculpted wood. The room itself is painted in ochres, golds and reds, with brass fixtures intermingling with sculpted red woods. Between the pillars are mirrors, while at the far end of the café is a clock encased in a wooden decoration. The counter, is located on the right wall of the entranceway, while a staircase provides access to the kitchen located in the basement. Culture It was a favored haunt of intellectuals and academics, including Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa, the writers Aquilino Ribeiro and Alfredo Pimenta. Fernando Pessoa would regularly enjoy absinthe and a sweet bica, while he continuously smoked, read or wrote. Over its storied history and because of the initiative of José Pacheco, the walls of the Brasileira collected prominent paintings from artists. In 1925, the Brasileira began to exhibit the paintings of the new generation of Portuguese painters, that frequented the café: José de Almada Negreiros, António Soares, Eduardo Viana, Jorge Barradas, Bernardo Marques, José Pacheko and Stuart Carvalhais.Paul Buck, p.81 These works were eventually sold to one buyer in 1969. This \\"museum\\" was renovated in 1971, with new paintings from painters of the epoch: António Palolo, Carlos Calvet, Eduardo Nery, Fernando Azevedo, João Hogan, João Vieira, Joaquim Rodrigo, Manuel Baptista, Nikias Skapinakis, Noronha da Costa and Vespeira. A bronze statue of Fernando Pessoa, by sculptor Lagoa Henriques, was eventually placed outside the café in 1988, even though Pessoa considered the Café Martinho da Arcada (on the Praça do Comércio (founded in 1782), as his favorite café. The University of Lisbon's Faculdade de Belas-Artes () is located within the Chiado district, and its approximately 1300 students transit the quarter regularly, competing with tourists for open-air tables.

The first piece that Christie wrote for the stage, it launched a successful second career for her as a playwright. Twenty-two years after Christie's death, Black Coffee was re- published in the United Kingdom and the United States in the form of a novel. The novelisation was undertaken by the Australian-born writer and classical music critic Charles Osborne, with the endorsement of the Christie estate.  Writing and production  Agatha Christie began writing Black Coffee in 1929, feeling disappointed with the portrayal of Hercule Poirot in the previous year's play Alibi, and being equally dissatisfied with the motion-picture adaptations of her short story The Coming of Mr. Quin and her novel The Secret Adversary as The Passing of Mr. Quin and Die Abenteurer GmbH.Morgan, Janet. Agatha Christie, A Biography. (Page 177) Collins, 1984 According to the foreword to the current HarperCollins edition of Black Coffee in its novelised form, she finished writing the play in late 1929. She mentions Black Coffee in her 1977 life story, Autobiography, describing it as \\"a conventional spy thriller ... full of cliches, it was, I think, not at all bad\\".Christie, Agatha. An Autobiography. (Pages 433 -434). Collins, 1977. Nonetheless, her literary agents had advised her to forget the play entirely and she was willing to do so until a friend connected with the theatre suggested that it might be worth producing. Christie's autobiography claimed that the debut performance of Black Coffee took place at the Everyman Theatre in Hampstead. However, no record exists of such a staging and she was undoubtedly confusing it with the true opening production at the Embassy Theatre in Swiss Cottage (now London's Central School of Speech and Drama) on 8 December 1930.Agatha Christie – Official Centenary Celebration (Page 78). 1990. Belgrave Publishing Ltd. . The production ran in that theatre only until 20 December. On 9 April 1931 it re-opened at the St Martin's Theatre (later to be the second home of Christie's most enduring stage work The Mousetrap), where it ran until 1 May before transferring to the Wimbledon Theatre on 4 May. It then went to the Little Theatre on 11 May, finally closing there on 13 June 1931. Poirot was played initially by the well-known character actor Francis L. Sullivan who became a good friend of the author. She approved of his portrayal despite the fact that physically he was far too tall for the dapper little Belgian detective. (Sullivan stood six feet, two inches in height.)Book and Magazine Collector. Issue 174. September 1998 Also in the premiere cast was (Sir) Donald Wolfit, playing Dr. Carelli. Wolfit would become renowned in England as an actor-manager, best remembered for his vivid interpretations of Shakespearean roles and other big-scale classical parts. Unlike most other Christie plays, Black Coffee did not transfer to the New York stage.Haining, Peter. Agatha Christie – Murder in Four Acts (Page 26). 1990. Virgin Books. . Synopsis of scenes The scene is laid in the library at Abbot's Cleve, Sir Claud Amory's house, about 25 miles from London. ACT I *8.30pm ACT II *The following morning ACT III *Fifteen minutes later Plot Hercule Poirot and his friend Arthur Hastings are summoned to visit a famous physicist, Sir Claud Amory, but they discover on their arrival that he has been murdered. The plot revolves around a stolen formula, with Poirot deducing which of Sir Claud's house guests/family members is the killer. Reception The Times reviewed the work in its issue of 9 December 1930, saying that, \\"Mrs Christie steers her play with much dexterity; yet there are times when it is perilously near the doldrums. Always it is saved by Hercule Poirot, the great French [sic] detective, who theorizes with the gusto of a man for whom the visible world hardly exists. He carries us with him, for he does not take himself too seriously, and he salts his shrewdness with wit. For a ruthless investigator he is an arrant sentimentalist; but that is one of the ways in which Mrs Christie prevents her problem from becoming tedious. Mr Sullivan is obviously very happy in the part, and his contribution to the evening's entertainment is a considerable one. Mr Boxer Watsonizes pleasantly, and Miss Joyce Bland, as a young lady who must wait until the very end before knowing a moment's happiness, contrives to excite our sympathy for her distress. The remainder of the cast is rather serviceable than exciting.The Times December 9, 1930 (Page 12)\\" The Observer's issue of 14 December 1930 contained a review by \\"HH\\" in which he concluded that, \\"Miss Agatha Christie is a competent craftsman, and her play, which is methodically planned and well carried out and played, agreeably entertains.\\"The Observer 14 December 1930 (Page 18) The Guardian reviewed the play in its issue of 10 April 1931. The reviewer stated that, \\"Miss Christie knows the ropes, keeps to the track, sets her Herculean protector in defence of innocence, and unmasks the real villain at eleven o’clock. One must be something of a ritualist to find enchantment in such matters. Mr. Francis Sullivan makes a large, guttural, amiable sleuth of the sagacious Hercules . He is wise not to imitate Mr. Charles Laughton who gave us such a brilliant study of the Belgian some time ago. He makes his own portrait and does it with a competent hand.\\" The reviewer praised others in the cast by name and concluded, \\"the company conduct themselves with a proper sense of the ceremonial involved in a detective play. But it is surely permissible to be surprised that adult people can be found in fairly large numbers to sit undismayed through the execution of such ritual as this.\\"The Guardian 10 April 1931 (Page 11) Two days later, Ivor Brown reviewed this second production in The Observer when he said that, \\"If you are one of those playgoers who are eternally excited by a corpse in the library and cross- examination of the family, all is well. If not, not. To me the progress of detection seemed rather heavy going, but I start with some antipathy to murdered scientists and their coveted formulae. Black coffee is supposed to be a strong stimulant and powerful enemy of sleep. I found the title optimistic. \\"The Observer 12 April 1931 (Page 15) The Times reviewed the play again when it opened at the Little Theatre in its issue of 13 May 1931. This time it said that, \\"Its false scents are made for the triumph of the omniscient Belgian detective, complete according to the best tradition with unintelligent foil; and if they appear sometimes to be manufactured with a little too much determination and to be revived when they seem most likely to be dissipated, they may be allowed because they just succeed in maintaining our sympathy with distressed beauty and our interest in the solution of a problem. Though much of the dialogue is stilted, the complacent detective has an engaging manner.The Times May 13, 1931 (Page 13)\\" Credits of London production Director: André van Gyseghem Cast of December 1930 production:Official Centenary Celebration (Page 78) Francis L.

It was republished with minor revisions by Samuel French Ltd on 1 July 1952. This followed a successful revival in repertory. Like The Unexpected Guest (1999) and Spider's Web, the script of the play was turned into a novel by Charles Osborne. The novelisation was copyrighted in 1997 and published in 1998. Black Coffee's resurrection as a novel was not its first significant reworking, however. It had been adapted into a motion picture, also entitled Black Coffee, way back in 1931. Running to 78 minutes, the motion picture was produced by Julius S. Hagan and released on 19 August 1931 by Twickenham Film Studios. Austin Trevor played the role of Poirot in the motion picture. A few months earlier, he had played the same character in a screen version of the Alibi, made by the same film studio. (Alibi was an adaptation of Christie's classic whodunnit, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.) In 1932, the play was filmed again, this time by Les Établissements Jacques Haïk in France. Opening in cinemas as Le Coffret de laque on 15 July 1932, it was the first non-English language treatment of a Christie work. It was released internationally as The Lackered Box.

The name originates from Assassins Company, a US Army armor unit (Alpha Company - radio call sign \\"Assassins\\" - 4th Battalion, 64th Armor Regt., 2nd Brigade, 3D Infantry Division, which combined with combat engineer and infantry companies to form Task Force 464 in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.) In the taking of Baghdad on April 7, 2003, Assassins Company led the assault on the government center and palace district that later became the Green Zone. On April 8, the unit repelled a significant pre-dawn counterattack through Assassins' Gate, by the Jumhuriyah Bridge. As many as 60 Iraqi soldiers and fedayeen fighters are reported to have been killed in about four hours of fighting. Several of the American tankers up in their hatches were wounded by fire coming down from surrounding buildings before A-10 Warthogs and F-18s were called in to destroy the buildings and work over a bunker complex in the adjacent park. Around mid- morning, while searching for a suspected Iraqi forward artillery observer whose radio transmissions were being monitored, one of the tanks fired at the Hotel Palestine from the Jumhuriyah Bridge, killing two European journalists the tank commander said he believed were enemy observers. This prompted accusations by media groups of purposeful targeting of journalists. A Spanish judge brought murder charges against the tank commander, the company commander and the battalion commander. A US military investigation cleared the soldiers of any intentional wrongdoing. Assassins Company provided security at the gate for several months after the invasion, at one point facing a hostile crowd at the barricade, with the order given to fix bayonets, while at least one soldier was stabbed and wounded by someone in the crowd, according to soldiers who were present. The name Assassins' Gate does not have any Iraqi origin. It is described as \\"a sandstone arch.\\" This gate was also the site of a devastating attack from a vehicle-borne improvised explosive that left a 3-foot deep crater early one morning on January 18, 2004.

The route was extended northeastward to Rouses Point by 1931, then truncated to the hamlet of Chazy in the early 1960s. NY 348 ceased to exist entirely in 1980, at which time its former routing became County Route 24 (CR 24).  Route description  NY 348 began at an intersection with NY 22 and West Church Street in the hamlet of West Chazy (within the town of Chazy), located east of Flat Rock State Forest. NY 348 proceeded east along East Church Street, crossing over tracks once used by the Delaware and Hudson Railroad, reaching a junction with CR 25 (Stratton Hill Road). At this junction, NY 348 turned northeast along Fiske Road, crossing over the Little Chazy River and nearby Bayington Brook. Bending further northeast through the town of Chazy, the route paralleled the Delaware and Hudson until reaching a crossing with the Adirondack Northway (I-87). NY 348 and the Northway did not connect, as NY 348 crossed under the four lane expressway, crossing the alignment of a railroad spur and soon reached the hamlet of Chazy. In Chazy, the route crossed over the Little Chazy River once again then intersected with US 9\\\\. This junction with US 9 marked the northern terminus of NY 348.  History  The alignment that would become NY 348 between the hamlet of West Chazy and the town of Chazy was taken over by the state of New York and improved to state highway standards in 1907-1908\\\\. The alignment was wide and to be constructed with stones approved by the state with sand and limestone filler. The state engineer estimated that the improvement of the road would cost $58,250 (1907 USD), and a contract was let on September 19, 1907 to Jeremiah T. Finch, who commenced work on the new roadway in October of that year. The work was completed 11 months later (September 1908) at the cost of $54,111.94. NY 348 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. At the time, it began at NY 22 in West Chazy and ended at US 11 in the village of Champlain. NY 348 had an overlap with US 9 from Chazy to what is now NY 9B in the town of Champlain. Here, US 9 forked to the east and followed the length of modern NY 9B to Rouses Point. NY 348 was extended east to Rouses Point along US 11 and what is now NY 276 by the following year. In the mid-1940s, US 9 was rerouted to follow its modern alignment through Champlain, creating a lengthy overlap between NY 348 and US 9 from Chazy hamlet to Champlain village. The overlaps with both US 9 and US 11 were eliminated in the early 1960s after NY 348 was truncated on its northern end to its junction with US 9 in Chazy. NY 348 was removed from the state highway system in 1980. The designation officially ceased to exist on January 7, 1980, and ownership and maintenance of the route was transferred from the state of New York to Clinton County on April 1, 1980, as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. The former routing of NY 348 was redesignated as CR 24.

For most of the league's history, any play that did not advance the ball across the line of scrimmage also stopped the clock; this prevented teams from kneeling to run out the clock. (This rule was repealed in 2018.) It also rewards defensive play, as a tackle for loss automatically stops the clock. Any player injured during this time and that team uses a timeout.

Career John Wyndham was the son of Edward Wyndham, 5th Baron Leconfield, and Gladys Mary Farquhar, and a direct descendant of Sir John Wyndham. He was educated at Eton College and the University of Cambridge. He served as Private Secretary to Harold Macmillan in various appointments that the latter held between 1940 and 1945, then again in 1955 when Macmillan was Foreign Secretary, and finally during his time as Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963. He was also a Trustee of the Wallace Collection between 1953 and 1972. In 1963, four years prior to succeeding his father as Baron Leconfield, he was raised to the peerage in his own right in Macmillan's resignation honours as Baron Egremont of Petworth in the County of Sussex. This was a revival of the Egremont title held by his ancestors the Earls of Egremont.

He died of cancer in June 1972, aged 52, and was succeeded in the baronies by his eldest son Max. Macmillan wrote the entry on him for the Dictionary of National Biography and dedicated his War Diaries (1984) to him.

It is the highest municipality of the province of Valladolid, at more than 900 m over sea level. It belongs to the historical region of Castile, specifically Old Castile. History Ruins of Santa María de Oreja convent, built between the 11th and 12th centuries. Church of Santo Domingo de Guzmán. Altarpiece of the Santo Domingo of Guzmán church. There are several theories about the origin of Campaspero's name, a leading one being from the Spanish phrase \\"Rough Field,\\" which correctly describes the rocky terrain of the area. If it is like most of the villages of the Communidad de Villa y Tierra (Community of Town and Land) de Cuéllar, Campaspero was likely founded at the beginning of the 11th century, during the period of repopulation of the Valley of the Douro. This repopulation was directed by Don Pedro Ansúrez of Valladolid. From the earliest records until 1833, the Campaspero belonged to the province of Segovia. It was closely linked to the province of Valladolid because of the proximity to the Comunidad de Villa y Tierra de Peñafiel (Valladolid). In 1833, Campaspero was made a part of Valladolid province. Campaspero today Nowadays, Campaspero is the only town in Valladolid's province belonging to the Churrería, a region integrated by Segovian localities, with the sole exception of Campaspero. The parochial church of Guzmán's Santo Domingo is built on stone of its famous quarries. This building dates back to the 18th century, when it was decided to raise this temple due to the condition of ruin of the previous one, which is missing today. The church has a simple structure, and keeps within some carvings of notable interest, as that of the Ascension, made by Pedro Berrugete, a sculptor from the neighbour town of Peñafiel, in the second half of the 18th century. The images of Santo Domingo of Guzmán (the church's patron saint) and San Buenaventura were carved in the same century. They share the major altarpiece with that of the Ascension. They also share the Baroque style, and were carved in wood for Pedro Ventosa, an artist from Sepúlveda (Segovia). On the left of the presbytery stands out a sculpture of Christ Crucificado, built in the endings of the 16th century. It was surely carved in Cuéllar by Roque Muñoz. In the side of the Epistle an altarpiece of dressing shows an image of the Virgin of the Rosario. Quarries Campaspero sits on a seam of stone 30 meters thick, which the townspeople have used since they settled there. The stone of its quarries has long been an important source of work for the village. Many buildings of the province were built with Campaspero's stone, often the stones were also carved locally. The craftsmen of the town still make fronts, shields, pantheons and chimneys. As time goes by, the completely home-made work has given way to technology and industrial processes though, luckily, there still remain some craftsmen in the purest sense of the word. They work with their hands and simple tools that help them to make those pantheons, fronts and fountains. The stone-cutters of Campaspero have not forgotten their old skills and they work very hard when they are entrusted with any special order, as shields or restoration of ancient works of art. Gastronomy Ayuntamiento of Campaspero. In spite of the fact that the \\"Rough Field\\" is not ideal for farming, especially for the water shortage of this high and stony land, the tenacity of its inhabitants has managed to extract the scanty wealth of the soil. It has been enough for the sustenance of a good number of neighbors. The predominant animal husbandry is the wool one, whose \\"lechazos\\" have determined to a great extent Campaspero's gastronomy, where there can be tasted two of the tastiest specialities of lamb: the typical roast lechazo and the grill of chops. The town boasts the F. Soria candy factory, known for its puff-pastries, tea pastries, \\"lenguas de gato\\" (cat tongues). Their specialities also include Christmas sweets such as marzipan and \\"amarguillos.\\" Festivals The first celebration of the year to be held in Campaspero is Carnival, in which the \\"Quintos\\" are the main characters. While the \\"dulzainas\\" sound, the young lads ask for money in the village's streets.Santo Domingo Marathon in 2008. The most important day is Tuesday. The \\"Quintos\\" have chosen this day to celebrate the traditional cock races. The next celebration to be held is \\"Pentecostés\\". It takes place a Sunday at the end of may, and the people of the village make a procession with the \\"Virgen del Amor Hermoso\\" which is the centre of the celebration. The children of the village take part in games and sports competitions. The Patron of Campaspero is Santo Domingo of Guzmán, and the saint's day is August 8. After an important mass and a dance's procession, a soft drink is served by the council in the Main Square. The program is completed with bullfighting and running of bulls across the streets of Campaspero.

The film stars real- life brothers Prabhu Deva, Raju Sundaram and Nagendra Prasad in lead roles alongside Jyothika, while Deva composed the film's music. Based on the Marathi play All The Best, 123 released in June 2002 mixed to positive reviews. Plot Tirupathi (Prabhu Deva), Pazhani (Raju Sundaram) and Chidambaram (Nagendra Prasad) are physically impaired friends – Thirupathi is blind, Pazhani is deaf, and Chidambaram is mute. None of them has a family, and they begin to live under the same roof. Narmada (Jyothika) enters their lives, and all three fall in love with her. The story follows their attempts to win her hand.

Thimayya Production In December 2001, the three sons of prominent dance choreographer Sundaram were reported to be coming together to star in the Tamil film, and while Prabhu Deva was an established actor and Raju Sundaram had also appeared in films, it became the first substantial role for Nagendra Prasad. Karunas was selected to play a key role, while Sundaram was reported to be a choreographer in the film, which would be based on a Marathi play title All the Best. Sandeep Chowta was initially expected to be music director, but was later replaced by Deva. In Telugu, the film was adapted under Siddesh Films with Uttej signed on to reshoot scenes which had featured Karunas in the Tamil version. The dialogues were written by Thotapalli Madhu and lyrics were written by Ponduri, Bhavanachandra and Rohini Krishna as the film was dubbed and released with a few reshot scenes. The mouth freshener brand, Pass Pass, teamed up with the film to put product placement into the venture. The film was released in Kannada under the supervision of Sundeep Malani, with another regional actor Komal Kumar chosen to replace Karunas as the thief. Release The Tamil version of the film opened on 1 June 2002 to mixed reviews with a critic noting \\"Dilshad as the blind Tirupathy has done his role well but Raju Sundaram and Nagendra Prasad have to pick up the nuances of acting. Jyothika has very little to do. The comedy of Karnas is good. However, the highlight of the film are the dances and the choreography. The three brothers have tried to each other when it comes to dancing. Music by Deva is very average.\\" The Hindu noted \\"it is a tightrope walk for director K. Subhash because presenting physical impairment without hurting sentiments is not easy. And the director does come out unscathed. Much of it is situational humour and the dialogue, again by Subhash, accentuates the comic impact in some of the scenes.\\" The Telugu version of the film released on the same day. Jeevi of Idlebrain.com gave the film \\"two stars\\", stating \\"The only strength of the film is situation comedy based on the disabilities of three protagonists. Otherwise it's an avoidable film\\".

Notional is trained by Doug O'Neill for owner J. Paul Reddam, who also have three-year-olds Great Hunter and Liquidity in their stable. Racing at age two, Notional's best showing in a stakes race was a third in the 2006 Hollywood Prevue Stakes. In his three-year-old debut, Notional won January's Grade II San Rafael Stakes at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California by four lengths under jockey Corey Nakatani. Sent to the Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans, Louisiana in February, Notional scored a 2 length win in the Risen Star Stakes under jockey Robby Albarado in a race where favorite Circular Quay was seriously impeded as a result of a race accident. Notional came in a close second to Scat Daddy in the Florida Derby in his last prep before the Kentucky Derby. While he was set to run the Triple Crown races, Notional suffered a fracture of his front cannon bone during a workout at Keeneland three weeks before the running of the Kentucky Derby. He will undergo surgery for the injury which is not life-threatening, but there is question about whether he will be able to return to racing. He did not run in any of the Triple Crown races. Having an uneventful four-year-old season, Notional returned to form winning the July 5th, 2008 running of the Salvator Mile Handicap under Joe Bravo.

Life and education Iyayi was born in Ugbegun in Esanland, Edo State, Nigeria. His family lived on little means but instilled in him strong moral lessons about life. Iyayi started his education at Annunciation Catholic College (ACC) in the old Bendel State, finishing in 1966, in 1967 he went to Government College Ughelli, graduating in 1968. In that same year he was a zonal winner in a Kennedy Essay Competition organised by the United States Embassy in Nigeria. Iyayi left Nigeria to pursue his higher education, obtaining a M.Sc in Industrial Economics from the Kiev Institute of Economics, in the former USSR (now Ukraine), and then his Ph.D from the University of Bradford, England. In 1980, he went back to Benin and became a lecturer in the Department of Business Administration at the University of Benin. As a member of staff of the university, he became interested in radical social issues, and a few years after his employment, he became the president of the local branch of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), a radical union known for its upfront style on academic and social welfare. He rose to the position of president of the national organization in 1986, but in 1988, the union was briefly banned and Iyayi was detained. In that same year he won the Commonwealth Writers Prize for his novel Heroes. He was later removed from his faculty position by the Alele Williams administration and he got back his job after winning the court case against the school authority and the government with the help of human rights lawyer Femi Falana. Dr Festus Iyayi was one of the best lecturers at the Department of Business Administration, University of Benin. His students spanned from Undergraduates to Postgraduates. His interests included behavioural science in business, human resources management, key concepts such as work place alienation, Theory of needs, Work and task, Recruitment and Selection, different paradigms: radical, system, political etc. Dr Iyayi was a key resource person who delivered lectures in the University of Benin Business School (MBA), whose graduates can attest to the qualities of his lectures and supervisions. He would have been a year into his retirement if he had opted for early retirement but the unexpected happened. He died in a ghastly motor accident caused by a reckless convoy of the then Kogi State governor Idris Wada while on his way to Kano State to attend the National Executive Council meeting of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) concerning a four-month strike embarked upon by the union.Edegbe Odemwingie, Kuni Tyessi, Ugochukwu Iroka, Patrick Ochoga and Achor Abimaje, \\"Nigeria: Strike May Linger As...Governor's Convoy Kills Festus Iyayi\\", AllAfrica, 13 November 2013.

They were best known for developing and patenting the first flash drive, marketed in 1995 as DiskOnChip, and the first USB flash drive, marketed in 2000 as DiskOnKey. They also created the patented True Flash Filing System (TrueFFS) which presented the flash memory as a disk drive to the computer. After 17 years of business, they were acquired by their prior competitor, SanDisk, in 2006. The DiskOnChip (DOC) was developed at the R&D; Center established by M-Systems called EUROM. Rick Iorillo, Rony Levy and David Deitcher were the individuals that worked on the development and marketing of the first 2 MB DOC. This product went on to receive the Most Innovative Award from EDN in 1995 and later went on to become the Flash Drive and DiskOnKey.  DiskOnKey  DiskOnKey was a small Flash memory device encased in a plastic enclosure with an integrated flash controller that connected to the USB port on a computer. It required no separate power or device drivers from the computer if running Windows 2000, or Windows ME; it was a true plug and play device. In Windows 98 it required a driver which was supplied on a CD-ROM. The computer saw the device as a hard disk drive and it came in capacities of 8, 16, and 32 MB. It was marketed as a hard disk on a keychain. It had an integrated LED which indicated when the device was reading or writing data to prevent premature removal from the computer. The performance was about 10 times faster than writing data to a floppy drive.  DiskOnChip  DiskOnChip Plus MD2811-D32-V3 The DiskOnChip (DoC) product line became popular because they could easily be integrated into small embedded applications. The device was supplied as a module in a 32-pin dual in-line package (DIP) with a pinout and electrical interface compatible with a standard JEDEC socket for memory chips. It employed a memory-mapped interface with an 8 KB window for models of all capacities (16 MB–1 GB). Internally, a DoC module contained a controller that implemented ECC, bad block re-mapping and wear leveling functions that were used to implement a file system, TrueFFS, for which the company provided software development kits. Some time after SanDisk acquired M-Systems, they announced the end-of-life for the DiskOnChip 2000 product line in early 2007, suggesting customers migrate to the uDOC (uDiskOnChip Embedded USB Flash Disk) product, CompactFlash, or SecureDigital cards, all of which are not directly compatible, requiring interface redesign. The subsidiary of M-Systems called EUROM was established to design, build and sell the DOC to the U.S. and Asian embedded computer distributors. The first customer for the DOC was Ampro. David Feldman, President of Ampro and Rick Iorillo, President of EUROM U.S. completed the first deal with IBM to supply 2MB embedded flash drives for recording transportation data on public buses in South America.  TrueFFS  The software that made the computer see the Flash memory as a disk drive was called TrueFFS and it was awarded US patent No. 5404485 in 1995. This software and initially the Flash memory from Toshiba were combined to form the first solid state storage product called DiskOnChip. The DiskOnChip was first designed for the Single Board Computer manufacturers and was a 2 MB chip. The DiskOnChip was made to work with TFFS and was able to bypass the BIOS by disabling the F000 address in the advance CMOS setup. Rick Iorillo lead the development and design efforts in the U.S. and established the first distributor base for the sale of the 28 pin DIP with Ampro being the first customer in the U.S. Sales of the DOC were established with IBM and Brazil to help in capturing the data off the public transportation systems.  Corporate relationships  = IBM = IBM was the first to market USB flash drives in North America, purchasing them from M-Systems and selling them under the IBM- brand label. These USB flash drives became available from IBM on December 15, 2000, and had a storage capacity of 8 MB, more than five times the capacity of the then-common floppy disks. = Samsung = M-Systems did not produce the Flash memory used in their devices. Instead they worked closely with other flash memory manufacturers to use multiple suppliers of memory. In July 1996, Samsung and M-Systems announced a cooperative agreement between them that would combine the Samsung NAND flash memory technology with the M-Systems' TrueFFS controller. = Toshiba = As early as 1998, Toshiba and M-Systems signed mutual agreements to develop and market a number of products for which Toshiba was a sole source. Toshiba agreed to supply a specific portion of its flash memory capacity to M-Systems in 2003. This included an investment by Toshiba in M-Systems. = Saifun Semiconductors = The relationship with Saifun Semiconductors included a US$10 million investment from M-Systems (25% of the total funding Saifun raised) to build products around Saifun's NROM technology. = SanDisk = M-systems was competing in the flash market with SanDisk, but the introduction of the USB drive made a cooperative environment more financially advantageous. In 2004, the two companies entered into a strategic agreement with cross licensing of patents to develop new USB drive platforms introduced in 2005. Ultimately M-Systems was acquired by SanDisk for an all-stock transaction worth US$1.55 billion. A definitive agreement was announced on July 30, 2006, for SanDisk to acquire M-Systems, and on November 19, 2006, the acquisition was complete.

Purpose Land use is governed by a set of regulations generally known as ordinances or municipal codes, which are authorized by the state's zoning enabling law. Within an ordinance is a list of land use designations commonly known as zoning. Each different type of zone has its own set of allowed uses. These are known as by-right uses. Then there is an extra set of uses known as special uses. To build a use that is listed as a special use, a special use permit (or conditional use permit) must be obtained. An example of a special use permit may be found in a church applying for one to construct a church building in a residential neighborhood. Although the church building is not a residential building, the zoning law may allow for churches in the residential neighborhood if the local zoning authority may review the impact on the neighborhood. This process grants discretion to the local zoning authority to ensure that an acceptable land use does not disrupt the zoning scheme because of its particular location. US Zoning Model Act The Standard State Zoning Enabling Act allows special use permits based upon a finding of compatibility with surrounding areas and with developments already permitted under the general provisions of the ordinance. Abuse If the local zoning authority grants a special-use permit that exceeds the discretion allowed to it, then an incidence of spot zoning may arise. Such discretion then may be attacked as ultra vires, and the special-use permit overturned as an unconstitutional violation of equal protection. Special use permits are also required when a property has been deemed a \\"nonconforming use.\\" A special use permit for a nonconforming use will allow the owner of a previously-compliant property to continue the existing use. This often arises when a property has been rezoned or amortized. Amortization is unconstitutional in many states, and is a controversial tool according to many property rights advocacy groups.https://ij.org/case/dallas-amortization/ Other uses Special land- use permits are also issued by the U.S. Forest Service for the operation of ski areas and other recreational facilities in national forests. Special-use permits have also been issued for other purposes, such as in Alaska during the summer of 2015, when special fishing permits were issued to feed firefighters who had difficulty receiving supplies via land routes due to the forest fires that they were fighting in remote areas. In broadcasting, a restricted service licence (UK) or special temporary authority (US) may be issued by a broadcasting authority for temporary changes or set-ups for a radio station or television station. This may be for a temporary LPFM station for a special event (an RSL), or for an unexpected situation such as having to operate at low power from an emergency radio antenna or radio tower after a disaster or major equipment failure (STA).

VanderLugt, Signal detection by complex spatial filtering, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 10, 1964, pp. 139–145. It is commonly used in optics for target tracking and identification. Introduction The correlator has an input signal which is multiplied by some filter in the Fourier domain. An example filter is the matched filter which uses the cross correlation of the two signals. The cross correlation or correlation plane, c(x,y) of a 2D signal i(x,y) with h(x,y) is : c(x,y)=i(x,y) \\\\otimes h^{*}(-x,-y) This can be re-expressed in Fourier space as : C(\\\\xi,\\\\eta)=I(\\\\xi,\\\\eta) H^{*}(-\\\\xi,-\\\\eta) where the capital letters denote the Fourier transform of what the lower case letter denotes. So the correlation can then be calculated by inverse Fourier transforming the result. Implementation According to Fresnel Diffraction theory a convex lens of focal length f will produce the exact Fourier transform at a distance f behind the lens of an object placed f distance in front of the lens. So that complex amplitudes are multiplied, the light source must be coherent and is typically from a laser. The input signal and filter are commonly written onto a spatial light modulator (SLM). A typical arrangement is the 4f correlator. The input signal is written to an SLM which is illuminated with a laser.

The Jew (right) suggests it's money that makes the mayor go. Isaac Leggett Varian (June 25, 1793 - August 10, 1864) was a New York state legislator and the 63rd Mayor of New York City. Political career Varian was a prominent Democrat and led Tammany Hall from 1835 until 1842. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (New York Co.) in 1831, 1832 1833; 63rd Mayor of New York City from 1839 to 1841; and a member of the New York State Senate (1st D.) from 1842 to 1845, sitting in the 65th, 66th, 67th and 68th New York State Legislatures. As Tammany Hall leader, Varian presided over a critical period in Democratic history, which saw the defection, and return of the Locofoco faction, which was in existence from 1835 until 1840, and was the decisive factor in the 1837 mayoral election won by Whigs against the divided Democrats. Varian first ran for mayor in 1838, losing to Whig Aaron Clark by only 519 votes in an election tainted with allegations of massive Whig fraud and intimidation. In 1839 Varian beat Clark by 1,067 votes despite blatant electoral misconduct. During Varian's first term the legislature passed a bill that mandated voter registration and made it a lot harder to commit electoral fraud. Personal In 1811 Varian married Catharine Hopper Dusenbury (1789–1870). They had nine children, seven of whom survived infancy: *Andrew Hopper (1812–1826) *Tamar Letitia (b. 1813) *Isaac (1815–1816) *Matilda Campbell (b. 1817) *Mary Elizabeth (1819–1868) *Isaac (b. 1823) *Catharine Emeline (b. 1826) **Jacob Harsen (twin) (b. 1828) **Hannah (twin) (1828–1830) In 1845 Varian quit politics and retired to Peekskill, where he died in 1864. He is buried in the New York City Marble Cemetery.

Their name is a play on the name of Canadian- American actor Dan Aykroyd. They announced via Facebook and Twitter on 29 September 2011 that they would be disbanding after one farewell tour. Career In 2006, Dananananaykroyd released two limited edition 7\\" singles, \\"Totally Bone\\" and \\"Some Dresses\\" on Moshi Moshi and Jealous Records respectively. A Japan-only CD EP, collecting both singles, was later released on Tokyo's Klee/Rallye records. Singer Giles Bailey left the group and was replaced by drummer Calum Gunn while John Baillie Jnr joined the band on drums and additional lead vocals. Dananananaykroyd released their first EP, Sissy Hits, on London-based Holy Roar Records in June 2008. Shortly after, they introduced ex-Rumsfeld drummer Paul Carlin as their new (other) drummer after James Hamilton of Errors left the band. Dananananaykroyd signed to the independent London label Best Before Records shortly thereafter, and recorded their debut full-length album Hey Everyone! in the US with producer Machine which was released in April 2009. The band have toured the UK extensively with bands such as Foals, Queens of the Stone Age and in 2009 completed a European tour with the Kaiser Chiefs. They played at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in 2009 and 2011. In June 2009, the band announced that bass player Laura Hyde had left, and would be replaced on tour by bassist Ryan McGinness. In August 2009 near the beginning of the band's gig in Sydney, singer John Baillie Junior jumped off stage and broke his arm causing the band to cancel the remainder of their Australian tour, as well as appearances at Pukkelpop and Belladrum festivals. Baillie snapped both bones that run from the wrist to the elbow, shearing a large chunk of bone from his elbow. Emergency surgery was needed in Sydney to fix the injury, leaving four metal screws in his arm permanently. His return show (with Calum and John sharing vocals duties) was Reading Festival only three weeks later which the band opened, playing to 10,000+ people on the Radio 1/NME stage. The band returned to the venue in Sydney two years later (to the day) and continued the show from the floor where he fell. The song \\"Black Wax\\" is featured in the football video game FIFA 10. In 2010, Dananananaykroyd performed on Australian radio station Triple J's Like a Version where they performed their own song \\"Black Wax\\" and a cover on \\"Whip It\\" (originally by Devo) while they were in Sydney; it was recorded the same day as JBJ's accident which saw the rest of the tour being cancelled. The band played a short UK tour in May 2010 under the name 'The Sissy Hits', in which they debuted tracks from the forthcoming record. Over November and December 2010, the band recorded their second album in Los Angeles with producer Ross Robinson, on 16 March 2011 Dananananaykroyd announced details of the album, titled There is a Way, which was released in June 2011.

Burmese novels had existed before but they were written in verse not in prose. Most of these novels were based on Buddhism, myth and legend and history of Burma; therefore there were no novels that were based on everyday lives like Maung Yin Maung, Ma Me Ma. Personal life and death Born in 1866 to a Buddhist family, James Hla Kyaw converted to Christianity after his parents died when he was young, and he was sent to live with his uncle's family who were also Christian converts. James Hla Kyaw was a bright student at school, and he went on to pass many examinations including law. He married four times. His first wife was Ma Khin Htay Ngwe with whom he had two children but later separated. He had no children with his second or third wife, and he died while he was married to his fourth wife, Ma Min Thar. He reverted to Buddhism later in his life after he had studied the Buddha's teachings. He worked as a bank manager, and a mayor in towns, Sagaing, Chaung-U, Budalin. James Hla Kyaw's health deteriorated while he was working as a provincial mayor in Myinmu, a provincial town north of Mandalay. He returned to Rangoon to seek medical treatment but his health continued to deteriorate; therefore, he retired at the age of 37. He decided to write Maung Yin Maung, Ma Me Ma while living in Sint O Dan, Rangoon. He wrote several articles in the Hanthawaddy, the Friend of Burma and the Burma Critics Newspapers. His health turned for the worse after he suffered a stroke. He still could not move his left arm, even after he had recovered. Following his doctor's advice he later moved to a warmer place, Meiktila in Upper Burma, where he died at the age of 53. Life as a writer He started writing Maung Yin Maung, Ma Me Ma while he was in Rangoon. Although the novel was actually a translation of Alexandre Dumas, père's The Count of Monte Cristo, it was more an 'adaptation' than a direct translation as he created his own characters and blended into the story Burmese culture and beliefs. While, Dumas's protagonist took revenge on all those who had mistreated him in the novel, James Hla Kyaw's hero Maung Yin Maung forgave them all, as should be done according to the teachings of the Buddha. The settings were completely different just as the characters were. His novel became a best-seller as Burma's first romantic novel. It was first published in 1904 at No. 71, Phayre Street by Friend of Burma Press with 12 black and white photographs and has since been reprinted six times. Today, over 100 years later, the first novel ever published in Burma is set to hit the big screen. The Moe Kaung Kin Movie Production Company has taken on the task of turning the much-loved Burmese classic into a cinematic masterpiece. Screenplay writer Aung Soe Oo said he and the others had agreed to pay royalty for the book, even though they were not obliged to; a novel or the work of an artist becomes public domain 50 years after the death of its author in Burma. He also stated that to honour the author, they had decided to give a royalty cheque to his next-of-kin in any case. James Hla Kyaw's granddaughter Daw Khin Htar Oo, who lives in Mandalay, would receive the sum of K300,000 (about 300 USD). Besides being a writer, James Hla Kyaw enjoyed huge success as a lawyer and translator. He wrote several articles and law books after completing the novel Maung Yin Maung, Ma Me Ma, an extract from which is included in the newly revised prescribed text for matriculation students as part of Burmese literature. Unfortunately, most of his other novels were destroyed by a great fire during the Second World War and only his first novel survived to this day. He was widely known and remembered today as a great novelist. James Hla Kyaw had suffered from chronic illnesses since he was young, but he never gave up and Burma owes its first novel to him.

Life Anthony Birley believes that Maximus was born no later than AD 99.Birley, Marcus Aurelius: A Biography (London: Routledge, 1993), p. 275 n. 20 An inscription from Aquincum (now at the Gorsium Szabadtéri Museum) provides us details of his cursus honorum. The earliest office Maximus is attested as holding was in the quattuorviri viarum curandarum, one of the four boards that formed the vigintiviri; membership in one of these four boards was a preliminary and required first step toward gaining entry into the Roman Senate. Next he was commissioned a military tribune in Legio IV Scythica, during which time he distinguished himself, earning dona militaria from the emperor Trajan. Maximus returned to Rome, where he became a quaestor serving in the city, and upon completion of this traditional Republican magistracy Maximus was enrolled in the Senate. Following this he served as ab actis Senatus, or recorder of the Acta Senatus. Two more of the traditional Republican magistracies then followed: plebeian tribune, and praetor. Once he stepped down from his duties as praetor, Maximus was assigned a series of imperial posts. First was curator of the Via Aurelia, which Géza Alföldy dates to around 132.Alföldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand unter der Antoninen (Bonn: Rudolf Habelt Verlag, 1977), p. 334 Next he was commissioned legatus legionis or commander of Legio I Adiutrix, then stationed at Brigetio; Alföldy dates this appointment from around 134 to 137. Maximus served as juridius utriusque Pannonia, which was followed by governor of Pannonia Inferior alone, Alföldy dating the later office from the year 137 to 141.Alföldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 250 This was followed by his consulship. Only a few offices of the consular portion of his cursus honorum are known. One is curator of aedium sacrarum canabenses publice, which Alföldy dates to around 144.Alföldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 289 The second was proconsular governor of Africa in 158/159.Alföldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 208 While proconsul he presided at the trial where Apuleius delivered a defense against a charge of magic.Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 96 The Historia Augusta mentions Claudius Maximus as one of Marcus Aurelius' Stoic teachers. Marcus Aurelius also mentions Maximus’ sickness and death as well as that of his wife, Secunda, in his Meditations.Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, viii. 25 As Marcus says Antoninus witnessed Maximus' illness, if this was the cause of his death, then he must have died at some point before the death of Antoninus in 161 AD.Smith, William, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol 2. John Murray, 1872, p. 988 The Historia Augusta reports the following anecdote from the life of Antoninus Pius, which may refer to Claudius Maximus, as Marcus' other main tutors appear to have outlived Antoninus. > It is related of him, too, as an instance of his regard for his family, that > when Marcus [Aurelius] was mourning the death of his tutor and was > restrained by the palace servants from this display of affection, the > Emperor [Antoninus Pius] said: \\"Let him be only a man for once; for neither > philosophy nor empire takes away natural feeling\\".Historia Augusta, > \\"Antoninus Pius\\" Characterization in works =In the Meditations= In the first book of his Meditations, Marcus Aurelius remembers all of the people who have had a strong and benevolent influence upon him. A \\"Maximus\\" is listed last among Marcus Aurelius' teachers and to him is given one of the longer descriptions in the first book. It is likely that Maximus' education of the future emperor took place during the reign of Antoninus Pius. Marcus claims to have learned from Maximus among other virtues self-control, honesty, gravity of character, and kindness.Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, i. 15 He describes Maximus as the perfect sage. Later in the Meditations, Marcus Aurelius, when reflecting on suffering and death remembers how Maximus endured sickness and the death of his wife without complaint. He takes this as a model of good behavior. Historians have had difficulty in the past identifying the person of \\"Maximus\\" mentioned in the Meditations. Méric Casaubon in his 1692 edition of the Meditations refutes in his footnotes a previously held identification of this Maximus with \\"that other Maximus Tyrius; mentioned by Eusebius.\\"Marcus Aurelius, The Meditations, tl. Méric Casaubon, John Churchill, 1692, pp. 8 William Smith some two hundred years later wrote, \\"Some have identified Claudius Maximus with the Maximus who was consul, A.D. 144; Fabricius... identifies him with the Claudius Maximus, 'proconsul of [Africa.]'\\" He concludes, however, that the truth of all these identifications is \\"very uncertain.\\" Only towards the end of the 20th century has there been any consensus on the matter favoring full identification of all these persons with the Maximus of the Meditations (excepting Maximus Tyrius, who was a Platonic). =In the Apologia= In the Apologia, Apuleius, author of The Golden Ass, the only completely-surviving Roman novel, attempts to defend himself against a charge of magic, largely by appealing to his judge whom he identifies as Claudius Maximus. According to Apuleius, Maximus was a pious man who shunned ostentatious displays of wealth and was intimately familiar with the works of Plato and Aristotle. Apuleius refers to Maximus as \\"one, who holds so austere a creed and has so long endured military service\\".Apuleius, Apologia, i. 19 Apuleius also makes reference to the sternness of his judge's philosophy which is understood to be a reference to Stoicism.Apuleius, Apologia, i. 19 Though Apuleius is clearly trying to flatter his judge, at least some of his attributions were likely true since he was acquitted. =In the Historia Augusta= The Historia Augusta mentions Claudius Maximus in a single sentence in the section on Marcus Aurelius. The sentence is unclear as to whether the philosophers listed were Stoics or whether the intention is to mention unspecified Stoic philosophers.Tantum autem studium in eo philosophiae fuit ut adscitus iam in imperatoriam tamen ad domum Apollonii discendi causa veniret. audivit et Sextum Chaeronensem Plutarchi nepotem, Iunium Rusticum, Claudium Maximum et Cinnam Catulum, Stoicos. (\\"He also attended the lectures of Sextus of Chaeronea, the nephew of Plutarch, Junius Rusticus, Claudius Maximus and Cinna Catulus, Stoics.\\") It is from this entry that association was originally made between the Claudius Maximus of the Apologia and the Maximus mentioned in the Meditations. Although the Historia Augusta is known for its inaccuracies, Pierre Hadot feels that there is no reason to doubt this portion of the text because it accurately characterizes other philosophers mentioned in the same paragraph.Hadot, The Inner Citadel (1998), p. 17 On the other hand, the identification of Sextus of Chaeronea as a Stoic is disputed.

The compilation also included the written pieces \\"The Three Questions\\", \\"The Coffee-House of Surat\\", and \\"How Much Land Does a Man Need?\\". Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn refers to the story in Cancer Ward. Characters Simon - A humble shoemaker who is very poor Matryona - Wife of Simon Michael - Angel punished by God and is turned into a mortal Plot A kind and humble shoemaker maker called Simon goes out one day to purchase sheep-skins in order to sew a winter coat for his wife and himself to share. Usually, the little money which Simon earns would be spent to feed his wife and children. Simon decides that in order to afford the skins he must go on a collection to receive the five rubles and twenty kopeks owed to him by his customers. As he heads out to collect the money he also borrows a three-rouble note from his wife's money box. While going on his collection he only manages to receive twenty kopeks rather than the full amount. Feeling disheartened by this, Simon rashly spends the twenty kopeks on vodka and starts to head back home drunkenly stumbling and talking to himself cursing the coat dealer. He states that he is warm without the vodka and that he won't make it through the winter without a fur coat. While approaching the chapel at the end of the road, Simon stops and notices something pale-looking leaning against it. He looks harder and notices that it is a naked man who appears poor of health. At first, he is suspicious and fears that the man may have no good intentions if he is in such a state, believing that he is just a drunk man. He proceeds to pass the man until he sees that the man has lifted his head and is looking towards him. Simon debates what to do in his mind and feels ashamed for his disregard and heads back to help the man. Simon takes off his cloth coat and wraps it around the stranger. He also gives him the extra pair of boots he was carrying. He aids him as they both walk toward Simon's home. Though they walk together side by side, the stranger barely speaks and when Simon asks how he was left in that situation the only answers the man would give are: \\"I cannot tell\\" and \\"God has punished me.\\" Meanwhile, Simon's wife Matryona debates whether or not to bake more bread for the night's meal so that there is enough for the following morning's breakfast. She decides that the loaf of bread that they have left would be ample enough to last until the next morning. As she sees Simon approaching the door she is angered to see him with a strange man who is wrapped in Simon's clothing. Matryona immediately expresses her displeasure with Simon, accusing him and his strange companion to be drunkards and harassing Simon for not returning with the sheep-skin needed to make a new coat. Once the tension settles down she bids that the stranger sit down and have dinner with them. After seeing the stranger take bites at the bread she placed for him on his plate, she begins to feel pity and shows so in her face. When the stranger notices this, his grim expression lights up immediately and he smiles for one brief moment. After hearing the story from the stranger of how Simon had kindly robed the stranger after seeing him in his naked state, Matryona grabs more of Simon's old clothing and gives it to the stranger. The following morning Simon addresses the stranger and asks his name. The stranger answers that his name is simply Michael. Simon explains to Michael that he can stay in his household as long as he can earn his keep by working as an assistant for Simon in his shoemaking business. Michael agrees to these terms and for a few years he remains a very faithful assistant. One winter day a customer who is a nobleman comes in their shop. The nobleman outlines strict conditions for the construction of a pair of thick leather boots: they should not lose shape nor become loose at the seams for a year, or else he would have Simon arrested. When Simon gives to Michael the leather that the nobleman had given them to use, Michael appears to stare beyond the nobleman's shoulder and smiles for the second time since he has been there. As Michael cuts and sews the leather, instead of making thick leather boots, he makes a pair of soft leather slippers. Simon is too late when he notices this and cries to Michael asking why he would do such a foolish thing. Before Michael can answer, a messenger arrives at their door and gives the news that the nobleman has died and asks if they could change the order to slippers for him to wear on his death bed. Simon is astounded by this and watches as Michael gives the messenger the already-made leather slippers. Time continues to go by and Simon is very grateful for Michael's faithful assistance. In the sixth year, another customer comes in who happens to be a woman with two girls, one of which is crippled. The woman requests if she could order a pair of leather shoes for each of the girls — three shoes of the same size, since they both share the same shoe size, and another shoe for the crippled girl's lame foot. As they are preparing to fill the order Michael stares intently at the girls and Simon wonders why he is doing so. As Simon takes the girls' measurements he asks the woman if they are her own children and how was the girl with the lame foot crippled. The woman explains that she has no relation to them and that the mother on her deathbed accidentally crushed the leg of the crippled girl. She expresses that she could not find it in her heart to leave them in a safe home or orphanage and took them as her own. When Michael hears this he smiles for the third time since he has been there. After the woman and the two children finally left, Michael approaches Simon and bids him farewell explaining that God has finally forgiven him. As Michael does this he begins to be surrounded by a heavenly glow and Simon acknowledges that he is not an ordinary man. Simon asks him why light emits from him and why did he smile only those three times. Michael explains that he is an angel who was given the task to take away a woman's life so she could pass on to the next life. He allowed the woman to live because she begged that she must take care of her children for no one other than their mother could care for them. When he did this God punished him for his disobedience and commanded that he must find the answers to the following questions in order to be an angel again: What dwells in man?, What is not given to man?, and What do men live by? After Michael returned to earth to take the woman's soul, the woman's lifeless body rolled over and crushed the leg of the now crippled girl. Then Michael's wings left him and he no longer was an angel but a naked and mortal man. When Simon rescued him he knew that he must begin finding the answers to those questions. He learned the answer to the first question when Matryona felt pity for him, thus smiling and realizing that what dwells in man is \\"love\\". The answer to the second question came to him when he realized that the angel of death was looming over a nobleman who was making preparations for a year though he would not live till sunset; thus Michael smiled, realizing that what is not given to man is \\"to know his own needs.\\" Lastly, he comprehended the answer to the final question when he saw the woman with the two girls from the mother of whom he previously did not take the soul, thus smiling and realizing that regardless of being a stranger or a relation to each other, \\"all men live not by care for themselves but by love.\\" Michael concluded, saying, \\"I have now understood that though it seems to men that they live by care for themselves, in truth it is love alone by which they live. He who has love, is in God, and God is in him, for God is love.\\" When Michael finished, he sang praise to God as wings appeared on his back and he rose to return to heaven.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on August 7, 1974 as Somers Town House and designated a National Historic Landmark in 2005 as Elephant Hotel. It is also a contributing property in the NRHP-listed Somers Hamlet Historic District. It is located at 335 US 202, across from the northern end of NY 100.  History  The Elephant Hotel photographed for the Historic American Buildings Survey in the 1930s. Hachaliah Bailey (known as the creator of Bailey Circus) built the Elephant Hotel in Somers, NY, after buying an African elephant, which he named \\"Old Bet\\". Bailey intended to use the elephant for farm work, but the number of people it attracted caused Bailey to tour her throughout the northeast. Old Bet was killed on tour in 1816, when she was shot by a local farmer. Bailey's tours were the first of their type in the nation, and inspired numerous others to tour with exotic animals, and during the 1830s the old style circus and Bailey's attractions merged to form the modern circus. Due to this, Somers is known as the \\"Cradle of the American Circus\\". Bailey had purchased this land in 1805, and began construction of the hotel in 1821, as a memorial to the animals he displayed. It is said Old Bet was buried in front of the building. The monument to Old Bet that stands in front of the hotel was placed in 1827. In 1835, the hotel was incorporated by the Zoological Institute.History of the Elephant Hotel, Somershitoricalsoc.org The Elephant Hotel was purchased by the town of Somers in 1927. It is a town landmark and was dedicated a National Historic Landmark in 2005. Museum of the Early American Circus The Somers Historical Society occupies the third floor of the building.

On the air since 1953, the station provides music, entertainment and information for patients. Since August 1998 the station has been broadcasting continuously 24 hours a day. Programmes include Ward Call (patients request and dedications), specialist programmes covering country, classical, dance, jazz, easy listening and world music, extensive sports coverage, general entertainment and information for patients. Radio Sunderland provides full match commentary of all Sunderland A.F.C. home matches live from the Stadium of Light with their own commentary team. Radio Sunderland is a registered charity and relies entirely on donations and fundraising to stay on the air. The station is run entirely by volunteers, no one is paid for the services they give.  The Story of Radio Sunderland The association's inaugural meeting was held in 1953 following a plea in the local newspaper, The Sunderland Echo, for volunteers. Broadcasting commenced during the 1954/1955 football season. The station was formed as the Commentators' Association in 1953. The aim was to relay live football commentaries form Roker Park direct to the wards of Sunderland's Hospitals. During those early years, in a cup tie with Spurs an over enthusiastic commentator jumped up to help a Sunderland forward head in a goal, but he forgot about the low roof of the commentary box and knocked himself out. One of the other commentators, in true Hospital Radio fashion, grabbed the microphone and carried on with the commentary! Music was introduced to the station output with the advent of the first patients request programme \\"Hospital Hour\\", first broadcast on Boxing day 1956. This marked the beginning of programme development. Other programmes at that time included commentaries on athletics from Ashbrooke Sports Ground and Hospital Quiz shows. Reflecting the wider programming, and following an influx of volunteers the association changed its name to \\"Sunderland Hospitals Broadcasts\\" in 1968 and was now broadcasting regular programmes from the old General Hospital in Sunderland on Thursday and Friday evenings. This was followed by a move to the first permanent studio which was based in an old ward at what was the Havelock Hospital on Hylton Road. Equipment was begged and borrowed, Tyne Tees Television being a major benefactor, donating their old surplus equipment. Due to the enthusiasm and expertise of the then members, the ward was converted into a fully equipped radio studio. Now that they had a studio and a full and varied programme schedule it was decided that they should have a new snappier identification, so the present name of \\"Radio Sunderland for Hospitals\\" was adopted in 1973. When the new District General Hospital (now called the Sunderland Royal) was opened in 1978 the station transferred to a new but very small studio in the Hylton Road Block. Following a vigorous campaign for more working space they were on the move once again & in 1988 the station transferred to its present location in the former nurses home of Monkwearmouth Hospital. Much of the equipment from the General Hospital Studio was transferred to the new studio but the members still set themselves a target of raising £30,000 to build and equip this new studio complex.

The parliament established in 1910 had a certain legislative authority, however, its resolutions were subject to approval by the Austrian and Hungarian government. It ceased its operation in July 1914 and was legally abolished in 1915. Background Congress of Berlin in progress, painting by Anton von Werner Upon the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Ottoman Bosnia and Herzegovina in the wake of the 1878 Congress of Berlin, the Bosniak, Croat and Serb people of the country were given the chance to surrender peacefully, and accept new government without a fight. To the surprise of the Vienna government, this proposal was strongly rejected by partisan resistance. Nevertheless, the reinforced troops of the 13th Austro- Hungarian Army corps led by Lieutenant General Josip Filipović could not be stopped. As Foreign Minister Gyula Andrássy had assured the Sublime Porte of a \\"temporary\\" occupation, the lands of Bosnia and Hercegovina de facto were administered by Austria-Hungary, but de jure remained part of the Ottoman Empire. The occupational period (1878–1908) was divided into a period of martial governance, which ended in 1882 when the period of civil governance started. In 1908 Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of his rule, in response to the Young Turks movement ordered the official annexation, sparking the Bosnian crisis which lasted until 1909. The Austro-Hungarian government could laboriously stem Ottoman and Serbian outrage with the support of the German Empire. Establishment In the post- annexation period on February 17, 1910 Emperor Franz Joseph decreed a Bosnian- Herzegovinian constitution. Law and ordinance gazette for Bosnia and Hercegovina No. 19, 1910 It was regulated by six main laws: * the Constitution (Zemaljski statut) * Elections policy (Izborni red) * Rules of council's procedures (Saborski poslovni red) * Laws on political parties (Zakon o društvima u BiH) * Rules on principles of assembly (Zakon sakupljanja u BiH) * Laws on regulating the work of region councils (Zakon o kotarskim vijećima) Regardless of all the restraints on Bosnian autonomy, the Constitution and its laws introduced three new institutions into the political sphere of this country: * Bosnian-herzegovinian diet (Bosansko-hercegovački sabor) * National council (Zemaljski savjet) * Regional council (Kotarsko vijeće ) It was necessary to guarantee the basic civil rights and to regulate public assembly since these rights are the foundations of parliamentary life. Before the first council elections =Election survey= In 1909, after the settling of the annexation crisis the new government started the preparation for establishment of the Bosnian constitution. To pacify the public of Bosnia, on February 8, 1909 the new government called for the election survey that was introduced by Baron Benko. He presented the main principles of the future constitution, among which were the Bosnian Diet, its authority and its members. The first principle of the Diet was in the Emperor's letter which was the part of the annexation agreement and which described the ways of constituting the future council. The constitution was intended to guarantee basic human rights, and thus its authority did not include the common affairs of Austria-Hungary, such as diplomatic, martial, monopolistic, and the Emperor's missions. This put the country of Bosnia and Herzegovina in subordinate relation to both Austria and Hungary, administrated by the common k.u.k. Ministry of Finance. However, the authority of the Diet did include all judicial and executive power in the country itself. The legislative power belonged to the Emperor who was the only one to approve new laws. Nikola Stojanović, a member of the Bosnian Serb National Organization (SNO), spoke with Baron Benko. He said that he and his fellow party members could not participate in the survey since they were invited as individuals, not as representatives of their political party, which Baron Benko justified by saying that SNO was not formally recognized by the new government, a claim that Stojanović rejected. What the members of SNO wanted was the autonomy of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and they rejected the new constitutional reforms. Since their requests remained unfulfilled, all the party members restrained from the politics. Stojanović's speech was printed in Zagreb by his own request to avoid possible accusations that such requests never existed. The members of MNO (Muslimanska Narodna Organizacija): Firdus, Karabeg, and Miralem, firmly rejected participation in the survey and thus did not participate in the first meeting on constitutional survey. The members of all parties except MNO, SNO, and the Social Democratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina, participated in the constitutional survey. The representatives of the Catholics was the HNZ, Štadler clerk party, the representatives of the Muslims was the MNS, and the representatives of the Orthodox were SNSS, and its leader Lazar Dimitrijević. The survey showed unified opinion of all its members, especially on economic growth of native population. All the members criticized the regulations on tariffs and railroads, and they requested that Bosnian Diet have the authority over customs, indirect taxes and monopoly. =Writing the Constitution= When the survey ended on May 4, 1909, MNO published pamphlets called \\"Our Constitutional Regime\\" where it stated the stand of their party on the new constitution. They wanted representative members of all political parties to discuss the new Constitution. The main condition for this meeting posed by MSN was allowing for public elections, agreements and political activism. Their main concern was the foundation of full parliamentary and legal autonomy of Bosnia and Herzegovina. MNO declared their will to keep in communication with the Serbs since they also demanded the governing of the country by a national council (parliament) to consist of 31 Orthodox members, 24 Muslim members and 16 Catholic members; and not by the Zagreb Sabor council consisting of 116 Catholic members, 69 Orthodox members and 24 Muslim members. Due to the liberalism in the pamphlets the editors of Musvata that published them were fined 1,500 krone. After declaring the annexation by Gligorije Jeftanović, the fight for autonomy ended and the Bosnian-Serbian alliance quickly fell apart. When annexation was declared and the MNO moved to the opposition, the MNS saw the opportunity to impose themselves as political representatives of the Bosnian people. They were very interested in the promised constitution and thus they suggested annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to Croatia, which they saw as an opportunity to solve their constitutional problems. Moreover, they asked for protection of language rights of native Bosniaks over that of colonizing powers, especially from German. The representatives of MNS gave their proposal on the constitution to Baron Benko at the first survey meeting. This proposal included: *Protecting Muslim Bosniaks from forceful conversion to Catholicism *Protecting private property and keeping the agrarian rights that were law from 1859 *Having Bosnia and Herzegovina as one unity *Protecting Muslim matrimonial, familial and inheritance rights. The process of forming a constitution was very slow. Only after a year and a half of work, when the constitution was almost ready, did the MNO declare annexation and loyalty to the governing Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty. However, they requested an increase in the number of Muslim representatives on the Diet, following the same principle as that of the Catholics and Orthodox. They also wanted a greater role in the choosing process. The last demand was an increase in number of intellectuals in the membership. These requests were denied. The constitution and laws following it were approbated by Emperor Franz Joseph on November 17, 1910. The ceremony was held and attended by all members of government, higher government representatives, religious representatives, and many other notable people. The acclamation was read by Marjan Varešanin, who briefly announced the new changes in the country and read the Emperor's decree on establishing the new Constitution. Structure The Bosnian Council started its work on February 20, 1910. It consisted of members belonging to different social, confessional, and regional groups. The Bosnian Council, unlike other representative institutions in the monarchy, did not have an established domestic tradition. According to Council's order the members belonged to three groups, differing by religion. Within these groups there was another grouping according to the social status of members: #Aristocrats and intellectuals #Urban group #Rural group The national government suggested electing one delegate per 25,000 citizens. The 1895 census showed a population of 1,568,092 citizens, of whom 548,632 were Muslims, 627,246 Orthodox and 334,142 Catholics. According to the data the Council had 72 delegates, 16 of whom were Catholics, 24 Muslims, 31 Orthodox and only one Jew. All male citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina who were over the age of 24 and lived in Bosnia and Herzegovina for more than a year had the active right to vote. Women also had the active right to vote if they paid a land tax of 140 kronen or more. A passive right to vote belonged to all males older than 30 years of age who enjoyed citizen's rights. In reality the situation was different. It was highly dependent on group and confession. An equal balance was established for all three religious groups, which was one of the main principles of Austro-Hungarian government in Bosnia and Herzegovina. A delegate's mandate lasted for five years, and the voters had no right of repeal. The president and vice-president were chosen by the tzar who tried to balance their confessional choice in circular order. Besides the elected members the following members were always introduced: *Muslims - Reis, the principal of Muslim's granted lands, Muslim's regional leader from Mostar and the regional leader who was elected the first. *Orthodox - four Metropolitans and the president of the Orthodox community *Catholics - archbishop and two province members of Franciscan order of Bosnia and Herzegovina *Jews - Sephardic rabbi of higher order *The president of Supreme Court, the president of Sarajevo attorney chamber, the mayor of nation capital Sarajevo, and the president of Sarajevo trading chamber. This structure was to ensure the conservative Council. Moreover, the Constitutional article 35 stated that the Council cannot speak with other representatives or make any sort of announcements; the Council's meeting cannot have any outsider delegates, and the Council itself can send delegates to the tzar only after requesting and getting approval. According to the Constitution, Bosnia and Herzegovina was a unique region with a unique position in the monarchy, thus it was represented as a unique administrative unit - corpus separatum - called a condominium. This legal subjectivity was partly reflected by the Bosnian Council but direct participation on the level with Austria and Hungary was never allowed. National Council was the institution aiming to ensure a better legal and political position of Bosnia within the monarchy. But regardless of all restrictions, Bosnian Council was centre stage of the entire civilian and political life of the country. First diet elections The national government held the first council elections on May 18-May 28, 1910. The MNO and MSS negotiated the creation of a collaboration and sharing the possible mandates. MNO suggested giving six mandates to MSS; this they rejected. After the elections, all 31 Orthodox mandates were given to the SNO, and all 24 Muslim mandates were given to the MNO. The HNZ received 14 out of 16 Catholic places, and the other four went to HKZ led by Archbishop Josip Štadler. A large number of voters took part. In village regions 83% of Muslims and 85% of Orthodox, though only 61% of Catholics exercised their vote. Neither MSS nor the Democrats who voted for Osman Đikić got any seats. The MNO party was so powerful that peasants refused to listen to Đikić's or Smail-aga Ćemalović's speeches. In the beginning the Council, from 1910 onwards chaired by MNO leader Safvet-beg Bašagić, worked on an agreement. However, almost all four of the meetings they had included Serbian and Croatian nationalist arguments of their right over Bosnia and Herzegovina, which started even with the first bill concerning the opening of a postal savings bank. This together with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria on 28 June 1914 finally led to the cessation of the meetings on July 9. World War I shortly followed. The Bosnian Diet was officially dissolved by order of 6 February 1915. Abolition István Tisza Until World War I, Bosnia and Herzegovina was a separate governing body within the structure of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. It had a special legal system and a special status in which its citizens were treated as neither Austrians nor Hungarians. Such political subjectivity was mainly reflected through Bosnian Council. But even after the Bosnian Council was abolished, the country still had special legal and political status that was often discussed among the highest representatives of the monarchy. Stjepan Sarkotić, the governor of Bosnia and Herzegovina during World War I, suggested forming an administrative senate instead of a Bosnian Council that would function as a sort of representative body. The suggestion was rejected with an explanation that Bosnian Council was not abolished and that it would be brought to function again as soon as circumstances changed. The legal status of Bosnia was seriously considered with an effort to prevent the possible destruction of Austro-Hungary and to obstruct the solution of the Yugoslav question. Austria insisted on the annexing of Bosnia to Austria, while Hungary insisted on annexing it to Hungary. Moreover, various plans for dividing Bosnia among the two countries existed. Hungary would get regions of Banja Luka and Bihać, while Austria would get the remaining regions. The prime minister of the Hungarian government István Tisza thought that political balance in the Monarchy could only be achieved by annexing Bosnia to Hungary, since Poland was already annexed to Austria. This failed when the Yugoslav orientated politicians of Bosnia and Herzegovina, mainly Serbs and Croats, on September 20, 1918 requested that Bosnian people be allowed to choose their own status. Meanwhile, the Yugoslav question was highly active with the goal to form one unified country, Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

It was an extension of the privately promoted Ely, Haddenham & Sutton Railway that had opened in 1866. It was a standard gauge single track. The line was worked by the neighbouring Great Eastern Railway but it was never profitable. The development of road transport services in the 1920s caused a steep decline in use of the line, and the passenger service was withdrawn in 1931. A goods service continued, but the line closed completely in 1964. No railway activity takes place on the route now. Origins The Eastern Counties Railway opened its line from Cambridge to Ely in 1845. The Ely and Huntingdon Railway was authorised in 1845; it was to build from east to west though St Ives, but it was unable to raise sufficient money to build the whole of its line. Instead it opened only between St Ives and a station named Huntingdon, that was actually in Godmanchester, east of the River Great Ouse. The opening date was 17 August 1847, and the Eastern Counties Railway between Cambridge and St Ives was opened on the same day.Peter Paye, The Ely and St Ives Railway, Oakwood Press, 1982, The Ely, Haddenham and Sutton RailwayThe East Anglian Railway soon acquired the Ely and Huntingdon Railway, but it did not consider that progressing the completion of the Ely and Huntingdon scheme was worthwhile, and it allowed the powers to lapse. In August 1862 the Eastern Counties Railway merged with other lines to form the Great Eastern Railway; this heralded a change of policy in that the Great Eastern Railway decided to encourage local schemes for connecting and feeder railways. Accordingly in the Autumn of 1863 two prominent landowners, Oliver Claude Pell of Wilburton and Frederick Camps of Haddenham, generated enough support from other landowners in the area to consider building a line linking Ely and Sutton, about a third of the extent of the unbuilt Ely to St Ives line. The route was planned at first to be direct via Witchford, but Pell and Camps insisted on a route further south to serve their estates and the planned route of the line was altered accordingly. This had the incidental benefit of aligning the route on lower ground throughout, with easy gradients. The line was to be known as the Ely, Haddenham and Sutton Railway.R S Joby, The Ely & St Ives Railway, Klofron, Norwich; no further publication details in the print book The Great Eastern Railway considered assisting the promoters of the Ely, Haddenham and Sutton Railway, but they were sceptical about its potential profitability. Now the local company proposed an extension from Sutton to Somersham on the St Ives to March line and this changed the GER position, as they saw this as a threat to their strategic intentions, potentially facilitating an incursion by the Great Northern Railway. Authorisation The GER were therefore anxious to dissuade the local company from the Somersham extension, and they offered to support the local scheme to the extent of one third of the required capital if they would drop it. This was agreed to, and the Ely, Haddenham and Sutton Railway got its Act of Parliament on 23 June 1864. Share capital was £36,000 with borrowing powers of £12,000. The GER was authorised to subscribe £12,000, and the EH&SR; had running powers to enter Ely station.D I Gordon, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 5: the Eastern Counties, David & Charles (Publishers) Limited, Newton Abbot, 1977, E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959H H Meik, The East Anglian Railway, in the Railway Magazine, October 1909 A construction contract was let to W S Simpson of Ely in the sum of £48,000; early in 1866 the EH&SR; agreed a working arrangement with the GER, for 50% of gross receipts. Opening Captain Tyler made an inspection of the line for the Board of Trade on 28 March 1866. He identified numerous shortcomings, and permission for opening to passenger trains was refused. Urgent improvements were put in hand, and Tyler authorised opening on 7 July 1866 subject to completion of certain final rectification. The formal opening of the line took place on 6 April 1866, and the full public opening was on 16 April 1866.Leslie Oppitz, East Anglia Railways Remembered, Countryside Books, Newbury, 1989, At a shareholders' meeting in September 1866, the directors reported that receipts had been disappointing due to cattle plague, which had been prevalent in the area: passenger receipts from the opening until 30 June were £161, and the total for all traffic was £366. By the end of June 1867, £49,679 had been expended on the building of the railway and associated work. A 2% dividend was declared at the first half yearly meeting in 1868. Passenger carryings were meagre; Gordon attributes this to the fact that \\"third-class facilities were restricted to the Parliamentary trains [once daily], and the normal fare from Ely to Sutton [7 miles] was 2s at a time when local wages were under 10s a week.\\" In May 1868 the GER informed the company that in the previous year the line had operated at a loss of £1,211. The GER demanded an increase in the charge for the working of the line but the EH&SR; refused, saying that the ten-year working agreement was a firm contractual commitment and must stand. Extending to St Ives The Ely and St Ives RailwayThe idea of an extension beyond Sutton to St Ives was revived again in 1872. The GER feared an incursion by the Great Northern Railway: the GNR had a lease of the Somersham to Ramsey branch until 1864. The possibility of the GNR using its own Ramsey branch as a springboard to get to Somersham and then to Ely was an ever- present danger to the GER.John Rhodes, Branch Lines to Ramsey, Oakwood press, Headington, 1986, To ward this off, the GER planned an extension to St Ives for the 1876 session of Parliament; the cost was to be £62,928. The Ely, Haddenham and Sutton Railway Extension Act was passed on 7 April 1876; the Act authorised £60,000 in share capital and borrowing powers of £20,000. The EH&SR; was also authorised to change its name to the Ely and St Ives Railway when the extension was open for traffic. William T Mousley got the contract for construction of the line, having tendered £17,840; materials, land etc were to be supplied by the GER. The GER was authorised to lease the company on a 999 year lease, and it would pay 4% on the £36,000 ordinary stock and 5% on the £60,000 extension stock. Major-General Hutchinson inspected the line for the Board of Trade on 3 May 1878, and with minor criticisms, he approved the opening of the line to passenger traffic. It opened on 10 May 1878. It was leased to the GER for 999 years, authorised by Act of 21 July 1879; the GER guaranteed interest of 2% per annum on the £38,000 ordinary shares and 5% on the £60,000 extension stock; the former was to be raised to 4% from 1881. From this time the Ely and St Ives Railway Company was simply a financial organisation, and the GER acquired it on 2 Dec 1896. The sale price was £128,000 in GER 4% debenture stock. The last board meeting of the Ely and St Ives Railway was on 3 August 1898. After 1900 In the 1920s fruit production gained in importance locally; a former station master at Stretham reminisced that \\"It was a time when... trainloads of fruit pickers would arrive to be taken to their primitive camps in the nearby fields.\\" Following World War I a local bus service was started in the area in 1919; the competition was an immediate blow to passenger carryings on the line; in addition there was a general depression in the agricultural sector in the locality, and financial losses were heavy. In an attempt to reduce costs, the conductor-guard system was introduced on passenger trains from December 1922, and booking offices at most stations were closed. So that the conductor-guard could patrol the whole train to take fares, six-wheel coaches were modified with centre gangways within the coaches and doors at end for the conductor- guard to use. The omnibus services gained in strength and were disastrous for the line: in 1928 only £7,562 was taken on the line from passengers. The passenger service could not sustain the losses, and it was closed on 2 February 1931, although half-day excursions to London and elsewhere were subsequently run sporadically. On 6 October 1958 Earith Bridge was closed and the line from Sutton to Earith Bridge station was kept in use as a siding. Sugar beet traffic sustained the line for the time being, and the line from Ely to Sutton remained in use until 13 July 1964. From St Ives (Needingworth Junction) to the mill at Bluntisham was closed on 5 October 1964. Train services There were typically three return passenger train trips daily between Ely and St Ives, stopping at all stations; there was an additional return trip on Mondays and Thursdays. The time between Ely and St Ives was about 45 minutes. Sutton and Haddenham were the busiest stations but there were few passengers overall. In 1927 the line recorded 15,000 passengers and ran 2,100 passenger trains, an average of only seven or eight passengers per train. The goods traffic in the early years was chiefly wheat, coal and potatoes, but in the 1890s fruit became more prominent. Haddenham and Sutton were the main goods yards with extensive sidings. Sugar beet was also transported to the mill at Ely. Location list Stations from Stretham to Sutton were opened 16 April 1866. Earith Bridge and Bluntisham stations opened on 10 May 1878 and Sutton station was relocated on the same day. All the stations closed to passengers on 2 February 1931; there was some subsequent use for excursions, but it is not recorded whether all the stations were used for the purpose.M E Quick, Railway Passenger Stations in England Scotland and Wales—A Chronology, The Railway and Canal Historical Society, 2002 Trains for the branch left Ely in a southerly direction and diverged westward at Sutton Branch Junction. The first station was Stretham; an editor writing in 2007 stated that the station building could still be seen on Stretham Station Road. Wilburton was the next station; the station building had been incorporated into a much enlarged private house. Haddenham followed, and the site was then used as an industrial estate, on the present day A1421 road between Haddenham and Sutton-in-the-Isle. At Haddenham, the railway made a sharp curve to the north. Sutton station served the village of Sutton-in-the-Isle. When it was the terminus of the Ely, Haddenham and Sutton Railway, it ended in a northward direction. When the line was extended to Ely, the line diverged a short distance south of the former terminus, which became a goods yard. The new passenger station was a little way to the south-west of the former station, and the access road from the village was extended to reach it. Remains of the freight shed still existed in 2007, in private ownership. The line now ran west and then south-west to the next station, Earith Bridge. The station could not be located close to Earith village because of the dykes at the Old Bedford River and New Bedford River. Instead, the line ran south of the village near to the present-day marinas. The final station was Bluntisham. It was still extant in 2007 and was in use as a private dwelling. The line ended at Needingworth Junction, where it converged with the line from March, running south to St Ives station.

It is a Christian story magazine that uses true stories to illustrate Bible passages and is targeted to 10- to 14-year-old youth. Guide is often distributed to \\"Earliteen\\" and \\"Junior\\" Sabbath School students at the end of class and provides a Bible study guide for the week. Since its beginning, Guide has been popular reading during the church service for young people. The magazine is published in a 32-page full- color 6x8\\" format. History Junior Guide magazine from December 4, 1963 In the years following World War II, the Adventist church had two magazines for children – Our Little Friend for children preschool to preteen and Youth's Instructor for older teenagers. A magazine for junior-age youth was originally proposed at the 1951 Autumn Council of the Seventh-day Adventist Church and voted in Spring Council on April 9, 1952 designating the Review and Herald as the publisher. A relatively young 27-year-old pastor from Northern California, Lawrence Maxwell became the first editor. The magazine was announced in an ad in the Youth's Instructor in 1953 promising a magazine \\"Packed with stories, pictures, games, puzzles, camp craft, Junior Sabbath School lessons, and interesting Pathfinder activity\\" in a 16-page weekly publication. A contest to decide the name of the magazine was advertised in the Youth's Instructor magazine and drew 16,000 entries. Of those entries 225 suggested Junior Guide which became the original name of the magazine. At the launch of the magazine, there were complaints that it looked much like Youth's Instructor. Another complaint was that the margins were too wide. In January 1953 the format of the magazine was changed to a smaller size, page margins were reduced and the number of pages increased to 24 per issue. Beginning in 1954 color ink was used for three issues a month. The entire magazine would be printed in green, brown or blue tint, including the illustrations. The magazine included a steady formula of stories of worldwide missionary activities, crafts, stories of inventions, conversions and life lessons. The magazine cover always included a photo of children engaging in wholesome activities reflecting the times. Subscriptions reached 28,000 after one year and 43,000 after 10 years. With the segmentation of the church into \\"junior\\" and \\"earliteen\\" divisions the name of the magazine was changed from Junior Guide to Guide as of January 1, 1964 and it was focused on elementary school grades 7-8. With the changing times of the 60s and 70s and the advent of a new editor, the Guide changed also. Multi-ethnic images in non-mission stories were featured as well as placed on the cover of the magazine. Stories against racial prejudice and segregation appeared and circulation reached a record of 60,000 subscriptions, based partly on the demise of the Youth's Instructor. By this time the magazine had expanded to 32 pages. In the 1980s a new feature was introduced – Guidelines question and answer column written by Madeline Johnson. Another introduction was the \\"Guide Dog\\" mascot who first appeared in 1985 at the international Pathfinder camporee in Colorado and since at campmeetings, camporees and conventions where Guide readers congregate. At least one predatory incident in the 1990s put an end to a four decade Guide tradition of penpals. Circulation also began to decline during this period. In 2000 Guide switched to a four-color format as production costs declined and circulation began increasing. During 2002–2003 Guide celebrated its 50th anniversary. Authors for the Guide range from church workers to housewives and come from all parts of the world. They are devout Christians, including Baptists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Roman Catholics, and Seventh-day Adventists. They are aged from under nine to over 90 years old. =Editors= *1953–1970 Lawrence Maxwell *1970–1983 Lowell Litten *1983–1986 Penny Estes Wheeler *1986–1994 Jeannette Johnson *1995–1997 Carolyn Sutton *1997–1999 Tim Lale *1999—2016 Randy Fishell *2016–Present Kathleen Beagles Contents of a Guide *Stories *Editorials *Factory Facts *Smile File *Explore God's Word *Junior Sabbath School Lesson *Earliteen Sabbath School Lesson *Find the Coin See also *List of Seventh-day Adventist periodicals *Pacific Press Publishing Association *Seventh-day Adventist Church References External links *Guide website Category:Children's magazines published in the United States Category:Magazines established in 1953 Category:Magazines published in Idaho Category:Religious works for children Category:Religious magazines published in the United States Category:Seventh-day Adventist periodicals Category:Weekly magazines published in the United States ","title":"Guide (Adventist magazine)"},{"id":"9484004","text":"Good Causes is the sixth album from folk singer Gamble Rogers.

In slang it is also called a bommie.Collins Dictionary. Example, \\"Manly itself has [...] the offshore Queenscliff “Bommie” (bombora), joy for big wave riders.\\", Australia's 8 greatest surf spots , Australian Geographic. As the wave passes over the shallow area its shape is raised and steepened, creating a localised wave formation. The size and shape of bombora waves makes them attractive to surfers willing to take the risk of riding what is generally considered a hazardous pursuit. These formations can pose a significant danger even in good weather as a bombora may not be identifiable because it may not always have breaking waves. The term Bombora was given wide circulation in 2009 on ABC TV with the airing of a documentary titled Bombora - The Story of Australian Surfing, which received a nomination for the 2010 Logie Awards in Australia. The documentary explored historical dimensions of the relationship between surf culture and Australian cultural identity. \\"Bombora\\" is also the title of a popular music instrumental released in 1963 by Australian surf rock band The Atlantics.

The program gained impetus with the advent of the Vietnam War and was aided by advances in helicopter technology, specifically the development of the turboshaft engine. Three of the aircraft evaluated for the program would eventually enter military service, one as a training helicopter and two as observation helicopters used for battlefield reconnaissance missions.  History  In July 1953, the Office of Lieutenant General John E. Dahlquist, Chief, Army Field Forces (AFF), forwarded desirable military characteristics for a two-place reconnaissance helicopter to Army Headquarters. Nearly a year later, in May 1954, Dahlquist's office once again emphasized the need for replacement aircraft and recommended procurement of troop test quantities of the YH-32. Preliminary evaluation of the YH-32 design revealed that the aircraft was unsuitable for the mission, and the tests were canceled.Weinert 1991, p. 205. In 1955, the Army Field Forces were transformed into the Continental Army Command (CONARC). Dahlquist, who had been promoted to 4-star General on 18 August 1954, continued in command. On 11 October 1955, CONARC recommended that the Department of the Army initiate a program to develop a replacement observation helicopter for the aging OH-13 Sioux and OH-23 Raven. Army's Chief of Research and Development agreed to include the requirement for a new helicopter in the budget for fiscal year 1957 on 19 March 1956, after CONARC highlighted the continued lack of development for replacement aircraft.Weinert 1991, pp. 205-206. During the course of the next three years, three helicopters would be evaluated as candidates to replace the OH-13 and OH-23; the Sud-Ouest Djinn, the Hughes 269, and the Brantly B-2. The aircraft were designated the YHO-1 DJ, YHO-2 HU, and YHO-3 BR, respectively. By October 1958, service testing of Sud Aviation YHO-1 DJ was completed. The following year saw the completion of the desert and temperate temperature testing of the YHO-2 HU. The YHO-3 BR did not complete user testing after engineering evaluations revealed significant deficiencies. Service testing demonstrated that the YHO-2 had been the most capable, but due to a limited load capability, it was deemed not suitable to replace the OH-13.Weinert 1991, p. 206. = LOH = On 14 October 1960, the United States Navy Bureau of Weapons issued Technical Specification 153, a request for proposals (RFP) for a four-seat, turbine-powered, light observation helicopter capable of fulfilling various roles: personnel transport, escort and attack missions, casualty evacuation and observation.Apostolo 1984 25 aircraft manufacturers were solicited for the program on behalf of the Army Chief of Transportation. By January 1961, 12 manufacturers, including Cessna, Hughes Tool Co. Aircraft Division, Hiller Aircraft and Bell Helicopters, had responded with 19 designs.Remington, Steve. The Cessna CH-1 Helicopter . Collectair.com. Accessed on 30 June 2009.

Uncommon Aircraft 2006. 18 November 2005. Accessed on 19 September 2006. Hiller's Model 1100 was recommended by the Navy team and became the YHO-5 (later YOH-5), and Hughes' Model 369 was added to the competition and became the YHO-6 (later YOH-6). Each manufacturer submitted 5 test and evaluation prototypes of their designs to the Army for flight test evaluation at Camp Rucker, Alabama. As a result of the flight evaluation, Hiller's YOH-5 and Hughes' YOH-6 were selected to compete in a program cost analysis bid for the contract. The Hughes bid won the contract, although Hiller protested the contract award, and in 1965, the YOH-6 was redesignated as the OH-6A Cayuse. =LOH round 2= An OH-58 Kiowa, winner of the LOH competition's second round In 1967, the Army reopened the LOH competition for bids and Bell resubmitted for the program using their model 206A design. Fairchild-Hiller failed to resubmit their bid with the YOH-5A, which they had successfully marketed as the FH-1100. In the end, Bell won the contract and the model 206A was designated as the OH-58A. Following the Army's naming convention for its aircraft, the OH-58A was named Kiowa for the Native American tribe. References =Notes= =Bibliography= *Apostolo, Giorgio.

Ke applies most prominently to companies that regularly generate excess capital (free cash flow, cash on hand) from ongoing operations. Critically, in assessing a company's financial position (and reading its balance sheet), COE is distinguished from CAPEX, or costs associated with Capital Expenditures. Ke is most often used in the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), in which Ke = Rf + ß(Rm-Rf). In this equation, Ke (COE) equals the anticipated return from the difference (Beta) of investment yields from a return based on market expectations (Rm) and a Risk Free Rate (Rf), such as Treasury Bills or Bonds. *KIBOR - Karachi Interbank Offered Rate *KPI – Key Performance Indicator, a type of performance measurement.

GQ has called him ‘one of the worlds most in-demand portraitists’. He was educated at Westminster School. His unauthorised 2007 portrait of George W. Bush, created from cuttings of pornographic magazines brought him worldwide notoriety, shown in London, New York and Los Angeles. Yeo's 2016 mid-career survey at the Museum of National History at Frederiksborg Castlehttp://www.dnm.dk/UK/Jonathan_Yeo_-_Portraits.htm followed a retrospective at the National Portrait Gallery, London, in 2013http://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/display/2013/jonathan-yeo-portraits.php and the Lowry in Manchester in 2014. Yeo was the subject of a BBC Culture Show Special in September 2013.http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/n3csvkdc The monograph The Many Faces of Jonathan Yeo, featuring works from throughout his career, was published by London-based publisher Art / Books in the same month.http://www.artbookspublishing.co.uk/the-many-faces-of-jonathan-yeo/ His paintings are included within the permanent collections of the National Portrait Gallery, London, the Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle, The Museum of National History at Frederiksborg Castle in Denmark, and The Royal Collection. In February 2016, Yeo's portrait of the actor Kevin Spacey in the role of President Francis J. Underwood, from the Netflix series House of Cards, was unveiled at the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery in Washington, DC.http://npg.si.edu/exhibition/kevin-spacey-president-francis-j-underwood Spacey unveiled the painting in character as the fictional President Underwood, joking \\"I'm pleased the Smithsonian continues to prove itself as a worthwhile institution.

A new series of paintings of the actor and model Cara Delevingne was unveiled at the museum as part of the exhibition. This series of portraits was made over an eighteen-month period and is concerned with image making and performed identity. Yeo said: “the way we manipulate and read self-portrait images, or ‘selfies’, in the last five years has far more in common with the activity of the 16th-century portrait artists and audiences than any art movement since the birth of photography\\".https://www.telegraph.co.uk/art/artists/model-cara-delevingne-is- perfect-muse-says-artist-jonathan-yeo/ A portrait of the former Danish Prime Minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, was also unveiled at the opening of this exhibition and will remain at the museum as part if its permanent collection. A new monograph, titled ‘In The Flesh’, was published by the museum to accompany the show. Career Yeo taught himself to paint in his twenties while recovering from Hodgkin's Disease. In the early 2000s, he became known for his contemporary realist portraits of well-known figures. His subjects include actors Dennis Hopper, Jude Law, Kristin Scott Thomas, Lily Cole, Nicole Kidman, Turner Prize-winning artist Grayson Perry, Savile Row tailor Ozwald Boateng, the former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, The Duchess of Cornwall and media tycoon Rupert Murdoch.http://jonathanyeo.com/work/ In 2005, his portrait of Erin O'Connor was used to advertise London's National Portrait Gallery around the world. The painting was used as the front cover of ‘500 Portraits’, a survey of the BP Portrait prize published in 2011.http://www.widewalls.ch/artist-of-the-week- jonathan-yeo/ Yeo was commissioned by the House of Commons as the official Election Artist for the 2001 UK general election, and he painted the leaders of the three largest parties. His triptych of Tony Blair, William Hague, and Charles Kennedy, entitled, ‘Proportional Representation’, was made up of canvases sized according to the subjects' popularity. In January 2008, Yeo's official portrait of former Prime Minister Tony Blair was unveiled and struck a public chord with its clear Iraq war reference. It showed an older and wearier-looking Blair wearing a red poppy - a symbol of war remembrance for the British.Ben Hoyle, ‘Tony Blair is blooming, says painter who couldn’t keep Iraq out of the picture’, The Times, 19 January 2008. In line with the political subjects that have featured throughout his work, in 2009, Yeo painted a full-length portrait of David Cameron just before his election to Prime Minister, which was sold at auction in 2010 for £200,000.Tim Willis, 'Jonathan Yeo goes from porn to politics' , Evening Standard, 3 February 2010Becky Pugh, 'Do we ever like portraits of ourselves?', The Daily Telegraph, 3 February 2010 Between 2010 and 2012, Yeo created works based on cosmetic surgery procedures. He presents the faces of women in pre and post- operative states, as a counterpoint to the traditional portrait. This collection of paintings was the subject of two solo exhibitions, ‘You’re Only Young Twice’ at Lazarides in London and ‘(I’ve Got You) Under My Skin’ at Circle Culture Gallery in Berlin . ‘Jonathan Yeo Portraits’ at the National Portrait Gallery, London (2013-2014) included a selection of new and older works by Yeo.Jonathan Yeo (1970-), Artist, National Portrait Gallery. Retrieved 8 August 2012. The new portraits included individuals who have made a significant mark on their field of expertise, including: the arts, theatre, and politics. Sitters include Doreen Lawrence, Kevin Spacey, Damien Hirst, Malala Yousafzai, and Grayson Perry. In 2014, the exhibition was shown at The Lowry Gallery in Salford and in 2015, it was on display at the Museum of National History at Frederiksborg Castle in Denmark in honour of Yeo having painted the first official portrait of the former Danish Prime Minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt. Yeo is art consultant at Soho House group.'Artist-as-curator is the latest hip hotel amenity', Ralph Lauren Magazine, Volume II, Issue 2'For the Sake of Hotel Art: Dean Street Townhouse’s Naughty Wallpaper', HotelChatter.com, 16 August 2010 He has co-curated the clubs worldwide, and designed the now notorious, pornographic leaf wallpaper that adorns several of its walls, including the Dean Street Townhouse in London and Soho House, Berlin. Jonathan Yeo was a judge for the 2010 Art Fund Prize for museums . In 2014 Yeo was on the panel of judges for the BP Portrait Prize . In April 2011, the Queen commissioned Yeo to paint a portrait of David Attenborough for the Royal Collection.Richard Eden,'The Queen asks porn artist Jonathan Yeo to draw Sir David Attenborough', The Daily Telegraph, 3 April 2011 Controversy In 2003 Yeo presented a diptych full-frontal nude of the then ICA chairman, Ivan Massow, the entrepreneur and patron of the arts at the Royal Society of Portrait Painters. Yeo created an controversial portrait of George W Bush in 2007, entitled 'Bush', which gained worldwide attention. After a commission to paint the US president was reportedly awarded and then withdrawn, Yeo created an image of the President anyway, making a collaged portrait from pornography.’’Porn Bush’ Angers Republicans’, Der Spiegel, 30 August 2007 The work led to Yeo exhibiting more collages – mainly portraits and nudes – made in the same way. At the first of these exhibitions in 2008, Yeo presented 'Blue Period' at Lazarides Gallery, owned by Steve Lazarides, a specialist dealer in outsider and street art, known for launching Banksy' career. The show included the Bush porn portrait as well as new collages of Hugh Hefner and Lucian Freud. It was reported that the George Bush collage was seized by Israeli customs on the way to the Banksy-curated 'Santa's Ghetto' exhibition in Bethlehem in December 2007.’Yeo paints himself into a corner’, The Daily Telegraph, 22 December 2008 'Porn in the USA', Yeo's first US solo show, was staged by Lazarides, taking place in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, and was met by critical acclaim. Following on from the success of 'Bush' (2007), this exhibition included portraits of Tiger Woods and Sarah Palin created from pornographic collage cutouts.'Sarah Palin Memorialized By Jonathan Yeo's Porn Art', Huffington Post, 2 July 2010'Sarah Palin, Memorialized with Porn Art', Artinfo, 1 July 2010'Go See This: Temporary & Edgy Art Gallery in Beverly Hills Gets a Little Naughty', LAist, 9 July 2010 Yeo had two works involved in the dispute over the sale of the late Dennis Hopper's art collection. He was one of only three artists to have been commissioned by Hopper to paint his portrait, the other two being Andy Warhol and Julian Schnabel. Hopper described his work as 'timeless and exquisite'. Critical reception In his Guardian review of the Blair portrait, Jonathan Jones accuses Yeo and his subject of conspiring to manipulate the image of the former PM, claiming that, 'Blair is a tacit co-conspirator who walked in wearing the poppy, then sat as bleak as he looks here, in invitation to the artist to home in on that tell- tale paper flower.' Jonathan Jones, we forget: the war blemish’, The Guardian, 19 January 2008 Some commentators have suggested that, by making portraits and other work which poke fun at the politicians and celebrities they depict, he risks alienating the very people whom he used to paint very successfully. NPG director Sandy Nairne was reported as being concerned about Yeo pushing the porn collage theme too far saying 'the Bush collage was a riposte. And there was a certain logic in that riposte. What is more puzzling is what happens after that.' Rebecca Rose, 'The Shock of the Nude', The FT Magazine, 13 September 2008 Charles Saumarez-Smith, former Director of the National Gallery and Royal Academy, said of the porn-collage of Lucian Freud, 'Yeo is the young rising star of portraiture and Freud is the acknowledged master. It's a homage that has its tradition in the past. Painters would quite often do portraits of other artists they admired. Admittedly this one of Freud is rather different as Yeo has used this other dimension – people's private parts.' Richard Brooks, 'Portrait of Lucian Freud from Private Parts', The Sunday Times, 1 June 2008 At the launch of Yeo's National Portrait Gallery show, the Guardian described him as ‘one of the UK's most highly regarded portrait artists’, and GQ named him ‘one of the world's most in-demand portraitists’. Malala Yousafzai revealed she was touched that Yeo asked to paint her and ‘honoured’ that her picture would hang in the National Portrait Gallery. Personal life Yeo is the son of British politician Tim Yeo. He is married to the former actress and journalist Shebah Ronay. They live in London and have two daughters.

Barschel was found dead under mysterious circumstances on 11 October 1987, when his clothed body was discovered in a full bathtub at the Hotel Beau-Rivage in Geneva, Switzerland, shortly after he became embroiled in scandal during the 1987 federal election. While a police investigation concluded that Barschel had committed suicide, the circumstances of his death remain controversial.  Early life  Uwe Barschel and his siblings were raised by his grandparents in Börnsen, near Geesthacht; his mother worked as a seamstress and preferred to leave her children's upbringing to her parents. Barschel's father Heinrich, a mathematician, was believed to have been killed during the Battle of Berlin in April 1945. Barschel was described by his teachers and classmates in Geesthacht as calm, serious, ambitious, and career-conscious. In 1963, Barschel was among a group of Geesthacht students who attended a school assembly which featured former admiral and convicted war criminal Karl Dönitz, speaking at the invitation of a pro-Nazi history teacher. The event, during which Dönitz gave an apologia for Nazi ideology with no rebuttal from students and staff, caused a furore when it was reported by the German and international press.Die Dönitz-Affäre, Beitrag zum Geschichtswettbewerb des Bundespräsidenten 2010/2011 (pdf; 2,2 MB), sowie Flensburger Tageblatt, 7 December 2013 Seventeen years later, as Schleswig-Holstein's minister of the interior, Barschel attended Dönitz's funeral. Barschel studied public law, economics, political science and education at the University of Kiel. Upon graduating in 1971, he was admitted to the bar and began working as a lawyer and notary. In addition to his legal and political activities, Barschel also developed an interest in science. He was reportedly preparing to withdraw from politics in the middle of the 1987 legislative session, and had almost completed his habilitation thesis at the time of his death. In: Netzeitung. 2 October 2006. Uwe Barschel was married to Freya Barschel (née von Bismarck, 1947-), a distant relative of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. The couple raised their four children in the town of Mölln, where Barschel is buried. Barschel's headstone gives his date of death as 10 October at the request of his widow.  Political career  Barschel joined the Junge Union, the joint youth organisation of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU), in 1960. He became a member of the CDU two years later. In Schleswig-Holstein, Barschel was chairman of the Junge Union from 1967 to 1971 and deputy chairman of the CDU in 1969. Between 1970 and 1982, he served as chairman of the CDU's district association in, and sat on the district council of, the Duchy of Lauenburg. Barschel was a member of the Landtag in Schleswig- Holstein from 1971 until his death. On 1 January 1979, Barschel was appointed Minister of Finance by then-minister-president Gerhard Stoltenberg. On 1 July of the same year he took over the Ministry of the Interior and became one of the delegates from Schleswig-Holstein in the Bundesrat. As minister of the interior, Barschel faced what was at the time the largest demonstration of the anti-nuclear movement in West Germany, protesting the Brokdorf Nuclear Power Plant. Barschel chaired the Interior Ministers' Conference in 1981 and 1982, and chaired the Ministerial Conference in 1982 and 1983. In 1982, after Stoltenberg had been appointed Federal Finance Minister by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Barschel was elected the new minister-president in October 1982. Aged only 38, he was the youngest minister-president in Germany's postwar history. Under his leadership, the CDU defended their absolute majority at the state elections in 1983, winning the election with 49% of the vote to the Social Democratic Party's (SPD) 43.7%. Barschel was one of the founding members of the Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival, appearing at the inaugural event in 1986 to narrate a performance from Camille Saint-Saëns' Carnival of the Animals. On 31 May 1987, shortly before the start of the 1987 federal campaign, a plane carrying Barschel and his bodyguard crashed on approach at Lübeck Airport. Both of the pilots were killed in the crash, and Barschel's bodyguard succumbed to his injuries at hospital a few days later.Lūbecker Nachrichten: Flugzeugbrand auf dem Flugplatz Lübeck-Blankensee, 2 June 198731 Mai 1987 - Uwe Barschel überlebt einen Flugzeugabsturz: Unfall oder Attentat? Stichtag, WDR, 31 May 2012 Barschel himself survived the crash and was able to participate in the campaign.  Scandal  On 13 September 1987, the day before the election, the magazine Der Spiegel reported an account by Reiner Pfeiffer, Barschel's media adviser, that Barschel had ordered him to spy on the SPD's top candidate, Björn Engholm, with the aim of embarking on a smear campaign implicating Engholm in tax evasion. Pfeiffer further claimed to have been ordered to install a bugging device in Barschel's phone and accuse the SPD of being the perpetrators. The subsequent scandal became known as the \\"Barschel affair\\", or Waterkant-Gate (an allusion to the Watergate scandal, with Waterkant (from Low German \\"waterside\\"). As a result of the unfolding scandal, the CDU saw its absolute majority in Schleswig-Holstein reduced to 42.6% while the SPD's vote rose to 45.2%. The CDU managed to start coalition talks with the Free Democratic Party (FDP), which refused to negotiate with Barschel. On 18 September, five days after the election, Barschel denied all accusations and made the following statement to the press: \\"I give you my word of honour, I repeat: my word of honour, that the charges brought against me are unfounded.\\" Under increasing pressure, Barschel resigned as minister- president on 2 October. In 1993, it emerged that Engholm had been aware of Pfeiffer's activities and that an SPD official had paid Pfeiffer DM50,000 to delay bringing his story to Der Spiegel for several weeks, thus presenting Engholm as a victim while negatively impacting the CDU's performance in the 1987 election. Engholm was convicted of lying to the first investigative committee into the Barschel affair and was forced to resign as minister- president. Neither that first inquiry nor the second, convened in 1995, found Pfeiffer to be a credible witness or was able to determine Barschel's guilt. Death On 8 October 1987, Barschel visited a travel agency in Gran Canaria to inquire about taking a flight to Zurich, Switzerland, where he was purportedly planning to meet someone. Finding that the flight was fully booked, Barschel took different connecting flights to Geneva, Frankfurt and Hamburg. Barschel's widow Freya later told an interviewer from the newspaper Die Welt that Barschel had been in contact with an informant who had promised to give him exculpatory evidence ahead of a parliamentary inquiry in Schleswig-Holstein into the Waterkant scandal. Freya reported that her husband contacted her from the Hotel Beau-Rivage in Geneva, telling her that he had met this informant at the airport. On 11 October, the day before his scheduled testimony in Schleswig-Holstein, Barschel was found dead by journalist Sebastian Knauer and photographer Hanns-Jörg Anders, of the German magazine Stern, in the bathroom of Room 317 at the Beau-Rivage. His body was fully dressed and lying in a bathtub filled with water. Barschel's autopsy uncovered a total of eight drugs in his system, including the sedatives lorazepam, diazepam, diphenhydramine, and perazine, along with the barbiturate cyclobarbitone and the sleep aid pyrithyldione. The Geneva prosecutor determined that Barschel's death was self-inflicted, and that he overdosed on these medications before stepping into the bath. This method of suicide corresponded with a guide published by a German right to die advocacy group. However, Barschel's widow and four children did not agree with this interpretation of the facts, and were convinced that he was actually murdered. =Alternative theories around Barschel's death= In his book By way of deception, former Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky nourishes suspicions that Barschel was killed by Israeli assassins, claiming Barschel had too much inside knowledge about an Israeli-Iranian arms deal. In the 1994 book, The Other Side of Deception: A Rogue Agent Exposes the Mossad's Secret Agenda, Ostrovsky claimed that a team of Israeli assassins had murdered Barschel through poisoning. The BND provided the telephone number for the Mossad agent to lure Barschel to the hotel. Ostrovsky described how Barschel was lured to Geneva's Beau-Rivage Hotel by a telephone call received in October 1987 in the Canary Islands from a person called Robert Oleff who was a Mossad agent. He met a man who was a Mossad agent in the hotel restaurant. He was provided a glass of wine which contained a sedative. Uwe Barschel left for his room and fell unconscious. According to Ostrovsky, the Mossad assassins broke into the room and inserted a feeding tube down Barschel's throat. They forced barbiturates and poisons down his throat through a tube. They also inserted a fever-inducing toxin suppository (believed to be bacterial endotoxins) into the victim's rectum and waited for a fever to develop. Once the fever developed, Barschel was placed in the ice-cold water which shocked his body making his heart stop. Ostrovsky states that the BND was cooperating with the Mossad in the transfer of weapons to Iran and also in the secret training of Iranian pilots that was occurring on German airbases during the 1980s. The goal was to make Iran and Iraq bleed each other to death which made Iran and Iraq weak and forced these countries to slash oil prices which boosted Western economic growth in the 1980s. Various mysteries around Barschel's death are discussed in a January 1995 Washington Post article based on German, Spanish and Swiss police investigations of the murder, and the possible motives for it. The article reported that the Barschel case had been reopened as a murder investigation because of evidence of third-party involvement. \\"Just who the third party who went to such lengths to make a murder look like a suicide might be, is unclear,\\" Andrew I. Killgore, publisher of the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, wrote in 1995. Although the Israeli government issued a \\"formal denial\\" that it was involved, such a denial, according to Killgore, especially if it is \\"formal,\\" is widely accepted in the region as confirmation that the opposite is true. According to Ostrovsky, Barschel was murdered because he refused to allow Israeli arms for Iran to be shipped from Schleswig-Holstein ports. During the Iran-Iraq war, Israel and the United States secretly armed Iran; the US had an interest in doing so both to create an \\"autonomous\\" source of unmonitored revenue with which to finance the Contras and other right-wing death squad-type organizations in Central America without hindrances from Congress and to obtain bargaining chips with Hezbollah (whom Iran had influence over) which at the time had several US hostages in Lebanon. Israel had an interest in arming Iran to keep Saddam Hussein busy; Iran inherited a vast arsenal of US weapons from its Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Israel with its large collection of US weapons was in a prime position to sell HAWK SAMs, M-60 tank spare parts, F-4 Phantom parts and air- to-air missiles to Tehran. In addition, the police investigation found indications that another person had been in Barschel's room at the time of his death. The official autopsy found some traces of force having been applied. 2011 Barschel case review On 12 June 2011 the Public Prosecution Department of Lübeck announced that the Barschel case would be re-opened and re-examined, with more sophisticated techniques such as DNA profiling being employed to find out the actual circumstances of the politician's demise.

Two different games were released in 1996 and 1997 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, by different publishers, in different regions. A third game was released for the 3DO (the final release for that system), Sega Saturn, PlayStation, and Game Boy Color, published by Interplay Productions. There was also a Game Boy game and a PlayStation sequel, Casper: Friends Around the World. There was going to be a 32X version of the game but it was later cancelled for unknown reasons. Windows/Macintosh game The first PC game based on the film was the Casper Brainy Book which was developed by Knowledge Adventure and was released in May 1996. It was aimed at children aged 4–8 and is an Interactive storybook, similar in style to Disney's Animated Storybooks, in which players read and play in the story and there are three mini-games, Fatso's Creature Feature, Stretch's Shake Rattle and Roll and Stinkie's Peek-a-boo, designed to teach vocabulary, spelling and shape recognition. Being aimed at younger children some of the darker elements of the story are cut with Carrigan, Dibs and Amelia absent, Dr. Harvey's career is to hunt for ghosts and the Lazarus being named simply as the \\"Machine\\" and was described as turning a ghost into a person. Although Carrigan and Dibs are cut from the story they appear in the hard jigsaw puzzles, among stills from the film, in Fatso's Creature Feature. Super Nintendo Entertainment System game Casper is a game developed by Absolute Entertainment and published by Natsume for the Super NES. The player controls Casper who is followed by Kat Harvey, and he has to protect her from any danger. Being a ghost Casper can pass through walls and other obstacles, unlike in most other Casper games, but he can't go away from Kat too much or else Carrigan's ghost will abduct her. The game follows loosely the plot of the movie. This game uses a revised Absolute A Boy and His Blob engine. Picking up special objects allows Casper to morph into these objects to clear rooms of enemies, and to protect Kat from certain hazards. Mirrors placed throughout the game allows Casper and Kat travel to other parts of mansion, and outside electrical lines allow Casper to pick up the last of the toys when he picks up the electric bolt morph. Super Famicom game Developed by Natsume, this was released only in Japan by the anime company KSS. In this version, the game uses an isometric view and the player mostly controls Kat Harvey as she protects Casper from the duo of Carrigan Crittenden and Dibs though Casper can be controlled occasionally after finding special pick-ups. During the course of the game, Kat collects items, therefore making this game an adventure game as opposed to an action game. Baseballs are used to stun the enemies. Getting hit by an enemy results in a game over. There is even a box to the bottom right that keeps track of time (in seconds and minutes); the game starts with ten seconds elapsed. Saving the game is performed by finding mechanical contraptions and activating them. While saving the game, the game counts all the coins and gems; it uses that count to tabulate a percentage to decide how much of the game has been officially completed. Sega Saturn, 3DO, PlayStation, and Game Boy Color game The version published by Interplay plays as a top-view action-adventure game with pre-rendered graphics. The game consists of three acts, first finding tokens of friendship for Kat and Dr. Harvey, then finding the pieces for the Lazarus machine (which Casper's uncles had disassembled to prevent him from using it), and finally finding the Cellular Integrator (which Carrigan's ghost steals, leading Casper to her lair) while exploring the mansion, collecting jigsaw pieces to solve puzzles for morph icons, eating food for morph points and dealing with the Ghostly Trio. Unlike other versions, other than the Ghostly Trio and Carrigan (who serves as this version's final boss), there are no enemies. The game instead focuses mainly on solving puzzles. The Game Boy Color game is a scaled-down version of the Saturn/3DO/PS game with the only puzzles and morph icons being the ones required to reach the ending and the sound and graphics are rendered for handheld. Game Boy game This game was developed by Bonsai Entertainment and released by Natsume. Each of the levels consist of four main mini games, which the player can do in any order, and two final mini games that only appear at the end of the game. However, three of the main mini games are the same every level, with their only difference being a slightly increased difficulty level. The main goal of these games are to make it to the end with as much ooze as possible (ooze being fuel for the Lazarus and is much like points).  Windows 95/98 game  Casper: The Interactive Adventure is a Point and click adventure CD-ROM game made by WizardWorks and Morning Star Multimedia in 1997 and takes place after the 1995 film. After the Harvey's go on vacation, Casper's human friends throw him a party to cheer him up but a revived Carrigan turns them into ghosts, using a magic spell from an old book in the library, and hides them somewhere in the manor as revenge for being tricked out of the ultimate treasure. The player must use various items to travel around Whipstaff to find traces of Casper's friends and take pictures of them for hints and collect items while defending against attacks by the Ghostly Trio who are on Carrigan's side. There was supposed to be a sequel as stated in the ending and the manual where the player would help Casper turn his friends back into \\"fleshies\\" but Morning Star went bankrupt before it was made.  Game Boy Advance game  Made by Microïds and Planet Interactive in 2002 it is one of few video games in which Casper can actually go through walls though only through the ones within each level. The Ghostly Trio have turned all the adults in town (presumably Friendship, Maine) into zombies leaving the children scared at the mercy of the Trio. The old Schoolmistress of the manor has them call in Dr. James Harvey to stop them only to become a zombie himself capable only of walking in front of him. It's up to Casper to help safely guide him through each of five levels using various transformations and objects to help the zombie Doctor collect flasks with the formula to cure him. There also six children in each level to rescue though the player does not need to in order to finish a level. However, Casper needs to save every child to become Hero of the Day. The Ghostly Trio show up in each level occasionally to scare Dr. Harvey and throw him off course and Casper must deflect their attacks. Development Silicon Graphics workstations using Alias software were used to generate the character graphics and backgrounds in the Saturn/PlayStation/3DO game. Reception Reviewing the 3DO version, Electronic Gaming Monthlys team of four reviewers criticized that load times are frequent, it is easy to get lost, and that the puzzles are often obscure or even don't make sense. They nonetheless had a generally positive response to the game, with Sushi-X deeming it a strong last hurrah for the 3DO. They cited the stunning graphics and wide variety of gameplay elements. A critic for Next Generation agreed that the graphics are exceptional, noting in particular the ghosts which have true transparency. While also agreeing that some of the puzzles don't make sense, he felt the game was generally easy enough for its young target audience, and concluded it to be a solid though not amazing game. The magazine's brief reviews of the PlayStation and Saturn versions made similar comments. Sega Saturn Magazine gave the Saturn version a 70%, calling it \\"a decent enough effort with what is a particularly sugary film, spoilt by some frustrating flaws in the gameplay and action that is too repetitive.\\" Their next issue printed a retraction, admitting that Interplay had not sent them a review copy of Casper, and that the review was actually based on an unfinished version of the game.

Goode was a member of Harriott's innovatory jazz quintet throughout its eight-year existence as a regular unit (1958–65). Goode was also involved with the saxophonist's later pioneering blend of jazz and Indian music in Indo-Jazz Fusions, the group Harriott co-led with composer/violinist John Mayer. Biography Goode was born in Kingston, Jamaica. His father was a choirmaster and organist who promoted classical choral music in Jamaica and his mother sang in the choir. As Goode recalled: \\"My name comes from my father putting on a performance of Samuel Coleridge Taylor’s Hiawatha’s Wedding Feast as a tribute to him.... I was born a year after.\\"\\"Coleridge Goode - Double Bass\\" , Jazzwise, 4 October 2007.\\"Coleridge Goode, double-bass player - obituary\\", The Telegraph, 15 October 2015. Goode came to Britain in 1934 as a 19-year-old student at the Royal Technical College in Glasgow (later the University of Strathclyde), and then went on to read for a degree in engineering at Glasgow University. He was already proficient as an amateur classical violinist but turned to jazz and took up the bass after hearing the music of such stars as Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday and Louis Jordan. Abandoning his plans to return to Jamaica to work as an engineer, Goode decided to embark upon a musical career. Martin Taylor (left) and Coleridge Goode in London, 2002, at the launch of the Stéphane Grappelli DVD A Life in the Jazz Century His primary early influences as a bassist were Walter Page, Slam Stewart and Jimmy Blanton. Moving to London in 1942, Goode subsequently worked with Johnny Claes, Eric Winstone, Lauderic Caton and Dick Katz, became a founder member of the Ray Ellington Quartet and recorded with Django Reinhardt in 1946, alongside Stephane Grappelli.John Stevenson, \\"Coleridge Goode obituary\\", The Guardian, 11 October 2015. Later Goode played in Tito Burns' sextet and led his own group, before being invited to join Harriott's new band in 1958. In 1967 he recorded with Chris McGregor, Dudu Pukwana, Ronnie Beer, and Laurie Allan on Gwigwi Mrwebi's Mbaqanga Songs. During the 1960s and 1970s, Goode worked extensively with pianist/composer Michael Garrick. Goode was still performing in the house band at Laurie Morgan's Sunday jam sessions at the King's Head in Crouch End into his 90s.\\"Coleridge Goode\\" , The Jazz Site. One of the finest jazz bassists who has worked in Europe, Goode is an important link to a proud heritage of Caribbean contributions to the music. His achievements through a long career have been an important inspiration for some leading contemporary black British jazz musicians. In 2002, his autobiography Bass Lines: A Life in Jazz, co-authored with his friend, the academic and jazz writer Roger Cotterrell, not only told his own story but provided poignant and vivid memories of the brilliant and tragic Harriott and of the birth of free form jazz in Britain.John Stevenson, \\"Coleridge Goode: Bassist and singer who played with Grappelli and Reinhardt\\", The Independent, 23 October 2015.

With the outbreak of the American Civil War, the northwestern state of Wisconsin raised 91,379 soldiers for the Union Army, organized into 53 infantry regiments, 4 cavalry regiments, a company of Berdan's sharpshooters, 13 light artillery batteries and 1 unit of heavy artillery. Most of the Wisconsin troops served in the Western Theater, although several regiments served in Eastern armies, including three regiments within the famed Iron Brigade. 3,794 were killed in action or mortally wounded, 8,022 died of disease, and 400 were killed in accidents. The total mortality was 12,216 men, about 13.4 percent of total enlistments.\\"Wisconsin in the War of the Rebellion\\" in J. D. Beck (ed.) The Blue Book of the State of Wisconsin. Madison: Democrat Printing Company, 1907, pp. 822-823. Soldiers Approximately 1 in 9 residents (regardless of age, sex or qualification for service) served in the army, and, in turn, half the eligible voters served. Wisconsin was the only state to organize replacements for troops that had already been fielded, leading northern generals to prefer having some regiments from the state under their command if possible. A number of Wisconsin regiments were distinguished, including three that served in the celebrated \\"Iron Brigade\\"-- the 2nd Wisconsin, 6th Wisconsin, and 7th Wisconsin. All were noted for their hard fighting and dashing appearance, being among the only troops in the Army of the Potomac to wear Hardee hats and long frock coats. They suffered severely at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. The 8th Wisconsin, another hard-fighting regiment, was often accompanied into battle by its mascot, Old Abe, a bald eagle. In a January 1863 letter to his sister, Union soldier Chauncey Herbert Cooke, a private from Company G of the 25th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment, gave his reasons for fighting for the Union in the war, stating that \\"I have no heart in this war if the slaves cannot go free.\\" Women during the war While men were fighting, many women needed to learn how to farm and do other manual labor. Besides having to tend to the home and children while the men were away at war, women also contributed supplies. Quilts and blankets were often given to soldiers. Some had encouraging messages sewn on them. One quilt that was made in 1864 by a group of women in Green Bay had the following poem: Other items women often sent included: shirts, sheets, pillows, pillowcases, coats, vests, trousers, towels, handkerchiefs, socks, bandages, canned fruits, dried fruits, butter, cheese, wine, eggs, pickles, books, and magazines. At one point, after the Battle of Resaca, women sent every wounded man within a certain distance a fresh orange or lemon. These fruits were to quench the strong thirst that was known to accompany a wound.Hurn, Ethel Alice. Wisconsin Women in the War between the States.

She was a daughter of Rahy, who also sired 2001 European Horse of the Year Fantastic Light, Noverre, Champion 3-Year-Old in England, U.S. Racing Hall of Fame member Serena's Song and Dreaming of Anna, the 2006 American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly and Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies winner. Mariah's Storm's grandsire was the important Blushing Groom, and her damsire was Epsom Derby winner Roberto. Mariah's Storm was trained by the father and son team of Don Von Hemel and Donnie K.. The father won the 1994 Ak-Sar-Ben Oaks and the 1995 Falls City Handicap with her and the son the 1993 Arlington-Washington Lassie Stakes, 1994 Arlington Heights Oaks, and in 1995 the Arlington Matron Handicap and the Turfway Park Budweiser Breeders' Cup Stakes. In 1993, Mariah's Storm was working on building points to qualify for a chance to run in that fall's Breeders' Cup when she fractured her front left cannon bone while running in the Alcibiades Stakes at Keeneland Race Course. When a horse injures her cannon bone, it usually ends her racing career. However, Mariah's Storm's owners and trainers refused to give up hope and with the work of several skilled veterinarians, the fractured cannon bone healed and strengthened. Full Recovery In September 1993, before the injury occurred, Mariah's Storm won the Arlington-Washington Lassie Stakes at Chicago's Arlington Park. This was a Grade III stakes for two-year-old- fillies. After her injury healed and she fully recovered, she made a return to racing in 1994 and won the Arlington Oaks. In 1995, she won the Arlington Matron Stakes. Since her record of winning all three stakes races at Arlington Park was a rare accomplishment, Arlington officials named the Mariah's Storm Stakes in her honor. Racing at age four, in September 1995 Mariah's Storm won the Turfway Breeders' Cup Stakes at Turfway Park, defeating future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame filly Serena's Song, also a daughter of Rahy. She then won the Falls City Handicap at Churchill Downs and competed in the Breeders' Cup Distaff, where she finished ninth in a ten-horse field. Produce Record Mariah's Storm made her mark on the racing industry as a broodmare, producing the great Giant's Causeway (by Storm Cat), the European Horse of the Year for 2000. She also produced Freud, a full brother to Giant's Causeway who stands at Sequel Stallions New York. Freud was the leading sire in New York in 2008., She has also produced significant mares: her first filly, a full sister to Giant's Causeway named You'resothrilling, produced four-time Group 1 winner Gleneagles and Irish 1,000 Guineas winner Marvellous. Mariah's Storm also produced a Sadler's Wells filly named Love Me Only that is the dam of Storm the Stars (by Sea the Stars), winner of the Group 2 Great Voltigeur Stakes and placed in multiple Group 1 races. Mariah's Storm produced six colts in a row from 1997 to 2002, followed by seven fillies from 2005 to 2015. In the Media The movie Dreamer (2005 film) was loosely based on the story of Mariah's Storm. However, in the movie, Soñador (the horse based on Mariah's Storm) won the Breeders' Cup Classic (as the fifth filly ever to participate in that race), whereas in real life, Mariah's Storm ran in the Breeders' Cup Distaff and finished ninth of ten.,  Pedigree  See also *Dreamer: Inspired by a True Story * Giant's Causeway (horse)  References  Category:1991 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Kentucky Category:Racehorses trained in the United States Category:Thoroughbred family 11 ","title":"Mariah's Storm"},{"id":"9484467","text":"Claudia Felicitas of Austria (30 May 1653 – 8 April 1676) was by birth an Archduchess of Austria and by marriage Holy Roman Empress, German Queen, Archduchess consort of Austria, Queen consort of Hungary and Bohemia as the second wife of Leopold I.Leopold I in: www.britannica.com [retrieved 10 November 2016]. A member of the Third Order of Saint Dominic, she had a beautiful singing voice and composed music, and also was passionately fond of hunting. Claudia Felicitas had a great influence on her husband; thanks to her, all her political opponents were removed from court. She also struggled with the abuse of the executive and judicial systems. During her 3-year-long marriage, she gave birth to two children who died in infancy; she died after the birth of her second child. The Tyrolean branch of the House of Habsburg became extinct upon her death. Life =Early years= Claudia Felicitas was born in Florence on 30 May 1653.Korotin 2016, p. 509.Czeike 1992, p. 508. She was the first child and eldest daughter of Ferdinand Charles, Archduke of Further Austria and Count of Tyrol, by his wife and first-cousin Anna de' Medici. On her father's side, her grandparents were Leopold V, Archduke of Further Austria and his wife Claudia de' Medici (after which she received her first name); on her mother's side, her grandparents were Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and his wife Archduchess Maria Magdalena of Austria. Her parents failed to produce a male heir: after Claudia Felicitas, they had only two other daughters, one who died immediately after birth (19 July 1654) and Maria Magdalena (17 August 1656 – 21 January 1669).Seel 1817, p. 323. After Archduke Ferdinand Charles died in 1662, he was succeeded by his brother Sigismund Francis, who died three years later (1665), a few days after his marriage by proxy with Hedwig of the Palatinate-Sulzbach. In consequence, Claudia Felicitas and her younger sister became the last members of the Tyrolean branch of the House of Habsburg.Gottardi 1843, pp. 247–248. Some sources described her as \\"a very beautiful girl, with a lively character and developed intellect\\".Coxe 1824, p. 309. The princess grew up at court in Innsbruck, which thanks to her parents became one of the centers of European baroque art and music. She had an excellent singing voice, played various instruments and also composed music.Koldau 2007, p. 106. However, the great enthusiasm of the princess was hunting; in the preserved portrait by Giovanni Maria Morandi, the 13-year-old Claudia Felicitas was depicted in the image of Diana, the ancient goddess of hunting.Laura Mocci: Giovanni Maria Morandi - Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 76 (2012) in: www.treccani.it [retrieved 9 November 2016]. However, she didn't forget the customary pious activities, being a secular member of the Third Order of Saint Dominic.Dominikanische Laiengemeinschaften in: dominikanische-laien.de [retrieved 9 November 2016]. =Marriage and children= After the extinction of the Tyrolean branch of the House of Habsburg in 1665, Further Austria and the County of Tyrol came under the direct control of Emperor Leopold I. Anna de' Medici tried to protect the rights of her daughters. The dispute with the imperial court ended only after the wedding of her eldest daughter with the Emperor; after her marriage, Claudia Felicitas retained the title of Countess of Tyrol.Gottardi 1843, p. 248. From his first marriage with Infanta Margaret Theresa of Spain, Leopold I had four children (including two sons), but all except the eldest daughter, Archduchess Maria Antonia, died shortly after birth. He was the last of the male Habsburgs, besides the sickly King Charles II of Spain, and thus was in dire need of a male heir;Wheatcroft 1995, pp. 200–201. so shortly after his first wife's death (12 March 1673), the Emperor (despite his deep mourning) was forced to start looking for a new wife and opted for Claudia Felicitas, his second cousin (both being great-grandchildren of Charles II, Archduke of Inner Austria),Antonio Chiusole: La genealogia delle cose piu illustri di tutto il mondo, principiando da Adamo nostro primo Padre, e continuando sino al tempo presente, p. 237, Venezia: ed. Giambattista Recurti, 1743 — 669 p. who also could bring to him her possible rights over the Tyrol. The princess, with the consent of her relatives, immediately agreed with the proposal, rejecting other suitors of her hand, including the widower James, Duke of York and future King of England and Scotland.Coxe 1824, p. 308. However, and despite that his new bride was young, attractive, and apparently aware of the great status it implied to be Holy Roman Empress, Leopold I still lamented that she was \\"not like my only Margareta\\".Wheatcroft 1995, p. 201. The proxy marriage took place in Innsbruck, and the bride received a dowry of 30,000 guilders.John and Charles Mozley: Traditions of Tyrol in: The Monthly Packet of Evening Readings for Members of the English Church, London 1870, vol. IX, p. 303. Then she, with her mother and cortege, traveled to Graz, where the official wedding was scheduled to be celebrated. By command of the Emperor, Prince Johann Seyfried von Eggenberg was in charge of the celebrations. Above the main portal in his newly built and magnificent palace, where the day before the wedding, the future Empress stopped with her entourage, he ordered to be written the inscription in Latin \\"Long live Empress Claudia!\\" (Latin: Ave Claudia Imperatrix). The wedding was held at Graz Cathedral on 15 October 1673, and the celebrations for this event lasted two weeks. On 3 November, the Imperial couple went from Graz to Vienna.Kaiserhochzeit 1673 in: www.museum-joanneum.at [retrieved 10 November 2016]. During her marriage, Claudia Felicitas gave birth to two daughters, who died in childhood: Theodor Berger: Die Durchläuchtige Welt, Oder: Kurtzgefaßte Genealogische ..., Vol. 1 [retrieved 10 November 2016]. *Anna Maria Josepha Theresia Antonia Dominica Xaveria Dorothea (11 September 1674 – 22 December 1674), Archduchess of Austria. *Maria Josepha Clementina Anna Gabriella Antonia Franziska Dominica Theresia Eva Placidia (11 October 1675 – 11 July 1676), Archduchess of Austria. =Holy Roman Empress and German Queen= Despite the failure to produce the needed male heir, Claudia Felicitas enjoyed a happy marriage and had great influence over her husband. She achieved the resignation and exile of the Minister Prince Václav Eusebius František of Lobkowicz, who was against her marriage with the Emperor and favored the choice of Countess Palatine Eleonore Magdalene of Neuburg as Leopold I's new wife when he became a widower;Gustav Bock: Neue berliner Musikzeitung, p. 34, Berlin: Ed. Bole und G. Bock ed. 1852, Vol. VI — 407 p. [retrieved 10 November 2016]. this was also the opinion of Dowager Empress Eleonora Gonzaga (Leopold I's stepmother), and in consequence she and Claudia Felicitas didn't have a good relationship. The Empress drew attention to the abuses of her husband and the imperial court, especially in the government and judicial affairs. To this end, in 1674 it supplied the opera with a corresponding implication.Koldau 2005, p. 107. =Death= Claudia Felicitas suddenly died of tuberculosis in Vienna on 8 April 1676, aged 22, after the birth of her second (and only surviving) daughter. She was buried in the Dominican Church, and her heart was put in a special urn and placed in the Imperial Crypt. Three months later, her daughter died, and in September her mother the Dowager Countess of Tyrol also died; she was buried next to her.HABSBURG EMPERORS OF AUSTRIA in: www.royaltyguide.nl [retrieved 10 November 2016].

The central question for classical pluralism is how power and influence are distributed in a political process. Groups of individuals try to maximize their interests. Lines of conflict are multiple and shifting as power is a continuous bargaining process between competing groups. There may be inequalities but they tend to be distributed and evened out by the various forms and distributions of resources throughout a population. Any change under this view will be slow and incremental, as groups have different interests and may act as \\"veto groups\\" to destroy legislation. The existence of diverse and competing interests is the basis for a democratic equilibrium,Held, David, Models of Democracy and is crucial for the obtaining of goals by individuals. A polyarchy—a situation of open competition for electoral support within a significant part of the adult population—ensures competition of group interests and relative equality. Pluralists stress civil rights, such as freedom of expression and organization, and an electoral system with at least two parties. On the other hand, since the participants in this process constitute only a tiny fraction of the populace, the public acts mainly as bystanders. This is not necessarily undesirable for two reasons: (1) it may be representative of a population content with the political happenings, or (2) political issues require continuous and expert attention, which the average citizen may not have. Important theorists of pluralism include Robert A. Dahl (who wrote the seminal pluralist work, Who Governs?), David Truman, and Seymour Martin Lipset. Pluralist conception of power The list of possible sources of power is virtually endless: legal authority, money, prestige, skill, knowledge, charisma, legitimacy, free time, and experience. Pluralists also stress the differences between potential and actual power as it stands. Actual power means the ability to compel someone to do something and is the view of power as a causation. Dahl describes power as a \\"realistic relationship, such as A's capacity for acting in such a manner as to control B's responses\\". Potential power refers to the possibility of turning resources into actual power. Cash, one of many resources, is only a stack of bills until it is put to work. Malcolm X, for example, was certainly not a rich person growing up, but received money from many groups after his prison term and used other resources such as his forceful personality and organizational skills. He had a greater impact on American politics than most wealthy people. A particular resource like money cannot automatically be equated with power because the resource can be used skillfully or clumsily, fully or partially, or not at all. Pluralists believe that social heterogeneity prevents any single group from gaining dominance. In their view, politics is essentially a matter of aggregating preferences. This means that coalitions are inherently unstable (Polsby, 1980), hence competition is easily preserved. In Dahl's because \\"political heterogeneity follows socioeconomic heterogeneity\\", social differentiation increasingly disperses power. In this case, Hamed Kazemzadeh, Canadian Pluralist argues that organizational membership socializes individuals to demo cratic norms, increases participation and moderates the politics of society so that bargaining and negotiation are possible. Hamed Kazemzadeh, Democratic platform in Social Pluralism The pluralist approach to the study of power, states that nothing categorical about power can be assumed in any community. The question then is not who runs a community, but if any group in fact does. To determine this, pluralists study specific outcomes. The reason for this is that they believe human behavior is governed in large part by inertia. That said, actual involvement in overt activity is a more valid marker of leadership than simply a reputation. Pluralists also believe that there is no one particular issue or point in time at which any group must assert itself to stay true to its own expressed values, but rather that there are a variety of issues and points at which this is possible. There are also costs involved in taking action at all not only losing, but expenditure of time and effort. While a structuralist may argue that power distributions have a rather permanent nature, this rationale says that power may in fact be tied to issues, which vary widely in duration. Also, instead of focusing on actors within a system, the emphasis is on the leadership roles itself. By studying these, it can be determined to what extent there is a power structure present in a society. Three of the major tenets of the pluralist school are (1) resources and hence potential power are widely scattered throughout society; (2) at least some resources are available to nearly everyone; and (3) at any time the amount of potential power exceeds the amount of actual power. Finally, and perhaps most important, no one is all-powerful unless proven so through empirical observation. An individual or group that is influential in one realm may be weak in another. Large military contractors certainly throw their weight around on defense matters, but how much sway do they have on agricultural or health policies? A measure of power, therefore, is its scope, or the range of areas where it is successfully applied as observed by a researcher. Pluralists believe that with few exceptions power holders usually have a relatively limited scope of influence. Pluralism does leave room for an elitist situation- Should a group A continuously exert power over multiple groups. For a pluralist to accept this notion, it must be empirically observed and not assumed so by definition. For all these reasons power cannot be taken for granted. One has to observe it empirically in order to know who really governs. The best way to do this, pluralists believe, is to examine a wide range of specific decisions, noting who took which side and who ultimately won and lost. Only by keeping score on a variety of controversies can one begin to identify actual power holders. Pluralism was associated with behavioralism.Pluralism A contradiction to pluralist power is often cited from the origin of one's power. Although certain groups may share power, people within those groups set agendas, decide issues, and take on leadership roles through their own qualities. Some theorists argue that these qualities cannot be transferred, thus creating a system where elitism still exists. What this theory fails to take into account is the prospect of overcoming these qualities by garnering support from other groups. By aggregating power with other organizations, interest groups can over-power these non-transferable qualities. In this sense, political pluralism still applies to these aspects. Elite pluralism Elite pluralists agree with classical pluralists that there is \\"plurality\\" of power; however, this plurality is not \\"pure\\" as some people and groups have more power than others. For example, some people have more money than others, so they can pay to have their opinion put across better (i.e. more advertising) than the working class can. This inequality is because society has \\"elites\\"; people who have more power, perhaps through money, inheritance or social tradition than others.Schattschneider, E.E. 1960. The Semi-Sovereign People. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, p. 35. Basically, it claims that elites play a big role in decision making. The idea behind reads as follow: in democracies the people participate in electing the elites who will represent them and, at the end, the ones who are going to make the laws. As Davita S. Glasberg and Deric Shannon highlights, \\"political elites are not a monoholitic, unified interest group representing their own narrow group of interests but rather are diverse, competitive elites representing a wide range of interests\\". They have to compete in \\"the political market place\\" in order to gain voters being the power equally distributed between all the potential voters. Moreover, the stability in the system is achieved through this competition among the elites, as they have to negotiate in order to pass a bill. And, sometimes, they have to change their positions and points of view in order to reach a common point. Elites respect and follow the policy-making procedures because they are accountable of their acts and they can be replaced through legal procedures of through new elections. Neo-pluralism While Pluralism as a political theory of the state and policy formation gained its most traction during the 1950s and 1960s in America, some scholars argued that the theory was too simplistic (see Connolly (1969) The Challenge to Pluralist Theory) leading to the formulation of neo-pluralism. Views differed about the division of power in democratic society. Although neo-pluralism sees multiple pressure groups competing over political influence, the political agenda is biased towards corporate power. Neo-pluralism no longer sees the state as an umpire mediating and adjudicating between the demands of different interest groups, but as a relatively autonomous actor (with different departments) that forges and looks after its own (sectional) interests. Constitutional rules, which in pluralism are embedded in a supportive political culture, should be seen in the context of a diverse, and not necessarily supportive, political culture and a system of radically uneven economic sources. This diverse culture exists because of an uneven distribution of socioeconomic power. This creates possibilities for some groups while limiting others in their political options. In the international realm, order is distorted by powerful multinational interests and dominant states, while in classical pluralism emphasis is put on stability by a framework of pluralist rules and free market society. =Charles Lindblom= Charles E. Lindblom, who is seen as positing a strong neo- pluralist argument, still attributed primacy to the competition between interest groups in the policy process but recognized the disproportionate influence business interests have in the policy process. =Corporatism= Classical pluralism was criticized as it did not seem to apply to Westminster- style democracies or the European context. This led to the development of corporatist theories. Corporatism is the idea that a few select interest groups are actually (often formally) involved in the policy formulation process, to the exclusion of the myriad other 'interest groups'. For example, trade unions and major sectoral business associations are often consulted about (if not the drivers of) specific policies. These policies often concern tripartite relations between workers, employers and the state, with a coordinating role for the latter. The state constructs a framework in which it can address the political and economic issues with these organized and centralized groups. In this view, parliament and party politics lose influence in the policy forming process.  In foreign policy  From the political aspect, 'pluralism' has a huge effect on the process and decision-making in formulating policy. In international security, during the policy making process, different parties may have a chance to take part in decision making. The one who has more power, the more opportunity that it gains and the higher possibility to get what it wants. According to M. Frances (1991), \\"decision making appears to be a maze of influence and power.\\" See also *Agonism *Decision-making *Distributism *Foreign Policy * Elite theory *International relations *Legitimation Crisis * Marxism *New institutionalism * Salad Bowl (cultural idea) Notes References * Ankerl Guy(2000) Coexisting Contemporary Civilizations.

The term woodlot is chiefly North American; in Britain, a woodlot would be called a wood, woodland, or coppice. Many woodlots occur as part of a farm or as buffers and undevelopable land between these and other property types such as housing subdivisions, industrial forests, or public properties (highways, parks, watersheds, etc.). Very small woodlots can occur where a subdivision has not met its development potential, or where terrain does not easily permit other uses. Very large woodlots (hundreds of acres) might emerge where profitable wood species have been depleted by commercial logging practices or compromised by diseases, leaving little choice but to divide and liquidate the real estate for other purposes. One distinguishing characteristic of a woodlot is that the parcel size or quality of wood on the parcel does not generally justify full-scale commercial harvesting, leaving many woodlots as private investments by individuals. On the other hand, good forest management practices, even on a small scale, may create a sustainable source of products, which can significantly contribute to the aggregate inventory available to forest- product consumers. Woodlot economics In the era when family farming employed a large percentage of the population in the United States and Canada, it was typical of prized parcels of farmland that they included a woodlot from which the family could harvest firewood, wood for buildings and wagons, and wood for repair work. On the Great Plains woodlots were scarce, but not so elsewhere. In New England and Ontario especially, making sugar from sugar maple sap was an important part of farm life. Today, a woodlot of a generally noncommercial nature may make it difficult to justify the expense of ownership, capital equipment, management, and harvesting, unless some revenue can be added to the intangible benefits. Some jurisdictions encourage woodlots (over subdivisions) by providing property tax reductions (see, e.g., Current use) or by subsidized consulting and management plans. For example, a state or provincial government may recognize the important contributions that small, non-industrial land owners make to conservation of natural resources, and provide administrative tools, information and even funding. There may also be income tax advantages for those who are able to operate their woodlot as a small business, or even as a passive investment (e.g., capital equipment depreciation, inventory depletion and operating expense deductions). Depending on soils, aspect, parcel size and plant species and age, a properly managed woodlot might provide sufficient firewood annually for heating a number of local homes, as well as sawlogs and poles for periodic construction or repair of out-buildings. In fact, some states (including New Hampshire) grant woodlot owners an exemption from harvest \\"yield taxes\\" otherwise payable on limited quantities taken for personal use. A suitably capable and equipped woodlot owner may enjoy doing the work himself (simple forestry, road-building, selective logging, firewood processing, etc.). Others might prefer sharing the costs with similarly situated neighbors to have several adjacent parcels managed simultaneously by local loggers. Otherwise, hiring professionals to reap small quantities of firewood may be too expensive to be cost-effective. With the relatively high cost of fossil fuels for heating, a personal woodlot may be held as a biomass energy \\"savings account\\". When fuel prices go up, the woodlot pays for itself by providing firewood. When fuel prices go down, the woodlot can be left to mature, or managed for improved output of other products with an eventual higher profit. However, because of the slow nature of tree growth (for most valuable firewood trees), the profitability of many woodlots must be viewed as a long-term investment, with 20 to 50 years of management necessary before harvesting at a profit. Furthermore, in areas undergoing development, market pressures may ultimately result in poorly managed woodlots being sold and subdivided, often merely because property taxes become unbearable.

He was born in the United Kingdom but lived his early years in Ghana in Kumasi and Accra. He has been living in Ghana continuously since he pioneered the Hip-Life movement in 1994. He pioneered the Hiplife art form and has played an important role in the development of this uniquely African genre in Ghana's capital Accra. He raps in Akan Twi and English.\\"Accra reclaims hip-hop\\", BBC News, 4 November 2003. In 2004, Rockstone won the Kora Award for the best African video and he performed in front of a 50,000-person crowd in Ghana, together with Shaggy.\\"Ghanaian artists you'll be hearing across Ras' shows\\", BBC Radio 1. In 2006 he recorded a track with the Jamaican Dancehall singer Beenie Man called \\"Chukku Chakka\\" (in reference to Rockstone's 1999 hit \\"Eye Mo De Anaa\\", which sampled Fela Kuti). Rockstone is the son of fashion designer Ricky \\"Ricci\\" Ossei (Saint Ossei). Reggie Rockstone attended Achimota School. Reggie joined Ghanaian hip hop group VVIP following the exit of Promzy in 2014. Early life and music career Born in the U.K. on April 11, 1964, Reginald Osei aka Reggie Rockstone attached himself to the Hip Hop movement in the early 80's as a dancer. Travelling on a tri-continental basis (i.e. Accra, New York, London), he broadened his Hip Hop scope. A natural performer and trained actor, he grabbed the mic with no problem when his calling came in 1991. His first 'fifteen minutes of fame' came as a dancer in Accra, Ghana in the early 80's. His second chance of fame came in 1992-93 as member of one of the top rap groups from London, England. He belonged to PLZ (Parables, Linguistics and Zlang) with Fredi Funkstone, Jay (both from West Africa) & DJ Pogo of the U.K. Number one hits from PLZ included \\"If it Aint PLZ\\" and an EP entitled \\"Build a Wall Around Your Dreams\\" released on an independent label called \\"Go For the Juggler.\\" 1994 became the watershed or turning point in his entertainment career. The rap scene in London was not rewarding enough. He returned to Accra to encounter a whole generation of people grooving to African-American rhythms, all heavily influenced by the same elements of Hip Hop that he knew all too well. Recognition and music style He had an idea! Use the hip hop beats with authentic phat production and lace it with true African dialect; The Akan language of Twi. It became the tool to make such butter classics as \\"Sweetie, Sweetie\\", \\"Tsoo Boi\\", \\"Nightlife in Accra\\" and \\"Agoo\\" from his debut album in 1997 entitled \\"Makaa! Maka!\\". Launched on an independent label called KASSA RECORDS that he partly owns, Reggie Rockstone has reached Ghanaians and non- Ghanaians across four continents Reggie Rockstone is credited as the pioneer of hiplife or Kasahara music in Ghana and like some masters of the art of hip hop, he has proclaimed his retirement and out of retirement several times. His specialty in Asante Twi and is incredibly well versed in English too. He is internationally acclaimed, with several performances throughout West Africa, the UK, France, USA and Switzerland. Appointments to be on judges panels In 2013 he was selected to be a judge of the maiden edition of the Glo X Factor Africa along with Onyeka Onwenu and M.I.

Branches of the museum were located in Riverhead, New York and Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. The location in Branson, Missouri closed and relocated, and is now known as Branson Dinosaur Museum. History The original Dinosaur Walk Museum first opened its doors to the public on June 24, 2004 and was located in Riverhead, New York, on Long Island. Designed and created by the artist Fred Hoppe, the museum featured one of the world's largest collections of prehistoric animals. This museum was shut down in July 2008. The Pigeon Forge location was reportedly closed in 2011. Exhibits All of the exhibits, which represent 47 species, have been recreated life-size and are based upon actual fossil records. Some of the exhibits include: Tyrannosaurus rex, Platecarpus, Parasaurolophus, Daspletosaurus, Deinonychus, Coelophysis, Velociraptor, Troodon, Plesiosaurs, Oviraptor, large and small flying reptiles and the skulls, bones, and skeletons of prehistoric mammals, fossils and other items of interest. Hand painted murals surround the , two-level museum. The museum also features two high-definition movie theaters with continuous educational dinosaur movies, hands-on activities for children, and a gift shop. Some of the dinosaurs found at the Dinosaur Walk Museum are: T-Rex: The Tyrannosaurus rex was known to have lived during the late Cretaceous Period, 66 million years ago. It grew to be over in length, over tall and weighed up to 7.5 tons. Platecarpus: The Platecarpus is an extinct aquatic lizard, part of the Mosasaur family. It grew to be up to long and ate mainly fish, squid and ammonites. Parasaurolophus: The Parasaurolophus, like the T-Rex, lived during the Cretaceous Period 76-66 million years ago. It grew to be long, high, and weighed almost 7,700 pounds. The Parasauolophus was an herbivore. The large crest was thought to be used for communication amongst males and females. Daspletosaurus: The Daspletosaurus was known to have lived during the Upper Cretaceous Period and found in what is now North America. Thought to be a possible ancestor of the T-Rex. It grew to over in length and weighed almost four tons, and was primarily a carnivore. Deinonychus: The Deinonychus grew to be almost long and weighed up to 175 pounds, living during the early cretaceous period. Deinonychus, like many raptors, had a sickle claw used primarily for attacking its prey. Coelophysis: Living during the late Triassic Period almost 210 million years ago. It grew to be between 2–3 meters in length and less than a meter tall at the hips. Coelophysis had an unusual formation in the vertebrae, forming an \\"S\\" like shape in its neck. It is the \\"official dinosaur\\" of New York State. Velociraptor: Living during the late Cretaceous Period, 83-70 million years ago. The Velociraptor, a carnivore, grew to be up to in length and could grow up to 45 pounds. The Velociraptors had on their feet long curved claws used for attacking their prey. They had a bone structure similar to many modern day birds. Troodon: The Troodon, a very small bird-like dinosaur, grew to be up to in length, tall and only weighed up to 130 pounds. Living during the late Cretaceous Period, 75–66 million years ago. Originally thought to be carnivorous, modern evidence shows that it is possible that they were omnivorous or possibly an herbivore. Plesiosaurs: The Plesiosaurs were carnivorous aquatic reptiles. First appearing at the beginning of the Jurassic Period they thrived throughout the Cretaceous Period. They lived during the same time as the dinosaurs but were not dinosaurs, they are considered reptiles. Oviraptor: The Oviraptor, or \\"Egg Thief\\", lived during the late Cretaceous Period between 80-70 million years ago. Early evidence shows that the Oviraptor was attempting to steal Protoceratops eggs. When the dig was discovered the Ovirapotor was huddled over a nest of what turned out to be Oviraptor eggs. Although the name means egg thief they are now considered to be egg protectors.

Biography Kapferer studied at the University of Sydney and later for the PhD at the University of Manchester. His early fieldwork was in Zambia where he researched among the Bisa of Lake Bangweulu and among mine and commercial workers in the town of Kabwe. Working under Clyde Mitchell he was an early pioneer of social network analysis but later, following extensive fieldwork in Sri Lanka, he shifted his focus to ritual demonstrating the importance of the phenomenology of aesthetics to the analysis of ritual performance. He has since extended this interest to the interpretation of nationalism and its violence. Kapferer established two anthropology departments in Australia (at the University of Adelaide and at James Cook University). He was the main inspiration behind the foundation of the Cairns Institute. Kapferer has also held professorial posts in anthropology at University College London (where he is now an Honorary Professorial Fellow) and at the University of Bergen, where he is currently Emeritus. In 1976 Kapferer, in collaboration with Kingsley Garbett and Michael Roberts, founded the journal Social Analysis.

Early life Stammers grew up in Saffron Walden, Essex. He got into punk music by going to see live bands at Cambridge Corn Exchange and other nearby venues. Stammers' first band was 'The Jump', based in Newport, a village close to Saffron Walden and from an early age his main influence for playing bass was Slade's bass player Jimmy Lea, who he cites as an influence today, along with Paul Simonon (The Clash), Bruce Foxton (The Jam) and Horace Panter (The Specials). Musical career The first major band that Stammers joined was The Straps in 1979, followed by British post-punk band Theatre of Hate in 1980, formed by both Kirk Brandon and Stammers, and managed by Terry Razor. Before joining Theatre of Hate Stan played for punk band the Epileptics and later The Straps. Stammers turned down an offer to join punk band UK Subs to be in Theatre of Hate with Kirk Brandon. During their two-year existence Theatre of Hate released a number of singles and albums, most notably \\"Legion\\", the B-side to the first single \\"Original Sin\\", the Westworld album which was produced by Mick Jones of The Clash, and the \\"Westworld\\" single which went to No. 40 in the UK charts, qualifying the band for an appearance on Top of the Pops. In January 1983 after the demise of Theatre of Hate, Brandon and Stammers started Spear of Destiny. The band would have numerous line-up changes until Stammers left in 1986. From the onset, the band became well known for their live shows, and quickly captured a faithful following. In the early period that Stammers was with the band, they released a number of notable singles and albums. In March 1986, Stammers decided to leave the band to work on his own material and to start a new band. In mid-1986, Stammers formed Crazy Pink Revolvers. In January 1987, CPR recorded their first studio album First Down, released by Chainsaw Records. In early 1987, CPR signed to ABC Records and recorded the Timeless Smile EP. Early in 1988, the band recorded their second album At the Rivers Edge. In January 1989, CPR recorded their second single, \\"Wednesday 19:45\\". The single which was taken from the album was written about the Kings Cross fire on the London Underground in 1988. In March 1989, Stammers decided to leave the band and in September 1989 left London with his American girlfriend to live in Philadelphia, US. Stammers teamed up again with Kirk Brandon in 1990 for 4 years doing a number of tours and a couple of albums under the Spear of Destiny, Theatre of Hate, Elephant Daze and 10:51 banners. During this time, Stammers would also play with his own band Boy Boy Nova, as well as running a recording studio. In 1990, Spear of Destiny reformed for three nights at London's famous Marquee Club, and the following year went on a UK wide tour as Theatre of Hate. In 1992, Spear of Destiny recorded the album SOD's Law and did another UK tour. In early 1993, Kirk Brandon moved to Philadelphia where they toured off and on for over a year as Theatre of Hate, and for a few gigs as Elephant Daze. In mid-1994, the band recorded as Kirk Brandon's 10:51. An album, Stone in the Rain was released in the UK in 1995 and as Theatre of Hate, it was released under the title Retribution in the U.S. in 1996. The single \\"Children of the Damned\\" was also released. In December 1994, Stammers decided to leave the band. Plastic Eaters were formed in Philadelphia in early 1996. Stammers had approach James Atkin, the lead singer from EMF. The band played gigs around the US. In December 2008, Plastic Eaters released a version of the Slade hit \\"Merry X-Mas Everybody\\" as a digital download release. As well as working with his band Theatre of Hate, rejoining in 2012 as a full-time member, Stammers also runs his own music production company, Plastic Eater Sound with his business partner Rob Daly. He also works as a session musician for various artists, which includes both live and studio work. As of December 2017, Stammers had reformed Crazy Pink Revolvers as a side project alongside his work with Theatre of Hate, and as of May 2018, were to tour the United Kingdom.

It was published daily until 1922, when it was shut down by the fascist regime. In some places its circulation exceeded that of the socialist paper Avanti!. Upon the fall of the regime in 1945, publication began again, this time as a weekly. The paper continues today and Umanità Nova is the mouthpiece of the Italian Anarchist Federation. Contributors to Umanità Nova include its founders, Errico Malatesta and Antonio Cieri; Camillo Berneri, Armando Borghi, Carlo Frigerio and Emilia Rensi. reconstruction of Umanità Nova 's first issue History =Early years= The paper was begun in 1909, by Ettore Molinari and Nella Giacomelli, who thought to turn the pamphlet \\"Human Protest\\" (La Protesta Umana) into a daily journal. During a national convention in 1911, the Rome Anarchist Communist Group proposed a national outlet to reach the movement outside the country, and in turn reinforce it within Italy.Schirone, p. 17 In April 1919, a large gathering of Italian anarchists, both organizationalists and individualists, attended a national convention in Florence, and agreed upon the need to close ranks and form a union together: the Italian Anarchist Communist Union. One of the main resolutions was to print a paper,Schirone, p. 19 and when Molinari and Giacomelli proposed it be published as a national daily, they and Emilio Spinaci were given the responsibility of determining whether it was possible to accomplish the feat of getting all the anarchists together, and began gathering the funds. Nella Giacomelli gave the paper its present name, saying, Due to a blockade of the funds, delays in the post and a decree placing a quota on paper, to the downfall of new journals, publication was only possible thanks to an intervention by the workers of the lignite caves of Valdarno who supplied the energy for paper-mills, sending word that they would refuse to make any more deliveries until there was a guarantee to supply paper to Umanità Nova. October 9, 1919 a notice was printed that the daily paper would be prepared, and funds began to arrive: about 200,000 lira were dedicated to bring it to life. So, on February 26, 1920 the first issue of Umanità Nova was released, an evening edition of four pages, ten cents cover price. 9,000 copies of the first edition grew to 40,000 within a month, and 50,000 in a heated moment, and if more weren't printed it was only because of the lack of paper.Umanità Nova, v. I, n. 1 p. 1, February 26–27, 1920 Its cash pool exceeded a million lira. The enormous success reflected not only on the anarchist movement, but on a vast segment of the left which was now contiguous with the movement and would remain so for several months, until the failure of the factory occupations, which happened to turn it away. The bold, political line the anarchists held in their struggle helped them grow in terms of numbers and importance. If the Congress of Florence in 1919 had 145 in attendance in July 1920, the meeting in Bologna attracted about 700. In the syndicalist camp, the Italian Syndicalist Union (USI) went from 58,000 members by the end of 1919 to more than 180,000 in the first half of 1919 and to 300,000 the following year. Among the Confederation, the anarchists succeeded in taking the key administrative reformists such as the FIOM of Turin, with Pietro Ferrero and Maurizio Garino. It was a magical moment for Italian anarchism, to which the daily contributed more than a bit. This great efficacy was shown furthermore in the course of the imposing \\"factory occupation\\" movement among the workers. Just scroll through the pages of the newspaper in September 1920, to get an idea of how active anarchists were in the occupied factories and workshops, managed by their workers. Repression was not long in coming, and in October, almost the entire editorship of \\"Umanità Nova\\" was arrested, in the hundreds of arrests and searches carried out all across Italy, against anarchists and revolutionary syndicalists. Immediately following that, the USI was beheaded by the arrest of the entire General Council. The police, however, could not figure out how the newspaper was still issued every day, with its editors in jail. The dragnet had not captured Gigi Damiani, who contacted individuals who had gone underground and avoided the wave of repression, and who had created a network which allowed it to move continuously. The newspaper was compiled this way, eventually reaching Milan where it was published regularly. = Censorship, harassment, and closure = On February 29, 1920 there was a rally in Milan, in the Porta Romana school gym, organized by the Proletarian League of injured and disabled veterans. Leftists and trade unionists took part, including the anarchist Errico Malatesta, and Pasquale Binazzi and Armando Borghi's Italian Syndicalist Union (USI). The peaceful demonstration turned out to be a tragic anticipation of the fascist attack squads in the two years which followed. Protesters were repeatedly charged by the police, who fired on a train carrying demonstrators and killed two, wounding five others. With fascists supporting the ordinary police forces, the number of leaders in the anarchist movement shrank from 28 in 1921 to 3 in 1926. The history of Umanità Nova -- its daily publication in Milan interrupted by the Diana event, moving to Rome where it became weekly and irregular until its final closure in 1922 -- is thoroughly documented in a special dossier of the Directorate-General of Public Security. It began as an ambitious publishing accomplishment led by Malatesta, having a hugely successful subscription drive leading up to its first issue (135,000 lira of \\"funds collected in the Kingdom\\" by January 1920), and copies reserved in advance (6 lira for 100 copies), then the promotion, lotteries and house parties, and the establishment of \\"Committees for Umanità Nova\\" everywhere. The final act came when the police headquarters in Rome filed a complaint against twenty former editors, correspondents, and members of the board of directors of Umanità Nova. A large pile of correspondence, pamphlets and propaganda were seized, and the newspaper's assets taken: 5,700 lira, 300 marks, 20,000 crowns and a checking account at Credito Italiano with 71,328 lira available, plus all their records. A similar situation took place in La Spezia, where the Blackshirts had destroyed the printing press and burned the offices of Il Libertario, and with L'Avvenire Anarchico in Pisa. On October 28, 1922, the king Vittorio Emanuele III entrusted Benito Mussolini with the \\"task of forming a new government\\". Umanità Nova has this to say about his decision to give power to the executive head of the blackshirts:Schirone, p. 96 Umanità Nova also places responsibility on the socialists for helping the fascists' political ascent:Schirone, p. 96 Immediately following the fascist occupation of Rome, on October 30, 1922, the offices on Via Santa Croce in Milan were invaded and destroyed. After three weeks of forced silence, on November 22 they found a printer willing to publish the paper, and while the devastating fury of the blackshirts raged, issue number 196 of Umanità Nova was released. It would be the last.Schirone, p. 96 = New beginnings, abroad = The Italian experiment ended by force, Umanità Nova was reborn in Brooklyn, USA between 1924-25Bettini, p. 216 Eighteen issues were published under the new editor Maris Baldini, a publicist. There are passionate articles about the fight against fascism, and the campaign to free Sacco and Vanzetti. Many interventions and analyses appeared on the Italian situation and on the role of anarchists in this phase: some important and interesting writings by Camillo da Lodi (a pseudonym of Camillo Berneri), A. Borghi, Luigi Fabbri, and others. The American edition of the journal immediately found a large following among exile communities, and the first issues sold out completely. Two special issues of Umanità Nova were published in Buenos Aires in 1930 and 1932.Bettini, p. 25 From October 20, 1932 to April 15, 1933, ten issues were published from Puteaux:Bettini, p. 134 Camillo Berneri and Antonio Cieri, and a number of free exiles, are the architects of the journal's rebirth as a biweekly, and its trajectory is a history of repression by French authorities. The international scope of Umanità Nova reaches Russia and Spain in particular, in its new social environment the paper entered a new phase, its authors desired that it become a paper with international horizons, opening a window onto workers' struggles in each country. The first months of 1933 are full of events of international importance. In January there was an anarchist uprising in Spain, which ended in the arrest, torture, and assassination of rebels in the Iberian Anarchist Federation, and in Germany, Hitler came to power, resulting in censorship of the press, restriction of the freedom of association, and repression of the Nazi's opponents. At this moment of critical social importance to the exiles, France ordered Umanità Nova to be shut down again. Only three issues of La Protesta exist, the last is dated March 28, 1933. The newspaper appeared again, illegally, in Italy in 1943, fulfilling the dream of Camillo Berneri. = World War II and Resistance = After ten years of forced silence, Umanità Nova was published by the underground once again, under the title \\"Risorgiamo\\" (Resurrection), on September 10, 1943.Schirone, p. 247 Between September 1943 and October 1944, articles were written not simple with only the intention of forming solidarity with oppressed subjects, but with the political purpose of urging a fight against fascism. The warning to \\"concede nothing\\" in the partisan fight came from this open letter to women, almost a political manifesto: Reestablishment of political parties, demonstrations, and freedom of the press continued to be banned and repressed. The mood engendered by these circumstances and the growing demands of workers returning from the war, in the great strikes that had closed factories in Naples from August 17–20, 1943, just before the city successfully resisted the Nazi occupation, can be read in anti-fascist papers, from the communist l'Unità to the socialist Avanti!, from the actionist L'Italia libera to the anarchist Umanità Nova.Schirone, p. 249 Additional concrete suggestions and analysis appears in the article \\"Fascists and Nazis at work\\", interesting because it turns the favorite formula of treason used by Nazi propaganda on its head: After the collapse of Fascism in July 1943, and the Armistice that September, the Italian Anarchist Federation (FAI) took over management and publication of the paper, and it took on many of the characteristics of that group's libertarian philosophy: internal organization is not absolute and rigid, but is shaped by the mandates of a congress, who also establish the editorial motifs; an extensive network of frequent collaborators is recognized, any of its readers can have an exchange with the paper, with the effect that a substantial number of articles are published by very occasional collaborators; there is absolute freedom to choose the topic to be covered; distribution is left largely to the talents of militants. The circulation data is interesting, although quite difficult to reconstruct. The paper's spread was closely related to the native anarchist movement in each area, and to the different phases of the evolving Italian political and social situation. With some guesswork, we see that circulation rose from 13,000 in 1944, to an average of 15–16,000 copies per issue, up to a peak of 18,000, reached in 1946, then gradually decreasing to 10,000-10,500 copies in the early 1950s. Approximately 60% of revenue was from direct sales, while subscriptions accounted for at most 15%. The range of its greatest distribution were historically more consolidated: Tuscany, Lazio, and Emilia- Romagna. = Present = The editorship and management are currently appointed by a congress of the FAI, and its members rotate every three years unless there are exceptional circumstances. The rotation of offices, used for every post in the FAI, helps prevent any concentration of power. Umanità Nova is printed weekly at a shop in self-managed Carrara, and distributed throughout Italy, among anarchist groups and headquarters, libraries, community centers, newsstands and bookstores, and also abroad. A complete list of outlets can be found on the magazine's website. It is also distributed in pdf format. The newspaper is a weekly issue and publishes around 35 issues per year. Its articles covers the themes of workers struggles, antimilitarism, feminism, social-ecologism, antispecism and internationalism. Umanità Nova also publishes translations from foreign anarchist websites and newspaper, most notably from Le Monde Libertaire (France), LibCom.org, CrimethInc.com, Tierra y Libertad (Spain) and Meydan (Turkey). On the occasion of international anarchist and anarcho-sindacalists meetings and congress the newspaper covers the events with long-form articles and interviews of members of others organizations. It hosts thematic debates which are developed in a number of issues, about political and more theoretical question. The editorial board is known, in Italian anarchist milieu, for its hardcore scientific, classist, internationalist and anti-primitivist views, which lead to a number of polemics with \\"anarcho\\"-primitivist and \\"post anarchist\\" groups and individuals.

As pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of New Orleans, his Thanksgiving sermon in 1860 had a great influence in leading Louisiana to join the Confederate States of America. After 1865 he was minister in the Presbyterian Church in the United States. Palmer was born in Charleston, South Carolina, to Edward Palmer and the former Sarah Bunce. He was educated at Amherst College from 1833 to 1834. He taught school for two years and then attended the University of Georgia from which he graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1838. At Georgia he was a member of the Phi Kappa Literary Society. From 1839 to 1841 he attended the Presbyterian-affiliated Columbia Theological Seminary, at that time located in South Carolina. In 1841 he married the former Mary Augusta McConnell of Columbia. In 1852 he received the doctor of divinity degree from Oglethorpe University near Milledgeville, Georgia. In 1870 he received the LL.D. degree from Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri. He pastored the First Presbyterian Church of Savannah, Georgia, from 1841 to 1842. He was called to First Presbyterian in Columbia, the South Carolina capital, a post he held from 1843 to 1855. He also taught in the Columbia Seminary (his alma mater) from 1853 to 1856 while he was pastoring. In 1856, he accepted the pastorate of First Presbyterian Church of New Orleans, his terminal position which he held for forty-six years. He and his family lived at 1415 Prytania Street, in the lower Garden District neighborhood of New Orleans, and the mansion has been authentically restored and turned into part of the Creole Gardens Hotel. In his personal copy of Rev. Moses Stuart's Hebrews Commentary, seminary student Wallace H. Stratton identifies \\"B. M. Palmer DD. Didactic\\" as a faculty member of the Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Columbia, S. C., in the year 1863. In his Thanksgiving sermon just days after the election of Abraham Lincoln as U.S. president, Palmer defended slavery and endorsed secession, saying that it was the South's \\"providential trust\\" to preserve the institution of slavery.Benjamin Palmer's \\"Thanksgiving Sermon\\" This was only days before South Carolina became the first of the eleven states to secede from the Union. When federal troops invaded New Orleans and imposed military rule under General Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts, Palmer sent his wife and children to her father's plantation in South Carolina. He spent the remainder of the war preaching primarily to Confederate soldiers. An older Benjamin M. Palmer. Palmer's opposition on moral grounds to the Louisiana Lottery, operated by former Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard, helped to doom that institution as a means of raising state revenues. He preached the opening sermon and was elected the first moderator of his denomination on December 4, 1861. When the Synod of Louisiana was formed in 1901, a year before his death, he was elected its first moderator. Palmer's writings include a biography of Presbyterian minister and Columbia Seminary theologian James Henley Thornwell (1812-1862). Palmer also wrote volumes of sermons and theological treatises, including Theology of Prayer, The Broken Home, or Lessons in Sorrow, and Formation of Character. Palmer's wife died in his arms on November 13, 1888, apparently from gastritis. Palmer said that he never recovered from her death. Palmer was struck by a streetcar in New Orleans on May 5, 1902, and died twenty days later. The Palmers' remains are entombed in the city's Metairie Cemetery. One of the Palmer daughters married John Caldwell, the curator of Tulane University in New Orleans. Palmer himself established the Southwest Presbyterian Seminary (now Rhodes College). Palmer Hall at Rhodes College was named after him but renamed to Southwestern Hall on April 12, 2019 by the Rhodes College Board of Trustees after recommendations by the Palmer Hall Discernment committee review found that Palmer \\"...the principal legacy of Benjamin Palmer, which was found to be fundamentally at odds with our college Vision.\\".https://rhodes.edu/about-rhodes/southwestern-hall/palmer-hall- discernment-committee/palmer-hall-discernment-committee Palmer's papers are in several locations, including Louisiana State University and Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur, Georgia. An orphanage named for Palmer was started in 1895 in Columbus, Mississippi; Palmer Home for Children is \\"a Christ-centered home, Where Hope Still Grows.\\" Palmer Avenue and Palmer Park in uptown New Orleans were both named for him.Friends of the Cabildo, Samuel Wilson, New Orleans Architecture: The University Section Pelican Publishing, (2000) p.24 In its obituary of Palmer, the Christian publication The Interior reflected as follows: :Dr. Palmer served God and his generation as a symbol of the immutability of the great essentials of our religion. His faithful witness to Jesus Christ in the word of his preaching and the example of his ministry gave him such power in New Orleans as few of the Lord's ambassadors have ever wielded in any age of the church. By all consent he was acknowledged for years to be the most influential man in that city, and he was so brave and outspoken that he made for righteousness not only in the private lives of men but in the civic life of the community. Thanksgiving Sermon Benjamin Palmer included the following in his sermon: > The cords which, during four-fifths of a century, have bound together this > growing Republic, are now strained to their utmost tension—they just need > the touch of fire to part asunder forever. ...I deplored the divisions > amongst us, as being, to a large extent, impertinent in the solemn crisis > which was too evidently impending. ...At a juncture so solemn as the > present, with the destiny of a great people waiting upon the decision of an > hour, it is not lawful to be still. ...The question, too, which now places > us upon the brink of revolution, was, in its origin a question of morals and > religion. ...In determining our duty in this emergency it is necessary that > we should first ascertain the nature of the trust providentially committed > to us. ...A nation often has a character as well defined and intense as that > of the individual. ...If, then, the South is such a people, what at this > juncture is their providential trust? I answer, that it is to conserve and > to perpetuate the institution of domestic slavery as now existing.Benjamin > Morgan Palmer, Thanksgiving sermon, delivered at the First Presbyterian > church, New Orleans, on Thursday, December 29, 1860, G.

Life Gist was born in Baltimore, Maryland (one source says Reisterstown, Maryland), the fourth child of Thomas and Susannah Cockey Gist. Thomas Gist's father, Captain Richard Gist (1684 – August 28, 1741), was the surveyor of Maryland's Eastern Shore and one of the commissioners who laid out Baltimore Town in 1729. Richard Gist's father, Christopher Richard Gist (1655 or 1659 – Feb. 1690), was an English emigrant who came to the Province of Maryland before 1682 and settled in \\"South Canton\\" on the south bank of the Patapsco River. Christopher Richard Gist married Edith Cromwell (1660–1694), who is believed to have been a relative of Oliver Cromwell. Gist was the nephew of Christopher Gist (1706–1759), a son of Richard Gist. Christopher Gist was a Colonial-era explorer, scout, and frontier settler who was employed by the Ohio Company and had served with 21-year-old Colonel George Washington. (Christopher Gist is credited with twice saving Washington's life when they were surveying land in the Ohio country in 1753.) Mordecai Gist was also distantly related to John Eager Howard. Mordecai Gist was educated for commercial pursuits. At the beginning of the American Revolution, the young men of Baltimore associated under the title of the \\"Baltimore Independent Company\\" and elected Gist as their captain. It was the first company raised in Maryland for the defense of popular liberty. Revolutionary war service In 1776, Gist was appointed major of a battalion of regulars, and was with them in the Battle of Long Island where they fought a delaying action at the Old Stone House (Brooklyn, New York), allowing the American army to escape encirclement. In January 1779, the Continental Congress appointed him as a brigadier general in the Continental Army, and he took the command of the 2nd Maryland Brigade. He fought stubbornly at the Battle of Camden in South Carolina in 1780. At one time after a bayonet charge, his force secured fifty prisoners, but the British under Lord Cornwallis rallied, and the Marylanders gave way. Gist escaped, and, a year later, he was present at the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown. (Gist appears (back row, right side) in John Trumbull's painting Surrender of Lord Cornwallis which hangs in the rotunda of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C.) He joined the southern army under Nathanael Greene, and he was given the command of the light corps again when the army was remodelled in 1782. On August 26, 1782, he rallied the broken forces of the Americans under John Laurens after they had been defeated by a small British foraging party. After the war After the war, Gist relocated to plantation near Charleston, South Carolina. He was admitted as an original member of the Society of the Cincinnati in both Maryland and South Carolina. He also served as the grand master of Freemasons in South Carolina. He had two children, both sons, one of whom he named \\"Independent\\" and the other \\"States.\\" He died on September 12, 1792, at the age of 50, in Charleston and is buried in St. Michael's ChurchyardRevolutionary War Journal next to his son, States Gist, and daughter Susannah Gist. Mordecai Gist was distantly related to States Rights Gist, a brigadier general in the Confederate army during the American Civil War who died of wounds received while leading his brigade in a charge against U.S. fortifications at the Battle of Franklin in November 1864. States Rights Gist was the great-grandson of William Gist (born 1711), uncle of Mordecai Gist. His papers are held at the Maryland Historical Society.

Koziegłowy then became part of the Duchy of Siewierz, which in 1790 was merged with Lesser Poland. On April 27, 1792, Koziegłowy received its town charter from King Stanisław August Poniatowski. In 1795 the town was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia (see Partitions of Poland), becoming part of the province of New Silesia. In 1807 it was annexed by the Duchy of Warsaw, which in 1815 became Russian-controlled Congress Poland. Following other Lesser Poland's towns, the Russians stripped Koziegłowy of its charter (1870), reducing it to the status of a village. In 1918 Koziegłowy returned to re-established Poland, and until September 1939 it belonged to Second Polish Republic's Kielce Voivodeship before captured German Wehrmacht.

Kersey was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He attended and graduated from Edison High School where he sang in the glee club and played football. He was a lifelong football fan and loved his Philadelphia Eagles. Kersey served in the United States Air Force from 1967 through 1972. While in the service he often played piano and keyboards at the local boards. There is where he gained the nickname \\"have mercy\\". It was the name the patrons would scream at him as he played because they loved his funky rhythms. Upon returning to Philadelphia, he re- acquainted himself with his longtime friend and musician Norman Harris. Norman was instrumental in Kersey becoming a studio musician at Sigma Sound Studios. He later became a member of the disco band The Trammps. Kersey did not like the constant travel so he decided to quit the band and concentrate on producing and writing. In 1978 he received a Grammy Award as producer for the soundtrack to Saturday Night Fever which included \\"Disco Inferno\\", which he co-wrote with Leroy Green. He was also a member of MFSB and the Salsoul Orchestra. He moved to Los Angeles in 1980 and continued his career as a sought after studio musician, producer and songwriter. Kersey suffered a stroke in 1997 and died in Philadelphia in 2005. Ron is survived by a daughter Kisha, four grandchildren, eight great grandchildren, two sisters and his mother Gevoda. In addition to co-writing \\"Disco Inferno\\", Kersey produced or co-wrote songs that reached the top 20 for other artists. He produced Stephanie Mills’ \\"I Have Learned to Respect the Power of Love\\" which charted at number #1 for two weeks on the R&B; charts. It was Mills’ first number one single and would prove to be her most successful single. Ron Kersey was also the producer for her next single \\"If I Were Your Woman\\", a cover of the Gladys Knight and the Pips hit that reached number #1 for three weeks on the R&B; charts for Stephanie Mills. In addition, he co-wrote \\"Every Drop of Your Love\\" for Stacy Lattisaw that peaked at #8 on the R&B; charts. He co-wrote the classic slow jam \\"Send for Me\\" with his friend Sam Dees for Atlantic Starr which peaked at #16. For Evelyn \\"Champaign\\" King, he co-wrote \\"Kisses Don’t Lie\\" with Alex Brown peaking at #17 on the R&B; charts.

Early life Soffici was born in Rignano sull'Arno, near Florence. In 1893 his family moved to the latter city, where he studied at the Accademia from 1897 and later at the Scuola Libera del Nudo of the academy. Career Ardengo Soffici, 1912-13, Deconstruction of the Planes of a Lamp, oil on panel, 45 x 35 cm, Estorick Collection, London In 1900 he moved from Florence to Paris, where he lived for seven years and worked for Symbolist journals. While in Paris, during his time at the Bateau-Lavoir, he became acquainted with Braque, Derain, Picasso, Juan Gris and Apollinaire. On returning to Italy in 1907, Soffici settled in Poggio a Caiano in the countryside near Florence (where he lived for the rest of his life) and wrote articles on modern artists for the first issue of the political and cultural magazine La Voce. In 1910 he organised an exhibition of Impressionist painting in Florence in association with La Voce, devoting an entire room to the sculptor Medardo Rosso. In August 1911 he wrote an article in La Voce on Picasso and Braque, which probably influenced the Futurists in the direction of Cubism.Martin, Marianne W. Futurist Art and Theory, Hacker Art Books, New York, 1978, p.104 At this time Soffici considered Cubism to be an extension of the partial revolution of the Impressionists. In 1912-1913 Soffici painted in a Cubist style. Futurism Caffè Giubbe Rosse After visiting the Futurists' Exhibition of Free Art in Milan, he wrote a hostile review in La Voce. The leading Futurists Marinetti, Boccioni and Carrà, were so incensed by this that they immediately boarded a train for Florence and assaulted Soffici and his La Voce colleagues at the Caffè Giubbe Rosse.Martin, p.81 Reviewing the Futurists' Paris exhibition of 1912 in his article Ancora del Futurismo (Futurism Again) he dismissed their rhetoric, publicity-seeking and their art, but granted that, despite its faults, Futurism was \\"a movement of renewal, and that is excellent\\". Gino Severini was despatched from Milan to Florence to make peace with Soffici on behalf of the Futurists – the Peace of Florence, as Boccioni called it. After these diplomatic overtures, Soffici, together with Giovanni Papini, Aldo Palazzeschi and Italo Tavolato withdrew from La Voce in 1913 to form a new periodical, Lacerba, which would concentrate entirely on art and culture. Soffici published \\"Theory of the movement of plastic Futurism\\" in Lacerba, accepting that Futurism had reconciled what had previously seemed irreconcilable, Impressionism and Cubism. By its fifth issue Lacerba wholly supported the Futurists. Soffici's paintings in 1913 – e.g. Linee di una strada and Sintesi di una pesaggio autumnale – showed the influence of the Futurists in method and title and he exhibited with them. In 1914, personal quarrels and artistic differences between the Milan Futurists and the Florence group around Soffici, Papini and Carlo Carrà, created a rift in Italian Futurism. The Florence group resented the dominance of Marinetti and Boccioni, whom they accused of trying to establish \\"an immobile church with an infallible creed\\", and each group dismissed the other as passéiste. Inter- war years After serving in the First World War, Soffici married Maria Sdrigotti, whom he met in a publishing house in Udine, while editing Kobilek. They moved to Poggio a Caiano and had three children, Valeria, Sergio and Laura. Soffici created a distance from Futurism and, discovering a new reverence for Tuscan tradition, became associated with the \\"return to order\\" which manifested itself in the naturalistic landscapes which thereafter dominated his work. Remaining in Poggio a Caiano, he painted nature and traditional Tuscan scenes. There, he continued to write and paint and was visited by many artists, some of whom he helped in finding their place in the art world. In 1926, he discovered the young artist Quinto Martini when the latter visited Soffici's workshop with his work. In Martini's first experiments Soffici recognised the kind of genuine and intimate traits he was seeking and became his mentor. In 1925, he signed the Manifesto degli intellettuali fascisti in support of the regime, and in 1938 he gave support to Italy's racial laws. Later life When Mussolini was overthrown in Italy, he pledged loyalty to the Italian Social Republic with Mussolini as its head. He was a co-founder of Italia e Civilità, a war magazine that supported patriotism, Germany and the principles of Fascism. At the end of the Second World War, Soffici was taken as a British POW and was imprisoned for several months in unhealthy conditions at an allied prison camp where he contracted pneumonia. During his stay at the prison camp, he met several other artists and writers who had also been accused of political support to fascism. Together, they wrote, painted and set up plays to pass the time in the squalid conditions they found themselves in. Some of the paintings were exchanged for food and art materials from the guards. Later, once released due to lack of evidence, he returned home and lived in Poggio a Caiano and spent his summers in Forte dei Marmi. Death The tomb in Poggio a Caiano cemetery Soffici continued to paint and write until his death in Forte dei Marmi on August 12, 1964. His last photo was taken a few days before his demise, holding his youngest granddaughter Marina.Laura Poggi Soffici Bibliography =Poems= References and sources ;References ;Sources * Estorick Collection of Modern Italian Art * Category:1879 births Category:1964 deaths Category:People from the Province of Florence Category:Italian male writers Category:Italian Futurist painters Category:Italian military personnel of World War I Category:Futurist writers Category:Italian Futurism Category:Italian fascists Category:People of Montmartre ","title":"Ardengo Soffici"},{"id":"9484892","text":"Remediation of contaminated sites with cement, also called solidification/stabilization with cement (S/S with cement) is a common method for the safe environmental remediation of contaminated land with cement. The cement solidifies the contaminated soil and prevents pollutants from moving, such as rain causing leaching of pollutants into the groundwater or being carried into streams by rain or snowmelt. Developed in the 1950s, the technology is widely used today to treat industrial hazardous waste and contaminated material at brownfield sites i.e. abandoned or underutilized properties that are not being redeveloped because of fears that they may be contaminated with hazardous waste. S/S provides an economically viable means of treating contaminated sites. This technology treats and contains contaminated soil on site thereby reducing the need for landfills. Process The Solidification/Stabilization method utilizes chemically reactive formulations that form stable solids that are non-hazardous or less-hazardous than the original materials. Solidification refers to the physical changes in the contaminated material when a certain binding agent is added. These changes include an increase in compressive strength, a decrease in permeability, and condensing of hazardous materials. Stabilization refers to the chemical changes between the stabilizing agent (binding agent) and the hazardous constituent. These changes should include a less soluble, less toxic constituent with hindered mobility. 4.20 solidification/stabilization. (n.d.). Common bonding agents include, but are not limited to, portland cement, lime, limestone, fly ash, slag, clay, and gypsum. Because of the vast types of hazardous materials, each agent should be tested on the site before a full- scale project is put under way. Most binding agents used are a blend of various single binding agents, depending on the hazardous material it will be used on. Portland cement has been used to treat more contaminated material than any other S/S binding agent because of its ability to bind free liquids, reduce permeability, encapsulate hazardous materials, and reduce the toxicity of certain contaminants. Lime can be used to adjust the pH of the substance of drive off water by using high heats of hydration. Limestone can also be used to adjust pH levels. Slag is often used for economical purposes because of its low cost. Different methods =In situ= In situ is a Latin phrase meaning “in the place”. When referred to chemistry or chemical reactions it means “in the reaction mixture”. In situ S/S, accounting for 20% of S/S projects from 1982–2005, is used to mix binding agents into the contaminated material while remaining on the site. Outside benefits of in situ mixing include conserving transportation costs, no landfill usage, and lesser risk to surrounding communities to be exposed to the hazardous materials while in transport. In-situ mixing treatments can also have the added benefit of improving soil conditions on the site.Solidification/stabilization. (n.d.). Portland Cement Association =Ex situ= Ex situ is a Latin phrase meaning “off site”. In ex situ mixing, the hazardous materials are excavated, then machine-mixed with a certain bonding agent. This new, less-hazardous material is then deposited in a designated area, or reused on the initial site.Physical solidification/stabilization. (2002, June). From 1982–2005, ex-situ S/S technologies have accounted for 80% of the 217 projects that were completed. Limitations and concerns Prolonged use of the treated site and environmental and weather conditions may cause the materials used to stabilize the contaminants to erode, limiting the effect of the stabilization on the hazardous materials. Because of this, continuous monitoring of the site is required in order to ensure the contaminants have not re-assembled. Environmental factors such as freezing–thawing and wetting–drying were the focus of many studies dealing with the strength of S/S. It was found that freezing and thawing had the most adverse effects on the durability of the treated materials. When dealing with a radioactive contaminant, the solidification process may be interfered by various other types of hazardous waste. Most S/S processes have little or limited effects on organics and pesticides. Only by destroying these wastes by heating at very high temperatures will organics and pesticides be immobilized. Prior to performing the process to these types of sites, treatability studies need to be conducted in order to conclude if the solidification/stabilization process will be beneficial. These cement processes can result in major volume changes to the site, often up to double its original volume. Projects =Sydney Tar Ponds= The governments of Canada and the province of Nova Scotia agreed in January 2007 to clean up the infamous Sydney Tar Ponds contaminated site using S/S technology. Cement was mixed into the contaminated waste to solidify and stabilize it. When the S/S process was complete, the solidified areas were covered with an engineered cap consisting of a clay, followed by layers of gravel and soil. Finally, the surface was planted with grass and other vegetation.Tar ponds solidification/stabilization. (n.d.). =Former wood treating facility in Port Newark, New Jersey= S/S technologies were used to treat a contaminated former wood treating facility in Port Newark, New Jersey. Approximately of soil was contaminated by wood with arsenic, chromium, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. 8% of Portland cement was used by wet weight of contaminated soil. Both in situ and ex situ processes were utilized to treat over 35,000 cubic meters of contaminated soil. The ex situ treated soil was mixed with Portland cement by a pugmill then placed on top of the in situ treated soil. This created an excellent base for pavement to be placed over the site. The proposed use for the treated site is a shipping container storage area. Wilk, C. M. (n.d.). Applying solidification/stabilization for sustainable redevelopment of contaminated property. =Former electric generating station in Boston, Massachusetts= Abandoned warehouses in Boston, Massachusetts are being renovated or torn down in order to build new structures. On this site is the former Central Power System, built in 1890. When built, this power station was considered to be the biggest electric generating plant in the world. This building has been abandoned since the 1950s and has not produced electricity in over 90 years. In the early 90s, renovations were started but were quickly shut down when free-floating oil was discovered in the sewers. Cleanup efforts were unsuccessful as they brought more oil onto the site. In 1999, cement-based S/S treatments were utilized to treat 2,100 cubic meters of contaminated materials. Lead and Petroleum contaminated soils were managed and treated successfully at this site. =Dockside Green in Victoria British Columbia= A complex of mixed residential, office, retail and commercial space is being built on of former industrial land in downtown Victoria that was contaminated by lead. 10 tonnes of soil was treated with cement, which was mixed into the soil on site simply by using an excavator bucket. The soil was thus rendered completely safe as was shown by tests on soil samples. https://web.archive.org/web/20120723215847/http://www.cement.ca/en/Solidification- Stabilization/Dockside-Green-Development-Victoria-B-C.html =Former battery breaking site in Brandon, Manitoba= A 10,000 square metre lot formerly occupied by the Brandon Scrap Metal and Iron Company was chosen by the City of Brandon for the site for its new fire and police headquarters. For many years, lead cell batteries were destroyed there and the lead was extracted, leaving the untreated cases on site. An environmental assessment showed that the site was contaminated due to the presence of heavy metals, lead and hydrocarbon pollution. Cement based S/S was employed to successfully remediate 600 tonnes of contaminated soil. \\"Locking in Contamination\\", Hazmat Management Magazine 12-01-20 05 =Skeet shooting range near St. Catharines, Ontario= A vacant 5-hectare property near the Welland Canal in St. Catharines had surface soil containing dangerous concentrations of lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to a depth up to 0.4 m due to the past operations of an adjacent skeet shooting range.

The core buildings and streets that comprise Easton are intended to look like a self-contained town, reminiscent of American towns and cities in the early-to-mid 20th century. Included in the design are fountains, streets laid out in a grid pattern surrounded by a continuous loop, and metered storefront parking. A variety of stores, restaurants, and service- oriented businesses occupy structures of varying sizes, most of which are contiguous, having shared walls. Many of these structures have a similar external appearance. Also included are traditional shopping mall features like large, multi-floor department stores, small kiosks located in the indoor common areas, a cinema complex, ATMs, and both covered and open parking structures. Easton attracts about 25 million visitors per year.http://www.eastontowncenter.com/guest- information/agenttype/view/propertyid/226.aspx Tenants and layout Easton Town Center is anchored by Macy's and Nordstrom and includes about 240 other retail shops. Nordstrom is found at the northernmost point. Despite Easton being a developed town center, its grid system is not perfectly centered, with certain areas being designed for specific uses. For example, the South District hosts outdoor concerts, holiday events, and an interactive water fountain on its town square, and also has a large outdoor train set, the Easton Express. The only indoor area is the Station Building which houses shops, foodservice vendors, as well as a 30-screen AMC movie theater. Parking garages are scattered throughout. 2015 also saw additional retailers and restaurants moving into Easton Gateway, an expanded section of Easton. The Easton area is a partnership between Limited Brands and The Georgetown Company. Easton Town Center is currently leased and managed by Steiner & Associates. History The area that Easton Town Center now exists on was originally intended to be an expansion of Limited Brands. However, shifting demographics in central Ohio in the 1980s and 1990s made the potential greater. Instead of following in the typical path of large indoor malls, the retail development (co-developed by The Georgetown Company and Steiner + Associates) was instead turned to an outdoor lifestyle center. Easton Town Center became one of the first in the country; a trend that became much more prevalent in the 2000s. Easton Town Center was one of the first outdoor shopping centers to incorporate indoor parking, town squares, various fountains, and varying types of tenants. A real estate project of Les Wexner, the founder, chairman and CEO of nearby Limited Brands, Easton comprises of retail space built upon approximately within a larger development. The retail development was designed by M+A Architects serving as the Architect of Record. Phase I (the South District) opened in the summer of 1999. It was the site of the first ever Hollister Co. store, which opened in 2000. Phase II (the \\"Fashion District\\") opened in the fall of 2001. The North District is also home to a large circular fountain. Crate & Barrel constructed a location at Easton in 2004 and the South Garage was built to expand the number of parking spaces. In late 2015, the newest expansion was completed: the Easton Gateway development. The district, with a focus on service tenants, expanded the mixed use area by . The first tenant to open was Costco which did so in October. In early 2018, renovations on the station building had begun, including new floors walls, and updated services; the renovation ended in June. In late 2018, construction began on a $500 million expansion that would include a hotel, apartments, retail and offices. Included tenants announced were an Aloft Hotel, Pins Mechanical, and a Restoration Hardware flagship store named R.H. Gallery.

Gould, (August 22, 1911 – May 8, 1965) was a Canadian politician in Ontario. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1959 to 1965 who represented the downtown Toronto riding of Bracondale. He was a municipal alderman for Ward 5 in the 1950s. He died in office at age 53. Background One of five children, he was born in New York City to Russian- Jewish immigrants. His father, Zusha Goled was a tailor and cantor. His name was changed to Jacob Gold when he entered the United States at Ellis Island. His mother, Henyagitel (Annie) walked across Europe from Russia to take a boat to join her husband in New York. Along with his parents and older brother Max, the family moved from the Lower East side to the cleaner air of Toronto. Gould was captain of the Osgoode Hall debating team at the University of Toronto. He practised criminal law and entered politics at a time when restrictive practices posed numerous challenges and he changed his name from Gold to the more Anglo-Saxon Gould. Gould was married to Esther Freeman. They had three children Stephen, Marshall and Corrine. Stephen is a graduate of Berklee College of Music, an associate professor, and director of the Educational Leadership PhD program at Lesley University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Marshall is a writer in Toronto. Corrinne is the owner of Esther Gould's Finest, a Toronto business based on her mother's mandelbread recipe. Politics Gould was a revered member of the community, a tireless fighter for the \\"little man\\" and appointed as a Queen's Counsel (QC). He ran for the Liberal party in the provincial St. Patrick electoral district in the June 4, 1945 Ontario general election, placing second to Progressive Conservative Kelso Roberts. In 1950, he was elected as an Alderman, representing Ward 5 in the old City of Toronto. He represented Ward 5 until 1955. In the 1959 Ontario general election, he ran for the Liberal Party again, this time in the Bracondale electoral district, which was near Ward 5. He defeated the incumbent MPP, Progressive Conservative Arthur Frost, and would remain the MPP for this district until his death in 1965. Gould was a candidate in the 1964 Ontario Liberal leadership convention His candidacy was supported by Paul Hellyer who represented part of Gould's riding in the House of Commons of Canada. Death When Gould died, he did so coincidentally a few hours after Frost, the man he defeated to become Bracondale's MPP. Both men died on May 8, 1965. George Ben, the Liberal Party candidate that ran to succeed him, won Gould's seat in a by-election, and became that riding's last MPP, as Bracondale was abolished and redistributed into two adjacent electoral districts for the 1967 Ontario general election. When he died, Gould was married to Esther Gould. They had three children, who were in their mid-teens to early twenties at the time of his death.

She was the daughter of king (shah) Khosrow II (). She was the second Sasanian queen; her sister Boran ruled before and after her. Azarmidokht came to power in Iran after her cousin Shapur-i Shahrvaraz was deposed by the Parsig faction, led by Piruz Khosrow, who helped Azarmidokht ascend the throne. She was, however, the following year killed by Rostam Farrokhzad in retaliation for having his father killed. She was succeeded by Boran.  Name  \\"Azarmidokht\\" is the New Persian variant of her name used by scholars; her original name was Middle Persian, Āzarmīgdukht, meaning \\"daughter of the respected one\\", referring to her father Khosrow II (). Background and early life Coin of Khosrow II. Azarmidokht was the daughter of the last prominent shah of Iran, Khosrow II, who was overthrown and executed in 628 by his own son Kavad II, who proceeded to have all his brothers and half-brothers executed, including the heir Mardanshah. This dealt a heavy blow to the empire, which it would never recover from. Azarmidokht and her sister Boran reportedly criticized and scolded Kavad II for his barbaric actions, which caused him to become remorseful. The fall of Khosrow II culminated in a civil war lasting four years, with the most powerful members of the nobility gaining full autonomy and starting to create their own government. The hostilities between the Persian (Parsig) and Parthian (Pahlav) noble-families were also resumed, which split up the wealth of the nation. A few months later, a devastating plague swept through the western Sasanian provinces, killing half of its population including Kavad II. He was succeeded by his eight-year-old son Ardashir III, who was killed two years later by the distinguished Iranian general Shahrbaraz, who was in turn murdered forty days later in a coup by leader of the Pahlav, Farrukh Hormizd, who helped Boran ascend the throne. She was, however, the following year deposed and replaced with her cousin Shapur-i Shahrvaraz (who was also Shahrbaraz's son). His rule proved even more brief than that of his predecessor−being deposed after less than a year by the Parsig faction led by Piruz Khosrow, who helped Azarmidokht ascend the throne.  Reign  Coin of Farrukh Hormizd. When Azarmidokht was made queen of Iran, she stated that the management of the country would be the same of her father, Khosrow II. Farrukh Hormizd, in order to strengthen his authority and create a modus vivendi between the Pahlav and Parsig, asked Azarmidokht (who was a Parsig nominee) to marry him. Azarmidokht, however, declined. After having his proposal declined, Farrukh Hormizd \\"no longer shied away from the throne itself\\", declaring \\"Today I am the leader of the people and the pillar of the country of Iran.\\" He started minting coins in the same fashion as a monarch, notably in Istakhr in Pars and Nahavand in Media. In order to deal with Farrukh Hormizd, Azarmidokht supposedly allied herself with Mihranid dynast Siyavakhsh, who was the grandson of Bahram Chobin, the famous military commander (spahbed) and briefly shah of Iran. With Siyavakhsh's aid, Azarmidokht had Farrukh Hormizd killed. Farrukh Hormizd's son Rostam Farrokhzad, who was at that time stationed in the northeastern region of Khorasan, succeeded him as the leader of the Pahlav. In order to avenge his father, he led troops to Ctesiphon, the capital of the Sasanian Empire, \\"defeating every army of Azarmidokht that he met\\". He then defeated Siyavakhsh's forces at Ctesiphon and captured the city. Azarmidokht was shortly afterwards blinded and killed by Rostam, who restored Boran to the throne. After this incident the center of power for the empire possibly drifted to the northeast, which was the homeland of the Pahlav, and was the area where Yazdegerd III, the last Sasanian king of kings, ultimately fled to seek aid against the Arab invasion of Iran.  Coin mints and imperial ideology  During her brief reign, Azarmidokht had coins minted with the image of her father on the obverse, with the inscription khwarrah abzūd (\\"Increase in Glory\\") and the winged crown representing Verethragna, the name of the god of victory. On the reverse there is the regular late Sasanian fire- altar with two custodians. Her reason for putting her father was not so due to her gender, as it was not so significant compared to the rulers relation to the royal Sasanian family, and most essentially to Khosrow II, who was considered the last proper and legitimate king of kings of Iran. Azarmidokht's reason for minting coins with the image of her father was thus to restore his image and that of the Sasanian house, an attempt which was first made by Azarmidokht's sister, Boran, who did not however use an image of their father, but instead resorted to pay tribute to him by referring to him in her inscriptions. However, at the time when Azarmidokht ascended the throne, an inscription may have not been enough, thus resulting in the placement of Khosrow II's image on the obverse of the coins.  Personality, appearance and accomplishments  Islamic sources describe Azarmidokht as an intelligent and very captivating woman. According to the 10th-century historian Hamza al- Isfahani, the now lost book of Ketāb ṣowar molūk Banī Sāsān (\\"The Sasanian picture book\\") portrayed her as \\"seated, wearing a red embroidered gown and sky-blue studded trousers, grasping a battle-axe in her right hand and leaning on a sword held in her left hand.\\" The construction of a castle at Asadabad is attributed to her.

The roadway is planned as a controlled-access highway to move traffic from the southeastern suburbs of Phoenix to planned ones in northwestern Pinal County. It is the lowest-numbered state route in Arizona. The first mile from Loop 202 to Ellsworth Road opened on May 4, 2014. An extension to Ironwood Drive is planned to open in 2022, with the completion of \\"Interim Phase II. Planning for future sections has been halted until studies for the Pinal North-South Freeway are completed to confirm how the two freeways will intersect. In earlier planning stages, the freeway was formerly labeled State Route 802 (SR 802). Route description Route 24 is a controlled-access highway at the intersection of Loop 202's southern leg (Santan Freeway) and Hawes Road, extending southeast near the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport. Currently extending to Ellsworth Road, the future sections of the roadway plan to continue to the southeast, between the airport and the former General Motors Desert Proving Grounds, until reaching Frye Road, when it turns to the east. The road continues along the Frye Road alignment to the Pinal County line. Within Pinal County, Route 24 is planned to continue east, intersecting a future north-south freeway under study, and reaching an eastern terminus in the general vicinity of Florence Junction, where US 60 and AZ 79 intersect. History =Freeway origins= The first mention of a controlled-access highway facility in the Gateway Freeway area occurred in 2003, when the Maricopa Association of Governments's Southeast Maricopa/Northern Pinal County Area Transportation Study identified a freeway starting at Route 202, passing by the Williams Gateway Airport (now Phoenix- Mesa Gateway Airport), and extending east into Pinal County, having its eastern terminus at Route 60. This new freeway was listed as a \\"potential new regional facility\\" that would benefit from right-of-way protection. That same year, the Williams Gateway corridor was identified as a new corridor in Maricopa County's Regional Transportation Plan, with construction for the segment within the county planned in the 2016–2020 timeframe. However, the implementation of the plan was based on the assumption that the ½¢ sales tax dedicated to transportation would be extended past its expiration at the end of 2005. In November 2004, voters in Maricopa County approved Proposition 400, an extension to the existing sales tax funding transportation improvements. A portion of those funds are earmarked toward improvements of the county's regional freeway system, which experiences significant volumes of traffic in parts of the Phoenix Metropolitan Area. These improvements are made either through expansion of existing freeways, or the development of new freeway corridors. The Maricopa County portion of the Williams Gateway corridor, as a part of the county's Regional Transportation Plan, was included in the list of projects to be funded with the sales tax. In 2006, the Maricopa Association of Governments identified a preferred alignment for Route 802 within Maricopa County. The alignment travels southeast from Route 202, between the airport and the former General Motors Desert Proving Grounds, until it turns to the east at Frye Road, continuing eastward to the Pinal County line. In response to a projected budget shortfall of $6.6 billion brought on by the recession, the Maricopa Association of Governments voted to modify its Regional Transportation Plan by suspend funding to numerous projects during a meeting on October 28, 2009. The Williams Gateway Freeway was among the projects affected, since the construction of most of the Maricopa County portion of the route—the alignment between Ellsworth Road and Meridian Road—was deferred to 2026 or later. An interim roadway between the Santan Freeway and Ellsworth Road would still be constructed in the 2016–2020 time period. =Phase I= In 2011, the City of Mesa announced it would provide $148 million (2011 USD) to advance construction of the first mile of the freeway, between the Santan Freeway and Ellsworth Road, to provide access to the eastern side of Phoenix- Mesa Gateway Airport. The Arizona State Transportation Board moved construction of the interim facility from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2012, and renumbered the freeway to State Route 24. The interim facility will contain the semi-directional T interchange with the Santan Freeway, consisting of four one-lane ramps; additional traffic lanes on the Santan Freeway; a half-diamond interchange at Ellsworth Road; and a two-lane roadway mainline connecting the two termini of the roadway. On March 30, 2012, Mesa officials announced plans to start construction the following Friday near Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport. Mesa Mayor Scott Smith and Arizona Department of Transportation Director John Halikowski attended a groundbreaking ceremony for the Gateway Freeway, State Route 24. Mesa officials said in a statement that by issuing bonds, the city was able to speed up construction on the project by four years. =Phase II= Route 24's extension, opening in 2022, has been labeled as an \\"interim\\" phase. This is due to the fact that the freeway lanes will travel on the ramps and service roads at each intersection. Interim Phase II will build two general-purpose lanes in each direction. Ultimately, ADOT plans to have three general-purpose lanes, one auxiliary lane, and one HOV lane in each direction. These updates will coincide with the build-out of the actual interchanges at each new intersection, which anticipated to be completed during Phase V of Maricopa County's Regional Transportation Plan. =Further extensions= No specific alignment of Route 24 has been set within Pinal County. The study that would determine the preferred alignment for the state route was suspended to allow it to advance in conjunction with the study for the North-South Corridor. However, study maps from the Arizona Department of Transportation show that the freeway's study area in Pinal County runs between the end of the Maricopa County segment and the intersection of U.S. 60 and Arizona 79 in the vicinity of Florence Junction. However, no funds have been identified for the Pinal County segment.

It is the first implementation of an algorithm for generating 3D structures of arbitrary carbon nanotube connections by means of the placement of non- hexagonal (pentagonal or heptagonal) rings, also referred as defects or disclinations. The software is a set of tools dedicated to the construction of complex carbon nanotube structures for use in computational chemistry. CoNTub 1.0[1] was the first implementation for building these complex structures and included nanotube heterojunctions, while CoNTub 2.0[2] is mainly devoted to three-nanotube junctions. Its aim is to help in the design and research about new nanotube-based devices. CoNTub is based on the strip algebra, and is able to find the unique structure for connecting two specific and arbitrary carbon nanotubes and many of the possible three-tube junctions. CoNTub generates the geometry of various types of nanotube junctions, i.e., nanotube heterojunctions and three-nanotube junctions, including also single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs). Although the current version of CoNTub is v2.0, this version does not supersedes v1.0, as v2.0 is dedicated currently to only three-nanotube junctions, although the incorporation of v1.0 functionality into v.2.0 is planned. Nanotube heterojunctions can be generated only with v1.0. CoNTub v1.0 is organized in five Tabbed panels CoNTub[1], the first three being dedicated to structure generation, the fourth to the output in PDB format, and the fifth contains a short help section. CoNTub v2.0 has experimented a major redesign, and the panes have been removed, instead, a conventional menubar has been added where the type of structure to be generated can be chosen. Although the menu item for heterojunction generation appears in the menu, the button is disabled, so NTHJ's can be only generated with v1.0  Features  * 3D molecular viewer * Structure generation of carbon nanotube Heterojunctions from indices(i,j) and length (l) of the two nanotubes. * Structure generation of single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) from indices(i,j) and length (l) * Structure generation of symmetric Three-nanotube junctions (TNJ) selected from a list of possibilities, given the indices of the joined nanotubes. * Plotting the electronic band structure and density of states (DOS) for single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) * Structure generation of multi-walled nanotubes from indices(i,j) and length (l), number of shells(N) and spacing(S). * Output the xyz coordinates of the structures in a (PDB) file format  Nanotube generation  To generate a SWNT, it is only necessary to introduce the indices of the tube, its desired length (Angstrom), and the type of atom for termination of dangling bonds. ConTub displays the resulting nanotube, as well as its electronic band structure and density of states (DOS), following a tight binding model.Savinskii, S.S.; Khokhriakov, N.V. Characteristic Features of the Pi-Electron States of Carbon Nanotubes. J. Exp. Theor. Phys. 1997, 84, 1131-1137. MWNT - multiple tubes with the same axis and length - are created by providing the indices of the most inner tube (i,j), the desired length (l), the number of shells (N), and the approximate distance between shells or spacing (S) in Angstrom. The default value for spacing corresponds to the standard distance between layers in crystalline graphite (3.4 Å). ConTub automatically selects the indices of the remaining tubes, trying to adjust the interlayer spacing, and tries to use tubes with the same chirality as that of the inner nanotube.  Heterojunction generation This is the core of the CoNTub[1] program. Strip algebra was implemented, which allows two perfect carbon nanotubes to be joined, independently of their geometry, radius or chirality, with the simplest geometry possible, i.e. with the lowest number of non-hexagonal rings (a pentagon and a heptagon), also called defects or disclinations. There is always a possible connection between two tubes and strip algebra ensues that the solution is unique and depending only of the indices (i,j) of both tubes. C3 Symmetric Three-Nanotube Junction generation A further implementation of the Strip Algebra has been released in the second version of CoNTub, in order to elucidate the precise location of atoms and rings that lead to a junction of three nanotubes. Connection between three nanotubes requires, at least, the presence of six heptagons, instead of the single pentagon and heptagon required for an heterojunction. In this case, the set of equations that rule the geometry has more variables to solve than restrictions, so the possible geometries constitute an infinite set. The detailed procedure for the nanotube construction has been also published, Imposing additional restrictions to the geometry can ease the finding of viable geometries, and this is what is applied in the current version of CoNTub: Forcing the tubes connected to be of the same kind, and forcing an additional C3 symmetry, an automated way to construct the geometry can be found. However, even with these restrictions, the possibilities are still infinite. Therefore, a way to estimate the viability of the junction, even before constructing it, had to be developed. Given that non-hexagonal rings  Image gallery  Image:contub_v1.0_02.pngCoNTub v1.0 - 3D viewer panel (zoom in). Image:contub_v1.0_04.pngCoNTub v1.0 - 3D viewer panel (cutback and ball&stick; modes).

Legends In Polish literature Lech was also the name of the legendary founder of Poland. The legend describes three brothers, Lech, Čech, and Rus - who founded three Slavic nations: Poland (also known as Lechia), Bohemia (Čechy, now known as the Czech Republic), and Rus (Ruthenia). In this legend Lech was the founder of Gniezno. > Three brothers Lech, Czech and Rus were exploring the wilderness to find a > place to settle.

The lab is part of the Computer Science Department and Information Trust Institute. Its current research projects concern health information technology and critical infrastructure protection. Past projects addressed messaging, networking, and privacy.  Active projects  = Health Information Technology = The lab is performing work on the Strategic Healthcare IT Advanced Research Projects on Security (SHARPS) project. It is developing security and privacy technologies to help remove key barriers that prevent the use of health information by systems implementing electronic health records, health information exchanges, and telemedicine. = Critical Infrastructure Protection = Networked control systems such as the electric power grid use computers for tasks like protecting substations against overloads (digital protective relays) and metering facilities (advanced meters). The lab developed the attested meter to provide security and privacy for advanced meters, and has worked on security for building automation systems and substation automation.  Past projects  = Assisted Living Security = Advances in networking, distributed computing, and medical devices are combining with changes in the way health care is financed and the growing number of elderly people to produce strong prospects for the widespread use of assisted living, a health care approach which can benefit from transferring medical information collected in homes or dedicated facilities to clinicians over data networks. The lab explored security engineering of such systems through prototypes, field trials, and formal methods based on an architecture that uses a partially trusted Assisted Living Service Provider (ALSP) as a third party intermediary between assisted persons and clinicians. = Adaptive Messaging Policy (AMPol) = Scalable distributed systems demand an ability to express and adapt to diverse policies of numerous distinct administrative domains. The lab introduced technologies for messaging systems with adaptive security policies based on WSEmail, where Internet messaging is implemented as a web service, and Attribute-Based Messaging (ABM), where addressing is based on attributes of recipients. = Contessa Network Security = Although there has been significant progress on the formal analysis of security for integrity and confidentiality, there has been relatively less progress on treating denial-of-service attacks. The lab has explored techniques for doing this based on the shared channel model, which envisions bandwidth as a limiting factor in attacks and focuses on host- based counter-measures such as selective verification, which exploits adversary bandwidth limitations to favor valid parties. It is also developing new formal methods for reasoning about dynamic configuration of VPNs. = Formal Privacy = Many new information technologies have a profound impact on privacy. Threats from these have provoked legislation and calls for deeper regulation. The lab has developed ways to treat privacy rules more formally, including better ways to reason using formal methods about conformance and the implications of regulations, and about how to quantify and classify privacy attitudes to control the risks of new technologies. The lab showed how to formally encode HIPAA consent regulations using privacy APIs so they can be analyzed with model checking.

This 18th-century village outlasted the canal, being abandoned in the late 20th century with the construction of the adjacent Limerick Nuclear Power Plant. The village on about 18 acres of land were listed as a historic district by the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.Estelle Cremers, 2002, [ NRHP Nomination Form Fricks Locks Historic District] Enter \\"public\\" for ID and \\"public\\" for password to access the site. Frick's Locks is considered a modern ghost town and, although private property, attracts visitors. History 1906 topographic map of Frick's Lock showing canal and railroad. The nuclear plant was built to the northeast on hill 269. =Canal era= While some buildings date from the American Revolutionary War era, the village name was a result of the \\"Schuylkill Navigation\\" canal. The canal required construction, in the early 1820s, of a set of locks at that point along the Schuylkill River. Locks #54 and #55 were built on farmland acquired from John Frick and the village became known as Frick's Locks. The village thrived due to the economic stimulus of the canal. Eventually the commercial canal traffic declined toward the turn of the century and gave way to the railroad. Frick's Locks had become the singular Frick's Lock after the Pennsylvania Schuylkill Valley Railroad arrived and built a station with the latter name. The canal was filled in starting in 1942. While the railroad eventually declined after Conrail was formed on April 1, 1976, the village remained inhabited until near the end of the 20th century. =Nuclear era= In the 1960s, the then Philadelphia Electric Company (PECO) began the process of building the Limerick Nuclear Power Station immediately across the river from Frick's Lock. The station went on line in 1986. During the project, PECO acquired all the land around the station site, which included Frick's Lock. There are possibly conflicting stories as to the residents being bought out and relocated nearby and one that describes a 48-hour notice forced eviction. In any event the buildings were vacated and simply boarded up. There is evidence that some of the buildings were later occupied by an environmental study company retained by PECO. =Present day= In the late 1990s Paul S. Frick (1925-2014), in an effort to preserve the property along with family history, began compiling all of the historical information and then hired Estelle Cremers who lived in the area, to assist him. Paul paid for all the costs and work that led to the property being listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 21, 2003. In February 2011, East Coventry Township partnered with Exelon Corporation to preserve and protect the historic site. Under this new agreement, Exelon effectively donated the land and eleven historic structures at Frick's Lock Village to East Coventry Township, valued at an estimated $1 million. In addition, Exelon will spend close to $2.5 million to stabilize and rehabilitate these historic structures.$2.3M restoration of Frick’s Lock Village unveiled Ghost town Entrance to Frick's Lock, with a sign forbidding entrance to the site. Note the burned-out residence. Because of its reputation as a modern ghost town, Frick's Lock attracts many curious individuals and groups, including ghost hunters. Its isolated location and abandoned status also attracts vandals. The inclusion of the Frick's Lock in the 2005 book, Weird Pennsylvania, and numerous web photo essays of the buildings have increased its popularity. The web sites have also documented its increased deterioration, including the aforementioned vandalism and the collapse of some porch structures. As of March 2008, Frick's Lock remains a hotbed for many thrill seekers and vandals. Interest in the area has grown since a fire destroyed the Lock Tender's House in February 2008. Since then, Exelon has made numerous attempts to clean up debris from the property and to close up open wells and open buildings. Vandals continue with their destruction of the buildings. Police are now attempting to discourage the continued vandalism by citing all unauthorized people found on the property with trespassing.

In 2007, the species was discovered as a breeding bird in northern Israel.Basra Reed Warblers Breeding in IsraelBasra Reed-warbler returns... to Israel References Basra reed warbler Category:Birds of the Middle East Category:Birds of East Africa Basra reed warbler ","title":"Basra reed warbler"},{"id":"9485314","text":"Benhilton is a suburban parish in north Sutton, Greater London. It is dominated by All Saints Church, which is a Grade II* listed building designed by Samuel Sanders Teulon in a Gothic Revival style and opened in 1863. It also contains All Saints Benhilton, C of E Primary and Greenshaw High School. Benhilton is significantly elevated above the surrounding area. Great Grennell, the hill on which St Helier Hospital and Greenshaw High School is located, is up to 64m AOD at its highest point; Benhill to the south, approximately where Oakhill Road meets Thicket Road, is 60m; Angel Hill is 53m.http://en-gb.topographic-map.com/places/London-92172/ Benhilton mostly lies within Sutton North ward of Sutton Council but also includes parts of Sutton Central, Carshalton Central and The Wrythe; the four ward borders meet in Erskine Village. History =Origin of the name= Milestone marking Benhilton's northern boundary at Rose Hill, Sutton, erected 1745. The immediate derivation of the name Benhilton was from Benhill Farm, which stood close to the corner of Benhill Street and the High Street; it was the largest farm in Sutton and covered much of where Benhill Avenue is now. 18th century maps record the name as 'Been Hill' or 'Bean Hill', and in the late 15th century it was called 'Benehill' or 'Benehyll', suggesting that the farm grew broad beans, which were a staple food in the pre-industrial peasant's diet. The earliest recorded name for the area is 'Benhull' from the 1385 Carshalton Court Rolls. A 1912 history of Surrey refers to: \\"The district called Benhilton, properly Bonhill, Bonehill or Benhill\\"; the area to the east of Sutton Common and north-east of the village was known as \\"Bonhill Common\\" in the 18th century. =18th and 19th centuries= The oldest surviving structures in the parish date from the 18th century, both of which are milestones showing the distance to central London. In 1745, when the Jacobite rising had made manifest to the government the shortcomings of the roads for the rapid transport of troops, the route through Mitcham and Sutton to Banstead Downs, which had been the scene of a failed royalist rising by the Earl of Holland in 1648, was measured and milestones were erected. The first milestone is situated at the northern end of the High Street opposite the junction with Benhill Avenue. On the east side is the inscription: \\"Whitehall XI Miles. Royal Exchange XII Miles.\\" The second milestone can be found on the west side of Rose Hill next to Rosehill Park, heading north out of the parish towards Rosehill. On the east side is the inscription: \\"Royal Exchange XI Miles. Whitehall X Miles.\\" and on the northern side the date \\"1745\\" is also just legible. More writing on the north and south sides, probably showing distances to other towns and villages in either direction, is no longer legible. They are two of a series of milestones that marked the road from Westminster and London Bridge to Banstead Downs and, from 1755, the route of the turnpike road to Brighton. The two focal points of the area are Benhill and Angel Hill, the latter being where All Saints Church now stands. Although there is a local legend that the cutting was made on the orders of The Prince Regent (later George IV) to save his horses' energy on the journey to Brighton, the cutting was in fact made rather earlier in the 1770s on the orders of the local turnpike trustees, to drain the road towards the Green and prevent a buildup of mud and clay at the bottom. In May 1823, the journalist William Cobbett noted in his Rural Rides: \\"They have lowered a little hill on the London side of Sutton. Thus is the money of the country actually thrown away: the produce of labour is taken from the industrious, and given to the idlers.\\" The Angel Hotel, located at the northern foot of the hill, served coaches and travellers on the London to Brighton road until the coming of the train and the motor car made its use as a hotel redundant. It became a public house before it was sold in 2011 and converted into a Tesco Express. Sutton Common was enclosed in c.1810–12 and Sutton Green was reserved as a recreation ground. To the south side of the Green, a pond with a small island was built and in 1838 a weeping willow 'coronation tree' was planted to celebrate the crowning of Queen Victoria. Cricket was played on the Green, which lent itself to the name of a public house opposite the Green, \\"The Cricketers\\", a Grade II listed building which is now under threat of demolition (as at August 2016). There were still some open fields until Benhill Wood was enclosed in 1854–57, which enabled a coherent architectural development to proceed. The ecclesiastical parish of Benhilton was formed out of the parish of Sutton on 15 September 1863. Originally conceived as an estate for upper class housing by Thomas Alcock Esq., the landowner and lord of the manor, the development of Benhilton was rapid: where in the 1840s Sutton Common had only been two farms and some cottages, by 1868 there were some 29 large residences. Grand villas including Benhill House (later known as Benfleet Hall) and Sorrento Villa to the north of Sutton Green were built to take advantage of the commanding views to the Crystal Palace ridge six or seven miles away. A cricket ground was located to the north of Angel Hill, opposite the site which is now Rosehill Recreation Ground, and Greenshaw Farm could be found at what is now the corner of Rose Hill and Rosehill Park West, opposite the milestone. Building continued during the late Victorian period and some of the more prominent houses included Broomfields and The Grennell (both located on Great Grennell hill where Greenshaw High School now stands), Benhilton Mount (on the corner of All Saints Road and Benhill Wood Road) and Monksdene, Aysgarth and Elmsleigh, which now lend themselves to names of roads or blocks of flats. The largest and most prominent villa, Benhill House (later Benfleet Hall), was located on land between Benhill Road, Oakhill Road, Benhill Wood Road and Elgin Road on the plateau at the peak of Benhill. Once the roads had been laid out, Thomas Alcock seems to have preferred to sell off his land rather than develop it himself, and the site of Benhill House was bought by a Mr E.H. Rabbits, who owned a large boot factory at Newington Butts, in 1861. In 1890 the Hall was sold to William Appleton, a tea merchant, and there were other wealthy owners before, in June 1915 during the First World War, it was converted into a temporary military hospital, funded entirely by local donations. After the war it housed a private girls' school, before being demolished in the 1930s and replaced by more modest housing in the form of Benfleet Close. The two large detached houses on All Saints Road and Benhill Road either side of Grennell Road – one is now a care home and the other a nursing home – date from the 1870s and are probably the oldest surviving houses in the parish, although neither are listed buildings. The three detached houses opposite (on the south western corner of the mini-roundabout, on All Saints Road) date from the Edwardian period, as do the houses on the western side of Elgin Road. =20th century= In 1901, the population of the parish of Benhilton was 3,503. A gradual improvement in train services from London to Sutton and then the coming of the motor car made it easier for the most prosperous to live further from their daily work in London, and so by the turn of the century new building in Sutton was characterised either by semi- detached houses or by terraces of various degrees of modesty. As the captains of industry and the managers moved further afield, so the clerks moved in. A map of 1913 shows that the area was still semi-rural and had a working farm, Hallmead Farm (known locally as Skinner's Farm on account of the dairyman who ran it at the turn of the 20th century), in the area of Hallmead Road and Stayton Road. During the late 19th century, much of the area had been covered by brick works and kilns to produce building materials, and in 1913 there was still an active brick field between Gander Green Lane and Collingwood Road. Two abandoned pits, one to the south east of All Saints Church, and the other east of Benhill Road (now a recreation ground), could also be seen and smelt. Whereas the area south of Oakhill Road and around Sutton Green was largely developed by this time, the area to the north was still mostly fields, woods, allotment gardens and detached villas, with some semi-detached houses built, mostly to the west of Woodside Road and Brunswick Road in the direction of Sutton Green, and between Grennell Road and Hillview Road, the latter road having been laid out but not built. The local Surrey dialect is likely to have still been spoken by many of the working class at this time; usage declined during the 20th century as Sutton was absorbed by Greater London and Estuary English rose to prominence. Building of the Sutton Garden Suburb on open land to the north began in 1912 but was interrupted by the First World War; following an end to hostilities, building continued during the 1920s and 1930s. By the time of the Second World War, the parish was mostly fully developed and built-up; some streets and houses including the areas around Benfleet Close, Waverley Avenue and Grennell Road were, however, yet to be built. Curiously The Grennell, another grand late Victorian villa which became the new site of Greenshaw Farm during the early 20th century, had survived even though Benfleet Hall had not; it was eventually demolished in the 1960s to make way for Greenshaw High School. By the 1890s, Victoria Pond at Sutton Green had a reputation more for its smell than its looks and following many complaints it was cleaned out, and given a solid lining and railings. An elm tree was planted for Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee in 1897, and an oak for Edward VII's coronation in 1902. The pond served as an emergency water source during the Second World War but it was drained completely in 1955. A visitor in 1905 wrote of \\"the lovely old elms\\" edging the Green, which have now gone, as has a terracotta fountain, also placed in 1902 to commemorate Edward's coronation. The Thomas Wall Centre, which opened in 1910 as the Sutton Adult School and Institute The County of Surrey Electrical Power Distribution Company was formed in 1899; by the time that it supplied its first customers in 1902, it had become the South Metropolitan Electric Tramways & Lighting Company. Trams followed in 1906, running from Croydon through Carshalton (where the depot was located) to Sutton along Westmead Road, Lower Road, Benhill Avenue and Benhill Street, terminating next to the High Street. In 1935 the trams were replaced by trolleybuses, and the wires were extended up to Sutton Green, in order to provide a turning-circle. The trolleybuses were removed in 1959 once the internal combustion engine had made them redundant, and no visible traces now remain other than the notable width of the streets bordering the Benhilton area. The site of the former trolleybus terminus on Benhill Avenue is now a Salvation Army centre. The parish was only lightly bombed during The Blitz compared to some parts of London, with most bombing clustered in the area north of Sutton Green and around Angel Hill. At 11.30pm on 9 September 1940, two high explosive bombs blew out some of the stained glass windows in All Saints Church and damaged the adjoining National School. Further heavy bombing in the parish occurred on the nights of 10, 11 and 28 September and 8 and 29 November 1940. The school and vicarage were destroyed by flying bombs during the summer of 1944. The school was rebuilt and reopened in 1950; it was rebuilt again on the site of the old vicarage on All Saints Road in the late 1980s. The adjoining vicarage is relatively new and was built on the site of the previous building in 2014. A visible relic from the War can be found at the peak of Great Grennell in Rosehill Park East, close to the Grennell Road entrance, where a concrete tank trap was built into the hill to slow an advance by enemy tanks. It formed part of the Outer London Defence Ring. Benhilton today Houses at Woodend in the Sutton Garden Suburb Benhilton is mostly residential, comprising a mixture of Victorian and Edwardian town houses, inter-War detached and semi-detached houses, private blocks of flats and a low-rise council estate, the Benhill Estate, which underwent major refurbishment and architectural improvements as part of an extensive programme of work from 2011 to 2013. More modern late 20th and early 21st century infill is evident along All Saints Road, Benhill Wood Road and Woodside Road in particular. Benhilton is home to the long established Thomas Wall Centre,The Thomas Wall Centre a large Edwardian building available for public use. Originally called The Sutton Adult School and Institute, it first opened in 1910 and 1911. Named after the area's benefactor of Wall's sausage and ice cream fame, the Centre runs a weekly programme of events, provides rooms for hire and hosts an onsite hypnotherapist. The garage on the corner of Aultone Way and Angel Hill, built between 1910 and 1913 and which is still in use today, was originally used for the storing of the 'Stop Me and Buy One' bicycles of Wall's ice cream business. Weeping willow in Erskine Village As well as All Saints Church, a building housing the Korean Catholic Church in London can be found on the corner of All Saints Road and Benhill Wood Road. The Holy Family Catholic Church is located at Sutton Green. The Granfers Community Centre on Oakhill Road is a hub for various local voluntary and charitable organisations. The Benhill Crescent Horticultural Society maintains allotments on Benhill Road. 1st North Sutton Scout Group have their headquarters on Stayton Road and another building in Benhilton Gardens. Erskine Village, a small commercial area, borders the Poets Estate, an inter- War estate mostly comprising semi-detached housing with streets named after famous English poets including Lord Byron (Byron Gardens), John Milton (Milton Avenue) and Elizabeth Barrett Browning (Browning Avenue) among others. Benhilton is the location of the historic Sutton Garden Suburb. Local transport Bus at bus stop outside Thomas Wall Centre, Benhill Avenue Benhilton is well served by public transport, with local bus routes S1 (Banstead to Mitcham, through Benhilton from Sutton Green along Oakhill Road and Erskine Road) and S4 (Wilson's School, Wallington to St Helier along Benhill Avenue, Thicket Road, Oakhill Road, Benhill Road and Grennell Road) serving the heart of the area. Bus routes 151, 154, 164 and 280 travel between Sutton town centre and Rosehill via Sutton Green and Angel Hill, heading north to Wallington, Morden, Wimbledon and Tooting via Mitcham respectively; bus route 470 travels from Sutton Green along Sutton Common Road towards Colliers Wood. Other buses including the 213 to Kingston can be caught (heading southbound towards Sutton railway station) from the stop opposite Sutton Green and Victoria Gardens. Sutton Common railway station, which has trains to Sutton, Wimbledon, London Bridge, London Blackfriars, Luton and Bedford, is a short walk west from Angel Hill and pedestrian access to the main part of Benhilton is via a footbridge across the cutting. Local cycle routes 29 (Rosehill Park East/Grennell Road to Benhill Avenue) and 75 (Croydon to Kingston via Sutton, along Westmead Road, Lower Road and Benhill Avenue) pass through the area. Route 208 starts at Angel Hill and heads across Rosehill Park West to Wimbledon. Local economy Small clusters of local shops can be found opposite Sutton Green, around Sutton Common station and to the north of Angel Hill. A sub-post office was located at Angel Hill from the 1930s until it closed in late 2004. To the south east of Benhilton is Erskine Village; its small commercial area includes a convenience store, a pub (\\"The Butterchurn\\"), a pharmacy, a garage and a post office, among around ten establishments in total. The owner of the pharmacy, Reena Barai, was voted Britain's Best Pharmacist by readers of Woman's Weekly in 2014.Sutton Guardian Local geography References Category:Areas of London Category:Districts of the London Borough of Sutton ","title":"Benhilton"},{"id":"9485324","text":"Columbus Grove High School is a public high school in Columbus Grove, Ohio, United States, the only high school in the Columbus Grove School district.

Kime was bending over to help a young woman who was lying on the ground and being attacked. As he bent over, he was struck on the back of his head by Jerell Thomas. He fell onto the pavement and struck his head again. As he lay there, other rioters began to kick him. His friends and others surrounded him to protect him. As he lay dying in the streets, police officers stood on the sidelines and watched. His friends ran to the police and asked for assistance. The police were instructed they could not enter the riot zone, so they did not intervene. Off-duty fire department workers and his friends carried Kris out of the zone onto a nearby street. He was placed in a police vehicle, driven to Harborview Medical Center, and placed on life support. He died later the following night. The cause of death was listed as resulting from a fractured skull and subdural hematoma. Kris Kime's mother, Kimberly Kime-Parks, blasted the Seattle Police Department for letting the riots escalate out of control. \\"I always thought police were there to protect and serve, but they weren't there to protect and serve my son,\\" she said. Other people questioned why police didn't act sooner. In the wake of the riots, Mayor Paul Schell announced a moratorium on Mardi Gras celebrations in Seattle. Kime's family filed a lawsuit against the City of Seattle, claiming that the City enhanced the danger to citizens. The claim was based on the City's instructions that officers should stand by and not intervene. The lawsuit claimed this empowered and emboldened lawlessness as gang members and others brutalized innocent revelers. When the case settled, the family received $1,750,000 from the City, and annuity payments which would be used to set up a scholarship in Kris Kime's name. In addition a bronze plaque was placed in Pioneer Square in memorial to Kris's life. The attacker was identified by police as 17-year-old Jerell Thomas. He was convicted of second- degree murder in 2001. The conviction was overturned by the Washington State Court of Appeals. The appeal was based on a prior state Supreme Court decision ruling that an assault leading to death cannot be murder without intent to kill. In 2006, Thomas was retried and pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of second-degree manslaughter, receiving a 10-year jail sentence. However, due to previous time served and good behavior, according to his lawyer, Jeff Kradel, Thomas could be out of prison by late 2008. Jerell Thomas was released from prison in 2010. A CBS News story in March 2006 reported that Kime's organs had been made available for donation after his death. Five recipients received organ transplants. The five recipients of Kime's organs were invited to the wedding of Kime's sister, Kirsten, which was held May 2006.Organ Donor's Sister's Special Wedding  digtriad.com  References  Category:2001 murders in the United States Category:People from Auburn, Washington Category:2001 in Washington (state) Category:People murdered in Washington (state) Category:Murdered American students ","title":"Murder of Kris Kime"},{"id":"9485372","text":"Continental High School is a public high school in Continental, Ohio.

It borders the Upper Silesian Metropolitan Union - a metropolis with a population of around 2 million. Sławków is situated in the Silesian Voivodeship, previously it was in Katowice Voivodeship. The population of the town is 7,017 (2019). From 1999 to 2001, Sławków was part of Lesser Poland Voivodeship. When it was transferred to Silesian Voivodeship in 2002, it was assigned to Będzin County, despite being separated from the rest of that county by the cities of Dąbrowa Górnicza and Sosnowiec. It is the western terminus of the Broad Gauge Metallurgy Line. Location Sławków is located in western Lesser Poland, from Katowice, and from Kraków, in Kraków- Silesia Upland (part of Lesser Poland Upland), on the Biała Przemsza river. The town borders Dąbrowa Górnicza, Sosnowiec, Jaworzno and Bukowno. Apart from its historic center, Sławków has 25 smaller districts, and as much as 35% of the town is covered by forests. The name of the town comes from ancient Slavic given name Sławomir (Sławko, Sławek), and can be translated as The settlement of Sławko. History Archaeological sites from the Paleolithic and Neolithic ages have been discovered giving evidence to early human settlement in the area. The first written record of the town's name comes from 1220. However, the exact date of its incorporation remains unknown. Indirect written sources indicate that it most probably took place between 1279 and 1286. This assumption is supported by two documents from the 13th century: a charter issued in 1279 by Prince Bolesław V the Chaste, in which the locality is still called a village (villa episcopalis) and an agreement dated 1286 between the Bishop of Kraków Paweł z Przemankowa and Prince Leszek II the Black, in which Sławków is already called a town (civitas). In the 1280s, Bishop Paweł z Przemankowa built here a defensive castle, located near western border of Lesser Poland. Due to rich deposits of lead and silver, and location on a merchant route from Kraków to Wrocław, Sławków quickly developed, and in the 13th century it was one of the most important urban centers of Lesser Poland. In the 14th century its importance diminished, and later on, the town was destroyed several times in numerous wars (1433, 1434, 1455), as well as in a fire (1498). Furthermore, the deposits of silver and lead dried out. Until the Partitions of Poland, Sławków remained administrative center of properties of the Bishop of Kraków. In 1795 Sławków briefly belonged to New Silesia, and in 1806 was annexed by the Duchy of Warsaw (since 1815 - Russian-controlled Congress Kingdom). In the mid-19th century first industrial enterprises were established here, and the town was connected with other locations in the area by a paved road. In 1870 Sławków lost its town privileges, to recover them in 1958. In 1885 it got a rail connection with Kielce and Dąbrowa Górnicza, in 1887 with Sosnowiec. In the Second Polish Republic Sławków belonged to Olkusz County, part of Kielce Voivodeship. After the war, until 1975, it belonged to Kraków Voivodeship, then was transferred to Katowice Voivodeship. Between 1977 and 1984, Sławków was a district of Dąbrowa Górnicza. At that time the town grew in size, due to the construction of Katowice Steelworks.

Except for this one line, and a few very short stretches near border crossings, Poland uses the standard gauge for its railways, unlike Russia and the other former countries of the Soviet Union. The line runs on a single track for almost from the Polish-Ukrainian border, crossing it just east of Hrubieszów, to Sławków. It is used only for freight transport, mainly iron ore and coal. It is the westernmost broad gauge railway line in Europe that is connected to the broad gauge rail system of the countries which before 1991 constituted the Soviet Union. The line is managed by PKP Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa Spólka z o.o. company. Previous name of this line was Linia Hutniczo-Siarkowa (English: Metallurgy - Sulfur Line), but after sulfur ceased to be transported on the line its name was changed.

The original band members were Richard Collett (bass, born 31 March 1960), Peter Gamble (vocals, born 24 November 1960), Tony Scott (guitars) and Ian Gault (drums). Prior to signing to EMI, the band recruited George Beavis on keyboards. The current line up has Gary Kirby on drums and Paul Rocks on keyboards. Career The first single recorded, \\"All the King's Men\\"/\\"When the Twelfth of Never Comes\\", was a 300-copy promotional only release which led to a session for BBC Radio 1 following interest from Peter Powell. Shortly afterwards, the band signed with EMI Records. =Shades of Liberty= The band recorded tracks such as \\"Speed of Life\\" for the proposed first album, although Beavis was subsequently dismissed and replaced with Alex White. The resulting album was Shades of Liberty which received a five star review in Melody Maker headlined \\"Silent Classic\\". Singles such as \\"Young Hearts\\" and \\"Sticks and Stones\\" both failed to reach the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart, and the band never achieved the desired breakthrough. =Second album= The second album on EMI was prefaced with the release of the double A-side single \\"No Faith Is Blind\\"/\\"Business as Usual\\". Despite airplay and appearances on television shows across the musical spectrum (including Cheggers Plays Pop), the single only charted at No. 85 in the UK resulting in the band being dropped by EMI. This led to the situation of their second album on EMI getting cancelled before its designated release date. In a major coup, the band were subsequently picked up by Atlantic Records, becoming the first Irish act to join the roster of this American record label. White left in 1985 to work with Joan Armatrading, resulting in the band relying on session musicians such as Adrian Lee (Mike + The Mechanics), Clive Gates (New Musik) and Ian Curnow (Talk Talk; he was not really a stranger to the band, since he had already played keyboards on their 1983 debut single) to record the next two albums (Walk on Fire and Deep). =Atlantic= The first album on Atlantic (Walk on Fire) spawned a minor US hit \\"Sanctuary\\", but again the band could not make the elusive breakthrough. Gault departed the band after the initial recording of the third and final album, Deep in 1988 (demos for the unreleased fourth album are widely available), and was replaced by Gary Kirby. Paul Rocks joined the band at this time on keyboards, and the band finished recording the album with Frankie LaRocka in New York. They toured extensively after the album's release, but split up shortly thereafter citing a lack of record company support. The band reunited for one final performance at Belfast's Empire Music Hall to a capacity crowd in 1998. Recently, many of the band's videos, audio tracks and live performances have appeared on many social networking sites, raising expectations of a final swan song. =Reunion= In January 2018, the band reunited for the first time in twenty years, augmented by Callum Collett on guitar. In March 2019, Silent Running announced a return to the stage at Belfast venue 'Voodoo' promising songs from all three albums as well as \\"showcasing new material\\". They played to a sold out crowd in June 2019. A few weeks later, it was announced that they would play a second gig at Voodoo Belfast on 15 November 2019. In August the same year, the band returned to the studio for the first time in 30 years to record a brand new track titled \\"Lost Boy\\". The song was released as a digital download in October 2019. During the November 2019 gig, the band played two new songs; \\"Right Time Right Place\\" and \\"Shadowland\\". Both shows were filmed and are available to watch on the band's YouTube channel. Tours Silent Running supported John Foxx in 1983, Simple Minds on their UK tour in early 1984, and also toured with Robert Palmer and Talk Talk. During September 1984, they performed live on the Channel 4 music show The Tube. The band toured the UK during late 1985 and played live on BBC Radio 1 for the Radiothon appeal at the Birmingham Powerhouse.

Early life He was born on January 26, 1801 to Nancy Shepard and Seth Wetmore in St. Albans, Vermont. He was a sixth- generation descendant of Thomas Whitmore, who immigrated to Boston in 1635 from the west coast of England and became one of the earliest settlers of the Connecticut Colony.A Study of Chateau sur Mer Report II: Rites of Passage: The Wetmores of Chateau sur Mer His mother died on February 2, 1802. He had two stepbrothers Charles Wright Wetmore and Seth Downing Wetmore and one stepsister Nancy Shepard Wetmore. William moved to Connecticut with his aunt and uncle and was educated at Cheshire Academy in Cheshire, Connecticut.The Outbuildings and Grounds of Chateau-sur-Mer Paul L. Veeder, II The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, Vol. 29, No. 4 (Dec., 1970), pp. 307-317 Career William was mentored by an uncle, Samuel Wetmore, who was in a mercantile partnership with another uncle, Chauncy Whittlesey, in Middletown, Connecticut. In 1815 Samuel and his brother William Willard Wetmore moved to Providence, Rhode Island entering into a business partnership with the merchants Edward Carrington & Company.A Study of Chateau sur Mer Report I - The Wetmore Family and their Domestics Page 9 When William was fourteen years of age, he was hired aboard the ship Fame, bound for England, South America, and the East Indies.James Carnahan Wetmore, The Wetmore Family of America, (Albany: Munsell & Rowland, 1861) 357. In 1823, a trip on the Lion stranded him in Valparaíso, Chile. He took employment in Chile with the firm Richard Alsop of Middletown, Connecticut. This eventually led to a partnership of Alsop, Wetmore and Cryder in 1825 with John Cryder of Philadelphia. In 1829, he retired from the firm. =China Trade= Due to impaired health William's physician advised a career move to China. In 1833, he traveled to Canton, China and took over a partnership in Dunn & Company. He formed close ties with a junior partner Joseph Archer. He went on to establish a new merchant house, Wetmore & Company, with Joseph Archer. Wetmore's profit and loss ledgers from 1834-1839 reveal that the primary goods brokered by Wetmore & Co. were tea, tea papers, silks and spices. Lesser cargoes were wines, ports, opium, hemp, pearl buttons, copper and coffee. They also transported a variety of foreign currencies, and delivered Sunday newspapers. \\"Fast boats\\" were commonly employed for personal passages and letters. The company went on to be one of the largest mercantile houses in the East Indies despite the fact that Wetmore was opposed to the opium trade.Rhode Island Historical Society, The George Peabody Wetmore Papers, Mss 798, Boxes 22 & 23,WSW Biography prepared by Church of the Ascension, NYC During his time in the Far East, Wetmore collected a variety of Chinese objects, porcelains and china, which he imported home. It was in 1835 that the Maryland merchant George Peabody sailed to London on a mission to defer a United States banking crisis when states had begun skipping interest payments on bonds marketed in London. Peabody eventually enjoyed a huge success as a merchant banker in London and as a self-appointed American ambassador of the mercantile industry. He developed a form of wholesale banking known as merchant banks and became a leading dealer of American state bonds in London. It was through family and business connections that William S. Wetmore began a lifelong friendship with the prominent financier Peabody. =Later life= In 1844, he revisited his partnership with Cryder and formed the house of Wetmore and Cryder in New York City. He retired from the firm in 1847. According to Barrett in The Old Merchants of New York City, besides his success in the merchant trade, Wetmore acquired vast land holdings of 10,000 acres (40 km²) in Ohio and 70,000 acres (280 km²) in Tennessee and his net worth at retirement was valued over one million dollars.Walter Barrett, The Old Merchants of New York City, (1872), Vol. I, p. 299. Wetmore later left New York City and retired to Newport, Rhode Island where he bought of land. Personal life Chateau Sur Mer, Wetmore's home in Newport, Rhode Island, built in 1852 On October 24, 1837, William married his cousin, Esther Phillips Wetmore of Middletown, Connecticut, at Gloucester Lodge, Regent's Park, London. She was the daughter of his uncle Samuel Wetmore and a sister of Mary Cryder. The following year, a daughter was born in New York City, who died at birth or soon thereafter on October 12, 1838. Esther died on October 26, 1838. After her death, he married 21-year-old Anstiss Derby Rogers in Salem, Massachusetts, on September 5, 1843, daughter of John Wittingham Rogers.Rhode Island Historical Society, Boxes 22 & 23 They had three children: * William Shepard Wetmore Jr. (1844–1858), who died of scarlet fever in June 1858.A Study of Chateau sur Mer Report I - The Wetmore Family and their Domestics * George Peabody Wetmore (1846–1921), later the Governor of Rhode Island and a U.S. Senator. * Annie Derby Rogers Wetmore (1848–1884), who married William Watts Sherman on July 7, 1871.

In Newport, he built Chateau-sur-Mer, the first of the grand Bellevue Avenue mansions of the Gilded Age in Newport, Rhode Island. It is now open to the public as a museum. He furnished it with \\"strange and interesting\\" Chinese lacquer furniture and porcelain.Mrs. John King Van Rensselaer quoted in Our Social Capital (Philadelphia and London, 1905), p. 52 In 1860 he added a massive stone moon gate on the grounds from designs brought back from China.The Outbuildings and Grounds of Chateau-sur-Mer Paul L.

It is believed she lived at the Merlano Cottage in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. According to the 1860 and 1865 census, Mrs. Wetmore is not residing at Chateau-sur-Mer. Servants living at the house in the 1860 census were a butler, cook, laundress and chambermaid. Another resident in the 1860 census at Chateau-sur-Mer was a Wetmore cousin, twenty-year-old Lucy Dennison.A Study of Chateau sur Mer Report I - The Wetmore Family and their Domestics Page 11 William S. Wetmore conducted an active community life in Newport as a founder and incorporator of the Newport Historical Society in 1854, as the first and continuing chairman of the Newport Reading Room, 1854–1861, and as a Director of the Redwood Library from 1856-1862. Wetmore was one of sixteen Newporters who joined to contribute $16,500.00 to Touro Park. He was also elected Vice President of the innovative Butler Hospital for the insane in 1858, which initiated reform of treatment for the poor and insane. Upon William Wetmore's death on June 16, 1862, sixteen-year-old George and fourteen-year-old Annie were master and mistress of Chateau-sur-Mer.

The wing has been stationed at Wright-Patterson, known familiarly as 'Wright-Patt', since its activation in 1944 AS the 4000th Army Air Forces Base Unit (Command) in 1944, and from 1944 to 1994 undergone six redesignations. The wing's mission c. 2012 is to operate the airfield, maintain all infrastructure and provide security, communications, medical, legal, personnel, contracting, finance, transportation, air traffic control, weather forecasting, public affairs, recreation and chaplain services for more than 60 associate units on Wright- Patterson AFB. History The unit was organized by Air Service Command to provide custodial and support functions for Wright Field. The mission of both the unit and the AAF Technical Base expanded by early 1946, gaining full support responsibility for Patterson Field. The 2750th became host wing for Wright-Patterson AFB in October 1949, exercising command jurisdiction over the base, and providing services to Headquarters of Air Force Logistics Command and numerous tenant units. It frequently supported regional humanitarian missions, such as the Xenia tornado relief in April 1974. It provided logistical support and served as a port of embarkation during contingency deployments, most notably the Vietnam War in 1965–1973, as well as to the Middle Eat in 1990-1991. It deployed personnel to Saudi Arabia for 'Operation Desert Shield'/Desert Storm in August 1990-May 1991. After 1 July 1992 it provided logistic and administrative support for Headquarters, Air Force Materiel Command and the Aeronautical Systems Center, now known as the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, as well as on-base and off-base tenant units in a five-state area and managed base facilities and resources.

Iraq has multiple biomes which include the mountainous Kurdistan region in northern Iraq to the wet marshlands along the Euphrates river. The western part of the country comprises desert and some semi-arid regions. As of 2001, seven of Iraq's mammal species and 12 of its bird species are endangered. The endangered species include the northern bald ibis and Persian fallow deer. The Syrian wild ass is extinct, and the Saudi Arabian dorcas gazelle was declared extinct in 2008. Iraqi marshes The marshes are home to 40 species of birds, and several species of fish, plus demarcating a range limit for a number of bird species. The marshes were once home to millions of birds and the stopover for millions of migratory birds, including flamingo, pelican and heron as they migrated from Siberia to Africa. At risk are 40% to 60% of the world's marbled teal population that live in the marshes, along with 90% of the world's population of Basra reed-warbler. Seven species are now extinct or near extinction from the marshes, including the Indian crested porcupine, the bandicoot rat and the marsh gray wolf. The draining of the marshes caused a significant decline in bioproductivity; following the Multi-National Force overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime, water flow to the marshes was restored and the ecosystem has begun to recover.U.S. National Aeornautics and Space Administration. 2008 Aquatic or semi-aquatic wildlife occurs in and around these lakes: *Lake Habbaniyah *Lake Milh *Lake Qadisiyah *Lake Tharthar Water birds recorded in marshlands in southern Iraq include little grebe, great crested grebe, cormorant, darter, bittern, grey heron, night heron, purple heron, white stork, cattle egret, sacred ibis, eurasian teal, common redshank, pied kingfisher, greater spotted eagle, marsh harrier, hooded crow, Iraq babbler, crested lark, pin-tailed sandgrouse, collared dove, Indian roller and starling. Coral reef Iraqi coastal waters boast a living coral reef, covering an area of 28 km2 in the Persian Gulf, at the mouth of the Shatt al- Arab river (). The coral reef was discovered by joint Iraqi–German expeditions of scientific scuba divers carried out in September 2012 and in May 2013. Prior to its discovery, it was believed that Iraq lacks coral reefs as the local turbid waters prevented the detection of the potential presence of local coral reefs. Iraqi corals were found to be adapted to one of the most extreme coral-bearing environments in the world, as the seawater temperature in this area ranges between 14 and 34 °C. The reef harbours several living stone corals, octocorals, ophiuroids and bivalves. There are also silica-containing demosponges. Fauna A small Persian leopard population was recorded for the first time at the beginning of the 21st century in the border region between Iraq and Turkey. At least nine individuals were killed by local people in this region between 2001 and 2014. In 2012, the sand cat was recorded for the first time in the desert of Al-Najaf. In the 20th century, both Eurasian otter and the smooth-coated otter were present in Iraq's marshes, but populations have declined since the 1970s.

Between Bridgeport and Easton, Route 59 used to be the Stratfield and Weston Turnpike, which operated from 1797 to 1886. Modern Route 59 was designated along the turnpike route in 1932 with a northward extension to the Upper Stepney section of Monroe. Route description The route begins at North Avenue (US 1) in the Stratfield neighborhood of Bridgeport along Brooklawn Avenue. It runs in a northwest direction, briefly running along the Bridgeport-Fairfield town line for about before entering Fairfield proper. In Fairfield, the road is known as Stratfield Road and Easton Turnpike. Just south of the Fairfield-Easton town line, Route 59 crosses over the Merritt Parkway (at Exit 46). After crossing the Mill River bridge, Route 59 enters the town of Easton and the road name changes to Sport Hill Road. The road continues northwest towards Easton center then turns northeast along Stepney Road at the junction with Route 136. Route 59 ends at Main Street (Route 25) in the Upper Stepney section of Monroe near the Monroe Shopping Center. History By the late 18th century, the main road from the village of Stratfield (then in the town of Fairfield) to the village of Easton (then in the town of Weston) had become almost impassable and the repairs were deemed too costly for the towns to shoulder. In 1797, the Stratfield and Weston Turnpike company was chartered with the task of improving the said road and given the privilege of collecting tolls from travellers using the road. The toll road or turnpike, which was alternatively known as the Easton Turnpike, was in operation until 1886, when Fairfield County made all its turnpikes free. By the beginning of the 20th century, the state took over maintenance of most of the major through routes. In 1922, Connecticut began marking its state highways with numbers. By this time, the village of Stratfield had been absorbed into the city of Bridgeport while Easton had become a separate town (since 1845). The Stratfield-Easton route was designated as State Highway 306. In 1932, the state overhauled its highway numbering system. Most of old Highway 306 was renumbered as part of Route 59. Instead of turning west on Center Street in Easton center, Route 59 continued northwest to meet Westport Road (now Route 136). Westport Road and its continuation, Stepney Road, were both part of another old turnpike, the Branch Turnpike. Route 59 continued northeast along Stepney Road, ending at Route 25 in Upper Stepney. Route 136 was later relocated along the Westport Road section of the Branch Turnpike (in 1963).Connecticut Routes, Route 59 =Mill River bridge= The route's bridge over the Mill River in Easton, which carries more than 10,000 cars and trucks every day, has a substructure rated in critical condition by state safety inspectors. As of early August 2007, the bridge was one of 12 in the southwestern part of the state (including New Haven) with safety inspection ratings so low they are considered to be in critical condition. The ratings for these bridges were worse than the I-35W Mississippi River bridge in Minneapolis, which collapsed during rush hour on August 1, 2007.Kaplan, Thomas, Martineau, Kim, and Kauffman, Matthew, \\"12 state bridges are judged to be in critical condition\\" in The Advocate of Stamford, article reprinted from The Hartford Courant, August 5, 2007, pp1, A6 Major intersections References 059 Category:Transportation in Fairfield County, Connecticut Category:Transportation in Bridgeport, Connecticut Category:Fairfield, Connecticut ","title":"Connecticut Route 59"},{"id":"9485489","text":"El Zacatón, a cenote, with free floating grass island (lower right), Municipality of Aldama, Tamaulipas, Mexico Zacatón is a thermal water-filled sinkhole belonging to the Zacatón system - a group of unusual karst features located in Aldama Municipality near the Sierra de Tamaulipas in the northeastern state of Tamaulipas, Mexico. It is the deepest known water-filled sinkhole in the world with a total depth of . The deep Pozzo del Merro is deeper (actual depth unknown), but Using an autonomous robot, the underwater portion of Zacatón has been measured to be deep (a difference between the rim of cliff and surface of water adds to the total depth). Zacatón is the only sinkhole of the five located in Rancho La Azufrosa to have any noticeable water flow. The name Zacatón comes from the free-floating islands of zacate grass which move around on the surface with the wind. Scrapings from the rock walls beneath the surface yielded at least three new phyla of bacteria.  Diving  Zacaton sinkhole, cross-section El Zacatón's depth has made it an important dive site: * Dr. Ann Kristovich set the women's world depth record of during a 1993 dive into the sinkhole. * On April 6, 1994, explorer diver Jim Bowden and cave diving pioneer Sheck Exley entered El Zacatón with the intent of reaching bottom. Bowden dived to a men's world record depth of ,Zacaton. A History by Dr. by Ann Kristovich but Exley died, probably from high-pressure nervous syndrome (HPNS) at a depth of . * The NASA Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer (DEPTHX) project used the sinkhole as a testbed for robotic hardware being developed to explore the Jovian moon of Europa. DEPTHX was designed and integrated by NASA principal investigator Stone Aerospace. Additional co-investigators on the Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer (DEPTHX) team included Carnegie Mellon University, Southwest Research Institute, Colorado School of Mines, The University of Arizona, and the University of Texas at Austin's Jackson School of Geosciences.  Hydrogeology  Zacatón is just one of the numerous sinkholes and other karst features in the region. Here are located more than 15 sinkholes, several cave systems and karst springs with caves. Several of these karst features have unusual characteristics like travertine lids over several of the sinkholes with isolated waterbodies below. Since the late 1990s, Dr. Marcus Gary, a hydrogeologist at the Edwards Aquifer Authority and adjunct professor at the Jackson School of Geosciences, University of Texas at Austin has studied Sistema Zacatón to understand how the sinkholes formed and how they evolve over time.Sistema Zacatón During these studies, Gary made extensive use of a number of investigative tools, including those on the DEPTHX probe, geophysics, isotope geochemistry, field mapping, and geomicrobiology. Gary was a primary member and a principal investigator on the DEPTHX mission, which used an autonomous underwater robot to explore the deepest parts of Zacatón for the first time. According to Gary, these sinkholes began to form during the Pleistocene as a result of volcanic activity from below.Volcanic karstification of Sistema Zacaton, Mexico (Gary, Sharp, 2006) This view differs from the classical theory of cave formation and also hypotheses about the formation of other large caves in this part of Mexico. In this view, volcanism turned deep water slightly acidic by adding dissolved carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. This water slowly dissolved the limestone above, creating porous karst. This is referred to as “hypogenic karstification.” From time to time, overlying rock collapsed into hollow chambers below, creating deep shafts. If his interpretation is correct, Sistema Zacatón has more in common with Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone than with other deep sinkholes in this same region of Mexico. Another interesting hydrogeologic feature is that some of the sinkholes appear to be in the process of closing up at the top as crusts of travertine (a form of calcium carbonate) form at their surfaces.

These filaments of the cytoskeleton typically form through polymerization of α- and β-tubulin dimers, the basic building blocks of the microtubule, which initially interact to nucleate a seed from which the filament elongates. Microtubule nucleation occurs spontaneously in vitro, with solutions of purified tubulin giving rise to full-length polymers. The tubulin dimers that make up the polymers have an intrinsic capacity to self-aggregate and assemble into cylindrical tubes, provided there is an adequate supply of GTP. The kinetics barriers of such a process, however, mean that the rate at which microtubules spontaneously nucleate is relatively low. Role of γ-tubulin and the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) In vivo, cells get around this kinetic barrier by using various proteins to aid microtubule nucleation. The primary pathway by which microtubule nucleation is assisted requires the action of a third type of tubulin, γ-tubulin, which is distinct from the α and β subunits that compose the microtubules themselves. The γ-tubulin combines with several other associated proteins to form a conical structure known as the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC). This complex, with its 13-fold symmetry, acts as a scaffold or template for α/β tubulin dimers during the nucleation process—speeding up the assembly of the ring of 13 protofilaments that make up the growing microtubule. The γ-TuRC also acts as a cap of the (−) end while the microtubule continues growth from its (+) end. This cap provides both stability and protection to the microtubule (-) end from enzymes that could lead to its depolymerization, while also inhibiting (-) end growth. MT Nucleation from Microtubule Organizing Centers (MTOCs) The γ-TuRC is typically found as the core functional unit in a microtubule organizing center (MTOC), such as the centrosome in animal cells or the spindle pole bodies in fungi and algae. The γ-TuRCs in the centrosome nucleate an array of microtubules in interphase, which extend their (+)-ends radially outwards into the cytoplasm towards the periphery of the cell. Among its other functions, this radial array is used by microtubule-based motor proteins to transport various cargoes, such as vesicles, to the plasma membrane. In animal cells undergoing mitosis, a similar radial array is generated from two MTOCs called the spindle poles, which produce the bipolar mitotic spindle. Some cells however, such as those of higher plants and oocytes, lack distinct MTOCs and microtubules are nucleated via a non-centrosomal pathway. Other cells, such as neurons, skeletal muscle cells, and epithelial cells, which do have MTOCs, possess arrays of microtubules not associated with a centrosome. These non-centrosomal microtubule arrays can take on various geometries—such as those leading to the long, slender shape of myotubes, the fine protrusions of an axon, or the strongly polarized domains of an epithelial cell. Researchers think that the microtubules in these arrays are generated first by the γ-TuRCs, then transported via motor proteins or treadmilling to their desired location, and finally stabilized in the needed configuration through the action of various anchoring and cross-linking proteins. In the cortical array of plants, as well as in the axons of neurons, scientists believe that microtubules nucleate from existing microtubules via the action of severing enzymes such as katanin. Akin to the action of cofilin in generating actin filament arrays, the severing of microtubules by MAPs creates new (+) ends from which microtubules can grow. In this fashion dynamic arrays of microtubules can be generated without the aid of the γ-TuRC. Branching MT nucleation Studies using Xenopus egg extracts have identified a novel form of microtubule nucleation that generates fan-like branching arrays, in which new microtubules grow at an angle off of older microtubules. Researchers suspect that this process involves non-centrosomal γ-TuRCs that bind to the sides of existing microtubules through the augmin complex. This method of microtubule-dependent microtubule nucleation leads to rapid amplification in microtubule number, and creates daughter microtubules with the same polarity as the mother microtubules they branch from. It has been postulated that such a method could be important in the generation of the mitotic spindle. Role of Microtubule-Associated Proteins (MAPs) Though the γ-TuRC is the primary protein cells turn to when faced with the task of nucleating microtubules, it is not the only protein postulated to act as a nucleation factor. Several other MAPs assist the γ-TuRC with the nucleation process, while others nucleate microtubules independently of γ-TuRC. In the branching nucleation described above, the addition of TPX2 to the egg extracts led to a dramatic increase in nucleation events—while in other studies, the protein XMAP215, in vitro, nucleated microtubule asters with its depletion in vivo reducing nucleation potential of centrosomes. The microtubule-binding protein doublecortin, in vitro, nucleates microtubules—acting by binding to the side rather than the end of growing microtubules. Thus a family of proteins acting as nucleation factors may be present in cells, lowering, through various mechanisms, the energetic cost of nucleating microtubules. Several proteins are involved in formatting the γ-TuRC and temporal and spatial control of microtubule nucleation. These include, for example, coiled-coil proteins with structural functions and regulatory proteins, such as components of the Ran cycle. NEDD1 recruits the γ-TuRC to the centrosome by binding to γ-tubulin.

The family emigrated to the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland a couple of years later and remained there until 1960 when they returned to London, then Jersey. Baron was educated at Jersey College for Girls. She studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics and then law (changing subject after her first year) at St Hugh's College, Oxford. As an undergraduate she met her lifelong partner, John Pringle Nodwell Tonna, whom she did not marry until 29 January 2013 after she was diagnosed with terminal breast cancer. Legal career =Barrister= Baron was called to the Bar at Middle Temple in 1976 and became a QC in 1995. She specialised in matrimonial finance law at Queen Elizabeth Building (QEB) chambers, becoming the head of the chambers in 2000.Oxford Presentation, ox.ac.uk; accessed 24 March 2016. In 1997, she was described by The Lawyer magazine as \\"such a star, she is just excellent, and rated the highest. She is gutsy, thorough and very clever\\". Baron represented Jacqueline Cowan in her 2001 appeal against her divorce settlement. In the initial trial, Mrs Cowan had been awarded £1.7 million of her husband's £12 million. Following the appeal, Mrs Cowan's award was increased to £3 million. The case was one of the first examples of increased protection for 'business wives'. =Judge= Baron was made a Recorder in 1999. She was created a Dame upon her appointment as a Justice of the High Court (Family Division) in 2004. One of Baron's notable cases as a judge is NG v KR, in which she ruled that it would be unfair to enforce a pre-nuptial contract to restrict the amount of money a husband could claim from his wealthy heiress wife. Although she recognised that the pre- nuptial agreement would have been fully enforceable in Germany (where it was signed) or France, she held that pre-nups had never been legally binding in the United Kingdom. This approach was overruled by the Supreme Court in 2010, which ruled that pre-nups could be taken into consideration in divorce proceedings.

Wojkowice is located in the Silesian Highlands, on the Brynica river (tributary of the Vistula), and historically belongs to Lesser Poland. Its name comes from ancient Polish given name Wojek, which might have been a diminutive of Wojslaw. Several other locations in Poland have been named in a similar fashion – Wojslawice, Wojkowo, Wojkow, Wojkowa. The town has used to be in Katowice Voivodeship, but has been part of the Silesian Voivodeship since its formation in 1999. Wojkowice is one of the cities of the 2,7 million conurbation – Katowice urban area and within a greater Silesian metropolitan area populated by about 5,294,000 people.European Spatial Planning Observation Network (ESPON) The population of the town is 8,927 (2019). Location and districts Wojkowice borders the gmina of Bobrowniki, and the towns of Będzin (the district of Grodziec), Siemianowice Śląskie (the district of Przelajka), and Piekary Śląskie (the districts of Dąbrowka Wielka and Brzozowice-Kamien). In 2002, the area of the town was , out of which arable land was 61%. Wojkowice in its current form was created on 31 December 1961, out of the merger of two settlements (called \\"colonies\\"): Wojkowice Komorne and Zychcice. On 18 July 1962, Wojkowice was granted town rights. History The settlement of Wojkowice Komorne was first mentioned in 1271, while the existence of Zychcice (Zyhcych) was first documented in 1277. In that year, a Roman Catholic parish was opened in nearby Kamien, together with church of St. Peter and Paul. The area of Wojkowice was probably destroyed in the devastating Mongol invasion of Poland (1240s). Jan Długosz in his works mentions Wojkowice, but does not write about Zychcice. In the late Middle Ages, the area belonged to the Silesian Dukes of Bytom and Cieszyn, who after Mongol raids initiated a program of settlement, founding several new villages. In the 15th century the area of Wojkowice became property of Bishops of Kraków, as part of Duchy of Siewierz. In the 1470s Jan Długosz wrote in his Liber beneficiorum that Wojkowice Komorne was a village in the parish of Siewierz. The Duchy of Siewierz existed until 1790, when it was merged with Lesser Poland's Kraków Voivodeship. In the late 1780s, the population of Wojkowice Komorne was 214, with 32 houses. Iron ore was already mined in the area. Both villages (Wojkowice Komorne and Zychcice) remained part of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth until 1795. After the Partitions of Poland, the territory of former Duchy of Siewierz was seized by the Kingdom of Prussia, as part of the newly established province of New Silesia (Neu Schlesien, October 1795). According to Prussian data, New Silesia had the area of 2,230, with population of 52,000. Prussian authorities invested heavily in industrialization of the region. In 1797 they opened a small coal mine, and employed a number of residents of the province in the enterprises located in the Province of Silesia. During the Napoleonic Wars, New Silesia was annexed into the Duchy of Warsaw, ending 12 years of Prussian rule. In 1807, Wojkowice became part of Kalisz Department, Lelów- Siewierz County. In 1815, the Duchy of Warsaw was turned into Russian-controlled Congress Poland, remaining under Russian control until World War I. In 1867, Wojkowice was part of Będzin County, Piotrków Governorate, where it remained until 1918. In 1914, Zagłębie Dąbrowskie was captured by the Central Powers, and remained under joint German – Austrian occupation until November 1918. In the Second Polish Republic Wojkowice, with population of 4,000, was part of Będziny County, Kielce Voivodeship. After the Invasion of Poland, Będzin County was directly annexed into the Third Reich, as part of Gau Oberschlesien (Province Upper Silesia). In early 1945, Wojkowice returned to Kielce Voivodeship, but in August 1945 it was transferred to Katowice Voivodeship (until 1950, called Silesia – Dabrowa Voivodeship). Until 1954, Wojkowice was part of the gmina of Bobrowniki. In 1926, local residents tried to create a separate gmina of Wojkowice, but their efforts were rejected by the government. On December 31, 1961, Zychcice-Kamice was merged with Wojkowice Komorne. The new settlement was named Wojkowice and received town charter on July 18, 1962. In February 1977 Wojkowice became a district of Będzin, and remained so until January 1, 1992. Transport and industry Wojkowice lies from National Road Nr. 94, which goes from Zgorzelec to Kraków, and which is an alternative route of the Motorway A4. Furthermore, some away goes National Road Nr. 86 (European route E75). Wojkowice used to have a rail station on the route from Tarnowskie Góry to Dąbrowa Górnicza Zabkowice. In 1957–2006, there was a tram connection to Będzin. In 2001, Saturn Cement Plant was closed, and in 2006, Jowisz Coal Mine ceased operation. Wojkowice is home to a large prison (Zaklad Karny Wojkowice), which uses the complex of a POW camp, built by the Germans in the 1940s. The prison itself was opened here in 1959. Sports Wojkowice is home to a sports club Gornik, whose football team played in Polish Second Division in 1968–69 and 1973–75.

Biography John Munonye was born in Akokwa, Nigeria, and was educated at Christ the King College, Onitsha (1943–48), the University of Ibadan (graduating in 1952) and the Institute of Education, London. His first novel, The Only Son, was published in Heinemann's African Writers Series in 1966, followed in 1969 by its sequel, Obi, and then Oil Man of Obange (1971). Munonye spent three years as the head of the Advanced Teacher Training College, Owerri, retiring in 1972 (he would also give his last public lecture there, entitled \\"The Last To Go\\"). He worked for the Nigerian Ministry of Education until 1977, leaving to teach and devote more time to writing. His other novels were A Wreath for the Maidens (1973), A Dancer of Fortune (1974), and Bridge to a Wedding (1978), after which he published little. Criticism and style Munonye, unlike some of his contemporaries, professed a love for optimism in the face of colonial onslaught on traditional values. To him, the dialectical environment of African and western tradition can be seen in both a positive light and outcome for the common Igbo or Nigerian man or woman. An overriding theme in his novels is the focus on the common man. Munonye sometimes view the common man as being born into a position whereby he is already at a disadvantage, both historically and presently, He sees little difference to the fate of the common man who could be manipulated at the whims of elites and chiefs in both pre- and post-colonial Nigeria and during colonialism.

His father was Charles Nicholson and his two brothers, Charles and Sydney, were a church architect and church musician respectively. The Annunciation window at St John the Baptist, Wonersh, Surrey During his lifetime Nicholson is said to have carried out over 700 windows, including work in the cathedrals of Newcastle, Chester, Lincoln, Norwich, Southwell, Bradford, Worcester (the Edward Elgar memorial window) and Wells.The Times, 7 February 1937, p.14 col. b Nicholson designed the rose window of the south transept at the Church of Christ the King, Bloomsbury, along with a 1932 window dedicated to St Stephen Harding in the Musicians' Chapel at St Sepulchre-without-Newgate, both in London. The latter church also contains a memorial window to him, by Gerald E. R. Smith, with the following inscription: :\\"To the glory of God. In memory of Archibald Keightley Nicholson, Master Glass Painter, who worshipped at this church. This window is designed and carried out by the craftsmen of his studios as a thank offering for his life and friendship. 1871 - 1937.\\" The east window of 1902 at St John the Baptist, Wonersh, Surrey, is Nicholson's earliest commissioned work. It was installed in memory of two soldiers, and depicts Christ with St George and St Alban, both military saints. Nicholson also produced two smaller windows in the north wall depicting the Madonna & Child and the Annunciation. In St Wilfrid's Church, Mobberley is Nicholson's window to the memory of George Mallory the mountaineer, who died on Mount Everest in 1924. The Lady Chapel of Waltham Abbey Church contains three windows by Nicholson. They depict the Annunciation, the Nativity and the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. Work on a fourth window depicting the Epiphany was interrupted by the Second World War and never resumed. The East window behind the altar in the church of St Peter and St Paul's in Ewhurst, Surrey was commissioned as a memorial window for the 24-year-old Captain William Ralph Frecheville, executed after his capture on 9 January 1920 in Rostov-on-Don, Russia, whilst serving as part of the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War.http://www.ewhurstfallen.co.uk/Men-research/frecheville/frecheville.htm Several windows by Nicholson may also be seen in St Gabriel's church, Brynmill, Swansea. The largest of these is the great east window above the high altar which was dedicated in 1925. The principal figures are the archangels Gabriel and Michael, flanked by figures representing the Te Deum and with the Doctors of the Church in the lower panels. The style would appear to be a little dated, but the Vicar at the time was obviously delighted: \\"a triumph of the artist's skill\\", he wrote, \\"the beauty of the design, the richness and blending of the colours, the majesty of the figures, the expressions of the faces make it the grand and inspired conception of one who is at the same time a great artist and a devout Catholic\\". There are smaller windows on the south side of the sanctuary also of 1925-26 showing Saint Helen and Saint Catherine of Alexandria but in a more contemporary style. The windows in the Lady Chapel over the altar and on the south wall are by Nicholson and date from 1925–26. They depict themes related to the life of Our Lady. One of Nicholson's later commissions is the Nutman Window at the Church of St Sabinus at Woolacombe and which is dedicated to William John Nutman who received the Albert Medal First Class from Queen Victoria in 1896. The window was given in Nutman's memory by his daughters in 1936.Jean Dodds and Giles King-Smith, St Sabinus' Church, Woolacombe (Privately printed) (2013), pg 22 References External links * Category:British stained glass artists and manufacturers Category:1871 births Category:1937 deaths Category:People from Marylebone ","title":"Archibald Keightley Nicholson"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},I={class:"card-container"};function R(s,a,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉 your wikitable 🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",I,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const L=d(P,[["render",R]]),x=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/14.md","filePath":"drive/14.md"}'),H={name:"drive/14.md"},G=Object.assign(H,{setup(s){return(a,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(L)]))}});export{x as __pageData,G as default};
