He is responsible for the development of Clyde Blowers. In 2007, he was placed tenth on the Sunday Times Rich List in Scotland.Sunday Times Rich List: Scotland: Jim McColl (accessed 14 January 2009) The Daily Record reported in November 2008 that McColl had overtaken Tom Hunter as \\"Scotland's richest man\\" with an estimated fortune of ¬£800million. Biography Born in Carmunnock, the son of a butcher, McColl was raised in a small village outside East Kilbride, and educated at Rutherglen Academy. He left school at 16 to take up an engineering apprenticeship with Weir Pumps of Cathcart, Glasgow. After gaining City & Guilds certificates at lower and higher level, he gained a BSc Degree in Technology and Business Studies at Strathclyde University. He returned to Weir Pumps in 1978, studying during the next three years for an MBA. McColl joined Diamond Power Speciality Ltd in 1981, an engineering company supplying equipment to the power industry worldwide; during his tenure he studied part-time for a master's degree in International Accounting and Finance. Head-hunted by Coopers & Lybrand, in 1985 he became a consultant, working with companies in financial difficulties that needed guidance. The following year he left Coopers to become a self-employed \\"company doctor\\", during which he made money through two successful turnarounds. =Clyde Blowers= In 1992, McColl paid ¬£1million to buy 29.9% of family-owned engineering company Clyde Blowers plc; the company was then losing money on a turnover of ¬£4million, but had a full listing on the London Stock Exchange. After he took the company private and increased his holding to 70% in 2001, over the following five years Clyde Blowers bought six of its eight major competitors, and now has a 55% global market share of its original core business. In May 2007, Clyde Blowers bought Weir Pumps from Weir Group plc, the company at which McColl had started his career. In September 2008, McColl led a team which enabled Clyde Blowers to acquire the entire Fluid & Power Division of Fortune 500 multi-industry company Textron, in a deal worth over $1 billion. Clyde Blowers presently consists of 85 companies in 27 different countries, employing 5,000 people around the world, with an annual turnover in excess of ¬£1.35 billion. =Recognition= McColl was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2001 Queen's Birthday Honours. McColl won an \\"Alumnus of the Year\\" award from Strathclyde University in 1998,Alumnus of the Year was awarded an honorary doctorate by Napier University in 2003, and an honorary doctorate by Glasgow University in 2007. McColl won the Entrepreneurial Exchange 'Entrepreneur of the Year Award' for 1999/2000, and the Ernst & Young \\"Master Entrepreneur of the Year Award\\" for 2001. In July 2005, McColl was awarded The Prince Philip Medal 2005 'Certificate of Achievement' for an outstanding contribution to the engineering industry. In May 2006, McColl was presented with a Scottish International Business Achievement award from The Princess Royal. =Personal life= McColl and his wife Shona are now resident in Monaco. They also have a home outside Glasgow, and McColl is a keen car enthusiast for both modern and classic cars. McColl was a supporter of the Scottish Government's policy of independence for Scotland, but in early 2015 changed his view, stating that \\"the decision's been made\\" following the 2014 referendum; however, he supports the idea of further tax devolution. He is a member of the Scottish Government's Scottish Council of Economic Advisers, and spends much of his spare time working on a Glasgow-based welfare-to-work programme. The 2017 edition of the Sunday Times Rich List estimated his fortune at ¬£1.07 billion. 2010 rumoured Rangers takeover bid On 28 March 2010, it was reported in the Sunday Herald that, after discussions with the Rangers Supporters Trust about a takeover designed to make the football club a supporter-owned entity, McColl was believed to be backing the Trust's bid for Rangers. McColl later told BBC Scotland that he had no interest in any personal financial involvement, but was providing finance advice to the Rangers Supporters' Trust. McColl was part of a consortium, led by former Rangers manager Walter Smith, that attempted to buy Rangers from liquidators BDO for ¬£6million.

A counterfeit drug may contain inappropriate quantities of active ingredients, or none, may be improperly processed within the body (e.g., absorption by the body), may contain ingredients that are not on the label (which may or may not be harmful), or may be supplied with inaccurate or fake packaging and labeling. Counterfeit drugs are related to pharma fraud. Drug manufacturers and distributors are increasingly investing in countermeasures, such as traceability and authentication technologies, to try to minimise the impact of counterfeit drugs.Mark Davison, \\"Pharmaceutical Anti-Counterfeiting: Combating the Real Danger from Fake Drugs\\", Wiley, 2011, 426pp Antibiotics with insufficient quantities of an active ingredient add to the problem of antibiotic resistance.Counterfeit drugs: 'People are dying every day' BBC Legitimate, correctly labeled, low-cost generic drugs are not counterfeit or fake (although they can be counterfeited), but can be caught up in anticounterfeiting enforcement measures.Kaitlin Mara, Coverage Of Anti- Counterfeit Policy Debate Varies Widely Across Global Media, Intellectual Property Watch, August 2, 2010. Consulted on August 11, 2010. In that respect, a debate is raging as to whether \\"counterfeit products [are] first and foremost a threat to human health and safety or [whether] provoking anxiety [is] just a clever way for wealthy nations to create sympathy for increased protection of their intellectual property rights\\". Generic drugs are subject to normal regulations in countries where they are manufactured and sold.  Prescription and over-the-counter drugs  Bulk bag of counterfeit Viagra Counterfeit medicinal drugs include those with less or none of the stated active ingredients, with added, sometimes hazardous, adulterants, substituted ingredients, completely misrepresented, or sold with a false brand name. Otherwise, legitimate drugs that have passed their date of expiry are sometimes remarked with false dates. Low-quality counterfeit medication may cause any of several dangerous health consequences, including side effects or allergic reactions, in addition to their obvious lack of efficacy due to having less or none of their active ingredients. Since counterfeiting is difficult to detect, investigate, quantify, or stop, the quantity of counterfeit medication is difficult to determine. In 2003, the World Health Organization cited estimates that the annual earnings from substandard and/or counterfeit drugs were over US$32 billion. The considerable difference between the cost of manufacturing counterfeit medication and price counterfeiters charge is a lucrative incentive. Fake antibiotics with a low concentration of the active ingredients can do damage worldwide by stimulating the development of drug resistance in surviving bacteria. Courses of antibiotic treatment which are not completed can be dangerous or even life-threatening. If a low- potency counterfeit drug is involved, completion of a course of treatment cannot be fully effective. Counterfeit drugs have even been known to have been involved in clinical drug trials. Several technologies may prove helpful in combating the counterfeit drug problem. An example is radio frequency identification, which uses electronic devices to track and identify items, such as pharmaceutical products, by assigning individual serial numbers to the containers holding each product. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is working towards an electronic pedigree (ePedigree) system to track drugs from factory to pharmacy. This technology may prevent the diversion or counterfeiting of drugs by allowing wholesalers and pharmacists to determine the identity and dosage of individual products. Some techniques, such as Raman spectroscopy and energy-dispersive X-Ray diffraction (EDXRD)Williams, J: \\"Healthcare Distributor\\", page 81. E.L.F. Publications, Inc., December 2006/January 2007 can be used to discover counterfeit drugs while still inside their packaging. =China= The State Food and Drug Administration is not responsible for regulating pharmaceutical ingredients manufactured and exported by chemical companies. This regulatory lack, which has resulted in considerable international news coverage unfavorable to China, has been known for a decade, but failure of Chinese regulatory agencies to cooperate has prevented improvement.\\"Chinese Chemicals Flow Unchecked to World Drug Market\\" article reported by Walt Bogdanich, Jake Hooker and Andrew W. Lehren and written by Mr. Bogdanich in The New York Times October 31, 2007 On May 6, 2005, the Chinese press agency Xinhua reported that the World Health Organization had established Rapid Alert System, the world's first web-based system for tracking the activities of drug counterfeiters, in light of the increasing severity of the problem of counterfeit drugs. = India = ‚ÄúIf I have to follow U.S. standards in inspecting facilities supplying to the Indian market,‚Äù G. N. Singh, India‚Äôs top drug regulator, said in a recent interview with an Indian newspaper, ‚Äúwe will have to shut almost all of those.‚Äù According to Outsourcing Pharma in 2012, 75% of counterfeit drugs supplied worldwide had some origins in India, followed by 7% from Egypt and 6% from China. The Central Drug Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO), the drug regulatory authority of India conducted a nationwide survey in 2009 and announced that of \\"24,000 samples [that] were collected from all over India and tested. It was found that only 11 samples or 0.046% were spurious.\\" In 2017 a similar survey found 3.16% of the medicines sampled were substandard and 0.0245% were fake. Those more commonly prescribed are probably more often faked. Industry body ASSOCHAM wrote in the paper ‚ÄúFake and Counterfeit Drugs In India ‚ÄìBooming Biz‚Äù that fake drugs constitute US$4.25 billion of the total US$14‚Äì17 billion of domestic drug market. Around 25% of India's drugs are fake, counterfeit or substandard. If the fake drugs market grows at the current rate of 25%, it will cross US$10 billion mark by 2017. Trade in fake drugs is driven caused by lack of adequate regulations, shortage of drug inspectors and a lack of lab facilities to check the purity of drugs. Other key factors include storage of spurious drugs by chemists, weaknesses in drug distribution system, lack of awareness among consumers and lack of law enforcement. =Pakistan= The 2012 Pakistan fake medicine crisis revealed the scale of production of counterfeit medications in Pakistan. Over 100 heart patients died after administration of adulterated drugs by the Punjab Institute of Cardiology. Pakistan did not have any regulatory enforcement on production of medicines until this crisis occurred. In response to the crisis, a regulatory body was finally set up in February 2012. = United States = US FDA official inspects package suspected of containing counterfeit drugs at an international mail facility in New York The United States has a growing problem with counterfeit drugs. In 2012, tainted steroids killed 11 people near Boston and sickened another 100.\\"Bad Medicine\\", The Economist, Oct. 13, 2012 In another case, vials of the cancer medicine Avastin were found to contain no active ingredients. The vials were sourced in Turkey, shipped to Switzerland, then Denmark, finally to the United Kingdom from which they were exported to U.S. wholesale distributors. The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. wholesale distributor was hired by Canada Drugs, which also owns CanadaDrugs.com, a retail pharmacy website that sells prescription medication internationally, with a focus on the American market. In 2007-08, 149 Americans died from a contaminated blood thinner called Heparin that was legally imported into the United States. Investigated by the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations, the Albers Medical investigation is the most prolific example to date. On August 21, 2005, the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office for the Western District of Missouri issued a press release announcing that three businesses and eleven individuals were indicted for their involvement in a $42 million conspiracy to sell counterfeit, smuggled and misbranded Lipitor and other drugs and for participating in a conspiracy to sell stolen drugs. As part of this investigation, FDA initiated a recall of more than 18 million Lipitor tablets, which ranks as the largest recall in the history of criminal investigations of counterfeit medications. Participants in this scheme conspired to purchase and sell counterfeit, misbranded and illegally imported drugs. Foreign versions of Lipitor and Celebrex were smuggled into the U.S. from South America and re-sold after being re-packaged to conceal the true origin of the drugs. Counterfeit Lipitor also was manufactured in South America and then smuggled into the U.S. where it was co-mingled with the genuine foreign Lipitor and sold in the U.S. In addition, participants conspired to buy, sell and traffic almost eight million dollars worth of stolen Glaxo Smith Kline and Roche drugs, using fake pedigrees to launder the drugs and thereby concealing that they were stolen. There also were charges related to the sale of counterfeit Procrit, as well as counterfeit and misbranded Serostim and Neupogen. Procrit is an injectable drug used in the treatment of anemia and Neupogen is an injectable drug used by cancer patients to stimulate the production of white blood cells in order to decrease the incidence of infections. The FDA held a Congressional hearing in 2005 to review the situation. The U.S. is an especially attractive market for counterfeiters because 40% of worldwide annual prescription drug sales were made in the United States in 2007. In 2011, a \\"PROTECT IP Act\\" was proposed to deter advertising. Between 2002 and 2010, drug imports to the U.S. more than doubled, with 80% of drugs' active ingredients imported, now accounting for 40% of finished medicines. U.S. residents at greatest risk of exposure to counterfeit products through personal prescription drug importation are age greater than 45 years, residing in the south or west regions of the U.S., Hispanic ethnicity, college educated, poor or near poor poverty status, lacking U.S. citizenship, traveling to developing countries, lacking health insurance, managing high family out-of-pocket medical costs, having trouble finding a healthcare provider, self-reporting fair or poor health status, filling a prescription on the Internet, and using online chat groups to learn about health. Recent evidence suggests that provision of health insurance coverage may effectively reduce importation and the subsequent risk of exposure to counterfeit medicines, especially among particular subpopulations. = Africa = Fake antimalarial medication has been threatening efforts to control malaria in Africa. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2011, 64% of Nigeria's imported antimalarial drugs were fake. Nigeria is Africa's largest drugs market, and over 70% of its drugs are imported from India and China, considered the \\"biggest source of fakes.\\". Lately, Tramadol, a powerful and addictive opioid, has become a major problem. A huge black market has emerged, and an increasing number of addicts overdose and die. = United Kingdom = The MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency) are responsible for the regulation of prescription medication in the UK. Trafficking of counterfeit medication into the UK has become a growing problem, with ever increasing numbers of illicit drugs confiscated at the UK border. A large portion of the medication coming into the UK constitutes erectile dysfunction medication smuggled from abroad, one of the most popular of which is Kamagra (Sildenafil Citrate). To help combat the issue of counterfeit drugs, the European Union directive on false medicines was published on January 2, 2013. This came into effect on February 9th 2019 and requires UK licensed medicine to have a unique identifier (UI) and an anti tamper device on each pack of medication. In addition, every Pharmacy dispensing the medication is required to check the anti tamper device and update the FMD online system every time a pack has been issued.  Anticounterfeit platforms  In 2007, the world's first free-to-access anticounterfeit platform was established in the West African country of Ghana. The platform, dubbed mPedigree,Sample news report here: relies on existing GSM networks in that country to provide pharmaceutical consumers and patients with the means to verify whether their purchased medicines are from the original source through a free two-way SMS message, provided the manufacturer of the relevant medication has subscribed to a special scheme. Still in trial stages, the implementers of the platform announced in 2009 that they are in partnership with Ghana's Ministry of Health and the country's specialized agency responsible for drug safety, the Food and Drugs Board, to move the platform from pilot to full-deployment stage.allAfrica.com: Ghana: Country to Use SMS to Fight Fake Drugs (Page 1 of 1) A similar service is being rolled out in India. In 2010, NAFDAC in Nigeria launched an SMS-based anticounterfeiting platform using technology from Sproxil. That system was also adopted by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in February 2011. In April 2011, CNN published a video highlighting Sproxil's solution in the fight against counterfeit drugs in Nigeria. In July 2011, Kenya's Pharmacy and Poisons Board also adopted text message-based anticounterfeiting systems and endorsed the Sproxil solution. In early 2012 it was announced that more than one million people in Africa had checked their medicines using the text-message based verification service developed by Sproxil. An ePedigree is another important system for the automatic detection of counterfeit drugs. States such as California are increasingly requiring pharmaceutical companies to generate and store ePedigrees for each product they handle. On January 5, 2007 EPCglobal ratified the Pedigree Standard as an international standard that specifies an XML description of the life history of a product across an arbitrarily complex supply chain. Illicit drugs Illegal drugs can be counterfeited easily because no standards or regulations govern them or their packaging though some examples of illegal drugs are sold under \\"brand names\\" to indicate certain standards or dosage levels were being adhered to, as in the case of 1960s-era LSD, which was sold with patterns or logos printed on blotter paper. These illegal \\"brands\\" can also be counterfeited by drug dealers who want to be able to sell their products at higher prices. Counterfeit illegal and recreational drugs range from products which do not contain any active ingredients, as in cases where lactose powder is sold as heroin, or dried herbs such as oregano are sold as cannabis, to cases where the active ingredients are \\"cut\\" with a diluent (as in cases where cocaine is mixed with lactose powder), and cases where the claimed active ingredients are substituted by something cheaper (e.g., when methamphetamine is sold as cocaine). The use of diluents in illegal drugs reduces the potency of the drugs and makes it hard for users to determine the appropriate dosage level. Diluents include \\"foodstuffs (flour and baby milk formula), sugars (glucose, lactose, maltose, and mannitol), and inorganic materials such as powder.\\" The diluents used often depend on the way drug purchasers consume particular drugs. Drug dealers selling heroin to users who inject dilute the drug with different products from dealers selling to users who smoke or insufflate the drug; diluents which can easily form a solution with water for injecting heroin can be problematic for users who are sniffing the powder. When cocaine is mixed with diluents for the purpose of injection, the \\"...diluents can produce serious abscesses and pain if the user misses the vein and injects into muscle tissue.\\"Office of National Drug Control Policy - Publications - Pulse Check: Trends in Drug Abuse, Summer 1997 \\"Diluents and adulterants are often added to No. 3 heroin\\", including sugar, quinine, barbital and caffeine, some of which \\"can cause serious side effects.\\" Dr. Hirsch, the New York Medical Examiner, claimed that buying illegal drugs is \\"... like playing Russian roulette,\\" because \\"there is no way of knowing just what a heroin dealer has slipped into the packets.\\" In some cases, if a dealer does not take the time to dilute the drug with lactose or other fillers, a \\"very potent blend of heroin\\" is sold, which can lead to overdoses. Claims that illegal drugs are routinely cut with substances such as rat poison and crushed glass, often cited in antidrug pamphlets, are largely unsubstantiated. Some countries, cities and organizations deploy drug checking services in order to improve the ability of users to make a more accurate risk assessment. Packaging Custom package seals, authentication labels, holograms, and security printing, can be valued parts of an entire security system. They help verify that enclosed drugs are what the package says they are. Drug counterfeiters, however, often work with package counterfeiters, some of whom can be sophisticated. No packaging system is completely secure.

Prowling round the local butchers he watches the stock of birds gradually dwindle without having the opportunity to take one unobserved.

While he turns away for a few minutes to sharpen his knife, Rastus puts his hand through a hole in the wooden fence and seizes the bird. The hole is not large enough to pull the bird through, but Rastus tries to do so, with the result that he pulls three of the planks of the fence out, and with his hand through these and still holding on to the turkey like grim death, he bolts for home. Green starts in pursuit, but Rastus soon gets away from him, although he has many a laughable difficulty to overcome, for his stony brain could not see that he could take the turkey in the other hand and drop the three boards.

The Orions were sold to Germany and Portugal, resulting in the closure of the air base. Though officially closed as an airport, it still sees limited use for special events and by gliders and occasionally small piston aircraft, most of which from local flying club Aeroclub Valkenburg. Current plans however are to use the area for housing development, but part of the former air base may remain in use for glider flying. History Construction of the air base was commenced in 1939, but not completed before the start of the Second World War. Fights around the airfield during the Battle of the Netherlands resulted in significant losses on both sides. After Germany occupied the Netherlands, the German military completed construction of the air base for their own use, naming it Fliegerhorst Katwijk. It was used by the German Luftwaffe until 1943, when it was converted into a decoy airfield.Abandoned, Forgotten & Little-Known Airfields in Europe (2012) Valkenburg, article retrieved 22 March 2014.War over Holland, Valkenburg, retrieved 22 March 2014. After the war it briefly served as a home for the Royal Netherlands Air Force air transport wing, but in 1947 the Navy received control of the air base. After Ypenburg Airport was closed in 1992, many VIP flights for the government and the Royal Family moved to Valkenburg. The base closed in 2006 after the sale of the Navy's Lockheed P-3 Orion aircraft. The former air base still sees limited general aviation, mostly by the local Aeroclub Valkenburg. The area is expected to be redeveloped for housing however, with flying activities most likely being suspended in 2016.Aeroclub Valkenburg, website retrieved 22 March 2014. One of the hangars of the base has been converted into a theatre, and is currently being used for the musical Soldier of Orange. In March 2014 Valkenburg was used as the home base for both police and military helicopters providing security during the 2014 Nuclear Security Summit. The military stationed Eurocopter Cougar, AH-64 Apache and CH-47 Chinook helicopters at the former Naval Air Base for this purpose. For additional anti-aircraft protection, the NASAMS system was also deployed.

In 1846 Parliamentary approval had also been sought for the Birmingham and Oxford Junction Railway. The two lines would meet north of Fenny Compton, near Knightcote, and at Oxford the ORR would connect with the GWR line from . Parliament considered that the lines would provide useful competition for the London and Birmingham Railway which had become part of the London and North Western Railway. It gave approval subject to the lines being bought and operated by the GWR. To discourage the GWR from proceeding, the LNWR approached the shareholders of the Oxford and Birmingham Company individually to buy their shares with view to forcing the price as high as possible - resulting in questions being asked in Parliament., volume 90 However, while the Regulating the Gauge of Railways Act 1846 required that all new railways should be built to standard gauge, the GWR had been given a number of dispensations to continue with its broad gauge, including its lines from Oxford. The question arose of where the break-of-gauge should be ‚Äì Oxford or Rugby, volume 81 ‚Äì a dilemma the LNWR doubtless exploited. If the latter it would mean the GWR having a section of standard gauge line, including part of its Birmingham line. As a result, in August 1849 the section of the Rugby line north of Fenny Compton was abandoned. Then in 1848 Parliament ordered that the Oxford to Birmingham line be relaid to mixed gauge. By 1889 it was finally laid to standard gauge. British Railways closed Fenny Compton station to passenger traffic from 2 November 1964. The GWR line remains as the present day Didcot to line.

It runs between the north end of Pullens Lane on Headington Hill and Marston Road. History The land east of the Marston Road was part of Headington until the 20th century and was thus in the parish of St Andrew's Church. Under the Headington Enclosure Award of 1804‚Äì5, the Lord of the Manor of Headington acquired a plot that included the whole of Jack Straw's Lane. Jack Straw's Farmhouse, also known as Jack Straw's Castle, lay to the north of the lane, along with a brickworks between the farmhouse and the Marston Road. Until the 20th century, the lane had no name. It was originally a track at the end of Pullens Lane that led to the farmhouse. The name of the road dates from at least 1932 and the road was official adopted in 1954. In 1898, Cowley House (now a children's nursery) together with Cowley Cottage were built on the south side of the lane. Subsequently, other large houses were built on the lane, with a rural feel but close to central Oxford. Name Jack Straw is traditionally supposed to have been a farmer who lived on Headington Hill. Although many highwaymen were active in this area, no leader was ever found. However, when Jack Straw died, the cellar underneath his farm kitchen contained expensive goods stolen from merchants and travellers. The name has nothing to do with the Labour politician and former Justice Secretary Jack Straw. The name dates from at least 1932, although it was not officially adopted until 1954. Milham Ford School In the 1930s, Milham Ford School was built on a site between Jack Straw's Lane and Harberton Mead. It opened in 1938, became a girls' grammar school in 1944, and a girls' comprehensive school in 1974. The school was closed in 2003 and was sold. In 2004, the School of Health Care and Social Science of Oxford Brookes University started to use the building. This became the Faculty of Health and Life Sciences.

History A 1911 Railway Clearing House map showing Fenny Compton and the SuA&MJR.; It was opened by East and West Junction Railway between Stratford upon Avon and . The first section of the line to open was the Fenny Compton to Kineton section on 1 June 1871 followed by the Kineton to Stratford upon Avon section on 1 July 1873. There were two platforms to serve the passing loop on the otherwise single line. It was built side by side with the GWR's Fenny Compton station on the Birmingham & Oxford Junction Railway which had opened in 1852. The up platform was directly next to the GWR down, but because the latter's goods yard was in between, the E&W; one tapered down to less than 3 feet instead of the required six - something which the Board of Trade inspector ordered should be rectified but which was never done. In fact the Board of Trade had been extremely critical of the impecunious line. On the first visit of its inspector for, it had commented on deficient ballast, missing fish bolts, incomplete points interlocking, as well as poor fencing and lack of station facilities, such as name boards and clocks The line became part of the Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway in a merger of 1908 and at grouping in 1923 it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway. The LMS found it a useful link between its Bristol and London routes in competition with GWR goods traffic to the Capital. Initially the line had its own signal box, but in 1931 a new joint LMS and GWR box was built to the north of the station. This in turn was replaced by British Rail in 1960. Passenger services finished on the E&W; in 1952. Subsequently, the up platform was removed, and various connecting lines were installed to allow through goods traffic. However this never materialised because the line was closed as a through route in 1965. A stub of the Stratford upon Avon line remains as a freight line leading to the Kineton Military Railway. The GWR line remains as the present day Didcot to Chester line. Although the station trackwork remains much as it was, the platforms and most of the buildings have gone.

Upon leaving school he became a police cadet with the Wiltshire Constabulary and as such was one of the first on the scene of the April 1960 car crash that resulted in the death of Eddie Cochran and serious injury to Gene Vincent. He later recounted that he started learning to play the guitar using Cochran's impounded Gretsch over several nights at the station. He became a professional musician in 1962. His first group was called 'Dave Dee and the Bostons', who toured the UK and Germany and were a support act to The Honeycombs in 1964. Known for their variety act, which included comedy routines and risque comments interspersed amongst the song, the band came to the notice of Ken Howard and Alan Blaikley, changed their name to Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick and Tich, and were signed to Fontana Records, with whom they had a string of hits between 1966 and 1969.

She is considered the first officially recognized royal mistress of a French king. She was the subject of several contemporary paintings and works of art, including Jean Fouquet's Virgin and Child Surrounded by Angels. Life in the royal court Virgin and Child Surrounded by Angels (depiction of Sorel by Jean Fouquet) Born in 1422, the daughter of Jean Soreau and Catherine de Maignelais, Sorel was 20 or 21 years old when she was first introduced to King Charles. At that time, she was holding a position in the household of Rene I of Naples, as a maid of honour to his consort Isabella, Duchess of Lorraine. Sorel then went on to serve as the lady-in-waiting for Marie d'Anjou, Charles VII of France's wife and Isabella's sister in law. She would soon become his mistress. The King gave her the Ch√¢teau de Loches (where he had been persuaded by Joan of Arc to be crowned King of France) as her private residence. Soon, her presence was felt at the royal court in Chinon where her company was alleged to have brought the king out of a protracted depression. She had a very strong influence on the king, and that, in addition to her extravagant tastes, earned her powerful enemies at court. Sorel would become the first officially recognized royal mistress of a French king. Sorel generated scandal at court, particularly for popularizing the fashion of low- cut gowns. This behavior was both imitated and scorned. Jean Juv√©nal des Ursins, the archbishop of Reims, counseled the king to correct such fashions as \\"front openings through which one sees the teats, nipples, and breasts of women\\" (ouvertures de par devant, par lesquelles on voit les tetins, tettes et seing des femmes). Children and death Agn√®s gave birth to four daughters fathered by the king: *Marie, possibly born the summer of 1444 *Charlotte, who married Jacques de Br√©z√© (their son, Louis de Br√©z√©, seigneur d'Anet, in turn married Diane de Poitiers, a future royal mistress) *Jeanne While pregnant with their fourth child, she journeyed from Chinon in midwinter to join Charles on the campaign of 1450 in Jumi√®ges, wanting to be with him as moral support. There, she suddenly became ill, and after giving birth, she and her daughter died on 9 February 1450. She was 28 years old. While the cause of death was originally thought to be dysentery, French forensic scientist Philippe Charlier suggested in 2005 that Agn√®s died of mercury poisoning. He offered no opinion about whether she was murdered. Mercury was sometimes used in cosmetic preparations or to treat worms, and such use might have brought about her death. She was interred in the Church of St. Ours, in Loches. Her heart was buried in the Benedictine Abbey of Jumi√®ges. Charles' son, the future King Louis XI, had been in open revolt against his father for the previous four years. It has been speculated that he had Agn√®s poisoned in order to remove what he may have considered her undue influence over the king. It was also speculated that French financier, noble and minister Jacques C≈ìur poisoned her, though that theory is widely discredited as having been an attempt to remove Coeur from the French court. Her cousin Antoinette de Maignelais took her place as mistress to the king after her death. Legacy A 16th-century portrait after Jean Fouquet's 'Virgin and Child' Sorel plays a main part in Voltaire's La Pucelle. Two Russian operas from the late 19th century also portray her, along with Charles VII: Pyotr Tchaikovsky's The Maid of Orleans and C√©sar Cui's The Saracen. She is also a featured figure on Judy Chicago's installation piece The Dinner Party, being represented as one of the 999 names on the Heritage Floor. Two garments use Sorel's name in their descriptors, Agnes Sorel bodice, Agnes Sorel corsage and a fashion style named after her as well, Agnes Sorel style, which is described as a \\"princess\\" style of dressing.

He was known as \\"Mr. Role Theory\\" because of his contributions to the social psychology of role-taking.  Biography  Sarbin was born on May 8, 1911, in Cleveland, Ohio. He attended Ohio State University as an undergraduate and later obtained a master's degree from Case Western Reserve University. He received a Ph.D. in psychology from The Ohio State University in 1941. Sarbin began his professional career as a research- oriented clinical psychologist, practicing first in Illinois and later in Los Angeles. His academic career was established at the University of California, Berkeley, where he served on the faculty from 1949 to 1969 and at the University of California, Santa Cruz where he was a Professor of Psychology and of Criminology from 1969 to 1975. In addition, he served for varying periods on the faculty at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey. In 1987, he became a research psychologist for the Defense Personnel Security Research and Education Center (PERSEREC), a program of the U.S. Navy, where he continued to work until just before his death. In the course of his academic career, Sarbin received scores of honors, including both Fulbright and Guggenheim fellowships. He was a research scholar at Nuffield College of Oxford University in 1963. He was a Fellow on the faculty at the Center for Advanced Studies of Wesleyan University for the academic year 1968-1969 and returned there for another period in 1975.Wesleyan University He received the Morton Prince Award from the Society for Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis and the Henry Murray Award from the American Psychological Association. He was recognized with a lifetime achievement award from the Western Psychological Association in 2001. Just prior to his death, the American Psychological Association created a new award named after him, to be presented annually by one of its divisions, the Society for Theoretical Philosophical Psychology, and Sarbin was able to hand it to the first recipient.  Work  Role theory = Sarbin became known as \\"Mr. Role Theory\\" because of his seminal contributions and publications in the field of social psychology, relating to role-taking. Roles are socially constructed and can be used to explain a range of human behaviours including acting, shamanic possession, criminality, psychopathology, and hypnosis. Sarbin emphasised the difference between role- playing and role-taking, the latter being characterised by a greater degree of subjective involvement or identification with the role and belief in it. = Criminology = Sarbin's doctoral research used data gathered at the University of Minnesota to examine the relative accuracy of statistical versus clinical prediction for the academic achievement of undergraduates. As a young man Sarbin temporarily rode the rails as a hobo, and he felt this experience helped him to understand people excluded from the mainstream of society. = Psychopathology = Sarbin was particularly interested in the social psychology of psychopathology and argued that \\"mental illness\\" could be understood in terms of social constructs such as moral disapproval of the behavior in question. = Hypnotic susceptibility scales = In the 1930s, Sarbin collaborated on research on the measurement of hypnotic depth. In 1938, Friedlander and Sarbin introduced a composite scale based on a variety of responses to suggestion, and employing a standardised, scripted routine. Their work built upon earlier attempts by Davis & Husband (1931), Barry, MacKinnon & Murray (1931), and Clark L. Hull (1933). Instead of merely attempting to attribute hypnosis on the basis of certain ‚Äúspontaneous‚Äù signs, these scales deliver scripted suggestions and rate the subject‚Äôs response to each item on the scale, e.g., a score was given based on how long it took before a subject‚Äôs eyes closed in response to suggestions of lid heaviness, etc. The \\"Friedlander-Sarbin Scale\\" could be easily replicated based upon the script provided, and so norms were collated from different samples. The tests employed were, eye-closure, eyelid catalepsy, arm immobilisation, arm rigidity, finger lock, verbal inhibition (unable to say own name), post- hypnotic hallucination of a voice, and post-hypnotic amnesia. The Friedlander- Sarbin scale already contained a great many of the elements which were to become central to the influential Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scales (SHSS) in the 1960s. = Social role theory of hypnosis = Sarbin subsequently became an early and influential critic of the \\"special state\\" theory of hypnosis, which interprets hypnotic responses as the result of a unique altered (abnormal) state of consciousness. In a seminal article on hypnotism, the personality psychologist Robert White, had argued that hypnotic subjects were actively trying to enact a socially constructed role. > Hypnotic behavior is meaningful, goal-directed striving, its most general > goal being to behave like a hypnotised person as this is continuously > defined by the operator and understood by the client.White, R.W. 'A preface > to the theory of hypnotism', Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 36, 477-505, > October, 1941 Following White's radical interpretation of hypnosis, Sarbin used concepts from his own role theory, empirical research data, and analogies with other socially constructed roles, to argue in a much more rigorous manner that hypnotic subjects were not in a special state of consciousness but could be better understood as identifying with an unusual social role. Sarbin's views on hypnosis were detailed in a number of journal articles before being reviewed in more depth in his book Hypnosis: A Social Psychological Analysis of Influence Communication (1971), co-authored with William C. Coe. Coe had received his doctorate, with a dissertation on hypnosis, under Sarbin while Sarbin was at the University of California at Berkeley. (Sarbin and Coe became collaborators on the role theory model of hypnosis throughout Coe's life.) Sarbin's role theory model of hypnotism became an important influence on subsequent nonstate and cognitive-behavioral theories of hypnosis. = Narrative psychology = From around 1985 onward, Sarbin became focused on the subject of narrative psychology, a field in which he is recognised as a pioneer. He adopted a method based upon the primacy of stories as a way of understanding human behavior in preference to the constraints of traditional psychological research paradigms. = Report on homosexuality = Sarbin became known for his 1988 report critical of U.S. military policies regarding homosexuals. ‚ÄúGays in Uniform,‚Äù found no proof for the assumption that homosexuals posed greater security risks than heterosexuals nor the idea that homosexual soldiers would disrupt military life.

Its stated mission is to \\"eradicate abuses committed under the guise of mental health and enact patient and consumer protections.\\" Many critics regard it as a Scientology front group whose purpose is to push the organization's anti-psychiatric agenda. Efforts for psychiatric reform CCHR promotional leaflet, inviting members of the public to \\"report psychiatric abuse\\" The CCHR achieved an early victory in a 1969 Pennsylvania case involving Victor Gy≈ëry, a Hungarian refugee who had been committed to a psychiatric hospital against his will in April of that year. The police officers committing Gy≈ëry said he had tried to kill himself. Doctors at Haverford State Hospital, failing to realise that Gy≈ëry spoke very little English and was trying to address them in Hungarian, judged him \\"incoherent\\" and diagnosed him as a paranoid schizophrenic. The hospital refused Gy≈ëry's request for legal representation, and administered drugs and electroshock treatment to him against his will over a three-month period. An aide at the hospital eventually notified the CCHR, who, under an initiative led by Szasz and lawyer John Joseph Matonis, took the case to court and secured Gy≈ëry's release. The CCHR continued to lobby for legislative reform on mental health issues such as the keeping of detailed computer records on involuntarily committed patients and their families, and \\"drug experimentation\\" without patients' consent.Scientology's War on Psychiatry ,\\" Salon, 1 July 2005 The CCHR would typically request a tour of a psychiatric hospital, issue a public report based on patient testimony and other sources, and then push for legal investigations and reform. Its early focus was on involuntary commitment procedures. Since then, the group has organized media campaigns against various psychiatrists, psychiatric organizations and pharmaceutical companies, including Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of Prozac. One campaign is said to have caused a major fall in sales of Prozac, causing considerable commercial damage to the company. The group campaigned against the use of Ritalin for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, a disorder which the organization dismisses as nonexistent.Suits, Protests Fuel a Campaign Against Psychiatry, Los Angeles Times, 29 June 1990Kennedy Takes Aim at Ritalin Provision, Roll Call, 7 May 2003 The campaign was part of the Ritalin class action lawsuits against Novartis (the manufacturer of Ritalin), CHADD, and the American Psychiatric Association (APA); all five lawsuits were dismissed in 2002.317 F.3d 1097; 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 1678; 54 Fed. R. Serv. 3d (Callaghan) 1032; 2003 Cal. Daily Op. Service 970; 2003 Daily Journal DAR 1265. In 2003, the CCHR presented a report with the title \\"The Silent Death of America's Children\\" to the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, with case histories of several dozen under-aged psychiatric patients who had died as a result of psychotropic drug treatment and restraint measures in the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2004, the CCHR sponsored a bill requiring doctors to provide patients with information about a medication's side effects before prescribing any psychotropic drugs, while also mandating a legal guardian's signature. Opponents of the bill argued that these additional procedures might discriminate against mentally-ill patients while delaying treatment. The bill attracted widespread disagreement from the medical establishment, including the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health, who opposed it on the grounds that it compromised informed consent. The Massachusetts Psychiatric Society also opposed the bill, believing that it would interfere with the doctor-patient relationship. On 5 October 2006, National Mental Health Screening Day, the CCHR picketed outside of Riverside Community Care in Wakefield, Massachusetts, holding a protest rally against mental health screening. According to journalist Gary Band in the Wakefield Observer, \\"The protest fell somewhat flat because Riverside has not conducted these screenings since 2001.\\" According to a report from the National Center for Biotechnology Information the CCHR has uncovered real cases of faulty psychiatric care, which gave them some credibility; conversely, the CCHR has been accused of using pseudo-science and false information to disingenuously validate their claims . =Chelmsford Hospital and DST= From 1988 to 1990 the Australian government held the Chelmsford Royal Commission inquiry into Deep Sleep Therapy (DST). For a decade prior, the CCHR had been pushing for an investigation of the Chelmsford Private Hospital in New South Wales, and its head, Dr. Harry Bailey, who had been practising DST from 1963 to 1979. Australian Dictionary of Biography-Bailey, Harry Richard, pp 48-49, Melbourne University Press Honorable Justice John (J. P.) Slattery, Royal Commissioner, is quoted as stating that the CCHR \\"contributed considerably to advance the cause of the Chelmsford patients in their campaign for an open inquiry into the hospital.\\" The inquiry discovered that deep sleep therapy had killed 24 patients, not counting patients who had killed themselves, and close to a thousand had suffered brain damage. Chelmsford Private Hospital Patient Compensation-New South Wales Parliament-22 April 1991 Of the former patients, 152 received reparations from a fund totaling in excess of 5 million dollars. 'Inside 60 Minutes' Chelmsford Hospital was forced to close in 1990, and two of its psychiatric staff were made to face charges in 1992. Walton v. Gardiner, Herron and McDonald (1993) Dr. Bailey himself stepped down in 1979 due to the CCHR's protest campaign, and committed suicide by drug overdose in 1985, the night before he was subpoenaed to appear in court. Australian Dictionary of Biography, Bailey, Harry Richard, pp 48-49, Melbourne University Press His suicide note read, in part: \\"Let it be known that the Scientologists and the forces of madness have won.\\"The Melbourne Age, 22 April 1991. Documentaries CCHR have produced a number of documentaries promoting their view of modern psychiatry. These include Making A Killing, Prescription for Violence, The Marketing of Madness, Dead Wrong, and Psychiatry: An Industry of Death, which was made to accompany the CCHR's museum of the same name. =The Marketing of Madness: Are We All Insane?= The Marketing of Madness is a documentary which alleges that the mental health industry is an unscientific field driven solely by the profit motive, to the detriment of patients. One of the interviewees is Claudia Keyworth, an advocate of 'Bio-Energetic medicine' who believes that healing is best accomplished using the \\"energy field of the human body\\".Doctor Claudia Heals website, especially the Home and About Us pages On the topic of mental illness, she asserts: \\"they say you have a chemical imbalance of serotonin and dopamine, but there's never been a study to prove that, ever.\\" Simplistic \\"chemical imbalance\\" explanations for mental disorders have never received empirical support; and most prominent psychiatrists, neuroscientists, and psychologists have not espoused such ill- defined, facile etiological theories. However, this theory has been widely promoted by the press, advertising and professionals so that the majority of the general western public believes in it.Pescosolido, B. A. (2013). The public stigma of mental illness: What do we think; what do we know; what can we prove?. Journal of Health and Social behavior, 54(1), 1-21. \\"Furthermore, by 1996, a majority endorsed newer neuroscientific views for schizophrenia (77.8 percent chemical imbalance, 61.1 percent genetics) and depression (68.3 percent chemical imbalance, 50.8 percent genetics; Pescosolido, Boyer, and Lubell 1999)\\" The documentary claims that psychiatrists have convinced the public that normal negative human experiences are mental illnesses. An example used in the movie is the assertion that psychiatrists seek to label typical shyness as a \\"social anxiety disorder\\"; however, patients are diagnosed with a social anxiety disorder only at debilitating levels, where there is an \\"intense fear in social situations\\". Unlike a shy individual, a person diagnosed with social anxiety disorder is likely to suffer from symptoms such as nausea, stammering, and panic attacks. Controversies and criticisms The CCHR is often characterized as a front group for the Church of Scientology, which sponsors the organization. In 1993, the US Internal Revenue Service granted CCHR tax exemption as part of an agreement with the Church of Scientology International and Religious Technology Center (RTC) under which the RTC took responsibility for CCHR's tax liabilities. The CCHR has been criticized by journalist Andrew Gumbel for \\"crudeness\\" and \\"paranoia\\" in its criticism of psychiatry. Two scholars featured in the film Psychiatry: An Industry of Death, Holocaust scholar Michael Berenbaum and bioethics scholar Arthur Caplan, have rejected the attack on psychiatry and psychology. Berenbaum stated that \\"I have known psychiatrists to be of enormous assistance to people deeply important to me in my life,\\" and Caplan complained that he had been taped without being told what the film was about, and called the producers \\"smarmy and dishonest.\\" Funny? Yes, And Quite Weird, Too, Tampa Tribune, 22 Mar 2007 In 1988, the CCHR claimed that Professor Sir Martin Roth of Newcastle University had used LSD in tests on mental patients in the 1960s. The statements were publicized in the Northern Echo newspaper, which was ordered by an English court to pay \\"very substantial\\" libel damages to Roth after the court found that CCHR's claims were \\"highly defamatory\\" and \\"utterly false.\\" Jan Eastgate, President of the CCHR and winner of the Church of Scientology Freedom Medal, has been implicated in covering up the sexual abuse of an 11-year-old girl in the Australian branch of the church. Eastgate was head of the Australian CCHR at the time and the girl was abused by her Scientologist stepfather between the ages of 8 and 11 years. Eastgate, who denied the allegations, labelling them \\"egregiously false\\", was arrested on 30 March 2011 on charges of perverting the course of justice but later released on conditional bail. All charges were dropped against Eastgate after an investigation by the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecution found that there was not enough substantiating evidence. In the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks, CCHR promulgated a conspiracy theory assigning responsibility for the attacks to Ayman al-Zawahiri, alleging that, as Osama bin Laden's personal psychiatrist (although he is actually a surgeon), he was the principal mastermind behind the attacks and had brainwashed bin Laden using pain, drugs and hypnosis.

The game does have some blood, but it lacks gore; a small red splotch will appear on the chest of the targets that are hit. The screen scrolls from left to right, with terrorists or hostages popping out of windows and doors. Unlike other shooters, the powerups (being either energy, ammo or weapons) are obtained by shooting the lower-right box when an item appears there. After every two stages, a bonus game can be played for bonus points. This bonus game is a word game similar to Hangman, in which the player shoots letters to uncover the word. During this game, the player can have 5 misses. If the player gets 5 wrong letters or the timer runs out, the bonus game ends without any earned bonus points. If the word is completely revealed, the player gets a time bonus.

Home games are played at the Stade Fontvielle  History  The club was founded in 1955 at a time when new clubs were starting up in rugby league, as the French national team were enjoying what would be their best period at international level. It would take Salses until 1986 to appear in their first final, defeated by Ornaisons XIII 10-16 in the Federal Division, now known as the National Division 2 league. In 2000 they merged with local side Opoul XIII to become Salses Opoul XIII this partnership would last for seven years, when both clubs reverted to their original names. During this joint partnership the newly named club reached five finals and won them all. In 2002/03 they lifted the Federal Division and earned promotion after defeating Le Mas Agenais XIII 36-22 in the final. Two Coupe Falcou wins arrived in 2004 and 2005 the latter was the start of a league and cup double as they went on and won the National 2 now called National Division 1 league final against Baroudeurs de Pia XIII 36-20. In 2007 the Paul Dejean Cup was won for the first time after victory over Montpellier Red Devils 38-20. After the two clubs went their separate ways Salses continued to be the more prominent of the two, despite a double relegation back to the bottom tier, the fortunes of their former partners Opoul XIII were worse as they called it a day. In 2013 Salses reached their second Paul Dejean Cup final but this time went down 10-37 against Villeghailhenc-Aragon XIII.

Several manga series have been developed based on the Neon Genesis Evangelion anime series created by Gainax. While the first manga is a direct adaptation of the anime series, the following ones are spin- off series with several differences. The first manga from the series is entitled simply Neon Genesis Evangelion, written and illustrated by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, who also worked in the character designs from the anime. The manga closely follows the anime story with few changes made to the characters or certain events. The series was serialized in Sh≈çnen Ace from Kadokawa Shoten starting in 1995, but it was put on hiatus until July 2009 when it resumed in the first issue of Kadokawa's Young Ace. The series finally concluded with its 95th chapter in June 2013. Additionally, Fumino Hayashi authored the spin-off series called Neon Genesis Evangelion: Angelic Days, which focuses on the romantic relationships between the main characters. Kadokawa Shoten serialized the series in Monthly Asuka and collected the series into six tank≈çbon volumes. The volumes were published from February 17, 2004 to December 17, 2005. In the United States, Newtype USA serialized the series, while ADV Manga released the six volumes. Another series having a similar focus is Neon Genesis Evangelion: Shinji Ikari Raising Project, authored by Osamu Takahashi. Sh≈çnen Ace had published the chapters from June 2005 to February 2016, with 18 tank≈çbon having been released. Dark Horse Comics has licensed the series for English release, while the first volume was released on July 8, 2009. Min Min has also authored Neon Genesis Evangelion: Campus Apocalypse, which uses the same setting from the manga series, but a big difference from the Evangelions and the main characters. It was published in Monthly Asuka from October 2007 to December 2009, and it has been collected into four tank≈çbon volumes. Another manga named Neon Genesis Evangelion: The Shinji Ikari Detective Diary started serialization in Asukas February 24, 2010 issue and is authored by Takumi Yoshimura in collaboration with Gainax and Khara. As the title indicates, this series re-envisions Shinji as a detective. Volume one was released by Dark Horse Comics in September 2013. A light novel series Neon Genesis Evangelion: ANIMA was serialized from January 2008 to April 2013 in Dengeki Hobby Magazine from ASCII Media Works. The series set in an alternate future diverging from the events of the anime. The novel begins 3 years after the end of the Human Instrumentality Project, replacing episodes 25 and 26 of the anime, as well as the End of Evangelion film.

He remained chairman of the county education committee up until the time of his death. He also served as a Justice of the Peace in Lancashire. =Parliament= Harvey first stood for Parliament at the Khaki election of 1900 as Liberal candidate for Rochdale. The election was fought in the jingoistic atmosphere of the Second Boer War which favoured the Conservatives. Despite taking the anti-war side Harvey still managed to come within 19 votes of beating the sitting Conservative MP, Clement Royds. Harvey was elected as MP for Rochdale, however, at the 1906 general election beating Royds, who had held the seat since 1895, by 1,463 votes. He held the seat at the general elections of January and December 1910. He was on the extreme pacifist wing of the party and led the opposition to increased naval spending as World War One approached. The economist Francis Hirst wrote an approving biography of him. Harvey was interested in the environment and in being a benevolent employer and some of his public works still survive in Littleborough. Death Harvey was obliged to stand down from Parliament at the 1918 general election because of a disease of the throat, presumably cancer. He had to undergo two operations as a result but died at Windermere from the illness aged 63 years.The Times, 8 November 1922 p1 His family remained active in Liberal politics, his nephew Charles standing unsuccessfully for Rochdale in 1945 and another nephew Alexander sponsoring the young Cyril Smith to become a Liberal agent.

Historically, a bureaucracy was a government administration managed by departments staffed with non-elected officials. Today, bureaucracy is the administrative system governing any large institution, whether publicly owned or privately owned.Weber, Max \\"Bureaucracy\\" in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, translated and edited by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, Palgrave-Macmillan 2015. p. 114 The public administration in many countries is an example of a bureaucracy, but so is the centralized hierarchical structure of a business firm. Bureaucracy as a political theory is mainly a centralized form of management and tends to be differentiated from adhocracy, in which management is decentralized. Various commentators have noted the necessity of bureaucracies in modern society. The German sociologist Max Weber argued that bureaucracy constitutes the most efficient and rational way in which human activity can be organized and that systematic processes and organized hierarchies are necessary to maintain order, maximize efficiency, and eliminate favoritism. On the other hand, Weber also saw unfettered bureaucracy as a threat to individual freedom, with the potential of trapping individuals in an impersonal \\"iron cage\\" of rule-based, rational control. Modern bureaucracy has been defined as comprising four features: hierarchy (clearly defined spheres of competence and divisions of labor), continuity (a structure where administrators have a full-time salary and advance within the structure), impersonality (prescribed rules and operating rules rather than arbitrary actions), and expertise (officials are chosen according to merit, have been trained, and hold access to knowledge). Etymology and usage The term \\"bureaucracy\\" originated in the French language: it combines the French word bureau ‚Äì desk or office ‚Äì with the Greek word Œ∫œÅŒ¨œÑŒøœÇ (kratos) ‚Äì rule or political power. The French economist Jacques Claude Marie Vincent de Gournay (1712-1759) coined the word in the mid-18th century.. Gournay never wrote the term down but a letter from a contemporary later quoted him: The first known English-language use dates to 1818 with Irish novelist Lady Morgan referring to the apparatus used by the British to subjugate their Irish colony as \\"the Bureaucratie, or office tyranny, by which Ireland has so long been governed.\\" By the mid-19th century the word appeared in a more neutral sense, referring to a system of public administration in which offices were held by unelected career officials. In this context \\"bureaucracy\\" was seen as a distinct form of management, often subservient to a monarchy. In the 1920s the German sociologist Max Weber expanded the definition to include any system of administration conducted by trained professionals according to fixed rules. Weber saw bureaucracy as a relatively positive development; however, by 1944 the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises opined in the context of his experience in the Nazi regime that the term bureaucracy was \\"always applied with an opprobrious connotation,\\" and by 1957 the American sociologist Robert Merton suggested that the term \\"bureaucrat\\" had become an \\"epithet, a Schimpfwort\\" in some circumstances. The word \\"bureaucracy\\" is also used in politics and government with a disapproving tone to disparage official rules that make it difficult to do things. In workplaces, the word is used very often to blame complicated rules, processes, and written work that make it hard to get something done. Socio-bureaucracy would then refer to certain social influences that may affect the function of a society. HistoryAncient= Students competed in imperial examinations to receive a position in the bureaucracy of Imperial China. Although the term \\"bureaucracy\\" first originated in the mid-18th century, organized and consistent administrative systems existed much earlier. The development of writing ( 3500 BC) and the use of documents was critical to the administration of this system, and the first definitive emergence of bureaucracy occurred in ancient Sumer, where an emergent class of scribes used clay tablets to administer the harvest and to allocate its spoils.Compare: Ancient Egypt also had a hereditary class of scribes that administered the civil-service bureaucracy. A hierarchy of regional proconsuls and their deputies administered the Roman Empire. The reforms of Diocletian (Emperor from 284 to 305) doubled the number of administrative districts and led to a large-scale expansion of Roman bureaucracy.As taken from the Laterculus Veronensis or Verona List, reproduced in Barnes, New Empire, chs. 12‚Äì13 (with corrections in T.D. Barnes, \\"Emperors, panegyrics, prefects, provinces and palaces (284‚Äì317)\\", Journal of Roman Archaeology 9 (1996): pp. 539‚Äì42). See also: Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 9; Cascio, \\"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\\" (CAH), 179; Rees, Diocletian and the Tetrarchy, pp. 24‚Äì27. The early Christian author Lactantius ( 250 ‚Äì 325) claimed that Diocletian's reforms led to widespread economic stagnation, since \\"the provinces were divided into minute portions, and many presidents and a multitude of inferior officers lay heavy on each territory.\\" After the Empire split, the Byzantine Empire developed a notoriously complicated administrative hierarchy, and in the 20th century the term \\"Byzantine\\" came to refer to any complex bureaucratic structure.: \\"pertaining to Byzantium (q.v., original name of Constantinople, modern Istanbul), 1770, from Late Latin Byzantinus; originally used of the style of art and architecture developed there 4c.-5c. C.E.; later in reference to the complex, devious, and intriguing character of the royal court of Constantinople (1937).\\" In China, when the Qin dynasty (221‚Äì206 BC) unified China under the Legalist system, the emperor assigned administration to dedicated officials rather than nobility, ending feudalism in China, replacing it with a centralized, bureaucratic government. The form of government created by the first emperor and his advisors was used by later dynasties to structure their own government.World and Its Peoples: Eastern and Southern Asia, p. 36 Under this system, the government thrived, as talented individuals could be more easily identified in the transformed society. The Han dynasty (202 BC - 220 AD) established a complicated bureaucracy based on the teachings of Confucius, who emphasized the importance of ritual in a family, in relationships, and in politics. With each subsequent dynasty, the bureaucracy evolved. In 165 BC, Emperor Wen introduced the first method of recruitment to civil service through examinations, while Emperor Wu (r. 141‚Äì87 BC), cemented the ideology of Confucius into mainstream governance installed a system of recommendation and nomination in government service known as xiaolian, and a national academyMichael Loewe 1994 p..

Yet recruitment by recommendations to office was still prominent in both dynasties. It was not until the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279) that the recruitment of those who passed the exams and earned degrees was given greater emphasis and significantly expanded.Ebrey, Patricia Buckley, Anne Walthall, James Palais. (2006). East Asia: A Cultural, Social, and Political History. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company. . 145‚Äì146. During the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279) the bureaucracy became meritocratic. Following the Song reforms, competitive examinations took place to determine which candidates qualified to hold given positions. The imperial examination system lasted until 1905, six years before the Qing dynasty collapsed, marking the end of China's traditional bureaucratic system. =Modern=Ashanti Empire The government of the Ashanti Empire was built upon a sophisticated bureaucracy in Kumasi, with separate ministries which saw to the handling of state affairs. Ashanti's Foreign Office was based in Kumasi. Despite the small size of the office, it allowed the state to pursue complex negotiations with foreign powers. The Office was divided into departments that handled Ashanti relations separately with the British, French, Dutch, and Arabs. Scholars of Ashanti history, such as Larry Yarak and Ivor Wilkes, disagree over the power of this sophisticated bureaucracy in comparison to the Asantehene. However, both scholars agree that it was a sign of a highly developed government with a complex system of checks and balances. The United Kingdom Department of Excise developed a sophisticated bureaucracy. Pictured, the Custom House in the City of London Instead of the inefficient and often corrupt system of tax farming that prevailed in absolutist states such as France, the Exchequer was able to exert control over the entire system of tax revenue and government expenditure. By the late 18th century, the ratio of fiscal bureaucracy to population in Britain was approximately 1 in 1300, almost four times larger than the second most heavily bureaucratized nation, France. Thomas Taylor Meadows, Britain's consul in Guangzhou, argued in his Desultory Notes on the Government and People of China (1847) that \\"the long duration of the Chinese empire is solely and altogether owing to the good government which consists in the advancement of men of talent and merit only,\\" and that the British must reform their civil service by making the institution meritocratic. Influenced by the ancient Chinese imperial examination, the Northcote‚ÄìTrevelyan Report of 1854 recommended that recruitment should be on the basis of merit determined through competitive examination, candidates should have a solid general education to enable inter-departmental transfers, and promotion should be through achievement rather than \\"preferment, patronage, or purchase\\".Full text of the Northcote-Trevelyan Report This led to implementation of Her Majesty's Civil Service as a systematic, meritocratic civil service bureaucracy. In the British civil service, just as it was in China, entrance to the civil service was usually based on a general education in ancient classics, which similarly gave bureaucrats greater prestige. The Cambridge-Oxford ideal of the civil service was identical to the Confucian ideal of a general education in world affairs through humanism. (Well into the 20th century, Classics, Literature, History and Language remained heavily favoured in British civil service examinations. In the period of 1925‚Äì1935, 67 percent of British civil service entrants consisted of such graduates.) Like the Chinese model's consideration of personal values, the British model also took personal physique and character into account. France Like the British, the development of French bureaucracy was influenced by the Chinese system. Under Louis XIV of France, the old nobility had neither power nor political influence, their only privilege being exemption from taxes. The dissatisfied noblemen complained about this \\"unnatural\\" state of affairs, and discovered similarities between absolute monarchy and bureaucratic despotism. With the translation of Confucian texts during the Enlightenment, the concept of a meritocracy reached intellectuals in the West, who saw it as an alternative to the traditional ancien regime of Europe.Schwarz (1996), p. 229 Western perception of China even in the 18th century admired the Chinese bureaucratic system as favourable over European governments for its seeming meritocracy; Voltaire claimed that the Chinese had \\"perfected moral science\\" and Fran√ßois Quesnay advocated an economic and political system modeled after that of the Chinese.Schwarz (1996), p. 232 The governments of China, Egypt, Peru and Empress Catherine II were regarded as models of Enlightened Despotism, admired by such figures as Diderot, D'Alembert and Voltaire. Napoleonic France adopted this meritocracy system and soon saw a rapid and dramatic expansion of government, accompanied by the rise of the French civil service and its complex systems of bureaucracy. This phenomenon became known as \\"bureaumania\\". In the early 19th century, Napoleon attempted to reform the bureaucracies of France and other territories under his control by the imposition of the standardized Napoleonic Code. But paradoxically, that led to even further growth of the bureaucracy. French civil service examinations adopted in the late 19th century were also heavily based on general cultural studies. These features have been likened to the earlier Chinese model. Other industrialized nations By the mid-19th century, bureaucratic forms of administration were firmly in place across the industrialized world. Thinkers like John Stuart Mill and Karl Marx began to theorize about the economic functions and power-structures of bureaucracy in contemporary life. Max Weber was the first to endorse bureaucracy as a necessary feature of modernity, and by the late 19th century bureaucratic forms had begun their spread from government to other large-scale institutions. The trend toward increased bureaucratization continued in the 20th century, with the public sector employing over 5% of the workforce in many Western countries. Within capitalist systems, informal bureaucratic structures began to appear in the form of corporate power hierarchies, as detailed in mid-century works like The Organization Man and The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit. Meanwhile, in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc nations, a powerful class of bureaucratic administrators termed nomenklatura governed nearly all aspects of public life. The 1980s brought a backlash against perceptions of \\"big government\\" and the associated bureaucracy. Politicians like Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan gained power by promising to eliminate government regulatory bureaucracies, which they saw as overbearing, and return economic production to a more purely capitalistic mode, which they saw as more efficient. In the business world, managers like Jack Welch gained fortune and renown by eliminating bureaucratic structures inside corporations. Still, in the modern world, most organized institutions rely on bureaucratic systems to manage information, process records, and administer complex systems, although the decline of paperwork and the widespread use of electronic databases is transforming the way bureaucracies function. TheoriesKarl Marx= Karl Marx theorized about the role and function of bureaucracy in his Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right, published in 1843. In Philosophy of Right, Hegel had supported the role of specialized officials in public administration, although he never used the term \\"bureaucracy\\" himself. By contrast, Marx was opposed to bureaucracy. Marx posited that while corporate and government bureaucracy seem to operate in opposition, in actuality they mutually rely on one another to exist. He wrote that \\"The Corporation is civil society's attempt to become state; but the bureaucracy is the state which has really made itself into civil society.\\" =John Stuart Mill= Writing in the early 1860s, political scientist John Stuart Mill theorized that successful monarchies were essentially bureaucracies, and found evidence of their existence in Imperial China, the Russian Empire, and the regimes of Europe. Mill referred to bureaucracy as a distinct form of government, separate from representative democracy. He believed bureaucracies had certain advantages, most importantly the accumulation of experience in those who actually conduct the affairs. Nevertheless, he believed this form of governance compared poorly to representative government, as it relied on appointment rather than direct election. Mill wrote that ultimately the bureaucracy stifles the mind, and that \\"a bureaucracy always tends to become a pedantocracy.\\" =Max Weber= The German sociologist Max Weber was the first to formally study bureaucracy and his works led to the popularization of this term. In his essay Bureaucracy,,Weber, 2015, pp. 73‚Äì127 in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, edited and translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, New York: Palgrave MacMillan published in his magnum opus Economy and Society, Weber described many ideal-typical forms of public administration, government, and business. His ideal-typical bureaucracy, whether public or private, is characterized by: * hierarchical organization * formal lines of authority (chain of command) * a fixed area of activity * rigid division of labor * regular and continuous execution of assigned tasks * all decisions and powers specified and restricted by regulations * officials with expert training in their fields * career advancement dependent on technical qualifications * qualifications evaluated by organizational rules, not individualsWeber 2015, p. 76, in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society: New Translations on Politics, Bureaucracy, and Social Stratification, edited and translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters. New York: Palgrave Macmillan Weber listed several preconditions for the emergence of bureaucracy, including an increase in the amount of space and population being administered, an increase in the complexity of the administrative tasks being carried out, and the existence of a monetary economy requiring a more efficient administrative system. Development of communication and transportation technologies make more efficient administration possible, and democratization and rationalization of culture results in demands for equal treatment. Although he was not necessarily an admirer of bureaucracy, Weber saw bureaucratization as the most efficient and rational way of organizing human activity and therefore as the key to rational-legal authority, indispensable to the modern world.Max Weber (2015) extract, books.google.ca; accessed 30 August 2015. Furthermore, he saw it as the key process in the ongoing rationalization of Western society. Weber also saw bureaucracy, however, as a threat to individual freedoms, and the ongoing bureaucratization as leading to a \\"polar night of icy darkness\\", in which increasing rationalization of human life traps individuals in a soulless \\"iron cage\\" of bureaucratic, rule-based, rational control. Weber's critical study of the bureaucratization of society became one of the most enduring parts of his work. Many aspects of modern public administration are based on his work, and a classic, hierarchically organized civil service of the Continental type is called \\"Weberian civil service\\" or \\"Weberian bureaucracy\\". It is debated among social scientists whether Weberian bureaucracy contributes to economic growth. =Woodrow Wilson= Writing as an academic while a professor at Bryn Mawr College, Woodrow Wilson's essay The Study of AdministrationWoodrow Wilson, \\"The Study of Administration\\", Political Science Quarterly, July 1887 argued for bureaucracy as a professional cadre, devoid of allegiance to fleeting politics. Wilson advocated a bureaucracy that \\"is a part of political life only as the methods of the counting house are a part of the life of society; only as machinery is part of the manufactured product. But it is, at the same time, raised very far above the dull level of mere technical detail by the fact that through its greater principles it is directly connected with the lasting maxims of political wisdom, the permanent truths of political progress.\\" Wilson did not advocate a replacement of rule by the governed, he simply advised that, \\"Administrative questions are not political questions. Although politics sets the tasks for administration, it should not be suffered to manipulate its offices\\". This essay became a foundation for the study of public administration in America.Christopher Hood (30 March 2000). The Art of the State: Culture, Rhetoric, and Public Management. Oxford University Press. p. 76. . Retrieved 29 January 2019 =Ludwig von Mises= In his 1944 work Bureaucracy, the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises compared bureaucratic management to profit management. Profit management, he argued, is the most effective method of organization when the services rendered may be checked by economic calculation of profit and loss. When, however, the service in question can not be subjected to economic calculation, bureaucratic management is necessary. He did not oppose universally bureaucratic management; on the contrary, he argued that bureaucracy is an indispensable method for social organization, for it is the only method by which the law can be made supreme, and is the protector of the individual against despotic arbitrariness. Using the example of the Catholic Church, he pointed out that bureaucracy is only appropriate for an organization whose code of conduct is not subject to change. He then went on to argue that complaints about bureaucratization usually refer not to the criticism of the bureaucratic methods themselves, but to \\"the intrusion of bureaucracy into all spheres of human life.\\" Mises saw bureaucratic processes at work in both the private and public spheres; however, he believed that bureaucratization in the private sphere could only occur as a consequence of government interference. According to him, \\"What must be realized is only that the strait jacket of bureaucratic organization paralyzes the individual's initiative, while within the capitalist market society an innovator still has a chance to succeed. The former makes for stagnation and preservation of inveterate methods, the latter makes for progress and improvement.\\" =Robert K. Merton= American sociologist Robert K. Merton expanded on Weber's theories of bureaucracy in his work Social Theory and Social Structure, published in 1957. While Merton agreed with certain aspects of Weber's analysis, he also noted the dysfunctional aspects of bureaucracy, which he attributed to a \\"trained incapacity\\" resulting from \\"over conformity\\". He believed that bureaucrats are more likely to defend their own entrenched interests than to act to benefit the organization as a whole but that pride in their craft makes them resistant to changes in established routines. Merton stated that bureaucrats emphasize formality over interpersonal relationships, and have been trained to ignore the special circumstances of particular cases, causing them to come across as \\"arrogant\\" and \\"haughty\\". = Elliott Jaques = In his book \\"A General Theory of Bureaucracy\\", first published in 1976, Dr. Elliott Jaques describes the discovery of a universal and uniform underlying structure of managerial or work levels in the bureaucratic hierarchy for any type of employment systems. Elliott Jaques argues and presents evidence that for the bureaucracy to provide a valuable contribution to the open society some of the following conditions must be met: * Number of levels in a bureaucracy hierarchy must match the complexity level of the employment system for which the bureaucratic hierarchy is created (Elliott Jaques identified maximum 8 levels of complexity for bureaucratic hierarchies). * Roles within a bureaucratic hierarchy differ in the level of work complexity. * The level of work complexity in the roles must be matched with the level of human capability of the role holders (Elliott Jaques identified maximum 8 Levels of human capability). * The level of work complexity in any managerial role within a bureaucratic hierarchy must be one level higher than the level of work complexity of the subordinate roles. * Any managerial role in a bureaucratic hierarchy must have full managerial accountabilities and authorities (veto selection to the team, decide task types and specific task assignments, decide personal effectiveness and recognition, decide initiation of removal from the team within due process). * Lateral working accountabilities and authorities must be defined for all the roles in the hierarchy (7 types of lateral working accountabilities and authorities: collateral, advisory, service-getting and -giving, coordinative, monitoring, auditing, prescribing). The definition of effective bureaucratic hierarchy by Elliott Jaques is of importance not only to sociology but to social psychology, social anthropology, economics, politics, and social philosophy. They also have a practical application in business and administrative studies.

It was last assigned to the 412th Operations Group at Air Force Plant 42, Palmdale Regional Airport, California, where it was inactivated on 1 August 2008. The squadron's primary mission throughout its lifetime was flight and acceptance testing of the Lockheed F-117A Nighthawk stealth fighter and the Rockwell B-1B Lancer bomber. Activated in March 1989 for B-1B flight testing, the mission of the unit was changed in 1993 when B-1 testing transferred to the 419th Flight Test Squadron and the squadron became the F-117A test squadron, assuming the mission originated in 1980 at Groom Lake, Nevada. HistoryB-1B Lancer testing=Background In November 1979, the Air Force began a study for a modified version of an existing airframe to carry air launched cruise missiles, called the Long-Range Combat Aircraft (LRCA). On 2 October 1981, President Ronald Reagan announced a Strategic Modernization Program, which would include the procurement of 100 (LRCA). The Rockwell International proposal for the LRCA was a modified B-1A, which was designated the B-1B Lancer. The first B-1B incorporated several sub- assemblies of the No. 5 B-1A, which has been under construction when the B-1A program was cancelled. Rockwell test pilots flew it for the first time on 31 October 1984, from the Rockwell International assembly plant at Air Force Plant 42, Palmdale, California, landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California. The B-1B was ready for delivery to Strategic Air Command barely eight months after its first flight. 6510 Test Squadron When the aircraft reached operational squadrons, many shortcomings were discovered. Air Force Systems Command formed the 6510th Test Squadron in March 1989 to test these modifications. Modifications included those needed to improve the low-altitude range of the aircraft, which it was well short of its proposed maximum unrefueled range of 7,455 miles. The modifications increased the range of the aircraft from 1,300 nautical miles to over 3,000. Other modifications tested were to correct problems with the terrain-following radar system, defensive avionics systems, fuel leaks and the Lancer's central integrated test system. In December 1990 General Electric F101 engine turbofan blade failures caused the grounding of the B-1B aircraft, requiring additional modifications. The B-1 test mission transferred to 6519th Test Squadron on 1 July 1991 and the squadron ceased operations, however it remained active.Rogers, =F-117A Nighthawk testing=Background In November 1978, the preliminary testing of the Have Blue stealth aircraft was successfully completed, and during November 1978, Lockheed Corporation was awarded a contract to begin full-scale development of the project. The program was given the code name Senior Trend. In 1980, the Senior Trend Joint (later Combined) Test Force was established at Area 51 consisting of a combination of Lockheed and USAF personnel as an acceptance test unit for newly manufactured aircraft. Air Force Systems Command personnel participating in the test were assigned to Air Force Flight Test Center, Detachment 3.F-117 Serial Number Search In June 1981, the first Senior Trend test aircraft was delivered for testing and on 18 June 1981 the first successful flight was made by a Lockheed test pilot. There were usually four to six test flights (about half contractor and half USAF) for acceptance. They included systems checks, handling qualities evaluations, and low observable radar verifications. All flights of the aircraft were made at night without lights and the runway was only briefly illuminated to facilitate landings and takeoffs. The first production aircraft, 80-10785 was ready for its first flight on 20 April 1982. However, unknown to anyone, the fly-by-wire system had been hooked up incorrectly (pitch was yaw and vice versa). Upon liftoff, the plane immediately went out of control. Instead of the nose pitching up, it went horizontal. The aircraft went inverted and ended up traveling backwards through the air. The pilot had no time to eject, and the aircraft flew into the ground. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair, but some of its parts could be salvaged. On 10 November 1988, the long-rumored existence of the \\"F-117 Stealth Fighter\\" was finally officially confirmed by the Pentagon. In 1990 the last F-117A was delivered. and the flight test squadron no longer had to perform acceptance flights at Groom Lake. However, the flight test duties still included flights for refurbished aircraft received from Lockheed. In February and March 1992 the F-117 test unit moved from Groom Lake to Palmdale Plant 42 where Lockheed had produced the aircraft, although some testing, especially RCS verification and other classified activity, was still conducted at Groom Lake. At Palmdale, the test unit came under the operational control of the 2874th Test Squadron (later the 337th Test Squadron) of the 412th Test Wing at Edwards as Detachment 5 of the 337th Squadron. 410th Test Squadron 410th Flight Test Squadron F-117A NighthawkAircraft is Lockheed F-117A Nighthawk, serial 79-10783. This plane will be stored in Hangar 1210 at Edwards Air Force Base while it is refurbished for display at the Air Force Flight Test Center Museum. In February 1993, the wing's Director of Operations proposed that the unit be established as the 410th Test Squadron. Headquarters AFMC agreed to this, Detachment 5 was discontinued and its personnel and equipment assigned to the 410th Test Squadron (the new name of the 6510th) on 1 March 1993 and the squadron resumed operations. Flight testing continued at Palmdale throughout the operational life of the F-117. On 1 August 2008, with the retirement of the F-117 from the inventory, the last aircraft of the 410th was flown to Tonopah TRA for permanent storage and the unit was inactivated.

He was prosecuted for sedition in the late 1840s for publishing a small article entitled 'Der konstituierte Despotismus und die konstitutionelle Freiheit' (1849) and was subsequently forced to leave Germany. He then emigrated to the German pioneer settlements of central Texas where he worked as a farmer, geographer and inventor. He was one of the early German Free Thinkers in Sisterdale, Texas. Texas State Historical Association In 1853, he was elected Texas State Historical Association the President of the Freethinker abolitionist organization Die Freie Verein (The Free Society), which called for a meeting of abolitionist German Texans Texas State Historical Association in conjunction with 14 May 1854 Staats-Saengerfest (State Singing Festival) in San Antonio, Texas. The convention adopted a political, social and religious platform, The Texas State Historical Association including: > 1) Equal pay for equal work; 2) Direct election of the President of the > United States; 3) Abolition of capital punishment; 4) Slavery is an evil, > the abolition of which is a requirement of democratic principles...; 5) Free > schools ‚Äì including universities - supported by the state, without religious > influence; and 6) Total separation of church and state. After the Civil War he left the USA for a visit to Germany, but fell ill during the voyage. Urged by his physician not to risk the return trip at his age, he re-entered the academic world. Reflecting on his frontier experience, Kapp wrote \\"Grundlinien einer Philosophie der Technik\\" (Elements of a Philosophy of Technology) (1877). This work, among many other things, formulates a philosophy of technology in which tools and weapons are identified as different forms of 'organ projections', although this idea may have been loosely covered as early as Aristotle. Furthermore, in chapters 12 & 13, it notably analyses language and the state as extensions of mental life, long before such ideas were popularised by Marshall McLuhan.

Their marriage lasted 11 years until his death, during which time he created over 400 portraits of her, more than any of Picasso's other loves.Hohenadel (2004). Early life Born in 1927 in Paris, France, she was only two when her father abandoned her mother and her five -year-old brother. Jacqueline never forgave him. Her mother raised her in cramped concierge's quarters near the Champs Elys√©es, while also working long hours as a seamstress. Jacqueline was 18 when her mother died of a stroke. In 1946, Jacqueline married Andr√© Hutin, an engineer, with whom she had a daughter, Catherine Hutin-Blay. The young family moved to Africa, where Hutin worked, but four years later Jacqueline returned to France and divorced Hutin. She settled down on the French Riviera and took a job at her cousin's shop, the Madoura Pottery in Vallauris. Picasso Pablo Picasso met Jacqueline in 1953 at the Madoura Pottery when she was 26 years old and he was 72. He romanced her by drawing a dove on her house in chalk and bringing her one rose a day until she agreed to date him six months later. They married in Vallauris on 2 March 1961. Roque's image began to appear in Picasso's paintings in May 1954. These portraits are characterized by an exaggerated neck and feline face, distortions of Roque's features. Eventually her dark eyes and eyebrows, high cheekbones, and classical profile would become familiar symbols in his late paintings.Johns (2001), p. 461. It is likely that Picasso's series of paintings derived from Eug√®ne Delacroix's The Women of Algiers was inspired by Roque's beauty; the artist commented that \\"Delacroix had already met Jacqueline.\\" In 1955 he drew Jacqueline as \\"Lola de Valence\\", a reference to √âdouard Manet's painting of the Spanish dancer.Johns (2001), p. 462. In 1963 he painted her portrait 160 times, and continued to paint her, in increasingly abstracted forms, until 1972. Later life After Pablo's death in 1973, Jacqueline prevented Picasso's children Claude and Paloma Picasso from attending his funeral.Zabel, William D. (1996). The Rich Die Richer and You Can too. New York: John Wiley and Sons. p.11. . Accessed online 2007-08-15. Jacqueline also barred Picasso's grandson Pablito Picasso, (son of Paolo, Picasso's son from his marriage to the Russian dancer Olga Koklova), from attending the service. Pablito was so distraught he drank bleach and died three months later.

After the legal battles and death of Picasso's son Paolo, a French court ruled that the inheritors to the Picasso estate were Jacqueline, his children and grandchildren: Claude, Paloma, Maya, Bernard and Marina Picasso. Eventually Claude, Paloma and Jacqueline agreed to establish the Mus√©e Picasso in Paris. Jacqueline Picasso shot herself in 1986 when she was 59 years old. Shortly before her death she had confirmed that she would be present at an upcoming exhibit of her private collection of Picasso's work in Spain. NotesReferences * DuPont, Pepita (2007).

He was previously the Vice President of the Bougainville People's Congress. Early life Tanis was raised in Panam Village in Lamane, on the border of South and Central Bougainville. The Bougainville independence movement began in the 1980s after local landowners closed the Panguna copper mine. In 1989, Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) leaders proclaimed Bougainville independent from Papua New Guinea and established an interim government. A civil war consumed the island for the next decade as the BRA fought the Papua New Guinea military. Tanis is a former guerrilla and commander in the BRA. Tanis has been described as having been \\"once closely linked with the late separatist leader, Francis Ona.\\" He later became \\"a key player in forging the 2001 peace agreement\\" following the Bougainvillean civil war. However, Bougainville has been plagued by infighting and tensions from years of conflict. Presidency Tanis' predecessor, John Tabinaman, took over as Acting President after Joseph Kabui died in office of a heart attack in June 2008. This led to a special presidential election in November and December 2008.\\"Funeral for Bougainville leader\\", BBC News, 10 June 2008. There were 14 candidates; Tanis was declared winner with a margin of 13,547 votes over second-runner Sam Akoitai.\\"New Bougainville president promises unity\\", ABC Radio Australia, 29 December 2008 The election had a poor voter turnout which was reportedly contributed to by heavily armed road blocks, ongoing local disputes, and complaints by many Bougainvilleans that their names were not on election rolls. Tanis was sworn in on 6 January 2009. Experts have said that the election of the 43-year-old Tanis \\"represents a generational change\\" in Bougainville's political leadership. Tanis was inaugurated as Bougainville's second elected president in a colorful swearing- in ceremony on 6 January 2009, as Bougainvilleans in traditional costumes travelled from all corners of the island to attend the ceremony in Arawa, Central Bougainville.\\"Bougainville President elect prepares for swearing in ceremony\\", ABC Radio Australia, 2 January 2009 The ceremony lasted most of the day and included indigenous music and dance. Before the inauguration, Tanis undertook a trip through some twenty fast flowing rivers and creeks before arriving safely in Arawa for the ceremony. Tanis served an interim term, completing Kabui's scheduled term before the presidential election of 2010. He said his focus would be on promoting unity in the aftermath of the long civil war. Tanis said he is \\"not looking at achieving much\\" during his 20-month term in office, but will ensure peace prevails through reconciliation. Tanis appointed Ezekiel Massat as Vice President on 19 January 2009. He was defeated by John Momis in 2010. Post-presidency Since 2014 Tanis has been Secretary for Peace in the Bougainville Administration. In 2018 he resigned, but two days later retracted his resignation saying he had resolved his differences with President John Momis. In late 2018 Tanis was suspended on allegations of misconduct. In March 2019 Tanis was dismissed from office, having been found guilty by an independent Board of Inquiry of gross misconduct. Despite this, Tanis is quoted by media as saying he had already been appointed aa a special envoy of President John Momis on Peace. This is despite Momis being Chairman of the same Committee that dismissed Tanis from office. Tanis remains a controversial figure in Bougainville politics and is widely tipped to run for election as president in 2020 when current President John Momis must stand down.

It is situated in Gopeshwar village now part of Gopeshwar town. The temple stands out in its architectural proficiency; it is topped by a magnificent dome and the sanctum sanctorum, which is aessible by 24 doors. The remains of broken idols found around the temple testify the existence of several more temples in ancient times. There is a trident, in the courtyard of the temple, about 5 m high, made of eight different metals, which dates back to the 12th century. It boasts the inscriptions attributed to Anekmalla, the king of Nepal who reigned in the 13th century. Four short inscriptions written in Devanagri, which dates back to a later period, are yet to be deciphered, barring one. Legend is that the trident got fixed in this spot, when Lord Shiva threw it at Lord Kama to kill him. The metal of the trident is not weathered by the elements and this is a wonder. The legend goes that the trident belonged to Shiva who threw it at Kamdeva (The God Of Love) to kill him and it got fixed in this spot. It is believed that while brute force can not move this Trident, the slightest touch by a true devotee can cause a tremor in it. The metal of the trident does not appear to have become weathered by the elements over the century.

It consists of heuristics for developing arguments, which are in the first place plausible rather than rigorous, from commonplaces (topoi or loci). In other words, therefore, it consists of standardized ways of thinking up debating techniques from existing, thought-through positions. The actual practice of topical argument was much developed by Roman lawyers.http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/boethius/http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic- ancient/ Cicero took the theory of Aristotle to be an aspect of rhetoric.A. A. Long, From Epicurus to Epictetus: Studies in Hellenistic and Roman Philosophy (2006), p. 302. As such it belongs to inventio in the classic fivefold division of rhetoric. The standard classical work on topical logic was the De Topicis Differentiis (On Topical Differentiae) by Boethius. Differentiae refer to case analysis, being the differentiations used to distinguish the cases into which a question is divided. Besides Aristotle and Cicero, Boethius built on Themistius.George Alexander Kennedy, Classical Rhetoric & Its Christian & Secular Tradition from Ancient to Modern Times (1999), p. 202. In terminology, the Greek axioma and topos in Boethius became the Latin maxima propositio (maxim, universal truth) and locus. In the Middle Ages topical logic became a theory of inference, for which the name \\"axiomatic topics\\" has been suggested.Norman Kretzmann, Anthony Kenny, Jan Pinborg, The Cambridge History of Later Medieval Philosophy: From the Rediscovery of Aristotle to the Disintegration of Scholasticism, 1100-1600 (1988), pp. 111-2. Abelard wanted to complete a theory of entailment by invoking the loci in Boethius to fill in conditionals, a flawed if bold development.http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abelard/Christopher J. Martin, Logic, pp. 172-3 in Jeffrey E. Brower, Kevin Guilfoy (editors), The Cambridge Companion to Abelard (2004). Peter of Spain, in his De locis, developed the ideas of Boethius.http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/peter-spain/ The De inventione dialectica of Rodolphus Agricola (1479) made large claims for this method, as an aspect of dialectic (traditionally contrasted with rhetoric) subordinated to inventio.Thomas M. Conley, Rhetoric in the European Tradition (1994), pp. 125-6. The precise relationship of \\"dialectic\\" and \\"rhetoric\\" remained vexed well into the sixteenth century, hinging on the role assigned to loci. It was expounded in different fashions by Philipp Melanchthon and Petrus Ramus.Harold J. Berman, Law and Revolution, II: The Impact of the Protestant Reformations on the Western Legal Tradition (2006), p. 112. The debate fed into the later development of Ramism.

Early years Mick Brophy was born on 9 October 1932 in Danesfort, County Kilkenny. His parents Thomas and Elizabeth, farmed a dairy farm in the parish which is located 5 miles from the city of Kilkenny. Up to the introduction of the parish rule, Brophy played his underage hurling with Eoghan Ruadh (Callan). He later played with his local club Danesfort, and was a member of the Kilkenny senior inter-county team in the 1950s. Career He played at midfield in the famous 1957 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final, when Kilkenny beat their neighbours and great rivals, Waterford by a single point. The 1957 victory was greeted with jubilant celebration in the Marble city; the first for Kilkenny in ten years, since the famous win over Cork in the 1947 final. A special effort had been made at the time to trawl for talent amongst Junior clubs to try to reverse Kilkenny 's ailing fortunes. It proved to be successful and Kilkenny have never since waited ten years to capture All Ireland glory. The same teams, Kilkenny and Waterford, would again meet in the 1959 final when, after a draw, fortunes were reversed in the replay with a Waterford victory. This remains Waterford's last title and Mick attended the recent All Ireland final of 2008, some 49 years later, when Kilkenny overcame Waterford with relative ease to capture the first 'three in a row' since the Cork team of the seventies. Brophy had played with the Kilkenny minor teams in 1949 and 1950 capturing the All Ireland title in 1950. For many years Mick Brophy was the only Danesfort man to hold a senior All Ireland hurling medal. Presently there are two Danesfort players featuring on the Kilkenny senior team - namely Ritchie Hogan and Paul Murphy. Legacy Renowned as a skilful left handed midfielder Brophy was especially noted for his ability to double on the ball in the air; a skill which has been largely lost from the modern game. Mick Brophy died in spring 2009 and is fondly remembered by the older contingent of Kilkenny hurling followers.

It opened in 1878 as part of the Buckinghamshire Railway's branch line to Verney Junction which provided connections to Banbury, and and closed in 1964. History The Buckinghamshire Railway's line from Banbury to Verney Junction opened to passengers on 1 May 1850. It had been originally planned to provide a station to serve the Buckinghamshire village of Padbury at a projected cost of ¬£3,000 () but this did not materialise, possibly as a result of necessary economies. It was not until 1 March 1878 that a station was opened at Padbury. The London and North Western Railway, which had worked the line from its opening and which absorbed the Buckinghamshire Railway in 1879, advised the Board of Trade in January 1878 that a station was being built at Padbury and that a siding had been laid to facilitate construction. The points to the siding were locked and an Annett's key was held by the stationmaster from whom it had to be collected and returned after each working to the siding. A 1911 Railway Clearing House map of railways in the vicinity of Padbury A simple single storey red brick station building with a gable roof was provided at Padbury. No provision was made for the stationmaster who was expected to live in one of the nearby houses, as was the case for the 's stationmaster. As with Farthinghoe railway station, the station had a single platform, long, but unlike Farthinghoe it was conveniently situated to the west of the village of 650 inhabitants that it served. The station's siding ran in to the station forecourt to a point adjacent to the main station building; nearby were a cattle landing, weighbridge and hut. The siding, which was controlled by a six-lever ground frame and was released by an electric token, accommodated four or five coal wagons a week, together with milk traffic for the United Dairies factory in Buckingham and the village's requirements. Padbury ceased to have its own stationmaster in 1928 upon the retirement of Levi Ambler. The station then came under the control of the stationmaster at Buckingham railway station who gave instructions to the remaining staff consisting of a single porter and junior assistant. From 1942 the station's staff consisted of a single lady porter, Bertha Allen, who was employed by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) as temporary wartime cover, but instead remained for a further twenty-four years until the station's closure. In 1960, the section of the line between Banbury and Buckingham was closed, with the remaining section lasting four more years. Padbury station was listed for closure by the Beeching report and it duly closed to goods traffic on 6 January 1964 and to passenger traffic on 7 September 1964. The track was however not removed immediately and Padbury was thus able to accommodate the Royal Train for an overnight stay on 3/4 April 1966 for a visit by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh to Buckingham. Bertha Allen, station mistress at Padbury Railway Station from 1942 until the station closed in 1966 Present day The station buildings were demolished in 1968 and the site was cleared. By 1975, construction of a small housing estate had commenced which now occupies the site. Just south of Padbury station a skew bridge took the line over Main Street which led into the village; no trace of this bridge remains. The course of the line to the south of the station followed a shallow cutting which is now infilled and returned to agriculture.

It conducted the Advanced Tactical Fighter program flyoff competition between the Lockheed YF-22 and Northrop YF-23 prototypes. Following the completion of the competition, the squadron has conducted testing of the F-22. History The YF-22 and YF-23 in formation during flight testing in the early 1990s The squadron was first activated as the 6511th Test Squadron in March 1989 to conduct the Advanced Tactical Fighter program. It began flying the Northrop YF-23 on 27 August and the Lockheed YF-22 on 29 September 1990, flying both through December 1990, though the airplanes were assigned to the manufacturers rather than to USAF. The YF-22 (and the Pratt & Whitney F119 engine) was declared the winner of the competition on 23 April 1991, and on 2 August 1991 both YF-22 prototypes were transferred to the Air Force.Rogers, Though the Number 1 YF-22 returned to the Lockheed Corporation plant to become a ground test bed for production designs, the Number 2 aircraft flew with the 6511th until 25 April 1992, when it was extensively damaged in a landing mishap. The 6511th (redesignated the 411th Test Squadron in October 1992) then spent the next few years planning for the F-22 test program, and received the first Lockheed Martin F-22A Raptor in February 1998. Edwards flight testing was completed in December 2004 and the 27th Fighter Squadron at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia was the first squadron to transition to the Raptor, receiving the first operational aircraft 18 January 2005 from Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, where the 43d Fighter Squadron trained Raptor pilots. On 25 March 2009 an F-22 operated by a squadron pilot, David P. Cooley, crashed 35 miles northeast of Edwards during a training flight. The squadron successfully tested the F-22 flying on a 50/50 fuel blend of conventional petroleum-based JP-8 and biofuel derived from camelina, a weed-like plant not used for food, in March 2011. The overall test objective was to evaluate biofuel fuel blend suitability in the F-22. Testing consisted of air starts, operability, and performance at different speeds and altitudes throughout the flight envelope. The F-22 Raptor performed several maneuvers including a supercruiseSupercruise is supersonic flight without using the engine's afterburner. at 40,000 ft. reaching speeds of Mach 1.5.

Early history  Chapman was born on July 16, 1945 in San Mateo, California and grew up in San Francisco, California. An organ prodigy, he began formal study at age 5 with S. Leslie Grow, a student of Marcel Dupr√©. Chapman was the accompanist to the Capuchino High School Concert Choir while it was directed by Otto Mielenz. Having studied with Richard Purvis, the organist at the time of Grace Cathedral, San Francisco, Chapman eventually took up post there as Assistant Organist. Chapman came to Philadelphia where he attended the Curtis Institute of Music from 1964 to 1968, studying organ under Alexander McCurdy who had also been Purvis's teacher. Chapman received a master's degree from Temple University in 1971 and an honorary doctor of musical arts degree from Combs College of Music in Philadelphia in 1978. He also had several original compositions published for organ solo. In addition to his appointment at Wanamaker's, Chapman performed with the Philadelphia Orchestra and served as organist and choirmaster at Philadelphia's First Presbyterian Church, Wayne United Methodist Church in suburban Philadelphia, and Reform Congregation Keneseth Israel.  Association with Wanamaker  Chapman was appointed principal organist at Wanamaker's in 1966 at age 20 while he was still a student at Curtis. He would preside over the largest fully playable organ in the world, and would remain at that position for the next 23 years until his untimely death in 1989. At the time of Chapman's appointment, the Wanamaker Organ had been underused. As one of his first projects, Chapman arranged for the broadcast of Wanamaker concerts which were heard over Philadelphia radio station WHYY-FM and included his own commentaries about the performances and the organ. Chapman regularly welcomed visitors into the loft containing the organ console and permitted them to sit during performances. He also allowed visitors to be photographed with him on the organ bench. In addition to several known instances of Chapman playing practical jokes on customers at the store, he was also known for multitasking while performing by playing chess, reading newspaper stories aloud, or bantering with listeners in the loft. =Compositions= Keith Chapman published a number of pieces, most of which are arrangements of hymns or well- known melodies set in his personal style. They emphasize accent and rhythm for the faster pieces and harmonic variation in all of them, reminiscent of Debussy and Ravel. It is thought likely that many of these works began as improvisations from his daily work at Wanamaker's, where standard numbers, particularly Christmas selections, could be explored through experiment in the daily repetition. Chapman was a practical composer who sought to captivate appreciative audiences and achieve commercial success, while supplying the polished detail and variation that serious musicians would appreciate. Some pieces, such as an improvisation on \\"We Gather Together\\" or an arrangement of \\"Ding Dong Merrily on High\\" made reference to other compositions (\\"All Creatures of Our God and King\\" and \\"In Dir ist Freude\\", respectively here). His \\"Fanfare and Procession\\" is thought to be a totally original work. He tended to play some of his faster, livelier pieces slightly ahead of the beat, with rhythm invariably being a strong factor. He championed the beauty of the symphonic sound of the pipe organ during an era when it was aggressively criticized by the \\"musically correct\\" of the period. Chapman said that an unfulfilled ambition was to be an orchestra conductor. Rights to much of his music are held by Sony Corporation, and attempts at re-publication have not yet (2017) met with success, although performance rights have been granted. =Recordings= At the time of Chapman's death, it was thought that all copies of his historic broadcasts had been destroyed. Eventually it was discovered that two enthusiasts of the Wanamaker Organ had reproduced digitally remastered recordings of these radio broadcasts of very high quality. The Friends of the Wanamaker Organ organization was able to reissue on compact disk three of the half-hour performances. These recordings are of special significance because, shortly after Chapman's death, both the Echo and Ethereal divisions of the organ were damaged in separate accidents and became unplayable for many years. Other recordings include: * The Grand Court Organ (1973) * Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition (1975) * Airs & Arabesques (1976) * Chapman/Wanamaker - The Memorial Release - Vantage VCD 6304 * The Complete Chapman/Wanamaker Recordings - Vantage V2CD 69-694-001 * Keith Chapman - The \\"Lost Radio Broadcasts\\" - Vantage V2CD-698-002 * Keith Chapman - The \\"Lost Radio Broadcasts, Vol. 2\\" - Vantage WanaRadio2 * Keith Chapman - \\"Karg-Elert Instrumental Works\\" - Motette CD60351 * Keith Chapman - \\"The Wanamaker Store Organ\\", Karg-Elert, Jongen, Alain, Langlais, Daquin... - PCD60351 After his death, many of Chapman's arrangements were published in =Diamond Anniversary Concert= In 1986, Chapman was featured artist for the landmark concert at the Wanamaker Grand Court that celebrated his 20th anniversary as Wanamaker Organist and the Organ's 75th anniversary. Sponsored by the Wayne Concert Series, this was the first after-hours public organ concert at Wanamaker's in some 50 years. The tradition has been continued into the present day, largely under the auspices of the non-profit organization, The Friends of the Wanamaker Organ. The 1986 concert was recorded, and has been released on DVD by the Friends of the Wanamaker Organ. Also included is a 2009 update on the restoration of the instrument. Death Chapman and his wife, Sally, were killed when their twin-engine Cessna 310 crashed into the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of the Colorado Rockies while they were returning from a performance in California. The Chapmans were reportedly en route to visit Sally's daughter (from a previous marriage) and new grandchild in Omaha, Nebraska at the time of the crash. Chapman was succeeded at Wanamaker's later that year by Peter Richard Conte.

He was a close associate of Emperor Dezong and was in charge of financial matters. He drew severe criticism from traditional historical accounts for his frivolousness, fiscal irresponsibility, and attacks against other officials.  Background  Pei Yanling was born in 728, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His family was from Hezhong Municipality (Ê≤≥‰∏≠, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi).New Book of Tang, vol. 167 . His father Pei Xu (Ë£¥Êó≠) served as a prefectural prefect. Toward the end of the Qianyuan era (758-760) of Emperor Xuanzong's son Emperor Suzong, Pei Yanling was serving as the sheriff of Sishui County (Ê±úÊ∞¥, in modern Luoyang, Henan), when the nearby eastern capital Luoyang was captured by the rebel Yan army. Pei fled to E Prefecture (ÈÑÇÂ∑û, in modern Ezhou, Hubei). During his time there, he edited the commentaries that Pei Yin (Ë£¥Èß∞) wrote for the Records of the Grand Historian, and referred to himself as \\"Little Pei\\" in his remarks.Old Book of Tang, vol. 135 .  During Emperor Dezong's reign  Prior to becoming director of finances = When Dong Jin was serving as the prefect of Hua Prefecture (ËèØÂ∑û, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), he invited Pei Yanling to serve as his assistant in his role as defender of Tong Pass. Later, when a regional surveyor recommended Pei for his abilities, Pei was recalled to the capital Chang'an to serve as Taichang Boshi (Â§™Â∏∏ÂçöÂ£´), a scholar at the ministry of worship (Â§™Â∏∏ÂØ∫, Taichang Si). When Lu Qi was chancellor, Pei was promoted to be Shanbu Yuanwailang (ËÜ≥ÈÉ®Âì°Â§ñÈÉé), a low-level official at the ministry of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®, Libu) and an imperial scholar at Jixian Institute (ÈõÜË≥¢Èô¢); he later became Cibu Langzhong (Á•†ÈÉ®ÈÉé‰∏≠), a supervisorial official at the ministry of rites. While Cui Zao was chancellor, Cui was in charge of the finances, and he sent Pei to Luoyang to be in charge of the financial matters at the Luoyang branch government. After Han Huang took over the financial matters, Pei was recalled to Chang'an to resume his duties as Cibu Langzhong and imperial scholar. Once Pei arrived at Chang'an, however, he did not wait for imperial orders to clarify his responsibilities and directly headed for Jixian Institute to resume his duties there. This displeased the chancellor Zhang Yanshang, and Zhang had him demoted to be the magistrate of Zhaoying County (Êò≠Êáâ, near Chang'an). While he was serving there, there was an occasion when he had a disagreement with the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (‰∫¨ÂÖÜ, i.e., the Chang'an region), Zheng Shuze (ÈÑ≠ÂèîÂâá), and he submitted a petition attacking Zheng. The chancellor Li Mi favored Zheng, but the deputy chief imperial censor Dou Can, who was jealous of Li and protective of Pei, sided with Pei in the dispute. As a result, Zheng was demoted to be a prefectural prefect, while Pei was recalled to serve as Zhuzuolang (Ëëó‰ΩúÈÉé), an imperial librarian. When Dou subsequently became chancellor, he made Pei the deputy minister of imperial supplies (Â§™Â∫úÂ∞ëÂçø, Taifu Shaoqing) and later the deputy minister of agriculture (Âè∏Ëæ≤Â∞ëÂçø, Sinong Shaoqing). = As director of finances = In 792, Ban Hong (Áè≠ÂÆè) the director of finances died. The chancellor Lu Zhi recommended Li Sun (ÊùéÂ∑Ω) as Ban's replacement, and Emperor Dezong initially agreed. However, he soon changed his mind and wanted to replace Ban with Pei Yanling; he made Pei the deputy minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Hubu Shilang) and the director of finances. Lu submitted a petition severely criticizing Pei for frivolousness and lack of judgment, but Emperor Dezong did not take heed.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 234. As Pei was not himself familiar with financial matters, he summoned experienced administrators at the directorate of finances and asked them for suggestions on how to please the emperor. In 793, he came up with a scheme ‚Äî to change, on the books, uncollectible tax debts from the various prefectures into collectible ones, and moving the tax revenues that were actually submitted into a new separate storage. In all, no actual revenues were created, but Emperor Dezong was fooled into believing that Pei could increase the wealth of the state and therefore favored him more. Pei also falsely claimed that there was a large meadow to the west of Chang'an that could be used for raising horses ‚Äî which turned out to be nonexistent when Emperor Dezong sent investigators to consider it for that purpose, but Emperor Dezong did not punish him, despite criticism by other officials. Also at Pei's suggestion, Emperor Dezong left many officials' positions unfilled in order to save money, notwithstanding the necessity for those positions to be filled. Pei further suggested that the money used on imperial temples be diverted to Emperor Dezong's own palace, and also falsely claimed that he had access to giant trees for the building of a temple that Emperor Dezong commissioned, Shenlong Temple (Á•ûÈæçÂØ∫) ‚Äî such that when Emperor Dezong pointed out that those giants trees were not even available during the prosperous reign of Emperor Xuanzong, he responded that Emperor Xuanzong's reign was not impressive enough for those trees to reveal themselves. It was said that Emperor Dezong actually did realize that Pei was frivolous and often spoke untruths, but that he was happy to hear Pei gossip about other officials, and therefore continued to favor Pei.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 235. It was said that only several officials whose responsibilities were directly related to Pei's ‚Äî Zhang Pang (ÂºµÊªÇ) the director of the salt and iron monopolies, Li Chong (ÊùéÂÖÖ) the mayor of Jingzhao, and Li Xian (ÊùéÈäõ) the minister of agriculture ‚Äî dared to speak out against him, in addition to Lu, who repeatedly submitted petitions attacking Pei. However, Emperor Dezong's trust in Pei was not shaken, and instead, he began to be disaffected from Lu, whose opinion he had deeply valued previously. Lu's criticism of Pei was further neutralized when his chancellor colleague Zhao Jing began to leak Lu's criticism to Pei, such that Pei was able to anticipate it and deflect it. Around the new year 796, Lu was removed from his chancellor position, and thereafter Pei began to strike back, accusing Zhang, Li Chong, and Li Xian of being Lu's partisans, spreading rumors to cause soldiers to resent Emperor Dezong and Pei and to encourage them to mutiny. When an imperial guard soldier complained to Emperor Dezong that his corps was being inadequately supplied, Emperor Dezong came to believe that Pei was telling the truth about Lu and the others. In spring 796, he exiled Lu, Zhang, Li Chong, and Li Xian, to distant prefectures to be prefectural officials. In the aftermaths of these officials' exile, a number of low-level officials in charge of submitting suggestions to the emperor, led by Yang Cheng (ÈôΩÂüé), submitted petitions attacking Pei and defending Lu and the others, but the petitions fell on deaf ears. However, despite expectations at the time that Pei would soon be made chancellor, Pei was never made chancellor. Still, Pei was promoted to be the minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Hubu Shangshu). It was said, though, that Pei was confident that he would become chancellor, and he was abusive in his language toward other officials. Further, when he subsequently grew ill, he was freely delivering items from the imperial treasury to his own home, but no one dared to speak against him. Pei died in fall 796, and it was said that no official mourned him, and many people actually celebrated, but Emperor Dezong mourned deeply and posthumously honored him. During the reign of Emperor Dezong's grandson Emperor Xianzong, Pei was given the posthumous name Miao (ÁπÜ, meaning \\"untrue\\"). The Later Jin historian Liu Xu, the lead editor of the Old Book of Tang, commented thus about Pei and another official during the reign of Emperor Xianzong, Huangfu Bo: NotesReferences * Old Book of Tang, vol. 135. * New Book of Tang, vol. 167. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 234, 235.

Views  Although the high mass of Kinder Scout blocks views to the north, Grindslow Knoll is an excellent viewpoint stretching over a large portion of the southern Peak District and steep slopes to the Vale of Edale give a great sense of height. There are views of the Nab to the east.  Ascent  It is most often climbed from Edale, either via a steep and heavily eroded path that climbs 350m in just under a mile, or via the popular Grindsbrook Clough. The summit is also an easy detour from the path along the southern edges of Kinder Scout.  Walking  The Pennine Way crosses the hill's southern slopes shortly after leaving Edale, climbing to Broadlee Bank Tor before dropping to Upper Booth. This is the start of a very popular walk taking in Jacob's Ladder, Edale Cross, the Woolpacks and either Grindsbrook Clough or Grindslow Knoll.

Life Aptowitzer was born in Ternopil (Galicia) on March 16, 1871 to his parents Moshe Aaron and Tziril Kasner. His father, who suffered from poor health, was the head of a small yeshiva and barely eked out a living. Avigdor helped out from the age of seven by tutoring students. The family was aligned with the Chortikov hassidic dynasty; they also occasionally traveled to see the Rebbe (holy rabbi) of Husiaten. While staying in Husiaten Avigdor came under the influence of a local maskil. He began learning science and gradually ceased to pay visits to the Rebbe of Husiaten. As a result, the Rebbe's disciples asked that he be drafted in the Army, and he indeed served in the Army. In 1896 Aptowitzer traveled to Chernowitz where he studied for his matriculation exam, which he passed. He made a living by teaching mathematics. In 1899 he received rabbinical ordination and became engaged to Malka Durnboim. After his engagement Aptowitzer traveled to Vienna, in order to study at the University as well as at the Hebrew Teachers College. He was employed as the personal secretary to Abraham Epstein. In 1909, with the recommendation of David Zvi Miller, Aptowitzer was appointed as a lecturer at the Hebrew Teachers College to replace Meir Friedmann who had died. Solomon Schechter invited him to the United States in 1918 but Aptowitzer turned down the proposal. The scholar Hirsch Perez Chajes appointed him as a teacher in the Israelitisch-Theologischen Lehranstalt (Jewish Theological Seminary) he founded. Aptowitzer served as a professor of Talmud, Bible, Midrash and Jewish philosophy. In 1924 Aptowitzer was invited to an academic position in Jerusalem but he turned down the offer because of his wife's illness. In 1938, after his wife died, Aptowitzer emigrated to Palestine, but by this time there was no position available for him. In Israel he was engaged primarily in editing his papers for publication. Aptowitzer died December 5, 1942 and was buried in Jerusalem's Mount of Olives cemetery. In his last will and testament he asked that his tombstone only state that he edited the works of Ra'avyah; he also asked that his unpublished writings be burned. Throughout his life he suffered from a number of diseases and shortness of vision and in his later years he was blind. Aptowitzer was an observant Jew, scrupulously observing Jewish ritual law. He belonged to the Mizrachi Zionist movement and he lectured in Vienna in Hebrew. Works Aptowitzer was a renaissance man ‚Äì his expertise covered wide areas of Judaic studies, including Talmud, Bible, halachic literature ‚Äì especially the period of the Geonim and Rishonim ‚Äì the literature of the aggadah, Jewish law and Jewish history. His most important contribution is his edition of the work of Ra'avyah (Eliezer ben Yoel HaLevi) which includes a comprehensive scholarly introduction and copious notes. The first volumes were published by the Me·∏≥i·∫ìe Nirdamim society in Berlin in 1912 and in Jerusalem in 1935.Sefer Rabiah.

It is on the southeast rim of a submerged circular depression known as Charity Shoal Crater that may be the remnants of a meteorite impact. The lighthouse is located in Jefferson County, New York, near the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border. The tower originally served Vermilion Light Station in Ohio from 1877 to 1929, and was installed at its current New York location in 1935. The lighthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in March 2008. East Charity Shoal Light has been privately owned since 2009, however easements are in place to maintain the light's function as a navigational aid. Description East Charity Shoal Light sits upon a reinforced concrete pier, long on each side, that rises approximately above Lake Ontario. The pier is built on a wooden crib foundation with protective riprap. The tower includes a single-story concrete deckhouse that is tall and in diameter. Above the deckhouse rises a three-story cast iron white tower, topped with a lantern and lantern gallery that is painted black. The light's interior includes a basement and five stories. The total height of the pier and tower is . The automated beacon is powered by a solar array, sits at a focal height of , and is visible for . East Charity Shoal Light is not open to the public, but it is visible from Tibbetts Point Light on a clear day. History The tower was constructed from recast obsolescent cannon after the Battle of Fort Sumter in the American Civil War. It originally served Vermilion Light Station in Ohio from 1877 to 1929, but was removed after it was damaged in an ice storm. A replica of the tower was installed at Vermilion in 1991. Prior to the installation of the East Charity Shoal Light, the shoal was the cause of at least one shipwreck, when the Rosedale grounded upon the rocks on December 5, 1897. The shoal was surveyed in 1900, and was found to be an area roughly long that was covered in water approximately deep. A buoy was installed on the eastern edge of the shoal, however groundings continued to occur, leading the United States Lighthouse Service to initiate the installation of a more permanent navigational aid. Construction of the concrete pier for East Charity Shoal Light began in 1934, and the tower was installed in 1935. The tower was originally lit with a fourth-order Fresnel lens and a 1,300 candlepower light fueled by acetylene. On July 23, 2008, the Secretary of the Interior identified East Charity Shoal Light as surplus under the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act of 2000. As such, the property was offered by the federal government for no cost to eligible agencies, institutions or organizations, with the agreement that the property would be maintained and made available for educational, recreational, or historic preservation purposes. No organization eligible under the NHLHPA was found to take ownership of the lighthouse. In 2009, East Charity Shoal Light was put up for auction and was eventually purchased for $25,501 by Cyrena Nolan of Dallas, Texas on August 27, 2009. At the time of the purchase, Nolan intended to convert the lighthouse into a vacation home. Although the property was transferred to private ownership, the light remains operational and the Aid to Navigation (ATON) remains the property of the United States Coast Guard. An easement is in place to allow for access to maintain or modify the navigational light. The easement also disallows construction of any structure that would interfere with visibility of the light.

It is similar to the Central European kopytka. They take various forms and can be referred to with a variety of names in different regions. They are usually made from rye or wheat flour and egg. Since the introduction of the potato to Germany in the seventeenth century, Schupfnudeln have also been made with potatoes. They are traditionally given their distinctive ovoid shape through hand-shaping. They are often served as a savory dish with sauerkraut but are also served in sweet dishes. Development Schupfnudeln have been known as a trooper dish since the Thirty Years' War: out of their daily flour ration and water the soldiers formed long noodles, which they cooked afterwards. After the potato was imported to and cultivated in Germany in the 17th century, the recipe was modified and different variations emerged according to different regions. Regional terms and forms Though they can be found throughout Germany, they are especially popular in the cuisine of Baden and Swabia. There, in addition to Schupfnudeln they are called Baunzen or Bubenspitzle (literally meaning \\"little boys' penis\\"). In Bavarian cuisine they are known as Fingernudeln (finger noodles), Dradewixpfeiferl, Kartoffel- or Erdepfebaunkerl (potato Baunkerl) or Schupfnudeln, and in Upper Palatinate they are called Schopperla or Schoppala. In the Odenwald their name is Krautnudeln (cabbage noodles) and in the Palatinate they are called Buwespitzle. The Bauchstecherla in Franconia are a bit thinner and more pointed. A special variety of these noodles is called Mohnnudeln (poppy seed noodles) and can be found throughout Bavaria and Austria. Etymology and preparation The name Schupf- or Fingernudel refers to the preparation and shape of the noodle and not to the ingredients. The word Schupf comes from schupfen in the regional sense \\"to roll, flatten\\".Duden online There is no single authentic recipe; instead there are many widely different ways of preparation in different regions. Many of these variations claim to be the original and authentic Schupfnudeln. This disagreement is reflected in reference works. The large 10-volume version of the Duden (the preeminent German dictionary) says that Schupfnudels are a fried dishDuden, das gro√üe W√∂rterbuch der deutschen Sprache in 10 B√§nden, 1999, : ‚Äûin Fett gebackenes, kleines, l√§ngliches St√ºck aus Kartoffelp√ºree, Mehl u. Ei‚Äú while Ludwig Zehetner writes in his Bavarian Dictionary that they are boiled in salt water. Simple recipes only use rye flour and water for the dough, but many recipes include mashed potatoes, wheat flour and egg. The dough is kneaded and then rolled into a long, thin cylinder. This roll is cut into pieces about half an inch in width. These are rolled into the typical shape of Schupfnudeln. Afterwards they are either cooked in salty water for about ten minutes or deep fried. Many recipes include frying them in a pan afterwards as well. Subsequently they are served in different ways: savory with sage butter or sauerkraut or sweet with poppy seeds, sugar and cinnamon. In all cases it is necessary that the relatively bland noodles incorporate the flavor of the other ingredients. Schupfnudeln can be served either as a side dish or as a main dish. Schupfnudeln pan fried with bacon bits and sauerkraut are commonly served at public wine festivals throughout Baden and Swabia. In Swabia, Schupfnudeln are often served with cold fruits like cold stewed apples or pears.

It is found six miles off the mainland of Jefferson Country which is part of the state of New York. According to its location, it falls under the jurisdiction of the town of Hounsfield. The light tower and the majority of the island are privately owned. However, because of the law, the Coast Guard is permitted to cross into this private property because of the light in the tower that is used to guide ships. The lighthouse is a fixed white light that produces a beam that is visible at a maximum distance of 15 miles. It also consists of a steam whistle that it sounds when the weather turns foggy. The whistle blows for 10 seconds and then it is silent for 30 seconds. The island does not have a harbor and landings have to be made from smaller boats. Today it stands tall and abandoned, overlooking the waves.  Galloo Island  The island, on which this lighthouse is constructed, covers approximately 3.46 mi2 . At its furthest point, the island spans a total of 4.47 mi in length and has a breadth of 1.49 mi. It also covers a total of 2,217 by 28.8 acres of land respectively. At 23/8 miles WNW, Stony Island is the closest island to this land mass. This island, previously spelled \\"Galloup\\", sits on the eastern side of Lake Ontario and can be located near the entrance of the Sackets Harbor. It sits on the outer edge of a group of islands and shoals which guard the entrance to Sackets Harbor and the Saint Lawrence River. The island was placed on auction and is currently owned by its highest bidder: Cara C. Dibnah. She comes from Vallejo, California.  History  On April 21, 1818, legislation was passed so that a huge portion of Galloo island could be officially handed over to the government of the United States of America for the sole purpose of erecting a lighthouse. Congress had set aside $12,500 for the construction of this lighthouse which was to be built in the Southwest end so that it could mark the outer lying islands and shoals that the ships frequently came across when traveling to St. Lawrence River or the nearby Sackets Harbor. The first light on the island was established in 1820. Magazines and Gazette published this happening. The government paid David. O a total amount of $411 for the 30 acres near the southwestern part of the island that had been designated for the lighthouse. The construction of the tower and its dwelling was handed over to Elisha Ely. On 15 February 1823, Galloo island fell under the legal protection of Elisha Camp. It was then annexed to the town of Hounsfield. The construction of the lighthouse was finally completed in 1867. After much lobbying from the lighthouse keepers, the light was finally automated in 1963. In the year 1983, it was added to the National Register of Historic places as the first lighthouse to be erected in Lake Ontario. The lighthouse was abandoned and in August 1999, the island was purchased by a private company called PRK Holdings Group of Syracuse. The tower and the keeper's house went on auction set up by the U.S General Services Administration Building Office of Surplus Property on the 27th of September 2000.

The tower is primarily a circular shape which forms a conical shape from top to bottom when viewed sideways. There is only one other separate light. The tower covers a total of 60 feet when measured from the base to the top of the ventilator ball. The height of the focal plane above means high water is about 58 feet and 3 inches. The lighthouse is in Grey color and most of its base is made out of a 4-inch-thick wall so that the tower can withstand strong winds. The lantern has a polygonal shape and is 6 feet and 10 inches in diameter. It has a total of 10 sides and most of its bars are vertical. The lantern doors and the floor of the lantern are both made out of cast iron. The steam whistle that is blown during fog is about 10 inches in diameter. It is operated by Crosby Automatic Apparatus. It was manufactured by a local company called Thomson Kingsford based in Oswego, NY. It has a total height of about 20 inches. It is placed at the top of the lighthouse building.

It is used in combination with changes in diet in adults with hypertriglyceridemia ‚â• 150 mg/dL. It is made from the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the approval of it (as Vascepa) in 2012, to Amarin Corporation, and it became the second fish oil-based medication after omega-3 acid ethyl esters, brand named Lovaza, which was approved in 2004. On 13 December 2019, FDA also approved it as the first drug specifically \\"to reduce cardiovascular risk among patients with elevated triglyceride levels\\". The most common side effects are musculoskeletal pain, peripheral edema (swelling of legs and hands), atrial fibrillation, and arthralgia (joint pain). It is has been approved by the FDA as a generic medication.However due to ongoing patent litigation, the generic companies have not brought the generic version to market. Oral arguments are scheduled in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for September 3, 2020, at 10:00 am. Medical use Ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA) is used in addition to changes in diet to reduce triglyceride levels in adults with severe (‚â• 500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia. Or it may be used in hypertriglyceridemia ‚â• 150 mg/dL in those with risk factors for heart disease. Intake of large doses (2.0 to 4.0 g/day) of long- chain omega-3 fatty acids as prescription drugs or dietary supplements are generally required to achieve significant (> 15%) lowering of triglycerides, and at those doses the effects can be significant (from 20% to 35% and even up to 45% in individuals with levels greater that 500 mg/dL). It appears that both eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) lower triglycerides, however, DHA alone appears to raise low-density lipoprotein (the variant which drives atherosclerosis; sometimes very inaccurately called: \\"bad cholesterol\\") and LDL-C values (always only a calculated estimate; not measured by labs from person's blood sample for technical and cost reasons), whilst eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) alone does not and instead lowers the parameters aforementioned. = Other fish-oil based drugs = There are other omega-3 fish-oil based drugs on the market that have similar uses and mechanisms of action: * Omega-3 acid ethyl esters (brand names Omarcor, Lovaza, and Omtryg) and, as of March 2016, four generic versions;FDA Omega-3 acid ethyl esters products Page accessed 31 March 2016 * Omega-3 carboxylic acids (Epanova); the Epanova brand name was discontinued in the United States. =Dietary supplements= There are many fish oil dietary supplements on the market. Evidence does not support a beneficial role for n-3 dietary supplements to reduce cardiovascular disease as an addition to contemporary medical therapy including statin therapy. The ingredients of dietary supplements are not as carefully controlled as prescription products and have not been fixed and tested in clinical trials, as prescription drugs have, and the prescription forms are more concentrated, requiring fewer capsules to be taken and increasing the likelihood of compliance.  Side effects  Special caution should be taken with people who have fish and shellfish allergies. In addition, as with other omega-3 fatty acids, taking ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA) puts people who are on anticoagulants at risk for prolonged bleeding time. The most commonly reported side effect in clinical trials has been joint pain; some people also reported pain in their mouth or throat. E-EPA has not been tested in pregnant women and is rated pregnancy category C; it is excreted in breast milk and the effects on infants are not known. Pharmacology After ingestion, ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA) is metabolized to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). EPA is absorbed in the small intestine and enters circulation. Peak plasma concentration occurs about 5 hours after ingestion and the half-life is about 89 hours. EPA is metabolized mostly in the liver like other dietary fatty acids. Mechanism of action Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), the active metabolite of ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA), like other omega-3 fatty acid based drugs, appears to reduce production of triglycerides in the liver, and to enhance clearance of triglycerides from circulating very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles; the way it does that is not clear, but potential mechanisms include increased breakdown of fatty acids; inhibition of diglyceride acyltransferase which is involved in biosynthesis of triglycerides in the liver; and increased activity of lipoprotein lipase in blood. Chemistry Ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA) is an ethyl ester of eicosapentaenoic acid, which is an omega-3 fatty acid. History In July 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA) for severe hypertriglyceridemia as an adjunct to dietary measures; Amarin Corporation had developed the drug.CenterWatch Vascepa (icosapent ethyl) Page accessed 31 March 2016 Amarin Corporation, challenged the FDA's authority to limit its ability to market the drug for off-label use and won its case on appeal in 2012, changing the way the FDA regulates the marketing of medication. Ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA) was the second fish-oil drug to be approved, after omega-3 acid ethyl esters (GlaxoSmithKline's Lovaza which was approved in 2004VHA Pharmacy Benefits Management Strategic Healthcare Group and the Medical Advisory Panel. October 2005 National PBM Drug Monograph Omega-3-acid ethyl esters (Lovaza, formerly Omacor)) and sales were not as robust as Amarin had hoped. The labels for the two drugs were similar, but doctors prescribed Lovaza for people who had triglycerides lower than 500 mg/dL based on some clinical evidence. Amarin wanted to actively market E-EPA for that population as well which would have greatly expanded its revenue, and applied to the FDA for permission to do so in 2013, which the FDA denied. In response, in May 2015 Amarin sued the FDA for infringing its First Amendment rights, and in August 2015, a judge ruled that the FDA could not \\"prohibit the truthful promotion of a drug for unapproved uses because doing so would violate the protection of free speech.\\" The ruling left open the question of what the FDA would allow Amarin to say about E-EPA, and in March 2016 the FDA and Amarin agreed that Amarin would submit specific marketing material to the FDA for the FDA to review, and if the parties disagreed on whether the material was truthful, they would seek a judge to mediate. In December 2019, the FDA approved the use of icosapent ethyl as an adjunctive (secondary) therapy to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events among adults with elevated triglyceride levels (a type of fat in the blood) of 150 milligrams per deciliter or higher. Patients must also have either established cardiovascular disease or diabetes and two or more additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Icosapent ethyl is the first FDA approved drug to reduce cardiovascular risk among patients with elevated triglyceride levels as an add-on to maximally tolerated statin therapy. The efficacy and safety of icosapent ethyl were established in a study with 8,179 patients who were either 45 years and older with a documented history of coronary artery, cerebrovascular, carotid artery and peripheral artery disease, or 50 years and older with diabetes and additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Patients who received icosapent ethyl were significantly less likely to experience a cardiovascular event, such as a stroke or heart attack. In clinical trials, icosapent ethyl was associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (irregular heart rhythms) requiring hospitalization. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater among patients with a history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Icosapent ethyl was also associated with an increased risk of bleeding events. The incidence of bleeding was higher among patients who were also taking other medications that increase the risk of bleeding, such as aspirin, clopidogrel or warfarin at the same time.

Funds for the lighthouse were approved by United States Congress on August 31, 1852 and the structure was completed in 1856. The lighthouse, built to serve as a rear range light to mark Swash Channel (a shipping channel in Lower New York Bay), was built by Richard Carlow, who also built the similar Chapel Hill and Point Comfort Range Lights in New Jersey around the same time. Ships sailing through Swash Channel were instructed to bring the New Dorp range light ‚Äúin one‚Äù and steer towards the lights until the Chapel Hill Light came into view, which would then mark the channel past West Bank. The original beacon was a second-order range lens showing a fixed red light that shined above sea level. In 1891 the light was changed to fixed white. In 1907 the light source was changed from oil to incandescent oil vapor, which magnified the intensity of the light. In 1939 a sixth-order range lens was installed, showing a fixed white light. John B. Fountain was the first light keeper, who resided in the light keepers house upon which the lighthouse tower was built. The New Dorp Lighthouse was decommissioned and boarded up in 1964. The lighthouse and land were neglected and vandalized for ten years until being sold at auction to a Staten Island resident named John Vokral for $32,000 in 1974.

It a conical steel structure erected in the 1880s. In 1979 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The need for a lighthouse to warn ships away from the shoals near the common route off Tarrytown and Ossining had been obvious by the mid-19th century. But high land values at two favored locations led the federal government to instead build it a offshore. It was the only family station on the lower Hudson, the only conical steel lighthouse on the Hudson to have living quarters within it rather than attached to it, and the only lighthouse in Westchester County. It remained in use until the mid-20th century; the construction of the Tappan Zee Bridge on the shoals where it stood and the development of the General Motors Tarrytown Truck Assembly plant on land reclaimed from the river to its east made the light obsolete. Today it is part of a county park, and tours are available. Building The lighthouse is situated just off the riverbank at the southern end of Kingsland Point Park. A 100-foot (30 m) pedestrian bridge and riprap breakwater connects it to the shore. To its immediate east is a large vacant area, once the site of the General Motors North Tarrytown Assembly plant. Between it and the developed sections of Tarrytown are the tracks used by Metro-North Railroad's Hudson Line, Amtrak's Empire Service, and CSX freight. The three-mile‚Äìlong (5 km) Tappan Zee Bridge carries the New York State Thruway across the river a mile (1.6 km) to the south. The building itself is a five-story conical structure on a foundation of a stone pier and cast iron caisson, that holds a concrete cylinder which accounts for half the lighthouse's weight, securing it in the river bottom. It is faced in welded steel plates. The base is painted red, the tower white, and the lantern room black. There are eight windows at alternating intervals on the second and third stories, eight portholes evenly spaced around the fourth story, and glazed glass around the lantern room. A catwalk, with a roof supported by iron columns, encircles the first story and provides access to the main entrance. Two additional catwalks are located around the fifth floor and the lantern room; the latter has a decorative iron railing. A flagpole rises from the fifth-floor catwalk's east side. Inside, the entrance leads to the main living area, an 18-foot-wide () living room and kitchen. Above them, the second and third stories, both wide, had bedrooms. The wall interiors are faced in brick to better insulate them. The fourth floor, currently empty, was divided between a bedroom and a workshop. Its ceiling has glass inserts to allow light from the lantern to filter down into it. From it a ladder leads up to the watch area and lantern room. The fog bell remains there, but its works have been removed. In the cellar are the original coal shed and cistern. A central column carries the cables and weight that rotate the lantern. History Navigational aids had been part of travel on the river since before Europeans had arrived, and the hazardous shoals near the Tarrytowns had long been known. But even after the growth in commerce fueled by industrialization during the 19th century, it took a considerable amount of time to find a site for the lighthouse. It remained in service until the Tappan Zee Bridge's construction made it redundant; since then expansion of the shoreline has also ended its isolation. =Prehistory‚Äì1882: The need for Hudson River lighthouses= The various Native American peoples who lived along its banks used the river European settlers would later name after Henry Hudson, the first of them to explore it, for commerce and trade. They were aware of the navigational hazards it offered their canoes, and built bonfires on the shores nearest tricky currents and hidden shallows. Colonists followed them as first sailing ships, then steamships, carried goods and passengers between New York City and the upper limit of navigable waters at Troy. Commerce sharply increased in the 1820s with the development of the Erie and Delaware and Hudson canals. The former connected the East Coast with the recently settled Midwest; the latter brought anthracite coal from Northeastern Pennsylvania to New York City. The development of the railroad in the mid-19th century took much, but not all, of this traffic, and river shipping continues today.Barry, Elise; ; National Park Service; February 26, 1979; retrieved September 9, 2011; p. 6. To assist the ships, 14 lighthouses were built at various navigational hazards along the river. Six of them besides Tarrytown remain, from Peter's Hook in Manhattan to Hudson‚ÄìAthens south of Albany, between those two communities. The shoals a half-mile (1 km) off Tarrytown and Ossining (then known as Sing Sing) on the east bank of the river at the southern end of Haverstraw Bay were particularly dangerous as mariners preferred to use that side. In 1847 a location for a light was identified at Teller's Point, the southern tip of Croton Point just north of Ossining, at the north end of the shoal. That land was then used as a vineyard and its owner asked a higher price than the government was willing to pay. The following year Congress appropriated $4,000 ($ in modern dollars) to acquire a different site near Tarrytown, at the end of Tarrytown Point, the peninsula created by the outflow of sediment from the Pocantico River. Steamboat captains consulted by the government suggested that the light should instead be located at Beekman's Point, two miles (3.2 km) away. Its owner likewise asked $3,000, which would not have left enough money to build the actual lighthouse. alt=A black-and-white photograph of an elderly man with a long white beard wearing a hat A red spar buoy marked the downriver end of the shoals in the meantime. Eventually, the current site, then offshore, was chosen. Construction began in 1882 at a cost of almost $21,000 ($ in modern dollars). Stones were piled on the shoal as part of its foundation and a boat dock was built. The prefabricated sections of the 60-foot-tall (18 m) sparkplug lighthouse arrived on a barge; the structure was assembled using anchored boats and scaffolding. It would be the only one in Westchester County, the only conical steel structure of the seven to have living quarters and the only one on the lower Hudson that could house a keeper and his family. Its original white lantern, with a fourth-order Fresnel lens, could reportedly be seen up to away. =1883‚Äì1961: Active years= In 1883 it was formally lit. It was technically within the municipal boundaries of North Tarrytown (now Sleepy Hollow) but has been known as Tarrytown Light on navigational charts since its construction. Jacob Ackerman, a retired schooner captain who had become president (mayor) of North Tarrytown, was the first of ten keepers. He served in the position until his retirement in 1904, saving 19 lives during that time. In 1894, 11 years after it was lit, its lantern was changed from white to red. Over time it became a local landmark. \\"The Tarrytown Lighthouse is a familiar sight to the landsman, and its kindly warning rays are always welcomed by mariners\\", wrote local journalist Isaac De Goff in a 1902 guide to the area. alt=A black-and-white illustration showing the lighthouse at left surrounded by water and the shore at right. Faint writing across the top reads \\"Hudson River, showing Lighthouse and Maxwell‚ÄìBriscoe factory, Tarrytown, N.Y.\\" In 1902 the lantern was changed again from solid red to flashing. Apart from routine reinforcement to the riprap and replacement of the dock no changes were made to the lighthouse building itself until the 1940s, when modern sanitary facilities were added. In 1947, an electrical connection was installed, eliminating the need for the kerosene lamps that had provided routine illumination within the lighthouse. During the next decade, the original coal-fired steam heating system was replaced with modern forced air, and the sanitary facilities were further upgraded. =1961‚Äìpresent: Deactivation and preservation= Around that time the Tappan Zee Bridge was built and opened to traffic. One of its piers, with its own set of navigational lights, sat on the shoals which the lighthouse had been designed to warn against, channeling shipping away from them. The Coast Guard responded by automating the light and reducing the flashing red lantern from 7000 candlepower to 1500 in 1957. The need for the lighthouse was further reduced two years later when the federal government declared all but the hundred feet (30 m) of river bottom around the lighthouse to be surplus property, so that General Motors (GM) could fill in the area between it and the shore in order to expand its Tarrytown Truck Assembly plant, a facility that incorporated the original Stanley Steamer factory built east of the railroad tracks in 1896. Two years later, in 1961, the light was decommissioned. Tarrytown Light, 1997 The lighthouse remained. In 1974, the county obtained an easement from GM to build a footpath from nearby Kingsland Point Park to the lighthouse. The following year it built the path, and a small bridge, allowing the public to walk from the park to the lighthouse. The county also acquired the lighthouse itself, a purchase that was disputed by the Coast Guard at the time of its listing on the National Register. Occasionally tours of the building are offered. On June 10, 2015, the lighthouse was re-lighted in a civic ceremony after being re-fitted with a new replica Fresnel lens. William Osbourne Sininger 1939-1941 US Coast Guard Operations Original keepers such as Ackerman lived an austere existence. They kept a daily log of weather conditions, maintenance, and any significant events that occurred during the day. It was collected every month by the Lighthouse Service, and in later years, the Coast Guard, which absorbed the Lighthouse Service in 1939 with original keeper US Coast Guard William Osborne Sininger, his wife Lillian Letitia Christobal Smith Sininger and son William David Sininger being the first family living in the light house A coal-fired furnace fed the steam- heating system. Water for bathing and drinking was initially collected from rains on the roof and stored in the basement cistern. Coal for refueling the furnace was dropped off by boat. All food had to be obtained by the keeper from land, either by boating to Tarrytown or walking across the ice (a potentially dangerous trip) in winter. The lantern and fog bell were powered by a battery; there was no other electricity in the lighthouse for its first 60 years. All lighting came from kerosene lamps. In 1943, Laurent LeClerc moved in with his wife and three children. During their time, further amenities were introduced, such as household electricity, running water and modern forced air heating. The LeClercs were succeeded by what became another family, the Morelands, who became the last keepers of Tarrytown Light. In 1955, the Coast Guard offered a 20-year-old recruit, Richard Moreland, the position. He moved in with his new wife, Agnes, an Irish immigrant who had been fascinated by the lighthouses near her home in her native country. During the two years they lived there, before the lighthouse was automated after the bridge was built, she gave birth to the couple's two daughters. alt=A black- and-white photograph of the lighthouse shore with a boat docked in front and people walking on the dock. The western shore of the Hudson is visible in the background The Morelands have spoken to journalists, including Edward R. Murrow, about family life in a lighthouse that was still, at the time, a half- mile from the nearest land. The Coast Guard supplied them with water, so they no longer needed to rely on the cistern, although it was still kept full. It was necessary to go back to the land at least every two days for milk, and they bought groceries every two weeks. The couple could never go out together as one of them had to remain at the lighthouse at all times. During one power outage, Richard Moreland hung an emergency kerosene lamp in the lantern house and rang the fog bell himself. Other than the isolation, they found the most difficult aspect of living in the lighthouse to be making rectilinear furniture fit against the curved walls. For fun, they primarily watched television, or fished from the front door. Richard Moreland would occasionally swim in the river, with a rope tied around his waist so the currents would not carry him away. He said it was the best job in the Coast Guard since he did not have to pay for housing, and no traveling salesman came to call.

Unlike white balance, black balance is not adjusted every time. This function is found in higher end 'professional' cameras rather than in cameras for amateurs. Purpose The main purpose of black balance is to eliminate any residual current being output from the pixel sites under conditions of complete darkness, often referred to as thermal noise. This is why the camera automatically closes the iris completely when it does the black balance. Conditions under which black balance are typically done are when the camera experiences a large change in operating temperature, especially from colder to warmer. Otherwise, it is a periodic thing to allow for other minor factors that could come into play. With CMOS sensor technology, black balancing may not be as necessary as it is with CCD type devices. It is common to talk about how clean and relatively noise free CMOS sensors are by design. Availability Black balancing is done only in professional cameras. Amateur handycam users need not worry about black balance. Professional camcorders like the Sony DSR 400, Panasonic DVC Pro etc. have a switch which has to be flicked upwards to do the white balance. The same switch when pressed downwards does a black balance. In the Panasonic 102 3ccd series, the white balance switch when pressed just once triggers white balancing and when depressed and held for a few seconds completes the black balance. Most camera operators never touch the black balance. Black balance can be done if the colours do not seem to be truly represented even after doing the white balance. Frequency of black balance adjustment There is a lot of debate on whether it is necessary to do the black balance every time. Panasonic 102 XB camera operating instructions manual suggests that black balance be performed when: *The camera is used for the first time *The camera is first used after a long period of disuse *The ambient temperature changes greatly *When switching to normal shutter or slow shutter *When switching between progressive and interlaced modes References * mediacollege.com *Panasonic AXB 102B operating instructions manual *dvinfo.net Category:Image processing ","title":"Black balance"},{"id":"20950072","text":"Auto-linking is a mechanism for automatically determining which libraries to link to while building a C, C++ or Obj-C program.

Photo Cpl. John Scott Rafoss USMC Operation Sond Chara (Red Dagger in Pashto) was an 18-day-long campaign with its aims and objectives centred on four Taliban strongholds near the town of Nad-e-Ali in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. The operation was named after the commando patch worn by members of 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines. 1,500 British troops were involved, supported by Danish, Estonian and Afghan forces in the pre-Christmas offensive, commencing on 7 December 2008 with a night attack on Taliban defences in a village south of the operational area. The offensive was intended to secure the area around the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah after an increase in insurgent attacks there (including a 300-man Taliban assault), as well as helping to safeguard a planned voter registration programme. The hard fought battles were against well-armed insurgents, who held fast and retaliated with 107mm rockets but eventually withdrew under a barrage of British mortar, tank, and missile fire. British troops were fighting knee-deep in mud during First World War-style trench battles. Some sections of the Marines fought while advancing over 60 km under fire and in poor conditions. CQB fighting was common, and some commanders reported fighting at ranges of 30 metres or less. By its climax on 25 December 2008, 100 Taliban fighters, one reportedly a senior commander, were killed. By the end of the offensive five British soldiers, including an Australian serving with British forces, had been killed. After a raid south of Lashkar Gah, ¬£2 million worth of opium was found, alongside IEDs and other assorted drugs and explosives. Brigadier Gordon Messenger, commander of Task Force Helmand, classes the campaign as \\"very successful\\". In respect of the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha, a two-day ceasefire starting on 8 December 2008 was upheld. Recommencing operations on 11 December, 42 Commando Royal Marines attacked both from the ground and the air on Nad-e-Ali, securing an area which had been an insurgent stronghold. Commandos backed by the 2nd Battalion The Princesses of Wales's Royal Regiment and the Afghan National Army attacked and captured the town of Shin Kalay, west of Lashkar Gah. K Company (Black Knights) fought in the trenches surrounding the area, forcing the withdrawal of the insurgents. Royal Engineers found their efforts to build patrol bases hampered by heavy rain turning the ground into a sea of mud. Lima Company, 42 Commando saw the most ferocious close-quarters fighting during the 360-degree battle for Zarghun Kalay, northwest of Lashkar Gah, on 17 December. They were supported by Juliet Company during the following days. By the end of the operation the Marines of Lima Company Group had covered over 60 km on foot in the most arduous conditions. Involved in intense firefights by day, and 'yomping' (walking) by night, the Marines slept rough, eating wherever and whenever they could for 17 days.

He was convicted of conspiracy and obstruction of justice stemming from his relationship with gangster Stephen Flemmi and the Winter Hill Gang. Schneiderhan had warned an associate of fugitive mob boss James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger that Bulger's brothers' phones were being monitored by the FBI. Biography Schneiderhan was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts to working-class immigrants from Riedlingen, Donau, Germany. He grew up in a tenement at 25 Ambrose Street in Roxbury, in the predominantly Italian Orchard Park neighborhood where the Patriarca crime family capo Ilario Zannino, Ilario's first cousin Phillip Zannino, and the Flemmi brothers, were born and raised. As a childhood friend of the brothers Vincent Flemmi, Michael Flemmi and Stephen Flemmi, he idolized Stephen and maintained a friendship with him into adulthood. He graduated from high school in 1952. He served in the Marine Corps and was a veteran of the Korean War. After his honorable discharge he joined the Boston Police Department, where he worked with (now Detective) Michael Flemmi and Detective Joseph Lundbaum. In 1959 he joined the Massachusetts State Police. From 1968 to 1978 he worked in the Attorney General's Organized Crime Unit, where he rose to chief intelligence officer and was regarded as an expert on organized crime. Working in the unit gave him access to information that could help his friend Stephen Flemmi, now a powerful figure in the Winter Hill Gang. It has been suggested, but never proven, that he accepted bribes for this information. When Flemmi went to jail in 1999, Schneiderhan kept in touch with him and with Kevin Weeks, Bulger's deputy, who knew that Schneiderhan had done many favors for the gang. In September 1999, Schneiderhan learned from his brother-in-law about the FBI telephone surveillance of Bulger's brothers. He informed Weeks, who in turn informed Bulger. Two months later, Weeks was arrested on racketeering charges, and he began cooperating with the authorities, which included helping to find the bodies of six gang victims and giving up Schneiderhan. Schneiderhan was called to testify before grand jury corruption hearings because of his relationship with Flemmi and the Winter Hill Gang. In letters to his son Eric, he had written that if he ever got into a jam with the law he should contact \\"Paul\\". When Eric told the grand jury he wasn't sure if \\"Paul\\" was his father's code name for Flemmi, he was indicted for perjury, but found not guilty at trial. On March 19, 2003, Schneiderhan was convicted of conspiracy and obstruction of justice. His two co-defendants, his brother-in-law and niece, pleaded guilty for their roles in warning of the FBI telephone surveillance and were sentenced to one year of custody. Schneiderhan was remanded to the Federal Correctional Complex in Butner, North Carolina. He was released on October 4, 2006 and lived in Holbrook, Massachusetts. In August 2003, the Massachusetts State Board of Retirement ruled that the disability pension Schneiderhan began receiving when he retired in 1984 should continue because he was no longer a member of the state police when he committed his crimes. On September 16, 2015, Schneiderhan died at his home in Holbrook, Massachusetts.

They spent their early years in the lower leagues, indeed it wasn't until the 1990s that the club began to win major honours. A Federal Cup win 1990 was quickly followed IN 1992 by a runners-up spot in the National 2 league now called the National Division 1 after losing out to Saint-Hyppolite XIII 12-20. The club was offered and accepted promotion to the 2nd tier. After a couple of seasons in mid-table they then reached the league final in 95/96 losing out to RC Salon XIII 16-30.

The name describes the size of the shells, 12 inches in diameter, and the length of the bore in calibers (bore diameters), or 50 feet. Design and production The gun was designed in 1939, and a prototype was tested in 1942. Unlike previous guns, such as the 16\\"/45 caliber guns used on the , which were completely made and assembled at the Naval Gun Factory in Washington D.C., the forgings for the Mark 8 were manufactured at the Midvale and Bethlehem Steel Corporation. They were then sent to the Naval Gun Factory for processing, which was followed by a trip to Watervliet Arsenal until they were 65% complete. Finally, the built-up guns were sent back to the Naval Gun Factory to be finished. The gun was first deployed in 1944, on the lead ship of the Alaska class, . The two Alaska-class ships each had nine Mark 8 guns mounted in three triple (3-gun) turrets, with two turrets forward and one aft, a configuration known as \\"2-A-1\\". Only two vessels of the class were completed, making them the only applications of the Mark 8 12\\"/50 caliber gun.  Measurements  The Mark 8 weighed including the breech and was capable of an average rate of fire of 2.4-3 rounds a minute. It could throw a 1,140 lb.

JLA: The Ultimate Guide to the Justice League of America. Grand Rapids: Dorling Kindersley, Incorporated, 2002. The series restarted DC's approach to the Justice League, which had initially featured most of the company's top-tier superheroes but shifted in the 1980s to featuring a rotating cast of established characters alongside newer ones and also saw that franchise expand to several spin-off series, diluting the prestige of the name brand. When relaunched by writer Grant Morrison, the team again focused on the most recognizable, powerful, and long-lasting heroes in DC's library.  Publication history  The low sales of the various Justice League spin-off books by the mid-1990sMiller, John J. \\"JANUARY 1997 Comic Book Preorders from Heroes World and Diamond Comic Distributors\\". Comics Buyer's Guide. 2007.prompted DC to revamp the League as a single team (all the various branch teams were disbanded) on a single title. A Justice League of America formed in the September 1996 limited series Justice League: A Midsummer's Nightmare by Mark Waid and Fabian Nicieza. In 1997, DC Comics launched a new Justice League series titled JLA, written by Grant Morrison with art by Howard Porter and inker John Dell. Morrison stayed as writer for the series through issue #41, though several issues had fill-in writers. JLA #18-#21 and #33 were written by Mark Waid. Mark Millar, Devin Grayson and Mark Waid, and J.M. DeMatteis wrote issues #27, 32 and 35, respectively. This series, in an attempt at a \\"back-to-basics\\" approach, used as its core the team's original and most famous seven members (or their successors): Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, the Flash (Wally West), Green Lantern (Kyle Rayner), and the Martian Manhunter.Kirk, Jason. \\"(1997)\\" Yahoo! GeoCities, December 2000 Additionally, the team received a new headquarters, the \\"Watchtower\\", based on the Moon. JLA quickly became DC's best-selling title, a position it enjoyed on and off for several years.Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 278: \\"Renewed as one of DC's most popular titles, JLA ran for 125 issues before its next relaunch. Earning countless spin-off miniseries and specials, the Justice League reclaimed its place atop DC's hit titles list.\\" Morrison introduced the idea of the JLA allegorically representing a pantheon of gods, with their different powers and personalities, incorporating such characters as Zauriel, Big Barda, Orion, the Huntress, Barbara Gordon (the Oracle), Steel (John Henry Irons), and Plastic Man. He also had Aztek, the Tomorrow Woman, and the Green Arrow (Connor Hawke) as temporaries. Under Morrison, the series pitted the League against a variety of enemies including the White Martians, renegade angels, a new incarnation of the Injustice Gang led by Lex Luthor, and the Key. Other foes were the new villain Prometheus, the existing JLA villain Starro the Conqueror, \\"the Ultra-Marines\\", and a futuristic Darkseid. Morrison's run culminated in an arc titled \\"World War III\\", which involves the New Gods preparing the Earth for battle against a creature known as \\"Mageddon\\", a super-sentient weapon of mass destruction. Since this new League included most of DC's most powerful heroes, the focus of the stories changed. The League now dealt only with Earth-shattering, highest-priority threats which could challenge their tremendous combined power. Enemies faced by this new JLA included an invading army of aliens, a malfunctioning war machine from the future, a horde of renegade angels, a newly reformed coalition of villains as a counter-league, mercenaries armed with individualized take-down strategies for each superhero, various cosmic threats, and the enraged spirit of the Earth itself. In addition, because almost all of the members had their own comics, the stories were almost always self-contained, with all chapters occurring within JLA itself and very rarely affecting events outside of that series. Developments from a hero's own title (such as the new costume and electric-based powers temporarily adopted by Superman in 1997‚Äì1998) were reflected in the League's comic book, however. Morrison departed with issue #41, after which the book saw runs by Mark Waid and Joe Kelly. Subsequent to this, the series switched to a series of rotating writers with issue #91 while Kelly (via JLA #100) was given the miniseries Justice League Elite #1-12, which featured the Green Arrow, the Flash, and several other characters. The new format saw stories by John Byrne, Chuck Austen, and Kurt Busiek. Geoff Johns and Allan Heinberg would take over the book with #115, which saw a multi-part storyline dealing with the aftermath of Identity Crisis, and served as a lead-in to the events of \\"Infinite Crisis\\", as Superboy-Prime destroyed the Watchtower at the end of issue #119. Bob Harras wrote the book's final storyline (JLA #120‚Äì125) as the Green Arrow struggled in vain to keep the League afloat.  Storylines  Despite all of this, DC did not create continuing spinoff series as it had done before. Instead, a large number of miniseries and one-shots featuring the team were released. One spin-off team, the Justice League Elite was created following the events of JLA #100, but their miniseries was limited to 12 issues, and the team appeared only once after the miniseries ended its run. JLA's popularity was also able to launch the critically acclaimed JSA series, which was relaunched as Justice Society of America to coincide with the new Justice League of America book. In 2005, a story arc by Geoff Johns and Alan Heinberg called \\"Crisis of Conscience\\" (JLA #115‚Äì119) depicted the dissolution of the Justice League of America as the breakdown of trust shown in the 2004 limited series Identity Crisis reached its zenith. At the end of the arc, Superboy-Prime destroyed the Justice League Watchtower. JLA, one of several titles to be cancelled at the conclusion of the Infinite Crisis storyline, ended with issue #125. As depicted in the Villains United: Infinite Crisis Special and the final issue of Infinite Crisis itself, preparations for the defense of Metropolis against an army of organized supervillains required a brief and temporary expansion of the Justice League to its largest roster to date. The main defensive teams of the JLA, JSA, Teen Titans and Outsiders already being occupied elsewhere by the Crisis, it fell on the Oracle and the Martian Manhunter to contact and deputize seemingly every active or once active hero in the DC Universe as Justice League members, effective immediately, to form a last line of defense for the city.  Reception  The new approach worked, and JLA quickly became DC's best-selling title, a position it enjoyed on and off for several years, as reflected in the following advance sales figures for months in which JLA was DC's best-selling title: * January 1997 (78,400) * February 1997 (81,500) * May 1997 (103,500) * June 1997 (104,000) * July 1997 (two issues: 104,900 and 104,400) * August 1997 (104,700) * September 1997 (107,000) * October 1997 (111,200) * November 1997 (111,400) * December 1997 (109,100) * January 1998 (108,900) * February 1998 (101,400) * March 1998 (101,500) * May 1998 (99,500) * June 1998 (100,000) * July 1998 (97,300) * August 1998 (95,300) * September 1998 (100,300) * October 1998 (93,200) * November 1998 (92,200) * January 1999 (89,900) * March 1999 (86,000) * May 1999 (86,500) * June 1999 (86,900) * July 1999 (85,600) * August 1999 (84,000) [5th highest among all publishers] * September 1999 (83,400) [3rd highest among all publishers] * November 1999 (80,000) [5th highest among all publishers] * December 1999 (84,200) [6th highest among all publishers] * January 2000 (78,300) [4th highest among all publishers] * February 2000 (75,200) [6th highest among all publishers] * March 2000 (77,100) [4th highest among all publishers] * April 2000 (73,700) [6th highest among all publishers] * May 2000 (76,900) [4th highest among all publishers] * June 2000 (76,800) [5th highest among all publishers] * July 2000 (75,400) [5th highest among all publishers]  Collected editions  JLA was collected in a series of trade paperbacks: * New World Order (collects JLA #1‚Äì4, 1997, ) * American Dreams (collects JLA #5‚Äì9, 1998, ) * Rock of Ages (collects JLA #10‚Äì15, 1998, ) * Strength in Numbers (collects JLA #16‚Äì23, New Year's Evil: Prometheus #1 and \\"Heroes\\" from JLA Secret Files and Origins #2, 1998 ) * Justice for All (collects JLA #24‚Äì33, 1999, ) * World War III (collects JLA #34‚Äì41, 2000, ) * Tower of Babel (collects JLA #42‚Äì46, JLA Secret Files and Origins #3 and JLA 80-Page Giant #1 ) * Divided We Fall (collects JLA #47‚Äì54 ) * Terror Incognita (collects JLA #55‚Äì60 ) * Golden Perfect (collects JLA #61‚Äì65 ) * The Obsidian Age (Book 1) (collects JLA #66‚Äì71 ) * The Obsidian Age (Book 2) (collects JLA #72‚Äì76 ) * Rules Of Engagement (collects JLA #77‚Äì82 ) * Trial by Fire (collects JLA #84‚Äì89 ) * The Tenth Circle (collects JLA #94‚Äì99 ) * Pain of the Gods (collects JLA #101‚Äì106 ) * Syndicate Rules (collects JLA #107‚Äì114 and a story from JLA Secret Files and Origins 2004 ) * Crisis of Conscience (collects JLA #115‚Äì119 ) * World Without a Justice League (collects JLA #120‚Äì125 ) There is also a Deluxe Edition series: * JLA Deluxe Edition: ** Hardcovers: *** Vol. 1 (collects JLA #1‚Äì9 and JLA Secret Files and Origins #1, 256 pages, deluxe hardcover, September 2008, Titan, , DC, )JLA Deluxe Edition: Vol. 1, DC Comics.com *** Vol. 2 (collects JLA #10‚Äì17, New Year's Evil: Prometheus and JLA/WildC.A.T.S., 320 pages, deluxe hardcover, Titan, July 2009, , DC, June 2009, )JLA Deluxe Edition: Vol. 2, DC Comics.com *** Vol. 3 (collects JLA #18‚Äì31 and 1,000,000, 256 pages, deluxe hardcover.

He is a former Wales under-19 international and has also represented his country at semi- professional level. Career Born in Neath, Bond started his career with Swansea City and spent time on loan at Conference South side Newport County. He made his professional debut for Swansea in a 4‚Äì0 win over Rushden & Diamonds in the Football League Trophy on 22 November 2005, but was released by manager Kenny Jackett in 2005. He joined Port Talbot Town in the Welsh Premier League. Following the appointment of former Swansea player Roberto Mart√≠nez as manager, Bond was handed a trial at Swansea in a pre-season friendly against Hamilton in which he came off the bench to score twice. His performance convinced Martinez to hand him a one-year deal to return to the Liberty Stadium. In early 2008 he was loaned out to Spanish side CF Balaguer and during the summer of 2008 was involved in first-team preparations for the Championship, which included a few appearances on the club's tour of Spain. On 22 August 2009, Bond made his league debut for Swansea when he started in a 1‚Äì0 win over Coventry City. He also went out on loan to Swedish team √ñstersunds FK. Prior to the start of the 2010‚Äì11 season, Bond spent time on trial with Newport County before eventually joining Neath on 5 August 2010. He left the club in June 2011 and joined Llanelli the following month before joining Afan Lido on loan in January 2012. In February 2012 he cut short his loan period at Lido and his contract with Llanelli was terminated by mutual consent. Bond had been on trial in January 2012 with Los Angeles Blues of the USL Professional Division and on leaving Llanelli, his former club reported he was leaving to join the LA Blues having secured a playing contract with the US club. In March 2012 the deal was confirmed by his new club. He then returned home to Wales at the end of the season and joined Port Talbot Town, where he found success. On 20 March 2014, Bond signed for new USL Pro League team Sacramento Republic. Bond cancelled his contract with Sacramento Republic in August 2014, and signed with Port Talbot Town for the third time. Bond returned to the United States in March 2015, signing with Tulsa Roughnecks. He recorded 8 assists in 24 appearances for the club. On 7 January 2016, USL club Saint Louis FC announced that they had signed Bond for the 2016 season. Bond played the 2017 season with USL side OKC Energy FC, but was released at the end of the season.

From 1989 to 1990, Adiah√©not held a minor post in the government as Secretary of State at the Ministry of Public Works and Construction.

As a result of the National Conference, Bongo stepped down from the leadership of the ruling PDG and the existence of other political parties was legalized. Bongo's control of the PDG, which had been the only legal political party since its creation in 1968, had been a key feature of his rule up to that point. The party leadership was then turned over to Adiah√©not,David E. Gardinier and Douglas A.

In the December 2006 parliamentary election, he won the second seat from the Fourth Arrondissement of Libreville;\\"Liste des D√©put√©s par Circonscription\\" , National Assembly website (accessed 5 January 2009) . subsequently his portfolio was modified on 25 January 2007, when he was appointed as Minister of State for Housing, Lodgings, and Urban Planning.

Bongo's son, Ali Bongo, was then designated as the PDG candidate for the 30 August 2009 presidential election. Some leading PDG figures objected to Bongo's nomination and left the party; while Adiah√©not did not quit the PDG, he also made no efforts to assist Bongo's presidential campaign. After Bongo won the election, Adiah√©not was dismissed from the government on 17 October 2009.\\"Gabon: Liste compl√®te du nouveau gouvernement gabonais\\", Gabonews, 17 October 2009 .

Adiah√©not, who had led the PDG through its most difficult period in the early 1990s, was reported to have quit the ruling party in March 2010. That purported decision was not considered surprising; Adiah√©not was close to the various party \\"barons\\" who had left the PDG after Bongo's presidential nomination, and he \\"no longer seemed comfortable\\" in the PDG. He reportedly chose to delay his decision until the PDG's 10th Extraordinary Congress on 13‚Äì14 March 2010, hoping that the congress would facilitate reconciliation, but he was said to be disappointed by the outcome. Speculation immediately centered on the possibility that he would join the National Union, an opposition party dominated by former PDG \\"barons\\". Although Adiah√©not had not officially announced his departure from the PDG, the official Gabonese Press Agency (AGP) published a bitter denunciation of Adiah√©not on 23 March. According to the AGP, Adiah√©not was a manipulative politician who exploited Omar Bongo's generosity, \\"regularly using blackmail and other maneuvers\\". The AGP argued that his departure was predictable because he had already demonstrated disloyalty at the time of the 1993 presidential election and sympathized with the National Union. Scathingly, the AGP wrote that many PDG members in the Estuary Province \\"breathe a sigh of relief and rejoice not to suffer the dictates of a politician whose presence in the 4th arrondissement of the capital does not necessarily mean he enjoys indestructible popularity.\\" The reports of Adiah√©not's resignation produced a brief period of confusion, as Adiah√©not did not confirm that he was leaving the party. He then announced on 27 March, at celebrations marking the 42nd anniversary of the PDG's founding, that he was remaining a member of the PDG. Nevertheless, his future within the party was considered unclear, as he was no longer a member of the Political Bureau.\\"Gabon : Jacques Adiah√©not reste au PDG mais pour combien de temps ?\\" , Gaboneco, 29 March 2010 .

Set on a soundstage of a fictitious movie company, Disaster! was based on the park's former Earthquake: The Big One ride, which comically illustrates how special effects are filmed for use in movies. The attraction's climax cast the riders as movie extras for a movie finale scene involving an earthquake in a subway station. Using high-speed editing techniques, the riders got to see themselves in the form of a movie trailer that included film sequences shot throughout the attraction's pre-show and main ride. In August 2015, Universal announced that the attraction would close on September 8, 2015 to make way for Fast & Furious: Supercharged, based on the blockbuster film franchise. Attraction history Earthquake: The Big One was one of Universal Studios Florida's original attractions, opening with the park on June 7, 1990. While the attraction was principally based on a portion of the Universal Studios Hollywood's Studio Tour, its main inspiration came from the 1974 disaster film epic Earthquake. Over the years, however, fewer and fewer guests knew about the film referenced, so as part of a renovation project, Universal Studios detached the attraction from any existing film property and instead crafted a fictional premise around it by reinventing its storyline. On November 5, 2007, Universal Orlando confirmed the refurbishment on the day that the original Earthquake attraction was permanently closed.‚ÄúDisaster!‚Äù to Hit Universal Studios Orlando: Newly Themed Attraction to Replace Earthquake ‚Äì Press Release The attraction reconstruction itself took 1 month and 3 weeks. Among the changes include a new pre-show experience, and new ride elements that were not in the Earthquake! attraction. The attraction started previews on December 23, 2007, after some technical problems delayed the actual opening. The grand opening took place on January 17, 2008. It was hosted by Universal Orlando Resort President Bill Davis, with Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson making a guest appearance.Full Video of the grand opening of Disaster! On August 25, 2015, Universal officials announced that Disaster! would be closing on September 7, 2015 to make way for a new attraction based on the Fast & Furious film franchise that would open in 2018. The Earthquake: The Big One attraction on the Studio Tour at Universal Studios Hollywood continues to operate as of 2019, under the original title. However, the movie on which it is based is now rarely referenced. =Halloween Horror Nights= The Disaster!/Earthquake: The Big One overflow queue has been used on and off since 1994 to make a haunted house attraction at Halloween Horror Nights.

The studio is going bankrupt and needs visitors to act as extras for key insert scenes. In helping Kincaid complete his film, the visitors are then asked to be a part of the finale sequence involving an earthquake. =Queue= Disaster's queue displays for movie props from fictional Disaster Studios films, including a Meteor-Struck House from Apocageddon, a torn apart plane from 300 Knots Landing, a mechanical shark from Das Schurke (the head from Bruce, one of the mechanical sharks from the Jaws attraction), and a giant tank being consumed by the tentacles from Super Mega Ultra Atomic Chaos. Guests are also greeted to Disaster Studios with a giant mural of destroyed Los Angeles, introducing Frank Kincaid as the \\"Master of Mayhem.\\" Christopher Walken playing \\"Frank Kincaid\\" Guests are introduced to Lonnie, an Assistant Director who casts guests for scenes that he needs to be shot in the soundstages. Guest are then taken into a screening room where Kincaid describes his brand of film-making. He then asks visitors to help him complete his film. After a speech, guests are ushered into another soundstage where the scenes are shot. Audience members that were pre-picked to be involved in the scenes are brought out to perform, and scenes are filmed where a child jumps from one spot to another, villainous lab workers are hit by styrofoam rocks, a man in a pit, a man being thrown around in a flood, a woman screams, and a grandmother hoeing. Kincaid appears on a screen and invites guests to take part in his finale that is being shot next door. =Ride= Some of the ride's vehicles Guests enter a subway station, modeled after BART's West Oakland Station, where they board a subway train (an obvious homage to \\"Earthquake: The Big One\\", which this ride replaced). Small plasma screens on the train direct guests on the reactions needed to successfully shoot the scene. Departing the station, guests travel beneath the bay and soon arrive at the Embarcadero subway station. Shortly after arriving at the station, the lights in the station start to flicker, the second unit director tells the people over the intercom that it's just a slight tremor and that there's no problem. The station then goes dark, then the train is shaken by a violent earthquake. The entire station is seemingly destroyed as large cracks form in the station platforms, sections of the roof collapse, a gasoline tanker falls through the ceiling and bursts into flames, another subway train enters the station and derails, and we the final effect shows a flash flood of water rushes down the stairs and into the station. These effects and props are recycled from the previous ride that inhabited the space, Earthquake: The Big One, with some new effects added in. Following the sequence, the train heads back to the West Oakland station, and the TV monitors on the train show the trailer for the faux film \\"Mutha Nature\\". The trailer, which spoofs disaster films in general, stars an uncredited Dwayne Johnson as a park ranger who tries to save lives during a series of ecological disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes. Green screen technology allows the trailer to incorporate scenes shot by guests, under the guidance of Universal Orlando staff. Cast *Christopher Walken as Frank Kincaid The owner, CEO, Head Director, Writer, Producer etc. of Disaster! Studios. When an accident on the set of his newest film Mutha Nature causes its stars to go to rehab, Kincaid casts park guests as his new actors. Alec Baldwin was originally considered for the role of Frank Kincaid. *Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson as the Star of Mutha Nature Although given no official character name, Johnson is seen as a lead role in Mutha Nature where he plays a park ranger who must save the world from hordes of disasters caused by an evil corporation. *Universal Studios Florida Entertainment Team Member as Lonnie, Kincaid's Assistant Director. When all of Kincaid's actors get sent to rehab during the filming of Mutha Nature, Lonnie is sent by Kincaid to cast new actors for his film. Lonnie is the main host of the attraction's pre-show. *Universal Studios Florida Operations Team Members as Production Crew Members the employees who work at Disaster! Studios for Kincaid. They are seen in almost every part of the attraction. *Matthew Walker as Mikey Kincaid's second unit assistant director for Mutha Nature. Mikey is seen twice in the entirety of the ride; in the second pre-show room working as a projectionist in a projectionists booth, and throughout the main ride portion. Mikey is the main host of the ride. Walker had previously worked on another Universal Studios-related project, Child's Play 3. Technology Theming outside the ride Disaster! uses Musion Eyeliner technology for the Frank Kincaid character. This technology uses techniques similar to the Pepper's Ghost effect that has been used in attractions such as Haunted Mansion and The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror at Walt Disney World Resort, as well as Universal's own Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey at Islands of Adventure. Musion projects a high definition image onto the floor and onto a giant piece of acrylic glass, giving it the illusion that it is lifelike. It also gives the ability to interact with objects on stage, as can be seen in many parts of the attraction. Disaster! also uses real-time editing to help produce the movie trailer for Mutha Nature that is shown at the end of the ride. Real-time editing captures shots and wirelessly transmits them onto the Disaster! ride vehicle, which then inserts those shots into the trailer.

The 10 mm Auto cartridge has functioned as the parent case for the 9√ó25mm Super Auto G, which is essentially a necked-down version of the 10 mm Auto. The 10 mm Auto cartridge case was used for this since it has the capability to operate with relative high chamber pressures for its case capacity which, combined with smaller and hence lighter bullets result in very high muzzle velocities. History The cartridge got C.I.P. (Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes √† Feu Portatives) certified in 1991. The 9√ó25mm Super Auto G is currently (2009) not commercially available and exists only as a C.I.P. datasheet. It might however still used by a few shooters who produce the cases from 10 mm Auto brass by reshaping the shoulder and neck, and handloading it with 9 mm calibre bullets.

Americans would define the shoulder angle at alpha/2 ‚âà 19.9 degrees. The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 250 mm (1 in 9.84 in), 6 grooves, √ò lands = 8.82 mm, √ò grooves = 9.02 mm, land width = 2.49 mm and the primer type is large pistol. According to the official C.I.P. (Commission Internationale Permanente Pour L'Epreuve Des Armes A Feu Portative) guidelines the 9√ó25mm Super Auto G case can handle up to 255 MPa (36,985 psi) piezo pressure. In C.I.P. regulated countries every pistol cartridge combo has to be proofed at 130% of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers. The American 9√ó25mm Dillon pistol wildcat cartridge is probably the closest ballistic twin of the 9√ó25mm Super Auto G.

The goal of this project is a roadmap leading from the R&D; environment to mastering nano-electronics and nano-photonics technologies at an industrial scale. _European MONA project publishes roadmap for photonics and nanotechnologies Small Times, 4 February 2008_ This roadmap has been completed and is available to the public. =Network for Exchange of Components Photonics Research : NEXPRESSO= Beginning in 2007, EPIC and its members initiated the ACCORD project which purchases prototype photonics components and systems from SMEs and awards them to university R&D; groups based on competitive proposals. NEXPRESSO follows ACCORD, (Advanced Components Cooperation for Optoelectronic Research and Development), an exchange initiative also developed by EPIC. =Leadership in Fiber Laser Technologies: LIFT= EPIC organised and led a consortium of 20 companies, SMEs, and research labs in a proposal to the European Commission for a ‚Ç¨17 million project to develop new technologies for higher brilliance fiber lasers. The project has been accepted and started in 2009. EPIC also initiated and manages the Linked-In site for Fiber Lasers.Fiber Laser FaserLaser =Workshops on key photonics opportunities= EPIC organises workshops and symposia on key topics and opportunities identified by its membership. Proceedings and synthesis of these meetings are available to the public.

Early years Born on New Year's Day 1916, Mary Emajen Lapinska was the first child of Dr. Lawrence Weill Lapinska, a successful dentist, and Mrs. Mary Edythe Lapinska. Fink's younger sister, Betty Mae, was born in 1919. Fink described her childhood as being happy, though not perfect. She confided in her journal that her parents argued frequently. She also wrote about her desire to win the approval of her mother: Faith was an important aspect of Fink's life. She and her family attended the Indianapolis Hebrew Congregation. Even at an early age, Fink felt strongly about the reverence of going to Temple. On Rosh Hashanah 1934, Fink wrote in her journal \\"Granny was mad because I would not go [to Temple]. It is funny but I really don't care about going to Temple only as a place to go to show off one's new clothes.\\" Education Fink graduated from Shortridge High School in the spring of 1934. After high school, she went on to take courses at Indiana Business College and later attended Westminster College. As a young woman, Fink enjoyed going to dances and attending other social events. She met Lou Fink in March 1935 and the two began dating exclusively shortly thereafter. Mary became Mrs. Louis Fink on July 16, 1937. Louis later owned and operated the Concession Equipment & Supply Company.\\"A Tribute to Mrs. Louis Fink.\\" Indiana Jewish Chronicle. February 27, 1970. Family The Finks had one child together, a daughter named Lee Ann, born April 8, 1947. Lee Ann graduated from Broad Ripple High School in 1965. She went on to Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois, where she majored in secondary English education. There Lee Ann met and fell in love with David Runkle. The two were married on June 2, 1974.Fink, Mary. \\"Family Tree.\\" 1977. Community service Fink took an interest in her community early on, but it was not until after the birth of her daughter that she became a full-time volunteer. Over the span of her life, Fink dedicated more than 50 years to volunteer service and social activism. On those rare occasions when Fink was not volunteering, she enjoyed working in her garden and playing bridge.\\"Mary Fink Chosen Woman of the Year.\\" Menorah. May 1976. She died on March 29, 2000 at the age of 84. Volunteer work Fink described herself as a \\"professional volunteer.\\" She was deeply committed to supporting causes that helped build the Jewish community and promoted an atmosphere of social justice. One of the primary organizations Fink was involved with was the Indianapolis Section of the National Council of Jewish Women Inc. She served as president of the organization from 1962 to 1964.\\"Bouquet of Week ‚Äì Mrs. Louis.\\" The Jewish Post. May 11, 1973. Even after her presidency, Fink was deeply involved in the Council. She headed the NCJW Thrift Shop for many years. This was a tremendous responsibility, as the thrift shop is the organization's only means of income.\\"Mary Fink Heads JWF Year-Around Women's Division.\\" The JWF Report. August 1966. In later years, Fink worked as a historian with the council. Opportunity One of the most extraordinary opportunities of Fink's life came when she was invited to travel to Washington D. C. in 1968 as part of a NCJW delegation of 300 women from across the country. Fink was one of just four women selected to represent the state of Indiana. On the first day of their three-day trip, the women were briefed on a number of legislative issues, including education and social welfare, by a committee of congressmen ‚Äì including Indiana's own, Senator Birch Bayh. The women also attended a gala tea and luncheon given by first lady, Mrs. Claudia Lady Bird Johnson, which was also attended by a number of \\"Cabinet wives\\" and other prominent women. Mrs. Johnson made sure to speak to each of the 300 women individually over the course of the event. The highlight of the afternoon was an address by Senator Robert F. Kennedy. Fink told a correspondent for the Indiana Jewish Post: > I was impressed with our meeting in general ‚Äì but especially with the high > caliber of women who attended from all over the country. It was a wonderful > opportunity to be briefed in the current issues of which Council is > interested and be on the Hill and speak to our legislators and either enlist > their help or make them conscious of the issues the Council stands > for.Feldman, Trude. \\"Letter from Washington.\\" Indiana Jewish Post. March 8, > 1968. Religion Fink was also very involved with the Jewish Welfare Federation. She was elected as president of the Women's Division of the organization in 1969. Fink was also very instrumental in the creation of the Indiana Jewish Historical Society. She even served as president of the organization in its early years. The JWF Report referred to her as \\"one of our community's most committed and dedicated workers\\" in their April 1973 issue.\\"Mary Fink Honored with Cook Memorial Award.\\" The JWF Report.

Their name is a reference to the 1965 noir classic Alphaville; Alpha 60 being the computer controlling Godard's dystopian city. On March 1, 2012 they released their first full-length album The Rock, the Vulture and the Chain. History The band formed in early 2008 after some of the band's current members started getting tired of just playing garage venues. After a few months of rehearsing, a steady buzz spreading through their home town, and after the joining of keyboard player Martin Nordkvist, they released the Melting Tracks EP. Having received some radio air play, the summer had them doing some Swedish festivals. \\"Armour\\", the first music video from the band, was released on YouTube on January 16, 2012. It was directed by John R. Hallstr√∂m. On March 1, 2012 they released the band's first full-length album The Rock, the Vulture and the Chain, as well as a book of art in which artists have made interpretations of the band's songs. Sound The band's experimental approach has led commentators to draw attention to different musical influences. Some cite the classic guitar riff styles and fascination for oriental scales and modes developed by bands like Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin and the vocal expressiveness and majestic piano arrangements of Queen as the main influences, while others focus on the energy and attitude of the modern britpop movement, the danceful rhythms and lust for experimentation of electronic music. Lyrical themes Leonidas Aretakis has himself cited a few lyrical references, amongst others some figures in the Romantic and Neo- romantic movements, such as Friedrich H√∂lderlin, William Blake, Lord Byron, Rainer Maria Rilke and Georg Trakl, and the sometimes dreamlike storytelling of H.P. Lovecraft and Jorge Luis Borges. The use of mythological and literary references are common traits in the lyrics, which sometimes can be construed as dark, almost melancholic. Even though the meaning can be seen as quite opaque at times, some recurring themes include homelessness, social discontent and the search for hope in a fragmented world in the demise of \\"real\\" politics.

The neighborhood stretches from the Harsimus Stem Embankment (the Sixth Street Embankment) on the north to Christopher Columbus Drive on the south between Coles Street and Grove Street or more broadly, to Marin Boulevard. It borders the neighborhoods of Hamilton Park to the north, Van Vorst Park to the south, the Village to the west, and the Powerhouse Arts District to the east. Newark Avenue has traditionally been its main street. The name is from the Lenape, used by the Hackensack Indians who inhabited the region and could be translated as Crow‚Äôs Marsh. From many years, the neighborhood was part of the \\"Horseshoe\\", a political delineation created by its position between the converging rail lines and political gerrymandering. Early settlement Harsimus is a derivative of a Lenape phrase, possibly meaning Crow's Marsh. Spellings include: Aharsimus, Ahasimus, Hasymes, Haassemus, Hahassemes, Hasimus, Horseemes, Hasseme, Horsimus In current Lenape, ahas means \\"crow\\". 1664 Duke's Plan showing settlements at Harsimus and Communipaw at time of the surrender of Fort Amsterdam In 1629, the Dutchman Michael Reyniersz Pauw obtained a patent for all the land in what would become Hudson County, naming it Pavonia. Unable to fulfill a patroon charter provision that he set up a plantation with fifty permanent settlers, the Dutch West India Company sold a part to his superintendent, who had built a homestead in 1634 and was the first of many Van Vorsts to play important roles in the development of the city. A family homestead built in 1647 was demolished in 1967. Conflict with Native Americans compromised the settlement 1643, which continued to grow after the 1645 treaty ending Kieft's War. Again in 1655, the area was attacked in a conflict called the Peach Tree War. In 1660, it came under the jurisdiction of Bergen, New Netherland the main village of which was located at Bergen Square.*Harsimus Cove history alt=Stone church building Busy port city, 1882 Once the area was ceded to the British after the surrender of Fort Amsterdam, New York claimed ownership to the high waterline along the west bank of the Hudson River and that any pier built there was under its jurisdiction, thus stifling development which would compete with the burgeoning New York City. Paulus Hook was the first to urbanize, and The City of Jersey was incorporated in various forms in 1820, 1829, and again in 1838.\\"The Story of New Jersey's Civil Boundaries: 1606-1968\\", John P. Snyder, Bureau of Geology and Topography; Trenton, New Jersey; 1969. p. 146‚Äì147. John Coles, a merchant from New York, was among the first to expand into Harsimus.*Hamilton Park History The Supreme Court settled the matter of jurisdiction in the 1830s, creating a border mid-river. Harsimus grew with shipping along shoreline and residences farther inland. The short-lived Van Vorst Township later merged with its neighbor. Much of the housing stock from the maritime era is still intact. Many of the streets in the gridiron laid at the time have been renamed over the years. Moving away from the river they were originally called Hudson, River, Kelso, and Barnum. Provost and others to the west have stayed the same.Hopkins, G.M. Combined Atlas of the State of New Jersey and the County of Hudson, 1873 Rise of the railroad and Hague PRR lines. PAD is in its southeast corner. Harsimus was transformed by the development of the railroad industry.Short history of Harsimus Cove By 1870 much of the estuary flood zone was land-filled for the development of railyards, extending a quarter mile from Henderson Street. Three elevated right of ways were built: one from the Bergen Arches to the Erie Railroad Pavonia Terminal,Jersey City Past and Present: Erie Railroad Terminal the Harsimus Stem Embankment at 6th Street for the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), and another for its Jersey City Branch along Railroad Avenue (now Columbus Drive) to Exchange Place. The embankments and elevated lines separated adjoining neighborhoods. A small slip was created and still is called Harsimus Cove. Huge stockyards dominated the waterfront between the train terminals. Harsimus' isolation was codified with gerrymandering, forming a horseshoe and creating a new nickname. The community consisted of Catholic immigrants, many of them Irish, who worked on the railroad. Infuxes of Ellis Island immigrants swelled the population. A vestige of the Slavic character of the area remains at the Ukrainian National Home. To diminish the Democratic power base, Republican power brokers redrew the voting district to consist solely of the Horseshoe so that they may protect other seats from Democratic threat. In the 1910s the Horseshoe power base produced the infamous Mayor Frank Hague who dominated the Hudson County political machine and influenced city, county, state, and federal politics for most of the first half of the 20th century. In 1941 a large fire struck the Horsehoe waterfront. Post industrial era In the late 1950s, container shipping in Port Newark supplanted railroad ports along waterfront, which by the 1970s were abandoned, leading to a decline in population and economic activity. Urban renewal projects brought slum clearance of tenements along Grove Street as well as the removal of the PRR elevated rail right of way. Middle, low income, and senior housing projects were developed. A section of Grove Street was renamed Manila Avenue in recognition of the city's resident Overseas Filipinos. Henderson Street became Marin Boulevard for the first governor of Puerto Rico Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n to reflect the influx of Puerto Rican and Filipino residents. Railroad Avenue is now Columbus Drive, acknowledging the still large Italian population. The renewal did not affect the 19th century blocks which were not demolished. A historic preservation movement and real estate reinvestment led to Harsimus's designation as a Historic District in 1987. Convenience to mass transit and relatively affordable rents attracted an artistic community, some of whom converted buildings to live/work spaces. Zoning in the form of \\"WALDO\\" (or Work and Live District Overlay) were unsuccessful in preserving and stimulating the creation of an arts district within the area where large warehouses still remained, and have given way the Powerhouse Arts District and the construction of residential highrises. East of the neighborhood, the LeFrak Organization obtained title to most of the disused Erie-Lackawanna land and began the development of Newport, centered around the Port Authority Trans Hudson (PATH) Newport Station in the 1980s. To the south, the PRR abattoir were also acquired. Development plans did not include extending the 19th century urban grid to the waterfront, but the construction of large parking decks at the former and strip mall at the latter. The first segment of the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail opened in 2002, including the Harsimus Cove Station nearby the landmark Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Powerhouse. Grove Pointe, a residential conmplex at 100 and 102 Christopher Columbus Drive, the \\"30-story tiered brick-and-stone structure with abundant glass\\" was designed by DeWitt Tishman Architectsand built by Kushner Real Estate Group.

It is a CISC microcontroller. A slightly extended variant of the 68HC08, it shares upward compatibility with the aging 68HC05 microcontrollers, and is found in almost any type of embedded systems. The larger members offer up to 128 KiB of flash, and 8 KiB of RAM via a simple MMU which allows bank-switching 16 KiB of the address space and an address/data register pair which allows data fetches from any address. The paging scheme used allows for a theoretical maximum of 4MB of flash. MMU equipped variants offer two extra CPU instructions, CALL and RTC, which are used instead of JSR and RTS respectively when dealing with subroutines placed in paged memory, allowing direct page-to-page subroutine calls. In a single atomic operation, CALL saves and RTC restores not only the PC but also one extra address byte, the PPAGE (program page) byte. Because of this extra byte, and to also keep the stack balanced, a subroutine ending with RTC must always be called with CALL, even if it resides in the same memory page. Internally, the 9S08 instruction set is upward compatible with the 6805, with the addition of stack indexed addressing modes. (Instructions using the SP register have opcodes prefixed with the byte 0x9E). It has a single eight- bit accumulator, A, one sixteen-bit index register, HX (whose lower half, X, is used in isolation by 6805-compatible instructions), a condition code register, a 16-bit stack pointer, and a program counter. For compatibility with the 6805 which does not have an H register, the most significant byte of the HX register, H, is cleared during reset, and H is the only register not stacked automatically when entering any ISR (Interrupt Service Routine). Unlike the 6805, the stack can be placed anywhere in memory using appropriate instructions. The standard method of programming or debugging the 9S08 family is via a standard 6-pin BDM interface (only one pin is used for communication with the microcontroller). A wide variety of peripherals is available for different members and/or packages. SCI, SPI, 8/10/12-bit A/D, (C)PWM, Input Captures, and Output Compares are common with most members, but no external bus is available. Some members come with a built-in CAN controller.  Compiler support  The S08 is partly supported (e.g., no MMU support) by the free C compiler SDCC and fully by CodeWarrior.

He attended Columbia University, where he studied architecture.Heller, Steven . \\"Oliver Lincoln Lundquist, Designer, Is Dead at 92 \\", The New York Times, January 4, 2009. Accessed January 4, 2009. =Industrial design and military service= He was hired by Raymond Loewy's industrial design firm in 1937 while he was a senior at Columbia, and was trained by the well-known architect himself. For the 1939 New York World's Fair, Lundquist was part of a team that developed a wind tunnel effect showing smoke traveling over a Chrysler Air Flow car for that company's pavilion at the fair. He created a \\"magic talking car\\" that spoke about Chrysler's car with the voice of the host of Major Bowes Amateur Hour. He created a \\"frozen forest\\" of steel palm trees with refrigerant inside to demonstrate Chrysler's automotive air conditioning system. At the Loewy firm, he developed the blue-and-white Q-Tip box, described by The New York Times as \\"one of the most widely known of product packages\\". Lundquist worked with Eero Saarinen at the Office of Strategic Services during World War II. Saarinen and Lundquist won a Post War Living housing competition sponsored by Arts & Architecture for a house they had jointly designed. Lundquist was a pioneer for track lighting and created designs for the lighting company Lightolier. Lundquist served as a lieutenant in the United States Navy during World War II in the Office of Strategic Services, where he prepared visual presentations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Washington press corps, working together with Alger Hiss and Saarinen. =United Nations and its logo= Flag of the United Nations Following his military service, Lundquist attended the United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco, California. The organizers of the 1945 conference wanted an insignia that could be made into a pin to identify delegates. United States Secretary of State Edward Stettinius, Jr. was chairman of the U.S. delegation, and realized that a temporary design might become the permanent symbol of the United Nations. He formed a committee headed by Lundquist that developed a design consisting of a world map surrounded by leaves from a design created by Donal McLaughlin.Bertram, Hulen. \\"Origin of the UNO Seal\\", The New York Times, March 10, 1946.

The blue color that appears in the background of the insignia was chosen to be \\"the opposite of red, the war color\\". The original color the group chose in 1945 was a gray blue that differs from the current United Nations flag. The globe used in the original design was an azimuthal projection focused on the North Pole with North America and the United States, the host nation of the conference, at the bottom center. The projection used cut off portions of the Southern Hemisphere at the latitude of Argentina which was acceptable as Argentina was not then a member of the United Nations. The final design used in the modern logo includes all of South America and Antarctica and was rotated 90 degrees to place Europe at the bottom center. As special services officer for the United Nations, Lundquist announced in June 1946 that the organization would use the charting and diagramming techniques that had been used successfully by the United States Armed Forces to present information internally and for public use. The division would also be responsible for the planning of the UN's temporary offices in Lake Success, New York, including design of buttons, passes, letterhead and license plates.Staff. \\"U.N.

Identification and name John Strong Newberry, director of the Ohio State Geological Survey, first identified the formation in 1870. He called it the \\"Bedford Shale\\" and designated its type locality at Tinkers Creek near Bedford, Ohio. Details of the type locality and of stratigraphic nomenclature for this unit as used by the U.S. Geological Survey are available on-line at the National Geologic Map Database.https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Geolex/search The Bedford Shale in northern Ohio is a red, predominantly soft clay shale that grades to grayish-black near its base. Siltstone beds, showing ripples and some as much as thick, are interbedded near the bottom. This red Bedford Shale consists mostly of sandstone and siltstone, and is much more argillaceous from mid-state Franklin County north-northeast to Lorain County on Lake Erie. Proceeding east from Lorain County, the silt content increases. The Bedford undergoes a marked lithologic change at the Cuyahoga River. It becomes equal parts red and gray shale, and the basal becomes a hard siltstone (the Euclid member, or Euclid siltstone). At Tinkers Creek in Bedford, Ohio, there is no red shale; instead there is about of gray and bluish-gray shale, nodules of light-gray mudstone, and brownish-gray to gray irregular beds of siltstone. East of the Grand River, the clay shale is largely replaced by silty gray shale, hard silty gray mudstone, and thin platy gray siltstone. The red shale fades in intensity and thickness toward the south. South of Columbus, the color fades to reddish-brown and exists only as a bed a few feet thick between bluish or bluish-gray Bedford Shale. The Bedford in southern Ohio is almost completely a bluish-gray shale. Proceeding south from Ross and Pike counties, the Bedford turns from a soft clay shale to a gray silty shale interbedded with thin beds of gray siltstone in its upper parts. In Ross, Pike, and Scioto counties, siltstone in the Bedford increases so much that it becomes mostly siltstone interbedded with silty shale. Generally, the red Bedford thins and grades into the gray Bedford all along its margin. Along the rough line from Huron to Lawrence counties, beds of mudrock may be found. Throughout Ohio, a few thin layers of siltstone may be found in all types of Bedford Shale. These are calcareous and thick in central Ohio. Siltstone beds increase in number and thickness in the upper part of the Bedford shale south of Columbus. In southern Ross County, the upper third of the Bedford contains a large number of layers of thin, platy siltstone as well as occasional thin layers consisting of blebs of calcium carbonate, marcasite, and pyrite. Oscillation ripple marks can be seen on the upper surfaces of these siltstones. Silty laminae become common toward the bottom of the Bedford Shale throughout the state, as do thin beds of gray silty mudstone (a fine-grained type of mudrock). \\"Flow rolls\\" are a structure which appears unique to the Bedford Shale. These structures appear in the basal part of the formation. In a flow roll, the rock is greatly deformed and rolled into a cylindrical shape. The Bedford Shale of Michigan is a light gray or bluish-light gray in color. It is a silty shale, siltier and sandier in its upper part. The boundary with the Berea Sandstone exhibits thin veins (\\"stringers\\") of sandstone, indicating erosion of the Bedford Shale which was filled in later by sand. The Bedford Shale appears gray or greenish-gray in Kentucky, and contains sparse to abundant thin beds of siltstone, calcareous concretions, and nodules of pyrite. Limited areas of red Bedford Shale can be found in Boyd County. Siltstone and sandstone beds are particularly common from Lewis and Greenup counties southeast to Pike County; here, the Bedford is referred to as the \\"Berea sand\\". Geographic Extent The Bedford Shale is a shale geologic formation in the states of Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and Virginia in the United States. =Ohio= Map showing general location of the Bedford Shale in Ohio, northeastern Kentucky, and western Pennsylvania. The Bedford Shale in Ohio has been extensively studied since 1943, and the 1954 study by Pepper, de Witt, and Demarest was still considered the classic study of the formation as late as 1991. The Bedford Shale is present throughout much of Ohio.Ryder, R.T., Crangle, R.D., Jr., Trippi, M.H., Swezey, C.S., Lentz, E.E., Rowan, E.L., and Hope, R.S., 2009, Geologic cross section D-D‚Äô through the central Appalachian basin from the Findlay arch, Sandusky County, Ohio, to the Valley and Ridge province, Hardy County, West Virginia: U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Map SIM-3067, 2 sheets with 52-page pamphlet. http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sim3067 Ryder, R.T., Trippi, M.H., Swezey, C.S., Crangle, R.D., Jr., Hope, R.S., Rowan, E.L., and Lentz, E.E., 2012, Geologic cross section C-C‚Äô through the central Appalachian basin from near the Findlay Arch, north-central Ohio, to the Valley and Ridge Province, Bedford County, south-central Pennsylvania: U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Map SIM-3172, 2 sheets with 70-page pamphlet. http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sim3172 Outcrops extend along Lake Erie from the Ohio-Pennsylvania border west to Lorain County. It runs in a generally southern direction to Lawrence County in the south. The southern border of Ohio along the Ohio River defines its southernmost boundary in the state. In eastern Meigs County, the boundary turns north and runs to north- central Athens County before turning northeast to run through western Washington County into Monroe County. It runs north through the center of Belmont and Jefferson counties, and in southern Columbiana County turns east to pass into Pennsylvania. On average, the Bedford Shale in Ohio is to thick, reaching its maximum thickness between Huron and Lawrence counties. The shale is about thick along its central ridge between Lorain and Licking counties. In northern Ohio, the thickness of the Bedford is irregular due to erosion prior to the deposit of the Berea Sandstone, and due to recent glacial and stream erosion. The Bedford thins toward the south; near Columbus in central Ohio it is thick, and near Chillicothe to the south. It thins to the east as well, reaching near Bedford and in southwestern Ashtabula County. Outcrops of the Bedford shale may be found throughout Cuyahoga, Lake, and Geauga counties in cliffs beneath the Berea sandstone. Outcrops are much fewer in Lorain County (west of Cuyahoga County). The Bedford appears only in deep valleys (such as those of rivers and large streams). The red shale weathers so swiftly into a sticky red mud that even these outcrops are usually covered by soil. South of the counties bordering Lake Erie, outcrops are usually covered by glacial drift. Occasional outcrops can be seen along streams that flow south into the Ohio River, particularly at Big Walnut Creek. =Michigan= Eastern North America in the Middle Devonian, showing the Michigan Basin of the Rheic Ocean. In Michigan, the Bedford Shale is found in the southeast along shores of Lake Erie and Lake St. Clair; along the shore of Lake Huron north of Saginaw Bay; along the south shore of the Straits of Mackinac; north of 44 degrees latitude along the shore of Lake Michigan; and in the far southwest corner of the state. The Bedford Shale was first identified in Michigan in 1876 in the southeastern part of the state. Some sources say the shale is thick while others say it is generally about thick. It is almost thick in The Thumb of Michigan, and about thick in Southeast Michigan. The Bedford Shale becomes finer-grained and thins from Lake Erie/Lake St. Clair to the west, pinching out to extinction near the center of the Michigan Basin and merging with the upper part of the Ellsworth Shale. In south-central Michigan, the Bedford Shale grades into and intertongues with the Antrim Shale. There are no known outcrops of the Bedford Shale in Michigan, as it and the rocks above it are covered by Pleistocene glacial drift. =Kentucky= The Bedford Shale is present throughout much of eastern Kentucky.Ryder, R.T., Trippi, M.H., and Swezey, C.S., 2015, Geologic cross section I-I‚Äô through the central Appalachian basin from north-central Kentucky to southwestern Virginia: U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Map SIM-3343, 2 sheets with two pamphlets (41p. and 102p.). http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/sim3343 It is thickest in north (in Lewis County), thinning out to extinction in Bath, Estill, and Pike counties as it proceeds south and west. It is about thick in Letcher and Pike counties, which were closest to the Famennian deltas being deposited from the east and southeast. The Bedford Shale essentially forms a great wedge underground, with the narrow edge in the southwest. The Bedford Shale in Kentucky is covered in thin soil and heavily weathered sandstone blocks. Outcrops of the rock may be seen along the Pine Mountain ridge in Harlan County. In Kentucky, a transition zone ranging from a few inches to in thickness occasionally appears as the basal member of the Bedford Shale. =Pennsylvania= Bedford Shale is found in Crawford County, Pennsylvania, where it is also known as \\"Hayfield limestone\\". It is extremely lenticular and highly localized, and gray to bluish-gray in color. It is frequently interbedded with ripple marked siltstone, and contains a few thin siliceous limestone layers. It overlays the Cussewago Sandstone and is overlain by the Berea Sandstone. The Bedford is feet at Littles Corners in Hayfield Township, and decreases to thick northwest of Meadville. It thins rapidly and loses its identity around Meadville, where it grades into the Shellhammer Hollow Formation. Fucoids in the shale can be seen on Stratton Creek. =West Virginia= The Bedford Shale has also been traced into West Virginia. It may be found in the subsurface along the Ohio River in Mason, Cabell, Wayne, and Mingo counties. Its edge cannot be readily determined, as the Bedford's gray shale and interbedded siltstones overlay extremely similar Early Famennian rocks. However, the Bedford Shale appears to pinch out in southern Mingo County. The Bedford Shale may exist in northern West Virginia, but had not been identified there as of 1979. =Virginia= Bedford Shale has also been identified in the Dickenson-Buchanan county area in southwestern Virginia. Stratigraphic Setting The Bedford Shale is the basal member of the Waverly Group, which (in ascending order) includes the Bedford Shale, Berea Sandstone, Sunbury Shale, Cuyahoga Formation, Logan Formation, and the Maxville Limestone. Generally, the Bedford Shale in Ohio is underlain by the Cleveland Shale throughout most of Ohio, although it is underlain by the Chagrin Shale in the east. The boundary with the Cleveland Shale is usually clear. However, a transition zone, ranging from a few inches to in thickness, occasionally appears. The transition zone is missing along most of the western edge of the red Bedford Shale in northern Ohio, and only at a few places are thin stringers of black shale found in the basal part of the Bedford. Above the transition layer, there is usually about of gray shale. This represents the basal part of the Bedford Shale. This gray shale thickens significantly east of Cuyahoga River, and to the south as the red shale pinches out. It is difficult to impossible to visually determine the boundary with the Chagrin Shale due to its lithologic similarity with the Bedford. In eastern Ashtabula and Trumbull counties, the Bedford overlays the Cussewago Sandstone. The Bedford Shale is generally overlaid by the Berea Sandstone throughout Ohio. The contact between the two is generally clear but extremely irregular. Pre- Berea and Berean erosion eroded significant portions of the red Bedford Shale in northern Ohio. For example, near Berea, Ohio, deep channels were scoured into the Bedford Shale. Sand filled these channels, and became Berea Sandstone. To the southwest, in Huron County, these channels cut down to the Cleveland Shale. Along Ohio's eastern border, in Columbiana, Mahoning, and Trumbull counties, erosion has almost completely removed the Bedford Shale. Erosional channeling becomes less marked toward the south-central Ohio. Near Columbus, the channels are only about deep, and they disappear south of Lithopolis (which is southeast of Columbus). In southern Ohio, the Bedford and Berea grade into one another so gradually that the boundary between them cannot be distinguished visually. The Bedford Shale in Michigan is generally overlaid by the Berea Sandstone. The upper part of Bedford in this state is silty and sandy, making the boundary between it and the Berea sandstone nearly impossible to identify visually. The boundary may be determined by gamma ray logging, however. In eastern Michigan, the Bedford Shale overlays the Antrim Shale. Toward the center of the Michigan Basin, the Bedford overlays the Ellsworth Shale. The boundary between the two becomes increasingly difficult to identify as one proceeds west, as the Bedford merges laterally into the upper of the Ellsworth Shale. In the vicinity of Irvine (Michigan), the black shale of the Sunbury comes in contact with the black shale of the Ohio shale as a result of the feathering out of the Berea and Bedford strata. Generally, the Bedford Shale in Kentucky is underlain by the Ohio Shale and overlaid by the Berea Sandstone. The Bedford Shale's upper and lower contacts are usually sharp in the state, but complicated by intense deformation. In much of eastern Kentucky, the Bedford Shale and Berea Sandstone intertongue (interlock). Near Vanceburg, the upper of the Bedford Shale is silty shale that comes between the Bedford and Berea siltstone. Only to the east near Garrison, Bedford is almost completely siltstone. Just south, near Petersville, the Bedford has almost no siltstone layer. There are only a few thin siltstone beds present, and the Bedford grades almost imperceptibly into the Berea‚Äîboth of which are composed of bluish-gray to gray clay shales and some gray silty shale. In southern Lewis County, there is no Bedford siltstone; the upper portion of the Bedford is a noticeably soft bluish-gray shale. Near Olympia in Bath County, the Berea Sandstone is not found and the Sunbury Shale overlies the Bedford, while near Irvine in Estill County to the south both the Berea and Bedford are missing and the Sunbury lies atop the Ohio Shale. Fossils Except for its lowest strata, the Bedford Shale is largely fossil-free. In central and north- central Ohio, the Bedford Shale contains extensive fossils in the first few feet of its bottommost part. These include brachiopods like Lingula, Orbiculoidea, and the large Syringothyris bedfordensis; molluscs, particularly bivalves; and Devonian fish. South of Ross County, most of the siltstones in the Bedford Shale show fucoids (casts of Fucales, a common littoral seaweed). The basal of the Bedford Shale in Michigan contains extensive fossils of the Famennian stage. Small amounts of natural gas have been recovered from the shale as well. In Kentucky, a transition zone ranging from a few inches to in thickness occasionally appears as the basal member of the Bedford Shale in Kentucky. Invertebrate fossils are found at the top of this transition zone in northeast Kentucky. Age Although there have been conflicting reports in the past, the most recent evidence is that the rock was laid down very late in the Famennian stage of the Devonian period. This makes the rock about 365 to 358.9 million years old. The age of the Bedford Shale has seen significantly different interpretations over time. Some geologists have placed it exclusively in the upper Devonian while others have concluded it is exclusively lower Carboniferous. Still others have placed the Devonian- Carboniferous boundary in the basal few inches or feet of the Bedford Shale. Depending on the source, the rock began to be laid down either 360 million years ago or 365 million years ago. and finished being laid down at the end of the Famennian 358.9 million years ago. In their 1991 review of the literature, geologists Raymond C. Gutschick and Charles A. Sandberg point out that the Bedford Shale is correctly assigned to the upper Devonian. The 1975 Devonian- Carboniferous Boundary Working Group of the International Union of Geological Sciences engaged in an extensive study of brachiopod, conodont, and spore fossils in the Bedford Shale and Berea Sandstone, and found no evidence of lower Mississippian conodonts in either rock formation. The American definition of the Devonian period was realigned to match the definition already in use in Europe, which led to the placement of both formations in the Famennian stage of the upper Devonian. Interpretation of Depositional Environment The Bedford Shale was laid down by several river deltas. One delta laid down this rock formation in Michigan's Thumb peninsula. Several small deltas deposited Bedford Shale in Kentucky. A particularly large delta, known as the Red Bedford Delta, laid down a red-colored wedge of the shale in central Ohio. The climate of the late Famennian was mild, and much plant life grew along streams and rivers. There was abundant precipitation, and monsoons swept the area from west to east. During the Famennian stage of the late Devonian period, the Rheic Ocean covered much of what is now Kentucky, Michigan, and Ohio in the United States. This sea became extremely cloudy and turned anoxic (oxygen-poor) during the Hangenberg event, a global extinction that marked the end of the Devonian period and which deposited large amounts of erosion sediment and organic material into the sea. After the Hangenberg event ended, the waters of the Rheic Ocean began to clear and oxygenate again. The end of the Hangenberg event coincided with the end of the Acadian orogeny, a highly active period of mountain-building that began in the middle Devonian and created the Acadian Mountains which covered the Mid-Atlantic region, New England, and the Canadian Maritimes. As sea levels fell, the Canadian Shield and the Acadian Mountains began to erode. Material from these areas created river deltas that pushed south and west into the sea, creating the Bedford Shale and Berea Sandstone. A sketch map of the paleo Ontario River system The Ohio Bay of the Rheic Ocean covered most of Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and western Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. At the start of the period during which the Bedford Shale began to be laid, muddy waters of the bay began to clear. The land adjacent to the north and east rose, furnishing coarser detrital material. Stronger currents stirred up the mud, which mixed with the coarse sediment and became the basal part of the Bedford Shale. The stronger current oxygenated the water, and small mollusks and fish repopulated the bay. Greater amounts of sediment flowing into the bay made it inhospitable for life again. The shallow sea kept rising, reaching its maximum depth when about half the Bedford Shale had been deposited. The sea rose and fell repeatedly while the remainder of the Bedford was deposited. The ancient Ontario River probably entered the Ohio Bay about Lorain County, depositing red sediment which originated in the eastern part of the Canadian Shield. This created the Red Bedford Delta which deposited the sediment that became the red Bedford Shale of north-central and northeast Ohio. In time, the Red Bedford Delta extended about south into the Ohio Bay, nearly dividing it. The pre-erosion delta was roughly wide at its northern end, wide in the middle, and about wide at its southern end. Two lobes, each about wide, extended from the southern tip. Oscillation ripple marks in the siltstone of the Bedford Shale's gray basal part shows that this sediment was deposited under water. These ripple marks are not present in the red Bedford Shale, indicating it was deposited subaerially. There is also a well-documented system of about of ancient braided and meandering water channels in Ashland, Holmes, and Knox counties, indicating where the distributary network of the river sought to reach the sea. The Cincinnati Arch and its branches, the Findlay Arch and the Kankakee Arch, probably prevented the red sediment from reaching westward. This vast arc of rock, which extends from western Alabama and northern Mississippi northeast to north-central Ohio, was probably a low-lying island near Cincinnati, Ohio, when the Bedford Shale first began to be laid down. It not only rose over the next several million years, it accreted sediment to it‚Äîperhaps extending almost to the northern shore of the Ohio Bay. The ancient Gay-Fink River, Cabin Creek River, and Virginia-Carolinas River also formed large deltas in the eastern part of the Ohio Bay, contributing gray sedimentary material to the Bedford Shale from what is now Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. As much as one-fifth of the total area of the Bedford Shale was created from these deltas. A number of sandbars, collectively known as the Channel Sands, existed on either side of what later became the Red Bedford Delta. These irregularly shaped bodies continue to exist within the Bedford Shale. One such narrow, sinuous, branching body exists in a line from Richland County south to Hocking County. Smaller sand bodies exist in Ames Township in Athens County, Reading Township in Perry County, and a few other places. These sand bodies all lie beneath the red shale, indicating they were laid down early in the Bedford Shale's depositional history. Two large siltstone lentils were created during the deposition of the Bedford Shale, the northern Sagamore and the southern Euclid. The Sagamore, which has a maximum thickness of , is found on Sagamore Creek in southeastern Cuyahoga County, and is in the lower third of the Bedford Shale. The Euclid, which has a maximum thickness of , extends from Independence, Ohio northeast to Willoughby, Ohio, and is part of the most basal member of the Bedford Shale. An extremely large sandstone lens is the Second Berea. Located in Athens, Gallia, Meigs, Morgan, and Muskingum counties, this sandstone body is long and wide. Originally known as the \\"stray gas sand\\", it was originally a large sandbar east of what became the Red Bedford Delta. It is equivalent in age to the Euclid siltstone. About of gray Bedford Shale overlays the Second Berea. As in other states, the Bedford Shale in Michigan was deposited by deltas. Relatively coarse clastic material eroded from the Canadian Shield was carried by the ancient Ontario River System south into the Michigan Basin of the Rheic Ocean. There, the sediment was deposited to the south and west by the Thumb Delta, a large delta which at that time covered The Thumb of Michigan. There is good evidence to suggest that Bedford Shale in Michigan was not laid down contemporaneously with the red Bedford Shale in Ohio, and most likely came shortly after. Although the Michigan Basin and the Appalachian Basin were connected, later tectonic uplift created the Findlay Arch. As younger rock atop the arch eroded, a gap was created between the Bedford Shale of Ohio and the Bedford Shale of Michigan. As in other states, the Bedford Shale in Kentucky was formed by deltas. The shale exhibits cross-bedding and erosional channels filled with Berea Sandstone, both of which indicate that the Rheic Sea was shallow. Three ancient rivers‚Äîthe Gay- Fink, the Cabin Creek, and the Virginia-Carolina‚Äîprobably deposited most of the sediment, which consisted of detrital rock and organic matter from the Acadian Mountains flowing westward and southward into the shallow sea covering the Appalachian Basin. Evidence for a westerly and southwesterly flow of water comes from channels eroded in the shale and filled with sandstone. These lobes extend southwest, indicating the direction of the flow of water. Ripple marks in the Bedford Shale in Kentucky form in a northwest-southeast line, indicating a steady wind coming from the northeast. Economic Resources Native Americans used heavily weathered Bedford Shale for its reddish pigment. Colonial French traders named Vermillion River after the Bedford's red shale. Weathered Bedford Shale was also used in the 1800s and early 1900s to make face brick (a brick used on exterior surfaces to present a clean appearance) and tile.

Career  Luc Deleu is a Belgian architect and urban planner residing in Antwerp. In 1969 he completed his architectural degree, creating T.O.P. office in 1970 to question the role of architecture and urbanism in the modern age. His utopian projects put emphasis on mobility instead of the immobility of real estate, focusing on using urban space in a more efficient and intensive manner. In 1980 he created the Orban Planning Manifesto, which for the first time, places emphasis on the responsibilities of architecture and building on a global scale. Notable projects include: Proposal to use existing rockets to fire (nuclear) waste at the sun (1975), School of Perspective and the Station Europa Centraal (1988-1989), VIP City (1999-2004). In 2006 a new work called Urban Space insists on increasing population density without trying to define functions. Since 2000, the work of Luc Deleu is more and more exhibited in contemporary art context.

Benton High School is a member of the Benton School District. History In 1885, a public referendum established the Benton School District within the county-wide system. In Saline County in 1889, there were about 4,700 students, 62 teachers, and 50 public schools. In addition, there were several private schools in the county. After 1900, smaller neighboring school districts were consolidated with the Benton District, making it possible to have a larger and better teaching force, improved equipment, and longer terms. However, it was not until the 1920s that children were required to attend school. Starting in 1928, rural children that did not have access to high school courses were allowed to transfer to Benton High and were not charged tuition. The Great Depression of the 1930s created a financial crisis in education, causing Benton school teachers to work for several years at almost half pay. In 1930, Hill‚Äôs Business College of Little Rock was established at Benton High School, where citizens of Saline County could take night classes. School enrollment grew during and after World War II.

Career Summary Bobby Walthour started his career as a sprinter and developed into a formidable six-day rider, but achieved his greatest fame as a fearless motor-pacer. Walthour turned professional in 1896. He won America‚Äôs greatest race, the six-day race inside Madison Square Garden, with his partner, Canadian Archie McEachern, in 1901. Walthour again won at the Garden in 1903 with fellow American southerner Bennie Munroe. In 1902 and 1903 Walthour won American motor-paced championships. Walthour won the motor-pacing World Championships in 1904 in London and in 1905 in Brussels. Walthour‚Äôs cycling career continued until the early 1920s. Beginnings Walthour learned to ride a bike in the early 1890s just about the time when the safety bicycle, the one we are most familiar with today, replaced the cumbersome high-wheeled bicycle. Walthour became employed in Atlanta, Georgia as a bike messenger and showed a great aptitude on the bicycle. Walthour began his amateur career in 1895 in road races in and around Atlanta. Professional career Walthour quickly developed into a good professional sprinter, but was never good as the best in the game. However, with the development of the petroleum motorcycle, motor-pacing became as popular as, or more popular than sprinting. Motor-pacing was a fast, extremely hazardous occupation in which riders followed perilously close to their ‚Äúpacers‚Äù on motorcycles, drafting within the protection of their slipstream. Walthour gave up sprinting for motor-pacing completely in 1901. In the United States, Walthour raced indoors and outdoors on highly banked wooden surface or cement tracks. Many, like the track inside Madison Square Garden, were ten laps to the mile, but some were as big as five laps to the mile, such as the Charles River track in Boston. Cycle tracks dotted the east coast in cities such as Jacksonville, Atlanta, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Newark, New York City, Boston and Manchester and Walthour rode on them all. After several years of offers to ride in Europe, Walthour finally went in 1904. He arrived in Paris March as an underdog and left in May as L‚Äôimbattable Walthour (The Unbeatable Walthour). Walthour won 11 of 12 races, defeating the best in Europe. Amos G. Batchelder, chairman of the racing board of the National Cycling Association in the United States, received a cable from a high-ranking French official (probably Victor Breyer, the director of the Buffalo velodrome in Paris) indicating that Walthour was the ‚Äúbest ever seen in Europe and by far the best that has ever come from America, and is distinctly superior to all other riders now following mechanical pacing machines.\\" By 1904, over a dozen motor-pacing professionals, including some of the best in the world, had been killed from high speed crashes. Although Walthour had been lucky enough to avoid serious injury, he had seen several of his cohorts carried out on stretchers. In 1907, the dangers of motor-pacing caught up to Walthour and he was nearly killed twice. Though Walthour had some success after 1907, his career was never the same. He finished his career with a litany of broken ribs, broken collar bones, broken fingers and dozens of concussions.Atlanta Journal, May 27, 1904 Retirement and Death Walthour spent most of his retirement years living in New Jersey. Walthour had distanced himself from his son, Robert Howe Walthour Jr., over a religious squabble and the two rarely spoke. Bobby Walthour Jr. became a great cycling champion in his own right in the 1920s and 1930s. Walthour Sr. died in Boston at the age of 71. References * Nye, Peter (1988).

IDIRIYA was born from its founder‚Äôs passion for creating an environment that is accessible to all BY DESIGN with dignity, regardless of the degree of physical ability. Based in Sri Lanka, IDIRIYA comprises a group of professionals in diverse fields who offer their expertise and follow the principle that good design enables bad design disables. They have aggressively promoted in Sri Lanka the concept of 'Social Inclusion for All' by design focusing on built environments - Safety being a paramount feature - that does not marginalise or discriminate against people on the grounds of inevitable diversity in ability and campaigned against arbitrary categorization of people. Although IDIRIYA do not seek to people with restricted ability, they support and strive to emPower them to lobby individually and collectively for positive change of a dis-Abling society by design, to benefit their own day- to-day productive lives. The organisation receives no outside funding and has been kept functioning by voluntary contributions of time and resources, mainly by its members.

It was born from Perera‚Äôs (i).. Passion for creating an environment that is accessible and user-friendly equally to everyone, enabling choice and with dignity, (ii).. Commitment to make a consciousness-raising eye-opener on accessibility to built environments, technology, goods and services and (iii).. Desire to promote universal design principles. IDIRIYA have identified two prerequisites for a formidable and sustainable national economy: Viz. (i). Arresting the waste of productive human potential through mobilising the productive value of all people, able-bodied or otherwise, and (ii). Minimising unwanted dependents through empowering people. They believe that construction of environments for inclusion of all people and optimum use of technology in daily life is cost effective, realistic and the effective way to arrest colossal waste of precious assets, enhances gainful opportunities for an increasing wide range of people and make everyone meaningful equal partners in Sri Lankan National development. They realise the need for a new and more positive understanding and changing reactions to dis-ability and its related key issues. This requires opening of minds to the social model of disability that explains how it's the dis-Abling designs of social environment that renders a wide and diverse range of people increasingly dis-Abled. Vision IDIRIYA‚Äôs vision is: Safety and Inclusion with Accessibility to Empower People of All Abilities. Enabling the people who are severely ‚Äòdisadvantaged‚Äô or ‚Äòmarginalised‚Äô in day-to-day normal life due to continuing poor building design and thereby establishing a society that does not discriminate against people with limited mobility - an inevitable fact as life unfolds. Mission IDIRIYA‚Äôs mission is: Creating awareness, Engaging support and Catalysing change actively to promote built environments that can be used equally and safely by all sectors of society, with choice, with dignity and without any hindrance.

All members work in continuing to be: exceptionally responsive towards designing for inclusion of all, regardless of the degree of physical ability, and thereby emPowering everyone through 'increased opportunities' in daily life, to be more productive and gainful, healthier and full-fledged citizens. Significant contributions IDIRIYA recognise the fact that disability related internationally accepted design standards and regulations in building construction and design of key building parts by professionals in this vital industry, often run high risks of failure and thereby waste of resources in terms of practical implementation, if not backed by a good understanding of its intricacies and practical experience, as theory without practice is blind.

To ease the difficulty of finding the right help IDIRIYA has also stepped in here. Several organisations in Sri Lanka, both large and small, who desire to design and deliver better environments that can be used equally and safely by all sectors of society, regardless of their degree of ability, with dignity and with safety, have already benefited to get what they want here with the right guidance of Idiriya - a good testimony to their sincere commitment and proven competence.Ability within Disability, The Nation, Retrieved 30 November 2008An Enabling Environment for All , The Island, Retrieved 9 October 2007Achievers Recognised and Appreciated, The Nation, Retrieved on 29 June 2008 IDIRIYA in 2007 initiated action and paved the way in the establishment and launch of the first Sri Lanka Standard for design in building construction by the Sri Lanka Standards Institution - SLS ISO TR 9527:2006 - taking into consideration diversity in ability of people. Major achievements Accessibility to built environments is an indispensable inherent basic human right. Laws to require public buildings and facilities to be designed and constructed accessible to dis-abled persons were established in Sri Lanka in 1996 and further strengthened by the introduction of accessibility regulations under this law in 2005 and thereafter, receiving unanimous Parliament approval 0n 20 March 2007. However, inept bureaucracy failed to establish a formal mechanism to implement and pursue the legislation and thereby to deliver practical effect, even in respect of new public buildings. Violators roam scot-free, significant setbacks to gainful opportunities of disabled people, increasing numbers hence driven towards poverty affecting even their immediate families, waste of human potential, etc., and thereby reduce our limited resources causing substantial losses to the country. Even after 15 years this malady continues as the non-disabled decision makers fail to recognise this national disaster. Seeking redress for physically dis-Abled persons accessing new public buildings, a fundamental rights application [Ref: SCFR: 221/2009] aimed at preventing further colossal losses the country incurs, was filed by IDIRIYA at the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka in March 2009. Ajith C. S. Perera, honorary Secretary-General and Chief Executive of IDIRIYA (as at 25 December 2015) appearing in person, argued the need to have the disability access laws and regulations already enacted some years ago, fully enforced and implemented with respect to new public buildings in Sri Lanka. The bench headed by the then country's Chief Justice and the country's current Chief Justice as at 1 January 2016, in delivering their unanimous judgement on 27 April 2011 which further strengthened the order given earlier on 14 October 2009, issued landmark orders having the potential to reverse these adverse trends and reap over 30 rich dividends for the country and its people - disabled and non-disabled alike. This has been recognised in Sri Lanka as a significant achievement towards equalisation of opportunities, 'not simply' but the hard way, by the dis-abled for the dis- abled.

It is classified by DB Station&Service; as a category 3 station and is also Neumarkt's only long- distance stop.  Location and destinations  The station is located south of the Altstadt at the end of Bahnhofstrasse. The station building is on the northeast side of the Nuremberg‚ÄìRegensburg railway. Immediately next to the station building is platform 1, then platforms 2/4 and 5. Beyond that there are several shunting and storage sidings. South of the station the former Sulztalbahn branches off to Greiselbach. Today it acts as an industrial siding for the firms of Max B√∂gl at Sengenthal and Pfleiderer AG near the station, as well as being a storage siding for individual trains. Another siding, no longer used, turns off this one to Dehn und S√∂hne in Hans-Dehn-Strasse.  Transport links  Bus station Neumarkt station is served at least hourly by Regionalbahn trains to Nuremberg ‚Äì Erlangen ‚Äì Lichtenfels and to Regensburg ‚Äì Plattling. Regional-Express trains to Nuremberg and Munich run every 2 hours. These services form route R5 (N√ºrnberg ‚Äì Neumarkt ‚Äì Parsberg) in the Nuremberg Regional Transport Union (VGN) network. In addition, every morning and evening InterCity trains on the Passau ‚Äì Karlsruhe and Hamburg ‚Äì Passau routes also call at the station. Today there is a bus station on the site of the former goods station, which is served by the Neumarkt town bus company, as well as many Omnibusverkehr Franken (OVF) and Regionalbus Ostbayern (RBO) lines. From here buses can be caught to almost all parts of the town as well as the local county, Landkreis Neumarkt in der Oberpfalz, to Amberg and the stations at Allersberg and Kinding. There is also a taxi rank.  Service facilities  Being a long-distance and regional stop, the station has an extensive range of services. The Deutsche Bahn has a travel centre here; in addition there is a bakery with a caf√©, a kiosk and a newsagents. All platforms and the bus station are equipped with digital destination boards and an overview board of the current departure times is installed in the station hall. Platforms 1 and 5 are reached by a lift, platforms 2 and 4 have luggage conveyour belts. There is a public toilet at the bus station. In the immediate vicinity of the station are racks for over 400 bicycles and bays for about 60 cars. About 600 metres away the Parkhaus Ringstra√üe multi-storey car park rents long-term bays for customers of the VGN and RVV at reasonable rates.  History  The station building was completed by 1 December 1871 when the Nuremberg‚ÄìNeumarkt line opened. In 1873 the route was extended through to Regensburg. On 1 June 1888 trains began running from here on the Sulztalbahn to Beilngries and Freystadt. In addition to the passenger station, a goods station was also built, where goods from all the local companies were transferred to rail. On 22 April 1945 the station was almost totally destroyed in an air raid by the United States Air Force. Many men, including refugees on a train in the station, lost their lives. After the war's end the station was rebuilt and expanded. In addition, in the 1970s, track 3 was removed and the platforms for tracks 2 and 4 built in its place. After passenger services on the Sulztalbahn ceased on 25 September 1987, the station lost its function as a connecting station in the Altm√ºhl valley. Shortly afterwards the neighbouring goods station was closed. In 1995 a platform was built for track 5 and was equipped from the outset with a lift for disabled people. The former goods station was demolished in 1996/1997; in its place the present-day bus station was built. During the construction work, the station building was also fully refurbished and the station square completely relandscaped. On the platforms train destination displays were installed and in the station hall a TrainingPoint for DB trainees established that existed until 2007.  Plans  For the S-Bahn to Nuremberg, due to open in December 2010, in 2008 platforms 1 and 2/4 were refurbished and modernised. Both platforms were raised to a height of 76 cm, the platform roofing was extended. Platforms 2 and 4 are also being equipped with a lift.Neumarkter Nachrichten: ¬´Da bleibt kein Stein mehr auf dem anderen¬ª. Article of 12 November 2008.

Set in 1767, it follows the adventures of an idealistic young coal miner from Scotland who believes there must be more to life than working down the pit. The miner, Mack McAsh, eventually runs away in order to find work and a new life in London. Eventually McAsh becomes a leader amongst the working classes of the city and becomes a target for those vested interest groups who do not share his point of view. McAsh is framed for a crime he did not commit and sent to serve seven years hard labour in the Colony of Virginia where he is forced to find a new life. Historical events from the novel The novel initially deals with subject of the Payment of Arles, a form of serfdom for miners in the 18th century which meant that once a miner started work in a coal mine he was bound to the mine for the rest of his life.Working conditions of coal miners in the 18th century It was a custom for the master or landowner of the mine to give a gift to parents at the time of a child's baptism. The gift would then bind the child to work alongside the parents when they came of age.Mining Institute  Slavery in the coal mines of Scotland In London the novel places McAsh at the center of the discontent of 1768 which saw working people become dissatisfied with a higher cost of living and poor wages. McAsh had become the leader of a gang of coal heavers, one of many such gangs of men who had the job of physically unloading the coal barges when they came into the city. The discontent eventually led to riots and unrest across the city. After being caught in the middle of a riot, McAsh is captured and sentenced to transportation to America, a form of punishment which was often seen as an effective alternative to the death penalty during that period. Once arriving in the Colony of Virginia, McAsh is sold into slavery and made to work as a field hand before escaping to the western frontier and eventually finding his freedom.

The trick film, according to Michael Brooke of BFI Screenonline, \\"is an example of Smith's interest in cinematic effects - including, here, the use of superimposition to suggest ghosts,\\" which, \\"is notable for its then sophisticated mix of wide establishing shots and medium close-ups,\\" and, \\"also contains two wipes to denote a change of scene.\\" Plot A housemaid (played by Smith's wife, Laura Bayley) starts a fire in the kitchen stove by putting paraffin on it. It causes an explosion that sends her up the chimney. She emerges from the chimney pot on top of the house and her scattered remains fall to the ground. Later, Mary Jane's ghost rises from her grave to find her paraffin can and once she finds it, she goes to her final resting place. Production The plot of Mary Jane's Mishap was probably inspired by a 1901 Edison Manufacturing Company film, The Finish of Bridget McKeen, but is enlarged to include new material, including a vein of dark comedy typical of the Brighton School of filmmaking. Mary Jane's Mishap was filmed in Smith's studio at St. Ann's Well Gardens, Hove. Most film historians have described the film's production as taking place in 1903, although John Barnes instead considered a production date of August 1902 to be more plausible. Critical analysis John Barnes has written that \\"this could be considered as the first modern film\\", describing it as \\"far ahead of its time as regards film technique\\".

He had made his fortune in the Far East, returned to Damascus many years later and built this beautiful house. The family story was that he had lent much money to the Sultan of Turkey who then refused to repay him. The family in desperation asked the Kaiser of Germany to intervene, and he did. The Sultan was so furious that he never returned the funds and Mr. Anbar then went into bankruptcy and lost the house. The family later was said to have immigrated to Alexandria in Egypt. The house is built around three courtyards, first the formal reception courtyard, behind this the attractive female courtyard, and finally the spartan servants' courtyard. Due to the cost of building, the owner turned the building into the Damascus Civil Preparatory School, which was a prestigious, expensive, tuition-based school for the children of the land-owning families of Damascus.

He knew more than 20 languages. Many literary works were successfully translated from the majority of these languages and introduced to the Ukrainian literature by him. The literary prize Ars Translationis has been instituted by \\"Vsesvit\\" since 1989 to commemorate Lukash. Lukash was born into a family of teachers. From childhood he picked up foreign languages with ease. He began studying at the History Faculty of the Kyiv State University, but his studies were interrupted by the Second World War. He fought in the Soviet Army from 1943. In 1947 after graduating from the Institute of Foreign Languages in Kharkiv, Lukash worked as a teacher of foreign languages. He then became head of the Department of Poetry for the journal ‚ÄúVsesvit‚Äù [‚ÄúUniverse‚Äù]. Lukash was blessed with phenomenal linguistic talents and had an extraordinarily wide knowledge of foreign literature. He is considered to have been one of the most outstanding Ukrainian translators, translating literary works from 20 languages. He was also one of the figures who created an alternative Ukrainian culture. He was most prolific during the relatively favourable twenty-year period between 1953 and 1973, when he translated Goethe‚Äôs ‚ÄúFaust‚Äù, Flaubert‚Äôs ‚ÄúMadame Bovary‚Äù, the poetry of Schiller, Boccaccio‚Äôs ‚ÄúDecameron‚Äù and many other works. He was a member of the Union of Writers of Ukraine from 1956 and played an active role in Ukrainian literary life. Lukash always gave moral support to writers who were being oppressed. Then after the arrest of I. DZIUBA, whom Lukash considered to be the most outstanding figure in Ukrainian culture, he sent a letter to the Head of the Presidium of the Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian SSR, the Head of the Ukrainian Supreme Court and the General Prosecutor of the Ukrainian SSR with a copy to the Presidium of the Administration of the Union of Writers of Ukraine, in which he disagreed with the court ruling, calling it unjust, protested against the expulsion of I.DZIUBA from the Union of Writers of Ukraine (UWU) and offered as a person living alone to serve the sentence instead of I.DZIUBA who was a family man and in bad health: ‚ÄúI humbly ask that you allow me to serve the period of imprisonment in his place...‚Äù This act cost Lukash dear. He was dismissed from the editorial board of the journal ‚ÄúVsesvit‚Äù and told that he would be forcibly treated in a special psychiatric hospital. Fortunately these threats were not carried out. On 12 June 1973 the Presidium of the Administration of the UWU voted unanimously to expel Lukash from the Union. While discussing his personal case, Lukash stated that during the previous years he had been terrorised, not allowed to work normally, that he, indeed, disagreed with the ruling of the court in I. DZIUBA‚Äôs case, that everybody had pushed him to retract his criticism but that he considered that even if he were to withdraw ‚Äúmy groan of pain‚Äù, nobody would believe him in any case. For many years he was effectively under house arrest. He was persecuted in all possible ways and his works stopped being published, depriving him of means of existence. For a long time there was a police officer permanently stationed at the entry to his block who didn‚Äôt allow anyone to visit him. Lukash was reinstated in the UWU on the wave of perestroika in 1987, when he was almost a dying man. In 1988 he became Laureate of the Maxim Rylsky Republic Award. Within a few months, on 29 August 1988, Mykola Lukash died. He did not live to see the publication of a large volume of his translations which came out under the title ‚ÄúFrom Bocaccio to Apollinaire‚Äù in 1990 and became a kind of monument to Lukash. The compiler of the volume, M.

The wheel consisted of curved or tilted spokes partially filled with mercury. Once in motion, the mercury would flow from one side of the spoke to another, thus forcing the wheel to continue motion, in constant dynamic equilibrium. Like all perpetual-motion machines, Bhaskara's wheel is a long-discredited mechanism. To truly overbalance the wheel (so that torque in one direction is greater than the other) and cause motion, the radius of the spokes would have to be altered throughout the course of the wheel's motion. This would have to be done actively, thus consuming energy in the process ‚Äî and so the machine would cease to be a perpetual-motion engine. It's also important to consider the wheel as it moves, as it can be placed into an overbalanced position so that the math makes it appear that there is an overall torque.Magical Machines - The Overbalanced Wheel It is perfectly possible for the wheel to exert a motion if it is placed off balance (much in the same way a pendulum will swing if moved out of a perfectly vertical position), but that motion does not continue indefinitely and will eventually be counteracted.

She was refloated and then beached off Bangor. Later she was towed to Belfast and then Glasgow for repairs, arriving on 25 September 1944. ;JW 63 Convoy JW 63 sailed from Loch Ewe on 30 December 1944 and arrived at the Kola Inlet on 8 January 1945.

They wear a traditional outfit called the casera dress. For girls it consists of a long skirt and a long-sleeved old-fashioned shirt with headscarves and aprons. The boys wear a long black shirt, trousers and txapela (traditional black beret). The casera outfits are normally dark blue, but can come in many colors. They wear caseras because that is what the people of the mountain wear and the holiday used to celebrate the peasants who sold their goods in town and came on Santo Tomas to pay rent to landlords in the city. The Santa of Basque Country In the Basque Country the equivalent of Santa is Olentzero, and Olentzero lives or lived (depending on what you believe) in the mountains, and he wears the boys' casera. He is a mythical Basque character who is widely portrayed as a messenger who cries out that it is Christmas time throughout all the corners of the Basque Country.Christmas in Basque country at the Euskadil Tourism board Retrieved 29 May 2013 In some versions, the Olentzero is a farmer or a shepherd.

By tradition, on December 24, the Basque television and radio stations broadcast that the Olentzero has begun his journey from the mountains to children's homes. In Francoist Spain (1939 - 1975), Olentzero was banned as a symbol of regional separatism. It was only after the Spanish transition to democracy that the tradition was restored to the Basque Country.

The day after in the morning, whether it's raining or snowing, it's a tradition for some people to go swim in the sea (if there is a sea in their town or city). The one other day that is important to the Basques is the 6th of January (the Day of the Three Kings). On that night the same happens.

Wheat grows lushly on this soil, where it seems to find all the necessary conditions to thrive. Every other year they plant horsebean, because oat does not flourish here. They also plant lupines, now already green, which will ripen by the month of March. Flax too, is already sown; buried into the ground throughout the winter, it is toughened by the freezing cold. ¬ª.

History The Bank of England acts as the UK's central bank, influencing interest rates paid by private banks, to achieve targets in inflation, growth and employment. The Bank of England was originally established as a corporation with private shareholders under the Bank of England Act 1694,5 & 6 Will & Mar c 20. to raise money for war with Louis XIV, King of France. After the South Sea Company collapsed in a speculative bubble in 1720, the Bank of England became the dominant financial institution, and acted as a banker to the UK government and other private banks.EP Ellinger, E Lomnicka and CVM Hare, Ellinger‚Äôs Modern Banking Law (5th edn 2011) ch 2, 30 The Bank of England could, simply by being the biggest financial institution, influence interest rates that other banks charged to businesses and consumers by altering its interest rate for the banks' bank accounts.So, if the Bank of England raised its interest rate for Barings Bank's account with it, Barings would probably try to raise its interest rates for customers with Barings Bank accounts (unless competition was very tight, in which case its profits would have to be reduced). The Bank of England Act 1716 widened its borrowing power. The Bank Restriction Act 1797 removed a requirement to convert notes to gold on demand. The Bank Charter Act 1844 gave the bank sole rights to issue notes and coins. It also acted as a lender through the 19th century in emergencies to finance banks facing collapse.See W Bagehot, Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market (1873) discussing Overend, Gurney and Co Because of its power, many believed the Bank of England should have more public duties and supervision. The Bank of England Act 1946 nationalised it. Its current constitution, and guarantees of a degree of operational independence from government, is found in the Bank of England Act 1998. *Macmillan Committee (1929) Central bank UK banking has two main parts.See EP Ellinger, E Lomnicka and CVM Hare, Ellinger's Modern Law of Banking (2011) chs 1-2 and 5 First, the Bank of England administers monetary policy, influencing interest rates, inflation and employment, and it regulates the banking market with HM Treasury, the Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority. Second, there are private banks, and some non- shareholder banks (co-operatives, mutual or building societies), that provide credit to consumer and business clients. Borrowing money on credit (and repaying the debtDebt capital finance contrasts with equity capital finance, where an investor buys shares, invariably with voting rights, in a company. Debt finance usually keeps the borrower in control of their business, subject to any restrictive covenants and the need to repay the debt. later) is important for people expand a business, invest in a new enterprise, or purchase valuable assets more quickly than by saving. Every day, banks estimate the prospects of a borrower succeeding or failing, and set interest rates for debt repayments according to their predictions of the risk (or average risk of ventures like it). If all banks together lend more money, this means enterprises will do more, potentially employ more people, and if business ventures are productive in the long run, society's prosperity will increase. If banks charge interest that people cannot afford, or if banks lend too much money to ventures that are unproductive, economic growth will slow, stagnate, and sometimes crash. Although UK banks, except the Bank of England, are shareholder or mutually owned, many countries operate public retail banks (for consumers) and public investment banks (for business). The UK used to run Girobank for consumers, and there have been many proposals for a \\"British Investment Bank\\" (like the Nordic Investment Bank or KfW in Germany) since the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, but these proposals have not yet been accepted. =Central bank governance= Under the Bank of England Act 1998 section 1, the bank's executive body, the \\"Court of Directors\\" is \\"appointed by Her Majesty\\", which in effect is the Prime Minister.By contrast the US Federal Reserve Act of 1913, 12 USC ¬ß241, requires that on advice and consent of the Senate, appointments by the President ‚Äòshall have due regard to a fair representation of the financial, agricultural, industrial and commercial interests, and geographical divisions of the country.‚Äô Under ¬ß302, in the Federal Reserve system of constituent banks, three are chosen by and to represent stockholding banks, six others, represent the public and elected to represent stakeholders. In the EU, TFEU art 283(2), states the European Central Bank's Executive Board (a president, vice president and four members) are appointed by the European Council by qualified majority, after consulting the European Parliament and the Governing Council of the ECB. The Governing Council is itself the Executive Board plus governors of the national central banks using the euro. The term is 8 years, non-renewable, and they can only be removed for gross misconduct after review by the CJEU: ECB Statute arts 10-11. This includes the Governor of the Bank of England (currently Andrew Bailey) and up to 14 directors in total (currently there are 12, 9 men and 3 womenSee 'Court of Directors' on bankofengland.co.uk).BEA 1998 s 1A allows the Treasury to add directors, or reduce the number of directors, after consultation, with some limitations. The Governor may serve for a maximum of 8 years, deputy governors for a maximum of 10 years,BEA 1998 Sch 1, paras 1-2 but they may be removed only if they acquire a political position, work for the bank, are absent for over 3 months, become bankrupt, or \\"is unable or unfit to discharge his functions as a member\\".BEA 1998 Sch 1, paras 7-8 This makes removal hard, and potentially a court review. A sub-committee of directors sets pay for all directors,BEA 1998 Sch 1, paras 14 rather than a non-conflicted body like Parliament. =Interest rates= The Bank of England provides finance and support to, and may influence interest rates of the private banks through monetary policy. Possibly the Bank's most important function is administering monetary policy. This affects growth and employment. Under BEA 1998 section 11 its objectives are to (a) \\"maintain price stability, and (b) subject to that, to support the economic policy of Her Majesty‚Äôs Government, including its objectives for growth and employment.\\"In the US, the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, 12 USC ¬ß225 states ‚ÄòThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy‚Äôs long run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.‚Äô Under TFEU art 9, and see also 127 and 119-150 the EU should aim at a \\"high level of employment\\". By contrast TEU art 3(3) says it should be ‚Äòaiming at full employment‚Äô. See M Roth, ‚ÄòEmployment as a Goal of Monetary Policy of the European Central Bank‚Äô (2015) ssrn.com. Under section 12, the Treasury issues its interpretation of \\"price stability\\" and \\"economic policy\\" each year, together with an inflation target. To change inflation, the Bank of England has three main policy options.R Cranston, Principles of Banking Law (2002) 121-122 First, it performs \\"open market operations\\", buying and selling banks' bonds at differing rates (i.e. loaning money to banks at higher or lower interest, known \\"discounting\\"), buying back government bonds (\\"repos\\") or selling them, and giving credit to banks at differing rates.In the EU, TFEU art 123 contains a prohibition on the European Central Bank lending money to governments, but in Gauweiler v Deutscher Bundestag (2015) C-62/14 the CJEU approved the use of outright monetary transactions to buy Greek government debt on secondary markets (to support the euro) was lawful. This will affect the interest rate banks charge by influencing the quantity of money in the economy (more spending by the central bank means more money, and so lower interest) but also may not.Cranston (2002) 121, ‚ÄòThis will typically, in turn, produce a change in the base rates of the banks.‚Äô Second, the Bank of England may direct banks to keep different higher or lower reserves proportionate to their lending.BEA 1946 s 4(3). No order has been issued, but banks generally comply with the Bank of England's suggested reserve ratios. Cranston (2002) 121, ‚ÄòThe size of the reserves clearly determines the volume of money in circulation and the extent to which a bank can itself extend credit to its customers.‚Äô Third, the Bank of England could direct private banks adopt specific deposit taking or lending policies, in specified volumes or interest rates.See Monetary Control (1980) Cmnd 7858. The Treasury is, however, only meant to give orders to the Bank of England in \\"extreme economic circumstances\\".BEA 1998 s 19 This should ensure that changes to monetary policy are undertaken neutrally, and artificial booms are not manufactured before an election. =Private bank oversight= *Bank of England Act 1998 *Three Rivers DC v Bank of England *Bank of Credit and Commerce International Private bank governance The largest UK banks are HSBC, Barclays, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds. Outside the central bank, banks are mostly run as profit-making corporations, without meaningful representation for customers. This means, the standard rules in the Companies Act 2006 apply. =Directors and shareholders= Directors are usually appointed by existing directors in the nomination committee,Companies (Model Articles) Regulations 2008, Sch 3, para 20 and UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 section B unless the members of a company (invariably shareholders) remove them by majority vote.Companies Act 2006 ss 168-9 Bank directors largely set their own pay, delegating the task to a remuneration committee of the board.Companies (Model Articles) Regulations 2008, Sch 3, para 23 and UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 section D Most shareholders are asset managers, exercising votes with other people's money that comes through pensions, life insurance or mutual funds, who are meant to engage with boards,UK Corporate Governance Code 2016, section E but have few explicit channels to represent the ultimate investors.See E McGaughey, 'Does corporate governance exclude the ultimate investor?' (2016) Journal of Corporate Law Studies Asset managers rarely sue for breach of directors' duties (for negligence or conflicts of interest), through derivative claims.Companies Act 2006 ss 170-77, 260-263 Concerns about \\"short-termism\\" have been written about by the Kay Review (2014) on short and long term thinking in equity markets, and the Walker Review (2009) on bank governance. These have not yet examined the responsibility of institutional investors, and asset managers who vote with other people's money. =Employee rights= Since the Credit Institutions Directive 2013,2013/36/EU arts 88-96 there are some added governance requirements beyond the general framework: for example, duties of directors must be clearly defined, and there should be a policy on board diversity to ensure gender and ethnic balance. If the UK had employee representation on boards, there would also be a requirement for at least one employee to sit on the remuneration committee, but this step has not yet been taken. The Credit Institutions Directive 2013 (2013/36/EU article 95 states \\"If employee representation... is provided for by national law, the remuneration committee shall include one or more employee representatives.\\" =Licensing and passport= There is some public oversight through the bank licensing system.Before FSMA 2000 ss 19-23 and 418-9, the Banking Act 1979 introduced the formal authorisation requirements. Under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 section 19 there is a \\"general prohibition\\" on performing a \\"regulated activity\\", including accepting deposits from the public, without authority.See also Credit Institutions Directive 2013/36/EU arts 8-14 The two main UK regulators are the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority. Once a bank has received authorisation in the UK, or another member state, it may operate throughout the EU under the terms of the host state's rules: it has a \\"passport\\" giving it freedom of establishment in the internal market. Customer rights had been forced to nationalise Northern Rock, Bradford & Bingley, the Royal Bank of Scotland and part of HBOS-Lloyds TSB. The Banking Act 2009 contains a system to stop systemic crisis from banker insolvency. While banks perform an essential economic function, supported by public institutions, the rights of bank customers have generally been limited to contract. =Customer accounts= In general terms and conditions, customers receive very limited protection. The Consumer Credit Act 1974 sections 140A to 140D prohibit unfair credit relationships, including extortionate interest rates. The Consumer Rights Act 2015 sections 62 to 65 prohibit terms that create contrary to good faith, create a significant imbalance, but the courts have not yet used these rules in a meaningful way for consumers.See Office of Fair Trading v Abbey National plc [2009] UKSC 6 and Director General of Fair Trading v First National Bank plc [2001] UKHL 52 Most importantly, since Foley v Hill the courts have held customers who deposit money in a bank account lose any rights of property by default: they apparently have only contractual claims in debt for the money to be repaid.(1848) 2 HLC 28 If customers did have property rights in their deposits, they would be able to claim their money back upon a bank's insolvency, trace the money if it had been wrongly paid away, and (subject to agreement) claim profits made on the money. However, the courts have denied that bank customers have property rights.Vincent v Trustee Savings Banks Central Board [1986] 1 WLR 1077, denying that the Trustee Savings Bank customers were, despite the name of the bank, in any trustee-beneficiary relation, either at common law or under statute. The customers, apparently, only had contractual rights. The same position has generally spread in banking practice globally, and Parliament has not yet taken the opportunity to ensure banks offer accounts where customer money is protected as property.See the Safety Deposit Current Accounts Bill 2008 cls 1-2, proposing a proprietary saving account option. =Deposit protection= Because insolvent banks do not enable customers to recover their money as a property right (only contract), governments have found it necessary to publicly guarantee depositors' savings. This follows the model, started in the Great Depression,Banking Act of 1933 the US set up the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to prevent bank runs. In 2017, the UK guaranteed deposits up to ¬£85,000,Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 ss 214-215 mirroring an EU wide minimum guarantee of ‚Ç¨100,000.See the Deposit Guarantee Directive 2014/49/EU MarketsInsolvency= Because of the knock-on consequences of any bank failure, because bank debts are locked into a network of international finance, government has found it practically necessary to prevent banks going insolvent. This system began with the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008, emergency legislation for the nationalisation of Northern Rock, which was recast the following year. Under the Banking Act 2009 if a bank is going into insolvency, the government may (and usually will if \\"the stability of the financial systems\\" is at stake) pursue one of three \\"stabilisation options\\".See Banking Act 2009 ss 1, 7-13 The Bank of England will either try to ensure the failed bank is sold onto another private sector purchaser, set up a subsidiary company to run the failing bank's assets (a \\"bridge-bank\\"), or for the UK Treasury to directly take shares in \\"temporary public ownership\\". This will wipe out the shareholders, but will keep creditors' claims intact. All other standard rules of the Insolvency Act 1986 apply, including wrongful trading provisions, and the rules in the Company Director Disqualification Act 1986. =Capital requirements= One fashionable method to prevent bank insolvencies, following the \\"Basel III\\" programme of the international banker group, has been to require banks hold more money in reserve based on how risky their lending is. EU wide rules in the Capital Requirements Regulation 2013 achieve this in some detail, for instance requiring proportionally less in reserves if sound government debt is held, but more if mortgage-backed securities are held.(EU) No 575/2013, arts 114-134 It is not clear that a lack of capital is the root cause of the problem, although the Basel Committee of banks advocates it. =Competition law= *Competition Act 1998 *Libor scandal See also *UK company law *UK enterprise law *Bank regulation in the United States *Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act of 1933 *Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 NotesReferences *EP Ellinger, E Lomnicka and CVM Hare, Ellinger's Modern Law of Banking (2011) Category:Bank regulation ","title":"United Kingdom banking law"},{"id":"20951228","text":"Song of Dolores () is a 1947 Spanish drama film directed by Benito Perojo, written by Francisco Madrid.

Playing career After coming to hurling prominence as a student at CBS Kilkenny, Mulcahy won back-to-back All-Ireland Minor Championships with Kilkenny in 1935 and 1936. He was promoted to the Kilkenny junior side in 1938 and in the following year he won his first senior All-Ireland medal when Kilkenny beat Cork in the \\"thunder and lightning\\" final.

Her father was a chartered accountant and her grandfather was David Berry Hart a renowned Edinburgh surgeon. At six weeks old Lines' family moved to Carthage in Tunisia. At the age of two she returned to London. Her father then got job with the Trinidad telephone company. The family was ready to return from Trinidad to England when war broke out. Lines spent her early childhood in Trinidad swimming and climbing trees. In 1944, following her father‚Äôs injury, the family returned by convoy to England, landing in Liverpool. After a stay with relatives in Birkenhead her father returned to the Edinburgh firm where he had been articled. The family moved to St Andrews in the Kingdom of Fife for two years where she acquired her love of Scottish folk tales. Lines attended Birkenhead High School where she was a friend of Patricia Routledge. Following three and a half years at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and winning a major prize, Lines joined a Summer repertory theatre company in Perranporth in Cornwall. During a forces tour with Eileen Atkins she met her husband Graham Lines. The company was run by Peter Southey who drove the company around in a Rolls Royce with a trailer. Lines then became an English teacher, working at Fox School in West London providing music for the infants and choir and running the drama club. A now lost play from the early 1970s concerned children who break into a professor‚Äôs lab and are shrunk to the size of gnats. With Rosalind Rowland, Lines wrote two musicals, a choral fantasy and four songs. In 1976 Eimear Murphy suggested that Lines meet John Bishop and Betty Roe. Lines and Roe were subsequently introduced at a party and their working partnership has proved to be prolific and popular. Lines was an enthusiastic member of the Association of English Singers & Speakers. Television Lines played a Southern Belle in the BBC production of Mrs Patterson with Eartha Kitt. Lines wrote Granny's Kitchen for Yorkshire Television with Joy Whitby. This was a cookery programme for small children and Lines appeared as 'Granny' in the pilot episode. Lines and Whitby also wrote the scripts for the Giddy Game Show. Lines also featured in numerous radio broadcasts. Works with music by Rosalind Rowland The Three Enchanters (1971) based on a Russian folk story. Lines designed and assisted in making the costumes based on Russian folk dress. Characters included the three enchanters, Baba Yaga and the hut on hens legs familiar from Mussorsky‚Äôs pictures at an exhibition. The Illustrator Michael Foreman expressed interest in developing the work but did not pursue the project. The Brocklehursts was about a Victoria family with four children. One daughter is frequently naughty. In dream sequences she visits a land of sweets and the land of the witches. Tam Lin Choral folk fantasy based on the Scottish folk tale and a precursor of the \\"fables\\"; Blacksmith and the Changeling and Burd Ellen. A recording exists but the score is thought to be lost. The first four poems in Tower Blocks were originally written as four songs for the School Choir. BooksFor children= Having written the first four poems of Tower Blocks to be set to music, Lines was introduced to the Children's book publisher Franklin Watts who commissioned a further 28 poems. The volume was published with illustrations by Charles Keeping and was intended for Children aged 12 to 14. The poems give a snap shot of life for children in West London in the 1960s including the then recently constructed M4 flyover at Ladbroke Grove. Two key and contrasting poems present both sides about life in tower blocks; one child is lonely in the tower block but another is pleased to be out of the rat-infested slum. With her husband Graham Lines, Lines re-told the stories of Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream for children. These were published with illustrations by Brian Froud. The illustrations had originally been commissioned to accompany the retellings by Charles Lamb (writer) and the Lines‚Äô versions needed to fit into the areas around these illustrations. Spiders of the Morning is a novel for children with drawings by Diana de Vere Cole. The Illustrator‚Äôs husband, Tristan de Vere Cole, was the director of Kenilworth (the 1967 BBC TV serial), in which Graham Lines played Leicester. Play and Learn contains five short stories for Children. =Lyrics= Lines by Lines, a collection of Lines' lyrics and extracts from her libretti, was published by Matador in 2012. Musical revues Lines wrote two revues, Mrs Worthington‚Äôs Secret Heart and Let‚Äôs Kick Mrs Worthington, for the duo Divas 2, and were premi√®red at the Edinburgh festivals in 2001 and 2002. The songs for both shows were taken from the works of No√´l Coward and Cole Porter. Works with music by Betty Roe Starting with their initial collaboration The Barnstormers (1976), re-published with new teaching materials by ChesterNovello, to Brunel: The Little Man in the Tall Hat (2006) Lines and Betty Roe have had a productive partnership, writing six operas, twelve musicals for children, a pantomime, Dick Whittington (2005) and numerous pieces for choirs. =Operas= *The Legend of Gallant Bevis of Southampton (1977) *Gaslight (1983) *A Flight of Pilgrims (1992) *Lunch at the Cooked Goose (2000) *Welcome to Purgatory (2003) *Brunel: The Little Man in the Tall Hat (2006) =Musicals= *The Barnstormers (1976) *Kookajoo and the Magic Forest *The Most Wanted Faces (1978) *Pardon our Rubbish *Christmas Boxes (1980) From which are extracted the songs, Christmas Cards. *The Trouble with spells is‚Ä¶ (1982) *The Mistress of Charlecote Park *Destination London (Contributed two numbers) *The Miracle Masque (1983) *The Pink Parakeet (1984) *Crowds (1988) *Astron (1994) *The Storm Hound (1996) Based on the legend of Black Shuck *Floating (2002) *The Magic Fishbone (Awaiting publication) Based on the short story by Charles Dickens =Choral and other vocal works= *Burd Ellen (1976) *A Crown of Briar Roses (1977) For Queen Elizabeth II‚Äôs Silver Jubilee *Circe Beguiled, a scena (1978).

The secular parts of the nearby village of St Dominick once belonged to the estate. History From a poor background, Sir James Tillie (16 November 1645 ‚Äì 15 November 1713) rose through the ranks, and became an agent for Sir John Coryton (son of William Coryton), owner of the estate, Newton Ferrers. Soon after the sudden death of Sir John, Tillie improved his fortunes by wedding his patron's widow, Elizabeth. Tillie then divided the Newton Ferrers estate, and commissioned the building of Pentillie, which was completed in 1698. James Tillie died in 1713, leaving the Pentillie estate to his nephew, James Woolley. On his death the estate was passed to Woolley's daughter Mary Jemima, who went on to marry Peter Coryton, the new heir of Newton Ferrers, thereby reuniting the two estates. Pentillie then became the main seat of the Coryton family in Cornwall. The Corytons were a prosperous 18th-century family, becoming owners of more than of land in Cornwall. In 1809, the family appointed the famous landscape designer Humphry Repton, to draw up plans for a remodelling of Pentillie. Repton envisaged an impressive Gothic Revival castle, and as a consequence of his vision, Pentillie was extensively enlarged in 1810, with the construction of three new wings to the west side of the old structure. The building thus enclosed a central open courtyard. Pentillie remained in the ownership of the Coryton family throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. During the Second World War the south wing of Pentillie Castle was requisitioned, and used as maternity ward for the local population. By the 1960s the house was in a poor state of repair, and the decision was taken to demolish most of the 1810 construction. The subsequently remodelled Pentillie Castle was declared a listed building in 1968. In 2007, Pentillie was inherited by Ted Spencer and his wife Sarah (they have subsequently changed their surname to Coryton). In 2009 and 2011, Pentillie was the subject of a Channel 4 television programme presented by hotelier Ruth Watson as part of her Country House Rescue series.Channel 4 - Country House Rescue - The sprawling Pentillie estate Pentillie Castle has also featured as a film location on a number of occasions, notably as 'Pentillie House' in the German adaptation of Rosamunde Pilcher's 'Im Zweifel f√ºr die Liebe' (2009) and as the Penrose Hotel in Sky 1's hotel drama 'Delicious'. Pentillie Mausoleum In 2013, archeologists discovered human remains at the Grade II* listed mausoleum at Pentillie, despite suggestions in the 19th Century that all bodies had been removed from the site. It is speculated that the remains are of the original owner of Pentillie, James Tillie. In his will, Tillie had instructed that he should not be buried, but dressed in his best clothes, bound to a stout chair and placed with his books, wine and pipe in the vault of the mausoleum. Investigations as to whether these are the remains of James Tillie continue.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-21412875 Pentillie today Today, Pentillie Castle is available for hire for weddings, civil partnerships, corporate events and private parties. Accommodation at the castle is also available. In addition, the estate's gardens are being restored and are open to the public on specific open days.

He goes through training at Liverpool, near Sydney, and encourages other men to join up, putting up a recruiting poster. A pacifist tears the poster down but Will sees him off. Before leaving Australia, he proposes to Lily Branton (Loma Rossmore). Arriving in Egypt, Will is stationed at Mena camp near the Great Pyramid at Giza, and trains with the other troops. They then move to Gallipoli, where Will takes part in the first wave ashore on 25 April 1915. He fights a Turkish sniper hand to hand and drowns him. He returns home wounded and marries Lily.

It was a sequel to Will they Never Come? (1915), using many of the same cast and crew. It too was made with the co- operation of the Department of Defence. The film was written by the same team who had done Will They Never Come?. Co-writer Phil Gell allegedly wanted to enlist but was asked not to until he had written this film. Some commentators believe Australasian Films were partly motivated to make the movie to ensure government protection of the film industry during the war.Paul Byrnes, 'The Hero of the Dardanelles' at Australian Screen Online The landing at Gallipoli was restaged with one thousand real troops from Liverpool Camp at Tamarama Beach in Sydney. Lead actor Guy Hastings was at the time best known for appearing on stage in Bert Bailey's production of On Our Selection. The original film ran for approximately 4,000 feet (59 minutes at 18 frames per second), but only 21 minutes survives. Reception The film was very popular at the box office and was screened to the Prime Minister and Premier of Victoria. A copy was placed in the archives of Federal Parliament. It was used as a recruiting tool, taken around the country by members of the armed forces for special screenings. Footage from the film was later used in the movie The Spirit of Gallipoli (1928).

History The origins of the school started in the 1890s (probably 1893), when sisters Emma and Jane Moody started a private nursery school for boys and girls, located in their house in Iffley Road, east Oxford. By 1898, the school had moved to a cottage in Cowley Place, south from The Plain, on the River Cherwell close to Magdalen Bridge and Magdalen College School. The school was named after the Milham Ford across the river close to this location. The original Milham Ford was used to talke stone during the building of Christ Church, Oxford, the largest college of Oxford University, to avoid damaging Magdalen Bridge. There was also a Milham Bridge here, but this was demolished during the English Civil War. In 1904, the school was sold to the Church Education Corporation by Emma and Jane Moody. The original cottage was enlarged in 1906. It began as a private foundation but in 1923 was sold to the City of Oxford local education authority, which rapidly expanded it by adding huts as extra classrooms. In 1939, the school moved to new and larger premises on a site between Harberton Mead (which was its address) and Marston Road, south of Jack Straw's Lane.Jack Straw's Lane . The original foundation stone from 1906 was moved to the new site in Marston. One of the huts was later dismantled re-erected in Cowley as a bandhall for the City of Oxford Silver Band.

In addition to her own work, Flower became known for her friendships including those with William Johnson Fox, Robert Browning, John Stuart Mill and Harriet Taylor. Biography Flower was born at Harlow, Essex in 1803 to radical journalist Benjamin Flower and philanthropist Eliza Gould. Her younger sister was the poet Sarah Fuller Flower Adams. From the age of four, Eliza Flower showed a promising aptitude for music and composition. Flower, her father and her sister were all regular contributors to Unitarian minister William Johnson Fox's periodical the Monthly Repository. Following Benjamin Flower's death, Eliza and Sarah lived with Fox as his wards until Sarah's marriage in 1834 to William Bridges Adams, and Eliza's death in 1846. Fox was married (and separated) and his friendship with Eliza Flower, and their living arrangements, though platonic, brought rumour and social ostracism towards her. Flower and Fox were friends with unmarried couple, politician and philosopher John Stuart Mill and women's rights advocate Harriet Taylor. Flower's first published musical work was Four Musical Illustrations of the Waverley Novels in 1831, setting to music several of Sir Walter Scott's romantic songs. She later wrote music for works by her sister, including her hymn \\"Nearer, My God, to Thee\\", which formed part of a collection by Fox called Hymns and Anthems. She wrote music sung at the funeral of Hindu reformist Ram Mohan Roy. During her lifetime, reviewers considered her the greatest female composer. Flower died on 12 December 1846 from consumption while at Hurstpierpoint, near Brighton.http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/9762 Friendship with Robert Browning Flower and her sister Sarah became acquainted with the young poet Robert Browning. Flower was shown a manuscript of Browning's Incondita, a collection of poems written at the age of 12, by his mother. Impressed, Flower showed them to W. J. Fox. Fox also liked the poems but convinced Browning that they were not good enough for publication. The poems were eventually destroyed by Browning, with much of his other work, in 1884. Browning developed a boyish love for Flower, nine years his senior, and remained fond of her until her death. She was the inspiration for his poem \\"Pauline\\".

Web. 29 Mar. 2015. =Major League Baseball (1948-1954)= At the age of 24, Rice finally got his shot in the major leagues. On September 25, 1948, Rice was called up to the Cardinals for the first time as a reserve leftfielder. Rice wound up only being on the team for 8 games that year, but despite that, he managed to record a BA of .323, with 10 hits, 1 double, and 2 triples in 33 plate appearances. In 1949 Rice played 40 games for the Cardinals batting .196, with 9 hits, 2 doubles, 1 triple, and 1 homerun in 49 plate appearances, playing in left field.\\" Due to His abysmal year in 1949, Rice was sent back down to Rochester for the majority of the 1950 season.

Web. 29 Mar. 2015. In 1952, for the first time since 1949, Hal Rice was not bumped to Rochester at any point during the season, and he spent the entire year on the Major League Club. Rice now 28 years old, played in a career high 98 games for the Cardinals, batting .288 with 85 hits, 14 doubles, 5 triples, 7 home runs, and 45 RBIs. Despite his great 1952 season, Hal played in only 8 games for St. Louis batting .250 before he was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates on June 14, 1953. On June 14, 1953, Hal was traded to The Pittsburgh Pirates for longtime infielder Pete Castiglione. That year for the pirates, Rice played left field nearly day during the final 78 games of the season. In that 78 game span, he amassed a batting average of .311 and he drove in 42 runs. At the Beginning of the next season, Rice struggled mightily for the pirates hitting only .173 through the middle of June and he only played in 28 of the first 58 games. On June 14, 1954, exactly a year after being traded to the Pirates, Pittsburgh traded Hal to the Chicago Cubs for outfielder Luis Marquez. Hal‚Äôs abysmal season that started in Pittsburgh continued during his stint on the cubs as he only hit for .153 for the rest of the season. The last game of that year was his last major league appearance on September 19, 1954. The final two years of Hal‚Äôs baseball career were spent back down in the minor leagues. In 1955 he played on the Los Angeles Angels (PCL) with future manager Gene Mauch. That year Hal managed to hit 25 home runs in 142 games, but he only batted .262 and struck out a lot. His Home run count put him at second place on his team next to first baseman Steve Bilko. In 1956, his final year, Hal spent his time playing on the Sacramento Solons, and within the New York Yankees farm system on the Richmond Virginians, and the Denver Bears. Between the three teams he was on, his final batting average was .218 in 116 games. He never played another professional game again after the season was over. Legacy In 1946 Rice turned in the best performance for the Rochester club that year when he drove in 9 RBIs in a game against Baltimore. Rice‚Äôs 9 RBIs equaled the Rochester RBI record Shared by Ripper Collins and George Kelly. He was the fourth Cardinals player ever to hit 2 grand slams in one season, and up until at least the late 1990s he was tied in second place with Stan Musial and other players for the most grand slams in a season.

Carroll (26 October 1954 ‚Äì 21 May 2019) was an Australian-born American painter who established a career on either side of the Atlantic. His works are held in museums around the world and he notably was included in major exhibitions such as Documenta IX and the Venice Biennale ArtForum obituary In his early career Carroll worked as an illustrator for The Progressive, The Village Voice, The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, Newsweek, The Nation, Reason, Spin, Ray Gun, and other periodicals drawing political illustrations and notably he designed the artwork for the American thrash metal band Slayer's album covers. However it is Carroll's career as a painter that is most significant. His approach to materials, to the scale and structure of the objects is highly distinctive. Early life Carroll was born to George and Mary Carroll (Gaynor) in Melbourne, Australia. He moved to Santa Monica, California, with his parents and older brother Ronald in 1958. In 1960 his family relocated to Newbury Park, a suburb located 45 minutes north of Los Angeles. He attended Newbury Park High School and later worked as a chef to pay for his studies at Moorpark Junior College and then later the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, where he studied art on a full scholarship. Career In 1984 Carroll moved to New York City from Los Angeles with his own family. In 1988 he had his first solo exhibition of his paintings at Stux Gallery in New York City. In 1989 he was invited by Harald Szeemann as one of nine young American artists to participate in Szeeman's international exhibition Einleuchten at the Deichtorhallen in Hamburg, Germany, alongside international artists such as Joseph Beuys, Bruce Nauman, Robert Ryman and others. In 1992 he was invited by Jan Hoet to participate in documenta IX in Kassel, Germany. In the early stage of his career Carroll was often invited to participate with the curatorial team of Collins & Milazzo (Tricia Collins and Richard Milazzo) in New York City. In 1994 he participated once again with Udo Kittelmann in his exhibition \\"The state of things\\" in the Kolnischer Kunstverein in Koln, Germany. Later in 1995 Carroll exhibited in the Guggenheim Museum's exhibition \\"Material Imagination\\" in New York City. In 2000 he participated in \\"Panza, legacy of a collector\\" at MOCA in Los Angeles. In 2005 he participated in 50 years of documenta, in Kassel, Germany. In 2007 and 2008 he had solo museum exhibitions at Hotel des Arts in Toulon, France, and at the Museo Correr in Venice, Italy. In 2014/15 the Bologna Museum of Modern Art (MAMbo) hosted a large survey exhibition with works from the mid-1980s to the present. Carroll exhibited widely in Europe and the United States, and is represented in the permanent collections of a number of museums and public galleries, including the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles, Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA), The Margulies Collection, Miami, Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, Jumex Collection Mexico City, MART Rovereto Italy, Panza Collection Varese, Italy, Panza Collection Sassuolo in Modena, Italy, Art Gallery of New south Wales, Sydney Australia. Stadtisches Museum Abteiberg M√∂nchengladbach Germany, Museo Cantonale d'Arte, Lugano and many other private and public collections worldwide. =Slayer= Though tangential to his practice as a painter Carroll's designs for Slayer's album covers Reign in Blood (1986), South of Heaven (1988), Seasons in the Abyss (1990) and Christ Illusion (2006) were notable. Reign in Blood's release was delayed due to the controversial cover art, though it placed in the \\"top 10 heavy metal album covers of all time\\" by Blender. Christ Illusion was banned in India for its graphic art depicting Christ mutilated with missing limbs, in a sea of blood with severed heads. =Table paintings= In the late 1990s Carroll started to explore paintings that would move away from the orthodoxy of the frame, preferring instead to make works whose form and architecture would push towards the sculptural though Carroll always regarded himself as a painter, albeit one where the works depth and dimension allowed him to insert cavities and hidden spaces into the face and sides of the painting expanding the body and narrative possibilities for the work. In 2002 Carroll created an installation in Munich, Germany for a project called \\"getting lost\\" Raum der Stille, in the Karmelitenkirche, Promenadeplatz where he included one of his first works for which he would later coin the name \\"table paintings\\". The table paintings commenced with the table (structure) which was never predetermined and was made intuitively. After the table was made Carroll then began to create the structure that grew from the table using pieces of wood from the artist's studio. Carroll thought of the structure as drawing, which could continually be altered and added to or subtracted from (erasure). The form which is connected to the table by screws was often disconnected and moved around until another form appeared that interested the artist, and at this point the structure was reconnected to the table. This process went on for months. Once a form was found Carroll often then closed one or more of the forms using newspaper and glue or cardboard. All during this process the structure and the forms were painted. More often than not the work was then completely taken apart and reassembled on the table to begin again until a form (gesture) was found that could have never been predicted. Due to this lengthy process few of these table paintings ever reached completion.

The Old Town Hall bounds the central square Marienplatz on its east side. Architecture The building, documented for the first time in 1310, had its Grand Hall (Gro√üer Saal) constructed in 1392/1394. The former Talburg Gate (Talburgtor) of the first city wall serves as spire. The Old Town Hall was re- designed in late-gothic style by J√∂rg von Halsbach 1470‚Äì1480. The Grand Hall was decorated by the Morris dancers, created by Erasmus Grasser. After alterations of the facade during the Renaissance and again in the Baroque the building was restored in neo-gothic style 1861‚Äì1864. In 1874 the municipality moved to the New Town Hall. For the passage of increased road traffic the Old Town Hall was tunneled in 1877 with a drive-through and a separate pedestrian's passage, as well as once again in 1934/35, this time finally destroying the original ground floor. During World War II the building was severely damaged and the spire was reconstructed in 1971‚Äì1974. Parts of the neo-Gothic elements, especially the statues of Ludwig the Bavarian (west facade) and Henry the Lion (east facade) and the gable design are preserved. The Grand Hall was the venue for the speech of Joseph Goebbels on November 9, 1938 which is known as the prelude for the Kristallnacht.

Although initially, it could not make the desired impact, but immediately following its reconstitution in February 2007, the ACC began working with renewed vigor and impetus duly acceding to the United Nations' convention against corruption that was adopted by the General Assembly away back on 31 October 2003. Its framework and function is governed by Anti-Corruption Commission Act, 2004. Organization The Commission has formulated some forms of corruption in Bangladesh, for everyone to know, understand and prepare to completely erase corruption, if not reduce it. * Bribery: It is the offering of money, services or other valuables to persuade someone to do something in return. Synonyms: kickbacks, baksheesh (tips), payola, hush money, sweetener, protection money, boodle, and gratuity. * Embezzlement: Taking of money, property or other valuables by the person to whom it has been entrusted for personal benefit. * Extortion: Demanding or taking of money, property or other valuables through use of coercion and/or force. A typical example of extortion would be when armed police or military men exact money for passage through a roadblock. Synonyms include blackmail, bloodsucking and extraction. * Abuse of discretion: The abuse of office for private gain, but without external inducement or extortion. Patterns of such abuses are usually associated with bureaucracies in which broad individual discretion is created, few oversights or accountability structures are present, as well as those in which decision-making rules are so complex as to neutralise the effectiveness of such structures even if they exist. * Improper political contributions: Payments made in an attempt to unduly influence present or future activities by a party or its members when they are in office. Anti Corruption Commission established district committees all over Bangladesh with each having 10 members. Notable cases * The Commission filed cases against former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia regarding graft at the Zia Charitable Trust and Zia Orphanage Trust. * The Commission filed cases against former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and eight others on 7 May 2008 for awarding a gas exploration and extraction deal to Niko Resources through corruption and abuse of power. Criticism Anti Corruption Commission was formed through an act in 2004, but is considered to be largely ineffective in investigating and preventing corruption because of governmental control over it. The Anti-Corruption Commission of Bangladesh is crippled by the 2013 amendment of the Anti Corruption Commission Act introduced by the ruling Awami League government, which makes it necessary for the commission to obtain permission from the government to investigate or file any charge against government bureaucrats or politicians. The commission is often criticised for being ineffective and a wastage of resources due to the influence of the government over it. In 2015, the ACC investigated the case of Padma Bridge Scandal. Even though the World Bank continuously pushed the government to take actions against the perpetrators, after 53 days' of investigation, ACC found nobody to be guilty.

It is native to Florida in the United States. It historically occurred in Georgia, as well, but it has been extirpated from the state.Illicium parviflorum. NatureServe. 2012. Its common names include yellow anisetree, yellow-anise, swamp star-anise,Illicium parviflorum. Flora of North America. and small anise tree.Illicium parviflorum. Missouri Botanical Garden. Description This is an evergreen shrub or tree growing up to 7 meters tall, sometimes with several trunks. The wood, foliage, and flowers are fragrant, with a scent similar to licorice. The alternately arranged leaves have leathery, oval blades up to 15 centimeters long. They are dark, shiny green on top with paler, glandular undersides. The flowers are roughly a centimeter wide and have 11 to 14 yellow-green tepals and several stamens and pistils. The fruit is a star-shaped aggregate of up to 13 follicles, each of which releases one shiny brown seed upon dehiscence. Ecology The plant grows in moist soils in several types of habitat, such as floodplains and hammocks, and near swamps and waterways. Associates include Atlantic white cypress (Chamaecyparis thyoides), Florida hobblebush (Agarista populifolia), common palmetto (Sabal palmetto), bush palmetto (Sabal minor), needle palm (Rhapidophyllum hystrix), sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana), and swampbay (Persea palustris). Conservation The plant is currently known from fewer than 20 occurrences in Central Florida, within Polk, Marion, Lake, Volusia, and Seminole Counties. It is mainly threatened by the loss of its habitat, particularly changes in local hydrology, but it is also sometimes wild- harvested for use in cultivation. Uses This plant is cultivated as a fragrant and attractive if not very showy ornamental, and can be pruned and shaped to form hedges and windbreaks. It can become very dense as roots continue to send up new shoots, and branches can root where they come in contact with the soil. It is considered easy to grow and does not have many pest problems.Gilman, E. F. Illicium parviflorum. FPS-278. Environmental Horticulture. Florida Cooperative Extension Service. University of Florida IFAS. Published 1999, revised 2007. It can sprawl up to 4.5 meters wide if not maintained. If the lower branches are removed it can be sculpted into a tree shape. It is commercially available and inexpensive.Illicium parviflorum. FloriData. The plant is poisonous and cannot be used as a spice like its congener, star anise.

He played hurling with his local club √âire √ìg and was a member of the Kilkenny senior inter-county team from the 1940s until the 1950. Biography Liam Reidy was born in Kilmacow, County Kilkenny in 1924. He was educated at the local national school and later attended the famed St. Kieran's College in Kilkenny, a virtual nursery for young hurling talent. Here Reidy began his hurling career in earnest and collected a Leinster junior colleges' championship medal with St Kieran's. Following his education Reidy was the founder of the highly successful Reidy Insurance Business on Parliament Street in Kilkenny. Playing careerClub= Reidy played his club hurling with his local √âire √ìg club and enjoyed much success. The 1940s saw √âire √ìg enjoy some great victories, with Reidy winning three county championship titles in four years. =Inter-county= Reidy first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Kilkenny minor hurling team in the early 1940s. He won a Leinster title in this grade in 1942 following a 3-10 to 0-4 defeat of Dublin, however, the subsequent All-Ireland series of games were later suspended. In 1945 Reidy was a key member of the Kilkenny senior team. That year he won his first Leinster winners' medal, however, he didn't line out in the subsequent All-Ireland final. Tipperary provided the opposition on that occasion. Almost 70,000 people packed into Croke Park to witness a classic encounter, with 5,000 more fans being locked out of the stadium. Tipp took the lead at half- time, however, Kilkenny fought back with three second-half goals. In spite of this Tipp held on to win the game by 5-6 to 3-6. Reidy missed Kilkenny's Leinster final triumph in 1946, however, he was back on the team for the All- Ireland final with Cork. The game itself pitted Cork against old rivals Kilkenny for the first time since 1939. Two quick goals just before half-time put Cork in the driving seat. Five more goals followed in the second period as Cork were the 7-5 to 3-8 winners. Reidy won a second Leinster title following a defeat of Dublin in 1947. The All-Ireland final was a repeat of the previous year as Cork and Kilkenny did battle again. In what has been described by many as the greatest hurling decider of all-time Mossy O'Riordan and Joe Kelly scored two goals that almost won the game for Cork. Kilkenny, however, fought back with Terry Leahy and Jim Langton leading the charge and eventually won the game by 'the usual point' on a score line of 0-14 to 2-7. It was Reidy's first, and only, All-Ireland winners' medal. 1950 saw Reidy win a third Leinster title. He later line dout in another All-Ireland final, however, on this occasion Tipperary won the game by a single point. Following this defeat Reidy's involvement at inter-county level ended. =Provincial= Reidy also line dout with Leinster in the inter-provincial hurling competition, however, due to Munster's domination he never won a Railway Cup medal. Retirement On taking up golf in 1951 Reidy quickly proved his skill at the game by getting his handicap down to four within a few years and by winning the club match-play championship twice in those years. He represented the club on two Barton Cup winning sides, in 1953 and 1966, and in between also played on the Provincial Towns Cup winning team in 1955. Perhaps his greatest triumph came in 1957 when he won the Waterford Glass Trophy (Scratch Cup) from an elite field. Reidy served as honorary secretary of Kilkenny Golf Club for a number of years, became captain of the club in 1970 and was honoured with the club presidency in the years 1985-86. He became the first Kilkenny member elected to the Leinster branch of the Golfing Union of Ireland (GUI) and was treasurer of the branch for some years before being elected chairman in 1987. This led to his selection as president of the GUI in 1992, a position which he filled with style and distinction. During that year Reidy presided over the third successive win for the Irish team in the Home International Championship.

It is a celebration of the time when trappers would return to the city to gather and share stories, sell their furs and antlers, and to socialize. It also commemorates the start of the Iditarod. One part of Fur Rondy is the Miners and Trappers Ball, which is a fundraiser for the Lions Club's of Alaska. The Miners and Trappers Ball has a yearly theme focused on one part of Alaskan life. The highlight of the Miners and Trappers Ball is the Mr. Fur Face beard contest. The contest is sponsored by the South central Alaska Beard and Mustache Club. Contest The Mr. Fur Face Contest continues today as one of the longest running beard contests in America. Contestants vie for the title in categories such as: * Mr. Alaskan Whaler - Beard without a mustache * Mr. Brown Bear - Brown beard * Mr. Black Bear - Black beard * Mr. Honey Bear - Blond beard * Mr. Mountain Goat - Goatee * Mr. Polar Bear - White beard * Mr. Pole Cat - Mixed color beard * Mr. Ptarmigan - Anything goes * Mr. Pyrite - Fake beard or mustache * Mr. Red Fox - Red beard * Mr. Soup Strainer - Mustache * Mr. Wolf - Trim, suave beard The categories are based primarily on facial hair color, but include categories for beard style as well. Three judges choose the winner, but ladies from the audience, affectionately known as the \\"beard fondlers\\", are eager to assist in choosing the champion. Each category has a winner and the overall title of Mr. Fur Face is given to the grand champion chosen from the best in each group. Past champions If a contestant wins the Overall Title as Mr. Fur Facehttp://archives.chicagotribune.com/2007/jan/30/image/chi-0701300020jan30 for three out of five years, then he is able to retire the main trophy and, in doing so, often retires from competing himself. Multiple year winners gain a folklorish type following among many Alaskans. The legendary champions of the contest include David Traver (4X), Robert Crawford (4X), Jim Fisher (4X), John Pex (3X), Earl Carson (3X), Larry Smith (3X), and Warren Kolb (3X). The newly crowned Mr. Fur Face also becomes the next president of the South Central Alaska Beard and Moustache Club, if he accepts the nomination. If he chooses not to take over the reins of the club, then SCAKBMC members vote for a new president as directed by the club bylaws. SCAKBMC club members have competed in the World Beard and Moustache Championships in Carson City, Nevada (2003), Berlin, Germany (2005), Brighton, England (2007), Anchorage (2009), and Trondheim, Norway in 2011.

Puquios are an ancient system of subterranean aqueducts believed to have been built by both the Paracas and Nasca cultures in the region of present-day Nazca, Peru. The former group occupied the area roughly between 800 BCE and 200 BCE, and the Nasca from 200 BCE to 650 CE 50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. near the city of Nazca, Peru. The technology of puquios is similar to that of the qanats of Iran and Makhmur, Iraq, and other ancient filtration galleries known in numerous societies in the Old World and China, which appear to have been developed independently.Ponce-Vega, p. 280 They are a sophisticated way to provide water from underground aquifers in arid regions. The Nasca also constructed the elaborate projects in this region known as the Nazca lines. Of 36 known puquios in Peru, most still function and are relied upon to bring fresh water into the desert.Proulx 1999, p. 6. The puquios first became a subject of study in the early 20th century, although they had been known before, but historic evidence was scarce. The puquios have never been fully mapped, nor excavated.Barnes 1992, p. 111. For some time, scholars disagreed on whether they were built by pre-Hispanic peoples or during the Spanish colonial era, because of a lack of evidence. Satellite imaging in the 21st century has revealed that the system was more extensive in the Nasca region than previously thought. Scholars have been able to see how the \\"puquios were distributed across the Nasca region, and where they ran in relation to nearby settlements ‚Äì which are easier to date.\\" The Italian team that conducted this study concluded in 2016 that the puquios are pre-Hispanic. In addition, RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems), or drones were used in 2016 to map and document five sample aqueduct systems in the Nazca region.  Age and makers For decades, scholars disagreed about when the aqueducts were built. Both before and after the time of the Spanish Empire, historical references to these structures has been lacking. None of the early commentators described the filtration galleries as something they observed in the region. Such galleries had long been used in Spain and other Iberian areas. Some archaeologists contend that the puquios were built by Pre-Hispanic people around 540 CE in response to two prolonged droughts during that time. The first known historical writing to refer to them was in 1605 by Reginaldo de Liz√°rraga. Some scholars believe this suggests that the works were built by the Spanish.Proulx 1999, p. 7. But none of the available Spanish texts mentions a project to build the puquios,Proulx 1999, p. 8. nor do they describe such existing water systems.David Fleming, \\"The 'Puquios' of Nazca in Peru: A Prehispanic Invention or Colonial Artifact?\\" South American Explorer, No. 34, June 1993. Retrieved on 2020-07-11 from https://www.academia.edu/14547368/The_puquios_of_Nazca In their book Irrigation and Society in the Peruvian Desert (2003) and earlier writings, Katharina Schreiber and Josue Lancho Rojas explore puquios and show evidence that these works were built by a pre-Hispanic civilization. On the other hand, Monica Barnes and David Fleming argue that Schreiber and Rojas misinterpreted evidence, presumably ignoring easier explanations for a construction in colonial times. As a result of some late 20th-century radiocarbon dating of organic materials (Bonn-1972) and accelerator mass spectrometer analysis of rock varnishes, some puquios were dated to around the 6th or 7th century CE. This is consistent with pre-Hispanic origin.  Satellite and RPAS research  Rosa Lasaponara, Nicola Masini, and their team of the Italian CNR (National Research Council), in cooperation with archaeologist Giuseppe Orefici, studied the puquios using satellite imaging in the early 21st century.Lasaponara & Masini, 2012 They found clear evidence that the puquio system must previously have been much more developed than it appears today. A series of canals was used to bring water from underground aquifers to the surface and channel it to the areas where it was needed. Excess water was stored in surface reservoirs. To help keep the water flowing, chimneys were excavated above the canals in the shape of corkscrewing funnels. These funnels admitted wind into the canals, and the difference in atmospheric pressure along the canal length forced the water through the system and eventually to the desired destination. Satellite imagery has also revealed additional, previously unknown puquios in the Nasca drainage basin.

Early life and education McLaughlin was born on July 26, 1907, in Manhattan and was raised in the Bronx. His choice to pursue architecture mirrored that of his grandfather, James W. McLaughlin, who designed the Cincinnati Art Museum. McLaughlin attended Yale University, where his thesis addressed the issues of circular design. He graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture degree in 1933 from the Yale School of Architecture.Bierut, Michael. \\"The lapel pin that changed the world\\" , Yale Arts & Culture, May / June 2007. Accessed January 4, 2008. He earned an architecture diploma from the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design in 1937. Career Tiffany & Co.'s flagship store After his graduation, despite the difficult economic climate of the Great Depression, he was able to get a position with the National Park Service in Washington, DC. That led to positions in New York City with the industrial design firm of Raymond Loewy and Walter Dorwin Teague, where he worked on the Eastman Kodak and U.S. Steel pavilions at the 1939 New York World's Fair in New York. He also designed the interior of Tiffany & Co.'s flagship store, located at Fifth Avenue and 57th Street in Manhattan, which has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. During World War II, McLaughlin worked for the Office of Strategic Services, where he worked for its leader, \\"Wild Bill\\" Donovan as chief of graphics. During the war, his group used visual design to help present information that could be easily understood, including army orientation films and cigarette packages printed with instructions for derailing German trains. His team created the design for the courtroom used in the Nuremberg Trials as well as the visual displays that were used by the prosecution that helped obtain convictions of Nazi war criminals. =United Nations insignia= Flag of the United Nations The organizers of the 1945 United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco, California, wanted an insignia that could be made into a pin to identify delegates that could also be used as a logo for the international event. U.S. Secretary of State Edward Stettinius, Jr., was chairman of the U.S. delegation and realized that a temporary design might become the permanent symbol of the United Nations. He formed a committee, headed by Oliver Lundquist, to develop a design with a world map surrounded by leaves from a design that had been created by McLaughlin. With his fellow designers, McLaughlin came up with about nine different designs. The one that they chose had to fit on a circular pin that was 1 1/16 in. in diameter, and McLaughlin referred to his thesis by shifting the projection off center so that all of the countries would fit. The continents were surrounded by olive branches to represent peace with the name, location, and date of the conference on the outer edge.Bertram, Hulen. \\"Origin of the UNO Seal\\", The New York Times, March 10, 1946.

Through its work and research efforts, Sharsheret provides healthcare resources, financial assistance, communal support, and educational programs to thousands of women and their families in the United States. Sharsheret has offices in California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey and New York. They are headquartered in Teaneck, New Jersey. Sharsheret primarily works with young women and Jewish families as Ashkenazi Jews are at higher risk of developing a BRCA gene mutation, but also aids men and women from other backgrounds.  History  Rochelle Lee Shoretz founded Sharsheret in November of 2001, when she was 28 years old, after being diagnosed with breast cancer four months earlier. Shoretz had a successful career as a lawyer after attending Columbia Law School and completed a clerkship with US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She was also a mother of two and a leader in the Jewish community. She died in 2015 at the age of 42. Shoretz' stated that her own experience with breast cancer was her inspiration for Sharsheret. While undergoing treatment, \\"she yearned to talk with a young woman like herself, someone with young children who had experienced breast cancer, someone Jewish. After a long search she found Lauryn Weiser\\". The organization pairs women diagnosed with cancer so as to offer specialized support for members and Shoretz has noted that she feels that \\"true support needs to be tailored\\", as support \\"is not just about cancer and the disease itself, but about your life with cancer\\". The Joshua Venture fellowship assisted in the founding of Sharsheret. The fellowship provided resources such as funding and mentoring to select entrepreneurs for two years. Among the first entrepreneurs selected by this program was Rochelle Lee Shoretz, which allowed her to develop Sharsheret. The organization has an On Campus division and an On Campus Leadership Training to help high school and college students understand the risks associated with breast cancer. Sharsheret is currently on 250 campuses in America, and has 12 national support and education programs. The organization also create awareness programs that include Pink Day, Pink Shabbats, Pink Challah Bakes and more.  Mission  Sharsheret, Hebrew for \\"chain\\", is an American not-for-profit intended to support young Jewish women with breast cancer, or have a genetic predisposition to it, and their families. Ashkenazi Jews make up the majority of the Jewish community in the United States and are at a higher risk of developing a BRCA gene mutation, as \\"1 in 40 women of Ashkenazi descent carry an alteration in what are referred to as the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, compared to 1 in 345 women in the general population.\\"Webinar on BRCA genetic testing Only one in 400 people in the US carry this genetic mutatin; of that amount, women carriers have an 85% chance of developing breast or ovarian cancer. Sharsheret hosts webinars and other public meetings to educate women on the benefits of genetic testing.  Activities and Events  Partnerships = Sharsheret has several national and corporate partnerships with businesses and organizations such as Pfizer, Moishe House, and 23andMe. The organization has also partnered with the sorority Alpha Epsilon Phi, which selected Sharsheret as one of its national philanthropies in 2008. = Pink Day = Starting in 2010, Sharsheret created Pink Day to raise awareness and show support for breast cancer survivors. On February 13th, people are encouraged to wear pink clothing throughout the day, as observed by many students throughout the country. Jewish student organizations such as Hillel, Chabad, and the Alpha Epsilon Phi Sorority, plan annual events in honor of Pink Day including challah bakes, \\"Pink Shabbat\\" and tabling events on campus. In 2018, over 100 schools nationwide participated in Pink Day. The schools used the Pink Day Tool Kits provided by Sharsheret. The kits include programming ideas, educational resources, physical items to display, and breast cancer awareness terminology to use in social media content.  Awards  The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has awarded Sharsheret with a five-year, $1.8 million cooperative agreement as of September of 2019, to fund the organization's \\"LINK Program-Outreach and Education Initiative\\" that works to provide educational programming and services for women under the age of 45 diagnosed with breast cancer. \\"In collaboration with the CDC and more than 100 local Sharsheret partners nationwide, we will work to serve more than 150,000 women and caregivers, enhancing the quality of life and reducing the cancer burden for breast cancer survivors, metastatic breast cancer patients and caregivers\\", said Executive Director Elana Silber in response to the award.

Lindquist is a major figure in the redirection and resurgence of woodturning in the United States beginning in the early 1970s. His communication of his ideas through teaching, writing, and exhibiting, has resulted in many of his pioneering aesthetics and techniques becoming common practice. In the exhibition catalog for a 1995 retrospective of Lindquist's works at the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, his contributions to woodturning and wood sculpture are described as \\"so profound and far-reaching that they have reconstituted the field\\". He has often been credited with being the first turner to synthesize the disparate and diverse influences of the craft field with that of the fine arts world. Early achievements Lindquist's work is characterized by an empathy with the natural aesthetics of wood, technical innovation, and art historical connections. Among his notable early achievements was the introduction of the aesthetic of Asian ceramics into American woodturning. Along with his father, wood turning pioneer Mel Lindquist, he also developed new tools and techniques that expanded the vocabulary of woodturning, and pioneered the use of spalted wood. In the early 1980s, he applied techniques he had developed for large- scale woodturning to create his massive, textured \\"Totemic Series Sculptures,\\" in the Modernist tradition of Br√¢ncu»ôi. Ichiboku series Beginning in 1985, Lindquist created his \\"Ichiboku series\\" sculptures: six- to eight-foot-tall () sculptures from a single block of wood, applying the philosophy and techniques of ninth century Japanese Buddhist woodcarving to the formal concepts of Modernism. Unlike his earlier works, woodturning was not the primary method for their creation. These sculptures were exhibited in 1990 along with seven other influential sculptors of the decade (including Raoul Hague and Ursula von Rydingsvard). Lindquist's \\"Ichiboku\\" sculptures distinguished themselves from others in the exhibition, and from the work of most wood artists of the time, by their identification with the spirit of the tree, a concept he adopted from the Japanese. Rather than imposing an external idea upon the wood, he \\"was engaged in a dialogue with trees\\"; this approach was antithetical to the mainstream of 20th-century art, which was intellectually removed from the appreciation of nature. Public collections Lindquist's work can be found on permanent display in many American museums and public collections including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City, the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum, San Francisco, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington D.C., Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Yale University Art Gallery and the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Armstrong reported that when she began work on High Tide she pinned a note above her desk: \\"Blood ties. Water. Running Away.\\" Jan Adele plays Lilli's mother-in-law Bet, in her film debut. Plot introduction Two-time Academy Award nominee Judy Davis (Sybylla in My Brilliant Career, Adela Quested in A Passage to India) plays Lili, a back-up singer for an Elvis Presley impersonator, who lives on the edge of show business. She is stranded in a small coastal town and befriends teenager Ally (Claudia Karvan) without knowing she is the daughter left behind as an infant after her husband's sudden death. Synopsis Lilli is one of three backing singers for a touring Elvis impersonator until she is fired. Then, left alone at the beginning of winter she is stranded in a ramshackle beach town on the windswept coast of New South Wales. This remote, working class, tourist-town has a pervasive sense of rootlessness and movement. The people survive by changing their occupations with the seasons and work hard in small businesses. Here, stuck in the Mermaid Caravan Park, she encounters her teenage daughter Ally (Claudia Karvan). When Lilli's young surfer husband had died, she felt lost; she gave up her baby to her mother-in-law, Bet. Lilli has been drifting ever since, and getting wasted. Bet is a rowdy, belligerent woman, devoted to Ally‚Äîshe has taken care of her for 13 years but she has no idea how unhappy the girl is. Lilli has an immediate rapport with the lonely Ally even before she knows that Ally is her daughter, and after she knows, she can't take her eyes off her. They belong with each other. but Lilli's terrified of taking on the responsibilities of motherhood, and Bet tells her she's riff-raff. When we first see Ally she is in the water; surfing is‚Äî\\"her refuge from the noisy junkiness of life with Bet. Bet isn't a monster, she's simply the wrong person to be raising the pensive Ally, whose emotions are hidden away, like her mother's. The drama is in our feeling that Lilli must not leave her daughter in the embrace of this raucous old trouper.\\"Pauline Kael, Hooked Cast *Judy Davis as Lillie *Jan Adele as Bet *Claudia Karvan as Ally *Frankie J.

But then Armstrong went to see Wrong World at the cinema, which was about a male drifter, and the more she thought about the more she felt there had been plenty of films about a man being reunited with their child such as Paper Moon and Paris Texas.\\"Interview with Gillian Armstrong\\", Signet, 4 September 1998 accessed 17 November 2012 Her husband suggested she change the character to a woman, which would not only be different but give the film a harder edge. Armstrong was reluctant as she did not want to make another film about a woman, but eventually changed her mind. Jones and Levy agreed with the choice.David Stratton, The Avocado Plantation: Boom and Bust in the Australian Film Industry, Pan MacMillan, 1990 p366-368 Judy Davis was approached even before the film was rewritten and she was involved in further drafts.

(also known as Talent Associates-Paramount, Ltd. and Talent Associates-Norton Simon, Inc.), was a production company headed by David Susskind, later joined by Daniel Melnick, Leonard Stern and Ron Gilbert. Origins In the years after World War II, Susskind was a talent agent for Century Artists, ultimately ending up in the powerhouse Music Corporation of America's fairly newly minted television program department, managing Dinah Shore, Jerry Lewis, and others. He then went to New York and formed Talent Associates, representing creators of material rather than performers. Susskind converted Talent Associates into a packaging company for new programs in 1952. Golden Age television Talent Associates produced some of the classic series of the Golden Age of Television, such as the Wally Cox comedy Mister Peepers, the anthology teleplay series The Goodyear Television Playhouse/The Philco Television Playhouse and Armstrong Circle Theatre. In 1953-54, Talent Associates produced Jamie starring a young Brandon deWilde, fresh off his success in George Stevens' Shane (1953), for ABC. De Wilde together with veteran character actor Ernest Truex, told the story of aging Grandpa McHummer striking a bond with young Jamie, his recently orphaned grandson. Talent Associates was structured like a small, family-run firm; Susskind deliberately chose young and inexperienced associates, many of them women, who would learn on the job. Expansion Susskind began to branch out, putting together Broadway shows (‚ÄúMr. Lincoln‚Äù) and feature films (A Raisin in the Sun). Talent Associates won more than 20 Emmy awards in the 1960s and 1970s. A few key projects to note: =Open End/The David Susskind Show= In 1958, Susskind became the host of Open End, one of the first major TV talk shows. The title refers to the irregular run time - guests would talk until they had nothing left to say.Bowie, Stephen classictvhistory.com Retrieved July 20, 2015 Open End ended in 1966, but was replaced by the fixed length The David Susskind Show. =East Side/West Side= By 1963, Susskind had a reputation as a maverick, one of the last producers willing to stand up to the ever more powerful TV networks; his East Side/West Side, a hard-hitting dramatic series starring George C. Scott, began on CBS in 1963 and won fairly high critical praise. In an era when race relations was a volatile subject in the United States, East Side/West Side featured Cicely Tyson in one of the first major regular roles for an African-American actress in a primetime drama, and the series dealt a few times with issues facing African-Americans, as well as other urban issues such as drug addiction and abortion, leading to some affiliates in Southern states not clearing the program. East Side/West Side also had trouble attracting advertisers. The drama was canceled by CBS after only one season, due also in large part with CBS programming head James Aubrey's discomfort with the socially conscious subject matter, as well as Aubrey's conflicts with Scott and Susskind over the direction of the series.Bowie, Stephen classictvhistory.com Retrieved July 20, 2015 David Susskind appears as himself in one episode, hosting a television discussion. =Get Smart= While East Side/West Side was in production, two young writers, Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, were working at Talent Associates in New York City on the script for a new pilot, which became an enduring legacy of Talent Associates. This was the sitcom Get Smart, a spoof of the then-popular secret agent genre, which premiered in 1965 on NBC and starred Don Adams and Barbara Feldon. Production took place at Sunset Bronson Studios in Hollywood, so Talent Associates had to establish a West Coast presence. Get Smart spanned 138 episodes over 5 years, and was very popular in broadcast syndication. It spawned sequels, reunion shows and even major feature films decades after its premiere. =Other= Talent Associates continued with television and motion picture projects, including producing duties on Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, the 1974 film, and McMillan & Wife, the 1971-1977 TV series. The company also ventured into game shows, packaging the original version of Supermarket Sweep, and its successor The Honeymoon Race; as well as The Generation Gap; and an unsold pilot, King of the Hill. Record division Talent Associates also had a short lived record division, known as TA Records, which released a total of only 4 LP titles.TA Records discography The label's product was distributed through Bell Records. The soft rock duo Seals and Crofts were signed to the label in 1969. After releasing two albums which received little attention the group moved to Warner Bros. Records in 1971 where they recorded a string of hit albums and singles during the mid-1970s. Another TA Records group, The Original Caste, reached #34 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart with the original recording of \\"One Tin Soldier\\" in 1970. Ownership changes From 1961 to 1965, Paramount Pictures owned a 50% stake in Talent Associates. In August 1968, the company was acquired by industrialist Norton Simon, \\"Help Help From a Big Brother\\", Time, August 30, 1968. becoming known as Talent Associates-Norton Simon, Inc. until 1974, when Susskind and Gilbert bought it back.

Pakistani law is based upon the legal system of British India; thus ultimately on the common law of England and Wales. History Upon the list of the Dominion of Pakistan in 1947 the laws of the erstwhile British Raj remained in force. At no point in Pakistan's legal history was there an intention to begin the statute book afresh. The founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah had a vision regarding the law of Pakistan, to implement a system in accordance to Islamic teachings, it was fulfilled to some how in 1960's and 1980's in Ayubs and Zia Regime by implementing islamic laws . This vision, however, did have a lasting effect on later Pakistani lawmakers. During the reign of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, elements of Islamic Sharia law were incorporated into Pakistani law, leading to the institution of a Federal Shariat Court (FSC). In some Federally and Provincially Administered Tribal Areas [(FATA) and (PATA)], a system of law employing traditional methods, which persists at the local level. At this informal level, disputes are settled by a jirga, a council of tribal elders. Influences The political ideology was largely sculpted by the likes of individuals such as Muhammad Ali Jinnah the founder of Pakistan- while . It was the influence of British rules over subcontinent which influences that led to the Pakistani common law being based upon the common law of England and Wales. Muhammad Ali Jinnah took on the role as titular figurehead of Pakistani politics and as a result Pakistan is now a common law system, with an adversarial court procedure and follows other common law practices such as judicial precedent and the concept of stare decision . However Pakistan differs from the classic common law in many ways. Firstly both the criminal and civil laws are almost completely codified, a legacy from the days of the British Raj, when English laws were extended to India by ways of statute. Jury trials have been phased out in Pakistan since independence, because of judicial and public dissatisfaction with their operation; one Pakistani judge called jury trials as \\"amateur justice\\". In constitutional law matters Pakistani jurisprudence has been greatly influenced by the United States legal system, Pakistan has adopted a US-style Federal Structure. Islamic law and traditional jirga-based law has also influenced the country's judicial development... Many of the British Laws Adapted through Adaptation Acts of 1947, 1957.

It refers to carrying out exercises that bring about the physical sensations of a panic attack, such as hyperventilation and high muscle tension, and in the process removing the patient's conditioned response that the physical sensations will cause an attack to happen. Description By removing the fear of a panic attack happening whenever the person is exposed to a stimulus that has become a precursor to the attack, interoceptive exposure lessens the occurrences of attacks in patients who have received treatment. In short, interoceptive exposure seeks to remove the \\"fear of fear\\", where the attacks happen because of the fear of actually having an attack. Interoceptive exposure can be contrasted with in vivo exposure, which exposes the person directly to a feared situation. Interoceptive exposure can be used as a means to induce depersonalization and derealization.  History  Behavioral therapy began primarily between 1950 and 1970 by researchers in the United States, United Kingdom, and South Africa. Joseph Wolpe pioneered the method of systematic desensitization, which started the search for fear reduction techniques. Reiss and McNally developed an expectancy model of fear in 1985 based on the concept of \\"fear of fear,\\" which they called anxiety sensitivity. They were some of the first researchers to begin examining how anxiety sensitivity influences panic disorder. This theory postulates that individuals with high anxiety sensitivity tend to believe that anxiety causes mental illness, leads to heart attacks, or produces more anxiety. Early experiments in the 1990s yielded mixed results on the effectiveness of interoceptive exposure. Throughout the 21st century, scientists began to create treatment protocol to help those with Panic Disorder. Barlow and Craske (2007) constructed a popular treatment procedure in which therapists use a low dose of IE therapy along with controlled breathing skills. However, scientists still question whether a low-dose IE therapy or a more intensive approach is more effective. Specific applications Post traumatic stress disorder and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, conditions commonly comorbid with Panic Disorder, can be treated using interoceptive exposures. IE has been shown to reduce Anxiety Sensitivity, the main characteristic of those with Panic Disorder, which is also associated with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Social Phobia. Post traumatic stress disorder It is postulated that IE helps those with PTSD because many of the exercises serve as reminders of the individual's traumatic experiences. IE creates high anxiety reactions for those with PTSD and reduces their anxiety sensitivity for future encounters to the traumatic event. For example, a spinning exercise could make some individuals remember spinning in their vehicle after being hit. Also, after completing a tension exercise, individuals may remember a time when they were physically hit in some way (e.g. physical assault, recreational accident, road traffic collision). These exercises can make some individuals feel distressed from the recall of trauma. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Panic disorder has been found to commonly co-occur with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a serious lung disease that involves restriction of airways from chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema. Research suggests that IE breathing exercises are safe and similar to the existing exercises that are used to help COPD. CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) is not commonly used to help treat COPD, but recent research has shown that CBT including interoceptive exposures could be extremely beneficial. Specifically, IE extinguishes the learned fear response paired with breathing difficulties and disconfirms the catastrophic cognitions connected with increased physiological arousal. Anxiety sensitivity Researchers reported high degrees of anxiety sensitivity in patients with GAD, social phobia, and panic disorder. This led researchers to believe that there may be alternative treatment options involving IE therapy that would benefit these individuals. For example, for those with GAD, caffeine could be administered to make thoughts race and provoke worry about loss of cognitive control. Also individuals with social phobia could induce sweating before doing a speech challenge. Acknowledging these physical symptoms associated with high anxiety may be beneficial in reducing future anxiety when it does occur.  Implementation differences  Treatment manuals for IE are not consistent in how the therapy should be implemented. Despite minimal reports of adverse outcomes due to IE from both patients and therapists, therapists have been cautious when applying interoceptive exposure and have tended to implement it in a less prolonged and intense fashion than treatment manuals suggest.

Early life and education Ogilvie was born in Monymusk, Aberdeenshire in 1864, the eldest daughter of Maria Matilda Nichol and Reverend Alexander Ogilvie, LL.D., headmaster of Robert Gordons College. She had five brothers and two sisters. Her eldest brother, Francis Grant Ogilvie, was also a scientist and director of the London Science Museum. At the age of nine she went to the Merchant Company Edinburgh Ladies' College where she remained for nine years, becoming both head girl and the best academic pupil. At the age of 18 she went to the Royal Academy of Music in London where she studied piano. However, she left within a year to start a Bachelor of Science at Heriot-Watt College. She completed her degree, specialising in geology, botany and zoology, in 1890 at University College London. In 1891, she traveled to Germany to continue her studies at Berlin University. She was refused admission as women were not admitted to higher education institutions at the time in Germany, this despite the efforts of several influential friends and colleagues, including geologist Baron Ferdinand von Richthofen She accompanied von Richthofen and his wife to Munich where she studied with Karl von Zittel and Richard von Hertwig and carried out research. In July 1891, the Richthofens travelled to the Dolomites for five weeks, inviting Ogilvie to go with them. It was in the Dolomites with Richthofen that she began to focus her work on geology. In 1893 she was awarded the Doctor of Science in Geology from the University of London and was the first woman to receive this degree. In 1900, she and Agnes Kelly became the first women to be awarded a PhD from the University of Munich, receiving a distinction in the fields of geology, palaeontology and zoology. Research All of Maria Gordon's geological research was carried out in the South Tyrol, an area of the Italian Alps close to the border with Austria. This area of the Alps is part of the geologically-complex Dolomites. The Dolomites are a very distinct range of mountains, characterised by high, dramatic peaks, which were thought to have been formed from the remains of coral atolls in an ancient sea. Gordon challenged this idea with her theory of 'crust-torsion', the notion that the mountains had been formed by the pushing, twisting and folding of the earth's crust. Through observation and measurement of the geological structures in the Dolomites, she was able to determine that there were two phases of folding and structural deformation, leading to a new interpretation of the tectonic structure of the Alps.Ogilvie Gordon, M. M. 1927. Das Gr√∂dener, Fassa und Ennerberggebiet in den S√ºdtiroler Dolomiten, Geologische Beschreibung mit besonderer Ber√ºcksichtigung der Ueberschiebungscheinungen. Abhandlungen der Geologischen Bundesanstalt Wien, Vol. 24, fasc. 1&2. In total, she wrote more than 30 papers based on her research and findings in this region, some of which are considered seminal works. Her biographer described her as \\"probably the most productive woman field geologist of any country in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\\" Politics May Ogilvie Gordon She was active in politics as a Liberal and an advocate of Women's Rights. On 8 February 1922 she was selected as prospective parliamentary candidate for the Lloyd George supporting National Liberals at the Canterbury constituency.Aberdeen Journal, 9 February 1922 A General Election was called for November 1922 but on 3 November, she withdrew. Following Liberal re-union between Lloyd George and H. H. Asquith she contested the 1923 General Election as Liberal candidate for the Unionist seat of Hastings, pushing the Labour candidate into third place; As an advocate of women's rights, she served as Vice President of the International Council of Women, Honorary President of the Associated Women's Friendly Society and the National Women's Citizens Association, and also as President of the National Council of Women of Great Britain and Ireland. She played an important part in the post-World War 1 negotiations at the Council for the Representation of Women in the League of Nations. In 2000 to commemorate her contributions to palaeontology, a new fossilised fern genus Gordonopteris Iorigae was named after her. It was discovered in the Triassic sediments of the Dolomites. A room at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich's library, the Maria-Ogilvie-Gordon-Raum, is named in her honour. It houses the map collection of the department of geology.

Shankar is a right-handed batsman and occasional off-spin bowler. He was born at Ascot, Berkshire and educated at Bedford School during his childhood. Spending the majority of his career on the fringes of county cricket, Shankar became embroiled in controversy in 2011 when he was released by Worcestershire County Cricket Club, having been discovered to have lied about his age and achievements in order to gain a professional contract.https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/adrian-shankar-cricket-conman-989 Early career After leaving Bedford School, where he had played cricket for the school alongside Alastair Cook, following his A Levels in 2000, Shankar proceeded to read law at Cambridge University. It was for the university cricket club that he made his first-class debut against Middlesex in 2002. Shankar played first-class cricket for the university from 2002 to 2005, playing his final first-class match against Oxford University, while on occasion he captained the university. Shankar played 12 first-class matches for the University, scoring 384 runs at an average of 27.42. His one innings of note came against Oxford University in 2002, when he scored 143 runs from 297 balls, before being dismissed by Stephen Hawinkels. This was Shankar's only first-class century and was the only time he passed fifty. The bowling in the match was later described by Cambridge University coach Chris Scott as \\"utterly bad\\". Shankar made his debut for Bedfordshire while still at Bedford School, making his debut against Norfolk in the 2000 Minor Counties Championship. Between 2000 and 2006, Shankar played infrequently for Bedfordshire, making 21 Minor Counties Championship appearances and 2 MCCA Knockout Trophy appearances, which came in 2006. It was for Bedfordshire that he made his List A debut, against Sussex in the 2005 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy at Wardown Park. He was dismissed in this match by Jason Lewry for 27 runs, which was the second highest score in Bedfordshire's innings. During this period, he played Second XI cricket for the Middlesex Second XI, Worcestershire Second XI and Sussex Second XI. However his career was interrupted for 18 months when he suffered from glandular fever. After representing the Lancashire Second XI in 2008, Shankar was given a two-year contract with Lancashire. Lancashire cricket coach, Mike Watkinson, stated \\"Adrian is a quality young batsman who fills a gap in our player development programme. He has attracted interest from a number of other counties which confirms his potential\\". While on the Lancashire staff, Shankar chose to study part-time for a two-year masters course in international relations, also at Cambridge. It fitted in with Shankar's ambition to play cricket for Lancashire as the course required that he only had to be in Cambridge for six weeks of the year. However, Shankar failed to impress and did not play for Lancashire's first team. Worcestershire While supposedly playing cricket in Sri Lanka in the \\"Sri Lankan Mercantile League\\" (later discovered to be a fictional competition likely invented by Shankar himself) he came to the attention of Worcestershire, and he signed a contract with the injury hit club in May 2011. Shankar was put straight into the Worcestershire first team, making his debut for the county in the Clydesdale Bank 40 against Middlesex, in what would be his only List A appearance for the team. In this match he opened the batting with Moeen Ali, but was dismissed for a duck by Tim Murtagh. He made a single first-class appearance for the county, which came against Durham. He scored 10 unbeaten runs in Worcestershire's first-innings, before retiring hurt with a strained cruciate ligament which was set to rule him out for six weeks. Two weeks after signing for his new county, his claims that he was three years younger than his actual age and that he had enjoyed a successful season playing high level cricket in Sri Lanka turned out to be false. Shankar was immediately released from his contract. The cricket he played in Sri Lanka was played at a minor level, with scorecards of the series not appearing on respected archiving websites such as CricketArchive and Cricinfo, a fact it appears Worcestershire failed to check. In light of this, the England and Wales Cricket Board asked Bedfordshire, for whom he was still registered to play Minor counties cricket, to remove him from their list of eligible players. Worcestershire also passed his registration documents to West Mercia Police, who later decided not to pursue criminal charges. Shankar's deception had begun at Lancashire, with Shankar claiming his age was 23. Upon his signing with the county, Lancashire released a press statement which stated the Cambridge University coach referring to him as one of the finest young players the university side had seen since John Crawley. Chris Scott contacted Lancashire to deny having made such a claim, saying \\"I phoned Lancashire and made it clear that I'd never said anything of the sort\\", before going on to say \\"He was a poor player and there's no way I would have recommended him.\\" In response to the situation, Bedfordshire president Mike Green had to say \\"Frankly we [Bedfordshire] were amazed when we found out he was signing for Worcestershire because he would have struggled to get into our side. He hadn‚Äôt been good enough to get into our first XI for a good six or seven years.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:English cricketers Category:People from Ascot, Berkshire Category:People educated at Bedford School Category:Alumni of the University of Cambridge Category:Bedfordshire cricketers Category:Cambridge MCCU cricketers Category:Cambridge University cricketers Category:Cambridge University cricket captains Category:Worcestershire cricketers Category:Impostors ","title":"Adrian Shankar"},{"id":"20952411","text":"Richard Hellings (1 December 1874 ‚Äì 9 February 1938)Dick Hellings player profile Scrum.com was an English-born Welsh rugby union forward who played international rugby for WalesWelsh Rugby Union player profiles and club rugby for Llwynypia.

This saw the emergence of the 'Rhondda forward', manual workers chosen from the villages and towns of the south Wales valleys.Smith (1980), pg 92. In 1897 Hellings was chosen to face England as part of the 1897 Home Nations Championship along with fellow Rhondda players, Jack Rhapps and Dai Evans.

The route connects SR-126 and I-15 to US-89 and SR-203 as it passes through the center of Ogden on Hinckley Drive and portions of 30th and 31st Streets. The highway was formed in 1957, initially routed from SR-38 (then running on Pennsylvania Avenue) east to SR-204 (Wall Avenue). It was subsequently extended west to SR-126 and east to Harrison Boulevard (SR-203), before being extended west again to SR-108. Route description SR-79 begins at an intersection with SR-108 in West Haven and proceeds east on Hinckley Drive, with two lanes in each direction separated by a center turn lane. It climbs a hill and crosses the former alignment of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, entering the city limits of Roy. It then crosses the Union Pacific and FrontRunner railroad tracks on a bridge more than long; the girders on this bridge were the largest steel girders ever installed in Utah on a non-freeway project. SR-79 then comes to a junction with SR-126 (1900 West) and enters the city limits of Ogden. The highway turns slightly to northeast on Hinckley Drive and gains a center median, straddling the northern periphery of Ogden-Hinckley Airport. Before intersecting 1325 West the road loses division of its lanes. Passing the intersection of Pennsylvania Avenue the road turns east, gains a lane in each direction and intersects at a diamond interchange with I-15. Past Parker Drive the road again briefly turns northeast and climbs onto a viaduct over railroad tracks. The termination of the viaduct begins the one-way pair of SR-79, with 30th Street forming the westbound segment and 31st Street the eastbound segment. The pair continues for until reaching Washington Boulevard (US-89), where 31st Street loses state maintenance and SR-79 continues on 30th Street, now a two-way street. The two- lane highway continues east until reaching Harrison Boulevard (SR-203), where SR-79 ends. The portion of the route east of I-15 is included in the National Highway System. History State Route 79 was established on May 14, 1957, then traveling from Pennsylvania Avenue (at that time SR-38) northeast to Wall Avenue (SR-204). In 1958, the route was extended east to Washington Boulevard (US-91, now US-89) via 31st and Patterson Streets (the latter located in between 31st and 30th Streets). In 1966 a portion of SR-38 between SR-84 (now SR-126) was transferred to SR-79. In 1970 a portion of 30th Street between US-91 and SR-203 was relinquished by Ogden and the state assumed responsibility. By 1979 Patterson Avenue was given back to the city and in 1994 30th Street between Washington Boulevard west to 31st Street became the westbound segment of SR-79. In fall 2009, over eight years after it had been first proposed, construction began on an extension of Hinckley Drive west to Midland Drive (SR-108). The road opened in August 2010, and SR-79 was extended to its current terminus at that time.

Co- editing the magazine with Lore were Louis C. Fraina, a former member of the Socialist Labor Party and voluminous writer on themes relating to the European revolutionary movement, and Louis Boudin, a well known Marxist theoretician. Another regular publication loyal to the left-wing was International Socialist Review published by Charles H. Kerr. A Socialist Propaganda League of America had been formed in Boston and by late 1918 had succeeded in taking over the Boston local. The Boston newspaper, The Revolutionary Age became the major voice of the Left wing in late 1918 and early 1919. =Formation of the Left Wing Section= In New York a specific Left wing group within the party had been formed in February 1919, and began publishing the New York Communist.Theodore Draper, The Roots of American Communism. New York: Viking Press, 1959; pp. 144‚Äì145. After the National Executive Committee voided the election returns to a new National Executive Committee, which would have a left majority, and expelled several Left Wing locals and federations in May 1919, the Leftist groups decided to meet in a conference in late June.Draper, The Roots of American Communism, pp. 137‚Äì158. At the conference however, there was still much dissension. The seven expelled federations and the Michigan party demanded that the Left wing go ahead and form a communist party, while the group around the Revolutionary Age still wanted to try to take over the Socialist party at its September convention. The Federations and the Michigan group walked out and formed a National Organization Committee, which was set on organizing a founding Communist convention to rival the socialist convention in September. They also began publishing their own newspaper, The Communist.Draper, The Roots of American Communism, pp. 166‚Äì167, 173. =The Left Wing National Council= John Reed and Ben Gitlow's Left Wing magazine Voice of Labor was later made the labor paper of the Communist Labor Party. The majority founded the National Council of the Left Wing and planned to take retake the socialist organization and convention. The council members included Louis Fraina, C. E. Ruthenberg, I. E. Ferguson, John Ballam, James Larkin, Eadmon MacAlpine, Benjamin Gitlow, Maximilian Cohen, and Bertram Wolfe. Ferguson was named national secretary and the Revolutionary Age, with Fraina as editor, became the official organ.Draper, The Roots of American Communism, pp. 166‚Äì168. The left wingers who had been elected to the new NEC but had been purged by the old NEC in May held a rump meeting in Chicago, on July 26-27 tabulating the votes for themselves and asking the national secretary, Adolph Germer, to had over the keys to the party headquarters. They were rebuffed. On July 28 the National council of the Left wing gave in and voted to attend the Chicago convention organized by the National Organizing Committee to form the Communist Party of America. Three members of the National Council, however, Gitlow, Larkin and MacAlpine, were adamantly opposed to this. They, together with John Reed and Alfred Wagnknecht, formed a new faction, the Labor Committee of the Left Wing with a new organ, the Voice of Labor.Draper, The Roots of American Communism, pp. 174‚Äì175. =The Emergency National Convention of 1919= At the August 31 opening of the Socialist party convention the Reed-Gitlow group tried to enter and present their credentials, but were promptly thrown out of the hall with the help of the police. The Left Wingers, joined by other socialist delegates who walked out of the convention in protest over the incident or for other disagreements with the socialist party, including the entire Ohio delegation, then met in the billiards room on the first floor of the Machinists Hall in Chicago and formed the Communist Labor Party.

Weitzenhoffer & Erickson Weitzenhoffer and Milton Erickson were friends and at times collaborators, with a mutual respect for each other's work. However, Weitzenhoffer was critical of certain aspects of Erickson's theory and practice, and especially critical of those who subsequently claimed to represent Erickson's views. > We were, I think, good friends even though separated by a considerable age > difference, and had a mutual high respect for each other as professionals. > As associate editor of the American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis for some > years, I worked closely with him in its publication.

Sandleford was a priory of Austin canons, founded between 1193 and 1202 by Geoffrey, 4th count of Perch, and Richenza-Matilda his wife. A confirmation charter from Archbishop Stephen indicates the priory was dedicated to St John the Baptist and endowed with all the lands of Sandleford. The appropriation of the priory, on 9 March 1478, to the Dean and Canons of Windsor was mainly owing to Bishop Beauchamp of Salisbury, who was Dean of Windsor from 1478 to 1481. By this time it appears the religious had forsaken the priory. The chapel of Sandleford Priory (1200‚Äì1478) was incorporated into a later country house.

Definition Let \\\\mathcal{F} be a sheaf on a topological space X. Choose an open cover \\\\mathfrak{U} of X. That is, \\\\mathfrak{U} is a set of open subsets of X which together cover X. Let \\\\mathcal{H}^q(X, \\\\mathcal{F}) denote the presheaf which takes an open set U to the qth cohomology of \\\\mathcal{F} on U, that is, to H^q(U, \\\\mathcal{F}).

If for all finite intersections of a covering the cohomology vanishes, the E2-term degenerates and the edge morphisms yield an isomorphism of ƒåech cohomology for this covering to sheaf cohomology.

For instance, this happens if \\\\mathcal{F} is a quasi-coherent sheaf on a scheme and each element of \\\\mathfrak{U} is an open affine subscheme such that all finite intersections are again affine (e.g. if the scheme is separated).

He studied at Dartmouth College and briefly at Columbia Law School. Before finishing law school he dropped out to write a novel and later found his way into the advertising industry. Koenig served four years in the United States Army Air Forces, 1942‚Äì1946. In 1946, Julian became half owner of a semi-pro baseball team, the Yonkers Indians, with his friend, writer Eliot Asinof. The team went bankrupt during its second season under their ownership, in part because there were no women's bathrooms at the Indians' ball park. Julian Koenig's older brother was Lester Koenig, a screenwriter, film producer, and the founder of the jazz record label, Contemporary Records. Career Koenig originated many famous advertising campaigns. While working at the advertising firm Hirshon Garfield he designed the Timex torture test commercials which featured the tagline \\"Timex: It takes a licking and keeps on ticking\\". At the firm DDB, he and Helmut Krone created the legendary \\"Think Small\\" and \\"Lemon\\" ads for Volkswagen under the supervision of William Bernbach. The \\"Think Small\\" ad was voted the No. 1 campaign of all time in Advertising Age's 1999 ‚ÄúThe Century of Advertising.\\" In 1960, Frederic S. Papert, an account manager from Kenyon & Eckhardt, persuaded Koenig and George Lois to start up their own creative hot shop, PKL. In 1962, they broke an industry taboo by doing an IPO. Within years several other agencies followed their lead. Koenig was on Senator Gaylord Nelson's 1969 committee that established Earth Day on April 22. Koenig coined the name \\"Earth Day\\". Koenig later stated that he was inspired by the fact that ‚ÄúEarth Day‚Äù rhymes with ‚Äúbirthday‚Äù (April 22nd was also Koenig‚Äôs birthday). Denis Hayes, the environmental activist who coordinated the first Earth Day, recounts Koenig's involvement: In 1970, copywriter Jerry Della Femina wrote of Koenig: Personal life Koenig was married twice. His first wife was Aquila Wilson Connolly.

Function Cytoplasmic ribosomes, organelles that catalyze protein synthesis, consist of a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit. Together these subunits are composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 structurally distinct proteins. This gene encodes ribosomal protein S4, a component of the 40S subunit. Ribosomal protein S4 is the only ribosomal protein known to be encoded by more than one gene, namely this gene, RPS4Y1 and the ribosomal protein S4, X-linked (RPS4X). The 3 isoforms encoded by these genes are not identical, but appear to be functionally equivalent. Ribosomal protein S4 belongs to the S4E family of ribosomal proteins. It has been suggested that haploinsufficiency of the ribosomal protein S4 genes plays a role in Turner syndrome; however, this hypothesis is controversial.

The song, which has been translated into several languages, has become so popular in some countries that it is erroneously considered to be a locally written song. It was composed during the reign of caudillo Franco in Spain and is a call for unity of action to achieve freedom. The song has become a symbol of the fight for freedom everywhere. Polish singer-songwriter Jacek Kaczmarski was inspired to write new lyrics to the melody of L'Estaca after hearing the song on one of several Spanish records he borrowed from a friend in December 1978. The result was Mury, which became one of his most famous compositions after it was adopted by the Polish trade union Solidarno≈õƒá and sung at countless rallies, meetings, protests and strikes throughout Poland during the 1980s. Later, a Belarusian language adaptation of the Polish version became a symbol of the 2020 Belarusian protests. Lakadjina and Yasser Jeradi made a version of the song that became the anthem of the Tunisian Revolution in 2011 L'Estaca is also an anthem for the supporters of the rugby team USAP, of Perpignan in Northern Catalonia, in France. The song was covered in Yiddish (under the title \\"Der Yokh\\") by the American klezmer band, The Klezmatics, in their 2016 album Apikorsim. The song was also sung in Bilbao in Basque on September 16, 2017 in support of Catalonia's Referendum on Independence scheduled for October 1, 2017 before a crowd of 32,000.  Lyrics  The lyrics describe the struggle for freedom using a metaphor of being tied to a stake. The song is a conversation held in a doorway at dawn, where the main character asks Grandfather Siset \\"Don't you see the stake that we're all tied to? If we can't take it down, we'll never be able to walk.\\" and the old man tells him that the only way to get free is by working together: \\"If we all pull, it will fall down. If I pull this way and you pull that way, it will surely fall, fall, fall, and we will be able to liberate ourselves.\\" The struggle for freedom is hard, it is never over, there is no rest. Llach says that when he originally composed the song, he used the word 'column' instead of 'stake'.

At the ceremony, the Dutch minister gave a speech and in his words, \\"Shortly after the war, your support for Indonesia's right to self-determination and your film Indonesia Calling brought you into conflict with the Dutch government [‚Ä¶] I can now say that history has come down more on your side than on the side of your adversaries.\\" References * *Hans Schoots, Living Dangerously: A Biography of Joris Ivens (Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 2000) External links * * sensesofcinema.com: From Colonial Film Commissioner to Political Pariah: Joris Ivens and the Making of Indonesia Calling by Drew Cottle and Angela Keys *'Indonesia Calling: Joris Ivens In Australia', ABC Arts, Friday 3 December, 2010 * Indonesia Calling at National Film and Sound Archive *Ivens.nl 'Indonesia Calling', The Legacy of Joris Ivens *'Joris Ivens' historic short film: Indonesia Calling' Jakarta Post, 16 August 2009 *Indonesia Calling at Oz Movies Category:1946 documentary films Category:Black-and-white documentary films Category:1946 films Category:Australian documentary films Category:Australian films Category:Australian short films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Joris Ivens Category:Films about the Indonesian National Revolution Category:Short documentary films Category:Films shot in Sydney Category:Documentary films about Indonesia Category:Australian black-and-white films ","title":"Indonesia Calling"},{"id":"20952795","text":"U.S. Route 24 (US 24) is a part of the U.S. Highway System that travels from Minturn, Colorado, to Clarkston, Michigan.

Route descriptionRocky Mountain National Park to Boulder= US 34 approaching the western endpoint of US 36 at Deer Ridge Junction in Rocky Mountain National Park. U.S. Highway 36 begins at Deer Ridge Junction in Rocky Mountain National Park, where it intersects U.S. Highway 34 (Trail Ridge Road) on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains. It exits the park at the Beaver Meadows Visitor Center and enters the town of Estes Park, where it is briefly overlapped with Business US 34 until it meets (but does not cross) the main US 34 again at an intersection shaped like the letter K. On its way out of Estes Park it intersects SH 7 at South St. Vrain Avenue, for the first of three times. It then descends southeast through North St. Vrain Canyon to the town of Lyons, which it enters on Main Street. At 5th Avenue in Lyons, it intersects SH 7 again, beginning an overlap to Boulder which is signed only as US 36. At 5th Avenue and Main Street in Lyons, it divides into a pair of one- way streets with the eastbound direction traveling one block south on 5th Avenue and turning east onto Broadway Street, and the westbound direction using Main Street. The two directions reunite in two blocks and leave Lyons southeastward as four-lane Ute Highway. Just outside Lyons, US 36 turns south at a signalized intersection onto two-lane North Foothills Highway, while SH 66 continues east to Longmont. From Lyons to Boulder, US 36 pretty much traces the edge of the foothills. US 36 enters Boulder on four-lane-wide 28th Street, where it serves the city's main shopping area. On the north side of Boulder, it intersects SH 119 at Diagonal Highway, beginning a 1.4 mile overlap that extends until SH 119 turns west onto Canyon Boulevard towards Nederland. One block farther south, SH 7 diverges from its overlap with US 36 by turning east onto Arapahoe Avenue. Leaving the Boulder shopping district, US 36 crosses Boulder Creek and passes through the University of Colorado campus area as an expressway to the interchange with Baseline Road, where it meets Spur US 36, a two-block long connector along 27th Way to SH 93, signed only as \\"To SH 93\\" and \\"To US 36\\". =Boulder to Denver= Just after the Baseline Road interchange, US 36 changes to a southeasterly direction, using the route of the original Denver-Boulder Turnpike, a toll road from its opening in 1952 until 1967. The road intersects SH 157 Foothills Parkway on its way out of Boulder. Northwestbound traffic approaching Boulder on the turnpike can stop at the Davidson Mesa Overlook, providing a panoramic view of the Front Range mountains, the City of Boulder, and its famous Flatirons rock formation; a monument to the Denver-Boulder Turnpike's original builders is also located here. Continuing southeast, the road enters the fast-growing Denver suburbs of Broomfield and Westminster, which have become popular locations for High-Tech businesses, which can be seen lining the turnpike. An interchange at 96th Street provides access to the Northwest Parkway and thereby to the E 470 outer beltway around Denver. At an interchange with SH 121 and SH 128 in Broomfield, it meets (but does not cross) U.S. Highway 287. It then has another interchange with US 287 again at Federal Boulevard near 76th Avenue in Westminster. The interchange at 76th and Federal was the terminus of the original Denver-Boulder Turnpike when it was still a toll road, but in common parlance the Turnpike now extends all the way east to I-25. The US 36 bikeway, part of the multi-modal Fastracks US 36 Express Lanes Project, mostly parallels the road between Table Mesa Drive in Boulder and 80th Avenue in Westminster, the first 11-mile stretch between Westminster and Louisville/Superior opening on Bike-to-Work Day in June 2015, the full route to Table Mesa in Boulder in March 2016. =Denver to Byers (unsigned)= At the very complicated junction of US 36, I-25, I-76, and I-270, US 36 emerges overlapped and unsigned with I-270, and continues overlapped and unsigned with I-70 when I-270 ends near the former Stapleton Airport site. At Colfax Avenue, this I-70/US 36 overlap is also joined by US 287 (the third time the two highways come into proximity) and US 40. From the interchange with Colfax Avenue, the road continues to Watkins and then to Byers, unsigned in its four- way overlap with I-70, US 40, and US 287. =Byers to Kansas state line= At Byers, US 36 heads eastward on its own as a separate rural highway, while the I-70/US 40/US 287 overlap curves to the southeast. US 36 passes through several very small settlements including Last Chance, Lindon, Anton, and Cope in Washington County and Joes and Idalia in Yuma County. Many of the towns on this desolate section of highway are so small they do not provide basic traveler services such as gasoline, and winter drivers are cautioned by signs that there is no snowplowing at night. At Cope, it is joined by SH 59 for about . In Yuma County, near Idalia, it jogs north, becoming concurrent with US 385 for about before turning east again and continuing about to the Kansas border. TollsDenver-Boulder Turnpike= The Denver-Boulder Turnpike was championed by business and university interests in Boulder due to there being no direct route between Denver and Boulder. The toll road stretched from Federal Boulevard (US 287) in Westminster to Baseline Road in Boulder, and opened on January 19, 1952 with a toll of $0.25. The Valley Highway from downtown Denver opened in 1952‚Äì1954, feeding directly into the Turnpike. Most of the new highway carried SH 185 (US 87), but traffic continuing north on that route initially had to exit at 70th Avenue, now SH 224, with the remainder of the route to Federal Boulevard becoming a realignment of SH 382. When the bonds for the Turnpike were paid off ahead of time in 1967, tolls were removed.Superior Historian, March 2006 =Express lanes= Beginning in July 2012, the Colorado Department of Transportation built a high-occupancy toll lane (HOT lane) in each direction between Federal Boulevard and 88th Street in Louisville, Colorado. Phase 1 of the project, costing $497 million, will open in summer 2015. High-occupancy vehicles and buses like RTD's Flatiron Flyer travel free in the HOT lanes, while single-occupancy vehicles must pay between $1.25 to $7.60, depending on time of day, or up to $13.68 without an electronic toll collection pass. To accommodate the lanes, several bridges were replaced and shoulders were widened along the highway. Phase 2 of the project, anticipated to be complete by early 2016, will extend the HOT lanes from 88th Street to Table Mesa Drive in Boulder, Colorado, through a public‚Äìprivate partnership. History The view of Boulder from northbound U.S. Highway 36 as the highway descends into Boulder. The road from Strasburg east to the Kansas state line was added to the state highway system in 1922 as the Colorado part of a proposed \\"Kansas City-Denver Airline Highway\\" that would have cut from the existing highways between Denver and Kansas City. The planned route followed present U.S. Route 36 in Kansas to Mankato, but then turned southeasterly via Concordia and Clay Center to Manhattan, where it met the Victory Highway (now US 24 and US 40).Colorado Highways, April 1922, p. 6 The new state highway was assigned the Primary Road No. 102 designation, and kept its number when many others were changed in 1923.1923 list of state highways, reproduced in Highways to the Sky, Appendix C, p. 39Colorado Department of Transportation, official highway maps: April 1922, July 1924, July 1927, January 1929, 1932, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1939, 1947, 1949, 1951, 1952, 1954, 1955, 1958, 1959, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1968, 1969, 1970 The west end of State Highway 102 was initially at Strasburg,Colorado Highways, July 1923, map of state highways but by 1924 it had been shifted to Byers, using the present County Roads 10 and 197 to return to current US 36. In 1927‚Äì1929 the entire SH 102 became part of US 36, which was realigned to go west rather than southwest from Norton, Kansas. The west end was moved back to Strasburg in 1932‚Äì1934, and a number of right-angle turns were eliminated by constructing diagonal cutoffs west of Cope and at the state line in 1934‚Äì1935. US 36 was extended west in 1936‚Äì1937 as an overlap with US 40 on Colfax Avenue to downtown Denver, where it would end for the next 30 years. Paving began in 1937‚Äì1939 and was completed in 1947‚Äì1949, including a realignment off County Roads DD and 12 north of Idalia. The junction with US 40 near Strasburg-Byers was changed again in 1954‚Äì1955, now following County Road 181 east of Byers.United States Geological Survey, Byers 1:24000, 1956 Finally in 1958‚Äì1959 a realignment west of Idalia eliminated four more 90-degree turns. When the tolls were removed from the Denver-Boulder Turnpike, the road became State Highway 49, which also replaced all of SH 382. US 36 was also extended at this time, following the Valley Highway (by then part of I-25) from Colfax Avenue north to SH 49, and then overlapping SH 49 to the end at Baseline Road, SH 119 on 28th Street, SH 7 to Lyons, and SH 66 to end at US 34 in Estes Park. Late in 1968 these redundant state highway designations were dropped, resulting in the elimination of SH 49 and SH 102, realignment of SH 119 to go more directly in Boulder, and creation of gaps on SH 7 and SH 66. In 2012, the turnpike was also given the honorary name Buffalo Highway in recognition of the University of Colorado's mascot, though this name has not achieved common use. Returning to Colfax Avenue east of Denver, the first part of I-70 in that area opened in 1961‚Äì1962, bypassing Watkins and Bennett and carrying US 36 (and US 40/287). The freeway was extended east past Strasburg and Byers in 1963‚Äì1964, including the final realignment of US 36 northeast of Byers. The old alignment was initially removed from the state highway system, but in 1964‚Äì1965 it returned as part of SH 8. When this route was largely eliminated in late 1968, this bypassed highway instead became State Highway 36 (and SH 40 east of Byers), with US 36 remaining on I-70. US 36 was realigned through Denver in 1970, following I-70 and I-270 north of downtown. (Note that, until 2000, I-270 ended at I-76, and US 36 traffic had to use short pieces of I-76 and I-25.) A final westerly extension came in 1977‚Äì1978, when US 36 replaced the western segment of SH 66 (except for a spur) from Estes Park into Rocky Mountain National Park and another junction with US 34. In early September 2013, a section of US 36 from Estes Park to Boulder was closed due to damage from the 2013 Colorado floods. For a time, the only route available in and out of Estes Park was a long detour through Nederland, Blackhawk, and Golden. The section in North St. Vrain Canyon west of Lyons was especially heavily damaged. Work on U.S. Highway 36 west of Lyons underway as CDOT aims at Dec. 1 opening The road was finally reopened two months later with the help of the National Guard. Flood-damaged US 36 to Estes Park reopening Monday, nearly 1 month ahead of schedule Permanent repairs were started in January, 2014. CDOT to Start Permanent Repairs on U.S. 36 In July 2019, cracks appeared on the eastbound lanes of the highway in Westminster due to shifting soil underneath. The highway has been closed as construction crews try to address the problem. Major junctions The mileposts in Larimer County temporarily reset at the concurrency with US 34. Colorado State Highway 36 SH 36 is the stretch of former US 36 that runs from Aurora to Byers. Its western terminus is at exit 292 of I-70. Form there, it goes east through Watkins, Bennett, and Strasburg, meeting I-70 twice along the way before meeting I-70 for a third time at its eastern terminus (exit 316). This first junction with I-70 east of Aurora is in Bennett, at exit 306. The second such junction is at an underpass near Strasburg, with no access to or from the Interstate. The highway was originally signed as part of SH 8. =Major intersections= Mileposts are based on US 36 mileage.

He was one of the founders of the Progressive Reform Party (VHP), an Indo-Surinamese party founded in 1947 of which he served as President until his death. Biography Lachmon was born in Corantijnpolder in the district of Nickerie. The youngest child of six, his parents were contract laborers from Uttar Pradesh to Suriname. His father was a cook and his mother clipped cane on the plantation Waterloo. His parents had chosen the surname Lachmon when they arrived at the plantation. Later, his parents started a small dairy farm in Nieuw Nickerie. Lachmon left for Paramaribo when he was thirteen, and completed his school qualifications. On the advice of one of his teachers, he decided to practise law. At that time, there were restrictions about legal studies in Suriname. After a long search, he found the creole lawyer Julius Caesar de Miranda who became mentor. Surprised that a Creole was willing to teach an Indian made a great impression on the young Lachmon and laid the basis for his efforts towards reconciliation between the different ethnic groups. In 1940, he started his own law practice, and in 1943, together with other Hindus, he founded the association Djagaran Will. In 1947, Lachmon was one of the founders and forerunner of the United Hindustani Party (VHP), the largest Hindu political party in Suriname (later renamed Progressive Reform Party). Lachmon was chairman, and retained that post until his death. In the general election of 1949, Lachmon won a seat in the States of Suriname, and the National Party of Suriname (NPS) took 13 of the 21 seats, enabling them to form a government. In the 1955 Suriname election, the NPS lost heavily, and Lachmon withdrew one of its candidates to back Johan Adolf Pengel, in order to give him a better chance. From 1964 to 1967 and 1969 to 1973, Lachmon served as the Chairman of the Estates of Suriname.De Nationale Assembl√©e: Lijst van Oud-Voorzitters =Independence= Jagernath Lachmon and Prime Minister Henck Arron with the new flag in November 1975 In February 1974, Henck Arron, the Prime Minister at the time, announced that Suriname would be granted independence from the Netherlands at the end of 1975. Lachmon was in favor of the independence of Suriname, but only in the long term against the will of Hindus. Arron's plans were too hastily for him, because he was afraid of domination of the Indians by the Afro-Creoles. The ethnic tensions in the neighboring country, Guyana (formerly British Guiana) as an example of what could occur to Suriname if the government acted with blind haste. He called for a referendum on independence, if only because that issue had played no role in the elections of 1973. Arron did not want it, and the Dutch government advised against it. In the run-up to independence, this led to severe riots erupted. Lachmon, often mockingly referred to as Lachmon van Oranje (English: Lachmon of the House of Orange), was reconciled to the idea just six days before independence. The commitment of Johan Ferrier to be the first president played an important role. On 25 November 1975, Suriname became independent. In the period after the Sergeants' Coup in February 1980 he took the idea of bending reeds that he admired Mahatma Gandhi had promoted and that his opponents mockingly called bending with all winds. In 1987 elections could be held against partially thanks to Lachmon's reconciliation efforts. His VHP was in the government and Lachmon was chairman of the National Assembly. In total, he was the chairman of the National Assembly five times between 1987 and 2001.De Nationale Assembl√©e: Lijst van Oud-Voorzitters In June 1999 he was in the Guinness Book of Records as the longest-serving parliamentarian in the world. =Death= Lachmon died in a hotel room in The Hague, during an official visit to the Dutch government as chairman of a parliamentary delegation. On 25 October 2001 he was cremated in Paramaribo. In order to emphasize good relationships with the NPS, the body went not only to the VHP-party office, but also to that of the NPS. Lachmon was succeeded as president by Ram Sardjoe. Lachmon was married to Fawziya A.L. Abdul Sovan. A statue of Lachmon is situated on the Onafhankelijkheidsplein (Independence Square). In 2012, a bust of Lachmon was placed in Nieuw-Nickerie. At Kwakoe, the annual Summer Festival in Amsterdam, the \\"Kwakoe Jagernath Lachmon Award\\" is awarded to Surinamese who have been commendable in social or cultural areas.

Shortly after her introduction, Faye was described as being a \\"Glamorous blonde\\" and a \\"brazen hussy\\" by Tony Purnell of the Daily Mirror. Another reporter for the paper called Faye \\"glamorous\\" and said that she was a \\"mini-skirted character\\". They added that Faye had become a favourite with male fans. Describing her first scenes, Purnell said Faye made her entrance in a flash sports car and then \\"showed off her bare midriff and prompted Terry from the Woolpack to describe her as the perfect woman.\\" On 18 August 1996, it was announced that Calvert had chosen to leave Emmerdale. A Yorkshire TV spokesperson said \\"Millions of hearts will be broken, but her leaving won't mean things simmer down.\\" Faye leaves her lover Steve Marchant (Paul Opacic) to go to the city. Granny Hopwood Granny Hopwood, played by Beatrice Kelly, is the mother of Billy Hopwood (David Crellin) and grandmother of Andy Sugden (Kelvin Fletcher) and Daz Eden (Luke Tittensor). She is Andy's legal guardian for much his life prior to 1996, as his father, her son Billy is in and out of jail. They live in a run-down Tower Block of Flats in Leeds. When Jack Sugden (Clive Hornby) brings Andy home, he is taken aback by Granny Hopwood's manner and living conditions. While smoking and drinking heavily, She tells him about Billy's imprisonment and wished that Andy would run away and never come back. Three weeks later, Andy tries to wake his grandmother but cannot. Jack initially believes Mrs Hopwood is drunk but when he arrives at the flat, he finds that she has died. Following her death, The Sugden family subsequently foster and adopt Andy. Lisa DingleJamie Tate James Francis \\"Jamie\\" Tate made his first appearance on 24 September 1996. He was played by various child actors until his departure on 19 January 1999. The character was reintroduced in 2019, with Alexander Lincoln cast in the role. James is the only child of Frank Tate (Norman Bowler) from his marriage to Kim Tate (Claire King). His paternity is initially in doubt as Kim had been having an affair with Dave Glover (Ian Kelsey). Dave dies saving James from a fire before the paternity tests show Frank is the father. Kim expresses doubts about the tests, thinking that Frank's money means he could have paid for the test results to be altered; however, after Frank dies, Dave's father Ned Glover (Johnny Leeze) agrees to a second DNA test, which proves James is Frank's son. The following year, Kim marries Steve Marchant (Paul Opacic). They are involved in a hit and run accident while stealing a horse, and Kim pins the blame on Steve. She escapes with James in a helicopter to avoid being arrested. When Kim returns to the village without James after she spent six years in prison and sent him to boarding school. Kim asks her lover Graham Foster (Andrew Scarborough) to track down James as she needs him back in her life. Graham later gives her James' phone number, but she is forced to leave a voice message as James does not answer the phone. Jamie arrives in Emmerdale in April 2019 to attend an interview for a role at the Emmerdale Veterinary Centre. Jamie stops his Ford Mondeo to let Eric Pollard (Christopher Chittell) cross when Megan Macey (Gaynor Faye) crashes her Volkswagen Golf into the back of him, pushing his Mondeo forward and running over Eric. Megan caused the accident as she was using her phone whilst driving. Eric sustains serious head injuries and is later found to have internal bleeding. Jamie has a major panic attack. Kim later arrives on the scene to find Jamie being treated in the back of an ambulance, telling the paramedics not to let her come. Rhona Goskirk (Zoe Henry) drives Kim to the hospital to see Jamie. Jamie refuses to see Kim and tells Rhona to stay wary of her. Kim steals his car keys so she can see more of him. Jamie later arrives at Home Farm to retrieve his keys from Kim, although she claims she does not have them. They go to The Woolpack to retrieve them from lost property although they are not there. Back at Home Farm, Kim tries to help Jamie piece together what happened. As Jamie confronts his mum about her past, Kim hands back his car keys, just as Graham shows up. He tells her they are finished. Jamie starts a custody battle for his daughter Millie and begins an affair with Belle Dingle (Eden Taylor-Draper). Jamie strikes Moira Dingle (Natalie J. Robb) with his car and leaves the scene. His estranged wife Andrea Tate (Anna Nightingale) learns what happened and blackmails him into breaking up with Belle.

Evans was born and died at West Town in Somerset. Educated at Loretto College, he was a right-handed middle-order batsman and an occasional fast-medium right-arm bowler. His was a curious first-class cricket career: he played 22 matches over 14 years (though he appeared in only six of those seasons) and was used as a specialist batsman. Yet his career average was less than 10. This lack of success is more remarkable as he passed 50 runs in an innings twice in his career, one of them a not-out innings. Gloucestershire player Evans made his first-class debut at Lord's in the Middlesex v Gloucestershire match: he made 1 and 13 and took a single wicket, which would prove to be the only wicket of his first-class career. In his second match, against Sussex, he made an unbeaten 50 in Gloucestershire's follow-on, helping his county to draw the match. In nine other innings for Gloucestershire in the 1889, 1890 and 1891 seasons, however, he reached double figures only once, and then made only 12. Somerset player In July 1894, he played six matches for Somerset, batting mostly in the lower order. He made 37 in a rain-ruined match against Lancashire. And then in the next match he joined his captain Sammy Woods with Somerset's score at 48 for six in the second innings against Surrey and together they put on 127 for the seventh wicket, Evans making 60 and Woods 80. He appeared again in six matches in the 1895 season without similar success and in his final three matches in 1902 he failed in six innings to reach double figures, making only nine runs in all. Family His older brother, Ernest Evans, appeared in one first-class cricket match for Somerset in 1891. External links David Evans at www.cricketarchive.com. References .

The film focuses on the transformation of a working-class man into a rat and how his family copes with the startling change. The film's scenario is partly based on Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis. Plot After his usual night of drinking at the local pub, Hubert Flynn (Pete Postlethwaite) returns home and transforms into a rat. Hubert's family each have different views on him now that he became a rodent. His wife Conchita (Imelda Staunton) thinks that this change is supposed to be a lesson to Hubert and that the reason he transformed is his own fault. Their son Pius (Andrew Lovern), destined for a religious life, feels that because his father is now an animal, his family should kill him. Their daughter Marietta (Kerry Condon) feels that the rat is still her father and that they should treat him with love and respect. After hearing the news of a man changing into a rat on the local radio, ghostwriter Phelim Spratt (David Wilmot) convinces Conchita to write a book of the story. Because Phelim wants to write about Conchita's bravery and the family's loyalty to Hubert in the face of adversity, he suggests that they take Hubert out to the pub and bookie to see his friends and to show the public that they are proud of him. Conchita sends for her brother, Matt (Frank Kelly), whom she describes as \\"a rock of sense\\". After telling the family all of the changes they will have to undergo, including Hubert's poor hygiene, unemployment, and unusual diet, Matt feels that Hubert would be more comfortable in a maggot factory with other rats. This decision is further solidified after Hubert bites Conchita on the finger. After the family leaves him at the maggot factory, Hubert treks forty miles back to the house to be with his family on Christmas. With Hubert nearly dead from exhaustion, Conchita calls the doctor (Geoffrey Palmer) and sends Pius to get Father Geraldo (Niall Toibin) to perform the last rites and an exorcism. After the doctor tells Conchita to cool Hubert down because of his fever, they put him in the refrigerator. Father Geraldo then arrives and performs the exorcism and Hubert emerges from the refrigerator as a man. Because Hubert turned back into a man, Phelim and Conchita are nervous that no one will believe their story. They decide to lock Hubert in his room and use a replacement rat for public appearances. However, Hubert's old flame and neighbour, Daisy (Veronica Duffy) becomes sceptical when she hears him yelling that he needs to use the bathroom and calls for the police to investigate. While Hubert is in the bathroom, he remembers that as a rat, he saw Phelim hide the manuscript of the book in a cupboard. He takes the manuscript and hides it in his shirt. When the family realise that Hubert should be away from prying eyes, Conchita goes to tell him that they are sending him to a mental hospital until the book comes out. When the police arrive, Marietta finds a letter written by her father saying that he feels the same way that he did before he turned into a rat. A rat then runs out the door and the family chases it in the street. When they get the rat back, Phelim tries to put it in the oven and it bites him on the finger. Hubert then appears behind them as a man and explains that the rat Phelim is holding is Conchita. He says that when he bit her earlier, he felt something leave his body and enter hers. He then explains that instead of a book about the family's loyalty, Phelim has been writing about their thoughts of killing Hubert and plans to abandon him at the maggot factory. They throw Phelim out and tell him never to return. Marietta is worried about her mother and Hubert says that she will turn back into a woman when she serves her time. The film ends with the family at the pub with Hubert and Conchita, now a woman again, singing karaoke. It also shows a rat in the pub that has an earring like the one that Phelim wears.

Frank Baum, famous as the creator of the Land of Oz. It is the sixth volume in the ten-book series Aunt Jane's Nieces, Baum's greatest commercial success after the Oz books themselves. Like the other books in the series, this sixth volume was issued under the pen name \\"Edith Van Dyne,\\" one of Baum's multiple pseudonyms.\\"Edith Van Dyne,\\" Aunt Jane's Nieces and Uncle John, Chicago, Reilly & Britton, 1911. Background Unlike the Oz books and Baum's other fantasies, the Aunt Jane's Nieces stories were set in the contemporary world, and so could be enriched with the author's real-life experiences. Baum based much of the material in the sixth book on a trip that he and his wife took through the Southwestern United States in February and March 1904Katharine M. Rogers, L. Frank Baum, Creator of Oz: A Biography, New York, St. Martin's Press, 2002; p. 131.Angelica Shirley Carpenter and Jean Shirley, L. Frank Baum, Royal Historian of Oz, Minneapolis, Lerner Publications, 1992; p. 77. ‚Äî just as he had earlier relied on his 1906 trip to the Mediterranean and Egypt for his books Aunt Jane's Nieces Abroad (1907) and The Last Egyptian (1908).Rogers, pp. 144, 152, 273 n. 54. Aunt Jane's Nieces and Uncle John bears some noteworthy resemblances to Baum's earlier novel Annabel (1906). Both books involve a rich man and a lost child suffering in poverty; both plots depend heavily on coincidence, and both end with a nod to divine providence.Rogers, pp. 138-9, 272 n. 43.Aunt Jane's Nieces and Uncle John, p. 265. Synopsis Aunt Jane's Nieces and Uncle John picks up the continuing story of the three cousins Patsy Doyle, Beth De Graf, and Louise Merrick, and their family; the plot of the book begins three days after the wedding of Louise and her fianc√© Arthur Weldon, the event that concluded the fifth book in the series, Aunt Jane's Nieces in Society. The sixth novel begins, as per pattern, with the cousins' Uncle John getting an inspiration for a new adventure: in this case, the family will escape a cold New York City winter by taking a trip to Southern California, the land of \\"sunshine and roses.\\" Since Louise is away on her honeymoon, she is effectively left out of the story; her place is taken by Major Doyle, Patsy's father ‚Äì the first time that the Major accompanies the young people on their escapades. (The Major is relieved that Uncle John has set his fancy merely on California, and not \\"Timbuktu or Yucatan...Ethiopia or Hindustan....\\") The four travelers (accompanied by Mumbles, Patsy's new puppy) reach Denver by train; along the way, they meet an appealing teenage girl (14 or 15 years old) named Myrtle Dean. Myrtle is a poor orphan; she was injured in an automobile accident, which inhibited her ability to walk. She had been living in Chicago with an aunt, and earned her living by sewing. But now, Myrtle has been sent West by her unsympathetic aunt to find a missing uncle named Anson Jones ‚Äì though neither woman knows if the uncle is still in Leadville, Colorado, his last known address, or if he will be able to care for the girl if she finds him. Patsy and Beth are shocked at her situation; it is clear to them that the aunt has abandoned Myrtle to her own inadequate resources. Uncle John telegraphs ahead, and discovers that the mysterious uncle has left Leadville for parts unknown. Patsy and Beth then adopt Myrtle as their \\"prot√©g√©,\\" and take her with them on their trip. They buy her new clothes, and she shares their hotels, meals, and adventures. (Baum cannot resist the fairy-tale viewpoint, and \\"Edith Van Dyne\\" gives a plug for the Oz books: Myrtle is \\"amazed and awed by the splendor of her new apparel, and could scarcely believe her good fortune. It seemed like a fairy tale to her, and she imagined herself a Cinderella with two fairy godmothers who were young and pretty girls possessing the purse of Fortunatus and the generosity of Glinda the Good.\\")Aunt Jane's Nieces and Uncle John, p. 68. Uncle John buys a large, seven-passenger touring car and outfits it for camping and cross- country travel. He also hires a chauffeur, a half-Indian Qu√©b√©cois named Wampus. The chauffeur provides some of the comic relief in the story, though he is also presented as highly competent, courageous, and principled, a \\"brave and true man.\\" (Baum employs another comic chauffeur in the final book in the series, Aunt Jane's Nieces in the Red Cross.) The party sets off by car from Albuquerque; they visit the Grand Canyon and the Navaho and Hopi reservations. They witness a performance of the Hopi snake dance. In western Arizona they are waylaid by a riotous group of cowboys, who refuse to let them pass until the girls join them in a dance. In what grows into an ugly incident, the travelers are forced to acquiesce ‚Äì at first; but Patsy and Beth, typically clever and resourceful, develop a plan to defeat their opponents and escape. The group reaches California, none the worse for wear; they are delighted with the change of scene. They make the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego their headquarters. (This is another bit of autobiographical writing for Baum; he stayed regularly at the Coronado during trips to California.)Rogers, pp. 131-2, 149.Carpenter and Shirley, pp. 77-8. Myrtle Dean has proved a delightful and rewarding companion; her health has already shown signs of improvement with better diet, less anxiety, and the warmth of new friendships. Myrtle, however, has been the center of a series of curious events. At the Grand Canyon, the travelers saw a morose-looking man standing at the very lip of the canyon; Myrtle, fearing that he intended to jump, cried out to him, and the man turned away from the edge. At San Diego, they once again see the strange man, standing on a cliff over the ocean; Myrtle once again fears his suicide, and cries out to him. The man turns out to be staying at the Coronado; his name in C. B. Jones. Myrtle happens upon him a third time, and takes away the revolver he has been brooding over in his room. After the three incidents, the man becomes emotionally attached to, if not fixated upon, Myrtle. Uncle John's inquiries reveal that the man, Collanson Jones, is the \\"Anson\\" Jones who is Myrtle's missing uncle. The two are happy at this re- unification of their sundered family, and Jones's deep melancholy is relieved (the evil aunt who sent Myrtle away had told him the girl was dead). And since Jones has made his fortune in mining, Myrtle's financial future is secured. Racial Insensitivity As with some of his other books,See: Father Goose: His Book; Father Goose's Year Book; and John Dough and the Cherub. elements in Baum's Aunt Jane's Nieces and Uncle John violate modern standards of racial sensitivity and political correctness. Baum's view of the Indians of the Southwest is not pleasant; the Navaho are criticized for their \\"filth and laziness....\\" The Hopi (Baum calls them the \\"Moki\\") are presented somewhat more positively; their leaders speak \\"excellent English\\" and their snake dance is \\"unique\\" and \\"picturesque,\\" though the girls find it \\"nauseating and offensive....\\"Aunt Jane's Nieces and Uncle John, pp. 106-11. The interlude at the reservations concludes with the chauffeur Wampus catching an Indian thief and sitting on him until his employers return to their car. As Baum puts it, \\"The chauffeur, partly an Indian himself, knew well how to manage his captive and quieted the fellow by squeezing his throat with his broad stubby fingers.\\" Wampus threatens to torture and kill the \\"big Indian,\\" and when Uncle John decides to let the man go Wampus tells him of the \\"mercy of Great White Chief.\\"Aunt Jane's Nieces and Uncle John, pp. 111-13. For more perspective on the issue of bias versus tolerance in Baum's works, see: Daughters of Destiny, Sam Steele's Adventures on Land and Sea, and Sky Island. The villains The main villains in the book are the malicious cowboys who intercept the travelers in western Arizona. Their identity is surprising: they are not Americans but Englishmen, a crew of \\"remittance men.\\" They are offspring of the English gentry and aristocracy, who are paid by their families to live away from home, either for their crimes and sins or simply because they are inconvenient younger sons in the system of primogeniture. Uncle John calls them \\"mollycoddles and social drones....\\" The leader of the group is Algernon Tobey, \\"the fourth son of old Lord Featherbone,\\" who \\"got into a disgraceful mess in London some years ago.\\" The travelers confront the remittance men about their dissolute and disorderly way of life. Patsy argues with one man named Tim, telling him that he should forget about his meagre allowance, leave his barren ranch, and head for the growing cities of the West to build a new life through honest work. Tim, however, rejects this advice; ambition bores him, and he is content with what little pleasure he can squeeze out of his situation. Patsy gives up on Tim; \\"His world was not their world.\\"Aunt Jane's Nieces and Uncle John, pp. 164, 170. (Perhaps coincidentally, Robert W. Service published his poem \\"The Rhyme of the Remittance Man\\" in his 1907 collection The Spell of the Yukon. Mark Twain also wrote about a remittance man in his 1897 book Following the Equator.)

The company is funded by Arts Council England and Bristol City Council but also relies on individual and corporate sponsorship. They have produced over 60 plays and established several new performance venues including the Showboat pub (Horfield), the Hen and Chicken pub (Bedminster), Quakers Friars (Broadmead), the Tobacco Factory (Southville) and Paintworks (Arnos Vale). The company has received many awards for its work, including the London Weekend Television Plays on Stage award and the Guinness/Royal National Theatre Pub Theatre Award. As well as plays Show of Strength have produced numerous play readings and writing workshops. Although based in Bristol the work of the company has received regular attention from the UK national press. History Sheila Hannon and Nick Thomas co-founded the company in Bristol in 1986, and it began as a two-handed company performing in small touring venues. In 1989 the company moved into an upstairs reception room above the Hen and Chicken pub in Bedminster. In the succeeding years they produced five seasons of work building regular and loyal audiences. Their work received growing attention, which was rewarded in 1993 with the LWT Plays on Stage award for the premiere production of A Busy Day, a lost play by the Georgian writer Fanny Burney, which later transferred to the West End. In 1994 they lost the use of that venue, but found a new home in part of the grade I listed building Quakers Friars in Broadmead where in the succeeding three years they produced new and lost work by writers ranging from Peter Nichols (Blue Murder) to Dion Boucicault (How She Loves Him). In 1996 they co-produced The Substance of Fire (Jon Robin Baitz) with the Theatre Royal, Plymouth. In 1997 they lost the use of Quakers Friars and co-produced four plays with Bristol Old Vic, which were also performed at The Talbot Inn, Mells in Somerset. The European premiere of Australian playwright Nick Enright's Good Works won the Guinness/Royal National Theatre Pub Theatre Award. Bristol architect George Ferguson made the first floor of an abandoned tobacco factory in Southville available to Show of Strength in 1998 and the company succeeded in making this into a new theatre venue, the Tobacco Factory Theatre, for South Bristol, which it remains to this day. In three years they produced eleven play including two news works by Peter Nichols and the acclaimed The Wills' Girls by Amanda Whittington which was revived in 2003 and was also staged at the Dublin Fringe Festival. Following a major Arts Council review in 2004, Show of Strength has grown to working with other arts agencies and venues in the South West, including The Everyman Theatre Cheltenham, The Brewhouse Theatre Taunton, The Northcott Theatre Exeter, Bristol Old Vic, Asian Arts Agency and Travelling Light Young Peoples Theatre Company. In 2006 as part of the Brunel 200 celebrations performances of An Audience with Sarah Guppy were produced on Brunel's SS Great Britain and three new plays under the banner title Brunel and Partners were performed at Bristol Temple Meads, Bath Spa, Cheltenham, Gloucester, Plymouth and Newton Abbot railway stations. Trade It? commissioned as part of the 2007 commemoration of the Abolition of the Slave Trade in 1807 was a street performance of ten short plays in June 2008 by writers including Mustapha Matura, Catherine Johnson and Sandi Toksvig. In 2008 Show of Strength suffered a major funding cut from Bristol City Council, but then received a temporary extension until March 2009. In February 2009 Trading Local, a partnership with the Southville Centre, produced short plays in 19 local shops in Southville and Bedminster.

The list was assembled in September 1944 by Joseph Goebbels, the head of the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, and Germany's supreme leader Adolf Hitler. History The list exempted the designated artists from military mobilisation during the final stages of World War II. Each listed artist received a letter from the Nazi Propaganda Ministry which certified his or her status. A total of 1,041 names of artists, architects, music conductors, singers, writers and filmmakers appeared on the list. Of that number, 24 were named as especially indispensable; they thus became the equivalent of National Socialism's \\"national treasures\\". Goebbels included about 640 motion picture actors, writers and directors on an extended version of the list. They were to be protected as part of his propaganda film efforts, which persisted through the end of the war (and culminating in the expensive final UFA production Kolberg, released in January 1945). Many of the cultural figures appearing on the list are no longer widely remembered but there are exceptions, including a number of renowned classical musicians such as the composers Richard Strauss, Hans Pfitzner, Carl Orff and Norbert Schultze, the orchestral conductors Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler and Herbert von Karajan, and the Wagnerian baritone Rudolf Bockelmann.

The 106th District is located in the North East Lower Peninsula and includes all of Alcona, Alpena, Crawford, Montmorency, Oscoda, and Presque Isle counties. He was elected on November 4, 2008 to replace outgoing Rep. Matthew Gillard. Neumann previously represented the 106th District from 1999‚Äì2003 and was an unsuccessful candidate for the Michigan State Senate in 2002. In 2003, he was appointed Fire Marshal for the State of Michigan. Biography Andy Neumann was born in Alpena, Michigan in 1960.

He lives in Alpena and Lansing. He has two daughters Kristin and Sarah. Political career In 1996, Andy Neumann was elected to the Alpena County Commissioner where he served on Budget and Finance, Public Safety and Health, Law Enforcement, and Insurance Committees. In 1998, he announced his candidacy for the 106th State House District, which at that time included the Counties of Alpena, Presque Isle, Cheboygan, and Charlevoix. Neumann won the Democratic Primary and went on to narrowly defeat Republican Phil Ludlow in the General Election. Neumann was easily re-elected in 2000. In 2002, Neumann ran for the open 36th District State Senate Seat, located in the North East Lower Peninsula. Neumann narrowly lost to Republican Tony Stamas, of Midland. He was succeeded in the State House by Democrat Matthew Gillard. In 2003, he was appointed Michigan State Fire Marshal.

RD-0124 engines are used on the Soyuz-2.1b and Soyuz-2-1v. A slight variation of the engine, the RD-0124A, is used on the Angara rocket family URM-2 upper stage. RD-0124 is developed by Chemical Automatics Design Bureau.  Design  RD-0124 engines use a multi- stage turbopump powered by pre-combustion of the engine propellants in the preburner. The kerosene fuel is used for regenerative cooling of the engine. Vehicle attitude control during ascent is provided by gimbaling the engine in two planes. The propellant tanks are helium-pressurized. Four combustion chambers are fed by a single turbopump system. The engine operates at a high chamber pressure and, for the type of propellants used, achieves a very high specific impulse of nearly 360 seconds in vacuum - a specific impulse that can only be exceeded by hydrolox rockets like the RS-25, and by the next- generation methalox rockets like the Raptor engine.  History  The inaugural flight of a launch vehicle using an RD-0124 engine took place on December 27, 2006. Orbital Sciences considered using the RD-0124 in the High Energy Second Stage (HESS) for their Antares rocket. It would have replaced the Castor 30B second stage.  Versions  This upper stage engine has been adapted to two different launch vehicles, the Soyuz-2-1b/v and the Angara family. As such, there are different versions: * RD-0124 (GRAU Index 14D23). It is the version for the Soyuz-2-1b and Soyuz-2-1v Blok-I. It is the first liquid rocket engine designed in Russia after the Soviet period. * RD-0124A. It is the version that powers the Angara URM-2, both the 1.2 and the bigger 5 versions. It differs on the base model in having an extended burn time of 424 seconds and, at , being lighter. * RD-0124DR. Version developed between 2008 and 2013 for the Soyuz-2-3 project.

Texan soldiers under Confederate captains Henry Fossett and S.S. Totten, misunderstanding which tribe occupied a discovered camp, attacked a tribe of peaceful Kickapoo Indians and were badly beaten by an organized defense. Background In mid-December 1864, Captain N.M. Gillentine and two dozen Texas militiamen discovered an abandoned Indian camp of 92 shelter sites along the Clear Fork of the Brazos River, and, suspecting the site to be evidence of hostile Comanche or Kiowa Indians, called for militia to locate and address the threat. On January 1, 1865, Texas Frontier Battalion troops under the command of Captain Henry Fossett arrived at Fort Chadbourne to await the militia concentration. After two days, Fossett led his two companies in search of the trail and located the natives along the Dove Creek, encamped in timberland. Battle Just as Fossett prepared his morning assault, the exhausted militia troops arrived after hard forced march, and the two captains chose to cooperate in a joint attack. Totten agreed that the militia would form a line of battle and approach the camp in a frontal assault astride the creek from the north while better equipped Confederates under Fossett would maneuver around to the southwest, capture the Indians' grazing horse herd, and attack from the flank. Kickapoo Indians inside the camp had been peaceful since the days of the Black Hawk War, but they were not unprepared for violence. The Kickapoo benefited from the well-placed camp, located on a tall bank covered with light timber and protected by natural brier thickets common to the Cross Timbers area. The first militia attacks suffered from brier hazards while under intense Indian rifle fire. According to a witness, three Texan officers (including Gillentine) and sixteen enlisted men were killed in the first few minutes. Fossett's flank attack initially succeeded in capturing the herd, but assault by a Confederate detachment under Lieutenant J.A. Brooks broke down after native gunfire killed a dozen horses. Gradually, the isolated Confederate columns found themselves in crossfire with the Indians closing in. After a brief rout, militia reformed along the Spring Creek to the north, and Kickapoo pursuers inflicted additional casualties on the Confederates escaping to the camp.

The Sheldrick Forest Preserve is a forest located in West Wilton, New Hampshire and owned by The Nature Conservancy. The property is host to a large diversity of old growth trees and a number of plants. The preserve's three miles of trails are available to the public. History The Sheldrick forest was owned by the Sheldrick family since 1897. For more than 150 years, the forest was kept largely undisturbed by logging or agriculture. However, in December 1994, the property was sold to a developer who sought to exploit the land for both timber and gravel deposits. The forester hired to evaluate the land's economic worth, Swift Corwin, recognized the value of the land and contacted The Nature Conservancy in 1995. The original owner agreed to sell the property for several hundred thousand dollars, which was paid in April 1996 through several donations and fundraising events.The Nature Conservancy: Sheldrick Forest Preserve - Trail Map & Guide. The Nature Conservancy, 1995. =Natural history= The Sheldrick Forest Preserve was affected heavily by glacial drift activity approximately 18,000 years ago. Signs of the glacial activity are still visible today. The stone walls and stone bridges in some areas of the forest are indicators of more recent activity, likely being built in the early 19th century.Douglas, Teter: Everything Changes - Discovering the History of Sheldrick Forest, A Self-Guided Interpretive Brochure, page 45.

Take Back the Land was formed in October 2006 to build the Umoja Village Shantytown on a plot of unoccupied land to protest gentrification and a lack of low-income housing in Miami. The group began opening houses in October 2007 and moved six homeless families into vacant homes in 2008. By April 2009, the group had moved 20 families into foreclosed houses. , the group had ten volunteers. Take Back the Land volunteers break into the houses, clean, paint and make repairs, change the locks, and help move the homeless families in. They provide supplies and furniture and help residents turn on electricity and water. Though the occupations are of contested legality, local police officers were not intervening, judging it to be the responsibility of house owners to protect their property or request assistance.  Advocacy  The group advocates for changes in governmental housing policy. Max Rameau, the homeless advocate running the program, called it \\"morally indefensible to have vacant homes sitting there, potentially for years, while you have human beings on the street\\". Rameau says that the group only moves families into government- or bank-owned properties, and argues that it is not fair for the banks to be receiving government bailouts while keeping these assets.  Tactics  Rameau states that having people occupy the buildings helps the owners by preventing looting and property destruction that he says would likely happen to unoccupied buildings. He also says that the group requires that tenants get electricity and provides solar panels if the electricity does not work. Take Back the Land activists help maintain and clean the yards of the squatted houses, and they give the families cleaning supplies and furniture. The group gains access to unoccupied houses, paints and cleans them, changes the locks, and connects electricity and water. Rameau says each occupation costs the group $200. Take Back the Land instructs tenants of the houses to occupy the houses openly; they enter and leave through the front door, pay for utilities in their own names, and are honest with neighbors. The families live in the houses they occupy until they either save up enough money to afford to pay for housing or are forcibly evicted by police. The group maintains a waiting list of families who would like to move into foreclosed homes. Rameau says tenants are carefully chosen in order to avoid creating crack houses; drug addicts are rejected, and participants are assessed for their \\"urgency of need\\". According to Rameau, he had approached banks in 2008 with the idea of buying them for a discount price and renting them to homeless people; they seemed interested at first but he says they stopped calling him back after the 2008 federal bailout was announced. Take Back the Land uses illegal tactics. The group commits trespassing and tenants could be charged with crimes such as vandalism. Rameau says, \\"there's a disconnect between the need and the law. Being arrested is just one of the potential factors in doing this.\\" The tenants are told that they may be arrested if caught. Take Back the Land has a pro-bono lawyer on standby. Kelly Penton, a spokeswoman for the city of Miami, said that the city was not taking action to stop Take Back the Land's activities stating that \\"it is up to the property owner\\". , police had not gotten involved.  Background  Take Back the Land was originally formed in 2006 as an anti-gentrification organization inspired by the Landless Workers' Movement in Brazil and the Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign in South Africa.Take Back the Land in South Africa The group built the Umoja Village in Miami in 2006, a shantytown on an undeveloped lot in support of the \\"black community's right to own land\\". Fifty homeless people lived in the village. After the village burned down in April 2007, the group moved 14 of the ex-residents into a warehouse. Max Rameau released a book detailing the experience entitled Take Back the Land: Land, Gentrification and the Umoja Village Shantytown. Partly due to overbuilding and speculation, Florida, and particularly Miami, have been affected by the housing crisis in the late 2000s recession. In September 2008, Florida had the second highest rate of foreclosures in the country. Take Back the Land moved the first family into an unoccupied house on October 22, 2007. By November 2008, it had opened up six houses, and by April 2009, the group had moved 20 families into foreclosed homes.

The origins of this nickname date back to the mid 20th century, when sailors would recognise they were close to Merseyside when they could see the church. Origins of the church The church was founded by a priest called Father Tom Mullins. Born in Ireland, he studied for Priesthood in Lisbon, Portugal. When Father Tom got back to the Wirral, he was serving at a church (now demolished) in Hope Street. He went on to pursue his dream of constructing the church. When construction was finished New Brighton was becoming a very popular resort. The church opened in 1935.

Father Feeney had a job of looking after three parishes, the others being English Martyrs and Our Lady of Lourdes. Together, all three churches united in becoming the North Wallasey Catholic Community. In 2008, the church was closed by a decision of the local diocese. The parishioners were relocated to another church, about a five-minute walk away, called All Saints, owned by the Church of England In 2011 the church was re-opened for a weekly mass, and there was an expression of interest by a religious order, the Institute of Christ the King, to re-open the church fully. On 15 October 2011 Canon Oliver Meney and another member of the Institute of Christ the King took up residence in the fully renovated presbytery.

The coaster opened in 2009 as part of a new Iceland-themed expansion to Europa-Park. As the first launched coaster built by MACK Rides, Blue Fire was the park's tenth roller coaster and the first to feature inversions. The ride's tagline is \\"Discover Pure Energy\\". Layout Blue Fire is a combination of a dark ride and a launched roller coaster. The ride begins with a dark ride portion lasting roughly 45 seconds. The coaster train is then accelerated to in 2.5 seconds using a linear induction motor launch on an -long launch track. The launch propels the train over a turn that peaks at high. Then, the turn leads into a vertical loop high, which is the tallest loop on any launched roller coaster in Europe. One turn culminates in a mid-course brake run; and, exiting the brake run, the train completes a twisted horseshoe roll that partially passes over a lake. One airtime hill follows, and the ride ends with a heartline roll and final brake run. Blue Fire's twisted horseshoe roll was the first on any roller coaster in Europe and the first on any Mack roller coaster. The element itself had only previously appeared on one other roller coaster, making its debut on Maverick. Construction Blue Fire opened as part of the first phase in a new Iceland-themed area of Europa-Park, which expanded the park's overall area from 70 to 85 hectares. Europa-Park's directors, Roland and J√ºrgen Mack, broke ground on the new Iceland area in June 2008. Europa-Park started posting teasers for Blue Fire on their website in July 2008. The teasers made reference to the coaster's acceleration, inversions, energy, and Iceland theme. In August 2008, the park released an animated teaser, again showing the Iceland theme, along with the train traversing part of the ride's layout. Construction of Blue Fire's track commenced in early September 2008, and the park issued a press release about the new ride on September 18. The press release confirmed that the park was expanding by 15 hectares and gave further details about Blue Fire's launch system and trains. It also mentioned that Blue Fire had the tallest loop of any roller coaster in Europe at 32 metres, which Screamscape blogger Lance Hart pointed out was incorrect because the first loop on Dragon Khan at PortAventura Park reaches a height of 36 metres. The park has since clarified that Blue Fire's loop is the tallest on any launched coaster in Europe. The builders of Blue Fire topped off the ride on October 1, 2008, and completed the track's layout in mid-December 2008. The construction effort required that Europa-Park cut the Fjord-Rafting river rapids ride in half to allow construction workers to access Blue Fire's site. The removed part of Fjord-Rafting was restored as a tunnel section and reopened before the 2009 season. Trains and colour scheme Off-ride video. Blue Fire has five trains with five cars each. These cars accommodate two rows of two riders, for a total of 20 riders per train. However, the ride can only operate 4 trains on the circuit at any given time, with the 5th acting as a spare. With a two-minute, 30-second ride and separate loading and unloading stations, 1,720 riders can ride Blue Fire per hour. The trains use lap bar restraints rather than the over-the-shoulder restraints employed on Maverick and other Intamin Accelerator coasters, and stadium-style seating like that of Millennium Force. As opposed to more conventional lap bars found on most wooden roller coasters, the lap bar on a seat on Blue Fire is above the seat when the train is not occupied. However, the restraint itself rests in the rider's lap instead of across the rider's chest. Carrying on the Iceland theme of its section of the park, Blue Fire has blue track and light gray supports. The attraction's theming was designed by P&P; Projects. Height restriction Europa-Park has set height and age restrictions for Blue Fire. No one under 1.30 metres (51 inches, 4 feet 3 inches) or 7 years of age may ride.

The documents state that a young farmer's leg was restored to him after having been amputated two and a half years earlier. This event is described in detail in the book Il Miracolo by Vittorio Messori. The following article is principally based on the account in Messori's book.  Background  Calanda, Spain At the end of July 1637 Miguel Pellicer (1617‚Äì1647), a 20-year-old man from Calanda in Aragon was working as an agricultural labourer at Castell√≥n, 60 km from Valencia, on his uncle's farm. While steering a cart by riding one of the mules that was pulling it, Miguel fell off, probably because he had fallen asleep. The cartwheel passed over his right leg, breaking the tibia. He received initial treatment at Castell√≥n, then was admitted to the hospital of Valencia, where he stayed for five days. He then decided to leave for Zaragoza in order to receive treatment in the hospital dedicated to Our Lady of the Pillar to whom he had great devotion. The 300 kilometre journey took him some 50 days. On his arrival, the doctors observed that the leg was in an advanced state of gangrene, leaving no other choice but to amputate it. In their testimony, the doctors described the leg as \\"very phlegmonous and gangrenous,\\" to the point of appearing \\"black.\\" In mid-October two master surgeons, Juan de Estanga and Diego Millaruelo, carried out the operation. The leg was cut \\"four fingers below the knee.\\" Although they had made the patient drowsy with alcoholic and drugged drinks, as was the practice at the time, Miguel suffered excruciating pain: \\"In his torment,\\" the witnesses would later say, \\"the young man called upon the Virgin of the Pillar, unceasingly and with great fervor.\\" The leg was then buried, as was customary at the time, in a special part of the hospital's cemetery. The stub was subsequently cauterized with fire. Miguel Juan Pellicer stayed in hospital for a few months, until in the spring of 1638 he was provided with a wooden leg and crutches and released from hospital. For the next two years, he made his living through begging. He was provided with the necessary authorization, at the Sanctuary of the Pillar. During this time he was certainly a familiar sight for a large number of the citizens of Zaragoza. He regularly returned to the hospital for checkups and treatment through Dr. Estanga. Every evening he would ask the servants in the sanctuary for a bit of the oil that burnt in the lamp and use it as ointment to rub in the stub of his leg, with the conviction that he would so be able to draw the aid of the Virgin upon him. In the first months of 1640, now 23 years old, he decided to return to his parents at Calanda. After about one week's travel he arrived during the second week of Lent, i.e. between March 11 and 14. Unable to help in working on the fields, he once again took up begging, going around the neighbouring villages on donkey's back. Many people at the time must have witnessed that his lower leg was missing.  Restoration of Pellicer's legs  According to Messori, at about ten o'clock in the evening of 29 March 1640, Pellicer laid himself to rest. Because his bed was occupied by a soldier of a garrison that stayed at Calanda over night, he went to sleep on a provisional bed in his parents' room. Between half past ten and eleven o'clock, his mother entered the room and saw two feet appearing from below the cloak that covered her son. Thinking that Miguel Juan and the soldier must have changed places, she called her husband to resolve the misunderstanding. But while removing the cloak, husband and wife, were dumbstruck, as they realized that this was indeed their own son. They shook him and shouted at him to wake him up. Some minutes passed until Miguel Juan woke up from a deep sleep. He told them that he had dreamt of being within the Sanctuary of Our Lady of the Pillar and rubbing his leg with the holy oil, as he had done so often. Soon all three agreed that the restoration of the leg was due to the intercession of the Virgin of the Pillar. Templo del Pilar (Calanda) News of the event immediately spread through Calanda. The following morning the local judge, assisted by two surgeons, examined Pellicer and set up a report which he immediately sent to his superiors. On April 1, Palm Sunday, Don Marco Seguer, parish priest of Mazale√≥n, a village fifty kilometres away, went to the place of the event, accompanied by the royal notary Miguel Andr√©u, who set up a certificate to express the testimony, confirmed by oath, of ten persons.  Thanksgiving and inquiry  On April 25 Pellicer and his parents went on a pilgrimage to Zaragoza to give thanks to Our Lady of the Pillar, and here too the young man was seen by a great number of people who had known him before with only one leg. Following a request from the city's authority, a formal inquiry was initiated in order to ascertain the veracity of the event. Legal proceedings, presided by the archbishop of the city began on June 5 and took about a year. All hearings were public and no voice of dissent was recorded. Twenty-four witnesses spoke out, selected as the most trustworthy from among the great number of people that knew Pellicer, both from Calanda and from Zaragoza. On April 27, 1641 the archbishop of Zaragoza pronounced a judgment, thereby officially declaring the authenticity of the miracle. At the end of the year Pellicer was also invited to the royal court at Madrid, where King Philip IV knelt down before him and kissed the leg. Recordings also show that the restored leg was the same one as that which had been amputated two and a half years before, for it could be reidentified through some bruises and scars that were there before the amputation. Also, the hole in the cemetery of the hospital of Zaragoza in which the leg had been buried was excavated and found empty. In the appendix of his book, Vittorio Messori also reports the opinion of Landino Cugola, primary surgeon of the hospital of the University of Verona, a specialist in limb replantation. Cugola has carefully studied the testimonies given in the recordings of the proceedings at Zaragoza, which reveal that the leg, after it had only just been restored, was cold and hard with contracted toes and blue in colour. Hence, Pellicer was not yet able to put his weight on it and still had to move around on crutches. After a few days the leg regained in strength and the toes were stretched out again. Also, the leg was initially a few centimetres shorter due to the loss of bone tissue that was caused by the fracture, but within about three months it regained its original length. According to Cugola, all this is in perfect accordance with the normal development following the replantation of a leg, although the growth of tissue is usually supported by exerting a pull onto the limb. In Pellicer's case this was not necessary.  Documentation  Vittorio Messori also lists and provides details of documents from the time which attest the miracle of Calanda, the most important ones being: * The certificate set up by the notary Andr√©u. The original document, which fortunately escaped destruction in the Spanish civil war, is on display in a glass case in the town hall of Zaragoza. * The minutes of the proceedings at Zaragoza. The original document, having been kept in the archives of Zaragoza chapter house, was handed over to a Benedictine monk, Father Lambert, in about 1930, who then took it to France. Unfortunately Lambert was killed in World War II and it is unknown what has become of the manuscript since. However, before it disappeared four printed editions had been published, the first of which in 1829. Two notaries certified that these corresponded exactly with original text. * Two certified copies of the minutes of the proceedings, set up at the same day as the original. They were signed and sealed by the same notaries. One was kept in the archives of the town of Zaragoza, but burnt in 1808 during the Napoleonic wars. The other is still extant and is kept in the archives of the Cathedral of the Pillar. * The report of Calanda's local judge, set up on the morning immediately after the event. It has not survived to our time, but documentary traces confirm that there was such a report. Casa-Museo Miguel Pellicer (Calanda) Other documents of lesser importance: * The certificate of baptism of Miguel Juan Pellicer. * The registration of his admittance to the hospital of Valencia. * A small booklet written by a Carmelite monk, commissioned by the chapter house of the Pillar, and published in 1641. * Another book, published by a German doctor in 1642. The Jesuit father who gave the imprimatur added a declaration in which he affirmed that he personally knew Pellicer, first with one leg and then with two. * The account of the audience of Miguel Juan Pellicer at the royal court of Madrid. * A number of other documents which confirm the existence of other persons involved in the event. Messori's comment: :‚ÄúBy far the majority of past events (including the more important ones) is attested with less documentary proof and official warrantee. This is an objective statement of fact, not apologetic reassurance.‚Äù  Alternative Explanations  Author Brian Dunning proposes his own version of what might have happened, though he admits \\"We can't say that the Miracle of Calanda is not genuine, and we can't prove that Miguel Juan Pellicer's leg was not miraculously restored.\\" He claims that \\"there is no documentation or witness accounts confirming his leg was ever gone.\\" He presents an alternative explanation in which Pellicer's leg did not develop gangrene during the five days at the hospital at Valencia. Instead, he spent the next 50 days convalescing, during which he was unable to work, and so turned to begging, and discovered that having a broken leg was a boon. After his leg had mended, Dunning proposes Pellicer decided that if a broken leg helped, a missing leg would be better. Traveling to Zaragoza, he bound his right foreleg up behind his thigh and for two years played the part of an amputee beggar. Later, back at his parents home in Calanda, forced to sleep in a different bed, his ruse was discovered, and the story of the miracle was a way to save face. Dunning asserts \\"that no evidence exists that his leg was ever amputated ‚Äî or that he was even treated at all ‚Äî at the hospital in Zaragoza other than his own word. He named three doctors there, but for some reason there is no record of their having been interviewed by either the delegation or the trial.\\" However, according to the transcription of the canonical process, two surgeons involved, Juan de Estanga and Diego Millaruelo, were indeed interviewed, as well as the assistant surgeon Juan Lorenzo Garcia and the hospital's priest overseer Pascual del Cacho. All said, under oath, that the leg of Miguel Pellicer was really amputated. Their testimonies are found on pages 43-45, 51-53, 48-50, and 47-48 respectively.

Life and work  A Fellow of the British Academy,.http://www.britac.ac.uk/fellowship/directory/archive.asp?fellowsID=87 Tom Burns was Professor of Sociology at Edinburgh University from 1965 to 1981, and also taught at Harvard and Columbia. He is best known for his studies of the organization of the BBC, local government, the electronics industry and the National Health Service. He also wrote on his experiences as a non-combatant prisoner of war in Germany during the Second World War. His early interests were in urban sociology, and he worked with the West Midland Group on Post-War Reconstruction and Planning. While he was at Edinburgh his particular concern was with studies of different types of organization and their effects on communication patterns and on the activities of managers. He has also explored the relevance of different forms of organization to changing conditions - especially to the impact of technical innovation. In collaboration with psychologist George Macpherson Stalker, Burns has studied the attempt to introduce electronics development work into traditional Scottish firms, with a view to their entering this modern and rapidly expanding industry as the markets for their own well-established products diminished. He created a term mechanistic organization- and organismic (also called organic organization) organization. He expressed his approach to research and expressed in the preface to the second edition of The Management of Innovation: \\"by perceiving behaviour as a medium of constant interplay and mutual redefinition of individual identities and social institutions...it is possible to begin to grasp the nature of changes, developments and historical processes through which we move and which we help to create.\\" The book \\"The Development of the Modern State: A Sociological Introduction\\" by Gianfranco Poggi is dedicated to Tom Burns.  Writings  First published in 1961, Burns' The Management of Innovation remains one of the most influential books of organization theory and industrial sociology. The central theme of the book is the relationship between an organization and its environment - particularly technological and market innovations. The book presents the authors' classifications of \\"mechanistic\\" and \\"organic\\" systems. For this it became famous, but the book is also a penetrating study of social systems within organizations and organizational dynamics. In 1977 he published The BBC: Public Institution and Private World. His last work published during his lifetime was an intellectual biography of Erving Goffman. Following his retirement from academic life in 1981 he worked until his death in 2001, on a comparative history of organization entitled Organisation and Social Order. The work was never fully completed.

Political career Before the rise of the extreme right, Max Th√©ret often engaged with street battles against French Stalinists during the years following the death of Vladimir Lenin and the intense power struggle between Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky. Between 1936 and 1939, Max Th√©ret joined the loyalists in the Spanish Civil War. After which he returned to France, where he met with Trotsky who was in exile, and became his informal bodyguard. During the Second World War he fought for the French army, and joined the resistance during the Occupation, helping to distribute leftist newspapers. Forming of Fnac Th√©ret had a passion for photography which originally began in 1932. When hunted by the Gestapo, Th√©ret left the Occupied Zone in 1942, moving to Grenoble, where he took up photography as a career. After the war, he trained as a photo laboratory technician, founded his own laboratory, and later constructed the first colour-processing machine in France. In 1951, while working for the PTT telephone company, he founded Economie Nouvelle, a buying group that arranged discounts for members on products sold through participating merchants. In 1953, he met Andr√© Essel, the other co-founder of Fnac, and the two conceived the idea of forming a new buyers club through a magazine called Contact. Founded a year later in 1954, Fnac was exclusive to its members only, offering sharp discounts on its products, based on the founders' socialist principles. Their aim was to improve the lives of the workers, not through higher salaries but through lower prices. In 1974, Fnac began selling books at 80% off the Recommended Retail Price, sparking protests and a law in 1982 that limited the level of discounts that could be offered on books. He left the company in 1981.

It was there, in their living room at home, that Eduardo's father and mother, Mercedes Junco Calder√≥n (1920‚Äì2019), came up with the idea of a magazine showing life at its most beautiful, through reporting that would be both respectful and truthful. And so, on September 8, 1944, ¬°Hola! was born. Since then, it has become a publishing empire in a class of its own. Eduardo, just a year old when the magazine was launched, grew up surrounded by the tools of the trade, but his own interests focussed at first not on publishing, but on nature. He studied agricultural engineering. But while he always maintained a strong interest in this subject, he also felt drawn to his parents‚Äô profession, and joined his father at work on ¬°Hola!, by then already a household name. Following his father's death in 1984, Eduardo took over the helm of the business. He chose to do so in the most hands-on way, as a journalist. While bringing up their three children ‚Äì daughters Mamen and Cheleles, and son Eduardo ‚Äì he and his wife, Mamen P√©rez Villota, together studied for degrees in journalism. Eduardo, a media visionary, then embarked on a new stage of his company's expansion, propelling it onto the international stage. He launched Hello! magazine, which, like ¬°HOLA!, marked a true departure, being the first magazine of its kind in Britain. By the end of his career Eduardo had become a publishing legend. Thanks to him, ¬°HOLA! exists in no less than 14 different national editions across the world. As well as Spain and Britain, 12 more countries belong to the ¬°HOLA! family: Russia, Turkey, Thailand, Dubai, Greece, Morocco, Canada, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Serbia and Brazil. Published in ten different languages, the magazine is exported to a total of 70 countries, where it is read by 12 million people each week, making it one of the most-read publications in the world. Then there are the online editions, hola.com ‚Äì the leading women's-interest internet portal, with 60 million page hits per month ‚Äì and its English- language version, hellomagazine.com. Eduardo was recognised with numerous prizes (see below). Among them are the European Forum's Gold Medal, the Gold Medal from the Queen Sofia Spanish Institute in New York and the Luca de Tena prize, presented to him by the King of Spain, as well as the International Press Directory's International Publishing Award. To understand Eduardo the media magnate one had to understand Eduardo the man. He thought of his company as an extension of his family, and in fact all three of his children, as well as his mother and his wife, play key editorial roles. This guarantees the continued success of a title which has already made history. Along with his charismatic personality, Eduardo's publishing philosophy was responsible for his extraordinary achievements. He knew to perfection what to offer his readers. He defined it as \\"the froth of life, nothing dense, nothing heavy. Not claiming to be anything more than entertainment, but always tasteful and discreet, never harmful nor judgmental, and never descending to gossip. A kind magazine, full of human interest.\\" Notes Spanish language prizes English language prizes References Category:1943 births Category:2010 deaths Category:Spanish magazine publishers (people) ","title":"Eduardo S√°nchez Junco"},{"id":"20953786","title":"Mary O'Connor (runner)"},{"id":"20953801","text":"Leo Portnoff Leo Portnoff (1875 in Kiev - 1940 in Miami, Florida) was a musician, teacher, and composer.

Although the exact reason is unclear, the new Reverend was said to have been spotted being cruel to a slave.Rev. Jonathan Leavitt's father Lieut. Joshua Leavitt of Suffield, Connecticut, had also been an early slaveholder, whose slave 'Princess' died at Suffield on November 5, 1732.Documentary History of Suffield in the Colony and Province of the Massachusetts Bay in New England, 1660-1749, Hezekiah Spencer Sheldon, Clark W. Bryan Company, Springfield, Mass., 1879 \\"It is handed down that, having dragged home a negro slave, a woman, who had run away, by a rope attached to his saddle\\", according to a history of Walpole, \\"[prominent local citizen] Colonel Bellows declared that such cruelty should not be submitted to; that he had settled Parson Leavitt, and now he would unsettle him. Ministers, however, were not got rid of so easily in those days. Being settled for life, they had rights which they well understood; and it is plain that some considerable diplomacy was required to shake Mr. Leavitt off.\\"  Departure from Walpole and arrival in Massachusetts  On May 17, 1764, on the eve of a town meeting called to discuss Leavitt's tenure - and his act of cruelty towards his slave Historic Towns of the Connecticut River Valley, George S. Roberts, Robson & Adee, Publishers, Schenectady, N. Y., 1906 - the minister suddenly accepted a payment from the townsmen for services rendered and agreed to depart. Two years later, in 1767, Rev. Leavitt secured an appointment as the minister of Charlemont, Massachusetts, in the mountainous northwestern corner of the state. The congregation in the Berkshires was looking for a minister to pastor the town's first church, and Leavitt was selected. But the imperious Leavitt once again got into trouble with his congregation. After arriving with his family to an auspicious beginning, Leavitt's Loyalist sentiments began to rub his congregants the wrong way. The matter of wardrobe might have complicated things. \\"Mr. Leavitt dressed in the costume of his day\\", noted a fellow minister. \\"He wore a great white wig and a cocked up hat, and made a dignified appearance. He would do more execution with one nod of his wig, than you or I could in talking half an hour.\\" Another ministerial colleague noted that Rev. Leavitt's sermons \\"are not fresh and beautiful by the imagination, not ardent and overflowing with love, but didactic, dry, and clean, and very long. His services were delivered in a dull monotony, and his prayers were incredibly long, in public and in family devotions.\\"A History of the Churches and Ministers, and of Franklin Association in Franklin County, Massachusetts, Theophilus Packard Jr., S. K. Whipple and Company, Boston, 1854 Aside from matters of dress, comportment and diction, Leavitt possessed another trait which apparently sealed his fate: he was enamored with English colonial rule - a delicate subject anywhere in the American colonies, but especially among the hardscrabble rural settlers attempting to scratch a living from the Berkshire hill country.Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, Massachusetts Historical Society, Vol. III, E.W. Metcalf & Co., Cambridge, 1833 Whether because his congregants were hard-pressed, or because they objected to Leavitt's sympathies with mother England,Massachusetts Loyalists in the Revolutionary War, Lorenzo Sabine, Little, Brown and Company, Boston, 1864, usgwarchives.net they held back his pay. One rumor, never proved, was that the Reverend personally confiscated the only cows belonging to two of his poorer parishioners to pay his back salary.  Departure from another church, later life and legacy  By 1777 matters came to a head.Divisions Throughout the Whole: Politics and Society in Hampshire County, Massachusetts, 1740-1775, Gregory H. Nobles, Cambridge University Press, 1983 Leavitt refused to accept his salary in rapidly depreciating colonial currency. So the town voted to simply shut the church. A constable was dispatched to bar the offending reverend. But Leavitt would not be deterred. He moved his services to the town schoolhouse, where he continued to preach his long sermons for almost another decade. On April 15, 1785,The New England Gazetteer, John Hayward, Published by Otis Clapp, Boston, Mass., 1857 he was finally turned out by the town,Despite his banishment by the town of Charlemont, Rev.

Jonathan Leavitt's son Jonathan. and his schoolhouse sermons came to an end. He then sued his parishioners for his back wages, as well as his loss on the depreciated colonial currency. Ultimately the litigious reverend was awarded some ¬£700, and retired to his home in nearby Heath, Massachusetts.Biographical Sketches of Loyalists of the American Revolution, Lorenzo Sabine, Vol. II, Little, Brown & Co., Boston, 1864 Rev. Jonathan Leavitt spent the rest of his life at his home in Heath,In 1790 a new church was built at Heath, and the pews were sold to the highest bidders. Rev. Jonathan Leavitt bought rights to the most prominent pew for ¬£8 6s. and retired from the ministry.When the town of Heath later incorporated itself in 1794, it made a point of protecting itself in its incorporation papers from any liabilities it might incur as a result of the residency of the controversial Rev. Leavitt might bring upon the town. His wife, the former Sarah Hooker, died at Heath on October 11, 1791, when a daughter gave her the wrong medicine. Her husband Rev. Leavitt died on September 9, 1802, aged 71. In the year before his death, in 1801, Rev.

The film is based upon the life of the French composer Hector Berlioz. The title is taken from the five-movement programmatic Symphonie fantastique of 1830. The film lasts around 90 minutes and was first shown at the 'Normandie' cinema in Paris on 1 April 1942. The posters at the premiere contained the sub-title 'La Vie passionn√©e et glorieuse d'un g√©nie' (which links with the quote from Hugo at the very end of the film). The French Biblioth√®que du film (BiFi) contains an earlier draft plan for the film which envisaged a less realistic, more fantastic treatment of the story, entitled La Symphonie du r√™ve, with Pierre Fresnay in the central role.Tourre, Franck. L'image de Berlioz au regard du film La Symphonie fantastique. Association Nationale Hector Berlioz - Bulletin de liaison No 43 janvier 2009 ISSN 0243-3559, p28-40. The cast included several members of the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise (Barrault, Saint-Cyr, Seigner, Berthau, Delamare, Fonteney). Barrault took part in a BBC2 programme in 1969 on the centenary of the composer's death, as Berlioz again, and in the autobiographical L√©lio, sequel to the symphony.The Hector Berlioz Website - Centenary of Berlioz‚Äôs death on 8 March 1969- Commemorative programmes on the BBC accessed 21 June 2015. Shortly after the film was released, Goebbels, having learnt of it, was displeased, considering it too patriotic and determined to summon the German producer Alfred Greven to Berlin to remind him that the French should only have light and superficial new films ‚Äì and not cultivate French nationalism.  Synopsis  The film is biographical, telling the story of the life and artistic struggles of the French composer Hector Berlioz. Berlioz is shown as a recalcitrant medical student in an anatomy class dreaming of becoming a composer; at a demonstration during a performance at the Paris Op√©ra conducted by Habeneck; at supper with other young artists (Hugo, Janin, Dumas, M√©rim√©e, Delacroix); and chasing after his future wife Harriet Smithson, after a performance of Hamlet. Also depicted are his life in a garret, while suffering from an illness due to an abscess in the throat; a visit from his mother who curses him; and the composition of the Symphonie fantastique. The film then shows his marital breakdown, the premiere of his opera Benvenuto Cellini, his travels throughout Europe, his second marriage to Marie Recio (called \\"Marie Martin\\" in the film), public acceptance in old age and reconciliation with his son. The film makes a vivid recreation of important public sites: a lecture theatre at the Faculty of Medicine, backstage at the Th√©√¢tre de l'Od√©on, the Paris Opera, Montmartre lanes as well as salons and caf√©s.

This is due to the Declaration of Boulogne in 1905, which made the early works of Zamenhof binding; most attempts to change the language have been therefore seen as distinct language projects (so-called Esperantidos), and for the most part the Esperanto community has ignored them. The main change in the language has been a great expansion of the vocabulary, largely driven by translations of technical jargon, which is explicitly allowed for by Boulogne. However, there have been more subtle changes to syntax and semantics as the majority of Esperanto authors shifted from native speakers of Slavic and German to other languages, such as French and English. (See: evolution of Esperanto.) This article considers some of the purposeful changes to the language since Boulogne. Lexicon There has been considerable debate over whether technical terminology should be taken from international usage by adopting new roots into Esperanto, or whether, in cases where the need can be met through traditional Esperanto word formation, that is the better way to go. To a large extent this is a cultural debate: Europeans who are already familiar with such \\"international\\" vocabulary often favor adopting such terms, whereas Asians who may not be familiar with them often favor replacing them. One example is the word for \\"computer\\". Early proposals for the word \\"computer\\" included komputero and komputoro, but they were eventually replaced by the internal creation komputilo, from the verb komputi \\"to compute\\" plus the suffix -ilo \\"instrument\\". There has been some criticism of using the prefix mal- to create the antonyms of common adjectives, such as mallonga \\"short\\" from longa \\"long\\", or malmultekosta \\"inexpensive\\" from multekosta \\"expensive\\". Several dozen neologisms have been coined for these antonyms (in these cases kurta \\"short\\" and ƒâipa \\"cheap\\"), often for purposes of poetry, but few have met with much acceptance. One of the few that have been is dura \\"hard\\", as the original word malmola, from mola \\"soft\\", is argued to sound too soft to mean \\"hard\\". In one case an antonymic suffix has been proposed, a laudatory -el-, which would contrast with pejorative -aƒâ-: skribo \\"writing\\", skribaƒâo \\"scrawl, scribbling\\", skribelo \\"calligraphy\\". Unlike aƒâa, it is problematic to use the suffix -el- as a word in its own right, due to an existing preposition and prefix el. Phonology The most visible change in Esperanto phonology has been the near-loss of the sound ƒ•. For example, the German-derived word ƒ•ino \\"Chinese\\" has been replaced by an Italian/English ƒâino. In most other cases, ƒ• has been replaced with k, as in kemio for ƒ•emio \\"chemistry\\"; the only words which commonly retain it are ƒâeƒ•o \\"Czech\\", eƒ•o \\"echo\\", and ƒ•oro (or koruso) \\"chorus\\", though it continues to be used in the transcription of foreign names. (See: loss of phonemic ƒ• and the section preceding that for examples of assimilation which do not affect the written language.) Changes in phonotactics, which was never laid out explicitly by Zamenhof, have been introduced along with new vocabulary and especially foreign names. One of these is the extension of ≈≠, which originally was only found as a vowel in the diphthongs a≈≠ and e≈≠, to a consonantal use analogous to English w, which Zamenhof had universally replaced with v. However, Slavs and Germans, among others, have difficulty distinguishing v and consonantal ≈≠, and in most neologisms, consonantal ≈≠ has been replaced with v, as it has in ≈≠ato ‚Üí vato \\"Watt\\". In proper names, such as ≈¨akajama ~ Vakajama \\"Wakayama\\", there is more variation. Similarly, new ≈≠ diphthongs such as o≈≠ have not gotten far; the English word bowl was adopted as bovlo, not *bo≈≠lo.However, there has been no conflict over introducing changes which conform to both Esperanto and Western European languages. For example, even though the European currency is required by law to be spelled euro in official documents in all European Union languages which use a Latin script, in Esperanto the spelling e≈≠ro is used to conform to the pronunciation of the word in those languages. Another debated change has been the introduction of geminate consonants. In traditional Esperanto, double consonants may occur across morpheme boundaries, as in mallonga (mal-longa) \\"short\\", but are not found within roots. Most words introduced with double letters (including tƒâ and dƒù) have since been modified, for example Buddo ‚Üí Budao \\"Buddha\\". Perhaps the most common root to retain a double consonant is finno \\"Finn\\", which is a near homonym with fino \\"end\\". Although suomo has been introduced as a replacement, this has not been used for compounds such as finno-ugra \\"Finno- Ugric\\". There is considerable debate whether departing from the international forms of such words is desirable. Morphology Esperanto morphology has been extended by new suffixes, but outside of international technical terminology few of these are in wide use. Two have been accepted as official: The suffix -io used to derive the names of countries and states, such as Meksikio \\"Mexico\\" vs. Meksiko \\"Mexico City\\" and Va≈ùintonio \\"Washington state\\" vs. Va≈ùintono \\"Washington DC\\". Many Esperantists also use -io in place of -ujo, the original suffix for countries named after their inhabitants, so that Anglio \\"England\\" is found alongside the more traditional Anglujo. The other official addition is a suffix -enda indicating that something must be done (pagenda \\"payable (by)\\"); this was originally introduced as part of the Ido reform. A few other Ido suffixes have entered the language, especially in poetry, and are widely recognized, such as -oza \\"full of\\", as in poroza \\"porous\\". The perceived clash between several national Romance languages, such as Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian, which use the final vowels -o and -a to mark gender, and Esperanto, which uses them to mark parts of speech, has led to a change in some women's names which end in -a in those languages. This has had less effect on names which parallel Esperanto usage, such as Jozefa ~ Jozefino \\"Josephine\\" (from Jozefo \\"Joseph\\"), but is now predominant in names such as Johana ~ Johanino \\"Joanna\\" and especially Maria ~ Mariino \\"Maria\\". Another gender-related change has been a gradual reduction of the number of inherently masculine words. Originally all members of a profession, such as dentisto \\"a dentist\\", all people defined by a characteristic, such as junulo \\"a youth\\" and Kristano \\"a Christian\\", all ethnicities, such as anglo \\"an Englishman\\", and all verbal participles used for humans, such as kuranto \\"a runner\\", were masculine unless specifically made feminine with the suffix -ino; currently only some twenty words, mostly kinship terms, remain masculine. A more radical change has been to purposefully eliminate gender from the remaining masculine roots such as patro \\"father\\" which are not essentially masculineEssentially masculine words include e≈≠nuko \\"eunuch\\", which cannot be meaningfully made feminine. There are also a few analogous essentially feminine words which are not addressed by these proposals. by the introduction of a masculine suffix to parallel feminine -ino. The most common proposal is -iƒâo, which is widely recognized. A parallel change is the introduction of a gender-neutral third-person singular pronoun to cover \\"s/he\\", but there was little agreement as to what this should be until finally most people settled on ri. Both changes are strongly resisted by a majority of Esperantists, who hold to the Declaration of Boulogne. (See: gender in Esperanto.) Syntax An early debate in Esperanto syntax was whether phrases such as \\"he was born\\" should use the present participle -at- (naskata for \\"born\\"), preferred by native speakers of Germanic and Slavic languages, or the past participle -it- (naskita), preferred by native speakers of Romance languages. The debate partially centered on whether the essential difference between the suffixes was one of tense or aspect, but primarily followed the conventions of speakers' native languages. Eventually a work-around using the inchoative suffix -iƒù- as a mediopassive became common as a way to avoid the debate entirely. More recently, stative verbs have been increasingly used instead of copula-plus-adjective phrasing, following some poetic usage, so that one now frequently hears li sanas for li estas sana \\"he is well\\". This may have been inspired by Asian languages such as Chinese and Japanese which treat adjectival concepts as essentially verbal. There was resistance especially in the case of participles (li falantas \\"he is falling\\", li falantis \\"he was falling\\", li falintas \\"he has fallen\\", li falintis \\"he had fallen\\", etc.), which many Europeans found overly complex. Although still minority usage, the debate over such forms has largely subsided. A few new prepositions have been introduced by removing the part-of-speech ending from existing roots. The most common of these is far \\"by\\", an abbreviation of fare de \\"done by\\". The phrase fare de helps avoid sometimes ambiguous readings of the preposition de \\"of, from, by\\". Another neologism is cit from the verb citi \\"to quote\\", and used to introduce quotations. (Sometimes je or na (below) is seen instead.) An occasional difficulty in Esperanto is using the accusative with noun phrases which do not readily accept the accusative suffix -n, such as correlatives like ties \\"that one's\\", quotations (see: cit above), or phrases which already include an accusative suffix, such as provoj savontaj ƒùin \\"attempts to save it\\", forpelado hundon \\"driving away the dog\\". Traditionally, the preposition de has been used in the latter situation, but this is highly ambiguous: forpeladon de hundo could mean the dog was driven away (accusative case), something was driven away by the dog, or something was driven away from the dog. An accusative preposition na has been proposed and is widely recognized. However, the existing indefinite preposition je might be used just as well: forpeladon na hundo, je hundo. Conditional participles -unt-, -ut- have been created by analogy with the past, present, and future participles -int-, -it-; -ant-, -at-; -ont-, -ot-, by extending vowel equivalences of the verb tenses -is, -as, -os to the conditional mood -us. For example, la reƒùunto is \\"the man who would be king\\"; a hakuta arbo is \\"a tree that would be chopped down\\" (if it weren't spiked, etc.). However, while these forms are readily recognized, they are uncommon. Similarly, a nonce active participle with gnomic tense has been created by analogy with existing pairs of noun and verb such as prezidento \\"president\\" and prezidi \\"to preside\\", and the resulting participles prezidanto \\"one who is (currently) presiding\\", etc. There is no passive equivalent apart from the inchoative suffix -iƒùi mentioned above.

Closed from 1931 to 1939, the prison was used by the military from 1939 to 1948. That year, the prison was converted back to civilian use. It was re-roled as a Category B prison for local adult males in 1990. In October 1999, an inspection report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons stated that progress at the prison was being impeded by \\"obstructive and uncooperative staff\\" who \\"used a heavy-handed approach with inmates and relied on strength of numbers rather than personal relationships to keep order.\\" In July 2001, it was revealed that Preston was the most overcrowded prison in England and Wales. Statistics showed that Preston had a 78% rate of overcrowding. Three years later, a report from the Prison Reform Trust again highlighted Preston as being the most overcrowded prison, with 90% of inmates sharing single cells. The prison today Preston is a Category B prison holding local adult males, remanded or sentenced from Crown Courts and Magistrates Courts serving Lancashire and Cumbria.

It was released on March 10, 2009. The album received both critical and public acclaim. It received favourable reviews and the lyrics were praised. Commercially, it reached number 1 on the Jazz charts and entered on the Billboard 200 at number 71. The album debuted and peaked at number 12 on the Official UK Albums Chart. All the songs were written or co-written by Peyroux. According to her, the album is an attempt to resume her philosophy of life and she started working on it after the release of Half the Perfect World.  Song information  * The album opens with \\"Instead\\", a retro-tune with a positive message (\\"Instead of feeling bad/be glad/You're not on your own\\"), which resembled old Depression-Era songs. * The second track, the title song, supposedly inspired by a passage from a book by Buddhist nun Pema Ch√∂dr√∂n, \\"When Things Fall Apart: Heartfelt Advice for Difficult Times\\",contains Shakespearian references: \\"Old Hamlet's done now, dead and gone, and there's no ghost walks/Poor Yorick tells ya everything he knows with no tongue to talk\\". * \\"Damn the Circumstances\\" is a slow-tempo song, which critics considered to be one of the \\"most memorable and enchanting songs of the album\\". * \\"River of Tears\\", written by Peyroux in collaboration with her producer Larry Klein, sings about her father who \\"drinked the way a monk could pray\\", while she also seems to invite listeners to listen to some smooth jazz. On this track, Peyroux resembles Joni Mitchell. * \\"You Can't Do Me\\" was the first single of the album, released in February 2009. Although, as of March 25, 2009, it hasn't been released in any EP or video clip. It is an up-tempo, jazz-rock song, with the recognisable help of Walter Becker. The song makes reference to T.S. Eliot's The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock. * The sixth track, \\"Love and Treachery\\", was considered by a critic as the \\"song Leonard Cohen never wrote\\". * \\"Our Lady of Pigalle\\", a classic song, is the scenario of a woman being propositioned walking around the streets of Paris late at night, referencing her to being a symbol of salvation. A version in French, \\"Notre Dame de Pigalle\\", was released as a bonus track in the Japanese Edition. * In \\"Homeless Happiness\\", fans are introduced to the singer's past experiences while she went busking through Europe. It talks about the advantages of living a simple life with \\"No worries, no hurries\\". * \\"To Love You All Over Again\\" is just in the right place on the track listing, balancing the sad songs with a more cheery rhythm. * \\"I Must Be Saved\\" is written solely by Peyroux. It is a love song that talks about how someone can lose everything, even the things they never thought they would lose, but they will always be saved. Peyroux dedicated this song to folk singer Odetta, her \\"spiritual grandmother\\", who died on December 2, 2008. * The album closes with \\"Somethin' Grand\\", which was written in \\"support of the new era with Barack Obama\\".

He was a close associate of photographer Alfred Stieglitz and was one of the founding members of the Photo-Secession. Over the course of his life Keiley's photographs were exhibited in more than two dozen international exhibitions, and he achieved international acclaim for both his artistic style and his writing. Life Keiley was born in Maryland, the eldest of seven children born to John D. and Ellen Keiley. The family moved soon after his birth to Brooklyn, New York, where he grew up. Little is known about his childhood. \\"Lenore\\" by Joseph Keiley He went to school in New York and became an attorney, founding the Manhattan law firm of Keiley & Haviland. He began photographing in the mid-1890s and met fellow New York photographer Gertrude K√§sebier, who at that time was engaged in photographing American Indians who were performing in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. Keiley also photographed some of the same subjects, and in 1898 nine of his prints were exhibited in the Philadelphia Photographic Salon. One of the judges for the Salon was Stieglitz, who also wrote a glowing review of Keiley's work. Due to his success in Philadelphia the next year Keiley became the fourth American elected to the Linked Ring, which at that time was the most prominent photographic society in the world promoting pictorialism. In 1900 he joined the Camera Club of New York and had a one-person exhibition in the Club's gallery. At that time Stieglitz was serving as the Vice President of the Club and editor of the Club's journal Camera Notes, and Keiley soon became his closest ally. Stieglitz asked him to become Associate Editor of the journal, and over the next few years Keiley was one of its most prolific writers, contributing articles on aesthetics, exhibition reviews and technical articles. He also had several of his photographs published in the journal. While working with Stieglitz the two began experimenting with a new printing technique for glycerine-developed platinum prints, and they co-authored an article on the subject that was later published in Camera Notes. In 1902 Stieglitz included Keiley as one of the founding members of the Photo-Secession, and he had fifteen of his prints (one more than Edward Steichen) included in the inaugural exhibition of the Photo- Secession at the National Arts Club. When Stieglitz started Camera Work in 1903 he asked Keiley to become Associate Editor, and for the next eleven years he was second only to Stieglitz in the details of publishing the journal. He contributed dozens of essays, reviews and technical articles, and he advised Stieglitz about promising new photographers from Europe. Keiley had seven gravures published in Camera Work, one in 1903 and six in 1907. Later in his life he traveled to Europe and Mexico, and he spent several years trying to seat a radical friend, in a peaceful coup, as President of Mexico. In 1914 Keiley died of Bright's Disease. Stieglitz wrote a long eulogy for his friend in Camera Work, and he kept Keiley's name on the masthead of the journal until it ceased publication in 1917.

With the aim of political independence, these began shortly after the French invasion of Spain in 1807 during Europe's Napoleonic Wars. Although there has been research on the idea of a separate Spanish American (\\"creole\\") identity separate from that of Iberia,D.A. Brading, The First America: The Spanish Monarchy, Creole Patriots, and Liberalism, 1492-1866. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1993 political independence was not initially the aim of most Spanish Americans, nor was it necessarily inevitable.Brian Hamnett, The End of Iberian Rule on the American Continent, 1770-1830. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2017. With the restoration of Ferdinand VII in 1814, the King rejected any type of popular sovereignty, as seen in the Spanish Constitution of 1812 passed by the Cortes of C√°dizthe parliamentary Regency in place while Ferdinand VII was deposed. The Liberal Triennium of 1820 also did not change the position of the C√°diz constitution against separatism, while Latin Americans were increasingly radicalized seeking political independence.Timothy Anna,\\"Review\\", American Historical Review vol. 123 (3) 2018, pp. 985-86. The violent conflicts started in 1809 with short-lived governing juntas established in Chuquisaca and Quito in opposing the government of the Supreme Central Junta of Seville. In 1810, numerous new juntas appeared across the Spanish domains in the Americas when the Central Junta fell to the French invasion. Although various regions of Spanish America objected to many crown policies, \\"there was little interest in outright independence; indeed there was widespread support for the Spanish Central Junta formed to lead the resistance against the French.\\"David Bushnell, \\" Wars of Independence: South America\\" in The Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 5, p. 446. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. While some Spanish Americans believed that independence was necessary, most who initially supported the creation of the new governments saw them as a means to preserve the region's autonomy from the French. Over the course of the next decade, the political instability in Spain and the absolutist restoration under Ferdinand VII convinced many Spanish Americans of the need to formally establish independence from the mother country. These conflicts were fought both as irregular warfare and conventional warfare. These wars began as localized civil wars, that later spread and expanded to promote general independence from Spanish rule. This independence led to the development of new national boundaries based on the colonial provinces, which would form the future independent countries that constitute contemporary Latin America during the early 19th century. Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule until the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898. The new republics from the beginning abolished the formal system of racial classification and hierarchy, casta system, the Inquisition, and noble titles. Slavery was not abolished immediately but ended in all of the new nations within a quarter century. Criollos (those of Spanish descent born in the New World) and mestizos (those of mixed American Indigenous and Spanish blood or culture) replaced Spanish-born appointees in most political governments. Criollos remained at the top of a social structure that retained some of its traditional features culturally, if not legally. For almost a century thereafter, conservatives and liberals fought to reverse or to deepen the social and political changes unleashed by those rebellions. The events in Spanish America were related to the wars of independence in the former French colony of St-Domingue, Haiti, and the transition to independence in Brazil. Brazil's independence, in particular, shared a common starting point with that of Spanish America, since both conflicts were triggered by Napoleon's invasion of the Iberian Peninsula, which forced the Portuguese royal family to flee to Brazil in 1807. The process of Latin American independence took place in the general political and intellectual climate that emerged from the Age of Enlightenment and that influenced all of the Atlantic Revolutions, including the earlier revolutions in the United States and France. A more direct cause of the Spanish American wars of independence were the unique developments occurring within the Kingdom of Spain and its monarchy during this era. Concluding, finally, with the emergence of the new Spanish American republics in the post-Napoleonic world. Historical context Development of Spanish American Independence 250px Political independence was not necessarily the foreordained outcome of the political turmoil in Spanish America. \\"There was little interest in outright independence.\\"David Bushnell, \\"Wars of Independence: South America\\" in The Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 5, p. 446. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. As historians R.A. Humphreys and John Lynch note, \\"it is all too easy to equate the forces of discontent or even the forces of change with the forces of revolution.\\"R.A. Humphreys and John Lynch, \\"Introduction\\", The Origins of the Latin American Revolutions, 1808-1826. New York: Alfred A. Knopf 1965, p. 7. Since \\"by definition, there was no history of independence until it happened,\\"Jeremy Adelman, \\"Independence in Latin America\\" in The Oxford Handbook of Latin American History, Jos√© C. Moya, ed. New York: Oxford University Press 2011, p. 154. when Spanish American independence did occur, explanations for why it came about have been sought. The Latin American Wars of Independence were essentially led by European diaspora against European empires. =Administrative and economic reforms= There are a number of factors that have been identified. First, increasing control by the Crown of its overseas empire via the Bourbon Reforms of the mid-eighteenth century introduced changes to the relationship of Spanish Americans to the Crown. The language used to describe the overseas empire shifted from \\"kingdoms\\" with independent standing with the crown to \\"colonies\\" subordinate to Spain. In an effort to better control the administration and economy of the overseas possessions the Crown reintroduced the practice of appointing outsiders, almost all peninsulars, to the royal offices throughout the empire. This meant that Spanish American elites were thwarted in their expectations and ambitions by the crown's upending of long-standing practices of creole access to office holding.Mark A. Burkholder and D.S. Chandler, From Impotence to Authority: The Spanish Crown and the American Audiencias, 1687-1808. Columbia: University of Missouri Press 1977. The regalist and secularizing policies of the Bourbon monarchy were aimed at decreasing the power of the Roman Catholic Church. The crown had already expelled the Jesuits in 1767, which saw many creole members of the Society of Jesus go into permanent exile. By limiting the power of the Church, the crown attempted to centralize itself within the institutions of colonial Latin America. Because of the physical and ideological proximity that the clergy had,Mills, Kenneth; Taylor, William B.; Lauderdale Graham, Sandra (2002). Colonial Latin America: A Documentary History. Maryland: SP Books. p. 144. they could directly influence and dictate the interactions between populations of colonial Latin America, either as legal counsel or an advisor;Mills, Kenneth; Taylor, William B. Taylor; Lauderdale Graham, Sandra (2002). Colonial Latin America: A Documentary History. Maryland: SR Books. p. 107. a directness which the crown would need to attempt to create the centralized, colonial state which it wanted to implement. Later in the eighteenth century the crown sought to decrease the privileges (fueros) of the clergy, restricting clerical authority to spiritual matters and undermining the power of parish priests, who often acted as agents of the crown in rural parishes.Nancy Farriss, Crown and Clergy in Colonial Mexico, 1759-1821. London: Athlone Press 1968. By desacralizing power and frontal attacks on the clergy, the crown, according to William B. Taylor, undermined its own legitimacy, since parish priests had been traditionally the \\"natural local representatives of their Catholic king.\\"William B. Taylor, \\"Early Latin American Social History\\" in Reliving the Past: The Worlds of Social History. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press 1985, p. 149. In the economic sphere, the crown sought to gain control over church revenues. The Church functioned as one of the largest economic institutions within colonial Latin America. It owned and retained jurisdiction over large amounts of land, which the crown wanted for itself because of the economic value which could be derived from the land.Mills, Kenneth; Taylor, William B.; Lauderdale Graham, Sandra (2002). Colonial Latin America: A Documentary History. Maryland: SP Books. p. 309-313. Moreover, by taking that land for itself, the Crown had the opportunity to cut down the physical presence of the Church to further weaken its ideological and social role within local colonial communities. In a financial crisis of 1804, the crown attempted to call in debts owed the church, mainly in the form of mortgages for haciendas owned by the elites. The Act of Consolidation simultaneously threatened the wealth of the church, whose capital was mainly lent for mortgages, as well as threatening the financial well-being of elites, who depended on mortgages for acquiring and keeping their estates. Shortening the repayment period meant many elites were faced with bankruptcy.Margaret Chowning, \\"The Consolidaci√≥n de Vales Reales in the Bishopric of Michoac√°n.\\" Hispanic American Historical Review 69:3 (1989) 451-78. The crown also sought to gain access to benefices elite families set aside to support a priest, often their own family members, by eliminating these endowed funds (capellan√≠as) that the lower clergy depended on disproportionately.Michael P. Costeloe, Church Wealth in Mexico: A Study of the \\"Juzgado de Capellan√≠as\\" in the Archbishopric of Mexico, 1800‚Äì1856. Cambridge University Press 1967. Prominently in Mexico, lower clergy participated in the insurgency for independence with priests Miguel Hidalgo and Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos. The reforms had mixed results. In some areas‚Äîsuch as Cuba, R√≠o de la Plata and New Spain‚Äîthe reforms had positive effects, improving the local economy and the efficiency of the government.Lynch, The Spanish American Revolutions, 17‚Äì19, 334‚Äì335. Rodr√≠guez, The Independence of Spanish America, 19‚Äì27. Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 7‚Äì12. In other areas, the changes in the crown's economic and administrative policies led to tensions with locals, which at times erupted into open revolts, such as the Revolt of the Comuneros in New Granada and the Rebellion of T√∫pac Amaru II in Peru. The loss of high offices to Peninsulars and the eighteenth-century revolts in Spanish South America were the some of the direct causes of the wars of independence, which took place decades later, but they have been considered important elements of the political background in which the wars took place.Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 5‚Äì17. Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 24‚Äì25. Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 12‚Äì14, 17‚Äì32. Many Creoles, particularly the wealthy creoles, were negatively impacted by the Bourbon Reforms. This resulted in their taking action by using their wealth and positions within society, often as leaders within their communities, to spur resistance to convey their displeasure with Spanish reforms because of the negative economic impact which they had.Lynch, John (2001), \\"Spanish America's Poor Whites: Canarian Immigrants in Venezuela, 1700‚Äì1830\\", Latin America between Colony and Nation, Palgrave Macmillan UK, pp. 58‚Äì73, , retrieved 2020-01-13 However, because of how quickly their revolts would further radicalize the lower classes, the Creoles quickly stopped supporting general violent insurrection because they benefitted from social change that occurred through the systems of the Spanish crown. Institutional change ensured stability by supporting the political institutions that allowed for the creation of a wealthy Creole class and further adapting those institutions to meet demands, rather than propose a radical shift in the complete make-up of socioeconomic life and traditions. However, institutional change did not come as anticipated and further spurred on the radicalization of Spanish-American social classes towards independence. =Military restructuring= Spain's international wars in the second half of the 18th century evidenced the empire's difficulties in reinforcing its colonial possessions and provide them with economic aid. This led to an increased local participation in the financing of the defense and an increased participation in the militias by the Chilean-born. Such development was at odds with the ideals of the centralized absolute monarchy. The Spanish did also formal concessions to strengthen the defense: In Chilo√© Archipelago Spanish authorities promised freedom from the encomienda those indigenous locals who settled near the new stronghold of Ancud (founded in 1768) and contributed to its defense. The increased local organization of the defenses would ultimately undermine metropolitan authority and bolster the independence movement. =Spread of Enlightment ideals= Other factors may include Enlightenment thinking and the examples of the Atlantic Revolutions. The Enlightenment spurred the desire for social and economic reform to spread throughout Spanish America and the Iberian Peninsula. Ideas about free trade and physiocratic economics were raised by the Enlightenment in Spain and spread to the overseas empire and a homegrown Spanish American Enlightenment. The political reforms implemented and the many constitutions written both in Spain and throughout the Spanish world during the wars of independence were influenced by these factors.Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 27‚Äì34. Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 14‚Äì18. Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 14‚Äì17, 23.  Creation of new ruling institutions in Spain and Americas, 1808‚Äì1810 Collapse of the Bourbon dynasty= Somosierra Pass against a French invading army The Peninsular War was the trigger for conflicts in Spanish America in the absence of a legitimate monarch. The Peninsular War began an extended period of instability in the worldwide Spanish monarchy that lasted until 1823. Napoleon's capture of the Bourbon monarchs precipitated a political crisis in Spain and Spanish America. Although the Spanish world almost uniformly rejected Napoleon's plan to place his brother, Joseph, on the throne, there was no clear solution to the lack of a king. Following traditional Spanish political theories on the contractual nature of the monarchy (see Philosophy of Law of Francisco Su√°rez), the peninsular provinces responded to the crisis by establishing juntas. The move, however, led to more confusion, since there was no central authority and most juntas did not recognize the claim of some juntas to represent the monarchy as a whole. The Junta of Seville, in particular, claimed authority over the overseas empire, because of the province's historic role as the exclusive entrep√¥t of the empire.Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 36‚Äì37. Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 51‚Äì56, 58‚Äì59. Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 12, 35‚Äì37. This impasse was resolved through negotiations between the several juntas in Spain counted with the participation of the Council of Castile, which led to the creation of a main government: the \\"Supreme Central and Governmental Junta of Spain and the Indies\\" on September 25, 1808. It was agreed that the kingdoms of the peninsula would send two representatives to this Supreme Central Junta, and that the overseas kingdoms would send one representative each. These kingdoms were defined as \\"the viceroyalties of New Spain (Mexico), Peru, New Granada, and Buenos Aires, and the independent captaincies general of the island of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Chile, Province of Venezuela, and the Philippines.\\"Royal Order of the Central Junta of January 22, 1809, cited in Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 60. This plan was criticized for providing unequal representation to Spanish America; nevertheless, throughout the end of 1808 and early 1809, the regional capitals elected candidates, whose names were forwarded to the capitals of the viceroyalties or captaincies general. Several important and large cities were left without direct representation in the Supreme Junta. In particular Quito and Chuquisaca, which saw themselves as the capitals of kingdoms, resented being subsumed in the larger Viceroyalty of Peru and Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata respectively. This unrest led to the establishment of juntas in these cities in 1809, which were eventually quashed by the authorities within the year. An unsuccessful attempt at establishing a junta in New Spain was also stopped. =Spanish institutional revolution= Deputies of Cortes of C√°diz by territories The escape to C√°diz and the dissolution of the Supreme Central Junta on January 29, 1810, because of the reverses suffered after the Battle of Oca√±a by the Spanish forces paid with Spanish American money, set off another wave of juntas being established in the Americas. French forces had taken over southern Spain and forced the Supreme Junta to seek refuge in the island-city of C√°diz. The Supreme Junta replaced itself with a smaller, five- man council, called the Regency, or the Council of Regency of Spain and the Indies. Next, in order to establish a more legitimate government system, the Regency called for the convening of an \\"extraordinary and general Cortes of the Spanish Nation\\": which was convened as the Cortes of C√°diz. The plan for the election of the Cortes, based on provinces, and not kingdoms, was more equitable and provided more time to determine what would be considered an overseas province.Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 50‚Äì52, 236‚Äì239. Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 53‚Äì55, 61‚Äì70, 80‚Äì81. Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 43‚Äì45. The Cortes of C√°diz was the first national assembly to claim sovereignty in Spain. It represented the abolition of the old kingdoms.El \\"Manifiesto de los persas\\"una alternativa ante el liberalismo espa√±ol.Alexandra Wilhelmsen.1979 The opening session was held on 24 September 1810, in the building now known as the Real Teatro de las Cortes under the siege of French army. It met as one body and its members represented the entire Spanish empire. citation: \\"It met as one body, and its members represented the entire Spanish world\\" =Response in Spanish America= Most Spanish Americans saw no reason to recognize a rump government that was under the threat of being captured by the French at any moment, and began to work for the creation of local juntas to preserve the region's independence from the French. Junta movements were successful in New Granada (Colombia), Venezuela, Chile and R√≠o de la Plata (Argentina). Less successful, though serious movements, also occurred in Central America. Ultimately, Central America, along with most of New Spain, Quito (Ecuador), Peru, Upper Peru (Bolivia), the Caribbean and the Philippine Islands remained under control of royalists for the next decade and participated in the Cortes of C√°diz efforts to establish a liberal government for the Spanish Monarchy.Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 43‚Äì45, 52‚Äì56, 132‚Äì133, 195‚Äì196, 239‚Äì240. Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 75‚Äì82, 110‚Äì112, 123‚Äì125, 136‚Äì139, 150‚Äì153. Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 36‚Äì37, 46, 52‚Äì53, 58‚Äì59, 61‚Äì62.  Military campaigns  250px Extension of the Spanish empire =Civil wars for disputed sovereignty, 1810‚Äì14= The creation of juntas in Spanish America, such as the Junta Suprema de Caracas on April 19, 1810, set the stage for the fighting that would afflict the region for the next decade and a half. Political fault lines appeared, and were often the causes of military conflict. On the one hand the juntas challenged the authority of all royal officials, whether they recognized the Regency or not. On the other hand, royal officials and Spanish Americans who desired to keep the empire together were split between liberals, who supported the efforts of the Cortes, and conservatives (often called \\"absolutists\\" in the historiography), who did not want to see any innovations in government. Finally, although the juntas claimed to carry out their actions in the name of the deposed king, Ferdinand VII, their creation provided an opportunity for people who favored outright independence to promote their agenda publicly and safely. The proponents of independence called themselves patriots, a term which eventually was generally applied to them.Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 36‚Äì37, 134‚Äì135. Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 52‚Äì53. Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 45‚Äì46, 53. The idea that independence was not the initial concern is evidenced by the fact that few areas declared independence in the years after 1810. The congresses of Venezuela and New Granada did so in 1811 and also Paraguay in same year (14 and 15 of May 1811). Some historians explain the reluctance to declare independence as a \\"mask of Ferdinand VII\\": that is, that patriot leaders felt that they needed to claim loyalty to the deposed monarch in order to prepare the masses for the radical change that full independence eventually would entail.The phrase is used by Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 56‚Äì58, 133. For a similar analysis without the phrase, see Nevertheless, even areas such as R√≠o de la Plata and Chile, which more or less maintained de facto independence from the peninsular authorities, did not declare independence until quite a few years later, in 1816 and 1818, respectively. Overall, despite achieving formal or de facto independence, many regions of Spanish America were marked by nearly continuous civil wars, which lasted well into the 1820s. In Mexico, where the junta movement had been stopped in its early stages by a coalition of Peninsular merchants and government officials, efforts to establish a government independent of the Regency or the French took the form of rebellion, under the leadership of Miguel Hidalgo. Hidalgo was captured and executed in 1811, but a resistance movement continued, which declared independence from Spain in 1813. The Guti√©rrez‚ÄìMagee Expedition was a joint Tejanos-US volunteers expedition formed in Louisiana for Texas independence but was defeated in the Battle of Medina. In Central America, attempts at establishing juntas were also put down, but resulted in significantly less violence. The Caribbean islands, like the Philippines on the other side of the world, were relatively peaceful. Any plots to set up juntas were denounced to the authorities early enough to stop them before they gained widespread support.Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 107‚Äì111, 134‚Äì137, 162‚Äì172, 195‚Äì200, 238‚Äì240, 313‚Äì319, 335. Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 93‚Äì111, 115, 123‚Äì126, 136‚Äì144, 147‚Äì156, 164‚Äì165, 168, 176‚Äì177. Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 46, 50, 52‚Äì53, 66‚Äì67, 100‚Äì101. Major cities and regional rivalries The Battle of San Lorenzo in 1813 Major cities and regional rivalry played an important role in the wars. The disappearance of a central, imperial authority‚Äîand in some cases of even a local, viceregal authority (as in the cases of New Granada and R√≠o de la Plata)‚Äîinitiated a prolonged period of balkanization in many regions of Spanish America. It was not clear which political units should replace the empire, and there were no new national identities to replace the traditional sense of being Spaniards. The original juntas of 1810 appealed first to a sense of being Spanish, which was counterposed to the French threat; second, to a general American identity, which was counterposed to the Peninsula lost to the French; and third, to a sense of belonging to the major cities or local province, the patria in Spanish.Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 121, 131‚Äì132. Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 13‚Äì19, 22, More often than not, juntas sought to maintain a province's independence from the capital of the former viceroyalty or captaincy general as much as from the Peninsula itself. Armed conflicts broke out between the provinces over the question of whether some cities or provinces were to be subordinate to others as they had been under the crown. This phenomenon was particularly evident in South America. This rivalry also led some regions to adopt the opposite political cause to that chosen by their rivals. Peru seems to have remained strongly royalist in large part because of its rivalry with R√≠o de la Plata, to which it had lost control of Upper Peru when the latter was elevated to a viceroyalty in 1776. The creation of juntas in R√≠o de la Plata allowed Peru to regain formal control of Upper Peru for the duration of the wars.Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 57‚Äì71, 162‚Äì163, 240‚Äì242. Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 111‚Äì113, 126‚Äì136, 153‚Äì159, 176‚Äì179. Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 53, 59. Social and racial tensions Exodus from the town of Caracas 1814 Underlying social and racial tensions also had a great impact on the nature of the fighting. Rural areas were pitted against urban centers, as grievances against the authorities found an outlet in the political conflict. This was the case with Hidalgo's peasant revolt, which was fueled as much by discontent over several years of bad harvests as with events in the Peninsular War. Hidalgo was originally part of a circle of liberal urbanites in Quer√©taro, who sought to establish a junta. After this conspiracy was discovered, Hidalgo turned to the rural people of the Mexican Baj√≠o to build his army, and their interests soon overshadowed those of the urban intellectuals. A similar tension existed in Venezuela, where the Spanish immigrant Jos√© Tom√°s Boves formed a powerful, though irregular, royalist army out of the Llaneros, mixed- race slave and plains people, by attacking the white landowning class. Boves and his followers often disregarded the command of Spanish officials and were not concerned with actually re-establishing the toppled royal government, choosing instead to keep real power among themselves. Finally, in the back country of Upper Peru, the republiquetas kept the idea of independence alive by allying with disenfranchised members of rural society and native groups, but were never able to take the major population centers. Increasingly violent confrontations developed between Spaniards and Spanish Americans, but this tension was often related to class issues or fomented by patriot leaders to create a new sense of nationalism. After being incited to rid the country of the gachupines (a disparaging term for Peninsulares), Hidalgo's forces indiscriminately massacred hundreds of Criollos and Peninsulares who had taken refuge at the Alh√≥ndiga de Granaditas in Guanajuato. In Venezuela during his Admirable Campaign, Sim√≥n Bol√≠var instituted a policy of a war to the death, in which royalist Spanish Americans would be purposely spared but even neutral Peninsulares would be killed, in order to drive a wedge between the two groups. This policy laid the ground for the violent royalist reaction under Boves. Often though, royalism or patriotism simply provided a banner to organize the aggrieved, and the political causes could be discarded just as quickly as they were picked up. The Venezuelan Llaneros switched to the patriot banner once the elites and the urban centers became securely royalist after 1815, and it was the royal army in Mexico that ultimately brought about that nation's independence.Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 118‚Äì121, 197‚Äì198, 200, 204‚Äì207, 306‚Äì313. Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 113‚Äì122, 132, 159‚Äì167. Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 54, 66‚Äì70. =King's war against independence, 1814‚Äì20= By 1815 the general outlines of which areas were controlled by royalists and pro-independence forces were established and a general stalemate set in the war. In areas where royalists controlled the main population centers, most of the fighting by those seeking independence was done by isolated guerrilla bands. In New Spain, the two main guerrilla groups were led by Guadalupe Victoria in Puebla and Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca. In northern South America, New Granadan and Venezuelan patriots, under leaders such as Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, Francisco de Paula Santander, Santiago Mari√±o, Manuel Piar and Jos√© Antonio P√°ez, carried out campaigns in the vast Orinoco River basin and along the Caribbean coast, often with material aid coming from Cura√ßao and Haiti. Also, as mentioned above, in Upper Peru, guerrilla bands controlled the isolated, rural parts of the country.Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 168, 184, Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 70, 97. Restoration of Ferdinand VII In March 1814, following with the collapse of the First French Empire, Ferdinand VII was restored to the Spanish throne. This signified an important change, since most of the political and legal changes made on both sides of the Atlantic‚Äîthe myriad of juntas, the Cortes in Spain and several of the congresses in the Americas, and many of the constitutions and new legal codes‚Äîhad been made in his name. Before entering Spanish territory, Ferdinand made loose promises to the Cortes that he would uphold the Spanish Constitution. But once in Spain he realized that he had significant support from conservatives in the general population and the hierarchy of the Spanish Catholic Church; so, on May 4, he repudiated the Constitution and ordered the arrest of liberal leaders on May 10. Ferdinand justified his actions by stating that the Constitution and other changes had been made by a Cortes assembled in his absence and without his consent. He restored the former legal codes and political institutions and promised to convene a new Cortes under its traditional form (with separate chambers for the clergy and the nobility), a promise never fulfilled. News of the events arrived through Spanish America during the next three weeks to nine months, depending on time it took goods and people to travel from Spain.Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 169‚Äì172. Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 56‚Äì57. Ferdinand's actions constituted a definitive de facto break both with the autonomous governments, which had not yet declared formal independence, and with the effort of Spanish liberals to create a representative government that would fully include the overseas possessions. Such a government was seen as an alternative to independence by many in New Spain, Central America, the Caribbean, Quito, Peru, Upper Peru and Chile. Yet the news of the restoration of the \\"ancien r√©gime\\" did not initiate a new wave of juntas, as had happened in 1809 and 1810, with the notable exception of the establishment of a junta in Cuzco demanding the implementation of the Spanish Constitution. Instead most Spanish Americans were moderates who decided to wait and see what would come out of the restoration of normalcy. In fact, in areas of New Spain, Central America and Quito, governors found it expedient to leave the elected constitutional ayuntamientos in place for several years in order to prevent conflict with the local society.Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 336. Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 106. Liberals on both sides of the Atlantic, nevertheless, continued to conspire to bring back a constitutional monarchy, ultimately succeeding in 1820. The most dramatic example of transatlantic collaboration is perhaps Francisco Javier Mina's expedition to Texas and northern Mexico in 1816 and 1817.Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 162. 171‚Äì172, 207. Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 173‚Äì175, 192‚Äì194 Spanish Americans in royalist areas who were committed to independence had already joined the guerrilla movements. However, Ferdinand's actions did set areas outside of the control of the crown on the path to full independence. The governments of these regions, which had their origins in the juntas of 1810, and even moderates there, who had entertained a reconciliation with the crown, now saw the need to separate from Spain if they were to protect the reforms they had enacted. Royalist military The Battle of Rancagua in 1814 During this period, royalist forces made advances into New Granada, which they controlled from 1815 to 1819, and into Chile, which they controlled from 1814 to 1817. Except for royalist areas in the northeast and south, the provinces of New Granada had maintained independence from Spain since 1810, unlike neighboring Venezuela, where royalists and pro-independence forces had exchanged control of the region several times. To pacify Venezuela and to retake New Granada, Spain organized in 1815 the largest armed force it ever sent to the New World, consisting of 10,500 troops and nearly sixty ships.Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 209. Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 122. Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 57.Small contingents from Spain had been arriving in the Americas since 1810. On August 25, 1810, a group of Spanish Marines arrived in Veracruz from C√°diz on the frigate, Nuestra se√±ora de Atocha under the command of Rosendo Porlier and accompanying Viceroy Francisco Javier Venegas. These were the first Spaniards to have come from Europe in support of royalists. Frieyro de Lara. Guerra ej√©rcito y sociedad en el nacimiento de la Espa√±a contempor√°nea. (2009, Universidad de Granada) p. 660. (See, Spanish reconquest of New Granada.) Although this force was crucial in retaking a solidly pro-independence region like New Granada, its soldiers were eventually spread out throughout Venezuela, New Granada, Quito, and Peru and were lost to tropical diseases, diluting their impact on the war.Rebecca Earle, \\"'A Grave for Europeans'? Disease, Death, and the Spanish-American Revolutions\\" in Christon I. Archer, ed. The Wars of Independence in Spanish America, 283‚Äì297. More importantly, the majority of the royalist forces were composed, not of soldiers sent from the peninsula, but of Spanish Americans. Overall, Europeans formed only about a tenth of the royalist armies in Spanish America, and only about half of the expeditionary units, once they were deployed in the Americas. Since each European soldier casualty was replaced by a Spanish American soldier, over time, there were more and more Spanish American soldiers in the expeditionary units. For example, Pablo Morillo, commander in chief of the expeditionary force sent to South America, reported that he had only 2,000 European soldiers under his command in 1820; in other words, only half the soldiers of his expeditionary force were European. It is estimated that in the Battle of Maip√∫ only a quarter of the royalist forces were European soldiers, in the Battle of Carabobo about a fifth, and in the Battle of Ayacucho less than 1% was European. The American militias reflected the racial make-up of the local population. For example, in 1820 the royalist army in Venezuela had 843 white (espa√±ol), 5,378 Casta and 980 Indigenous soldiers. Royalist army Pro- independence advances Towards the end of this period the pro-independence forces made two important advances. In the Southern Cone, a veteran of the Spanish army with experience in the Peninsular War, Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, became the governor of the Province of Cuyo. He used this position to begin organizing an army as early as 1814 in preparation for an invasion of Chile. This was an important change in strategy after three United Provinces campaigns had been defeated in Upper Peru. San Mart√≠n's army became the nucleus of the Army of the Andes, which received crucial political and material support in 1816 when Juan Mart√≠n de Pueyrred√≥n became Supreme Director of the United Provinces. In January 1817, San Mart√≠n was finally ready to advance against the royalists in Chile. Ignoring an injunction from the congress of the R√≠o de la Plata not to move against Chile, San Mart√≠n together with General Bernardo O'Higgins Riquelme, later Supreme Director of Chile, led the Army over the Andes in a move that turned the tables on the royalists. By February 10, San Mart√≠n had control of northern and central Chile, and a year later, after a war with no quarter, the south. With the aid of a fleet under the command of former British naval officer Thomas Cochrane, Chile was secured from royalist control and independence was declared that year. San Mart√≠n and his allies spent the next two years planning an invasion of Peru, which began in 1820.Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 138‚Äì141. Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 179‚Äì182. Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 72‚Äì75. In northern South America, after several failed campaigns to take Caracas and other urban centers of Venezuela, Sim√≥n Bol√≠var devised a similar plan in 1819 to cross the Andes and liberate New Granada from the royalists. Like San Mart√≠n, Bol√≠var personally undertook the efforts to create an army to invade a neighboring country, collaborated with pro- independence exiles from that region, and lacked the approval of the Venezuelan congress. Unlike San Mart√≠n, however, Bol√≠var did not have a professionally trained army, but rather a quickly assembled mix of Llanero guerrillas, New Granadan exiles led by Santander and British recruits. From June to July 1819, using the rainy season as cover, Bol√≠var led his army across the flooded plains and over the cold, forbidding passes of the Andes, with heavy losses‚Äîa quarter of the British Legion perished, as well as many of his Llanero soldiers, who were not prepared for the nearly 4,000-meter altitudes‚Äîbut the gamble paid off. By August Bol√≠var was in control of Bogot√° and its treasury, and gained the support of many in New Granada, which still resented the harsh reconquest carried out under Morillo. Nevertheless, Santander found it necessary to continue the policy of the \\"war to the death\\" and carried out the execution of thirty-eight royalist officers who had surrendered. With the resources of New Granada, Bol√≠var became the undisputed leader of the patriots in Venezuela and orchestrated the union of the two regions in a new state called Colombia (Gran Colombia).Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 209‚Äì218. Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 184‚Äì192. Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 78‚Äì87. =Independence consolidated, 1820‚Äì33= January 1, 1820, Rafael Riego headed a rebellion of Spanish expeditionary force to be sent to the Americas To counter the advances the pro-independence forces had made in South America, Spain prepared a second, large, expeditionary force in 1819. This force, however, never left Spain. Instead, it became the means by which liberals were finally able to reinstate a constitutional regime. On January 1, 1820, Rafael Riego, commander of the Asturias Battalion, headed a rebellion among the troops, demanding the return of the 1812 Constitution. His troops marched through the cities of Andalusia with the hope of extending the uprising to the civilian population, but locals were mostly indifferent. An uprising, however, did occur in Galicia in northern Spain, and from there it quickly spread throughout the country. On March 7, the royal palace in Madrid was surrounded by soldiers under the command of General Francisco Ballesteros, and three days later, on March 10, the besieged Ferdinand VII, now a virtual prisoner, agreed to restore the Constitution.Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 194. Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 88, 114, 120‚Äì121, 127‚Äì128. Riego's Revolt had two significant effects on the war in the Americas. Militarily, the large numbers of reinforcements, which were especially needed to retake New Granada and defend the Viceroyalty of Peru, would never arrive. Furthermore, as the royalists' situation became more desperate in region after region, the army experienced wholesale defections of units to the patriot side. Politically, the reinstitution of a liberal regime changed the terms under which the Spanish government sought to engage the insurgents. The new government naively assumed that the insurgents were fighting for Spanish liberalism and that the Spanish Constitution could still be the basis of reconciliation between the two sides. The government implemented the Constitution and held elections in the overseas provinces, just as in Spain. It also ordered military commanders to begin armistice negotiations with the insurgents with the promise that they could participate in the restored representative government.Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 335‚Äì340. Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 194‚Äì195. Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 89. New Spain and Central America In effect, the Spanish Constitution of 1812 adopted by the Cortes of C√°diz served as the basis for independence in New Spain and Central America, since in both regions it was a coalition of conservative and liberal royalist leaders who led the establishment of new states. The Spanish Constitution of 1812 attempted to return to the policies that the Spanish government had implemented under Habsburg rule. These policies gave recognized Spanish colonial territory as fellow kingdoms with equal standing to Spain. The policies under the Habsburgs, moreover, allowed for constant revisionism, through corruption and the sale of office, that provided the opportunity to grant more rights and change policy to respond to the demands of the populations. The restoration of the Spanish Constitution and representative government was enthusiastically welcomed in New Spain and Central America. Elections were held, local governments formed and deputies sent to the Cortes. The Spanish Constitution of 1812 could have been an opportunity to enact social change slowly and without the threat of a radicalized uprising from the lower social classes by offering an opportunity to enact change that those in power would believe would best benefit their respective territories. Among liberals, however, there was fear that the new regime would not last; and conservatives and the Church worried that the new liberal government would expand its reforms and anti-clerical legislation. Yet, because the Cortes of C√°diz was located in Spain, political and economic power and decisions were localized in Spain, effectively giving them control over all of colonial Latin America. These tensions further frustrated many Spanish-Americans because of their inability to control the politics that directly affected their economic and sociopolitical wellbeing, further leading them towards independence. This climate of instability created the conditions for the two sides to forge an alliance. This alliance coalesced towards the end of 1820 behind Agust√≠n de Iturbide, a colonel in the royal army, who at the time was assigned to destroy the guerrilla forces led by Vicente Guerrero.Lynch analyzes the events through the older theory of a \\"conservative revolution\\": Spanish American Revolutions, 319‚Äì320.

Oil painting by Rom√°n Sagredo, collection of the Museo Nacional de Historia, INAH, M√©xico). In January 1821, Iturbide began peace negotiations with Guerrero, suggesting they unite to establish an independent New Spain. The simple terms that Iturbide proposed became the basis of the Plan of Iguala: the independence of New Spain (now to be called the Mexican Empire) with Ferdinand VII or another Bourbon as emperor; the retention of the Catholic Church as the official state religion and the protection of its existing privileges; and the equality of all New Spaniards, whether immigrants or native-born. The following month the other important guerrilla leader, Guadalupe Victoria, joined the alliance, and on March 1 Iturbide was proclaimed head of a new Army of the Three Guarantees. The representative of the new Spanish government, Superior Political Chief Juan O'Donoj√∫, who replaced the previous viceroys, arrived in Veracruz on July 1, 1821, but he found that royalists held the entire country except for Veracruz, Mexico City and Acapulco. Since at the time that O'Donoj√∫ had left Spain, the Cortes was considering greatly expanding the autonomy of the overseas Spanish possessions, O'Donoj√∫ proposed to negotiate a treaty with Iturbide on the terms of the Plan of Iguala. The resulting Treaty of C√≥rdoba, which was signed on August 24, kept all existing laws, including the 1812 Constitution, in force until a new constitution for Mexico could be written. O'Donoj√∫ became part of the provisional governing junta until his death on October 8. Both the Spanish Cortes and Ferdinand VII rejected the Treaty of C√≥rdoba, and the final break with the mother country came on May 19, 1822, when the Mexican Congress conferred the throne on Iturbide.Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 320‚Äì323. Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 206‚Äì210. Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 98‚Äì99. Guardino, \\"The War of Independence in Guerrero,\\" 121, 124‚Äì125. Central America gained its independence along with New Spain. On September 15, 1821, an Act of Independence was signed in Guatemala City which declared Central America (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica) independent from Spain. The regional elites supported the terms of the Plan of Iguala and orchestrated the union of Central America with the Mexican Empire in 1821. Two years later, following Iturbide's downfall, the region, with the exception of Chiapas, peacefully seceded from Mexico on July 1, 1823, establishing the Federal Republic of Central America. The new state existed for seventeen years, centrifugal forces pulling the individual provinces apart by 1840.Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 333‚Äì340. Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 210‚Äì213. Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 100, 146‚Äì149. South America engaged in the liberation of Peru and sailed as far as to Baja California raiding Spanish ships. Unlike in New Spain and Central America, in South America independence was spurred by the pro- independence fighters who had held out for the past half decade. Jos√© de San Mart√≠n and Sim√≥n Bol√≠var inadvertently led a continent-wide pincer movement from southern and northern South America that liberated most of the Spanish American nations on that continent. After securing the independence of Chile in 1818, San Mart√≠n concentrated on building a naval fleet in the Pacific to counter Spanish control of those waters and reach the royalist stronghold of Lima. By mid-1820 San Mart√≠n had assembled a fleet of eight warships and sixteen transport ships under the command of Admiral Cochrane. The fleet set sail from Valpara√≠so to Paracas in southern Peru. On September 7, the army landed at Paracas and successfully took Pisco. After this, San Mart√≠n, waiting for a generalized Peruvian revolt, chose to avoid direct military confrontation. San Mart√≠n hoped that his presence would initiate an authentic Peruvian revolt against Spanish rule, believing that otherwise any liberation would be ephemeral. In the meantime, San Mart√≠n engaged in diplomacy with Viceroy Joaqu√≠n de la Pezuela, who was under orders from the constitutional government to negotiate on the basis of the 1812 Constitution and to maintain the unity of the Spanish Monarchy. However, these efforts proved fruitless, since independence and unity of the monarchy could not be reconciled, so the army sailed in late October to a better strategic position in Huacho, in northern Peru. During the next few months, successful land and naval campaigns against the royalists secured the new foothold, and it was at Huacho that San Mart√≠n learned that Guayaquil (in Ecuador) had declared independence on October 9.Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 172‚Äì178. Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 213‚Äì214. Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 76. Bol√≠var, learning about the collapse of the C√°diz expedition, spent the year 1820 preparing a liberating campaign in Venezuela. Bol√≠var was aided by Spain's new policy of seeking engagement with the insurgents, which Morillo implemented, renouncing to the command in chief, and returning to Spain. Although Bol√≠var rejected the Spanish proposal that the patriots rejoin Spain under the Spanish Constitution, the two sides established a six-month truce and the regularization of the rules of engagement under the law of nations on November 25 and 26. The truce did not last six months. It was apparent to all that the royalist cause had been greatly weakened by the lack of reinforcements. Royalist soldiers and whole units began to desert or defect to the patriots in large numbers. On January 28, 1821, the ayuntamiento of Maracaibo declared the province an independent republic that chose to join the new nation-state of Gran Colombia. Miguel de la Torre, who had replaced Morillo as head of the army, took this to be a violation of the truce, and although the republicans argued that Maracaibo had switched sides of its own volition, both sides began to prepare for renewed war. The fate of Venezuela was sealed when Bol√≠var returned there in April leading an army of 7,000 from New Granada. At the Battle of Carabobo on June 24, the Gran Colombian forces decisively defeated the royalist forces, assuring control of Venezuela save for Puerto Cabello and guaranteeing Venezuelan independence. Bol√≠var could now concentrate on Gran Colombia's claims to southern New Granada and Quito.Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 218‚Äì219. Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 219. Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 88‚Äì90. Battle of Carabobo, painting by Mart√≠n Tovar y Tovar In Peru, on January 29, 1821, Viceroy Pezuela was deposed in a coup d'√©tat by Jos√© de la Serna, but it would be two months before San Mart√≠n moved his army closer to Lima by sailing it to Anc√≥n. During the next few months San Mart√≠n once again engaged in negotiations, offering the creation of an independent monarchy; but La Serna insisted on the unity of the Spanish monarchy, so the negotiations came to nothing. By July La Serna judged his hold on Lima to be weak, and on July 8 the royal army abandoned the coastal city in order to reinforce positions in the highlands, with Cuzco as new capital of the viceroyalty. On the 12th San Mart√≠n entered Lima, where he was declared \\"Protector of the Country\\" on July 28, an office which allowed him to rule the newly independent state.Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 178‚Äì179. Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 214‚Äì219. Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 76‚Äì77. Battle of Lake Maracaibo in 1823 resulted in the final expulsion of the Spanish from Gran Colombia To ensure that the Presidency of Quito became a part of Gran Colombia and did not remain a collection of small, divided republics, Bol√≠var sent aid in the form of supplies and an army under Antonio Jos√© de Sucre to Guayaquil in February 1821. For a year Sucre was unable to take Quito, and by November both sides, exhausted, signed a ninety-day armistice. The following year, at the Battle of Pichincha on May 24, 1822, Sucre's Venezuelan forces finally conquered Quito; Gran Colombia's hold on the territory was secure. The following year, after a Peruvian patriot army was destroyed in the Battle of Ica, San Mart√≠n met with Sim√≥n Bol√≠var in Guayaquil on July 26 and 27. Thereafter San Mart√≠n decided to retire from the scene. For the next two years, two armies of Rioplatense (Argentinian), Chilean, Colombian and Peruvian patriots were destroyed trying to penetrate the royalist bastion in the Andean regions of Peru and Upper Peru. A year later a Peruvian congress resolved to make Bol√≠var head of the patriot forces in the country. An internecine conflict between La Serna and General Pedro Antonio Ola√±eta, which was an extension of the Liberal Triennium, proved to be the royalists' undoing. La Serna lost control of half of his best army by the beginning of 1824, giving the patriots an opportunity.Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 185‚Äì189, 247‚Äì249, 267‚Äì272.

Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 77‚Äì78, 90‚Äì95. The Battle of Ayacucho, in Peru, ensured the independence of South America in 1824 Under the command of Bol√≠var and Sucre, the experienced veterans of the combined army, mainly Colombians, destroyed a royalist army under La Serna's command in the Battle of Ayacucho on December 9, 1824. La Serna's army was numerically superior but consisted of mostly new recruits. The only significant royalist area remaining on the continent was the highland country of Upper Peru. Following the Battle of Ayacucho, the royalist troops of Upper Peru under the command of Ola√±eta surrendered after he died in Tumusla on April 2, 1825. Bol√≠var tended to favor maintaining the unity of Upper Peru with Peru, but the Upper Peruvian leaders‚Äîmany former royalists, like Casimiro Ola√±eta, nephew of General Ola√±eta‚Äîgathered in a congress under Sucre's auspices supported the country's independence. Bol√≠var left the decision to Sucre, who went along with the congress. Sucre proclaimed Upper Peru's independence in the city which now bears his name on August 6, bringing the main wars of independence to an end.

As it became clear that there was to be no reversal of Spanish American independence, several of the new states began to receive international recognition. Early, in 1822, the United States recognized Chile, the United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata, Peru, Gran Colombia, and Mexico. Britain waited until 1825, after the Battle of Ayacucho, to recognize Mexico, Gran Colombia, and R√≠o de la Plata. Both nations recognized more Spanish American states in the next few years.Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 105‚Äì106. Last royalist bastions Battle of Tampico in 1829 The Spanish coastal fortifications in Veracruz, Callao and Chilo√© were the footholds that resisted until 1825 and 1826 respectively. In the following decade, royalist guerrillas continued to operate in several countries and Spain launched a few attempts to retake parts of the Spanish American mainland. In 1827 Colonel Jos√© Arizabalo started an irregular war with Venezuelan guerrillas, and Brigadier Isidro Barradas led the last attempt with regular troops to reconquer Mexico in 1829. The Pincheira brothers moved to Patagonia and remained there as multiethnic royalist outlaws gang until defeated in 1832. But efforts like these did not reverse the new political situation. The increasing irrelevance of the Holy Alliance after 1825 and the fall of the Bourbon dynasty in France in 1830 during the July Revolution eliminated the principal support of Ferdinand VII in Europe, but it was not until the king's death in 1833 that Spain finally abandoned all plans of military reconquest, and in 1836 its government went so far as to renounce sovereignty over all of continental America. During the course of the 19th century, Spain would recognize each of the new states.Costeloe, Michael P. Response to Revolution, 100 Only Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule, until the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898. Effects of independenceEconomics= The nearly decade and a half of wars greatly weakened the Spanish American economies and political institutions, which hindered the region's potential economic development for most of the nineteenth century and resulted in the enduring instability the region experienced. Independence destroyed the de facto trade bloc that was the Spanish Empire - Manila galleons and Spanish treasure fleets in particular. After independence, trade among the new Spanish American nations was less than it had been in the colonial period. Once the ties were broken, the small populations of most of the new nations provided little incentive to entice Spanish American producers to recreate the old trade patterns. In addition, the protection against European competition, which the Spanish monopoly had provided to the manufacturing sectors of the economy, ended. Due to expediency, protective tariffs for these sectors, in particular textile production, were permanently dropped and foreign imports beat out local production. This greatly affected Native communities, which in many parts of Spanish America, specialized in supplying finished products to the urban markets, albeit using pre-industrial techniques. The wars also greatly affected the principal economic sector of the region, mining. Silver production in Bolivia halved after independence and it dropped by three quarters in Mexico.Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 344‚Äì347. Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 245. Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 131‚Äì136. Cities dependent on seaborne trade like Valdivia plunged into depression as the intracolonial trade system collapsed. Foreign trade policies varied among the new countries, some like the United Provinces of R√≠o de la Plata and Peru applied initially protectionist policies while Chile was more open to foreign trade while still applying a kind of neomercantilism.Salazar, Gabriel; Pinto, Julio (2002). Historia contempor√°nea de Chile III. La econom√≠a: mercados empresarios y trabajadores. LOM Ediciones. pp. 19‚Äì21. The new states that began to take root in Latin America, particularly Mexico, often courted foreign financial support from European nations.√Åvila, Alfredo; Tutino, John, \\"Becoming MexicoThe Conflictive Search for a North American Nation\\", New CountriesCapitalism, Revolutions, and Nations in the Americas, 1750-1870, Duke University Press, , retrieved 2020-01-13 This foreign investment often came via loans, which only continued to cripple economies that had been destroyed or left alone during conflict. This investment was not enough to support economic recovery and can be considered to have only further negatively impacted economic growth in these newly developing states by pushing them further into debt in an attempt to recover and grow their economies. As the newly independent nations finally entered the world economy after the end of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, when the economies of Europe and the United States were recovering and aggressively seeking new markets to sell their products after more than two decades of disruption. Ultimately Spanish America could only connect to the world markets as an exporter of raw materials and a consumer of finished products.Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 343‚Äì344. Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 244‚Äì245. Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 133‚Äì136. =Society= Independence from the Spanish crown required solidarity across all social classes. However, each social faction had their ideas of what local society should and would look like after independence. This impacted the ability for societies to easily integrate because of the disunity of their ideas of future political systems and ideologies, which resulted in more conflict when it came to state consolidation. The power which the elite Creole class commanded allowed them to control state and national development to ensure that they remained in power. As a result, the newly forming Latin American states would fulfill some of the demands of other social factions to ensure the stability and integration of all into the social fabric of a new state while guaranteeing the continual reproduction of the Creole elite into position of power and control over the rest of society. The political debate seeking answers to these questions was marked by a clash between liberalism and conservatism. Conservatives sought to maintain the traditional social structures in order to ensure stability; liberals sought to create a more dynamic society and economy by ending ethnically-based social distinctions and freeing property from economic restrictions. In its quest to transform society, liberals often adopted policies that were not welcome by Native communities, who had benefited from unique protections afforded to them by traditional Spanish law.Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 347‚Äì351. Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 245. Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 142‚Äì143. Independence, however, did initiate the abolition of slavery in Spanish America, as it was seen as part of the independence struggle, since many slaves had gained their manumission by joining the patriot armies. In areas where slavery was not a major source of labor (Mexico, Central America, Chile), emancipation occurred almost immediately after independence was achieved. In areas where slavery was a main labor source (Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Argentina), emancipation was carried out in steps over the next three decades, usually first with the creation of free- womb laws and programs for compensated emancipation. By the early 1850s, slavery had been abolished in the independent nations of Spanish America.Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 347‚Äì349. =Role of women= Juana Azurduy de Padilla, a Mestiza leader of independence in Rio de la Plata. Women were not simply spectators throughout the Independence Wars of Latin America. Many women took sides on political issues and joined independence movements in order to participate on many different levels. Women could not help but act as caring relatives either as mother, sister, wives or daughters of the men who were fighting. Women created political organizations and organized meetings and groups to donate food and supplies to the soldiers. Some women supported the wars as spies, informants and combatants. Manuela S√°enz was a long term lover of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var and acted as his spy and confidante and was secretary of his archive. She saved his life on two occasions, nursed wounded soldiers and has even been believed some historians to have fought in a few battles. S√°enz followed Bol√≠var and his army through the independence wars and became known in Latin America as the ‚Äúmother of feminism and women's emancipation and equal rights.‚Äù Bol√≠var himself was a supporter of women's rights and suffrage in Latin America. It was Bol√≠var who allowed for S√°enz to become the great pioneer of women's freedom. He wanted to set the women of Latin America free from the oppression and inferiority of what the Spanish regime had established. Bol√≠var even made S√°enz a Colonel of the Colombian Army due to her heroics which caused controversy because there were no women in the army at the time. Another woman who gained prominence in the fight for independence was Juana Azurduy de Padilla, a mixed-race woman who fought for independence in the R√≠o de la Plata region. Argentine President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner posthumously promoted her to the rank of general.The Argentine President promotes Juana Azurduy to General in the Argentine Army. http://www.szmm.gov.hu/download.php?ctag=download&docID;=14380 According to gender stereotypes, women were not meant to be soldiers; only men were supposed to engage in fighting and conflict. There were still plenty of women present on the battlefields to help rescue and nurse soldiers. Some women fought alongside their husbands and sons on the battlefield. The majority of women assumed supportive and non-competitive roles such as fundraising and caring for the sick. Revolution for women meant something different than for men. Women saw revolution as a way to earn equal rights, such as voting, and to overcome the suppression of subordination of women to men. Women were usually identified as victims during the independence wars since the women of Latin America were forced to sacrifice for the cause. The ideals of womanhood meant that women must sacrifice what the situation required such as a mother sacrificing her son or a virgin knowing she might be sacrificing motherhood or marriage due to the loss of many young men. This view meant that women were meant to contribute to independence in a supportive role while leaving the combat and politics in the hands of the men.‚Äù O‚ÄôConnor, Mothers Making Latin America‚Äù, 26-27. =Government and politics= Map of territories that became independent during those wars (blue) Independence also did not result in stable political regimes, save in a few countries. First, the new nations did not have well-defined identities, but rather the process of creating identities was only beginning. This would be carried out through newspapers and the creation of national symbols, including new names for the countries (\\"Mexico\\", \\"Colombia\\", \\"Ecuador\\", \\"Bolivia\\", \\"Argentina\\"), that broke with the past. In addition, the borders were not firmly established, and the struggle between federalism and centralism, which began in independence, continued throughout the rest of the century. Two large states that emerged from the wars‚ÄîGran Colombia and the Federal Republic of Central America‚Äîcollapsed after a decade or two, and Argentina would not consolidate politically until the 1860s.Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 342‚Äì343. Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 146‚Äì152. The wars destroyed the old civilian bureaucracy that had governed the region for centuries, as institutions such as the audiencias were eliminated and many Peninsular officials fled to Spain. The Catholic Church, which had been an important social and political institution during the colonial period, initially came out weakened by the end of the conflicts. As with government officials, many Peninsular bishops abandoned their dioceses and their posts were not filled for decades until new prelates could be created and relations between the new nations and the Vatican were regularized. Then as the Church recovered, its economic and political power was attacked by liberals.Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 351‚Äì352. Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 145‚Äì146, 152‚Äì153. Despite the fact that the period of the wars of independence itself was marked by a rapid expansion of representative government,Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 3‚Äì5, 213, 239. Kinsbruner states, \\"[I]n Mexico between 1820 and 1835 a larger percentage of adult males were permitted to vote than was the case in the United States, Great Britain, or France.\\" Independence in Spanish America, 90. for several of the new nations the nineteenth century was marked by militarism because of the lack of well- defined political and national institutions. The armies and officers that came into existence during the process of independence wanted to ensure that they got their rewards once the struggle was over. Many of these armies did not fully disband once the wars were over and they proved to be one of the stabler institutions in the first decades of national existence. These armies and their leaders effectively influenced the course of political development. Out of this new tradition came the caudillos, strongmen who amassed formal and informal economic, military and political power in themselves.Lynch, Spanish American Revolutions, 341‚Äì342, 352‚Äì355. Rodr√≠guez, Independence of Spanish America, 219‚Äì222, 240‚Äì244. Kinsbruner, Independence in Spanish America, 143‚Äì144. Foreign supportGreat Britain= The Chilean navy led by Thomas Cochrane capturing the Spanish frigate Esmeralda on the night of 5 November 1820 Britain wanted to see an end to Spanish rule in South America and ultimately tap the monopoly of the important potential markets there. At the same time they wanted Spain as an ally to keep the balance of power in post Napoleonic Europe. In order to fulfil this, Britain went covert in support of the Revolutionaries in South America. In a kind of private free enterprise going by the law, she sent men, financial and material support to help the insurgents fight against Spain.Baeza Ruz, Andr√©s (2017). \\"Imperio, Estado y Naci√≥n en las relaciones entre chilenos y brit√°nicos durante el proceso de independencia hispanoamericano, 1806-1831\\", pp 71-72 One of the most significant contributions were the British Legions, a volunteer unit that fought under Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. This force numbered upwards of 6,000 men - the majority of whom were composed of veterans of the Napoleonic wars.Arana, M., 2013, Bolivar, New York: Simon & Schuster, In combat their greatest achievements were at Boyac√° (1819), Carabobo (1821), Pichincha (1822) and Ayacucho (1824) which secured independence for Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador and Peru from Spanish rule respectively. Bol√≠var described the Legions and all who served in them as \\"the saviours of my country\\". Many members of the Royal Navy also volunteered for the revolutionary forces. The most famous being Thomas Cochrane who reorganised the Chilean navy, most of whom were composed of Royal Navy veterans. Amongst many feats he he captured the Spanish fortress of Valdivia in 1820; and in the same year he captured the flagship of the Spanish South American fleet, the Esmeralda, in the port of Callao. As well as helping Chile gain independence from Spain Cochrane did the same for Peru too by mounting an effective blockade and transporting troops. He then moved on to Brazil in their fight for independence from Portugal. At their peak by 1819 around 10,000 men from the British Isles served in South America to fight against the Spanish. British diplomacy also played a key role; in particular the role of foreign secretaries Viscount Castlereagh and later George Canning both of whom wanted to see the demise of Spain's South American colonies. Castlereagh's greatest achievement was to settle a deal with the European powers at the Congress of Aix-La-Chapelle in 1818 and the Congress of Verona four years later. This blocked aid to Spain which inhibited her reconquest of South America. With the Royal Navy in command of the oceans this set the precedence - they were also a decisive factor in the struggle for independence of certain Latin American countries. = United States = The intervention of the United States was due two distinct causes a territorial annexattion and a revolts within the Spanish territories itself.Joseph Smith, The United States and Latin America: A History of American Diplomacy, 1776-2000 (2005) pp 3-18.Thomas Leonard, et al. Encyclopedia of US-Latin American relations (CQ Press, 2012). The Republic of West Florida was a short-lived republic in 1810 in the western-most region of Spanish West Florida, which after less than three months was annexed and occupied by the United States a little later in 1810, and then became part of the territory of Louisiana. The Republic of East Florida was another republic declared against Spanish rule of East Florida by insurgents who wanted its annexation by the United States without success. In 1819, the Treaty of Florida was signed between Spain and the United States, and Spain ceded all of Florida to the United States. In 1811, the Spanish crushed the San Antonio (Texas) revolt during the revolution against the royalists in the Mexican War of Independence. The remaining rebels then turned to the United States for help. Bernardo Guti√©rrez de Lara traveled to Washington, D.C. Gutierrez gained the support of Augustus Magee and formed a U.S. filibuster force in Louisiana. A green flag from the expedition represented the rebels. The Northern Republican Army was defeated in the bloodiest battle in Texas, the Battle of Medina. Thus, Texas was incorporated into the Mexican Independence, and later Texas Independence and its annexation to the United States took place. The United States remained neutral. Thus, for the rest of Madison's term, until 1817, the theoretical neutrality pending the development of events in the Old World. The point is, Madison's policy of neutrality favored insurgents and this, along with the border-line problems in North America, led to a situation of pre-war tension with Spain. This situation forced the United States to act very cautiously in the Spanish- American issue, since it was trying to avoid at all costs to give an excuse for European intervention. At the end, the recognition in 1822 also was very delicate, at the international level the North American position against European powers. = Russia = The Spanish navy had been totally dismantled by a disastrous naval policy and relegated to the background by the urgency of the war against Napoleon itself. To 1817, Tsar Alexander supported reactionary governments. Ferdinand VII applied to the Tsar to purchase vessels. The Tsar agree this request with the offer of the sale of some of his own vessels. The agreement was finally negotiated at Madrid, between Dmitry Tatishchev, Russian ambassador, and Eguia, Minister of war. It was apparently known only to these two, and to the king himself. The text of the treaty of sale has not been found in the Spanish Naval archives. This diplomatic transaction was veiled in the deepest secrecy against Spanish Navy and Minister of Navy.Russell H. Bartley, Imperial Russia and the Struggle for Latin American Independence, 1808‚Äì1828 (1978), ch. 3. The requested fleet would consist of 5 warships and 3 frigates. The squadron would be delivered to Cadiz, duly armed, and supplied. The arrival of the Russian fleet in Cadiz in February 1818 was not to the liking of the Spanish navy, which was dissatisfied with the state of deterioration in which some supposedly new ships were found: between 1820 and 1823 all the Warships were scrapped as being useless. This fiasco put an end to the whole plan to reconquer the Rio de la Plata, which would end with the uprising of the Spanish Army in Cadiz (Trienio Liberal). In 1818 one of the frigates (Maria Isabel aka Patrikki) was captured in the Pacific, after the uprising of one of the Spanish troop transports that went over to the side of the American rebels delivering all the keys, routes and signals for the capture of the frigate. Only two of the Russian frigates provided important services in the Caribbean in defense of the island of Cuba, although they only made the one-way trip, they got lost, sunk when they arrived in Havana. = Portuguese Empire = After a long colonial dispute between Spain, and to avoid insurgency in this disputed territory, the Portuguese government organized an Army to defend the city of Montevideo against the revolutionaries (1811) and to annexed the disputed territory of Banda Oriental against Spain (1816). In 1811, the first Portuguese invasion took place in support of the besieged city of Montevideo. The Portuguese invasion forces were commanded by the governor and captain general of the Captaincy of R√≠o Grande de San Pedro, Diego de Souza (Diogo de Souza), and their declared objective was to help Montevideo and the viceroy of the R√≠o de la Plata, Francisco Javier de El√≠o, who was besieged by revolutionary forces from the United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata. The invasion included clashes with eastern forces led by Jos√© Gervasio Artigas. After an ephemeral agreement, the Portuguese did not completely abandon the occuped territory. In 1816, the second Portuguese Invasion or War against Artigas, giving rise to the armed conflict that took place between 1816 and 1820 in the entire territory of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, in the Argentine Mesopotamia and southern Brazil, and which resulted in the annexation of the Banda Oriental to the Portuguese Empire, with the name of Cisplatina Province. This annexation broke relations with Spain, which prepared an army in Spain to recover Montevideo and invade the R√≠o de la Plata, but this project ended up in rebellion of entire Army in 1820 in C√°diz. Portugal tries to ensure its annexation by being the first country to grant international recognition of the independence of Latin American Republics on 1821.

The purposes for glossolalic singing are the same as those of non-glossolalic singing, including praise, thanksgiving (1 Corinthians 14:15-17), and petition (Romans 8:26-27) to God. Singing in the Spirit may be done solo or together as a congregation during a worship service. Some Pentecostals and charismatics believe if it is done by an individual, as opposed to the congregation as a whole, then the song should be interpreted by one with the gift of interpretation (the interpretation also being in song form).Robert Graves, \\"Singing in the Spirit\\", Pneuma Review Vol. 4 No. 2 (Spring 2001). On congregational singing in the Spirit, Donald Hustad describes a pattern observed in Pentecostal and charismatic churches in which, during worship, someone begins to utter musical sounds, which may or may not have recognizable words. Other members of the congregation join in and, although there is no particular effort to match the pitch or the words, the overall effect is harmonious. \\"It is as if the strings of a huge Aeolian harp have been set in motion by the wind of the Holy Spirit. The beautiful sound rises in volume, lasts for a longer or shorter period, and then gradually dies away.\\"Donald Hustad, \\"The Historical Roots of Music in the Pentecostal and Neo-Pentecostal Movements\\", The Hymn: A Journal of Congregational Song 38 (January 1987), p7.

The vernacular name in China is Â∑ùËµ§Ëäç (chuan chi shao). This species is ¬Ω-1 m high, has a thick irregular taproot and thin side roots, and deeply incised leaves, with leaflets themselves divided in fine segments. It has two to four fully developed flowers per stem, that may be pink to magenta-red or rarely almost white. It is known from central China.  Description  Paeonia veitchii is a non-woody species of peony of ¬Ω‚Äì1 m high, with an irregular carrot-shaped taproot of over ¬Ω m long and 2 cm thick, gradually getting thinner downwards and slender side roots. It has 10 chromosomes (2n=10). = Leaves and Stems = The leaves have no sheath or stipules and are alternately arranged along the stem, are divided into a leaf stalk and leaf blade. The leaf blade is twice compounded or very deeply incised, first into three leaflets, themselves palmately compounded or deeply divided (this is called biternate), each leaflet being further divided into segments that themselves are lobed, resulting in seventy to one hundred segments of ¬æ-3¬º cm wide. = Inflorescence = Between two and four hermaphrodite flowers fully develop on each stem, while several flowerbuds are arrested in their development, and two to five leaflike bracts are present. The flowers are somewhat nodding. Each flower has three to five leathery sepals that mostly end in a stretched tip, making it \\"leafy\\", but sometimes one and rarely two sepals may be obovate with a rounded tip, which do not fall after flowering. The corolla usually consists of six to nine oblong cyclamen to pink or rarely white petals of 3-6¬Ω √ó 1¬Ω-3 cm. Towards the centre of the flower are many stamens consisting of filaments of ¬Ω‚Äì1 cm topped with anthers that ripen from the inside out, open with slits and release yellow pollen. The pollen is released in sets of four grains together. Petals and stamens are shed after flowering. The two to five carpels are initially pale yellow with reddish stigmas, but eventually become green, may be hairless or covered in soft felty hairs. Within, several large, initially red but eventually shiny black seeds of 6√ó4 mm develop, and each carpel opens by a slit over the entire length. = Differences with related species = Few other peony species are non-woody and have finely segmented leaves. Paeonia tenuifolia has even more divided leaves with narrowed segments of up to 6 mm wide, the basal leaves consisting of more than one hundred and thirty segments. P. veitchii however strongly resembles Paeonia intermedia, from which it can be distinguished because the latter has many spindle-shaped roots and at least the two innermost sepals are rounded. Even more morphologically alike is Paeonia anomala, which differs only from this species because it usually has only one, rarely two flowers per stem in addition to two undeveloped buds, rather than two to four fully developed flowers, in addition to few undeveloped buds.  Taxonomy  Taxonomic history = Paeonia veitchi was first described by Lynch in 1909, based on a specimen collected by Ernest Henry Wilson, who collected plants for James Veitch & Sons. According to Hong and Pan, hairiness of the fruits varies in both P. anomala and P. veitchii and the only character that consistently differs between the two taxa is the usual number of fully developing flowers per stem: one for P. anomala and two to four in P. veitchii. This was the reason to propose to reduce the status of these taxa to P. anomala ssp. anomala and P. anomala ssp. veitchii respectively. = Modern classification = Although some modern literature still regards P. veitchii as a subspecies of P. anomala, recent genetic analysis has shown that P. anomala, although being a diploid, is the result of a cross between Paeonia lactiflora and P. veitchii. Morphologically, P. anomala is very similar to P. veitchii nonetheless. These species also share a common chemistry, such as specific unique anthocyanins. = Etymology = The subspecies veitchii has been named after James Veitch & Sons, a firm that contributed to the exploration of new plant species by employing plant hunters.  Distribution and ecology  P. veitchii is an endemic of China, where it occurs naturally in eastern Qinghai, southern Ningxia, southeastern and central Gansu, southern Shaanxi, Shanxi, western Sichuan and the eastern rim of Tibet. It prefers relatively moist locations such as forest, grassy forest margins, between shrubs and on alpine meadows at 1800‚Äì3900 m altitude. The hermaphrodite flowers are pollinated by insects. This peony is self-fertile.

The downstream gas is saturated with water, so even though significant amounts of water may have been removed from the cooled gas, it is likely to leave a visible stack plume of water vapor. The heat recovery potential of flue gas condensation is highest for fuels with a high moisture content (e.g. biomass and municipal waste), and where heat is useful at the lowest possible temperatures. Thus flue gas condensation is normally implemented at biomass fired boilers and waste incinerators connected district heating grids with relatively low return temperatures (below approximately ).  Efficiency exceeding 100 % Flue gas condensation may cause the heat recovered to exceed the Lower Heating Value of the input fuel, and thus an efficiency greater than 100%. Since historically most combustion processes have not condensed the fuel, usual efficiency calculations assume the combustion products are not condensed. This assumption is implicit when basing calculations on the Lower Heating Value. A more rigorous approach would be to base efficiency calculations on the Higher Heating Value, which typically results in efficiencies less than 100%. Should the flue gases be cooled below , even efficiencies based on the Higher Heating Value may exceed 100%, since typical heating value definitions assume that all heat is released when combustion products are cooled to somewhere between and .

It chronicles the demise of a group of individuals living in New York's Hell's Kitchen around the time before Rudy Giuliani's efforts to clean up the city. Out of work and strapped for money, the lives of these individuals revolve around a local bar and their misguided hopes and dreams. The play deals primarily with issues of commercialism, hope, and friendship. Plot Lenny is a recently released ex-convict. Despite his imposing size, he was gang raped repeatedly while incarcerated and struggles to find his manhood on the outside. Daisy, his alcoholic girlfriend, craves a ‚Äúreal‚Äù life with a ‚Äúreal‚Äù man and abandons him at a seedy pre-Giuliani Times Square bar in pursuit of some cheap Chinese takeout. At the bar is Skank, a former failed actor turned junkie, who is trying to outlast the rain storm and get a buyback from the long-missing Irish bartender as he begins to go through withdrawals. Also at the bar is Sammy, an old, dying guilt-ridden drunk who exists somewhere between reality and the afterlife. DeMaris, a seventeen-year- old gun-brandishing single mother, wants to learn to turn tricks. She enlists the aid of Chickie, Skank‚Äôs girlfriend, a young crackhead hooker who plays Go Fish with the simple-minded day bartender Charlie, who thinks he‚Äôs a Jedi warrior and who buys meals for Chickie because he loves her and because he lives for the day they can go out someday, ‚Äújust as friends.‚Äù The owner of the bar is Jake. The place was his father‚Äôs before him, and after thirty years, he longs for the chance to leave ‚Äúthis sewer‚Äù for a re-invented life in Florida. The real-estate boom, ‚Äúgentrification‚Äù and the emergence of Disney in Times Square affords him that opportunity. Unaware that their last piece of home is about to be pulled out from under them, the bar patrons struggle on. Their sense of humor, their misguided hopes and dreams, and their lack of self-pity are badges that are tattooed to their souls. They will all, before the end, demand and take the chance to face head on their complicated and sad truths. Characters Chickie and Skank, are a pair of crackheads. Charlie, a retarded barman, who sees himself as a Jedi fighter from Star Wars. And Demaris, a 17-year-old apprentice hooker, craves security for herself and her baby. Lenny, a hoodlum, goes for an unlikely job interview as an on-site field marketeer which actually involves handing out flyers.

The building was chartered as the Norfolk Village Hall, although it was commonly known as the Norfolk Opera House. It was designed by the architect George Palliser, from Bridgeport, Connecticut, who published its design in his book, Palliser's Court Houses, Village, Town and City Halls, Jails and Plans of Other Public Buildings (1889). The Norfolk Opera House hosted vaudeville and theatrical presentations until the late 1940s. For the following four decades, it was used as a restaurant and a grocery store. The building was closed in 1994 and remained vacant for four years. In 1998 Kimberly Gelvin- Melville (now Kimberly Gelvin-Wilks) was given \\"right to first refusal\\" to try to get the townspeople or someone else to buy and restore the old opera house as a theater and not apartments or offices. She then produced a theater play in the dead of winter to try to draw public awareness of this glorious opera house she wished to run her own theater company in with the help of Trustees. The Four Poster was produced at The White Hart Inn in Salisbury and the Smithies saw the article in the tristate paper, Litchfield Times, about the building and Kimberly Gelvin-Melville's desire to save it. She gave the Smithies permission to purchase it because they liked all of her ideas to turn it back into a theater and run shops downstairs to help finance it. In 1998, the building was purchased by playwrights and theater producers Maura Cavanaugh and Richard Smithies for US$50,000, who undertook a US$650,000 restoration that included the rebuilding of an observation tower that was part of the original structure. Cavanaugh and Smithies renamed the venue the Greenwoods Theater and brought dramatic and musical productions to its stage. Mr. Smithie had asked Kimberly to play Cleopatra in a future production but sadly Mrs. Cavanaugh Smithie decided she did not wish to include Kimberly as a director or actress for fear of her getting the credit for their restorations. The theater was restored and Kimberly attended the opening but then returned to live in Australia with her former husband and daughter.

It has since entered into hip hop music as a meme, and has been used by artists such as Ice-T, Gravediggaz, Redman, Fabolous, Ras Kass, Jay-Z, Jedi Mind Tricks, Snoop Dogg, Goldie Lookin' Chain, Krayzie Bone, Wyclef Jean, Pusha T and Lil Wayne. It serves as a good example of the intertextual nature of the genre, where quoting older works serves as a form of homage to other artists. Origin The phrase was first used in 1987 by Boogie Down Productions's KRS-One, an early socially and politically conscious East Coast rapper. He co-produced Just-Ice's album Kool & Deadly, and contributed vocals on the track \\"Moshitup\\". KRS-One is vegetarian, and used the phrase to warn against the dangers of eating pork: The phrase has gained popularity because it just \\"sounds cool and dangerous\\". Use of the line serves as an insider's reference to KRS-One, as the phrase is further repeated. Legacy The line made its way to West Coast rap in 1991, when Ice-T used it in the song \\"Ricochet\\" from the film by the same name. Two years later it was repeated on fellow West Coast rapper Snoop Dogg's track \\"Serial Killa\\"from the album Doggystyleby RBX. It has since been used by ScarfaceOn the soundtrack to the movie The Fast and the Furious and Redman in different songs titled \\"Suicide\\", by the group Gravediggaz on the single \\"1-800 Suicide\\", and by Nelly on Fat Joe's hit single \\"Get It Poppin'\\". Welsh comedy rappers Goldie Lookin Chain, who also quote KRS-One's \\"Sound of da Police\\" in \\"Guns Don't Kill People, Rappers Do,\\" appropriated the phrase for their song \\"Self Suicide.\\" In 2008, Fabolous used it on \\"Suicide\\" from his Gangsta Grillz: There Is No Competition mixtape. The phrase entered into mainstream pop music in 2008 when it was used by Jay-Z on the remix of Coldplay's single \\"Lost!\\" (titled \\"Lost+\\"). Nas used a variation of the phrase in the song \\"Nah Mean\\" on the album Distant Relatives, using the word \\"genocide\\" instead, presumably referring to Darfur. LL Cool J's song \\"Homicide\\" from his 2000 album G.O.A.T. uses a variation of the phrase. In his track \\"Suicide\\" released on his 2013 album My Name is My Name, Pusha T also echoes the lyric. Lil Wayne used the lyric on his Dedication 6: Reloaded mixtape, in the song \\"Bloody Mary\\", which features rapper Juelz Santana.

He conveyed to the newly established county seat in 1838 for the building of a courthouse, civic buildings, and a commercial district. He then sold residential lots to individuals. His house is a two-story frame building. It was built in the Federal style and later altered with the addition of Greek Revival-influenced details. The house was recorded by the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1936. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a part of the Antebellum Homes in Eutaw Thematic Resource on April 2, 1982, due to its architectural significance.

Werner Nachmann (12 August 1925 in Karlsruhe, Germany - 21 January 1988), was a German entrepreneur and politician, and was president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany (Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland) from 1969 to 1988. In 1938 Nachmann fled to France and returned to Germany in 1945 as an officer of the French army. He established himself again in Karlsruhe, where he developed his family business. From 1961 to 1988 he was the chairman of the Jewish municipality in Karlsruhe and the advisor on mikvah affairs. In 1962 he became a member of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, in 1965 he was subsequently selected in its board of directors and from 1969 onwards he held the presidency. He is considered as an important pioneer of renewed cooperation between the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany and German-Jewish organizations. For his work Nachmann was often honored during his lifetime, but criticism rose sharply from parts of the German-Jewish community in the early seventies as some found his efforts towards Jewish-German reconciliation as lacking sufficient distance to Germany. In 1972, he served on the organizing committee of the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. He was also a member of the Israeli delegation. In 1986, he received the Theodor Heuss prize for his services to Jewish-German reconciliation and the peaceful coexistence of Jews and Christians in the Federal Republic of Germany. After his death in 1988, Nachmann was loudly condemned when it was discovered that from 1981 to 1987 he had defrauded about 33 million DM ($17 million in U.S. dollars at the time) from a German government fund intended for victims of the Nazis.\\"Nine Quit German Jewish Panel Over Scandal\\", The New York Times (December 13, 1988).

It took place in the Strait of Otranto in the Adriatic Sea, between Italy and Albania. Background The battle occurred when an Allied squadron entered the Adriatic Sea looking for Italian naval targets. Although they did not know it at the time the squadron's real purpose was to help draw enemy attention from a major action against the main Italian fleet base at Taranto (Battle of Taranto).Coulthard-Clark 1998, p. 176. The Allied squadron was commanded by Vice Admiral Henry Pridham-Whippel in the light cruiser , and included the light cruisers and and the destroyers and . On 12 November, an Italian Navy (Regia Marina) convoy of four merchant ships‚ÄîAntonio Locatelli, Premuda, Capo Vado and Catalani‚Äîwere on their way back from Valona, Albania to Brindisi, ItalyJordan 2006, p. 226. while escorted by the World War I-era torpedo boat Fabrizi, commanded by T.V.c. Giovanni Barbini and the auxiliary cruiser commanded by C.F. Francesco De Angelis. The ships were travelling darkened without navigational lights. Battle The Allied ships proceeded north during the night of 11 November, and upon reaching a notional line between Bari and Durazzo by 01:00 without incident, they turned to run southward. Twenty minutes later, the raiders encountered six darkened enemy ships, including what they thought were two destroyers and four merchantmen. The enemy vessels passed across their front and were making for the Italian mainland. HMS Mohawk opened fire at 01:27, and action became general. In a confused night time action, HMAS Sydney attacked the leading freighter at a range of , setting it on fire. Over the next 23 minutes, the other three merchantmen were either sunk or damaged and left burning. Fabrizi was hit and heavily damaged, and limped toward Valona with 11 dead and 17 wounded. Ramb III after an initial discharge of 19 salvoes from her guns broke off the action unscathed. The merchantmen were all sunk in the action. The Allies suffered no damage or casualties, although a torpedo narrowly missed Sydneys stern at 01:40. The Italians suffered 36 dead and 42 wounded. Aftermath Ramb III, the only surviving participant in the battle, is on display at Rijeka as the museum ship . The Italians retaliated by sending aircraft of the Regia Aeronautica to locate the British naval squadron; however, the CANT flying boats which eventually located the naval squadron were shot down. The Regia Marina sent motor torpedo boats located north of Valona, Cruiser Squadron 7, consisting of light cruisers , , , the 15th Destroyer Division from Brindisi, Cruiser Squadron 8, consisting of light cruisers and , with the 7th and 8th Destroyer Divisions from Taranto sailed to intercept the British naval squadron in the Otranto Straits, but they failed to make contact.

It is a multiplayer online racing game (MMORG) with partially chargeable content, or micro-transactions. It features gameplay elements such as tuning and customization. The game is titled as Level R in Europe with a slightly different game interface and menus. Europe, US, Russia, Indonesia, Thailand, China, and Japan versions, are developed by Invictus Games and are subject to Invictus copyright. Level-R was originally developed for the Japan market in 2006, which was based on CRC2005. The Level-R versions across the world will all be the same with minor physics and content tweaks. The current build, Julia, was released on June 3, 2010. The Level-R versions combined with the Project Torque version have 64 cars in total. None of the versions have all 64 cars due to licensing issues, and any version may not receive a certain car if it does not gain proper licensing. The 2019 version, however, has no licensed cars, nor does it have cars from post-2010 builds, such as the Corus R4 or certain Thunder Alley cars. As of July 31, 2010, the Project Torque service, hosted by Aeria Games Entertainment, is no longer in service. Invictus Games Ltd. signed a deal with Innologin Ltd. to publish a new North American service of Level-R, called Heat Online.Heat Online As of May 1, 2014, the HEAT Online service has been discontinued. In August 2019 fans of Level-R and Project Torque started a crowdfunding campaign for $10,000 to get the game back online. The funds were supposed to cover contract and legal fees for gaining the publishing rights to Project Torque from Invictus Games. The campaign goal was reached and in late August 2019 Jogara Ltd., a fan-run company, signed the publishing contract. In December 2019 game was re-released on Steam.  Game modes  Screenshot of the Thunder Alley Pro cars during the initial pace lap. Project Torque features various cars, some of them being licensed version of actual production cars while others are imitations. It features a variety of game modes such as Simulation, Arcade, and Thunder Alley. CTF and Drift modes were removed after the release of version \\"Julia.\\" As of March 15, 2012, the service of Level R has been shut down. = Simulation = Simulation is a mode designed to portray the realism of racing. With recent updates, the mode has become a mix of arcade and simulation mechanics. Differences from arcade mode is less forgiving steering, cosmetic and mechanical damage, and bonus points rewarded for racing in simulation mode. This mode features up to 2‚Äì8 players and a variety of tracks that can be raced on 3, 5, or 7 lap segments. = Arcade = Arcade is a mode similar to most other racing video games. Unlike simulation mode, it has an easier steering system, a \\"no collision\\" system, and no mechanical damage. This mode features up to 2‚Äì8 players and a variety of tracks that can be raced on 3, 5, or 7 lap segments. Newer players to the game will only be able to race in arcade mode until they unlock access to simulation mode tracks. = Thunder Alley = Thunder Alley is very similar to NASCAR. It is one of the most popular modes of Project Torque and includes three classes of cars: Rookie, Pro, and Intimidator. The Rookie class is similar to the NASCAR Featherlite Modified series, the Pro class to the NASCAR Sprint Cup (Car of Tomorrow car with wing), and the Intimidator class to the NASCAR Nationwide series. Thunder Alley mode provides a wind tunnel mechanic and a fuel consumption mechanic that the other racing modes lack. Currently there are two tracks for this mode, one resembling Talladega, the other Bristol. The mode features the ability to race up to 20 players, and to run up to 60 laps a race. Unlike the NASCAR series where they have caution flags, Thunder Alley has a penalty system that forces a driver to do a pass through the pit lane when the driver breaks too many violations. This system, however, has been criticized for the inaccuracy of the penalties as it would penalize a victim of another driver's faults. = Drag = Drag is a mode where 2‚Äì4 players line up in a quarter or a half mile strip to smoke some rubber and see who is the fastest racer. You have to shift manually in Drag mode, as it requires shifting at the right RPM to gain a faster run. Drag mode also features a different engine damage system, compared to other modes, which makes the engine blow up from improper shifting. A drag race session can involve multiple heat runs, and the player with the best set of heats wins. = Capture the Flag = Capture the Flag is an arena \\"cat and mouse\\" type mode played with 2‚Äì8 players. One player grabs the flag and runs through checkpoints, while other players try to grab the flag away by running into the flag carrier. The flag holder can also lose the flag by repairing, recovering, or rolling their car over. The player who scores the most points wins. Players gain points by holding the flag for long periods, running through checkpoints with the flag, or stealing the flag. = Drift = Drifting is a 2‚Äì8 player mode that uses the same tracks as simulation and arcade modes, but lap times and position do not matter. Rather the winner of a drift round is determined by how many drift points the players can score. Drift points are determined by angle (of the car in the curve), speed, length of the drift, and the drift multiplier. A unique feature of the drift mode is the ability to use specialized drifting cars, one of which resembles the Falken Mustang driven by Vaughn Gittin.  Invictus controversy  In October 2009, the developer company of Project Torque, Invictus, issued an IP ban of all non-US accounts on Project Torque. The reason is to be believed that the Europe publisher of Level-R, gamigo AG, filed a complaint concerning a breach in contract because Europe players were playing Project Torque which is claimed to be a North America only version. Aeria Games & Entertainment (AGE) had to comply with the IP ban, and as a result the player base of Project Torque dramatically decreased. Fellow users of Project Torque gathered together in an attempt to dodge the IP bans in forms of Proxies and VPN clients, but the tools used to dodge the IP Bans became blocked as well. Soon after the IP ban was issued, Invictus stated that they would no longer support the Project Torque version of their game which was very different from the Level-R version. This means that Project Torque would not receive anymore special builds from Invictus. On May 24, 2010, AGE had announced that a new build, Julia, was coming to Project Torque. CTF and Drift modes would be removed from the game, there would be a GUI refresh, and a few new modes added. However, the patch did not promise a lift of the IP ban of non-US IPs. On the morning of June 3, 2010, the Julia build was released as a current, but \\"open beta,\\" version of the game. There was much criticism from the build as it was similar to the Level-R version, and the patch removed all the unique features that had made Project Torque popular.  Reception  The game's critical reception was average. Some users have complained about the change in the steering mechanics from some builds, and the inability to sell cars. MMO Huts gave Project Torque a \\"Good\\" rating saying, \\"Project Torque is a really polished and fun racing MMO.\\" They also noted the beautiful graphics compared to other MMO games, and the solid gameplay. Users gave it a 3.99/5 rating. MMORPG Center rated Project Torque an 8.0/10. \\"Overall Project Feature is a great online racing game, played in small sessions or sometimes you will want more and more.\\" Users on MMORPG Center gave Project Torque a 9.3/10. Swift World rated Project Torque a 7/10 for great gameplay, but mentioned the lack of players during the time. Users of Swift World rated Project Torque a 9.7/10. Kei Beneza of OnRPG said, \\"If I were to judge this game, I would say that the game is a lot better than most of the racing games out there.\\" He noted that the game had great graphics, was able to run on low-end PCs, and had a simple solution to connection-lag during races.  The end  On July 8, 2010, Aeria Games announced that they could no longer support the running of Project Torque, and that the game would be completely shut down on August 2, 2010. Aeria also stated that they will hold a series of events, refund AP (Aeria cash currency) to players who had spent AP in the past 90 days, and even grant access to \\"hidden content\\" that had never been released before. On July 29, 2010, Invictus announced a new publisher for Project Torque. The game would be called HEAT Online, and would be hosted by the publisher, Innologin Ltd. The publishers are allowing people to try the game as guest accounts before registering under the Innologin service. On July 31, 2010, Aeria Games shut down the servers for Project Torque. The download for the game was taken down shortly after. On August 1, 2010, the Project Torque forums were shut down except the general discussion area. Aeria Games left open a \\"Project Torque Community\\" section on their forums for the players to stay in touch. On February 15, 2014, Invictus Games Ltd. announced that they will discontinue service of HEAT Online. On May 1, 2014, Invictus discontinued service of HEAT Online. A few months later, after HEAT Online's servers discontinuation, the download and forums for the game were taken down. An attempt by Killz Gaming community to save the game with a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign failed. The reason for this was the high amount of money needed to buy the game from Invictus Gaming. In addition, many players had already lost their account several times due to rebranding. It became clear that the community was not prepared to invest in the game once again. The Kickstart project ended on 5 September 2014 with only a few backers. It was released on Steam on 20 December 2019 References External links  * Level R Official site Category:2008 video games Category:Products and services discontinued in 2010 Category:Massively multiplayer online games Category:Racing video games Category:Video games developed in Hungary Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Inactive massively multiplayer online games ","title":"Project Torque"},{"id":"20954763","text":"MS Giulio Cesare was a luxurious ocean liner built for the Italian Line. She was a sister ship to MS Augustus which was launched in the same year. She was built for the South America service like her sister. These two ships' specification and design were very similar. During World War II, the Italian Line had lost a large portion of its fleet, including the ocean liner . The surviving ships were refitted and repaired, and returned to passenger service after the war was over. However, the surviving ships like and her sister ship , and the and her sister ship , all could carry small numbers of passengers. The Italian Line needed new liners for the South American service. It placed an order with Cantieri Riuniti dell' Adriatico to build two new 27,000 GRT ocean liners, to be christened Giulio Cesare and Augustus. The building of the 27,000 GRT Giulio Cesare and Augustus marked the start of a new era for the Italian Line; furthermore, other large Italian liners were being built, such as the and her sister ship , both 29,000 GRT. In 1958, these two great liners were followed by . and her sister ship which were the last and the biggest liners of the Italian Line. Design and construction MS Giulio Cesare was built by Cantieri Riuniti dell' Adriatico, Monfalcone (Yard #1756) but was engines by Societa Anonima Fiat, Turin. She was launched on May 18, 1950 in the presence of Md. Donna Ida Einaudi, wife of the President of Italy. The ship was completed in September 1951 and made her maiden voyage on October 27, 1951 from Genoa to Naples and then to Buenos Aires. The Augustus and the Giulio Cesare were powered by Societa Anonima Fiat diesel engines. These engines were the largest and most powerful ever built, and were found to cause severe vibrations in her passenger accommodation, however, they produced 35,000 HP, providing 23.3 knots, which made her popular. The exterior design of Giulio Cesare and her sister attracted many passengers because of their fat and round bows, curved superstructures, modern masts, tall large funnel, and graceful sterns. They also provided full air-conditioning for passengers. The ships were divided into three classes: First, Cabin, and Tourist. There were swimming pools for each class. The First class cabins had two or four roomed suites, one and two berth cabins, and private facilities and phones. The Cabin class were provided with a bathroom and one, two or four berth cabins. The Tourist Class accommodation lacked some of the luxuries of the other classes, but were still considered modern and comfortable . Service history She was initially placed on the Genoa-Buenos Aires service after her maiden voyage. But she was transferred to the Genoa-Cannes-Naples-New York City service on June 29, 1956 and operated this route until 1960 when she was returned to the Italy-South America route after she has made 32 round voyages on the North Atlantic route. She remained on her South America route for the next thirteen years. She was refitted in 1964. After the refit, she received a new cinema, and the Cabin and Tourist Class dining rooms were combined. Her three classes were also merged into a First and Tourist class after the refit. However the number of passengers she and her sisters were carrying began to decline. She developed problems with her rudder on January 14, 1973 and had to return to Naples. The Italian Line decided to sell her for scrap. She was laid up at Naples on January 14, and departed on April 20 for the Terrestre Marittima Shipyards, La Spezia, Italy where she was broken up, the first post-war built Italian liner to be scrapped.

Short was a well-known advocate of states' rights in the early 20th century. Frank Hamilton Short (September 12, 1862 - June 5, 1920) was a Fresno, California lawyer and a states' rights advocate within the early American Conservation movement. Soon after Short's birth in Shelby County, Missouri, his father died from drinking poisoned water while engaged in the American Civil War. Short and his mother moved to Fresno, California in 1881. After a brief stint as a school teacher in Ahwanee, California, Short was, at age 22, elected justice of the peace in Fresno County. Admitted to the bar in 1887, Short became an accomplished trial lawyer. Later, he changed his practice to represent companies in the oil, water, and natural resources industries. Short was involved in the California Bar Association, a voluntary organization that predated the mandatory State Bar of California that was established in 1927. He was president of the statewide organization in 1918. He also had been president of the Fresno County Bar Association in 1899, 1912, and 1913. In 1899, Governor Henry Gage appointed Short to the State Board of Commissioners for the preservation of Yosemite Valley. Short was an avid hiker and explorer of the Sierra Nevada. Short was nationally known for his advocacy for states' rights and the private development of natural resources. He attended several national public lands and conservation conferences and was a speaker at the National Conservation Congress held in St. Paul, Minnesota in September 1910, as were President William Taft, former President Theodore Roosevelt, and conservationist Gifford Pinchot.Proceedings of the Second National Conservation Congress at Saint Paul September 5‚Äì8, 1910, National Conservation Congress, 1911 Later, Short teamed with former California governor James N. Gillett to lobby Congress on similar issues. A lifelong Republican, Short unsuccessfully ran in 1888 for Fresno County district attorney. He was a delegate to the Republican National Conventions in St. Louis, Missouri in 1896 and in Chicago, Illinois in 1904, where he was on the sub-committee that drafted the party platform. In 1912 he actively campaigned for the re-election of President Taft in opposition to Progressive Party candidate Theodore Roosevelt. Short ran for a seat in the California State Senate in 1906, but lost by fewer than 400 votes.http://www.joincalifornia.com/election/1906-11-06 He was mentioned as a possible candidate for California governor in 1902,\\"Coast Brevities,\\" The San Francisco Call, December 4, 1901, p. 13 and as a United States Senate candidate in 1904.\\"Bard Comes to the City,\\" The San Francisco Call, July 14, 1904, p. 4 In 1911, he challenged former President Roosevelt at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco, California, again on the issue of the Western States' rights to develop federal lands.Saum, Steven Boyd, Ed., Each a Mighty Voice: A Century of Speeches from The Commonwealth Club of California, Heyday Books, Berkeley, California, 2004 pg. 5 In his argument, Short used a metaphor of Uncle Sam having four sons, East, North, South, and West. Uncle Sam transferred to his three oldest sons, East, North, and South, all their share of his estate. Then after the youngest brother began to show the real value of the left-over portion of their father's estate, the older brothers began to look with covetous eyes upon their younger brother's inheritance. Then the elder brothers complained to Uncle Sam that he should not have given them the land and to atone for his mistake, he should hold the younger brother's share for the benefit of all four of them.Selected Papers of Frank Hamilton Short Being Addresses, Civic Studies & Public Letters, Grabhorn Press, San Francisco, 1923 pg. 3 Short later published a written rebuttal to President Roosevelt's Commonwealth Club speech.Ibid., pg. 9 Short died after a long illness in San Francisco, California and was buried in Mountain View Cemetery in Fresno, California.http://www.findagrave.com/cgi- bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln;=short&GScid;=8189&GRid;=23696710& NotesReferences *Selected Papers of Frank Hamilton Short Being Addresses, Civic Studies & Public Letters, Grabhorn Press, San Francisco, 1923 Category:1862 births Category:1920 deaths Category:American conservationists Category:California lawyers Category:Activists from California ","title":"Frank Hamilton Short"},{"id":"20954784","title":"Lot of Leavin' Left to Do"},{"id":"20954785","text":"Richard Avery \\"Dick\\" Lyon (September 7, 1939 - July 8, 2019) was an American rower who competed in the 1964 Summer Olympics and in the 1972 Summer Olympics.

In O. crenuchoides, the body and face are more rounded. The last simple dorsal ray is flexible and smooth. Scale count is 23 in the lengthwise series and 7 in the transverse series. The tube-bearing scales of the lateral line are restricted to the first 6 or 7 scales anteriorly. The head is marked by numerous fine rows of pores, mostly in parallel groups on the snout, cheeks, interorbital space, and operuclar bones. Barbels are absent. Distribution Thailand, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar (Burma), northern Malay Peninsula, and the Mekong basin in Laos. Habitat Oreichthys are found in ditches, ponds, streams (both highland and lowland) and canals. Aquarium Maintenance All Oreichthys species are easily maintained in aquaria. They are generally peaceful towards conspecifics and tankmates, even where the other fish may be smaller than they are. They appear to prefer cooler water temperatures, with 76 ¬∞F appearing to be the short-term upper limit unless auxiliary aeration is provided. They will feed on flake food, micro-pellets, frozen bloodworms, frozen mysis shrimp, and gelatin diet. All in all they are not fussy feeders, and adapt readily to captivity. pH should range from neutral to slightly alkaline with moderate water hardness.

Younger Years  Anglin was born on a farm in Franklin, Tennessee to John B. and Lue (n√©e Tucker) Anglin. Jack was taught to play guitar by his father at a young age. By the time he was fourteen, Jack was singing and playing guitar on local radio stations even though he could not read music. In 1930, a young Anglin moved off the family farm to Nashville, Tennessee in hopes of perusing his dreams of becoming a musician. Jack and his brothers Van and Jim began performing as the Anglin Twins and Red. Once the trio's music was picked up by southern radio stations, the group changed names to The Anglin Brothers. The family band would later disband in 1939.  Early career  Around the time the brotherly band separated, Jack worked at a local hosiery mill and became acquainted with his future wife, Louise; and through her, her brother, Johnnie Wright. At the time Wright, his wife Murial (Kitty Wells) and Louise were regulars on WSIX-AM as Johnnie Wright and the Harmony Girls. Jack joined Wright's side performance as Johnnie Wright and the Happy Roving Cowboys now with Jack Anglin. Wright and Anglin first performed together live as a duo at a concert benefit for victims of the Louisville/ Nashville flood of 1936 under the stage name The Backwater Boys following the Harmony Girl's performance. Johnnie and Jack shared a connection much stronger than a shared birth date. Following that performance, Wright and Anglin decided to make their partnership official and formed the Johnnie and Jack music duo for which they became famous. The group was known for their combination of somber lyrics, homey harmonies, and true southern American beats. Anglin played the rhythm guitar and tenor vocals, while Wright took the lead. Anglin impressed audiences with his incorporation of the gourd as a musical instrument in some of their songs. For eleven years the duo was signed with RCA Victor records. They signed their final contract with Decca Records.  Fame  Johnnie and Jack toured locally around Tennessee until 1940 when they decided to take their show on the road. To pay for the travel, Johnnie Wright sold his carpentry tools for gas money. Ironically, two years later the group broke up due to a dispute over gas money. Jack Anglin went back to Nashville and began performing at the Grand Ole Opry as part of Roy Acuff‚Äôs Smoky Mountain Boys band. Anglin played with the band for six months before World War II broke out, and Jack decided to enlist in the United States Army. After four years in Europe, Anglin discharged as a medical orderly sergeant from the medical corps. Following his return from service, Johnnie and Jack began touring together again. In an effort to solidify their position in the southern country music world, Johnnie and Jack founded the Louisiana Hayride Barn show in 1947. The hard work paid off as the duo became permanent residents of the Grand Ole Opry in 1952. Beginning their tour with the Opry, Johnnie and Jack performed together over 3,000 times throughout five countries traveling 100,000 miles a year and writing over 100 songs. Known for their ‚Äúfast-moving and fun‚Äù routines, audiences paid seventy-five cents per person to hear the brotherly folk duet sing some of their ‚Äúlove gone wrong hits such as ‚ÄúPoison Love‚Äù, ‚ÄúCrying Heart Blues‚Äù, ‚ÄúAshes of Love‚Äù, and ‚ÄúHummingbird‚Äù.  Death  On March 8, 1963, Anglin veered off New Due West Avenue, down a ditch twelve foot deep into a tree in Madison, Tennessee. Jack Anglin's death was a blow to the country music community. Earlier that week, four other members of the Grand Ole Opry perished in a plane accident. On the morning of his death, Anglin first attended the joint services of Cowboy Copas and Randy Hughes then the memorial for Hawkshaw Hawkins before headed to the barbershop to prepare for Patsy Cline‚Äôs memorial service. It was the hair-cut that made Jack Anglin late and put him in a rush to get to Cline's service on time, causing him to speed and lose control of his vehicle. Jack Anglin died on impact of a fractured skull. Anglin was buried in Goodlettsville, Tennessee in the same cemetery as Cowboy Copas. In his 1993 memoir, By The Seat of my Pants, musician Buddy Killen claimed Jack Anglin was headed the opposite direction of the funeral and did not die in the accident. No evidence has ever been produced to support his outlandish claim. Jack left behind his young son Terry and wife Louise. Two weeks prior to his death, Jack Anglin and Johnnie Wright had released two new songs they hoped to soon take on the road. Following his death, in 1983 his family opened a museum in honor of his musical legacy on Old Hickory Boulevard. In the late twentieth century, two of Jack Anglins songs were used as soundtracks to the television shows The Marty Stuart Show and God's Bloody Acre- Kitty Wells.

President George W. Bush first proclaimed the month on April 20, 2006, as a result of cooperation with Sen. Arlen Specter (R-PA), as well as the Jewish Museum of Florida and the South Florida Jewish Community. Since then, annual proclamations have been made by Presidents Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. Purpose In April 2006, President George W. Bush announced that May 2006 would be considered Jewish American Heritage Month. The announcement was an achievement in the lobbying effort of the Jewish Museum of Florida and South Florida Jewish Community leaders for a celebration of Jewish Americans and Jewish American Heritage. The president wanted to proclaim a month that would recognize the more than 350-year history of Jewish contributions to America and the American culture. On February 14, 2006, Congress issued House Concurrent Resolution 315 which stated: \\"Resolved ... that Congress urges the President to issue each year a proclamation calling on State and local governments and the people of the United States to observe an American Jewish History Month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.\\" The concurrent resolution (i.e., a non-binding legislative measure that lacks the force of law, appropriate when a law is not necessary‚Äîsuch as awards or recognitions) was passed unanimously, first in the United States House of Representatives in December 2005 and later in the United States Senate in February 2006. The Jewish American Heritage Month Coalition states that, \\"JAHM also enables the exploration of the meaning of religious pluralism, cultural diversity, and participation in American civic culture.\\" According to Library of Congress hosted website, JewishHeritageMonth.gov, May was chosen as the month of Jewish American Heritage Month because of the successful 350th Anniversary Celebration of Jews in America marking the Jewish arrival in New Amsterdam.

The film was made to warn people about rape and popular teen actress Melissa Joan Hart was cast in the lead to draw a young audience.Review by Variety  Plot  Mary Stuartson is a college student who works as a reporter for the college newspaper. She is involved with a case, regarding possibly a few football players having hacked the computer of a professor to steal an upcoming test. Her best friend Holly is involved with one of the hackers, Billy, and one night at a party, she is raped by Clay Roberts, one of the athletes. She admits to Mary what happened, telling her that she tried to push him away and scream. She refuses to report it to the police and starts to think it was her own fault. She does go to the dean, however, but he seems to respond in Clay's favor. Holly took a test after the rape, for further proof, but she made the mistake to first take a shower. Because of this, there is no physical evidence of proof that she was raped. Holly tries to forget what happened, but Mary is determined that justice is served. She goes to the police, but they can't help her because the university system found Clay innocent. She discovers that last year, there were twenty- six reports of rapes, but only two of them resulted in charges. The mild university system frustrates Mary, and she thinks that Clay is especially treated softly because he is an important quarterback. She confronts him, but he states that Holly wanted to sleep with him and that he turned her down. She soon starts writing an article about the rape, but one of the student reports finds it and shows it to Clay. Not much later she is first attacked by a group of men wearing balaclavas. She is convinced Clay is responsible, but they all have alibis. Meanwhile, Holly starts receiving threat letters and she is almost going over the edge. Mary decides to quit the investigation, but she soon starts to feel as if she has failed. Her parents suggest her to apply for another university, offering their retirement money. Mary refuses, however, explaining she can't leave everything behind. It doesn't take long for Mary to start reporting again and from there on, the threats start coming again. This time Mary's boyfriend David is the victim, getting hard treatment from his fellow basketball players. Meanwhile, Mary angers the dean by printing an article in which she reveals that most rape reports last year didn't result in charges. As a response, her car is dumped at a nearby lake. Later, Holly announces she will drop out of college. Clay spots Billy talking to Mary and later gets mad at him. Billy confronts him with the rape, but Clay assures him he isn't guilty. Meanwhile, Mary finds the dress Holly wore on the night of the rape and brings it to the police. It is soon discovered that there are sperm samples on the dress. On the night of a big football game, Clay is arrested and Mary is able to stay in college.

He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Dungarvan in 1852. He was subsequently an MP for Cork City, serving between 1865 and his death in 1872. He wrote for his Newspaper, the Cork Examiner and wrote several books, including \\"The Irish in America\\" in 1867. He actively supported the Liberal Party's legislation on the disestablishment of the Church as well as the land question. Then in 1870, John Maguire joined the Home Rule party for Ireland. On May 1, 1872, Maguire responded to conservative MP John Henry Scourfield, in a debate over the Women's Disabilities Removal Bill, an early women's suffrage bill. Scourfield had argued that Jane Austen would be against women's suffrage, but Maguire responded that he thought she would be for it, because, were she alive, she would have allied herself with the deepest thinkers and most brilliant writers of the day, who supported it. This is believed to have been the first debate over Austen in official parliamentary business. Maguire made many contributions to political debate. His book \\"The Irish in America\\" covered such topics as their views towards slavery, the troubles they found once arriving in America, the overcrowding of immigrants within the large cities and the poverty they became accustomed to. There were other parts of this book that weren't directly related to those subjects, but that of the actual passage and perils on the seas that those travelling experienced. He was interested in explicitly educating his Irish readership, bringing attention to the reasons for committing crime, and pointing out some of the positive traits the Irish brought with them, such as a love for life, a strong sense of loyalty, and a strong work ethic. He also had a sincere concern with the drinking problem among the Irish. References * * Maguire, John Francis. The Irish in America, 4th Edition. New York: D. & J. Sadlier & Company, 1867.

Flora of North America. It is endemic to Florida in the United States, where it is distributed in the northern and central counties.Garberia heterophylla. NatureServe 2013. The plant is known commonly as garberia and Garber's scrub starts. Description This species is a shrub growing about 1 to 2.5 meters tall, with erect, branching stems. The branches are glandular and powdery or lightly hairy in texture when new, and grooved when dry. In a young plant leaves near the base of the stem may be oppositely arranged, but at maturity the branches are mostly lined with alternate leaves. The gray-green blades are glandular, and sticky to powdery when new. They are up to 3.5 centimeters long. The cylindrical flower heads are up to about half a centimeter wide and are borne in open inflorescences. Each head usually contains five aromatic pink or purple disc florets up to a centimeter long. The tips expand into five lobes and the narrow to threadlike style branches protrude. The fruit is a rough-textured, ribbed cypsela with a pappus of many bristles.Garberia heterophylla. Flora of North America. The fruits remain on the plant, and their long, brown pappi make the shrub stand out among other plants during the winter. The pappi also allow dispersal of the seeds on the wind.  Taxonomy  The genus Garberia was named by Asa Gray in honour of American botanist Abram Paschal Garber. Ecology This plant occurs in the Florida scrub and related habitat types, including flatwoods, coastal dunes, and ridges, hills and prairie alongside oaks and pines such as sand pine. It grows in dry, sandy soils low in organic matter. It may flower almost year-round, but it main flowering season is fall. Garberia provides nectar for many native bees, including Agapostemon splendens, Anthidiellum notatum, Augochlora pura, Augochlorella aurata, Augochloropsis metallica, Bombus impatiens, Coelioxys mexicana, Coelioxys sayi, Colletes mandibularis, Dialictus miniatulus, Dialictus nymphalis, Dialictus placidensis, Epeolus carolinus, Megachile mendica, Megachile pruina, Megachile xylocopoides, and Xylocopa virginica.Deyrup, M., et al. (2002). The diversity and floral hosts of bees at the Archbold Biological Station, Florida (Hymenoptera: Apoidea). Insecta Mundi 16(1‚Äì3) 87-120.  Classification  Garberia is in the tribe Eupatorieae of the aster family. Like other members of this tribe, the flower heads have disc florets and no ray florets. It is also in the subtribe Liatrinae along with, for example, Carphephorus. Garberia is closely related to the genus Liatris, but can be distinguished because it is a shrub instead of an herbaceous perennial and has a different karyotype.

Schl√∂sser), formerly written Schlo√ü, is the German term for a building similar to a ch√¢teau, palace or manor house. In the United Kingdom, it would be known as a stately home or country house. Similarly, in the Scandinavian languages (related Germanic languages), the cognate word slot/slott is normally used for what in English could be either a palace or a castle (instead of words in rarer use such as palats/pal√¶, kastell or borg). In Dutch, the word slot is considered to be more archaic; nowadays, one commonly uses paleis or kasteel. Most Schl√∂sser were built after the Middle Ages as residences for the nobility and not as true fortresses, although they were often originally fortified. The usual German term for a true castle is Burg, and for a fortress is Festung or ‚Äî slightly more archaic ‚Äî Veste. However, many castles were called Schloss, especially those that were used as residences after they lost their defensive significance, and many were adapted to new tastes during the Renaissance and Baroque periods. Like a castle, a Schloss is often surrounded by a moat and is then called a Wasserschloss (water castle). Other types include the Stadtschloss (city palace), the Jagdschloss (hunting lodge) and the Lustschloss (pleasure palace or summer residence). Examples of Schl√∂sser '''''' Sometimes, the medieval Carolingian Kaiserpfalzen are considered as Schl√∂sser already, such as the Palace of Aachen and the Imperial Palace of Goslar. ;Gothic * Schloss Albrechtsburg in Mei√üen, considered to be Germany's oldest SchlossSchloss Albrechtsburg * Schloss Allner * Schloss Blutenburg in Munich, a \\"castle\\" in English, but a Schloss in German ;Renaissance * Schloss Gl√ºcksburg * Schloss G√ºstrow * Schloss Johannisburg * Schloss Mespelbrunn * Schloss Neuburg ;Baroque * Schloss Belvedere in Vienna * Schloss Esterhazy in Eisenstadt * Schloss Hellbrunn in Salzburg * Schloss Ludwigsburg * Schloss Ludwigslust * Schloss Mirabell in Salzburg * Schloss Moritzburg * Schloss Nymphenburg in Munich * Schloss Pillnitz * Stadtschloss Potsdam * Schloss Rastatt * Schloss Sanssouci * Schloss Schlei√üheim in Oberschlei√üheim, a northern suburb of Munich * Schloss Sch√∂nbrunn in Vienna * Schloss Schwetzingen ;Neo-Baroque * Schloss Linderhof * Schloss Herrenchiemsee ;Neoclassicism * Schloss Charlottenhof * Schloss Glienicke * Schloss Weimar * Schloss Wilhelmsh√∂he * Schloss Bellevue ;Historicism * Schloss Babelsberg * Schloss Callenberg * Schloss Drachenburg * Schloss Granitz * Schloss Marienburg * Orangerieschloss Potsdam * Schloss Schwerin * Schloss Stolzenfels * Burg Hohenzollern, a \\"castle\\" both in English and German, when really a fully-flung Schloss * Schloss Ringberg in Kreuth, Bavaria ;Cross overs (Relating to places in use for long periods of times, having been extended and/or having had renovations in different styles ‚Äì of their respective eras ‚Äì and therefore displaying at least two and often more of these) * Stadtschloss Berlin * M√ºnchner Residenz * Schloss Weilburg Note In another context, Schloss is also the German word for a lock.

At each gate, continuation is decided by (typically) a manager, steering committee, or governance board. The decision is made based on forecasts and information available at the time, including the business case, risk analysis, and availability of necessary resources (e.g., money, people with correct competencies).  History  A phased approach to investment decisions for development arose in large-scale projects for mechanical and chemical engineering, particularly since the 1940s. One source described eight phases. In 1958, the American Association of Cost Engineers created four standard cost estimate type classifications to match these development and approval phases. Other industries with complex products and projects picked up on the process. For example, NASA practiced the concept of phased development in the 1960s with its phased project planning or what is often called phased review process. The phased review process was intended to break up the development of any project into a series of phases that could be individually reviewed in sequence. Review points at the end of each phase required that a number of criteria be met before the project could progress to the next phase. The phased review process consisted of five phases with periodic development reviews between phases. NASA's phased review process is considered a first generation process because it did not take into consideration the analysis of external markets in new product development. A variation of the phase-gate process, known as the stage-gate process, arose from the work of Robert G. Cooper. The waterfall process variant arose through publication of Winston Royce's paper on large developments, as it illustrated work cascading down from each phase as a series of waterfalls from which work could not return to an earlier phase. Phase-gate processes are often called front-end loading or big design up front.  Phases  The traditional phase- gate process has five phases with four gates. The phases are: # Scoping # Build business case # Development # Testing and validation # Launch Ahead of this process there is often a preliminary phase called ideation or discovery, and after the fifth phase the process typically ends with the post-launch review. Major new products go through the full five-phase process. Moderate risk projects (such as extensions and enhancements) often use a reduced 3-phase version, which combines the scoping with the business case phase, and developing with the testing phase. Very simple changes (such as a marketing request) may be executed using a light two-phase process, where the launch is rolled into development and testing too.  Gates  Gates provide a point during the process where an assessment of the quality of an idea is undertaken. It includes three main issues: * Quality of execution: Checks whether the previous step is executed in a quality fashion. * Business rationale: Does the project continue to look like an attractive idea from an economic and business perspective. * Action plan: The proposed action plan and the requested resources reasonable and sound. A gate can lead to one of five possible results: go, kill, hold, recycle, or conditional go. Gates have a common structure and consist of three main elements: * Inputs: What the project manager and team deliver to the decision point. These deliverables are decided at the output of the previous gate, and are based on a standard menu of deliverables for each gate. * Criteria: Questions or metrics on which the project is judged in order to determine a result (go/kill/hold/recycle) and make a prioritization decision. * Outputs: Results of the gate review‚Äîa decision (go/kill/hold/recycle), along with an approved action plan for the next gate, and a list of deliverables and date for the next gate. Phases in detail This section on the phases or stages of this phase-gate or stage-gate process is taken from the 5th edition of R.G. Cooper's Winning at New Products: Creating Value Through Innovation, as well as from earlier editions. = Phase 0: discovery or ideation = Deciding what projects the company desires and is capable to pursue. During this phase it is common for companies to take part in idea generation activities such as brainstorming or other group thinking exercises. Once the idea generation team has selected a project that they would like to go forward with, it must be passed on to the first gate and therefore screened by the organization's decision makers. When searching for new product ideas it is beneficial for an organization to look to the outside world to suggest business opportunities. Using methods such as those found in empathic design can be quite helpful. Communicating with customers to understand how and why they use products can produce great strides in idea generation. Specifically, communicating with lead users can provide great feedback to the developers, as these customers are most likely to feel most passionately about the product. In addition to communication with lead users, it may be helpful for developers to communicate with suppliers. By understanding all of the types of business that their materials are being used for, developers may be able to act upon previously untapped possibilities. = Phase 1:Scoping = The first phase of the product development process is scoping. During this step the main goal is to evaluate the product and its corresponding market. The researchers must recognize the strengths and weaknesses of the product and what it is going to offer to the potential consumer. The competition must also be evaluated during this phase. It is important for the researchers to understand who and what is already in the market as well as what can potentially be developed. By determining the relative level of threat from competitors, the management team will be able to recognize whether or not they should go forward with the production of the product. = Phase 2: building the business case and plan = Once the new product passes through the gate at the end of the scoping phase, the next phase in the phase-gate process is building the business case and plan. This is the last phase of concept development where it is crucial for companies to perform a solid analysis before they begin developing the product. This phase is generally difficult, complex, and resource-intensive. However, companies must put forth a strong effort in this phase for it is directly related to the success and development of a new product. There are four main steps that comprise this phase: product definition and analysis, building the business case, building the project plan, and feasibility review.  Product definition and analysis  The first step, product definition and analysis, is composed of a series of activities that will provide the information to define and justify the development of a new product. One of the first of these activities is the user needs and wants study where customer value is determined. This addresses questions about the product such as what benefits does the product provide and what features should the product have. During this time the company should conduct surveys and interviews with existing and potential customers, along with staff members. Next, the company must conduct a market analysis. They must determine the market size and segmentation, rate of growth, customer trends and behavior, and what channels reach these customers. Once the market analysis is complete the company must then conduct a competitive analysis. It is important to know how your competitors operate in addition to their strengths and weaknesses. This will not only help you build a great product, but will also help in determining how and where to launch your new product. Together these activities will help define the product and provide a foundation for the marketing strategy. Next, the company must build a technically feasible product concept, which includes the substance and methods needed to produce the new product. Once this is completed the company can then produce a production and operations cost analysis along with a market and launch costs analysis. Next, the company can begin to test the concept they have developed. This is when early prototypes are developed and presented to staff and consumers to gain feedback and gauge customer reaction. From this the company can make the necessary changes and see the sales potential of the product. This feedback will also help the company build a solid product definition. Lastly, the company will then conduct the business analysis, risk analysis, and financial analysis of the new product.  Building the business case  The business case is a document that defines the product and provides the rationale for developing it. This document will vary in format amongst companies, but the primary components are the following: results of the activities of product definition and analysis; legal and regulatory requirements; safety, health, and environmental considerations; assumptions needed to draw the conclusions made, and why it is believed they are valid and reasonable; and out-of-bounds criteria that indicate certain changes/events which will mandate an emergency business case review. This document will be referred to throughout the development process and edited when necessary.  Building the project plan  The project plan includes: a scheduled list of tasks and events along with timelines for milestones throughout the development process; the personnel, time, and financial resources needed to complete the project; and an expected launch date for the release of the new product.  Feasibility review  The last step of building the business case and plan is the feasibility review. This is when management, along with other departments of the company, reviews the rationale for pursuing the product. They analyze the information provided by the previous steps in this process to decide whether or not the product should move forward. If it is decided to be pursued then it passes through gate two and moves on to the product development phase. = Phase 3: development = During the development phase, plans from previous steps are actually executed. The product's design and development is carried out, including some early, simple tests of the product and perhaps some early customer testing. The product's marketing and production plans are also developed. It is important that the company adheres to their overall goal of the project, which is reflected in these production and marketing plans. Doing this will allow them to definitively decide who they will market their product to and how they will get the product to that target audience. The development team maps out a realistic timeline with specific milestones that are described as SMART: specific, measurable, actionable, realistic, and time-bound. The timeline is frequently reviewed and updated, helping the team stay on task and giving management information about the product's progress. In the development phase, the product builds momentum as the company commits more resources to the project and makes full use of cross-functional teamwork as the marketing, technical, manufacturing, and sales departments all come together to offer their expert opinions. Having a diversified and parallel development phase ensures that the product continues to meet the company's technical and financial goals. A diverse team allows specific roles and leadership positions to develop as team members make contributions using their strongest attributes. With members having clearly defined roles, tasks can be performed concurrently ensuring a much more efficient development process. The ultimate deliverable of the development phase is the prototype, which will undergo extensive testing and evaluation in the next phase of the process. = Phase 4: testing and validation = This phase provides validation for the entire project. Areas that will be evaluated include: the product itself, the production/manufacturing process, customer acceptance, and the financial merit of the project. This phase includes three types of testing: near testing, field testing, and market testing.  Near testing  The main objective of near testing is to find any bugs or issues with a product. A key point to remember here, highlighted by Stephan Lowry (Author of 'The Stoner Bible'), is that the product is no longer a prototype and that it has almost all the features of the commercial product. Testing will be done initially by in-house staff, and customers and partners who are close to the firm. It is important to ensure that those testing have an understanding of how the product should perform, so they know what it should or shouldn't be doing. Members of the research and development team are usually present to observe the participants using the product and take any notes or data that may be useful.  Field testing  Field testing, or beta testing, is done by those who can provide valuable feedback on the product. This usually lasts a long period of time and the participants can include customers, partners, or anyone who is not familiar with the producing company. At this juncture the product fully resembles its planned launch version in all aspects; therefore the participants' interaction rate will be higher because they know all the features and benefits. During this phase there are three primary objectives to be achieved. The first objective is to see how much the participant is interested. It is also worthwhile to note which individual attribute they prefer and if they would buy the product. Next, determine how the customer uses the product and evaluate its durability. Confirm the environment in which the customers will be using the product. Recording and analyzing customer feedback is the final step in the field testing phase. This feedback may be used to help inform any minor design improvements that need to be made. The sales and marketing team will also be a beneficiary of field testing feedback; they can use this information to help focus their sales presentation.  Market testing  Unlike the other two test activities, market testing is considered optional. A solid marketing and launch plan along with confidence in the product's ability to sell helps to inform the key decision makers at the test and validation gate. If there is any uncertainty in the marketing or launch plans there are two options to consider. First, a simulated market test may be run, in which customers will be exposed to new products in an advertising and purchasing situation. The goal of this test is to obtain an early forecast of sales and make any necessary adjustments to the marketing plan. The second test involves trial sales, and is done through specific channels, regions, or consumer demographics. = Phase 5: product launch = The product launch is the culmination of the product having passed all previous gates. The producer must come up with a marketing strategy to generate customer demand for the product. The producer must also decide how large they anticipate the market for a new product to be and thus determine the size of their starting volume production. Part of the launch phase is training sales and support personnel to be familiar with the product so that they can assist in sales of this product. Setting a product price is an aspect of the product launch that the producer must consider. They should avoid either undershooting or overpricing the potential market. Finally, distribution is a major decision making part of the launch process. Selecting a distributor or value-added reseller for a product must be done with careful thought and potential sales in mind. Having a smooth launch process that includes effective marketing and a knowledgeable and prepared sales force may result in faster time to profit due to early customer acceptance.  Effective gates  Most firms suffer from having far too many projects in their product development pipelines, for the limited resources available. \\"Gates with teeth\\" help to prune the development portfolio of weak projects and deal with a gridlocked pipeline. Also, a robust innovation strategy, coupled with strategic buckets, refocuses resources on high value development initiatives. Note that gates are not merely project review points, status reports or information updates. Rather, they are tough decision meetings, where the critical go/kill and prioritization decisions are made on projects. Thus the gates become the quality control check points in the process ensuring that you do the right projects and also do the projects right. Gates must have clear and visible criteria so that senior managers can make go/kill and prioritization decisions objectively. Most importantly, these criteria must be effective‚Äîthat is, they must be operational (easy to use), realistic (make use of available information) and discriminating (differentiate the good projects from the mediocre ones). These criteria can be: * Must meet: Knock-out questions in a check list, designed to kill poor projects outright * Should meet: Highly desirable characteristics which are rated and added in a point- count scheme A sample list of criteria is shown below, from which a scorecard can be developed that can then be used to score projects at a gate meeting. * Must meet (checklist - yes/no) ** Strategic alignment (fits business unit strategy) ** Reasonable likelihood of technical feasibility ** Meet EH&S; policies ** Positive return versus risk * Should meet (scored on 0-10 scale) ** Strategic *** Degree to which projects aligns with business unit strategy *** Strategic importance ** Product advantage *** Unique benefits *** Meets customer needs better than existing or competing product *** Value for money ** Market attractiveness *** Market size *** Market growth *** Competitive situation ** Synergies (leverages core competencies) *** Marketing synergies *** Technological synergies *** Manufacturing / processing synergies ** Technical feasibility *** Technical gap *** Complexity *** Technical uncertainty ** Operational viability *** Go to market *** Sales, marketing, and billing *** Support and operation ** Risk versus return *** Expected profitability (e.g., net present value) *** Return (e.g., internal rate of return) *** Payback period *** Certainty of return If the answers are \\"no\\" or \\"low\\" to many of these questions, the decision should be to send the project back for reconsideration, (such as, to adjust the scope, timelines, funding, or solution) or to kill it off altogether.  Advantages and disadvantages  There are a number of advantages to using the phase-gate process for product development, which typically result from its ability to identify problems and assess progress before the project's conclusion. Poor projects can be quickly rejected by disciplined use of the process. When using the phase-gate process on a large project, the process can help reduce complexity of what could be a large and limiting innovation process into a straightforward rule-based approach. When a phase-gate process incorporates cost and fiscal analysis tools such as net present value, the organization can potentially be provided with quantitative information regarding the feasibility of developing potential product ideas. Finally, the process is an opportunity to validate the updated business case by a project's executive sponsors. One problem with the phase-gate process is the potential for structural organization to interfere with creativity and innovation, as overly structured processes may cause creativity to be reduced in importance and to hinder the largely iterative process of innovation.  Opportunity management  The opportunity management funnel is a visual representation of phase-gate decision making. Opportunity management has been defined as \\"a process to identify business and community development opportunities that could be implemented to sustain or improve a local economy.\\" The components of opportunity management are: # Identifying opportunities. # Evaluating and prioritizing these opportunities - This may involve developing criteria, deliberating, and ranking the alternatives. # Driving opportunities - Involves assigning leads, accountability, action plans, and project management # Constant monitoring - May require one of the following actions: #* Advance - Commit additional resources to move the idea forward #* Rework - More investigation/ rethinking #* Kill - Stop working on the idea and move on The goal of the opportunity management funnel is to eliminate weak or bad ideas before money or resources are contributed to realize these opportunities. The benefit of the opportunity management funnel when utilizing phase-gate decision making is that the funnel generates efficiencies where weak ideas are efficiently eliminated leaving a strong set of viable alternatives. To fulfill its mandate, the opportunity management funnel filters the broadest range of opportunities and ensures that all priority sectors are represented. When selecting which opportunities to filter through the process, economic developers should be aware that initially, there are no bad ideas or limits. The unviable alternatives will be filtered out throughout the process using phase-gate decision making process  References  Category:Project management techniques Category:Software development process ","title":"Phase-gate process"},{"id":"20955237","text":"VR Ghetge was an Indian cricketer who played for Holkar.

Randy Krbechek Track listingSingles * Did You Tell Him * Please Heart You're Killing Me Sophie Sophie, the tenth track on Snapshots, has come to prominence as an anthem for those suffering from eating disorders. The song tells the story of a young girl, Sophie, who suffers from anorexia. Sophie has been used as the soundtrack for dozens of videos across the internet with almost a million combined viewings on YouTube. The videos range from Sims animations, to personal narratives, to photographs showing the effects of eating disorders. The videos have engendered copious comments and have created a forum for people around the world to discuss all aspects of eating disorders. The phenomenon of Sophie has begun to draw media attention. Since December 2008, McEvoy has discussed the song on the BBC Radio show Woman's Hour, has been featured in an article entitled Web Hit Touches a Chord with Anorexics in the Sunday Observer, has appeared on BBC Breakfast, and has been featured on RT√â News. Most recently McEvoy was the subject of an article in the Sunday Tribune entitled McEvoy's plea to buy back hit YouTube 'anorexia' song.

It is located on the street Portal de Escribanos, block 3 of Jir√≥n de la Uni√≥n, and in front of the Plaza Mayor of Lima's historic centre. History The Municipal Palace of Lima as seen from the Plaza of the Flag =Viceroyalty= According to the first book of the Cabildo de Lima, the city had two mayors on the fourth day of its foundation: Nicol√°s de Ribera and Juan Tello de Guzm√°n. At first the council worked at the House of Pizarro and then moved to the residence of the Judges Andr√©s de Cianca and Pedro Maldonado, then the local municipality, before settling in the last weeks of October 1535 on land owned by the supplier Garc√≠a de Salcedo, where the Archbishop's Palace of Lima currently stands. However, because more space was needed for the Cathedral of Lima, the council moved in 1548 to land owned by Hernando Pizarro, the huaca of the chapter that had a pen of llamas, and this is where the current municipal building is located. The colonial town hall building was simple and the story of its construction has been bumpy. The master Diego de Torres was asked to build the first building of the Cabildo de Lima and in 1549 began the work quickly, with two black slaves acquired especially to strengthen his work, because I had finished before the arrival of Antonio de Mendoza, fourth viceroy of Peru, which was scheduled for September 23, 1551. The council houses built by master Diego de Torres were made with brick mold and high wood to Spain. Soon after, in 1555, Crist√≥bal Garz√≥n and Diego de Amaro took charge of the new building. During the following years some minor fixes continued such as woodwork and blanket. Jos√© de la Riva Ag√ºero then stated that the building had collapsed due to its faulty construction. The council members were present, from the old town hall colonial balconies, processions, bullfights and auto-da-f√©. The history of the Limean Inquisition recalls the auto-da-f√© held on Sunday, April 5, 1592, for which the council built a wooden platform. By 1628, the historian and priest Bernab√© Cobo described in his History of the Founding of Lima the Lima cabildo's appearance and said: The council building was characterized, between 1596 - 1604 (period of government Viceroy Luis de Velasco y Castilla) by its open gallery on the second floor, on the portals of scribes. According to Manuel de Odriozola, the R√≠mac River Bridge collapsed on the night of February 11, 1696, causing a flood in the Plaza Mayor and the protocols they had them on the floor, not on shelves so scarce and expensive it was the wood rotted enforcement tools and foundations of chaplaincies and primogeniture, whose replacement was difficult and costly. But the greatest damage suffered by the colonial cabildo caused the 1746 Lima- Callao earthquake, which destroyed 90% of the civil colonial buildings.

Gateway served as a place to classify and sort freight cars as well as an interchange with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the New York Central Railroad. Most of the cars that entered the yard were destined for Youngstown's steel mills. History The yard itself was built on over of land and stretched for more than covering the distance from the Center Street Bridge to Lowellville, Ohio. The yard included a classification yard, office complex, diesel locomotive servicing facilities, and car repair facilities. The yard tower and yard office are housed in the same building. It is rather large and resembles an aircraft control tower. Running in front of the tower is the yard's hump that is used in the sorting freight cars.

Grob-Prandl was born in Vienna and studied at the conservatory there. She originally intended to become a piano teacher but the professors at the conservatory began to notice the size of her voice and she was placed in a singing class. Besides size, her voice had a distinctive burnished timbre and a tight, brisk, consistent vibrato. She made her debut in 1939 at the Vienna Volksoper as Santuzza in Cavalleria rusticana. She graduated to heavier roles such as Isolde, Br√ºnnhilde and Turandot. She retired in 1972. Irmgard Seefried once remarked that the \\"walls shook\\" when Grob-Prandl sang Turandot. A popular anecdote states that she was once interrupted while performing as Turandot, by fire-fighters. People outside the theater had mistaken her for a fire-alarm siren. Unlike many big Wagnerians, she was dexterous enough to sing Mozart. She was a supportive, unselfish ensemble-singer. Available recordings include Donna Anna in Don Giovanni, Isabelle in Robert le Diable, Br√ºnnhilde, Isolde, First Lady in The Magic Flute, as well as Elektra, Turandot, and Elettra in Idomeneo. There is also an anthology of her solo work. She died on 16 May 1995 in the city of her birth.

He is sometimes referred to as \\"Baron of Ballsbridge\\" because of his ambitious development project for the Jury's/Berkeley Court hotels site in Ballsbridge. He left Dublin for the United States after the property collapse of 2007 to 2011. He was born in County Carlow, Ireland. In an interview with U.S. paper The International Herald Tribune in January 2009, Se√°n Dunne commented \\"if the banking crisis continues I could be considered insolvent.\\" Early career In 1990, Dunne was involved with the development of lands at St Helens in Booterstown, Dublin through Berland Homes company, of which he was managing director. St Helens was the former headquarters for the Christian Brothers in Ireland. The main house is now a Radisson hotel. Prices for the homes at the time were priced at between ¬£90,000 for a two-bedroom bungalow and ¬£250,000 for a five bedroom home with conservatory. After higher stamp duty rates were introduced in September 1990, Berland was forced to reduce the price of houses by up to 10% in order to increase sales. In 1994, Dunne along with fellow Berland directors, David Shubotham, James Burke and Frank Belton sought to build 200 apartments in the grounds of St Helens. Rebecca Jeffares of St Helen's House Preservation Group had previously prevented an office development at the site in 1992. Planning permission for the 200 apartment development was ultimately refused by An Bord Pleanala. In March 1995, Dunne had a dispute with the fellow directors of Berland. Claims of oppression were made in a petition by Dunne, then of Torquay Road, Foxrock, and two investment companies, Sainda Limited and Ronaldsay Limited against Berland, Mulroy Securities, Whitebeam Limited, Paul Coulson and David Shubotham. Later in 1995, Dunne put houses for sale for up to ¬£369,000 at his 18-acre site off Ballybride Road, Rathmichael. The development was for 18 homes. By March 1996, six of the homes built by Dunne had been sold. Other sites were sold to other builders. By 1997, Dunne was involved with another 400-unit development in the grounds of St Raphael's hospital in Lucan, Dublin. In May 1997 Dunne bought Woodtown Manor and 150 acres in Rathfarnham, Dublin from Guinness heir Garech Browne for around ¬£1.4m. Later the same year, Dunne put Grattan House, Grand Canal Street, Dublin up for sale. The asking price was ¬£6.5 million, with the property leased at the time by the Office of Public Works for ¬£547,500 per year. Dunne had bought the property in December 1996 for ¬£5m. In late 1997, Dunne was involved with the Anna Livia Consortium, which hoped to win the competition to build a national conference centre at Grand Canal Dock. The Convention Centre Dublin was ultimately developed by Treasury Holdings at Spencer Dock. The same year, Dunne through Mountbrook Homes and Sean Mulryan through Ballymore properties, bought a 100-acre site south of Greystones, County Wicklow. In 2002 they received planning permission for 1,340 homes, pushing the value of the land to an estimated ¬£140m. They also owned a neighbouring 100-acre site which was earmarked for commercial development. By 1999, Dunne had expanded into the UK. His building firm, Mountbrook Homes, bought the freehold of a 30,615sq ft office building at Walton-on-Thames, Surrey for ¬£9.3 million. Ballsbridge purchase Dunne is sometimes referred to as \\"Lord Ballsbridge\\" or \\"Baron of Ballsbridge\\" because of his ambitious development project in Ballsbridge, Dublin. Dunne was accused of recklessness for spending ‚Ç¨379m on a property deal in the prosperous Dublin 4 section of Dublin in 2005, an amount unprecedented by historical Irish standards at the time of the deal. The purchase was funded by Icelandic bank Kaupthing and Ulster Bank. Kaupthing lent Dunne ¬£84.1m through DCD Builders, according to documents leaked to WikiLeaks in 2009. Ulster Bank lent the developer ‚Ç¨326.5m for the site. Ulster Bank is not involved with the National Asset Management Agency. Kaupthing valued the sites at ‚Ç¨520m according to the documents ‚Äì Sean Dunne also personally guaranteed ‚Ç¨250m. Dunne's plans to build Ireland's tallest building, a Dubai-style office tower in the shape of a diamond with a one-billion euro price tag created a political tug-of-war in Irish society between those who saw it as a blot on the traditional Irish architectural landscape, represented by 37 separate political groups, and those who saw it as a welcome sign of modernity, represented by 90 groups who have filed appeals on Dunne's behalf. Although Dunne's high rise development was approved by the planning authority, An Bord Plean√°la, the decision was appealed and rejected on 30 January 2009. In September 2011, An Bord Plean√°la approved a heavily modified planning application for the Ballsbridge sites. The permission granted included the demolition of the old hotels, operating as D4Hotels, and the construction of 490 apartments. A hotel and healthcare facility were also planned. The 27,000 sq m of retail space proposed in the original ‚Ç¨50m and Dunne has said that any works to redevelop the site would not commence until at least 2017.  Connecticut property  As of November 2010, Se√°n Dunne faced difficulties regarding a multi-million dollar property in an exclusive estate in Greenwich, Connecticut. US officials ordered work on the property to cease as the owners have exceeded the scope of their planning permission. Sean Dunne publicly denies any claim to the property in question. In July 2011, the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) appointed receivers to some properties controlled by Dunne. One of the properties included in the receivership is Hume House in Ballsbridge, which he bought in 2006 for ‚Ç¨130 million. As of March 2012, Dunne faced the prospect of bankruptcy after he agreed to court orders directing him to repay more than ‚Ç¨185 million to the National Asset Management Agency. In 2013, Dunne filed for Chapter seven bankruptcy in the state of Connecticut in the United States where he has been resident since the failure of his development in Ballsbridge. Dunne lodged the action on Friday, 29 March 2013; he estimated his assets at between EUR 777 786 and EUR 7.77 million EUR, whilst his liabilities exceed EUR 390 million. His creditors could thus receive as little as two percent of what he owes them. Dunne commented, \\"I can always say to anyone that we did our best and came up short but now we move on\\". Political donations In 1998, Dunne emerged as the single biggest donor to Fianna F√°il for 1997. Two cheques, totaling ¬£80,250 were declared to the Public Offices Commission. The donations were made between May and December 1997 by Dunne's DCD Builders, just after Fianna F√°il were elected into power in the 1997 General Election. ¬£10,000 of the donation had indirectly come from estate agent Fintan Gunne. In 1999, two additional donations were made by DCD builders, one for ¬£5,080 and another for ¬£1,270. In 2000, Dunne declared a ¬£500 donation to Fianna F√°il after a golf classic. Personal life In 2004, Dunne married Sunday Independent gossip columnist Gayle Killilea, whom he met at the Galway Races in 2002. The marriage was noted for both its attendees and its expense, believed to be in the region of ‚Ç¨1.5 million. The wedding took place on board the Christina O, the yacht once owned by Aristotle Onassis. Attendees were reported to include Karen Millen, Michael Colgan, Michael Fingleton, Ronan O'Gara, John Mara, Claire Murphy, Paul and Mick Mehigan. During the wedding speeches, then Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy called the yacht, along with then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern. It was reported Ahern said: \\"Dunner, you and I go back a long way... I'm sorry I couldn't come but I would have been more trouble to you than I'd be worth.\\" His adult son John Dunne is the director of Yesreb, an organization also associated Sean Dunne. According to documents leaked to WikiLeaks from Icelandic Bank Kaupthing, Dunne paid $2.75m with a loan from Kaupthing, for a 1/16th stake in a Gulfstream Jet, as part of the Netjets fractional ownership scheme. This was done via an Isle of Man company called Zaskari Ltd.

He had twelve siblings, being number thirteen and the last child born in the family.Family Search Huntington's ancestors were interested in the lumber trade. His father owned a sawmill and a shingle mill. What he learned in his youth was reflected in his innovations and patents later. Huntington at the age of twenty-one went to San Francisco.HFA, Huntington genealogy, p. 54 In 1858 he took charge of a lumber mill in Monterey County, California. He later managed a shingle mill in nearby San Mateo County. While there the inadequacy of the sawmill machinery gave him ideas for improvements to shingle machines. He later obtained patents for his innovations in improvements to sawmill machinery. Sometime in the early part of the 1860s Huntington went to Humboldt County, Nevada and tried mining for a while. He had varying degrees of success. Later he went to Arizona. After years of adventure in Arizona and other places and not succeeding as well as he wished, he gave up mining and returned to San Francisco. Here he commenced to make good use of his inventive skills and in 1865 began to manufacture sawmill machinery. He introduced a number of improvements to sawmill machinery which he patented. When he moved back to San Francisco he first was located in the Pacific Saw Company's Building in San Francisco where he remained three or four years until 1870. He shows up in the 1870 San Francisco census. From time to time he moved his headquarters of mining machinery to the Kittredge Building and to the Vulcan Iron Works in San Francisco. He is then found at 45 Fremont Street and later at 213 to 219 First Street in San Francisco.According to AncestoryLibrary.com based on San Francisco Directories, 1889-91, W.H.L. Corran, 1889 and Painter and Co. Publishing, 1890. On September 18, 1873, Huntington married Laura Caroline Folzer. They had one child, a daughter named Marie Louise. They lived at Webster and Durant streets in Oakland. Huntington was a family man and spent his leisure time with his wife and daughter at their elegant home. From time to time he had Chinese servants at his home.Per 1910 and 1920 U.S. Census Self-propelled vehicle Huntington vehicle 1889 In 1889 Huntington patented a gasoline engine propelled vehicle, four years before the Duryea brothers built and tested their first vehicle in Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1893 ‚Äî considered by many as the first American gas powered car.

The attraction opened in the Marvel Super Hero Island of the theme park in 2000, a year after the opening of the park. The premise of the attraction is that Magneto, the archenemy of the X-Men, is threatening the world and Storm and Professor Xavier recruit riders into the \\"Storm Force Accelatron\\", a device that they hope will stop Magneto. History In 1991, planning began for a new theme park adjacent to Universal Studios Florida. By the end of 1993, it was decided that one area of the future Islands of Adventure theme park would be themed after Marvel Comics, with a Hulk theme being selected for a thrill ride. The designers of the ride wanted to simulate being fired out of a cannon and subsequently set about prototyping a launch system. Universal Creative and MTS Systems Corporation had a working prototype in January 1995. Methods to achieve this acceleration were investigated into mid-1996. On-site construction of Islands of Adventure was underway in 1997, with Superior Rigging & Erection being responsible for erecting the supports and track of the roller coaster. On May 28, 1999, Islands of Adventure officially opened to the public The ride was originally planned to open the ride with Islands of Adventure, but could not due to timing conflicts. The attraction broke ground in October, 1999 and construction began in February, 2000. During the construction period, walls were placed around the future attraction displaying a logo of the ride with a projected opening date of Spring, 2000. The attraction finally opened on May 28, 2000. ExperienceQueue= The queue line explains through live- action comic panels that Magneto, a villain of the X-Men, has returned to threaten the world. Storm gives word to Professor Xavier who decides to launch riders on his \\"Storm Force Accelatron\\" while Storm gathers the powers of Mother Nature in an effort to stop Magneto. =Ride experience= Riders enter circular shaped cars which are colored either purple or yellow. Each car has a large wheel in the center of it which riders may use to turn or hold onto during the course of the ride. Once riders have been seated, Professor Xavier and Storm explain the crisis going on, and give guests the instructions on how to use their accelatrons; by turning the vehicle around as fast as possible in an effort to stop Magneto. The ride then begins as riders are spun around in circles on a spinning track multiple times while they spin the vehicle even more by turning the wheel in front of them. Sound effects simulating lightning and thunder as well as flashing lights serve as show elements during the ride which originate from an overhead \\"power generator\\" facing the center of the track. At the conclusion, Xavier informs riders that they are successful and Magneto is retreating. Riders then exit the vehicles.

Although she is known best for her singing, Strydom has also been active as a playwright and actress, most notably in the fields of cabaret and also in television.  Biography  Early life = Strydom was born in the city of Port Elizabeth where she lived and went to school, matriculating from Framesby High School in 1974. She had no formal music training during her childhood (nor did she at any other time in her life) and she can't read a note of music, but she was an active participant in school choirs, and also learnt drama at the Children's Theatre with Mari Mocke and Marlene Pieterse. Strydom pursued a tertiary education at the University of Pretoria where she graduated in 1978 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, specialising in drama. = Early career = In 1979, she wrote her first song Ek loop die Pad (I walk the Road) after being urged to do so by friends. The song quickly found its audience and has remained popular ever since, even being covered by artists like Laurika Rauch. Strydom has since written most of the songs in her repertoire and discography, but she also sings songs by artists such as Koos du Plessis, Stef Bos, Jos√© Feliciano, Kris Kristofferson, Holly Cole, and George Gershwin. When writing her own songs Strydom usually composes the lyrics alone, while often collaborating with others when composing the music. Among her musical collaborators are Janine Neethling, Didi Kriel, Lize Beekman, Peter McLea, Siegfried Pretsch and Angerie van Wyk. Also in 1979, Strydom began working for the Cape Provincial Arts Board (Capab) where she starred in theatre pieces such as Die Wonderwerk (The Miracle) and \\"Kinkels innie kabel\\" (Hitches in the Cable). In the same year she also began freelancing as an actress, cabaret singer, disc jockey, television presenter and writer, this all after winning the lead role motion picture by Franz Marx, called Pasgetroud (Just Married). In 1980 she was engaged as a singer for the television programme Musiek en Liriek, together with a large group of her colleagues in the Afrikaans music industry. This programme would turn out to have a lasting impact on the development of Afrikaans popular music being, in the words of Jannie du Toit, a kind of \\"belated folk revolution\\". Strydom also began working as a disc jockey in that year, for both Highveld Stereo and Radio 5. She also landed the female lead role in Potato Eaters, an English television drama. Johannesburg's famous Market Theatre was the venue for her first performance in one of Hennie Aucamp's cabarets, Met Permissie Ges√™ (Said With Permission). This was in 1981. She also presented the character Grace Lipschitz in Hell is for Whites Only, which was written by Pieter-Dirk Uys. She also performed in Siener in die Suburbs for the official opening of the State Theatre in Pretoria. The following year saw her singing on tour with David Kramer. Well established in various industries by 1983, Strydom starred in various plays and television series in the following years. She also released her first Afrikaans LP in 1983, titled Vir my Familie (For my Family), as well as her first English LP in 1985, titled Jupiter Jones is Amanda. One of the roles she created for television was that of a Polish singer called Elzbieta Karski, for John Cundill's English television series 1922. For her performance she won the Star Tonight award for best English actress in 1985. She also began performing as a solo cabaret artist, at Garbo's in Cape Town and at Club 58 in Hillbrow. The writer Hennie Aucamp had an enormous influence on Strydom's development as a cabaret singer, and she still acknowledges him as her mentor. Merwede van der Merwe was another teacher. With the help of these men she sang in such social commentaries as Die Lewe is 'n Grenshotel (Life is a Hotel on the Border), a work whose title alludes to the South African Border War in Angola. This time in Strydom's career proved instrumental in shaping her own voice as one of dissent from the over-riding moral and political opinions of Afrikaners of that time. In her own words: \\"Daar was 'n oorlog in Angola, en ons het daaroor gesing, gespot, gepraat; nie net daaroor nie, oor sensuur, oor die liefde. Ons is in ons stockings en sykouse en fishnets en shorts. In Afrikaans het ons oor daai verhoog gespring en oor dit wat dekadent en die lewe is 'n pad begin baan vir wat mense vandag in die land kabaret noem\\". (There was a war in Angola, and we sang about it, mocked it, and talked about it; not only about that, but about censorship, and love. We were in our stockings and fishnets and shorts. In Afrikaans we jumped on that stage and laid the foundation for what people today call cabaret in this country.) However, her disillusionment with cabaret followed later when television directors and producers were asking her and others to sing translated American songs from musicals like Ebb and Kander's Cabaret. Singing these American songs in forced translation irritated Strydom so much that she decided to go her own way as a solo performer again, so that she could once again sing songs in their intended vernacular. = The Amandla! incident = Strydom achieved notoriety in 1986 for giving the black power salute after one of her songs in her cabaret at the Oude Libertas Hall in Stellenbosch. This salute was intimately associated with the black struggle and is still used as a call by black political leaders to this day. (The speaker would shout Amandla! raising his right fist in the air, to which an informed or sympathetic crowd would respond Ngawethu!) At the height of P.W. Botha's presidency it would have been taboo for any white Afrikaans woman to use this salute on stage in front of a white-only audience. Consequently, Amanda Strydom was soon referred to as Amandla Strydom in popular culture. Strydom uses the black salute on stage to this day and even occasionally refers to herself as Amandla. Shortly after this scandal Strydom was facing her own private struggle with bipolar depression, something she has written about honestly in her play In Full Light, and in the song Strydom/Amandla. She worked very little between 1988 and 1990. It is worthwhile to note that Strydom's depression coincided with a very traumatic time in the history of her country, and also that she returned to public life at the same time that apartheid was being dismantled. In 1991 she worked again, performing the cabaret Midnite Ladies at the venue After Dark in Pretoria, and she also acted on television in the Afrikaans series Arende and in the English series Big Time. Then, in the next year, she worked as a television presenter for NNTV, which was then still a subsidiary of the SABC. = State of the Heart and beyond = Strydom's career took a new path in 1993 when she staged a one- woman show which she had written by herself at the Klein Karoo Nasionale Kunstefees/KKNK (The Little Karoo National Arts Festival). The show was called State of the Heart. It became a regular performance piece in her repertoire, and it won her a Dalro Award and an Evening Post Award. She also released a CD of the cabaret's songs, called Songs from State of the Heart. The Incredible Journey of Tinkerbell van Tonder was her next one-woman-show, which she performed at the State Theatre in Pretoria, at the Grahamstown Festival, and at the Opera House in her hometown, Port Elizabeth. She has released a CD under the same title, with songs recorded from the cabaret. Strydom's third one-woman show was conceived at a time when theatres, companies and orchestras across South Africa were losing their funding from the state, money that the government planned to use on necessary social redevelopment rather than on the arts. Diva was Strydom's take on this issue, a work in which she pleaded for the integrity and worth of the arts in South Africa. In 1995 she toured the country with this production, performing it at the KKNK, at the State Theatre in Pretoria, at the Opera House in Port Elizabeth, and the Andre Huguenot Theatre in Bloemfontein. In the same year the television channel SABC2 aired a documentary about her life and career, and in the next year this same channel filmed and broadcast Diva to the nation. Her next project was Vrou by die Spie√´l (Woman at the Mirror), her third CD which she created in collaboration with Didi Kriel and Lize Beekman. She also created a successful concert programme of her own songs, called Strydom in Concert. In a prolific year (1997) Strydom toured Belgium with Vrou by die Spie√´l and State of the Heart, staged the same works at arts festivals in South Africa, and also created the cabaret 'n Vuur gevang in Glas using texts by Hennie Aucamp. She performed 'n Vuur gevang in Glas at the KKNK and also released a CD recording of its songs. Further, she performed all four of her one woman shows alternately over a period of three weeks at the State Theatre in Pretoria. Her fifth CD album, Hotel Royale, was arranged in collaboration with Peter McLea and Didi Kriel, and released in 1998. She arranged it into a concert programme for KKNK the following year, and also created two other programmes called C'est Moi and In Full Flight for various festivals in the country. She then wrote her play Hartlied to be performed at the Aardklop festival in Potchefstroom. In 2000 she performed together with her friend Elzab√© Zietsman in a cabaret titled (Strydom and Zietsman ‚Äì in alphabetical order), and also hosted a European travel documentary for the Afrikaans satellite television channel, KykNet. Strydom's most prolific year may very well have been in 2001, when she wrote and performed four new theatre productions and recorded and released two new CD albums. The theatre productions were Ligvoets (Lightfooted), Die Taal van my Hart (The Language of my Heart), Jazz vir jou en 'n bietjie Blou (Jazz for you and a bit of Blue) and Meisie sings the Blues (Girl sings the Blues). The CD albums were Op 'n Klein Blou Ghoen (On a Small Blue Marble) and a compilation of the show Jazz vir jou en 'n bietjie blou (Jazz for you and a bit of Blue). In the same year she was also attacked viciously by three Rotweillers, but was consoled when Nelson Mandela paid her a personal visit after hearing of the incident. In the following year Strydom was inspired to write Volstoom (Full Steam), a funeral cabaret, which she then premiered at the Aardklop festival in Potchefstroom. She performed her show All by Myself at the Pink Loerie Festival and also at the performance venue on Broadway in Cape Town. Three South African magazines approached Strydom to perform in concert extravaganzas that they were arranging; Huisgenoot invited her to sing in Sun City at their prestigious Skouspel concert, Rooi Rose invited her to sing in Al Daai Jazz (All That Jazz), and Sarie invited her to perform with others in their Inspirasie (Inspiration) concerts. Strydom also won two FNB Vita awards for her work on Op 'n Klein Blou Ghoen. Then, in 2003, Strydom conceived a solo performance and CD album in collaboration with Floors Oosthuizen, Janine Neethling and Vinnie Henrico, which they called Verspreide Donderbuie/Scattered Thunder, a project for which Strydom eventually won two Geraasmusiek awards and a SAMA award. She had two further honours in that year: first, she was honoured by her alma mater, the University of Pretoria with their Tuks Alumni Laureate Award, and secondly, she was invited to attend the historic 85th birthday celebrations of Nelson Mandela in Sandton, Johannesburg. The singer also remembered one of her friends, the late Johannes Kerkorrel, by singing in two remembrance concerts. The first was Hommage a Kerkorrel, performed with Stef Bos at the Stadskouburg in Bruges, Belgium. And then she also sang a tribute she had written for Kerkorrel, the moving song (I dreamt), in Pretoria's State Theatre for the Kerkorrel tribute concert (One year later). Kaalvoet was launched in the following year, a book with lyrics (or poetry) of her songs and photographs from her career. She also helped to rase funds for the Elijah School Fundraising Project by performing her first one-woman show State of Heart in Jeffreys Bay. Together with Christopher she has created Plakboek (Scrapbook) which she performed at Caesars in Johannesburg as well as at the KKNK with fellow songstress, Laurika Rauch. Strydom has also branched into singing Latin American music. In Potchefstroom she was featured as the soloist for Ariel Ram√≠rez's Missa Criola. The work, originally conceived for the tenor voice, proved well-suited to Strydom's own contralto voice, much the same as it did for the Argentinian singer Mercedes Sosa who recorded it in 1999. = Recent work = Strydom's career shows no signs of waning. In recent years she has remained active on the festival scene in South Africa, which is an integral part of any performance career in that country. She sang with the University of Pretoria Symphony Orchestra at the centenary celebrations of her alma mater. The Low Lands have also seen her performing regularly on their stages, singing at venues like the Koninklijk Teater Carr√© in September 2008. Another tour of the Netherlands and Belgium is also planned for 2009. Her most recent CD albums include 'n Rugsak vol Robyne (A Rucksackk full of Rubies) released in 2005 and Kerse teen die donker (Candles against the dark) released in 2008. She is also working on a new project with Lize Beekman.

Six 30-minute episodes aired in the summer of 2008 on digital cable channel Logo, followed by a six episode second summer ‚Äî Gimme Sugar Miami ‚Äî in 2009. While references to a third season can be found, it never aired. Alongside the series, Logo published seventy two bonus clips that covered a variety of lifestyle topics that comprised fashion, cooking, dancing, and exercise. One of the show's writers, Michaline Babich, was named one of ten Amazing Gay Women in Showbiz by the advocacy group POWER UP in 2008. Babich intended to create a show with a diverse cast that would provide entertainment rather than a groundbreaking exploration of lesbian and gay culture. Babich hoped that watching the show for entertainment would advance the acceptance of the LGBTQ+ by society. Cast Season one * Charlene Borja, a club promoter * Bathilda Hsu * Davonee Sou * Alex Thomopoulos, the only bisexual woman of the five Season two Hilary, Olga, Jazmin, Gaby, Omar & Maisi.  Publicity  In 2009 Logo launched a small tour wherein the cast visited different clubs in California and Florida in an attempt to promote and cast for the second season. These events featured the stars of the show and sneak-peeks of the second season.  Reception  The show currently has an 8.7/10 review score on TV.com and a 6.6/10 review on IMDB. The show was applauded for its featuring of lesbian and bisexual women and was the only show on network television with a cast of gay women after the finale of The L Word. = Biphobia Controversy = Throughout the show, the one bisexual character, Alex, is often ridiculed by the other women about being bisexual rather than a lesbian. Michaline Babich, executive producer, commented that Alex was okay with the comments and that Alex, Babich, and other executive producers decided to keep the bi-phobic comments in the show to bring awareness to bisexuality and bisexual discrimination. Babich also commented, \\"Girls give each other a hard time if they smoke or wear the wrong lipstick. At end of day, it has more to do with being 20 and drunk\\".

Most of his demands are met, but there are two outstanding issues which continue to cause an impasse at the FIDE special conference in The Netherlands. Fischer's unresolved demands are firstly, that the match be of unlimited duration and secondly, that the challenger should need to win by two clear games (a minimum of 10-8). After being informed by telephone that FIDE will not accede to his final two demands, Fischer steadfastly holds to the threatened resignation of his title, despite much cajoling by U.S. delegation representative Ed Edmondson and by Florencio Campomanes, the potential match organiser. The title is therefore handed to Karpov by default, and he becomes the first world champion to gain the title this way. Karpov's successes, the USSR's great showing at last year's Olympiad and their subsequent recapture of the World Junior (Chekhov) and World Correspondence (Estrin) titles, indicate that the hitherto Soviet domination of world chess is not yet over. *Nona Gaprindashvili successfully defends her Women's World Championship for the fourth time, by the comfortable margin of 8¬Ω-3¬Ω, against fellow Georgian, Nana Alexandria in Pitsunda/Tbilisi. Gaprindashvili has been the champion since 1962, when she defeated Elisabeth Bykova, the previous holder. *Anatoly Karpov wins in Milan, his first tournament outing since becoming world champion. He wins again in Ljubljana, at the 3rd Vidmar Memorial with 11/15, ahead of Svetozar Gligoriƒá (10/15), Zolt√°n Ribli, Semyon Furman and Vlastimil Hort (all 9¬Ω/15). *Lajos Portisch wins at Wijk aan Zee with 10¬Ω/15, ahead of Vlastimil Hort (10/15) and Jan Smejkal (9¬Ω/15). *In his hometown of Tallinn, Paul Keres wins with 10¬Ω/15, ahead of Fridrik Olafsson and Boris Spassky (both 9¬Ω/15). He also wins in Vancouver, where he delivers simultaneous exhibitions before flying home. In view of his heart attack two years previously and medical advice that he should give up international tournaments, it is believed that his exertions may have been excessive. A further two heart attacks end his life in a Helsinki hospital, just a short time after playing some of the best chess of his career.CHESS magazine - July 1975 p.289 *Ljubomir Ljubojeviƒá has a very successful year, winning three important tournaments. In Manila, he scores 7/10 to head a strong field, including Lev Polugaevsky, Henrique Mecking, Bent Larsen and Helmut Pfleger (2nd-5th, 6/10). There are further victories at Las Palmas' Ruy Lopez Memorial and at the 15th IBM tournament in Amsterdam. *The re-emergence of Tigran Petrosian as the dominant force at the 43rd USSR Chess Championship surprises many, following his disappointing showing at the Alekhine Memorial (sixth place). He scores 10/15, to head up a group of GMs on 9¬Ω/15 (Rafael Vaganian, Boris Gulko, Oleg Romanishin and Mikhail Tal). The tournament is held in Yerevan, Armenia's capital city and the magnanimous victor attributes his success to the support of local fans. *England's Teesside (CHO'D Alexander Memorial) tournament is the strongest in the UK for decades. Efim Geller is triumphant with 9¬Ω/14, ahead of Vasily Smyslov (8¬Ω/14). The players sharing third place are David Bronstein, Robert H√ºbner and Vlastimil Hort (all 8/14). *At Moscow's 3rd Alekhine Memorial, Efim Geller celebrates another good performance, his 10¬Ω/15 edging out Boris Spassky on 10/15. Ratmir Kholmov, Viktor Korchnoi and Rafael Vaganian share third place on 9¬Ω/15. *Lone Pine sees Vladimir Liberzon, a former Soviet grandmaster who had emigrated to Israel take the honours with 7¬Ω/10. Larry Evans finishes second on 7/10, while Walter Browne heads up a number of players on 6¬Ω/10, including Argentinians Oscar Panno and Miguel Quinteros. *Zolt√°n Ribli shines at Budapest, sharing a tournament win with Lev Polugaevsky (both 10¬Ω/15), ahead of Jan Smejkal (9¬Ω/15). *At Ourense, Bent Larsen triumphs with 11¬Ω/15 from Ulf Andersson and Ljubomir Ljubojeviƒá (both 10¬Ω/15). *The tournament at Montilla-Moriles results in a shared win for Lev Polugaevsky and Ivan Radulov, with 6/9. There follows Helmut Pfleger and Lubomir Kavalek (both 5¬Ω/9). *Valery Chekhov takes the World Junior Chess Championship in Tjentiste with 10/13, ahead of Larry Christiansen (9¬Ω/10) and Jonathan Mestel (9/10). England celebrates junior success at the European Junior Chess Championship in Groningen, when John Nunn runs out the winner with 6/9. David Goodman follows up with a second English victory at the World Cadet Championship, in Creil, France. Along with the successes of Tony Miles and Jonathan Mestel in 1974, there is belief that chess in the UK is reaching new levels of popularity. *FIDE President and former world champion, Dr. Max Euwe embarks on two world tours to help popularise chess in Asia and Africa. He finds there is an upsurge of interest in Asia, particularly in The Philippines, where there are 4 million known players. In contrast, African chess development is only in its infancy. *Murray Chandler wins the New Zealand Chess Championship, aged just fifteen. *Yakov Estrin, the Russian over-the-board IM, wins the 7th World Correspondence Chess Championship. *English players Tony Miles and Stewart Reuben agree a draw at the Luton Congress without playing a single move. The last round game is recorded as a draw, but later, after the score-sheets have been scrutinised, the organiser writes to both players requesting the return of the appropriate prize monies, as their actions are deemed an infraction of the rules (‚Äîa player may only offer a draw at the moment he has made a move and must then start the other player's clock).CHESS magazine - May/June 1975 p.242 *Boris Spassky is married to Marina Stcherbatcheff on September 30.

He created roles in numerous world premieres, most notably portraying Arkel in the original production of Claude Debussy's Pell√©as et M√©lisande in 1902 which he went on to sing 208 times at that house.Pell√©as et M√©lisande. L‚ÄôAvant-Sc√®ne Opera. 9, March‚ÄìApril 1977. He possessed a rich voice and a solid technique which helped sustain his career for a long time. His voice is preserved on a number of recordings made on the Odeon, Lyrophon, and Beka labels.  Biography  Vieuille studied at the Conservatoire de Paris with teachers L√©on Achard and Alfred Auguste Giraudet. He made his debut as Leporello in Mozart's Don Giovanni in 1897 at Aix-les-Bains. He joined the Paris Op√©ra-Comique in 1898 where he initially sang supporting roles until he was made a leading bass in 1902, with his first major role being Arkel in the world premi√®re of Debussy's Pell√©as et M√©lisande. Debussy was evidently pleased with Vieuille‚Äôs interpretation of Ark√´l; in a letter to Dufranne (who sang Golaud) at the time of an early revival, he wrote \\"you and Vieuille are almost the only two who have maintained your understanding of my artistic aims\\".Quoted in: Nichols R & Langham-Smith R. Pell√©as et M√©lisande. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1989. Vieuille continued to perform in leading roles at the Op√©ra-Comique up until 1940. He notably created roles in more than twenty world premieres, including Gustave Charpentier's Louise (1900), Henri Rabaud's La fille de Roland (1904), Ariane et Barbe-Bleue (1907), Bloch‚Äôs Macbeth (1910), Rabaud's M√¢rouf, savetier du Caire (1914), and Milhaud‚Äôs Le pauvre matelot (1927) to name just a few. He also sang in the Paris premi√®res of Faur√©‚Äôs P√©n√©lope and Rimsky-Korsakov‚Äôs The Snow Maiden (Grandfather Frost, 1908).J.B. Steane: \\"F√©lix Vieuille\\", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed February 10, 2009), (subscription access) He continued to sing Arkel in performances of Pell√©as et M√©lisande at the Op√©ra-Comique up to 1933, appearing alongside his nephew the baritone Jean Vieuille (as the doctor) from 1930‚Äì33. At this point Vieuille had taken up teaching and his nephew was one of his many pupils. In addition to his appearance at the Op√©ra-Comique, Vieuille also appeared at the Manhattan Opera House in New York City from 1908‚Äì1909 at the invitation of Oscar Hammerstein I. While there he notably sang Arkel in the United States premiere of Pell√©as et M√©lisande among other roles. He also sang in a few productions with Zurich Opera in 1917.

The dependencies of Greenland, Iceland and the Faroe Islands, however, remained part of the reorganised Kingdom of Denmark.

It is mostly made up of Sunni Arabs. Its leading member Atheel al-Nujaifi is brother of Usama al-Najafi who is part of the Iraqi National List led by former Iraqi Prime Minister, Ayad Allawi. It has also been reported that members of the coalition have the backing of Shiite Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.Fractures in Iraq City as Kurds and Baghdad Vie, The New York Times, 2008-10-27, accessed on 2009-01-05 Name The name \\"al-Hadba\\" is a reference to the leaning minaret of the oldest mosque in Mosul. History Hadba Party Seeks to Minimize Kurdish Influence as Mosul Faces a Wave of Assassinations Perhaps the most successful new political party in the recent provincial elections was the Hadba list in Ninevah province, which according to preliminary results received more than 48% of the vote there. Since the announcement of these results a week ago the party has maneuvered to form a political alliance which will allow it to govern the province without depending on Kurdish votes, even as Kurdish politicians seek to ensure that they still have a voice in the new provincial council. Both sides are claiming that their share of council seats will be bigger in the final election results than it was in the preliminary vote tallies, and the Hadba party has announced its efforts to form alliances with a number of smaller political parties. Al-Hadba is an alliance of several smaller parties headed by Atheel Al-Najeefi, whose brother Usama is a member of Ayad Allawi's National Iraqi List in the national parliament. The brothers come from a prominent Mosul family, who have been famous as businessmen and breeders of prize Arabian horses. It is named for the Hadbaa‚Äô Minaret, a tilting structure built more than 800 years ago by Sultan Nour Al-Din, which has been likened to the leaning tower of Pisa and is considered to be a symbol of Mosul's historical identity. The party campaigned as the voice of Mosul's Arab majority, promising to support a strong Iraqi central government and to oppose the annexation of northern Ninevah province by the Kurdistan Regional Government. Kurdish politicians have labeled Hadba leaders as racists and terrorist sympathizers, accusing the party of inciting hatred against Kurds in the province and opposing a fair resolution of territorial disputes. Arabs across Iraq boycotted the 2005 elections which formed the current provincial government, allowing Kurdish parties to control all levels of Ninevah's local government even in the majority-Arab city of Mosul. The Iraqi Army and Police units which patrolled Ninevah were until recently all loyal to the Kurdistan regional government, a situation which especially generated tension in Mosul, which is home to a large number of former Army officers and known for its deep Ba'athist sympathies. The Arab population of Mosul complained of abuse at the hands of Kurdish security forces and objected to the holding of many Arab suspects in prisons deep inside the territory of Kurdistan. The Kurds complain that many of their people have been killed by militant groups such as Al- Qaeda, and say that the recently created Arab police units are infiltrated by terrorist elements. Kurdish politicians in Ninevah have long accepted that their dominance would end with the January 31st provincial elections, but it is almost certain they would have rather had to work with almost any Arab party other than Al-Hadba. The Kurdish alliance in the most recent elections was called the Ninevah Brotherly List, symbolizing its leaders‚Äô desire to work amicably with different groups in the province. They are trying to ensure that they maintain some clout in the new provincial council, to leave the door open to the annexation of northern parts of the province currently controlled by Kurdish military units and to generally prevent Kurdish residents from becoming second-class citizens. A Kurdish parliament member declared on Friday that no Ninevah party would be able to achieve the majority necessary to govern without making alliances, saying that the Brotherly List would receive 30% of the seats after the final results were announced. On Saturday Usama Al- Najeefi responded by saying that the Hadba party could form a governing alliance all by itself, and that his party would in fact receive 60% of the seats after the final count. According to the preliminary results announced a week ago, the Hadba party received 48% of the votes and the Brotherly List received 25%. Al-Hadba has long campaigned to create divisions between Ninevah's smaller minority groups and the Kurds, thus undermining Kurdish efforts to annex the towns where those minorities live. The attempt to split off members of the Yazidi religious sect has been particularly offensive to Kurds who have always considered the Yazidis to be a part of their people; yet in the recent campaign at least some Yazidi politicians came out against Kurdish dominance in Ninevah. Last Tuesday Usama Al-Najeefi held a joint press conference with leaders of the Yazidi Reformist Progressive Front and the Shabak Democratic Assembly to announce an alliance between these two parties and Al-Hadba. Neither of these two parties were listed in the preliminary election results for Ninevah, so it is possible that they were parties that did not achieve the minimum threshold of votes to receive a council seat and are adding their vote tallies to Al-Hadba, or that they were represented by one of the other electoral alliances and are now switching their allegiance. Al-Najeefi also declared his party's willingness to form alliances with other parties in the province, mentioning the Iraqi Islamic Party and the Christian Ishtar List by name. In addition to political maneuvers Mosul has seen a wave of attacks on electoral candidates this week, with an attempt against a Hadba party candidate just today. Ninevah's outgoing Assistant Governor, Khasro Kouran, denied that there were any political motivations behind the continuing assassination attempts, saying that it was a matter of insufficient security and describing the security forces as ‚Äúinfiltrated‚Äù. Leaders Leading members of the party are reported to include: #Atheel al-Nujaifi, who leads the party, a horse breeder in Mosul that once supplied horses to Uday and Qusay Hussein and the brother of the former Minister and Iraqi List MP Usama al-Najafi #Riad al-Chakerji, a retired Army General, an adviser to the government of Nouri al-Maliki and the candidate for the governorship of Ninawa #Sheik Abdullah al-Humaidi al Yawar, the leader of the Shammar tribe, head of the \\"Justice and Reform Movement\\"Mosul protests pit state governor against federal forces, Niqash, 11 May 2011 #Hassan al-Luhaibi, a former Army commander who led the invasion of Kuwait in 1990 #Mr. Arshad Al- Zibari is the leader of Iraqi Kurdish party of freedom and justice.(www.ikfjp.com) #The representative of Al-Hadba in Europe is Mr. Ziad Al-Zibari. He is member of the board of Iraqi Kurdish party of freedom and justice. Policies The party supports the removal of Kurdish peshmerga forces from Ninawa, saying many of the province's insurgent groups would become law-abiding after that. In relation to Ninewa's disputed territories that are claimed by the Kurdish Regional Government, Atheel al-Najafi, the head of the Hadba movement, said in an interview with Niqash that: The representative of Al-Hadba in Europe is Mr. Ziad Zibari.

During the American Civil War, he enlisted in the Union Army on 16 July 1861 and acted as a field artist for Frank Leslie's Weekly while he served as a soldier within the 13th Massachusetts Infantry. Badly wounded at Bull Run, he was discharged on 19 December 1862. After the war, he studied art with Walter Gay, who suggested that he travel to Paris to undertake a formal art education. In 1864, he went to Paris, with his first wife Elizabeth Lord, to study figure painting. He was admitted to the National School of Fine Arts and was one of Alexandre Cabanel's scholars. He went also to Brittany and passing through Pont-Aven, he fell in love with the place. Back in Paris, he mentioned the place to his friends painters. He is credited to have been the first painter from a long group of painters to come to Pont-Aven including Paul Gauguin. This period is known nowadays as the Pont-Aven School. He exhibited at the salon from 1868 through to 1896 with genre works which had found favour with the American market. He also worked as a journalist sending reports of events in Paris to the Boston Daily Evening Transcript. In 1897, he travelled to Egypt for the first time and began regularly spending Winters there. At that time, he switched from oils to watercolours which he believed was the optimal medium to capture the transparent light of the Middle East.Ackerman, G.M., American Orientalists, ACR, 1994, p.14 Bacon died of a heart attack in Cairo, Egypt, in 1912.

He was the eldest son of Wenceslaus I, Duke of Legnica, by his wife Anna, daughter of Casimir I, Duke of Cieszyn. He was born after eight years of childless marriage. Life Rupert's father died in 1364, leaving him and his four siblings under the guardianship of his uncle Louis I the Fair. One year later, with his cousin Henry VII with a Scar -Louis's son-, Rupert joined to the Emperor Charles IV's trip to be crowned King of Arles. Rupert visited then another French cities, including Avignon, where he obtained from the Pope Urban V the annulment of the excommunication over his late father. In 1370 he participated in the Sejm Reich in Nuremberg, where for the first time, Rupert manifest his political views. The regency of Louis I the Fair was longer: only in 1373 Rupert began his personal rule over Legnica. Despite the inclusion of his brother Wenceslaus II as a co-rule, Rupert maintain the full government over the Duchy, but always with the close cooperation of his uncle. Thanks to the pressure of Louis, Rupert signed an agreement with his younger brothers on 2 December 1372, under which they accepted not divided the Duchy of Legnica between them for the next ten years. The agreement was extended in subsequent years, and allowed Rupert to exercise full control over Legnica at expense of his younger brothers, who, although they are co-rulers, none of them had any real power. In later years, Rupert was actively involved in the dynastic struggles over the Silesian inheritance. On 21 May 1379 was concluded a treaty between Rupert and King Wenceslaus IV, who stipulated that after Rupert's homage to Wenceslaus as his vassal, the King guaranteed his total possession over the inheritance of all the descendants of Boles≈Çaw III the Generous. Unfortunately, on 6 January 1383, Rupert had to give up his claims over the Duchies of Wroclaw, Schweidnitz and Jawor. After the death of Henry VIII the Sparrow, Duke of G≈Çog√≥w-≈ªaga≈Ñ on 14 March 1397, Rupert took the regency on behalf of his minor sons, until 1401. The successive deaths of Louis I the Fair (6 December 1398) and his son Henry VII (11 July 1399) left Rupert as the Head of the Silesian Legnica-Brieg branch, who allowed him to act as a mediator in the disputes of his Silesian relatives (for example in 1399 between the Dukes of Opole and the Bishop of Lubusz, Jan Borschnitzem, and in 1400, with the sons of Henry VII, who wanted to share their dominions). In the internal politics, the two main problems of Rupert was to pay the debts of both father and grandfather (who were successfully cancelled) and avoid problems with the Church (who was finally ended with the election of his younger brother Wenceslaus II as Bishop of Wroclaw). Like his uncle Louis I, Rupert was a generous protector of the arts. One of the artist supported by him was the Brieg canon Piotr Byczyny, who write the \\"Chronicles of Polish Dukes\\". Rupert died around 12 January 1409 and was buried in the Church of God (pl: Bo≈ºego Grobu) of Legnica. Marriage and issue By 10 February 1372, Rupert married with Hedwig (ca. 1350 ‚Äì 27 March 1390), daughter of Henry V of Iron, Duke of ≈ªaga≈Ñ and widow of King Casimir III the Great of Poland. They had two daughters: #Barbara (ca. 1384 ‚Äì Trebitz, 9 May 1436), married on 6 March 1396 to Rudolph III, Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg and Elector of Saxony. Through this union, Rupert was a direct ancestor of the Kings of Denmark and the House of Gonzaga, rulers of Mantua and Montferrato. #Agnes (before 1385 ‚Äì after 7 July 1411), a nun in Wroclaw.

He was one of the famous artists in the era of Weimar republic. Jury for the Berlin Secession 1908 exhibition. From the left: sculptors Fritz Klimsch and August Gaul, painters Walter Leistikow and Hans Baluschek, art dealer Paul Cassirer, painters Max Slevogt (sitting) and George Mosson (standing), sculptor Max Kruse, painters Max Liebermann (sitting), Emil Rudolf Weiss and Lovis Corinth. Early Life Klimsch was born on 10 February 1870 in Frankfurt am Main to a family of artists, studying at the Royal College for the Academic Fine Arts in Berlin, and was then a student of Fritz Schaper. In 1898, Klimsch was a founding member of the Berlin Secession. His work was also part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics. Career After the seizure of power by the Nazis, they ordered artworks at the established artist, e.g. busts of Adolf Hitler, Erich Ludendorff and Wilhelm Frick. According to a diary entry by Joseph Goebbels, Klimsch was the most mature of our sculptors. A genius.. In September 1944, Goebbels added Klimsch to the Gottbegnadeten list, a list of prominent artists considered crucial to Nazi Culture, and became one of only 12 visual artists to be featured on the list. After Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II, Klimsch and his family settled in Salzburg, Austria, but in 1946 was deported by the local burgermeister, Richard Hildmann, for being a German citizen. The family moved to Freiburg im Breisgau, in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, West Germany. Klimsch's was never a member of the Nazi Party, but being honored by the Nazi regime made him a controversial post-war figure, and led to his expulsion from the academy of the arts in 1955. However shortly before his death in 1960, Klimsch received the Federal Cross of Merit from Hans Filbinger, the Minister President of Baden- W√ºrttemberg, on his 90th birthday. Death Kilmsch died on 30 March 1960 in Freiburg im Breisgau, and was buried in Saig bei Lenzkirch, where he was an honorary citizen.

The Northampton‚ÄìMarket Harborough line is a closed railway line in England. It opened on 16 February 1859 and finally closed on 16 August 1981. The former trackbed is used by the Brampton Valley Way and part of the route has been re-opened as the Northampton & Lamport Railway. History In 1851, large deposits of ironstone were discovered in Northamptonshire. The London and North Western Railway (LNWR) proposed a new railway line between Northampton and Market Harborough. The line was designed by George R. Stephenson (nephew of the Railway Pioneer George Stephenson) and George Parker Bidder, and was opened in 1859. The line includes two tunnels: Kelmarsh Tunnel, ; and Oxendon Tunnel on the Down line and on the Up line. Because the line was originally single track and later doubled, each tunnel consists of two separate bores, one for each track. One bore of each tunnel is open as part of the Brampton Valley Way. In the British Rail report \\"British Railways Network for Development\\" of March 1967, the line was shown as part of the passenger and freight network for development. At about the same time, the two road overbridges along the line were rebuilt in order to provide clearances for 25 kV 50 Hz electrification, which was to be carried through to Leicester. At the time, it was envisaged that the Midland Main Line between Market Harborough and Bedford (despite also being included as \\"for development\\" in the report) would be closed to passengers, with services between London and Leicester re-routed via Northampton railway station to London Euston, along with the closure and demolition of London St. Pancras Station. The closure of St. Pancras and the electrification between Northampton and Market Harborough did not take place but the raised overbridges are still visible at Brampton and Brixworth station sites. Stations When the line opened, there were only three intermediate stations, at Pitsford, Brixworth and Lamport. Further stations were opened, although almost all were closed by 1960. * * ‚Äì originally a minor station   * The original LNWR station at was on its to line which opened in 1850. From 1857 it was shared by the Midland Railway on the \\"London Extension\\" from to . As traffic built up, the Midland built a new line at a higher elevation, crossing the LNWR and then running parallel to a new joint station in the present position, which opened in 1885.Radford, B., (1983) Midland Line Memories: a Pictorial History of the Midland Railway Main Line Between London (St Pancras) & Derby London: Bloomsbury Books Brixworth Station in 1965 Closure 25181 and 25106 lead an aggreate train towards Northampton at Merry Tom Crossing 06:50 1975-06-13 Class 20s 8137 and 8042 lead northbound coal empties past the site of Spratton station on Sunday 1973-03-18. At this time, the line was normally open from 22:00 to 14:00, Mondays to Saturdays. On this occasion, Sunday opening was necessary to clear a traffic backlog after industrial action by rail workers. The line had a staggered history in its final years. It was first closed to advertised passenger traffic on 4 January 1960 along with all remaining intermediate stations (Spratton station was closed during in 1947; Pitsford & Brampton in 1950) but was re-opened to through traffic on 6 January 1969 in conjunction with the re-routing of sleeping car services away from St. Pancras. The one train each way per night was electrically hauled between Euston and Northampton and by a Class 45 locomotive between Northampton and Glasgow. It did not call at Market Harborough. The line was closed to passenger traffic again on 1 May 1969 and reopened on 10 July 1972. The advertised passenger service was finally withdrawn on 26 August 1973, although the line continued to be used by freight trains, football specials and as a diversionary route. During the 1960s and 1970s, the staple traffic declined considerably, consisting principally of coal trains from the Nottinghamshire coalfields to London and their northbound empties. The line had several manual level crossings. Each of these required a mechanical signalbox to be maintained and staffed, leading to high fixed costs, which were only slightly reduced by staffing the boxes for only one or two shifts per day, according to traffic needs. Proposals to automate the level crossings were met with hostility by locals in the wake of the Hixon rail crash. Although the line was considered useful by the operators as a diversionary route, the high costs and diminishing coal traffic led to its closure at a time when British Rail was under great pressure from government to close marginal lines. On 15 August 1981, the day before closure, a special train was chartered to run from Northampton to Market Harborough and return. This was the last British Rail passenger train to run on the line. Heritage Railway The Welland Valley Rail Revival Group which had campaigned to keep the line open changed its name to Northampton Steam Railway and based itself in the old goods yard at Pitsford and Brampton station. The track was lifted by British Rail and the trackbed was sold to Northamptonshire County Council for use as a \\"linear park\\" named the Brampton Valley Way. The Railway Society arranged to lease part of the trackbed from the County Council and began rebuilding the line as a heritage railway. The name was changed in 1992 to Northampton & Lamport Railway due to the presence of a large number of diesel locomotives. A Light Railway Order was granted and the Grand Opening took place on 31 March 1996.

Government ombudsman services are free to the public, like many other ombudsman and dispute resolution services, and are a means of resolving disputes outside of the court systems. Australia has an ombudsman assigned for each state; as well as an ombudsman for the Commonwealth of Australia. As laws differ between states just one process, or policy, cannot be used across the Commonwealth. All government bodies are within the jurisdiction of the ombudsman. The Commonwealth Ombudsman is also the Defence Force Ombudsman, Immigration Ombudsman, Postal Industry Ombudsman, Law Enforcement Ombudsman, VET Student Loans Ombudsman, Overseas Students Ombudsman and the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman. Many industries, such as aged care, banking, energy and water, telecommunications, etc, also have ombudsmen or similar bodies that assist with dispute resolution.  Commonwealth Ombudsman  The Commonwealth Ombudsman in Australia was established in 1977.Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman 40th Anniversary The Ombudsman can investigate complaints from people who believe they have been treated unfairly or unreasonably by an Australian Government department / agency or prescribed private sector organisation, including Australia Post, Centrelink, Child Support and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. The Commonwealth Ombudsman is also the Defence Force Ombudsman, Immigration Ombudsman, Postal Industry Ombudsman, Law Enforcement Ombudsman, VET Student Loans Ombudsman, Overseas Students Ombudsman and the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman. Through an arrangement with the Government of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), the Commonwealth Ombudsman is also the ACT Ombudsman. The Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman (the Office) also delivers an International Program, funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, to improve the governance and accountability in the Asia-Pacific region, and supports and monitors the administration by other agencies of the Public Interest Disclosure (PID) scheme established under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013. In addition, the Ombudsman has a number of statutory oversight functions in relation to law enforcement agencies' use of special powers, including those under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979, Surveillance Devices Act 2004 and Part 1AB of the Crimes Act 1914. The current Commonwealth Ombudsman is Michael Manthorpe.  State ombudsmen  The various states in Australia have (variously described) state Ombudsman offices, with similar jurisdiction as described above, except over state government authorities. There is much collaboration in an academic sense between Ombudsmen in Australia, given the highly similar nature of their roles (despite differing jurisdictions). The offices frequently work on joint projects, such as those addressing difficult client behaviour. = New South Wales Ombudsman = The first NSW Ombudsman was appointed in 1975 and the legislation became operative in May that year. Since then, there have been many changes ‚Äì public authorities have merged and separated and there have been seven different Ombudsmen.

The current Queensland Ombudsman is Anthony Reilly, who was appointed to the role in July 2020.https://www.ombudsman.qld.gov.au/ Queensland Ombudsman website = Tasmanian Ombudsman = The Tasmanian Ombudsman investigates complaints regarding public authority administrative action and contravention of state privacy legislation, conducts Freedom of Information reviews in respect of government agencies and can accept public interest disclosures (i.e. whistleblowing complaints) and other miscellaneous functions (e.g. auditing of police telephone interception warrants). The current Ombudsman from March 2012 is Leon Atkinson-MacEwen.http://www.ombudsman.tas.gov.au/ Tasmanian Ombudsman website Industry and organisational ombudsmen Unlike the government run ombudsman services, industry-based ombudsman resolve complaints made against their members, who are required to pay a yearly membership fee. Industry-based ombudsmen generally operate according to a constitution and are claimed to be impartial in their decision-making. That is, they are said to not take sides‚Äîthey are often required to act neither as an industry nor a consumer advocate. Like government run ombudsman services, the services of external/alternative dispute resolution (ADR) are sometimes free for consumers. The costs of the ombudsman services are usually charged to its members on a case by case basis, or can be determined on the number of complaints that the company has received for that financial year. Generally the providers in a particular industry (for example telecommunications, energy and water, credit, insurance, public transport) are required to be members of an independent External Dispute Resolution scheme (EDR). A Board or Council with representatives of both industry and consumers as well as an independent Chair, is responsible for the operation of an industry-based Ombudsman. The Board or Council appoints the Ombudsman. Government or an independent regulator, such as the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) may be involved by approving the scheme and ensuring that it complies with certain standards. Sometimes a Government Ombudsman is also an industry Ombudsman. An industry-based Ombudsman typically charges each member according to the number and/or the complexity of complaints it receives about the company. While the development of these facilities over the last 20 years has \\"lifted industry dispute resolution standards\\", the industry schemes have \\"stalled and cannot be described as world best practice\\". =Energy and water= * Energy and Water Ombudsman (New South Wales)Energy & Water Ombudsman NSW website * Energy and Water Ombudsman (Victoria) (EWOV)Energy & Water Ombudsman (Victoria) website * Energy and Water Ombudsman (SA)Energy and Water Ombudsman (SA) website * Energy Ombudsman of TasmaniaEnergy Ombudsman of Tasmania website * Energy and Water Ombudsman Queensland (EWOQ): a free, fair and independent dispute resolution scheme for residential and small business consumers in Queensland who have a complaint about their electricity, gas or water provider.

On April 5, 1987 it collapsed due to bridge scour at the foundations after a record rainfall. The collapse killed ten people. The replacement bridge was completed and fully open to traffic on May 21, 1988. The failure of the Schoharie Creek Bridge motivated improvement in bridge design and inspection procedures within New York and beyond.Keary H. LeBeau and Sara J. Wadia- Fascetti. (2007). \\"Fault Tree Analysis of Schoharie Creek Bridge Collapse,\\" Journal of Performance of Constructed Facilities, Vol. 21, Issue 4, pp. 320-326. Bridge design and construction The final design for the bridge was approved in January 1952 by the New York State Department of Transportation (previously the New York State Department of Public Works). The design described a crossing consisting of five simply supported spans with nominal lengths of , , , , and . The bridge was supported with pier frames along with abutments at each end. The pier frames were constructed of two slightly tapered columns with tie beams. The columns were fixed in place within a lightly reinforced plinth positioned on a shallow, reinforced spread footing. The spread footing was to be protected with a dry layer of riprap.Jacob Feld, and Kenneth L. Carper (1997). \\"Construction Failure\\" John Wiley and Sons. , . The superstructure consisted of two longitudinal main girders with transverse floor beams. The skeleton of the bridge deck ( thick) was made up of steel stringers. Construction began on February 11, 1953 by B. Perini and Sons, Inc. Service The bridge was partially opened during the summer of 1954 before construction was completed. The Schoharie Creek Bridge (NY 1020940, New York State bridge identification number), began full service beginning in October 1954. In the spring and summer of 1955, the pier plinths began to show vertical cracks ranging from , as a result of high tensile stresses in the concrete plinth. Almost a year later, on October 16, 1955, the bridge was damaged by a flood. In 1957, plinth reinforcement was added to each of the four piers. Collapse On the morning of April 5, 1987, during a high spring flood, the Schoharie Creek Bridge collapsed. A snowmelt combined with rainfall totaling produced an estimated 50-year flood on the creek. Pier three was the first to collapse, which caused the progressive collapse of spans three and four. Ninety minutes later pier two and span two collapsed. Two hours later pier one and span one shifted. A National Transportation Safety Board investigation suggested that pier two collapsed because the wreckage of pier three and the two spans may have partially blocked the river, redirecting and increasing the velocity of the flow of water to pier two. Six days later, upstream, a large section of the Mill Point Bridge collapsed. The bridge had been closed since the flood as a precaution, since inspection showed that its foundations had also been eroded. Casualties At the time of the collapse, one car and one tractor-semitrailer were on the bridge. Before the road could be blocked off, three more cars drove into the gap. During the following three weeks, nine bodies were recovered from the river. The body of the 10th victim was recovered from the Mohawk River in July 1989. Causes of failure It was concluded that the bridge collapsed due to extensive scour under pier three. The foundation of the pier was bearing on erodible soil, consisting of layers of gravel, sand and silt, inter-bedded with folded and tilted till. This allowed high velocity flood waters to penetrate the bearing stratum. The area left around the footing was not filled with riprap stone, but instead was back-filled with erodible soil and topped off with dry riprap. Riprap protection, inspection, and maintenance were determined to have been inadequate. The investigations showed that the scouring process under the piers began shortly after the bridge was built. At the time of the collapse, the upstream end of pier 3 fell into a scour hole approximately deep. Investigators estimated that about of the pier was undermined. The design for the Schoharie Creek Bridge originally called for leaving sheet piles in place (which are used to keep water out of excavation areas during construction). The riprap would have filled the area left between the pier footings and the sheeting. However, this sheeting was not left in place. Another reason for the collapse was the weight of the riprap. The design specification called for riprap with 50 percent of the stones heavier than , and the remainder between . Investigators found that heavier riprap weights of should have been specified. Other considerations as to the cause of the collapse included design of the superstructure, quality of materials and construction, and inspection and maintenance. Investigations found that these factors did not contribute to the collapse. Twelve hours before the Schoharie Creek Bridge collapsed due to heavy rainfall, the rush of water through the Blenheim-Gilboa Pumped Storage Power Project upstream hit a historic high. To cope with the overload, the dam released water into the Schoharie Creek according to the rate at which it was entering the reservoir from upstream, adding to the load in the creek.

Early life Growing up as one of two sons of a career musician (drummer Ken Brooks), it was not really til he was 11 or 12 that Brooks realised that being a musician could be a career. He knew his father played the drums and that he was \\"bloody good at it\\" and that he did it a lot, but it was not until his own life-altering experiences with music that Brooks realised he could make a living and a lifelong pursuit out of music. In 1986 John Farnham made a comeback, and Farnham's new band featured Brett Garsed on guitar. A concert for the \\"Whispering Jack\\" album was broadcast on Australian prime-time TV and featured a tune called \\"Let Me Out\\", the extended Garsed guitar solo of which Brooks credits as a major turning point in his inspiration to resume playing the guitar. Brooks cites other early influences as Kee Marcello of the band Europe, Vinnie Moore and Yngwie Malmsteen. The 1990s and 2000s Brooks attended the Australian Institute of Music for a certificate course in contemporary music. During his short time there Brooks was exposed to jazz fusion and began listening to guitar instrumentalists like Frank Gambale, Allan Holdsworth, Pat Metheny and Richie Kotzen. Demo tapes recorded in the 90s on four-track tapes have since shown up on YouTube, including a cover of the Yngwie Malmsteen track \\"Black Star\\", and the original track \\"I Wonder Why\\". On 9 March 2002, Brooks released his debut album The Master Plan, which showcased his guitar chops in dynamic and sometimes complex progressive metal / rock fusion influenced compositions. The album has (as of January 2009) sold 4,000 copies and gained critical acclaim from artists including Brett Garsed, Vinnie Moore, and Jon Finn. Press coverage of the album included Metal Hammer magazine (Greece), Burrn! magazine (Japan) and Young Guitar magazine (Japan) as well as numerous fan-maintained progressive rock/metal websites. In 2003 Brooks joined the Sydney-based melodic rock band Feeding The Addiction. The band failed to have any success besides a publishing deal with Sony/BMG. Brooks left the group in 2006 to return to the instrumental guitar genre, beginning with the opening track \\"Unruly Elements\\" from the 2007 Liquid Note Records (UK) release \\"The Alchemists II\\". The album also boasted the talents of Brett Garsed, Terry Syrek, Guns N' Roses guitarist Bumblefoot and James LaBrie sideman Marco Sfogli. In September 2011, the second solo album \\"The Axis of All Things\\" was released under the label Axiology Records, a moniker for Brooks' self-released efforts. The album featured guest appearances from Brett Garsed, Rick Graham, and drummers Peter McDonaugh and Gordon Rytmeister. In 2017, Brooks signed to publisher Fundamental Changes and released his first book on 17 October entitled \\"Neoclassical Speed Strategies for Guitar\\".http://www.fundamental- changes.com/book/neoclassical-speed-strategies-for-guitar/ The book is a biomechanical breakdown of the picking style of guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen. Guest appearances In 2002 Brooks wrote and appeared on two songs on the Mark Boals album Edge of the World, which also featured guitarist Tony MacAlpine (Ring of Fire), drummers Virgil Donati and Vinny Appice of Black Sabbath and Dio, and keyboardist Erik Norlander. The album was released by the labels Marquee Inc in Japan and Frontiers Records worldwide. Brooks also appeared on the Australian metal band LORD's 2007 release Ascendence, on which he contributed guitars to the tracks \\"Rain\\" and \\"Through the Fire\\". In 2009 LORD released a new album entitled Set in Stone, which features a new Chris Brooks solo on the track \\"Be My Guest\\". Guitar style and gear Brooks is renowned for his speedpicking and legato technique and melodic phrasing which result in a fluid improvisational style. Brooks used Ibanez guitars for the first few years of his recording career and has been seen on numerous YouTube videos using a 2004 Paul Reed Smith Custom 24 guitar in vintage Yellow finish, and a customised 1997 American Fender Stratocaster in Teal Green Metallic finish and white pearloid pickguard. In February 2020, Brooks became an endorsing artist for Charvel Guitars.https://www.facebook.com/chrisbrooksguitar/videos/2556526554620109/ Discography *The Master Plan (2002) *The Axis of All Things (2011) References ;Citations ;Notes *Biography *Interview External links * *Interview at Instrumental Case website Category:Australian rock guitarists Category:Living people Category:Australian heavy metal guitarists Category:1974 births Category:Australian Institute of Music alumni Category:21st-century guitarists ","title":"Chris Brooks (guitarist)"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function H(s,a,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your wikitable ü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",R,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),w(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const I=d(P,[["render",H]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/31.md","filePath":"quotes/31.md"}'),L={name:"quotes/31.md"},x=Object.assign(L,{setup(s){return(a,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(I)]))}});export{D as __pageData,x as default};
