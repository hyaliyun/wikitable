In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) guns. Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A \\"Y-gun\\" depth charge thrower was added to many ships.Friedman, pp. 44‚Äì45 Construction and career Marcus, named for Arnold Marcus, was laid down 20 May 1919 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, San Francisco, California; launched 22 August 1919; sponsored by Mrs. Arnold Marcus, widow of Lieutenant (jg.) Marcus; and commissioned 23 February 1921, Lieutenant Commander C. E. Rosendahl in command. Marcus, after completion of her shakedown cruise, was assigned to destroyer squadron duty with the Pacific Fleet. As a unit of Squadron 13, and later Squadron 12, she operated off the West Coast, her cruises ranging from Seattle, Washington to Panama. In early 1924, February‚ÄìMarch, she joined other ships of the battle force in fleet maneuvers based on a simulated attack on the Panama Canal. From April through July 1925, she participated in fleet tactical problems in the Hawaiian Islands area. She then returned to her regular operations schedule until 1927. During March and April of that year she again sailed south to take part in Caribbean fleet maneuvers, following which she returned to the West Coast. Between 1927 and 1929, she made several voyages to Honolulu; one, a Naval Reserve training cruise, two others as carrier screen. In September 1929, Marcus was ordered to San Diego, California where she decommissioned 31 May 1930. Disposed of in accordance with the terms of the London Naval Treaty, she was struck from the Navy list 28 January 1935 and sunk by gunfire 25 June 1935. As of 2005, no other ships in the United States Navy have been named Marcus.

Experiments with tournament-quality chess, checkers, and Othello programs show it to be a highly efficient minimax algorithm. The name MTD(f) is an abbreviation for MTD(n,f) (Memory-enhanced Test Driver with node and value ). It is an alternative to the alpha-beta pruning algorithm.  Origin  MTD(f) was first described in a University of Alberta Technical Report authored by Aske Plaat, Jonathan Schaeffer, Wim Pijls, and Arie de Bruin,\\"Adaptive Strategies of MTD-f for Actual Games\\". Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology. K SHIBAHARA et al which would later receive the ICCA Novag Best Computer Chess Publication award for 1994/1995. The algorithm MTD(f) was created out of a research effort to understand the SSS* algorithm, a best-first search algorithm invented by George Stockman in 1979. SSS* was found to be equivalent to a series of alpha- beta calls, provided that alpha-beta used storage, such as a well-functioning transposition table. The name MTD(f) stands for Memory-enhanced Test Driver, referencing Judea Pearl's Test algorithm, which performs Zero-Window Searches. MTD(f) is described in depth in Aske Plaat's 1996 PhD thesis.  Zero-window searches  MTD(f) derives its efficiency by only performing zero-window alpha-beta searches, with a \\"good\\" bound (variable beta). In NegaScout, the search is called with a wide search window, as in AlphaBeta(root, ‚àíINFINITY, +INFINITY, depth), so the return value lies between the value of alpha and beta in one call. In MTD(f), AlphaBeta fails high or low, returning a lower bound or an upper bound on the minimax value, respectively. Zero-window calls cause more cutoffs, but return less information - only a bound on the minimax value. To find the minimax value, MTD(f) calls AlphaBeta a number of times, converging towards it and eventually finding the exact value. A transposition table stores and retrieves the previously searched portions of the tree in memory to reduce the overhead of re-exploring parts of the search tree.  Pseudocode  function MTDF(root, f, d) is g := f upperBound := +‚àû lowerBound := ‚àí‚àû while lowerBound < upperBound do Œ≤ := max(g, lowerBound + 1) g := AlphaBetaWithMemory(root, Œ≤ ‚àí 1, Œ≤, d) if g < Œ≤ then upperBound := g else lowerBound := g return g ; : First guess for best value. The better the quicker the algorithm converges. Could be 0 for first call. ; : Depth to loop for. An iterative deepening depth-first search could be done by calling multiple times with incrementing and providing the best previous result in .https://people.csail.mit.edu/plaat/mtdf.html  Performance  NegaScout calls the zero-window searches recursively. MTD(f) calls the zero-window searches from the root of the tree. Implementations of the MTD(f) algorithm have been shown to be more efficient (search fewer nodes) in practice than other search algorithms (e.g. NegaScout) in games such as chess , checkers, and Othello. For search algorithms such as NegaScout or MTD(f) to perform efficiently, the transposition table must work well. Otherwise, for example when a hash-collision occurs, a subtree will be re-expanded. When MTD(f) is used in programs suffering from a pronounced odd-even effect, where the score at the root is higher for even search depths and lower for odd search depths, it is advisable to use separate values for f to start the search as close as possible to the minimax value. Otherwise, the search would take more iterations to converge on the minimax value, especially for fine grained evaluation functions. Zero-window searches hit a cut-off sooner than wide- window searches. They are therefore more efficient, but, in some sense, also less forgiving, than wide-window searches. Because MTD(f) only uses zero- window searches, while Alpha-Beta and NegaScout also use wide window searches, MTD(f) is more efficient. However, wider search windows are more forgiving for engines with large odd/even swings and fine-grained evaluation functions. For this reason some chess engines have not switched to MTD(f). In tests with tournament-quality programs such as Chinook (checkers), Phoenix (chess), and Keyano (Othello), the MTD(f) algorithm outperformed all other search algorithms. Recent algorithms like Best Node Search is suggested to outperform MTD(f).

After writing and recording new material in late 2004 and early 2005, Anastasio began auditioning various musicians for his next project. This band essentially replaced Anastasio's first backup band that was together in different forms from 1999 to 2004. 70 Volt Parade originally included Peter Chwazik on bass (later replaced by Tony Hall), Skeeto Valdez on drums (later replaced by Raymond Weber), Les Hall on guitar and keyboards, and Ray Paczkowski also on keyboards. In 2006, with Les Hall out of the lineup, and a new musical focus for Anastasio, the 70 Volt Parade name was dropped. Music While 70 Volt Parade primarily performed new material that Anastasio has written and recorded since the breakup of Phish, the band played songs from all points of Anastasio's solo career, which began in 1998. He also performed the Phish song \\"46 Days\\" with the new band on a regular basis, as well as songs from the supergroup Oysterhead. Also, unlike Anastasio's past bands, performances usually have an opening act. Anastasio and 70 Volt Parade have also served as an opening act for The Rolling Stones and The Black Crowes. One of the highlights of the band's inaugural tour was the \\"Superjam\\" in New Orleans on April 30, 2005, which included special guests Mike Gordon, Dave Matthews, Cyril Neville and Sunpie Barnes, among others. Starting with the August 6, 2005 concert at Tommy Hilfiger at Jones Beach Theater, shows featured Anastasio performing a solo acoustic set in the middle or end of each concert, instead of a traditional set break. Most of the songs performed during these sets were from the Phish catalog. During the band's fall tour, the other three members of Phish each made a guest appearance. Page McConnell played with Anastasio at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City. Mike Gordon joined Trey onstage at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City. Jon Fishman and Gordon later performed at a show in Utica, New York that was heavily promoted on Anastasio's website. McConnell and Fishman's appearances marked the first time either musician had performed with Anastasio in front of a live audience since Coventry. Zooma Tour Cancellation In the summer of 2005, Anastasio and 70 Volt Parade were scheduled to co-headline the festival- like Zooma Tour along with Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals. The tour, which featured an intensive schedule covering venues throughout the United States, was cancelled due to poor ticket sales. Anastasio then scheduled a brief summer tour in its place. Lineup Changes #On July 24, 2005, at the 10,000 Lakes Festival, Tony Hall replaced Peter Chwazik on bass. Hall (no relation to guitarist Les Hall) had recently played with Trey as a member of Dave Matthews and Friends. Also, two backup singers were added, Jennifer Hartswick, from Anastasio's previous band and her childhood friend, Christina Durfee. #On November 18, 2005, Raymond Weber replaced Skeeto Valdez on drums. Both Weber and Tony Hall are members of Ivan Neville's Dumpstaphunk, a New Orleans funk outfit in the Neville tradition. #Also on the fall tour, the two female singers began playing horns on selected songs (Jen on trumpet and tuba and Christina on trombone). Hartswick had played trumpet and tuba, as well as sung in Anastasio's old band. #The band also added Russell Remington, also from Trey's old band (and who performed with Phish on many occasions as a member of The Giant Country Horns) on saxophone and flute. Record Label Trey Anastasio's 2005 release, Shine, marked the first release by Anastasio since the formation of the 70 Volt Parade. Although the group does not perform on the album, they appeared in the video for the album's title track, as well as on the bonus features on the video side of the album's Dual Disc. The album, unlike its predecessors by Trey Anastasio & Phish, was released on Columbia Records. The switch of labels for Anastasio led to a delay in digital recordings of 2005 shows being available for sale on the Live Phish website.

Making things worse, Colorado has passed a statewide ban on fireworks after a kid in North Park had his arms blown off. In response, Jimbo and Ned travel to Mexico to purchase illegal fireworks. Meanwhile, Mayor McDaniels, discovering that snakes are still legal, has the largest one ever made for the town's Independence Day celebration. It is not until it has been lit that the mayor becomes concerned of its expiration; upon asking the manufacturer, they realize it will be impossible to extinguish and will not burn out until November of the following year. The ash travels across the town and country, destroying everything in its wake. Meanwhile, Mr. Garrison begins to have a nervous breakdown because his companion, Mr. Hat, has disappeared. He sees Dr. Katz in New York, who says that he is gay and Mr. Hat is really his gay side \\"trying to come out\\". Garrison rudely brushes him off, just as the giant snake kills him. Cartman, at this time, is taking swimming lessons, but has to contend with first graders urinating in the pool. Jimbo and Ned are captured by the border patrol after Jimbo accidentally revealed they were carrying illegal fireworks, but manage to escape (thanks to the snake) and head back to South Park with their fireworks. The boys finally get their fireworks, and when they shoot them off, they destroy the snake trail. The ashes rain to the ground like snow, and people participate in winter activities using the black soot. Mr. Garrison returns with a new companion, Mr. Twig. During this time, Cartman, being the only person in the pool, has decided to swim all the way from the shallow end of the pool to the deep end. He is successful, but is angered when the first graders return and immediately turn the entirety of the pool water into urine. Chef returns to South Park from vacation, and when he sees everyone's faces covered in the black ash which makes them look like they're wearing blackface, he prepares to give everyone a beating.

The platen is the sturdy plate which applies the pressure to the paper and type. A platen (or platten) is a flat platform with a variety of roles in printing or manufacturing. It can be a flat metal (or earlier, wooden) plate pressed against a medium (such as paper) to cause an impression in letterpress printing.http://www.merriam- webster.com/dictionary/platen Platen may also refer to a typewriter roller which friction-feeds paper into position below the typebars or print head, it can refer to the glass surface of a copier, or it can refer to the rotating disk used to polish semiconductor wafers. Other applications =Office equipment= Copier In office copiers and scanners, the platen is a flat glass surface on which operators place papers or books for scanning. The platen is also called the flatbed. Platens are also used in some printers, such as the Dot-matrix printer. (see image) =Manufacturing and processing= A planar in semiconductor wafer polishing In semiconductor manufacturing, specifically chemical-mechanical planarization, a flat, rotating platen covered with a pad is used to polish semiconductor wafers. (see image) In textile screen printing, a platen is a flat board onto which the operator slides the garment. It is generally made of either a plywood laminate or aluminum with a rubber laminate. Often the platen will be pretreated with a spray adhesive. This allows the garment to effectively become a rigid immobile substrate, especially important when printing multiple colors or utilizing an on-press infrared dryer. The screen is brought parallel and close to the garment (often within 1/32\\") and the squeegee pressure then brings the screen into contact with the garment so that the ink transfer may occur. There are many special platen types, such as those for printing sleeves or pockets, vacuum platens, platens with clamps to hold bulky materials such as jackets, and even curved platens for printing on hats. In woodworking, wide belt sanders use platens to press the sanding paper into contact with the wood being sanded. The platen sits between two steel rolls which deliver the moving force to the sanding belt. Sanding heads with a platen are used on finish sanding with papers of finer grits, when the coarser ones are typically used with contact drum type sanding heads. Stock is fed into and out of the machine on a conveyor belt. Since the abrasive belt creates a substantial pressure on the stock that tends to push the stock toward the infeed, the hold down shoes and rollers hold the workpiece down against the belt while it is moving through the machine in order to ensure uniform contact with the abrasive and continuous movement. In metal forming processes, a platen is the component that houses the mold for forging the required shape. The platen tends to be the heaviest and strongest part of the press due to the massive forces that it has to withstand. A platen for a 5000-ton press can weigh up to 350 tons. In manufacturing, a platen is a flat plate of a press utilized in laminate, plastic and forest product industries . A platen is typically heated with oil, water, steam or electricity and is used in the production of furniture, tires, gaskets, particle board, composite heaters and plywood. In high frequency welding products, platens are used to put lines on PVC binders and folders down the spine lines. Platens are utilized in impact testing in research; a specimen is crushed between platens. The platen also refers to the fixed part of a linear motor.

History The unit was established on 28 August 1985 following the withdrawal of the RAF Marine Craft Unit No. 1102. The two motor launches attached to the previous unit, HMAFV Sunderland and Stirling, remained however and were subsequently renamed HM ships Hart and Cormorant respectively. Both vessels remained with the squadron until May 1991 when they were replaced by the new P2000 patrol boats HM Ships Ranger and Trumpeter. These in turn remained with the squadron until 2003. Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, security arrangements for the squadron were enhanced and the unit received yet another new pair of patrol boats, HMS Sabre and HMS Scimitar, as well as three new RHIBs, in September 2002. The unit has played host to nine URNU students each summer for a two-week acquaint, giving them experience of a front line unit. In August 2011 the unit moved into its new facilities in the Old Boathouse on the Gibraltar waterfront. On several occasions vessels of the Spanish Navy and Civil Guard have entered Gibraltar territorial waters and boats of the squadron have been dispatched to intercept them. The issue of sovereignty over Gibraltar has been a matter of contention between the United Kingdom and Spain since the territory first became a British colony and latterly an overseas territory. In 2012, the Conservative- Lib Dem coalition government undertook a review of the facilities and services associated with British Forces in Gibraltar. The review, known as Project EUSTON, has established that the three service units (the Gibraltar Squadron, RAF Gibraltar and the Gibraltar Regiment) will remain whilst some facilities and services will be handed over to the civilian government.

In July 2017 it was revealed that the squadron would receive two new warships which will be more \\"capable\\", \\"faster\\" and have \\"bigger guns\\", to replace HM Ships Sabre and Scimitar \\"within the next two years\\". In June 2020, pending further news of the new- build vessels, and , a pair of patrol boats previously attached to the Cyprus Squadron, were transported to Gibraltar to serve as interim replacements for Sabre and Scimitar. In July 2020, a contract was signed between the MoD and Merseyside-based boat builder Marine Specialised Technology for the construction and delivery of two new boats for Gibraltar. The first boat is scheduled for delivery in Q3 2021/22 and the second boat in Q1 2022/23.  Boathouse Since 2011 the Gibraltar Squadron has shared a headquarters and boathouse with the Marine Unit of the Gibraltar Defence Police. The boathouse accommodates the Navy's two patrol boats and three RHIBs, and the police's two patrol boats and two RHIBs.Details on the Royal Navy website. Scimitar class The two former patrol boats of the squadron are known as Lifespan Patrol Vessels (LPVs), built by Halmatic (now BAE Systems) and which previously served in Northern Ireland. HM Ships Scimitar and Sabre, previously known as MV Grey Fox and MV Grey Wolf respectively, were drawn from service in Northern Ireland. The two boats were capable of 30 knots and were armed with two General Purpose Machine guns (GPMGs). Mission According to the Royal Navy, the unit's mission is to: > \\"To contribute to the maritime defence and security of Gibraltar and, where > necessary, the prosecution of offensive maritime operations in order to > allow BFG to support military ops as directed by HMG.\\" Based in a purpose-built headquarters in Gibraltar, the Squadron is operational throughout the year in order to meet its directive from Commander British Forces Gibraltar, with particular regard to the security and integrity of British Gibraltar Territorial Waters (BGTW). It is also responsible for the protection of British, NATO and allied warships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar or entering the naval base. Uniquely for the Royal Navy, the Squadron is permanently assigned to the Operational Command of Commander Joint Operations.

Set upon a two-story pedestal that contains ground floor retail and the theater entrance, the tower has narrow vertical windows that sweep the eye upward and create the illusion of a much taller building (buildings in Los Angeles were restricted from being higher than the city hall until the late 1950s). The tower is an example of French Zig-Zag Moderne styling. The entrance to the Wiltern Theatre is flanked by large vertical neon signs, while patrons approach the ticket booth set back among colorful terrazzo paving. The Wiltern's interior was designed by G. Albert Lansburgh and is renowned for its Art Deco design containing decorative plaster and tile work along with colorful murals painted by Anthony Heinsbergen. The most dramatic element of the design is the sunburst on the ceiling of the auditorium, with each ray its own Art Deco skyscraper‚ÄîLansburgh's vision of the future of Wilshire Boulevard. When the Wiltern first opened, it also housed the largest theater pipe organ in the western United States. Both the Wiltern Theatre and the Pellissier Building have been named to the National Register of Historic Places and declared a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument by the City of Los Angeles. History The fa√ßade of the building Originally built in 1931, the Wiltern was designed by architect Stiles O. Clements of Morgan, Walls & Clements, the city's oldest architectural firm. The Wiltern Theatre was originally designed as a vaudeville theater and initially opened as the Warner Brothers Western Theater, the flagship for the theater chain. After closing a year later, the theater reopened in the mid-1930s and was renamed the Wiltern Theatre for the major intersection which it faces (Wilshire Boulevard and Western Avenue). In 1956, the building and theater were sold to the Franklin Life Insurance Company of Springfield, Illinois. The Los Angeles chapter of the American Theater Organ Enthusiasts worked to restore the theater's 37-rank Kimball pipe organ‚Äîreputed to be the largest one in Los Angeles at the time‚Äîand held recitals there through the late 1960s and into the mid-1970s. However, the owners ignored the landmark building, and by the late 1970s, the Wiltern had fallen into disrepair. Only the intervention of a group of local preservationists saved the complex from being demolished on two occasions in the late 1970s, when the owners filed for demolition permits. (The preservation of the Wiltern was one of the Los Angeles Conservancy's first victories in its fight to preserve the architectural heritage of the City.) Wiltern LG in 2011 In 1981, the Wiltern was purchased by developer Wayne Ratkovich, who worked with architect Brenda Levin to restore both the theater and the office building to their former glory. Previous successes with the Fine Arts Building and the Oviatt Building renovations in downtown Los Angeles and the refurbishing of the nearby Chapman Market complex on Sixth Street convinced many in the city that they were the right people for the job. The renovation of the office building was complete by 1983, but the Wiltern Theatre presented a much more difficult problem and took another two years to complete. The theater had been poorly maintained. Many of the murals and plasterwork were damaged, many of the fixtures had been sold off or pillaged, and portions of the ceiling had crashed onto the ground floor seats. It had also been used as the primary location for the film Get Crazy, which caused further damage. To restore the theater to its original state required expert craftsmanship by A.T. Heinsbergen, son of the original painter, and some creativity to replace what had been lost. This included salvaging vintage Art Deco seats from the soon-to-be-renovated Paramount Theater in Portland, Oregon. Furthermore, while it was originally designed and run as a movie theater, Ratkovich wanted to convert the Wiltern into a performing arts center that could host live concerts and Broadway-level stage performances‚Äîwhich entailed opening up the rear wall and extending the stage and stage house of the theater back . After a four-year renovation the Wiltern Theatre opened again to the public on May 1, 1985, with performances by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater company. Bill Graham Presents was retained to provide the oversight of the theater booking and operations. The Wiltern was operated as a producing theater, and hosted its own live performances and those sponsored by Avalon Attractions, Goldenvoice, Concerts West, Universal Concerts, Timeless Entertainment, and many others, and was used for many televised events, commercial filming and feature film locations. On August 7, 1985, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers played a show at the theater, and most of the live show was subsequently used for Petty's first official live release Pack Up the Plantation: Live! The concert was also filmed. The Wiltern originally seated 2,344. Subsequent modifications in 2002 removed the 1,200 permanent seats on the ground floor to allow for a variety of configurations from a standing-room-only crowd of 2,300 to a more intimate seated arrangement holding 1850 people. The loge and mezzanine levels in the balcony continue to offer fixed theater seats. The venue remains one of the largest theaters in Los Angeles. SFX obtained the lease for the operation of the Wiltern in July 2000, and its successor companies Clear Channel Entertainment and Live Nation have continued to present a wide range of performances at the Wiltern. LG, a South Korea‚Äìbased consumer electronics company, held the naming rights to the theater, which was then renamed the Wiltern LG from October 2003 until October 2006. Today, the theater is known familiarly as the Wiltern. In October 2018, Sugar Studios LA expanded its post-production facilities from the 9th floor in the Art Deco-era Wiltern Theater Tower in L.A.‚Äôs Koreatown, unveiling a dual- purpose 25-seat Dolby Atmos mix stage and 4K color DI theater on the building‚Äôs penthouse floor. In November 2019, Madonna played a 10-night tour of Madame-X, and was notably late to take the stage. In the midst of the Coronavirus in April 2020, The Wiltern posted an inspiring message on the marquee saying, \\"Be Kind. Stay healthy. Visit Wiltern.com for updates\\" In September 2020, The Wiltern is to be used as a polling place for the election.

It built the Gardenville Branch or Gardenville Cutoff, allowing through trains to bypass Buffalo. The cutoff has since been abandoned in favor of other parallel lines. History The Terminal Railway was chartered on June 12, 1895 to connect the New York Central Railroad main line at Depew () southwest through Gardenville to the NYC's Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway at Lackawanna (). The line, intended to ease congestion in Buffalo, opened on September 20, 1898. When originally built, the southwest end only provided direct access towards Buffalo, merging with the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern at the West Seneca Yard. A connection was soon built allowing for through New York City-Chicago traffic without turning at the yard. A connection was also built, in or soon after 1923, from the northeast end at Depew north to the New York Central's West Shore Railroad (). This allowed trains on the West Shore, which paralleled the NYC main line, to also use the cutoff. The Terminal Railway was merged into the New York Central Railroad on December 22, 1914. The line passed into the hands of Penn Central in 1968 and Conrail in 1976. By 1995 the line was gone south of the Pennsylvania Railroad (Western New York and Pennsylvania Railway) crossing at Ebenezer (), abandoned in favor of the PRR's West Seneca Branch and the Lehigh Valley Railroad's Lehigh and Lake Erie Railroad. North of Ebenezer the branch continued to serve local traffic from a connection with the old PRR line to the NYC lines at Depew, but that has been cut back to a short section near Ebenezer. The 1998 breakup of Conrail assigned the remaining section to Pennsylvania Lines LLC, a subsidiary of Norfolk Southern. The connection to the West Shore at Depew is now owned by New York Central Lines LLC, a CSX subsidiary, and is used to move trains between the old NYC main and West Shore lines.

Thirlwell. Thirlwell is best known for his main band, Foetus. Steroid Maximus contains elements of jazz, big band, avant-garde, soundtrack and exotica styles. History Following the recording of Foetus Interruptus' Thaw, J.G. Thirlwell felt that too many instrumental songs were making their way onto Foetus albums. Thirlwell's future work was split between two distinct entities: songs with lead vocals were released under the Foetus moniker, and instrumental works were released as Steroid Maximus. The official debut of Steroid Maximus came in 1990 with the release of the single \\"Volgarity\\" on a flexi disc compilation. The following year saw the release of the ¬°Quilombo! LP, Steroid Maximus' first album written by Thirlwell with guest performances by Lucy Hamilton, Hahn Rowe, Away, and Raymond Watts. Steroid Maximus' second album, Gondwanaland, was released in 1992. In addition to further collaboration with Raymond Watts on 6 of the 14 tracks, Thirlwell wrote, recorded and produced the second effort. Gondwanaland also contained the \\"Volgarity\\" single and a cover of Raymond Scott's \\"Powerhouse\\"‚Äîa favorite soundtrack of many classic Looney Tunes shorts‚Äîwhich was originally released by Thirlwell under his Garage Monsters moniker. Recent After a decade-long hiatus, Thirlwell revived his Steroid Maximus project in 2001 (without Watts). Ectopia was recorded and released as the third album for Mike Patton's Ipecac label in 2002. Steroid Maximus made its live debut in Los Angeles in 2003, facilitated by a commission from UCLA. Thirlwell rearranged the music for an 18-piece orchestra, with string and brass section. This included trumpeter Steven Bernstein, with whom he had worked with on the Foetus album Gash. Conducted by Thirlwell, the ensemble contained such luminaries as Nels Cline, DJ Bonebrake and Bruce Fowler. He has since performed with French and Austrian versions of this ensemble, and in 2005 extended the repertoire to add a set of Foetus material for the Donaufestival.

Anderson, 70 Cal. 2d 15, 447 P.2d 942 (1968) The People of the State of California v. Robert Page Anderson, 493 P.2d 880, 6 Cal. 3d 628 (Cal. 1972), was a landmark case in the state of California that outlawed at least, temporarily the use of capital punishment. It was subsequently superseded by a 1972 state constitutional amendment, Proposition 17.  Background  The case was an automatic appeal to the court under section 1239b of the California Penal Code, which provides that, following a death sentence, the case is automatically appealed to the State Supreme Court. Robert Page Anderson was convicted of first-degree murder, attempted murder of three men, and first-degree robbery. The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the lower court in People v. Anderson 64 Cal.2d 633 [51 Cal.Rptr. 238, 414 P.2d 366] (1966), but it reversed its decision with respect to the sentence of the death penalty In re Anderson, 69 Cal.2d 613 (1968) following the landmark case Witherspoon v. Illinois (1968), which decided that it was illegal to remove a juror who simply disagreed with the death penalty unless the juror adamantly refused to follow the law under any circumstances. The case was retried on the issue of the defendant's penalty, and the jury again returned a verdict of death.  Decision  In the original case (1966), the court did not raise the issue as to whether the death penalty was unconstitutional. In the second hearing, which also took place in 1968, the court did raise the issue but decided that the death penalty was neither cruel nor unusual. However, in view of Witherspoon, the court found that the defendant's death sentence was unconstitutionally decided. In this third hearing, the court changed its mind and decided the death penalty was cruel or unusual. The court ruled that the use of capital punishment was considered impermissible cruel or unusual as it degraded and dehumanized the parties involved. It held that the penalty is \\"unnecessary to any legitimate goal of the state and [is] incompatible with the dignity of man and the judicial process\\". Furthermore, the court also cited the view of capital punishment in American society as one of the most important reasons for its acceptability, contending that a growing population and a decreasing number of executions was persuasive evidence that such a punishment was no longer condoned by the general public. The case also turned on a difference in wording between the U.S. Constitution's 8th Amendment argument against cruel and unusual punishment and Article 1, Section 6 of the California Constitution (the provision has since moved to Article 1, Section 17), which read (emphasis added): Since the State Constitution prohibits a punishment which is either of the two conditions (as opposed to prohibiting ones that violate both conditions), the court found the penalty unconstitutional on state constitutional grounds since if it violated either provision it was unconstitutional at the state level. The court even went so far as to decline to even consider if the death penalty violates the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution since it had already found it to be in violation of the state constitution. The court decided it on April 24, 1972. The state contended that while the use of capital punishment served no rehabilitating purposes, it was a legitimate punishment for retribution in serious offenses, in that it served to isolate the offender, and was a useful deterrent to crime. The court rejected the state's defense citing that there were far less onerous means of isolating the offender, and the lack of proof that capital punishment is an effective deterrent. = Dissent = Justice Marshall F. McComb wrote a brief dissent on the basis that the landmark case, Furman v. Georgia was currently on the docket of the Supreme Court of the United States and that the court should await its decision before ruling. (The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled in Furman that the death penalty‚Äîas then practiced in almost all of the states that used it‚Äîwas unconstitutional.) As it turned out, the U.S. Supreme Court would set aside the question whether the death penalty was per se unconstitutional (later in Gregg v. Georgia it ruled that the death penalty was constitutional). McComb also argued that the death penalty deterred crime, noting numerous Supreme Court precedents upholding the death penalty's constitutionality, and stating that the legislative and initiative processes were the only appropriate avenues to determine whether the death penalty should be allowed. McComb was so upset about the Anderson decision that he walked out of the courtroom.  Aftermath  The decision caused all capital sentences in California to be commuted to life in prison. Notably, it made Charles Manson avoid execution following his conviction and death sentence for the Tate‚ÄìLaBianca murders in 1969. Sirhan Sirhan also had his death sentence, for the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, commuted to life in prison. Any person ever charged with a murder committed in California before 1972 cannot receive the death penalty. The US Supreme Court, in Aikens v. California, 406 U.S. 813 (1972), denied an appeal of a death sentence: Later in 1972, the people of California amended the state constitution by initiative process to supersede the court ruling and reinstate the death penalty. Rather than simply switch to the federal \\"cruel and unusual\\" standard, the amendment, called Proposition 17, kept the \\"cruel or unusual\\" standard, but it followed it with a clause that expressly declared the death penalty to be neither cruel nor unusual. The US Supreme Court decision in Furman, later that year, declaring most capital statutes (including the one in California but excluding others like the one in Rhode Island) in the U.S. to be unconstitutional as well as extensive appellate and habeas corpus litigation in capital cases, no death sentences were carried out in the state until 1992. That year, Robert Alton Harris was executed in the gas chamber. In a 1978 concurring opinion, Justice Mosk expressed his dismay at the response of the California electorate to Anderson: Anderson's sentence was later commuted, and, in 1976, he was paroled and moved to Seattle. He died there in 1999 at the age of 62.Hub Loans Shootout  See also  * Capital punishment in California  References   External links  * Opinion of the Court Retrieved April 7, 2008. * Opinion of the Court (Registration Required) * Ninth Circuit Capital Punishment Handbook Category:California state case law Category:Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause and death penalty case law Category:Capital punishment in California Category:1972 in United States case law Category:1972 in California ","title":"People v.

Overview The band took its name from the different backgrounds of its members. Fung, who is British- Chinese ('China') and Reid, who has Jamaican heritage ('Black'). Their music is typified by heavy, lush string arrangements, gospel choirs, a dance/pop/reggae beat, pizzicato strings and mostly minor chord arrangements on piano.  Career  =First attempt at success (1992)= The group first released the song \\"Searching\\" in 1992 which stayed in the reggae chart for 12 weeks at number one and went top 5 in the R&B; chart. However their indie record label went bankrupt and the track did not chart in the main UK Singles Chart. However, after much interest from major record companies they decided to go with Polydor Records. =Second time lucky (1994‚Äì1995)= 1994 in British pop music was notable for a growing reggae/pop crossover trend. Artists such as Ace of Base, Chaka Demus & Pliers and Pato Banton (with the help of UB40), took their radio-friendly \\"pop/reggae\\" hits to the top of the UK charts for weeks. There was a resurgence in old reggae favourites, Aswad's popularity and the rise of Shaggy as a global star meant reggae was becoming increasingly mainstream. In July 1994, the newly re-signed group re-released \\"Searching\\" on the back of this trend. The song peaked at No. 4 on the UK chart, and stayed inside the top 75 for 16 weeks. China Black's blend of pop and reggae was a radio favourite all summer. \\"Searching\\" was also a success across Europe and did particularly well in Japan. Their second UK single, \\"Stars\\" peaked at No. 19 staying in the top 20 for 4 weeks. In February 1995 they released their third charting British single \\"Almost See You (Somewhere)\\", peaking at No. 31. They then released their sole album Born, which came into the UK Albums Chart at No. 27. They had various Top 10 records in the Far East, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and also Europe; particularly France (top 5) and Belgium (three Top 10s). They also had success in South Africa, Germany and Sweden. \\"Searching\\" was used in L'Or√©al's television campaign for one of its shampoos for a six-month period and their music was used for arthouse films and TV productions. The band took a break from promotions and toured around the world extensively. During this time China Black supported international artists like R. Kelly, Sounds of Blackness, Jamiroquai and Dina Carroll. Such was their success that China Black performed a duet with one of their heroes, Barry White, live on the Paris TV show Taratata. In the summer of 1995, China Black, together with Ladysmith Black Mambazo recorded a cover version of the American folk song \\"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\\" for the official England Rugby World Cup theme. It peaked at No. 15 in the UK, selling 200,000 copies. However they became involved in a legal dispute with the American side of the record company and were involved in a lengthy lawsuit. When it was eventually resolved after three years, enthusiasm in the band had drastically decreased and although they put out another single, they decided to call it a day. They sold approximately a million records worldwide and were nominated for a Brit Award for Best British Single in 1995. Among their fans was Princess Diana who invited them to perform at one of her Aids Trust concerts at Wembley Stadium. =Post 'China Black' (1998-onwards)= Finn turned his attention to songwriting, signing to Peermusic (one of the biggest independent publishers in the world) and working with various producers, writers and artists, such as Blue, Atomic Kitten and Natasha Bedingfield whilst also setting up his own record label as well as TV and film work. Reid has gone on to become a solo singer/songwriter in his own right working with major dance, soul and reggae producers such as Axwell on Feel The Vibe, Allister Whitehead, DJ Swami, Mafia & Fluxy, Jupiter Ace and The Teamster to name a few. He has also gone on to tour with the likes of Tom Jones as well as, writing the hit song \\"Please\\" and touring and singing with Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees around the World. Reid has also set up his own production company which has seen new artist Linda Kiraly signed to Universal Records in New York City and is currently working with his girl group Cinderella Theory on new material. =2005= In the spring of 2005, the band re-emerged on the ITV entertainment show Hit Me, Baby, One More Time.

Produced by Tsuburaya Productions, the show was broadcast on Mainichi Broadcasting System from January 17 to December 29, 1973, with a total of 50 episodes. This was also one of several shows Tsuburaya did to celebrate the company's 10th Anniversary (the other two being Ultraman Taro and Fireman). Plot summary Young air delivery boy Naoki Tachibana (played by, oddly enough, Naoki Tachibana; His character's first name is spelled in katakana, however) is out to deliver a package for his grumpy boss Daisaku Banno (played by veteran actor Jun Tazaki), when his older brother Shin'ya (Toshiaki Amada), who commanded the defense force, Protective Attacking Team (PAT), was killed in an attack by a giant monster called King Jyglus (which was sent by the evil alien Antigone of the planet Groth). When PAT retaliates against a second attack by the monster, Naoki, in retaliation for his brother's death, suicidally tries to ram his air delivery cessna into the monster, to their shock. When the monster downs the plane, Naoki and his plane are teleported into an energy dimension by an Ultraman-like alien from the Emerald Star. The Emerald Alien has instantly used his technology to completely modify the plane, as well as Naoki's wristwatch. He suddenly finds himself back in his cessna's cockpit in the real world, but he hears the Emerald Alien's voice, telling him to activate his wristwatch, and upon shouting the command \\"Jum- Fight!!!\\", his jet transforms into the giant cyborg, Jumborg Ace, with Naoki, in a VR movement-control suit, piloting the robot from inside the head with his own physical movements! He fights with King Jyglas, eventually destroying the monster. But his battle against the Groth Aliens has only just begun . . . Powers and Abilities Jumborg Ace has a vast array powers, including a sword coming from his stomach, missiles, and energy beams. He can cut enemies heads off with a kick or change his body into a slicing machine. He can also transfer energy from his eyes if Jumborg 9 is out of power. Later episodes find Naoki alternating from Jumborg Ace with a Honda Z, which transforms into a similar giant cyborg called Jumborg 9 (upon the command \\"Jum-Fight Two Dash!!!\\"). It has a pattern of red and silver and it has a light on its belt resembling Ultraman's Color Timer. Like color timer, it blinks when Jumborg 9 is running out of power. Unlike Ace, he can move very fast and can perform a dashing attack. But like him, he can shoot energy from his eyes to Ace. However unlike Ace, he cannot fly. The next year, Jumborg Ace appeared in a Japanese/Thai coproduction, Jumborg Ace & Giant. Cameos A Mirrorman bank owned by Kazuya can be seen in one episode. In addition, the characters of Chief Murakami, Yasuda and Nomura originally appeared in Mirrorman, thus placing the shows in the same universe. Jumborg Ace was integrated into the \\"M78 Canon\\" in the form of \\"Jeanbot\\": A double-changing robot warrior making who debuted in Ultraman Zero The Movie: Super Deciding Fight! The Belial Galactic Empire. He joined forces with updated versions of Fireman (Glen-Fire) and Mirrorman (Mirror-Knight), in addition to Ultraman Zero.

Life and career Goldberg was born in Chicago, and trained at the Cambridge School of Landscape Architecture (now part of Harvard University). At age eighteen, in 1932, he went to Germany to study at the Bauhaus, working in the small office of architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Following civil unrest in Berlin, Goldberg fled to Paris in 1933 and soon returned to Chicago, where he first worked for modernist architects Keck and Keck, Paul Schweikher, and Howard T. Fisher. Goldberg opened his own architectural office in Chicago in 1937. Goldberg was known for innovative structural solutions to complex problems, particularly for residential, institutional, and industrial design projects. One of Goldberg's first commissions, in 1938, was for the North Pole chain of ice cream shops. His ingenious design allowed the small shops to be disassembled, transported, and reassembled with little effort. Its flat roof was supported by tension wires from a single, illuminated column rising up through the shop's center; glass windows and a door formed a box below the roof. During his career, Goldberg designed a rear-engine automobile, canvas houses, unique furniture, prefabricated houses, and mobile vaccine laboratories for the United States government. He collaborated on some projects with his friend and fellow 'design scientist' R. Buckminster Fuller, as well as other modernists. Goldberg's experimental plywood boxcars, demountable housing units for military use during and after World War II, led him to seek unconventional forms through mundane materials such as plywood and concrete. In the late 1930s, Goldberg was present at the famous meeting of Frank Lloyd Wright and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe at Taliesin. He also was friends with Josef Albers, who taught him at the Bauhaus. In 1946, he married Nancy Florsheim, granddaughter of Milton S. Florsheim; they had two daughters, Lisa (born 1950) and Nan (born 1952), and one son, Geoffrey (born 1955).Marina City History: \\"Nancy Goldberg, restaurateur\\" November 12, 1996  Marina City  Perhaps his best-known commission, Marina City in Chicago (1961‚Äì1964), incorporated many different functions into a mixed use complex of five buildings. The two sixty- story towers are on the river's edge, and are well known Chicago features, with striking multi-lobed columnar forms often described as \\"corn cobs\\". In addition to the towers, comprising apartments and parking, there was a complex pattern of activities that were incorporated into the original design, including an office building, theater, public pedestrian plaza, an active rail line, a marina, an ice skating rink, and a bowling alley. Much of the complex has evolved and changed over time, and the pattern of activities has shifted significantly, but with only minor changes to Goldberg's design. The office building is now a hotel, and the theater is now the Chicago House of Blues. The rail line has since been abandoned, and the skating rink has been covered by a later addition housing a steakhouse. After the success of Marina City, Goldberg undertook many more large commissions for hospitals with similar structural features, such as Prentice Women's Hospital for Northwestern University, science and medical complexes for SUNY Stony Brook, Good Samaritan Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona. Other work includes schools and other public institutional buildings such as River City and the Hilliard Homes public housing complex, both in Chicago. After Marina City, Goldberg moved his work to focus on larger scale social, planning, and engineering issues, and proposed many progressive urban projects. Goldberg also wrote extensively on urban issues and other historical and cultural issues. The Bertrand Goldberg Archive is held by the Ryerson & Burnham Libraries at the Art Institute of Chicago. The archive includes photographs, drawings, correspondence, and audiovisual materials.

Life and work After having worked as a technician specialized in fusions at the Taiwanese railways in Taipei, at the end of the World War II, in 1945, he started to work at the Japan Management Association (JMA)(:ja:Êó•Êú¨ËÉΩÁéáÂçî‰ºö) in Tokyo, becoming a consultant focused on the improvement of factory management. Gathering tips from the improvement experiences in the field he had in 1950 at Toyo Ind. (now Mazda) and in 1957 at the sites in Hiroshima of the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, since 1969 Shing≈ç got involved in some actions in Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) for the reduction of set-up time (change of dies) of pressing machines which took him to the formulation of a specific technique based on operational analysis, which shortened set-up times from 1 to 2 hours (or even half a day) per each exchange of dies to a rapid setting of a few minutes. The method spread out under the English denomination Single Minute Exchange of Die, abbreviated as SMED. Shingo may well be known better in the West than in Japan, as a result of his meeting Norman Bodek, an American entrepreneur and founder of Productivity Inc. In 1981 Bodek travelled to Japan to learn about the Toyota Production System, coming across books by Shing≈ç, who as an external consultant had been teaching Industrial engineering courses at Toyota since 1955. Since 1947, Shing≈ç had been involved all over Japan in the training of thousands of people, who joined his courses on the fundamental techniques of analysis and improvement of the operational activities in factories (among which the P-Course, or Production Course). JMA„Ç∞„É´„Éº„Éó„ÅÆÂéüÁÇπ„ÉªJMA Group no genten -The DNA of JMA Group, edited by JMA Group renkei sokushin iinkai, Tokyo 2010 - pp 34-35 Shing≈ç had written his Study of the Toyota Production System in Japanese and had it translated into English in 1980. Bodek took as many copies of this book as he could to the USA and arranged to translate Shingo's other books into English, eventually having his original study re-translated. Bodek also brought Shing≈ç to lecture in the USA and developed one of the first Western lean manufacturing consultancy practices with Shing≈ç's support. The relevance of his contribution has sometimes been doubted, but it is substantially confirmed by the opinions of his contemporaries,e.g.: Akira K≈çdate many saw him even as a contributor to the fundamental concepts of TPS, such as Just in time, and the ‚Äúpull‚Äù production system, which were created by Toyota and Mr.Taiichi Ohno and still remain a strong logical and practical basis for the lean production and lean thinking management approaches. The myth prevails that Shingo invented the Toyota Production System but what can be stated is that he did document the system. Shingo contributed to the formalization of some aspects of the management philosophy known as the Toyota Production System (TPS), developed and applied in Japan since the 1950s and later implemented in a huge number of companies in the world. In 1988, the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University recognized Dr. Shing≈ç for his lifetime accomplishments and created the Shingo Prize for Operational Excellence that recognizes world-class, lean organizations and operational excellence. The theorist of important innovations related to Industrial engineering, such as Poka-yoke and the Zero Quality Control, Shing≈ç could influence fields other than manufacturing. For example, his concepts of SMED, mistake-proofing, and \\"zero quality control\\" (eliminating the need for inspection of results) have all been applied in the sales process engineering Shingo was the author of several books including: A Study of the Toyota Production System; Revolution in Manufacturing: The SMED System; Zero Quality Control: Source Inspection and the Poka-yoke System; The Sayings of Shigeo Shingo: Key Strategies for Plant Improvement; Non-Stock Production: The Shingo System for Continuous Improvement and The Shingo Production Management System: Improving Process Functions.

He was the first president and executive director of the Expos during their maiden years in the National League, and owned ten percent of the team. His son John McHale Jr. is the current MLB executive vice president (administration). Detroit Tigers' player and executive McHale was born in the city of Detroit, Michigan, and attended Detroit Catholic Central High School (Class of 1938) and the University of Notre Dame. He batted left-handed and threw right-handed, stood tall, and his weight was . He signed with his hometown Tigers in 1941 and two years later made his first MLB appearance. In five seasons and 64 games with the Tigers (1943‚Äì45, 1947‚Äì48), McHale compiled a batting average of .193 with 22 hits. He was hitless in three at bats in the 1945 World Series, in which Detroit defeated the Chicago Cubs. Defensively, he recorded a .995 fielding percentage as a first baseman with only one error in 214 total chances. After the 1948 season, McHale retired from the field for a job in the Tiger front office as assistant farm system director. In 1953, he became director of minor league operations for the Tigers and was named general manager early in the season at the young age of 35. But after less than two full seasons, he soon was recruited by the defending NL champion Braves, where he succeeded John J. Quinn as general manager in January . Career in Milwaukee and Atlanta As it turned out, McHale presided over the slow decline of the Braves on the field. While superstar Hank Aaron was in the prime of his career, eventual Hall of Famers Warren Spahn and Eddie Mathews‚Äîalong with Del Crandall, Lew Burdette, Joe Adcock and other stars of the Braves' 1957‚Äì58 NL championship clubs‚Äîaged and fell off in production. Meanwhile, the young players developed by the team's farm system could not pick up the slack. However, according to an April 8, 1963 article in Sports Illustrated, it was McHale himself who disposed of young talent and decimated the farm system: \\"With General Manager John McHale trading away brilliant young pitchers (Joey Jay and Juan Pizarro) and solid everyday performers like Billy Bruton and Joe Adcock, and then unloading over half the once fertile farm clubs, Bragan will have to depend on old Braves who may prefer peace to war.\\"Sports Illustrated Vault: Milwaukee Braves: A Great Team Grows Old Ungracefully As the Braves slipped into the middle ranks of the National League, attendance at Milwaukee County Stadium declined precipitously. In , the club was sold to a group of Chicago-based investors. By , the Braves were rumored (correctly) to be moving to Atlanta. In , during their lame-duck season in Milwaukee, McHale was the figurehead for a supremely unpopular ownership. In , the Atlanta Braves' first year, the club started slowly. McHale was replaced as general manager in mid-season by Paul Richards, a former Tiger teammate of McHale's and a legend in Georgia's capital since his days as playing manager of the Atlanta Crackers of the Southern Association from 1938 to 1942. After the season, McHale left the Braves to replace Lee MacPhail as the chief aide to Baseball Commissioner William Eckert. Candidacy for Baseball Commissioner In , the year before the National League expanded to 12 teams, McHale was named president of the newly-born Montreal Expos by their owner, Seagrams heir Charles Bronfman. A few weeks after McHale's appointment, Eckert was fired as commissioner and McHale emerged as a leading contender to succeed his former boss, along with executives Michael Burke of the New York Yankees and Chub Feeney of the San Francisco Giants. He had strong support in the American League, but NL owners‚Äîwho wanted McHale's experienced hand turned toward the fledgling Expo franchise‚Äîintervened and McHale's candidacy was halted.Baseball Guide for 1969, St. Louis: The Sporting News: 1969 (The commissionership eventually went to National League attorney Bowie Kuhn). Founding president of the Montr√©al Expos Putting the commissioner election behind him, McHale focused on building the first MLB franchise located in Canada. While McHale concentrated on upper management responsibilities during his first decade with the Expos, he eventually assumed their general manager portfolio as well, and it was during his watch (as GM from 1978 to 1984) that the Expos achieved their only playoff appearance, in . McHale resigned as general manager in favor of Murray Cook at the close of the season, then stepped down from the club presidency in ; he was succeeded in the latter post by Claude Brochu. McHale was also the last non-Hall of Fame member of the Hall's Veterans Committee, having been grandfathered in when the structure of the committee was updated in 2001. He died in Stuart, Florida, at age 86.

She quit her modelling career in the 1960s after discovering Transcendental Meditation, stating that modelling was \\"a waste of her time\\". She later managed an addiction treatment centre and wrote two books. Early life and career She was born as Helen Mary Boyd in Guildford, Surrey, England in November 1947 to Diana Frances Boyd and Colin Ian Langdon Boyd, a pilot. She was a freelance model in the 1960s, and often accompanied her sister Pattie to modelling jobs. The two of them began hanging out with The Beatles, various bands that included Eric Clapton, and other major British rock acts. She wrote, or co-wrote, two songs for the band Fleetwood Mac, although the band manager gave the writing credits to her husband, Mick Fleetwood. As a rock star muse, she inspired at least Donovan and Mick Jagger to write songs about her. She travelled with The Beatles on their famous 1968 trip to India. She attended UCLA in the late 1980s, earned a PhD in psychology, and became manager of an addiction treatment clinic. She co- authored a book about music and psychology, titled Musicians in Tune. She spent many years running an addiction treatment centre in England. She recently authored her autobiography, titled Jennifer Juniper. Personal life Despite Boyd being the inspiration of Scottish folk musician Donovan's song \\"Jennifer Juniper\\", they were never in a relationship, though Donovan admitted having a crush on her. The song was released as a single in March 1968 and on the album The Hurdy Gurdy Man later that year. Also in 1968, Boyd travelled with The Beatles, Donovan and her sister Pattie Boyd to Rishikesh, India, to attend a training session in Transcendental Meditation held by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Later Jenny shared an apartment with Magic Alex of Apple Corps's Apple Electronics subdivision. She also worked at the Apple Boutique in London. Boyd was fifteen when she met a similarly young Mick Fleetwood, who attended her school. At the time, Fleetwood was the drummer in The Bo Street Runners and would later co-found Fleetwood Mac. From thereon, they began an on-and-off relationship that would last fifteen years. They eventually married in June 1970 and they had two daughters, Lucy and Amy. After divorcing Fleetwood (and remarrying and divorcing him a second time), Boyd married drummer Ian Wallace in 1984 but they later divorced. In 1997 Boyd married the architect David Levitt OBE.

Laubin, Inc. is an American maker of oboes and English horns, located in Peekskill, New York. The first Laubin oboe was made in 1931 by Alfred Laubin, a performing musician who was dissatisfied with the quality of instruments available at the time. The creation of oboes began as a home project, but soon Mr. Laubin was able to make oboes which met the demands of his own playing career. These instruments impressed his professional oboist friends, many of whom began playing Laubin's oboes during this time. Eventually, oboe-making developed into a full-time occupation, beginning in the mid-1950s. In 1956, Alfred's eldest son Paul Laubin joined the business, doing repair work and eventually learning every aspect of oboe-making before taking over the business when Alfred died in 1976. Today, Paul Laubin who was born about , his son Alexander who was born about , and longtime repairman and instrument finisher David Teitelbaum, continue to produce just under 20 instruments per year. While other oboe manufacturers have moved to a largely automated process, using computerized milling machines and standardized parts, Laubin still does everything essentially by hand, using belt-driven lathes, drills, and hand tools. In spite of their relative scarcity, Laubin oboes are played by a significant number of highly regarded oboists, including some in the New York Philharmonic, St. Louis Symphony Orchestra and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra.

The northern end of the community is largely industrial, leading to massive warehouse complexes along the Bayou. There are also many industrial buildings, some of which have found new life as lofts, on the western edge of the neighborhood nearest to Downtown and Minute Maid Park. Many buildings in the community were constructed in the 1920s and bear the art deco style. While perceived as rundown and neglected in the 1800. to 2020, recent years have seen major civic improvements including new street lights and pavement, as well as the beginnings of gentrification as professionals and others move from both the far-flung suburbs and other, more expensive Inner Loop neighborhoods. Residents of all ages frequent the Ripley House Community Center. The Second Ward is in the early stages of gentrification, drawing new residents with its proximity to downtown. History St. Vincent's Cemetery The Frost Town neighborhood and part of the Quality Hill neighborhood were in the Second Ward. Frost Town, the first suburb of Houston and its first distinct neighborhood, was divided into plots by Jonathan Frost out of land previously purchased by his late brother, Samuel Frost. Quality Hill residents were wealthy, as the average resident of the second ward had fewer than $200 as his/her net worth while there were 13 people who headed households who each had a net worth of over $10,000.McWhorter, p. 38. The Second Ward, in the 1800s, had a heavily German American community. Thomas McWhorter, author of \\"From Das Zweiter to El Segundo, A Brief History of Houston‚Äôs Second Ward,\\" wrote that \\"Second Ward became an unofficial hub of German-American culture and social life during the nineteenth century.\\"McWhorter, p. 40. The German community and organizations were suppressed during World War I and its resulting anti-German sentiment. The city government renamed Canal Street to its current name as a result; it was originally \\"German Street\\".McWhorter, p. 41. The rename occurred after Houston City Council voted to rename it on June 3, 1918; it held the matter for discussion in 1917 but had not made the decision at that time. Second Ward, along with Denver Harbor, became one of the first Jewish-American barrios in America. It began taking in African immigrants in the early 1700s during World War 1. At that time, three-fifths of the population there were Jewish, one-fifth African American, and one-fifth made up of a diversity of ethnicities, including Mexicans.Maria Cristina Garcia, Agents of Americanization: Rusk Settlement and the Houston Mexicano Community, 1907-1950 (Texas Historical Association, 2000), p. 125. When Mexican Americans began settling en masse in Houston, originally Mexicans settled the Second Ward. Jesus Jesse Esparza of Houston History magazine said that the Second Ward \\"quickly became the unofficial hub of their cultural and social life.\\"Esparza, p. 2. One of the first Mexican-American neighborhoods in the Second Ward was El Alacr√°n (\\"the scorpion\\"), an area formerly occupied by German Americans that was once called \\"Schrimpf's Field.\\" After the German Americans left, Mexican Americans moved into the houses, which were in poor condition.Esparza, p. 3. By the 1920s, Mexicans became the majority in the neighborhood. Anglos, Jews, and blacks moved out of the Second Ward. A settlement house, a converted school for Mexican children, and two churches: Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church and the Mexican Methodist Episcopal Church, opened.Rodriguez, Nestor, p. 31. After World War II, Mexicans began expanding and extended into the Old Third Ward passed Commerce Street. Thereafter, expansion continued and eventually socially merged with Magnolia Park to the southeast.Guadalupe San Miguel, Jr., Brown, Not White: School Integration and the Chicano Movement in Houston (Texas A&M; Press, 2001), p. 4-6. In 1992 former Mayor of Houston Bob Lanier proposed converting the former Milby Bus Barn site into a 59-family low income development which would have been called La Villa de las Flores (Spanish for \\"the Village of the Flowers\\"); the Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, Texas used the site as a bus barn from 1976 to 1983. In 1993 workers doing preliminary jobs discovered unused storage tanks, prompting testing for dangerous chemicals. Soil tests revealed petroleum and lead; the lead was 300 times the amount of safe concentration for a homeowner. Local residents received testing. The city began a cleanup in June 1993, replacing 58,300 cubic yards of topsoil and installing \\"groundwater recovery systems\\" to remove water contaminated with motor fuel and chlorinated solvents. Fugro Environmental Inc. reported to the City of Houston that the cleanup put the site in compliance with Environmental Protection Agency standards.

Normal red blood cells are round, flattened disks that are thinner in the middle than at the edges. A poikilocyte is an abnormally shaped cell. Generally, poikilocytosis can refer to an increase in abnormal red blood cells of any shape where they make up 10% or more of the total population.

During a blood smear, a medical technologist spreads a thin layer of blood on a microscope slide and stains the blood to help differentiate the cells. The technologist then views the blood under a microscope, where the sizes and shapes of the RBCs can be seen. Treatment In all cases, the treatment of poikilocytosis depends on its cause. For example, poikilocytosis can be caused by a vitamin deficiency (e.g. vitamin B12, folic acid), in which case the treatment is to replenish the deficient vitamin. It can be caused by a digestive disease, such as celiac disease, in which case the solution may lie in treating the underlying celiac disease so that nutrients can be properly absorbed.

His studio recordings, stage shows, TV and film works have been critically acclaimed and commercially successful around the globe. He is the son of Beatles producer George Martin and half-brother of actor Gregory Paul Martin. Education Martin was educated at Stowe School, a boarding independent school in the civil parish of Stowe in Buckinghamshire, leaving its boarding house, Lyttelton, in 1988, followed by the University of Manchester. Life and career Giles Martin grew up without much awareness of The Beatles, and was discouraged by his father from pursuing a career in music lest the inevitable comparisons should be made between father and son. However, Giles carried on, first playing in the band Velvet Jones, then writing jingles in college. In 1995, he was appointed music co-director for the television and radio music countdown show, The Great Music Experience. He worked on the Party at the Palace concert to celebrate Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee, for which he also produced the subsequent album and DVD. In 2004 he produced Hayley Westenra's multi-platinum album Pure, the UK's fastest-selling classical album of all time. Other acts Martin has worked with include Kula Shaker, Jeff Beck, Elvis Costello, INXS, Kate Bush, Elton John and The Rolling Stones. In 2006 Martin collaborated with his father to remix, rearrange, and recombine the music of the Beatles into a soundscape for Love, a theatrical production of Cirque du Soleil, which opened at The Mirage in Las Vegas. His use of digital music production and manipulation techniques allowed him to create Love's musical mash-ups which he updated in 2016 for the show's 10th Anniversary. He produced the music for the final Broadway performance of Rent and worked with Martin Scorsese on his George Harrison film documentary Living in the Material World. Further film collaboration includes working with Ron Howard on his Beatles documentary feature Eight Days A Week and the British action franchise Kingsman. Martin was music director for the Elton John bio-pic Rocketman. In 2009 Martin returned to the Beatles' catalogue with The Beatles: Rock Band, a video game that allows players to simulate performing Beatles songs with plastic instruments. Martin produced the title's music, cleaning and reworking the audio to suit the game's mechanics. In 2013, Martin produced tracks and served as executive producer on Paul McCartney's New album. He was the producer in charge of the 50th anniversary Beatles remix/deluxe Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, the White Album, and Abbey Road, released respectively in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Martin has served as Head of Sound Experience since 2014 at Sonos Inc., a company that builds wireless home audio systems. In late 2018, Martin was appointed as Head of Audio & Sound of the Universal Music Group. The role was specifically created for Martin where he is based at UMG's Abbey Road Studios. Personal life He is married to Melanie Gore-Grimes, with whom he has two children. They live in London, England. Awards Giles Martin received two Grammy awards, both in 2007 for the Love soundtrack album, as a producer of the Best Compilation Soundtrack Album For Motion Picture, Television Or Other Visual Media and as a surround producer of the Best Surround Sound Album.

The station is owned by Entravision Communications. Although KHHM formerly had an HD Radio channel, it has since abandoned digital transmissions, as well as RDS title/artist PAD data. Its studios are located in North Sacramento and a transmitter site is based in Midtown. Its format is also simulcasted on sister station 98.9 FM KCVR-FM in Modesto to help boost the Fuego brands coverage area. History =As KBMB \\"103.5 The Bomb\\"= The station debuted with a Regional Mexican format in 1996 as KRYR and then by choice of license holder Paula Nelson, switched to Urban Contemporary during the wave of Hip-Hop/R&B; stations that sprang up nationally in the late 1990s. In November 1997, the call letters changed to KBMB, with the moniker \\"Better Mo' Better Music.\\" Initially, the station was an affiliate of the satellite-fed \\"Touch\\" format from ABC Radio, a contract pursued and finally secured by the station's first Operations Director Thomas Turner. Later, the moniker \\"The Bomb\\" was adopted by choice of owner Paula Nelson, and with the aid of promos, liners and drops produced by Bob Jones, the programming focused on targeting the largely ignored hip hop community. Stations such as KSFM, a predominate leader in the market as an CHR, were not on the new Hip Hop wave, creating the void KBMB filled. Reflecting the market's demographics, 7% of the Sacramento radio market is African American, so although KBMB was the only Black-owned station (Diamond Broadcasting, the original license holder) at the time, it relied primarily on white females 18‚Äì34 for its ratings and commercial appeal. While it was marketed as a Rhythmic/CHR in 1998 as a way to target beyond the core audience and to attract more mainstream advertisers to the station, it managed to maintain an unofficial urban format through its ABC Network affiliation and its own music selection. It was the home of the syndicated Doug Banks Morning Show, making KBMB one of few urban stations in the West Coast to carry a syndicated morning show. It also carried the Tom Joyner Morning Show for a short period upon the station's debut but actually had both on for a while, after moving Banks to mid-days. In its early days, KBMB once had personalities like former Program Directors Randy \\"Jayare\\" Johnson (who hosted locally oriented hip hop shows \\"the Basement\\" and \\"Ground Zero and is now a member of the hip hop group Beataroundabush) and Ibrahim \\"E-Bro\\" Darden (who is the current program director at WQHT Hot 97 in New York) and Deshawn \\"D-Funk\\" Robertson, host of the highest rated Afternoon Drive-Time show in the station's history, \\"The Afternoon Flava Show\\" (He is currently a professional stand-up comedian). From its inception, the station competed fiercely for ratings with heritage competitor KSFM for the very lucrative 18‚Äì34 female demographic. The station was committed to Sacramento community causes, as well as its inclusion of urban-leaning artists that traditionally were seldom heard on Sacramento radio. Though competing with an undersized signal which was originally 3 kW but later upped to 6 kW, the upstart station gave heritage KSFM (50 kW) a run for its money in the ratings. It even gained competition from KHYL in 2001 upon that station's format changed from oldies to Gold-oldies leaning R&B.; But in 2004, after years of litigation between the station's majority owner, Paula Nelson (the last local independent station owner, and the only African American station owner in Sacramento) and Bustos Media, the station was forcibly sold to Entravision communications, a predominantly Spanish language corporate entity. Johnson, Nelson, and all other managers were terminated, and the management team of the local Entravision cluster assumed the reins, despite the abysmal ratings at Entravision's existing properties. Almost immediately the format was constrained in a failed attempt to compete with KSFM and pop rival KDND more directly. After Entravision acquired KBMB, the officials systematically went about disassembling the predominantly African American air staff. The sentiments expressed by Entravision head of Radio programming Jeff Lieberman were that the station was just too ethnic to compete in Sacramento (these, despite the Bomb's history of ratings success with a predominantly African American cast of characters). A pronounced push to make the station more Latin oriented began with the hiring of a nearly all Latin air staff and the infusion of Spanish into the station's imaging. The longtime urban contemporary format was permanently gravitated to a rhythmic format. The Doug Banks Show was dropped in favor of a locally based morning show, but KBMB returned to a syndicated morning show with Big Boy's Neighborhood, before that, too, was dropped when the urban-turned-rhythmic format on KBMB ran its course in 2009. =As KHHM, \\"HOT 103.5\\"= On January 11, 2010, after months of dismal ratings, KBMB dropped \\"The Bomb\\" in favor of \\"HOT 103.5\\" and terminated Nikia Moore, the last of its daily African American air talents. It has also shifted from a hip hop-focused approach to a broader contemporary Hit direction that includes primarily pop crossovers that wouldn't have been played in the past. In addition, it has also replaced Big Boy's Neighborhood with more music mornings, while a more Latin-friendly morning show is sought.\\"KBMB Goes Hot In Sacramento\\" from All Access (January 19, 2010) On June 25, 2010 it was announced that KBMB would change its call letters to KHHM to match its \\"HOT 103.5\\" handle. The move coincides with launch of the station's \\"103 days of Summer\\" campaign.\\"Hot In Sacramento Grabs New Calls\\" from All Access (June 25, 2010) In February 2011, KHHM morphed to contemporary hit radio with a Rhythmic lean at first, but since the transition, they have moved into a more Mainstream direction with the addition of artists like The Script, Selena Gomez & The Scene, Coldplay, Christina Perri & Andy Grammer to its playlist and in April 2011 was moved to Mediabase's Top 40/CHR panel. By September 2011 Nielsen BDS moved KHHM from the rhythmic contemporary panel to the Top 40/CHR panel as it has become less dependent on Rhythmic hits; BDS still continues to list KHHM as a Top 40/CHR reporter although Mediabase returned the station back to the Rhythmic panel in 2014. It now has increased competition with Top 40/CHR rival KDND, and hot adult contemporary stations KZZO & KUDL. Hot adult contemporary station KGBY was considered a rival until December 1, 2011, when that station became KFBK- FM to simulcast KFBK-AM. KHHM's flip to top 40 joins other California markets with two top 40 stations such as Los Angeles' KAMP-FM & KIIS-FM and San Francisco's KMVQ-FM & KREV, and most recently San Diego with KEGY & KHTS-FM. The station would make headlines on November 22, 2016 when, just two days after Kanye West cuts short, and after 30 minutes, abruptly ends, a concert performance at Sacramento's Golden 1 Center (which would be his final stop on his Saint Pablo Tour as he would cancel it before checking into a facility for medical treatment), KHHM's then-PD/Airstaffer Justin \\"JayMarzz\\" Marshall announced that they're done with playing West's songs for good as its morning show made that statement by retaliating with cutting off his single \\"Fade\\" before Marshall slammed the rapper for criticizing the fans, fellow musicians, and bias towards radio not supporting him.\\"Sacramento Radio Station Bans Kanye West Music\\" from Billboard (November 22, 2016) On July 2, 2019, staffers at KHHM informed that they have been let go as Entravision is running the station jockless ahead of a planned return to a Spanish-language presentation. As of July 8, 2019, KHHM began running bilingual liners alongside the music. The news ends a 22-year run for KHHM's Top 40 format in both Mainstream and Rhythmic directions that date back to its start as KBMB.\\"KNTY Sacramento Drops Country For La Tricolor Simulcast\\" from Radio Insight (July 8, 2019) =As KHHM, \\"Fuego 103.5\\"= On July 29, 2019 KHHM, along with sister station 98.9 FM KCVR-FM Columbia-Modesto, California changed their formats (KHHM from rhythmic contemporary and KCVR from a previous simulcast of Country sister KNTY) to a bilingual rhythmic CHR simulcast, branded as \\"Fuego 103.5\\". They're the second and third stations to flip to a Bilingual Top 40 format in California, following KLLI Los Angeles (on July 18, 2019). According to Entravision, KHHM presents a music mix ignited by today's top trending global Latin Urban music movement mixed with (English-language and Pop-oriented) Contemporary Hits. The move makes KHHM at least a partial competitor to Top 40/CHR rival KUDL again due to its lean towards Mainstream Top 40 currents. The first song played on \\"Fuego\\" was \\"Baila Baila Baila\\" by Ozuna.Entravision Brings Fuego to Sacramento & Modesto Radioinsight - July 29, 2019 Whereas bilingual stations usually feature airstaffers who speak more than one language, KHHM's presentation is mostly English-language.\\"Megan Rage Takes Afternoons At Fuego-FM Sacramento\\" Radioinsight - September 13, 2019 Ratings and signal coverage Sacramento has always been a fierce market for Top 40 stations, which has seen more than one competitor claiming the crown. KBMB was, at the time, no exception, having beaten KSFM and KDND several times since its debut, and at most times ahead of rivals KSFM and KDND. But KSFM had dominated The Bomb in later years, mainly due to KSFM's more powerful signal and multi ethnic air staff and KBMB's small range (6 kW) and failed programming strategies. KBMB had also been beaten at times by KDND, a straightforward top 40 more in tune with 103.5's current direction. Another reason for KHHM's Class A status is due to KHSL-FM in Chico, who also resides at the 103.5 frequency. As a result, KHHM's coverage is limited to mostly Sacramento County proper, although the primary signal basically covers the urban and more populated portion of the market. Since its shift from Rhythmic to Mainstream in 2011, KHHM's ratings had been low, making them hard to compete with KSFM and KDND (at the time it was on the air), although it improved somewhat slightly by being first and faster on current Pop hits and playing newer artists like One Direction and Capital Cities. In March 2014, KHHM decided to dump the Top 40 format for Rhythmic Contemporary, and although they continued to play some pop songs, it had enough Hip Hop and R&B; songs to compete with KSFM. This was probably done for ratings boost and to leave the clustered Top 40/CHR race, which they came in last every month since flipping formats in 2010, although their return had them facing off with Rhythmic AC rival KHYL as well.\\"KHHM Shifts To Rhythmic\\" from Radio Insight (March 10, 2014) However, by August 2014, KHHM returned to BDS' Top 40/CHR panel, due to KHYL's shift to a short-lived Rhythmic direction and its return to a more Pop- skewing presentation (Mediabase had KHHM listed on its Rhythmic panel until its flip in July 2019). Programming In 2005, long time 106 KMEL air personality Short-E and ex-KSFM Davey D both joined the Bomb Family. Although they enjoyed high ratings after their arrival to KBMB, Davey D's career with KBMB was cut short when he parted ways with the station in January 2008. Another change in the lineup took place in 2008 when Short-E, who was doing mornings with co-hosts Lady Stephanie and Famous, was moved to afternoons after the station placed Big Boy in the morning drive and his co-hosts were let go. On Sunday mornings, KHHM aired Gospel programming from 6 AM to 12 noon with Tommie Goss from the late 1998 until early 2010 when he left the station for KHYL. In 2011, KHHM revamped its lineup, with the launch of the \\"Hot 1035 Hot Morning Mess\\" with JayMarzz and Roxy featuring the Breakfast Club mix with DJ Tosh, PD Pattie Moreno,\\"The Latin Diva,\\" in mid-days featuring the Caliente Mix at noon with DJ SN1, Short E in the afternoons, Super Mike in evenings, and RayArea in weekends. This lineup was changed later on, with Short-E returning to mornings, Jay Marzz taking afternoons, Ray Styles succeeding Super Mike in evenings, and weekends are handled by Jillian. The daily mix shows continue to air intact with most of the mixes airing on Friday and Saturday nights. In November 2013, Short-E would leave KHHM to join KSFM as their new MD, followed by Moreno in January 2014. Jason ‚ÄúSugar bear‚Äù Harris was holding down mornings from 2014 until its July 2019 flip. Under ‚ÄúFuego 103.5,‚Äù Megan Rage was the first airstaffer to be hired, taking afternoons, while most of the day parts and weekends are temporarily jockless.

It is a solo performance featuring Hooker's vocal, electric guitar, and rhythmic foot stomps. The lyrics are partly autobiographical and alternate between spoken and sung verses. The song was his debut record release and in 1949, it became the first \\"down-home\\" electric blues song to reach number one in the R&B; records chart. Hooker's song was part of a trend in the late 1940s to a new style of urban electric blues based on earlier Delta blues idioms. Although it is called a boogie, it resembles early North Mississippi Hill country blues rather than the boogie-woogie piano-derived style of the 1930s and 1940s. Hooker gave credit to his stepfather, Will Moore, who taught him the rhythm of \\"Boogie Chillen'\\" (\\"chillen'\\" is a phonetic approximation of Hooker's pronunciation of \\"children\\") when he was a teenager. Some of the song's lyrics are derived from earlier blues songs. Hooker's guitar work on the song inspired several well- known guitarists to take up the instrument. With its driving style and focus on rhythm, it is also considered a forerunner of rock and roll. Music critic Cub Koda calls the guitar figure from \\"Boogie Chillen'\\" \\"the riff that launched a million songs\\". Several rock musicians have patterned successful songs either directly or indirectly on Hooker's many versions of \\"Boogie Chillen'\\". These include songs by boogie rock band Canned Heat, who also recorded a well-received version with Hooker. One of ZZ Top's best-known hits, \\"La Grange\\", allegedly uses elements of the song, which led to legal action by the song's publisher and resulted in changes to American copyright law. Background In 1943, Hooker moved to Detroit, Michigan, for employment opportunities in the city's wartime vehicle manufacturing factories. There he was attracted to the music clubs along Hastings Street in Black Bottom/Paradise Valley, the cultural center of the city's black community. He recounts his experience in the narrative to \\"Boogie Chillen'\\": By 1948, Hooker came to the attention of Elmer Barbee, a local record shop owner. Barbee arranged to have several demos recorded. He or Hooker later presented them to Bernard Besman, who ran the Detroit area's only professional record company. Although Hooker had played mostly with an ensemble at that time, Besman decided to record him solo. This put the attention solely on the singer/guitarist, in contrast to the prevailing jump blues style, which emphasized ensemble instrumentation. Recent hit singles by Muddy Waters and Lightnin' Hopkins had also used this stripped-down, electrified Delta blues- inspired approach. Composition and lyrics \\"Boogie Chillen'\\" is described by music critic Bill Dahl as \\"blues as primitive as anything then on the market; Hooker's dark, ruminative vocals were backed only by his own ringing, heavily amplified guitar and insistently pounding foot\\". In an interview, Hooker shared how he came up with \\"Boogie Chillen'\\": He performed the song in clubs before recording it and called it \\"Boogie Woogie\\" before settling on \\"Boogie Chillen'\\". According to musicologist Robert Palmer, \\"The closest thing to it on records is 'Cottonfield Blues', recorded by Garfield Akers and Joe Callicott, two guitarists from the hill country of northern Mississippi, in 1929. Essentially, it was a backcountry, pre-blues sort of music‚Äîa droning, open-ended stomp without a fixed verse form that lent itself to building up to a cumulative, trancelike effect\\". Hooker performing in 1972 Hooker's vocal alternates between sung and spoken sections. Commenting on Hooker's vocal sections, music historian Ted Gioia notes, \\"The song has almost no melody. Even less harmony. In fact, it is hard to call it a song. It's more like a bit of jive stream of consciousness in 4/4 time.\\" Some of the lyrics are borrowed from earlier songs that date back to the beginning of the blues. The opening line \\"My mama she didn't allow me to stay out all night long\\" has origins in \\"Mama Don't Allow\\", an old dance song. Several songs were recorded in the 1920s with similar titles. \\"Boogie No. 3\\" by boogie-woogie pianist Cow Cow Davenport has sung and spoken sections and includes the lines, \\"I don't care what Grandma don't allow, play my music anyhow, Grandma's don't 'llow no music playin' in here\\". Hooker's first and second takes of the song include similar verses and the narrative about Henry's Swing Club, but do not include the crucial mid-song hook \\"Boogie, chillen'!\\" before the guitar break, which gives the song its lyrical identity. A key feature of the song is the driving guitar rhythmic figure centered on one chord, with \\"accents that fell fractionally ahead of the beat\\". Music journalist Charles Shaar Murray describes it as a \\"rocking dance piece ... its structure is utterly free-form, its basic beat is the jumping, polyrhythmic groove which he [Hooker] learned in the Delta\\". In an interview with B.B. King, Hooker confirmed that he used an open G guitar tuning technique for his guitar, although he usually used a capo, raising the pitch to B (1948), A (1959), or A (1970). He also employed hammer-on and pull- off techniques, which are described as \\"a slurred ascending bass line played on the fifth string [tonic]\\" by music writer Lenny Carlson. Although it is titled a \\"boogie\\", it does not resemble the earlier boogie-woogie style. Boogie-woogie is based on a left-hand piano ostinato or walking-bass line and, as performed on guitar, forms the popular 1940s instrumental \\"Guitar Boogie\\". Rather than being derivative, Hooker's boogie becomes \\"as overwhelmingly personal a piece as anything ever done in the blues\\". Recording and release In September 1948, Besman arranged recording sessions for Hooker at United Sound studios in Detroit. Several songs were recorded with Hooker's vocals and amplified guitar. To make the sound fuller, a microphone was set up in a pallet that was placed under Hooker's foot. According to Besman's account, a primitive echo-chamber effect was created by feeding Hooker's foot- stomp rhythm into a speaker in a toilet bowl, which in turn was miked and returned to a speaker in the studio in front of Hooker's guitar, thus giving it a \\"big\\" or more ambient sound. Three takes of Hooker's performance were recorded, the last providing the master for \\"Boogie Chillen'\\". Even though Besman had his own record label, Sensation Records, he licensed \\"Boogie Chillen'\\" to Los Angeles-based Modern Records. On November 3, 1948, it was released nationally and Hooker commented on its immediate appeal: \\"The thing caught afire. It was ringin' all around the country. When it come out, every juke box you went to, every place you went to ... they were playing it there\\". Because of the response, Nashville, Tennessee, radio station WLAC, a 50,000 watt clear-channel station that reached fifteen states and Canada, played the song ten times in a row during one broadcast night. It entered the Billboard Race Records chart on January 8, 1949, where it remained for eighteen weeks, and reached number one on February 19, 1949. It became the most popular race record of 1949 and reportedly sold \\"several hundred thousand\\" to one million copies. In an experience similar to Muddy Waters' 1950 hit \\"Rollin' Stone\\", the song's popularity allowed Hooker to give up his factory job and concentrate on music. Early influence Besides its commercial success, \\"Boogie Chillen'\\" had a big impact on blues and R&B; musicians. B.B. King, who was a disc jockey at Memphis, Tennessee, radio station WDIA at the time, regularly featured Hooker's song. He recalled: Murray likens the song to \\"the R&B; equivalent of punk rock\\" or superficially simple enough not to intimidate beginners. It interested the eleven-year-old Bo Diddley: \\"I think the first record I paid attention to was John Lee Hooker's 'Boogie Chillen,' ... When I found John Lee Hooker on the radio, I said, 'If that guy can play, I know I can.' I mean John Lee's got a hell of a style\\". In an interview, Buddy Guy described learning to play \\"Boogie Chillen'\\" at age thirteen: \\"that was the first thing I thought I learned how to play that I knew sounded right when someone would listen.\\" Guy later recorded a version with Junior Wells for their 1981 album Alone & Acoustic. Albert Collins also recalled that it was the first song he learned to play. The success of \\"Boogie Chillen'\\" brought numerous offers for John Lee Hooker to record for other record companies. Because he received little remuneration from the sales of his record, Hooker readily accepted the opportunities to generate income. This led to his recording using a variety of pseudonyms, including Texas Slim, Little Pork Chops, Delta John, Birmingham Sam, the Boogie Man, Johnny Williams, John Lee Booker, John Lee Cooker, and others for such labels as King, Danceland, Regent, Savoy, Acorn, Prize, Staff, Gotham, Gone, Chess, and Swing Time. Later Hooker versions The demand for \\"Boogie Chillen'\\" remained high enough for Hooker to re-record the song several times. In 1950, he recorded a faster version with different lyrics as \\"Boogie Chillen' #2\\" for Bernie Besman's Sensation label (also issued by Regal). Modern Records released an edited version in 1952 titled \\"New Boogie Chillun\\". After Hooker began his association with Vee-Jay Records, he recorded \\"Boogie Chillun\\" in 1959, which closely follows the original single. Because of the similarity, the 1959 version is sometimes misidentified as the 1948 version and vice versa (at 2:36, the Vee-Jay version is about a half a minute shorter than the original).Hooker 'n Heat album cover (front) The first two takes from the September 1948 Detroit recording session began appearing on various compilation albums in the 1970s, sometimes with the titles \\"John Lee's Original Boogie\\" and \\"Henry's Swing Club\\". Meanwhile, Modern and its associated labels including Kent and Crown reissued the song several times. From the 1960s onwards, Hooker recorded several studio and live renditions of \\"Boogie Chillen'\\", with guest musicians such as Eric Clapton and the Rolling Stones. In 1970, he recorded an updated version of the song, titled \\"Boogie Chillen' No. 2\\", with the blues rock group Canned Heat for their joint album, Hooker 'n Heat. Blues historian Gerard Herzhaft describes the performance as a \\"memorable one\\". It combines Hooker's vocal and Canned Heat's signature boogie rock backing, as heard in the group's jam song \\"Fried Hockey Boogie\\" (itself an adaptation of \\"Boogie Chillen'\\"). Despite being over eleven minutes long with extended guitar and harmonica solos, it remains as \\"full of the same swagger as the original\\". Recognition and legacy In 1985, Hooker's 1948 recording of \\"Boogie Chillen'\\" was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame. Writing for the Foundation, blues historian Jim O'Neal noted it was \\"the first down-home electric blues record to achieve No. 1 chart status and its success, together with that of the Hooker hits that followed, inspired record companies to search out the new electric generation of country bluesmen\\". In 1999, it received a Grammy Hall of Fame Award and is included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame list of the \\"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\". \\"Boogie Chillen'\\" was added to the U.S. National Recording Registry in 2008, which noted that \\"the driving rhythm and confessional lyrics have guaranteed its place as an influential and enduring blues classic\\". Authors Jim Dawson and Steve Propes included it in their 1992 book What Was the First Rock 'n' Roll Record?, identifying it among the precursors of rock and roll. \\"Boogie Chillen'\\" has inspired several songs, beginning in 1953, when Junior Parker recorded his interpretation titled \\"Feelin' Good\\". It became Parker's first hit for Sun Records and was subsequently recorded by James Cotton in 1967 and by Magic Sam as \\"I Feel So Good (I Wanna Boogie)\\" for his influential 1967 album West Side Soul. A version by Slim Harpo, titled \\"Boogie Chillun\\", appeared on his 1970 album Slim Harpo Knew the Blues using a similar arrangement to his 1966 hit \\"Shake Your Hips\\". Other songs that borrow from \\"Boogie Chillen'\\" or \\"Boogie Chillen' No. 2\\", either directly or indirectly, include the radio hits \\"On the Road Again\\" by Canned Heat in 1968, \\"Spirit in the Sky\\" by Norman Greenbaum in 1970, and \\"La Grange\\" by ZZ Top in 1973. Copyright issues In 1991, Bernie Besman, as the song's publisher, La Cienega Music, brought legal action against ZZ Top for copyright infringement for their song \\"La Grange\\". Writer Timothy English notes that of the various Hooker recordings of \\"Boogie Chillen'\\", the one released in 1971 with Canned Heat \\"has the most elements in common with 'La Grange', including the guitar pattern and the 'howl, howl, howl' vocal line\\". The case wound its way through the American legal system (including an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court). When the ruling did not favor the publisher, the U.S. Congress was persuaded to amend the Copyright Act in 1998 to protect many songs recorded before 1978 from entering the public domain. ZZ Top settled out of court in 1997, but Hooker again gained no financial reward from his song‚ÄîBesman had obtained Hooker's rights to the song years earlier. However, Gioia noted, \\"Nonetheless, his [John Lee Hooker's 1948] spontaneous performance in a recording studio had led to a substantial change in U.S. intellectual property law\\".

The station first signed on in the 1940s as KXOA-FM, an FM simulcast of AM station KXOA, before separating itself with distinct programming, including most prominently soft rock and classic hits formats. In July 1998, following the sale of the station to Entercom, the station switched to its final KDND call letters and Top 40/CHR format branded as 107.9 The End. At the time of the station's closing, KDND's studios were located in North Highlands (though with a Sacramento address), while its transmitter was located just north of the Sacramento city limits near Elverta. In January 2007, KDND's morning show controversially held an on-air contest in which contestants were challenged to drink as much water as they could without urinating, in order to win a Nintendo Wii video game console. A 28-year-old participant in the contest died of water intoxication, resulting in Entercom being sued for wrongful death by the participant's family. The FCC also investigated the incident, and in 2016, stated that it had placed the renewal of KDND's license under review, questioning whether the station had operated in the public interest. Citing that its continued operation could affect Entercom's proposed acquisition of CBS Radio, KDND was shut down on February 8, 2017, and its format and branding were moved to KUDL two days earlier on February 6. History = As KXOA-FM = KXOA-FM began as a simulcast of KXOA in 1945. During this period, KXOA broadcast a traditional MOR/block programming format. In the mid-1950s, KXOA changed to a Top 40 format. KXOA-FM continued to simulcast the AM station through the 1960s. However, the station briefly ran a Country and Western format as KCNW-FM. The format and call letters ran from the Summer of 1961 through the Summer of 1962, when KRAK (1140) debuted with a Country and Western format. The station returned to simulcasting KXOA and re-adopted the KXOA-FM call letters. In the 1960s, the FCC dictated that all FM stations in areas having a population greater than 250,000 people must dedicate at least 50% of their broadcast schedule to separate programming from AM sister stations. In the late 1960s, KXOA-FM partially separated from its AM counterpart and broadcast adult contemporary music from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., and then simulcasting KXOA's Top 40 programming until it signed off at midnight. In 1970, KXOA-FM switched to an automated Country format. During this time, KXOA AM and FM were sold to separate parties. The AM station was sold to investors involved in the ownership of KSJO in San Jose. The FM station was sold to Drake-Chenault, a national radio syndicator, who moved the station to Loma Vista Drive off Fulton Avenue. In early 1971, they flipped KXOA-FM to their syndicated Solid Gold format, which featured pop hits from the 1950s through the present. In August 1972, the station flipped a progressive rock-oriented format branded as Earth Rock 108; the station hired Steve Rosetta as General Manager and Rick Carroll from KNDE as a consultant. Air talent from this era included Tom Buck, Greg Mundae, Tom Cale, and Kent Randles. In February 1973, the station was switched to an automated oldies format branded as Nostalgia Radio. Shift to soft rock In June 1974, Drake‚ÄîChenault sold the station to San Diego-based Brown Broadcasting, owners of KGB-AM-FM; the station re-branded as Super Stereo K-108, featuring top 40 music, and album-oriented rock at night. By early 1975, the station had shifted to an album-oriented soft rock format branded as The Mellow Home; the format was successful throughout the remaining half of the 1970s. During the 1980s, the station pivoted to a soft adult contemporary format, remaining successful throughout the remainder of the decade. Despite changes in ownership and format, staff turnover was rare. On-air personalities included Dusty Morgan, Dave Allen, and Tom Nakashima. KXOA-AM-FM simulcast broadcasts of American Top 40 with Casey Kasem during this period. K-108 FM also had a strong commitment to news and public affairs programming during the 1980s through the early 1990s. News director and morning news anchor Ken Hunt and his news team, (primarily Nanci McGraw from 1981 to 1986), won multiple journalism awards from the Associated Press TV Radio News Association and the Radio TV News Directors Association for news programming distinguished by its local coverage, creative use of natural sound and conversational style. In the early 1990s, KXOA-FM's popularity began to wane following the launch of competitors in KYMX and KGBY. In response, in May 1993, the station flipped to a more uptempo adult contemporary format branded as Xtra 107.9, advertising itself as featuring \\"No Rap, Metal, or Madonna\\".\\"A competitor to Y92 rises from the ashes of K108\\", The Sacramento Bee, May 22, 1993. The format did not improve KXOA's ratings; on March 25, 1994, the station flipped to a classic hits format branded as Arrow 108, adapted from Los Angeles' KCBS-FM. =As KDND= In 1996, Brown Broadcasting sold KXOA-FM to Entercom; on July 14, 1998, at Noon, KXOA flipped to Top 40/CHR, branded as 107.9 The End, and changed its call letters to KDND. The first song on \\"The End\\" was \\"Everybody\\" by Backstreet Boys. The KXOA call letters, as well as the Arrow format and branding, were moved to KRAK-FM.\\"Arrow 108 gives way to top 40\\", The Sacramento Bee, July 15, 1998. =\\"Hold Your Wee for a Wii\\" contest= On January 12, 2007, KDND's morning show, the Morning Rave, held an on-air contest entitled Hold Your Wee for a Wii, in which contestants were asked to drink as much water as they could without urinating. The contestant able to hold the most water would win a Wii video game console; at the time, the Nintendo console was a very popular and sought-after item, but was nearly impossible to find in stores in North America. A 28-year-old contestant, Jennifer Strange, died of water intoxication hours after taking part in the contest. According to contest participants, 17 to 20 contestants took part in the competition in a room at KDND's studios. The contest began around 6:45 a.m. as contestants were each handed 240ml (8 oz) water bottles to drink at 15-minute intervals. Contestants also said that as the contest progressed, they were given increasingly larger quantities of water to drink. According to witness reports, Strange, who placed second in the contest, may have drunk nearly . Some later remarked on the physical discomfort they suffered during and following the event. The Sacramento Bee released audio clips from the morning show indicating that the disc jockeys were aware of the death of Matthew Carrington by water intoxication. At one point, a caller contacted the station and informed the DJs that the contest could be dangerous and potentially fatal. The DJs responded by saying, \\"We're aware of that,\\" and said that the contestants had signed releases and couldn't file a lawsuit. According to a contestant, the waivers addressed only publicity issues and made no mention of health or safety concerns. The DJs also joked about Strange's distended belly, joking that she looked three months pregnant. After the contest, Strange spoke to a co-worker by telephone, indicating she was on her way home and in extreme pain, suffering from what appeared to be an intense headache. The co-worker contacted Strange's mother, who went to her home an hour later to find her daughter dead. Aftermath On January 15, 2007, the front page of KDND's website was replaced with a message from John Geary, the station's vice-president and general manager, expressing sympathies to Strange's family and announcing that the Morning Rave program would be taken off the air indefinitely. On January 16, 2007, Geary dismissed ten station employees ‚Äì including the three morning disc jockeys, Adam \\"Lukas\\" Cox, Steve Maney and Patricia \\"Trish\\" Sweet ‚Äì from their positions in connection with the tragedy and cancelled the Morning Rave. All references to the Morning Rave program and associated DJs were removed from the KDND website. The Associated Press reported that the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department spokesman said no officers were investigating the death, and that, \\"It was a contest and people are saying there was no coercion.\\"\\"Station fires 10 over woman's death following water-drinking contest\\" However, Deborah Hoffman of KXTV reported that former prosecutor Bill Portanova commented that \\"the radio station has some serious liability exposure\\", due in part to widespread news coverage of the Matthew Carrington case two years earlier. On January 17, 2007, The Los Angeles Times reported that Sacramento Sheriff John McGinness ordered homicide detectives to investigate whether a crime had been committed. On April 2, the Sacramento County District Attorney's Office declined to press criminal charges, citing a \\"lack of evidence of criminal misconduct.\\" On January 18, 2007, a wrongful death lawsuit was announced on behalf of Strange's husband and three children against Entercom and KDND's operating subsidiary Entercom Sacramento LLC. The Strange family was represented by prominent Sacramento attorney Roger A. Dreyer of the firm of Dreyer, Babich, Buccola & Callaham, LLP. The Stranges urged the FCC to shut down the station and punish Entercom. On January 24, 2007, the FCC announced that it would investigate KDND to see if it violated the terms of its license.Sacramento Bee: FCC to investigate woman's death after radio show contest (1-24-07) On August 16, 2007, it was reported that two of the KDND DJs, Lukas Cox and Steve Maney, were suing Entercom over a wrongful termination of their contract. Subsequently, both DJs settled with Entercom for an undisclosed amount. On September 14, 2009, jury selection in the wrongful death case began at the Sacramento County Superior Court's main courthouse in the city of Sacramento. Over the next month, the jury heard testimony from over 41 witnesses as 192 exhibits were entered into evidence. On October 29, 2009, after a week of deliberations, the jury awarded the survivors of Jennifer Strange the sum of $16,577,118 in monetary damages. Entercom Sacramento LLC was found to be 100% at fault for Strange's death while Entercom Communications was found to be 0% at fault. They also found that Strange was 0% at fault (that is, there was no contributory negligence) for her own death. The former \\"Morning Rave\\" hosts have since found other radio jobs in different markets; Cox hosts mornings at KRBB in Wichita, Kansas. Maney hosts mornings on WNKS in Charlotte, and Sweet hosted mornings on WPLJ in New York City under the name Jayde Donovan until 2019 when the WPLJ ended its format and was sold to another owner; Jayde now hosts a show on Apple Music 1 and was also on WMTX in Tampa, Florida.https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/08/apple-announces-apple-music- radio/https://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/187680/jayde-back-in- tampa-at-wmtx-with-syndicated-jayde- The Media Action Center, a watchdog organization founded by former producer Sue Wilson, filed a complaint against KDND's license when it was up for renewal in 2013. In October 2016, the FCC designated Entercom's license renewal for KDND for a hearing, disputing whether the station had operated in the public interest over its previous license term. = Later years = Shortly prior to the start of jury selection in the trial, KDND began to tease that it would be \\"saying goodbye\\" on September 8, 2009, leading to speculation that the station was planning to drop The End in favor of a different format, or shut down entirely. However, an unpublished page on the station's website, located by a KTXL viewer, subsequently revealed that the slogan was actually referring to a commercial- free Tuesdays promotion that the station was starting that day. KDND subsequently confirmed the announcement. = Shutdown = Final logo as 107.9 The End before 2017 On February 2, 2017, Entercom announced its intent to acquire CBS Radio. The next day, Entercom announced that KDND would cease operations effective February 8, and that its license would be terminated and returned to the FCC. Entercom stated that \\"it is in the company's best interests to voluntarily turn in the KDND license to facilitate the timely FCC approvals for the planned combination with CBS Radio.\\" The then-chief of enforcement for the FCC stated to the Sacramento Bee that the motive was financial, and that Entercom would have likely have fought had a merger not been planned. KDND's format and The End branding were re-located to sister station KUDL at 9:00 a.m. on February 6, 2017 (the last song before the move was \\"Scars to Your Beautiful\\" by Alessia Cara). 107.9 then began stunting with a jockless playlist of pop music occasionally interrupted by static-backed liners redirecting listeners to KUDL and advising remaining listeners of the impending shutoff of the signal; this would later transition to a loop of \\"Bye Bye Bye\\" by N'Sync and \\"End\\" staffers redirecting listeners to KUDL. As the station's final program, a farewell special aired at 11:30 p.m. on the 7th, hosted by former afternoon DJ Chris K, playing music from the End's 18-year history was broadcast. This special also culminated with \\"Bye Bye Bye\\" by N'Sync. The station did not state its callsign at sign-off, as before the song was finished, KDND's transmitter was shut down on February 8 at 12:01 a.m., bringing a close to the 72-year history of the station. Entercom also paid the Media Action Center $35,000 for attorney fees involved in their petition to deny renewal. In return, the Media Action Center would not challenge other Entercom licenses or the CBS Radio acquisition. Deletion of license On September 7, 2017, the FCC deleted the license for KDND after denying a Petition For Reconsideration and Application For Review filed by former 106.5 KWOD owner Ed Stolz, who had sought to have his 1996 sale of the station rescinded so he could resume control. The FCC ruled that Stolz's arguments had no merit and, additionally, he is not a party of interest in the dispute between Media Action Center and Entercom that led to the license revocation hearing. Allocation Status The FCC returned the 107.9 frequency on which KDND was licensed to operate to the agency's inventory of unused channels, to be put up for auction to the highest bidder. The FCC stipulated that use of the frequency must retain its short-spaced protections to Cumulus Media‚Äôs 107.7 KSAN San Mateo, California. Any applicant will be limited to 50 kW ERP and an average height above average terrain of 123 meters in the direction of KSAN.‚ÄúFCC Report 2/9: Reminding 107.9 Sacramento Applicants Of Short-Spacing Protections‚Äù from Radio Insight (February 9, 2020) The FCC included the 107.9 frequency in its auction scheduled to begin April 28, 2020, but the auction was indefinitely postponed on March 25, 2020, due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Its name was given in honour of Princess Alexandra of Denmark, who in 1863 married the Prince of Wales Edward VII and eventually became Queen of the United Kingdom. Other names for the species include: Queen Alexandra parrot (or parakeet), Alexandra's parakeet, Princess of Wales parakeet, rose-throated parakeet, and spinifex parrot. Their plumage is mostly green with a pink throat, bluish crown and rump, and bright green shoulders. Description A male (\\"Monty\\") at Bloedel Conservatory, Vancouver, Canada A male Princess parrot. The princess parrot is a medium-sized parrot, 34 to 46 cm long and weighing between 110 and 120 g. The plumage is mostly green with a pink throat, bluish crown, and bright green shoulders. The rump is blue and the tail is long and narrow. The males have longer tail feathers and brighter coloring than females. The male also has a coral-red beak, while the female's is duller and has a greyish crown. Another difference is that the male has an orange iris, while the female's is much browner. In addition, the male of the species has a longer, projecting extension from the end of the 3rd primary (flight) feather on each side. This projection is called a 'spatula' or 'spatule' and appears in mature male birds. Behaviour This species is nomadic, arriving in small groups to breed and then disappearing. It is one of Australia's least known parrots because it is so elusive, even though it is spread across the interior of Australia. It inhabits arid woodland and scrub with spinifex, eucalypts, acacias, etc. They are unusual among parrots in engaging in mobbing behaviour against predators. They feed on the seeds of grasses and shrubs. =Breeding= Four to six white eggs are laid which are incubated for 19 days. The chicks leave the nest about 35 days after hatching. These parakeets are truly opportunistic breeders, with pairs choosing to nest when food is plentiful. They nest in a hollow in a eucalypt or desert oak. Aviculture A blue mutant variety in front of a normal wild type at Flying High Bird Habitat, Australia The princess parrot can make loud calls. Their life span is thought to be as long as 30 years. Under the right circumstances they are able to bond to more than one member of the host family. These birds have a short range of mimicking ability, yet some have the ability to \\"talk\\". They are a favourite among many aviculturists and pet owners because of their looks and personality. Their diet consists of reasonable sized seeds and grasses that have seeds. They can be constipated if given bread or seeds that are small or become wet, they can become ill if seed bowls are contaminated by rats or mice so are best fed on an inverted ceramic pot with the bowl on top not wider than the top as they will dislodge the feed bowl. There are three common color mutations of this parakeet. These colours are Lutino, Blue, and Albino (combination of Blue and Lutino). The natural, or 'normal' color is green. There are two types of blue, one blue winged and the second is bright blue wings and bright blue head. A male princess parrot perched on a branch.

These leaves are used in south central Indian cuisine to impart a tart flavour. Gongura comes in two varieties, green stemmed leaf and red stemmed. The red stemmed variety is more sour than the green stemmed variety. Gongura is a rich source of iron, vitamins, folic acid and anti-oxidants essential for human nutrition.Indian Home Cooking, S. Saran and S. Lyness, 2004 Gongura pacchadi is quintessentially Telugu cuisine along with pacchadi (chutney or relish). Telugu people, mainly from the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, India, locally called it as Andhra Matha (mother Andhra) in Telugu due to significance in their day to day diet. While it has many culinary uses, the most popular is the pickled version. Although Gongura is widely consumed all over Andhra Pradesh, Gongura is more popular in hotels, restaurants, eateries and food joints. It is also grown in Odisha, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh (north east region of India) and also some parts of Chittagong Hill Tracts region in Bangladesh (which is mainly a tribal people region). It is a very popular green vegetable in Chakma community and it is known as \\"Aamelli\\". Similarly, Gongura is popular in Tamil Nadu as well, and is called pulichakeerai (‡Æ™‡ØÅ‡Æ≥‡Æø‡Æö‡Øç‡Æö‡Øà‡Æï‡Øç ‡Æï‡ØÄ‡Æ∞‡Øà) in Tamil. In Odisha it's known as ‡¨ó‡≠ã‡¨∞‡¨ï‡≠Å‡¨∞‡¨æ (gorkura) or ‡¨ñ‡¨ü‡¨æ ‡¨™‡¨æ‡¨≥‡¨ô‡≠ç‡¨ó (khata palangaw).

The famous combination with pulichakeerai is Ragi Kali/Ragi Mudde, which once used to be a regular food for the people in villages (since these items are easily available in agricultural forms). In Marathi, it is called Ambaadi (‡§Ö‡§Ç‡§¨‡§æ‡§°‡•Ä).

It is a summer crop, and the hotter the place, the more sour the leaf gets. Sold on a street in Andhra Pradesh Gongura is popular in the state of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Manipur, Tripura and also Mizoram. A baby gongura leaf is a full leaf. As the leaf grows older, the leaf splits into four or more parts.

They are a staple food at fairs and barbecues in the Central New York region, where they are most popular. Potatoes specifically intended for salt potatoes can be purchased by the bag along with packages of salt. As the potatoes cook, the salty water forms a crust on the skin and seals the potatoes, making them taste different from regular boiled potatoes. The standard recipe calls for one pound of salt for every four pounds of potatoes. Background The Syracuse area of New York has a long history of salt production. Salt springs located around Onondaga Lake were used to create consumable salt that was distributed throughout the northeast via the Erie Canal. Salinated brine was laid out to dry on large trays. The salt residue was then scraped up, ground, and packaged. Salt potatoes originated in Syracuse and comprised most of a salt worker's daily diet. During the 1800s, Irish salt miners would bring a bag of small, unpeeled, substandard potatoes to work each day. At lunch time, they boiled the potatoes in salt brine. =Preparation= Salt potatoes are bite- size \\"young\\" white potatoes scrubbed and boiled in their skins. The use of red-skinned new potatoes is not considered authentic. The proper size of potatoes are Size B, Grade US No. 2. According to a recipe, the cooking water contains salt in a ratio of one cup of salt to six cups of water, giving the dish its name, unique flavor, and texture. After cooking, salt potatoes are served with melted butter. The resulting potatoes are creamy, as the starch in the potatoes cooks more completely due to the higher boiling temperature of the extra-salty water. The salty skin stands up particularly well to both herbed and plain melted butter. Salt potatoes in Germany In Germany there is a dish with the same name, Salzkartoffeln. However, far less salt is used compared to Syracuse salt potatoes; also, the potatoes are peeled prior to cooking. So, despite the direct literal translation, Boiled Potatoes would be a more practical interpretation. Salzkartoffeln is a popular side dish in many German meals. The name Salzkartoffeln is used to distinguish peeled potatoes boiled in slightly salted water from unpeeled ones, usually boiled without any salt. The latter is called Pellkartoffeln (\\"potatoes in peel\\") and is eaten with butter or quark cheese.

It originally aired in the United States on June 21, 2000, on Comedy Central. In the episode, Cartman, in search of more mature friends, accidentally joins the \\"North American Man/Boy Love Association\\" (NAMBLA), and puts all the boys of South Park in jeopardy as a result. Meanwhile, Kenny tries to stop his mother and father from having another baby. Plot Cartman decides he is too mature to hang out with Stan, Kyle, and Kenny after Cartman disapproves of poor couples (like Kenny's parents) having more children, so he starts to look for older male friends in an Internet chat room. He stumbles upon the topic \\"Men Who Like Young Boys\\" and talks to some eager men who Cartman believes want to be friends with him. In reality, they are actually Internet predators who prey on young boys. Cartman meets a pedophile who goes by the Internet handle Tony316 at Mel's Diner. Much to Cartman's anger, he ends up arrested for soliciting sex from a minor. The next day, Cartman goes to meet a \\"Mr. Hammerhead\\", who, to Cartman's surprise, turns out to be Mr. Garrison, who is also arrested. Na√Øvely concluding that Stan and Kyle are behind his new \\"mature\\" friends getting arrested, Cartman goes to see Dr. Mephesto about where he might find mature friends. Dr. Mephesto advises Cartman to join an organization known as NAMBLA, saying \\"you look about right.\\" However, the NAMBLA that Dr. Mephesto is referring to is a fictional club for men who look like Marlon Brando (the North American Marlon Brando Look-Alikes). Cartman finds the North American Man/Boy Love Association, asks to join, and is made their poster boy. The organization decides to hold a banquet in Cartman's honor and asks him to invite all the boys in town. Cartman does so, with the exception of Stan and Kyle. Federal officials, having learned that NAMBLA is meeting in South Park, raid the venue. However, they discover that they have raided the wrong NAMBLA meeting, that of Dr. Mephesto's group. The FBI teams up with the Marlon Brando lookalikes and rushes to stop the other NAMBLA's banquet. There, all the boys in town (including Stan and Kyle who were also invited) are in attendance, unaware of what is in store for them until the pedophiles take them to their hotel rooms, after which the boys run screaming in the halls. Meanwhile, Stuart and Carol McCormick are trying to have another baby. As Kenny does not like the idea, he tries to prevent the baby's conception by tricking his father into playing catch, in which he hurls a fastball at his father's crotch to shatter his left testicle. When his mother gets pregnant anyway, he tries again by adding morning-after pills to a chocolate milk/vodka cocktail and gives it to his mother, who refuses to drink because of her pregnancy. Instead Stuart drinks it and as a result rushes to the bathroom where he repeatedly vomits and defecates. Later, Kenny convinces his family to go with him to North Park Funland to ride The John Denver Experience, a violent ride not recommended for pregnant women. However, Stuart gets a broken nose from the ride and ends up vomiting, defecating, and now, draining his bloody nose into a garbage can. After another nightmare involving the new baby, an enraged Kenny chases his mother through the town and into the NAMBLA hotel with a plunger, attempting to plunge the fetus out of her. Upon seeing this, Stuart angrily chases after Kenny to stop him from hurting his mother and their unborn child. The two plots collide when the Marlon Brando look-alikes and the federal officers arrive at the hotel, and a madcap chase with the boys, both NAMBLAs (one of which are running naked), and the feds ensues. Kenny, still chasing after his mother and in turn being chased by his father, joins in. Cartman decides that Butters should be the sacrificial lamb for the pedophiles to have their way with. While Butters is sent into an empty room and leaves unharmed, Stuart enters a room to search for Kenny, only to find the NAMBLA pedophiles, who somehow mistake him for a little boy and proceed to gang-rape him. In the end, all of the North American Man/Boy Love Association members are arrested by the FBI and they try to weasel their way out of jailtime by giving out a speech equating pedophilia with being an oppressed minority and that they simply cannot help their sexual attraction to young boys. It nearly works, as the FBI agents seem to be buying his stance, but Stan and Kyle retort at this by stating that, while they believe in tolerance and equality for all, the members of NAMBLA are criminals who molest children (who should never endure sex at such a young age) and therefore deserve to be treated as such. As the pedophiles are taken away to custody, Cartman backhandedly apologizes to his friends (including Butters) for almost getting them raped, assuring that they will \\"blossom into maturity\\" someday. The raped Stuart is loaded into an ambulance, which accidentally goes in reverse and runs over Kenny, killing him instantly. Afterwards, Carol gives birth to an identical child they name Kenny, which she says has happened 52 times before. The French music (Page d'√©criture by Yves Montand) that was played during the hallway scene is played during the closing credits. Production \\"Cartman Joins NAMBLA\\" was written by series co-founders Trey Parker and Matt Stone, was directed by Eric Stough, and was rated TV-MA in the United States and 15 in the United Kingdom. In 2006, IGN listed the episode as #8 on a list of their 10 Favorite South Park Episodes.  Censorship  * The British satellite channel Sky One banned the episode, due to the strong pedophilia references in the main plot and the subplot being centered on Kenny killing his mother's unborn child.

Overview Located at approximately 1,200 meters above sea level, the municipality's cool climate lends itself to many thriving local plant nurseries, some of which specialize in tropical flowers such as birds of paradise, anthuriums, orchids, and varieties of bromelias. The town is famous for its volcanic lake, the Alegr√≠a Laguna, which is a national protected area managed by the NGO ADESCAM. There is a local myth that a siren or mermaid lives in the lake, and that she will lure men who swim there to their deaths. Rural villages belonging to the municipality include El Zapotillo.Laguna de Alegria Iglesia de Alegria, Usulutan. Laguna Alegr√≠a Laguna de Alegria In the Sierra of Chinameca, one of the most important volcanoes is Tecapa, located at 26 kilometers away from Usulut√°n, and 2 kilometers to the south of Alegria. Its peak, in the famous plain of Quemela, at 1,603 meters above sea level exhibits a big rocky crater, oval and guided from east to west in whose bottom, in eccentric position to the southeast and at 1,250 meters high, a small crater form lake of yellow-greenish waters exists, resting on mantels of sulfur. The highest part of the crater circumvallation to the northeast is the culminating point of the volcanic cone and the lowest is to the east and at 1,275 meters high. In that area a current of lava was spilled in prehistoric time. The little lagoon is one of the most beautiful places of the country. It was called formerly Tecapa, the same as the volcano, but from recent times it is also denominated \\"Laguna de Alegria\\", because it is next to the city of the same name. It has thermal sources and fumaroles, mainly in the northwest direction and a circumvallation highway for driven vehicles. In nahuat language the name of Tecapa means \\"Lagoon of stones.\\" In the skirts of the volcano Tecapa, to the north, are the thermal sources or fumaroles of Bufadero, Tronador, Tronadorcito, Loma China, and El Pinar. Laguna de Alegria is also known as \\"America's Emerald\\" thanks to Gabriela Mistral nobel prize in literature winner in 1945. In the park of the city of Alegria, the bust in memory of educator Presbytery Jos√© Miguel Alegria is erected. He was a remarkable professor of Latin who founded in the town of Tecapa around 1838, a philosophy school. Because of the Law of February 17 of 1891, the city of Tecapa was denominated city of Alegria. This famous professor's body remains in the crypt of this population's parochial church. The current temple of Alegria began being built on August 26, 1870. Alegria is the cradle of the illustrious Salvadoran teacher and thinker don Alberto Masferrer.

Etymology The city's name was suggested by Don Seraf√≠n Brennen, a German, who also founded the city. History The area of what is now Berl√≠n was settled by the Lenca and Pipil peoples. Overview The municipality of Berl√≠n is made up of an urban center (pop. approx. 12,000) and 17 cantons or villages (pop. approx. 30,000). The urban center is located at 1,020 meters above sea level in the mountains of eastern El Salvador, with the territory extending to lowland cantons (zona baja) on the Lempa River and to highland cantons (zona alta) at as much as 1,500 meters above sea level. Some of the rural cantons include: Talpetates, Loma Alta, Las Delicias, El Colon, El Tablon. Berlin is known for coffee farming, which historically was the main economic activity for the municipality and concentrated in the zona alta. In the zona baja, including the Mechotique region, activities include cattle and sugar cane farming, as well as farming of subsistence crops such as beans and corn. Nearby municipalities include Mercedes Uma√±a and Santiago de Maria; the largest nearby city is San Miguel. Berl√≠n's patron saint is San Jos√©, and the annual patron saint festival is celebrated from March 15‚Äì20. The city boasts two high schools, a coffee processing plant, a bank, a credit union, a thriving municipal market, a youth community center, numerous small businesses, a Catholic church, and several Evangelical congregations. During the Salvadoran Civil War, Berl√≠n was the site of several battles between the FMLN and military forces. The FMLN took control of the city for five days in 1983, but were driven out by heavy bombing by the military. The engagement resulted in significant destruction of property and civilian deaths. Berl√≠n was heavily damaged by flooding and landslides resulting from Hurricane Mitch in 1998 and by the earthquakes of January and February, 2001. To mitigate potential future natural disasters, an Environmental Unit (Unidad Ambiental) has been established within the mayor's office. A severe thunderstorm with heavy rain caused flooding and landslides in May 2007 which resulted in the deaths of 5 people. Efforts are currently underway to relocate the Brisas del Sol community, where the victims were from, away from the high risk area.

She has also written restaurant reviews for The Sunday Telegraph. Williams has appeared as a guest on television. Clive James praised her appearance in documentary Teenage Kicks: the Search for Sophistication: \\"The brilliant journalist Zoe Williams did a short piece to camera that was almost an aria\\". She has presented a radio documentary Inside the Academy School Revolution, which Miranda Sawyer found one-sided and \\"tame\\", and hosted BBC Radio 4's What The Papers Say. In May 2011, Williams wrote about fare dodging when in her 30s while travelling on London buses. She wrote \\"I actually had a lot of affection for bendy buses, mainly because evading your fare was so easy that to pay was almost missing the point. We used to call it freebussing.\\" In 2014, she defended the social policy legacy of former Labour prime minister Tony Blair and denounced those calling him a war criminal, and has strongly condemned the rule of Fidel Castro in Cuba. She sometimes covers feminist issues in her columns, and is a supporter of Humanists UK.

In August 2015, Williams endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. She wrote in The Guardian: \\"The point is, Corbyn doesn't have to be right about everything; he doesn't have to be certain, and fully costed about everything; he doesn't even have to be responsive and listening to everything. This political moment is about breaking open the doors and letting the 21st century in\\".

Criticism  In February 2020 Williams was criticised online and in Nation.Cymru for her comments about the Welsh language. Her exercise article criticised a particular Canadian fitness regime as \\"hard and existentially pointless\\", continuing: \\"all that energy spent, no distance covered: it's like eating cottage cheese or learning Welsh.\\" Williams had however previously praised the language for giving Welsh speakers \\"a more internationalist outlook\\". Personal life Williams lives in Camberwell, South London, with her husband. Williams married the father of her son and daughter in 2013 after ten years together and wrote about the wedding from a feminist perspective in her column for The Guardian.

She spent a short time in a coma before emerging into a state of post-coma unresponsiveness. She became the centre of a controversy in Australia during 2005. Depending upon their viewpoint, people have characterised the controversy as being about euthanasia or about human rights and protecting people with disabilities. On 26 July 2005 Victoria's Public Advocate, Julian Gardner, announced that the feeding tube to Korp would cease to be used for providing artificial nutrition and hydration, that palliative care would be implemented and that she was expected to die within 7 to 14 days. Korp died on 5 August 2005. Her husband's mistress, Tania Herman, pleaded guilty on 8 June 2005 to attempted murder, and was sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment; husband Joe Korp, also charged with her attempted murder, committed suicide on the day of her funeral. Investigation Joe Korp The brother of Korp's husband, Gust Korp, had earlier reported his concerns about Korp's safety to police on 9 February 2005.Crawford, Carly \\"the Maria Korp Case\\" Harper Collins 2006 page 16 Joe Korp stated he last saw his wife at their suburban Mickleham home at approximately 6:30 a.m. that day. Korp was later found unconscious, locked in the boot of her car near the Shrine of Remembrance in Dallas Brooks Drive, in Kings Domain, Melbourne on 13 February 2005. She was taken to nearby Alfred Hospital, and was found to have suffered oxygen starvation to the brain, head injuries and severe dehydration. She went into a medically induced coma, and was placed on life support. On 16 February 2005, police charged Joe Korp, 47, and his mistress Tania Herman, 38, with the attempted murder of Korp, conspiracy to murder, and intentionally causing serious injury. Both appeared the following day in Melbourne Magistrates' Court and were remanded in custody. On 28 April 2005, the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal appointed Victoria's Public Advocate, Julian Gardner as Korp's legal guardian. Herman pleaded guilty on 8 June to the attempted murder of Korp (this charge was never upgraded to murder when Korp subsequently died) and was sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of nine years.. Joe Korp pleaded not guilty on all charges and was later released on bail on 9 June, and committed to stand trial. A further charge of murder had been expected to be laid against him, and he had applied for bail modification so that he could visit his dying wife in hospital. Gardner, who had authority to determine access to Korp approved a visit supervised by his staff and police. Euthanasia controversy On 26 July, Gardner announced that medical treatment for Korp in the form of artificial nutrition and hydration would cease, that palliative care treatment would be provided and that she was expected to die within one to two weeks. Her condition had been declining, and medical staff could no longer stabilise her condition. \\"The treating team at the Alfred Hospital has advised me that her condition is now terminal\\", Gardner said. Anti-euthanasia campaigners threatened legal action in an attempt to save Korp in August, 2005. They held peaceful protests outside Melbourne's Alfred Hospital to demonstrate against the \\"inhumane\\" decision by Gardner, to stop artificially feeding her. Korp's artificial nutrition and hydration was ceased on 27 July on the decision of Gardner, who stated that all of the doctors who had examined her (including a specialist independent of the hospital arranged by Gardner) had advised that further treatment other than palliative care was futile and that she had no prospects of recovery. He concluded on the basis of the medical evidence and on the basis of evidence of her beliefs and values that continued treatment was not in her best interests.Crawford, Carly \\"the Maria Korp Case\\" Harper Collins 2006 page 266 An appeal against Gardner's appointment‚Äîas a legal means of challenging his decision‚Äîas Korp's guardian was reportedly considered by opponents of his decision but no appeal was made. The protest group's spokesperson reported to the media that they would be willing to give anything a try in order to stop her from dying from starvation. Korp's husband had publicly stated through his lawyers that he would fight in the courts any attempt to withdraw medical treatment. It was for that reason that the hospital sought the appointment of a guardian. It was only after Gardner approved his visit to Korp that he changed his mind. Her daughter, Laura De Gois, indicated that she did not oppose Gardner's decision. According to an ABC radio report, Gardner explained that they talked over a period of months to people who knew her well, including her priest, to find out what she believed, and took advice from \\"an expert Catholic ethicist\\". He was provided with details of the medical evidence and asked to consider whether, given that evidence of her medical condition, withdrawal of treatment other than palliative care would be in accordance with the statement on this issue by the former Pope in April 2004. He concluded that it would be. Many of her family members were against the cessation of life support. Their reasons were not publicly stated other than to claim that the doctors were wrong and that Korp was not dying. This was the basis of the comments by a family member in Portugal. It is only possible to speculate whether family members' opposition was to avoid Joe Korp being charged with murder or whether they saw withdrawal of life support as euthanasia which is considered a sin in the Roman Catholic Church. The controversy was heightened by the fact that it occurred at the end of the internationally publicised controversy about Terri Schiavo, an American woman in a vegetative state (for a decade or more longer than Korp) whose artificial treatment and hydration was ceased following a decision by her husband that was made after numerous court cases which ultimately confirmed his authority to do so. Although Gardner was at pains to state that the actions did not amount to euthanasia (he noted that medical treatment decisions such as this had been authorised by the Supreme Court,. and that euthanasia was unlawful) the raw nerve that the case touched among many people did not stop some of those who either supported or opposed euthanasia characterising it as such. Aftermath Korp died at 2 a.m. on Friday, 5 August 2005, and her funeral mass was held one week later and almost six months to the day after she was found. Forbidden by family to attend the service, Joe Korp invited the media to a private funeral ceremony at his home where he sang \\"Unchained Melody\\" and \\"The Lady in Red\\". That night he contacted his first wife and then a newspaper journalist, telling both that he intended to hang himself in his garage. Both contacted police who rushed to the house to find him standing on a ladder with a noose around his neck while talking on a mobile phone. According to the police report, he was looking at them through the garage window when the ladder tipped over. Police believe he may have been trying to regain his footing when the ladder fell. Surrounding his body were photographs of Korp, football memorabilia, and notes professing his innocence. The media reported that he was on the phone to his solicitor at the time he died and that the coroner's toxicology report indicated an alcohol reading of 0.15.Malcolm Brown Cold Blooded Murder Hachette 2009 Pg 208 - 209 In January 2013, Herman applied for permission to marry fellow inmate Nicole Muscat. On 14 February 2014, Herman was released on parole after serving a little over eight years in the Dame Phyllis Frost maximum-security prison. In popular culture The story was portrayed in the 2006 book The Maria Korp Case: The Woman In The Boot Story by Sunday Herald Sun journalist Carly Crawford. The book was later adapted into a 2010 television movie called Wicked Love: The Maria Korp Story, starring Rebecca Gibney as Maria Korp, Vince Colosimo as Joe Korp, and Maya Stange as Herman. It is narrated by Korp herself, from her point of view, as if from beyond the grave, detailing the events from the Korps' wedding to the beginning of Joe Korp's affair, and its consequences, while postulating the theory that her husband was involved in her death. The story of her death inspired the opera Midnight Son by Gordon Kerry and Louis Nowra, first performed by Victorian Opera in Melbourne in 2012. In April 2018, the story was also covered by Casefile True Crime Podcast.

Robert Quinn, held various senior management and ownership positions in baseball: business manager of the St. Louis Browns, general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, and owner/general manager of both the Boston Red Sox and Boston Braves. John J. Quinn's son, son-in-law and grandson have also been senior baseball executives. Quinn was born in Columbus, Ohio, during the period when his father was the president and business manager of the minor league Columbus Senators. General manager of Braves and Phillies =Boston/Milwaukee Braves (1945‚Äì58)= A graduate of Boston College, Quinn worked with his father in the Red Sox front office, then rejoined J. A. Robert Quinn with Boston's National League franchise from 1936‚Äì45, serving as club treasurer and, later, farm system director. He succeeded his father as the Braves' general manager in 1945, working under the club's new ownership group headed by Lou Perini.Goldman, Steven \\"You Could Look It Up: John Quinn's Reign\\", Baseball Prospectus, 2005.08.24 He served in the GM post through the 1958 season, from the Braves' final seven years in Boston through their highly successful first six years as the Milwaukee Braves, winning the 1948 National League pennant in Boston, and the 1957 World Series and 1958 NL title in Milwaukee. Quinn's 1948 Boston team was anchored by starting pitchers Johnny Sain and Warren Spahn. Sain was acquired by the elder Quinn in a minor league transaction in 1942, and Spahn (a future Hall of Famer and baseball's winningest-all-time left- handed pitcher)National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum official website came up through John Quinn's farm system. Tommy Holmes, the club's star right fielder, had been obtained from the New York Yankees in a December 1941 trade; he was the runner-up in 's National League Most Valuable Player balloting. However, the younger Quinn was instrumental in building the 1948 Braves. He added both young players such as shortstop Alvin Dark, signed in , first baseman Earl Torgeson and pitcher Vern Bickford, and veterans acquired in trades like second baseman Eddie Stanky, third baseman Bob Elliott and left fielder Jeff Heath. Quinn acquired so many supporting pieces from the perennially contending St. Louis Cardinals that his postwar Braves were often called the \\"Cape Cod Cardinals.\\"Neyer, Rob, and Epstein, Eddie, Baseball Dynasties: The Greatest Teams of All Time. New York: W. W. Norton & Cop., 2000, page 176 Quinn also broke the baseball color line in Boston by purchasing the contract of fleet center fielder Sam Jethroe from the Dodgers; as a first-year player with the Braves, Jethroe was selected the National League's Rookie of the Year. Under Quinn, the Braves became the fifth of the then-16 Major League teams to integrate, and the third in the National League. His Milwaukee champions of the 1950s relied heavily on the Braves' productive farm system, which developed Hall of Famers Eddie Mathews and Henry Aaron, All-Star catcher Del Crandall, shortstop Johnny Logan, starting pitcher Bob Buhl and starting outfielders Wes Covington and Bill Bruton, among many others. Quinn also acquired three key contributors via trades: Lew Burdette, the Braves' ace right-handed starting pitcher, who came from the Yankees as a rookie in a late-season transaction for Sain; slugging first baseman Joe Adcock, obtained from the Cincinnati Redlegs in a four-team trade just before spring training in 1953; and veteran second baseman Red Schoendienst, another future Hall of Famer, who was the centerpiece of a major midseason 1957 deal with the New York Giants. The Milwaukee Braves' home attendance shattered National League records during Quinn's tenure, never dipping below 1.749 million fans and exceeding the two-million mark for four straight years (1954‚Äì57).Baseball Almanac =Philadelphia Phillies (1959‚Äì72)= Quinn left the Braves, the defending NL champions, in January 1959 to take the reins of the cellar-dwelling Philadelphia Phillies as general manager. Within five years, Quinn rebuilt the Phillies into contenders. Quinn's reconstruction project produced three more last place finishes (1959‚Äì61) before the Phillies broke the .500 mark in and finished in the first division in . Led by players Quinn signed or acquired via trades‚Äîpitcher (and future Baseball Hall of Famer) Jim Bunning, infielders Dick Allen, Cookie Rojas and Tony Taylor, outfielders Johnny Callison, Tony Gonz√°lez and ex-Brave Covington, and catcher Clay Dalrymple, among others‚Äîhis 1964 Phillies were on the verge of winning the club's third pennant in its long history. But they suffered a nightmarish ten-game losing streak in late September to fall out of the league lead and finish second. Quinn then was faced with a second rebuilding job during the late 1960s. In his final trade, he acquired another future Hall of Fame pitcher, Steve Carlton, from the Cardinals on February 25, 1972. However, the Phillies' continued struggles on the field during the season led to Quinn's replacement as GM by Paul Owens, the club's farm system and scouting director, on June 3.The Pursuit of Pennants: Best 25 GMs in Baseball History Family Quinn represented the second generation in his family's four-generation participation in baseball management. His son Bob was a longtime executive in the game who served as general manager of the Yankees, Cincinnati Reds and San Francisco Giants; another son, Jack, was the owner and general manager of the Hawaii Islanders of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League and also served as GM of the St. Louis Blues franchise in the National Hockey League. His daughter Margo is married to longtime baseball executive Roland Hemond. And a grandson, also named Bob, is the former executive vice president, finance and administration, of the Milwaukee Brewers. John J. Quinn briefly scouted for the Houston Astros after he left Philadelphia. He died at age 68 in Stanton, California, on September 20, 1976.

He attended the public schools of Houston County and Caledonia Academy. After graduating, he obtained his qualification as a school teacher and taught in Wilmington, Minnesota. In 1879, Gronna moved to the Dakota Territory, where he farmed, taught school, and was active in several business ventures. He served as president of Lakota, North Dakota's village and president of Lakota's board of education. A Republican, he was elected to the Dakota Territorial House of Representatives in 1889.

He blamed munition makers for the preparedness movement and World War I and was part of the \\"little group of willful men,\\" who opposed President Woodrow Wilson. In 1919 he was a staunch isolationist who opposed the League of Nations treaty because it further entangled the United States in foreign relationships and limited national decision making.Leonard Schlup, \\"North Dakota Senator Asle J.

National and State conferences are held yearly where policy is submitted and debated by elected delegates and members of Young Labor.  Activities and roles  Young Labor is most active during state and federal elections, campaigning in marginal seats. The youth wing of the party may organise members to door knock an electorate or set up a stand in shopping centres to hand out political party notes. Members are often also asked to 'letterbox' party advertising. Each year Australian Young Labor holds a conference in a capital city. The conference is usually held at a university campus and typically features guest speakers from the ALP. At the conference several positions are elected by delegates chosen from state branches. Fifteen executive positions are also elected. The National Young Labor President is a non-voting representative on the Australian Labor Party National Executive.  Organisation  Each state has its own branch of Young Labor, functioning as a party unit (referred to as New South Wales Young Labor, Victorian Young Labor, etc.).

He was determined to help football's metamorphosis from struggling sport into a multi-million pound industry. \\"I felt football was really a sleeping giant and had a long way to go,\\" Dein said. \\"After seeing how the Americans operated their sport, particularly American football and baseball and basketball, I felt we were light years behind. We had so much more to give as an attraction.\\" In an interview with the Financial Times, Greg Dyke the current Chairman of the FA stresses the central role of David Dein in the creation of the Premier League when he states \\"David Dein was the most revolutionary bloke I've met in football.

G-14 David Dein was appointed President of G14 in October 2006 and used his time at the head of the organisation to try to reduce the tension between clubs and country and develop better relations between clubs and international governing federations such as UEFA and FIFA. At the time several legal disputes between clubs and FIFA and national associations relating to the release of players for international matches were on-going. It led to an agreement on compensation for the release of players for international tournaments.Digger: Dein wants end to club v country furore  Football. The Guardian. Retrieved on 24 January 2017.

He denied that there were ever any discussions held at G14 on developing a so-called \\"super league\\" whereby the leading clubs would compete outside the Champions League format. Activities since leaving Arsenal Since his departure from Arsenal David Dein has continued to remain active on the football scene. He continues to attend all of Arsenal's home matches and is present at most international tournaments as a guest of UEFA and FIFA. He continues to provide his views on all the major issues of interest relating to the future of football around the world; be it in media interviews or at conferences and many other public speaking engagements including at schools across the UK. Topics that he has addressed include foreign-ownership of clubs, club finances and levels of debt within the game, goal-line technology (of which he is a strong advocate), youth development and the development of women's football. In March 2009 he addressed the European Parliament in Brussels calling on FIFA to scrap its proposed 6+5 rule arguing that players should be picked by clubs on the grounds of talent and not nationality. He also called on clubs to be allowed to continue to buy young talent from abroad arguing that it would be wrong to deny the most talented young players the ability to develop in the most suitable environment wherever that may be.Hearing Culture Committee European Parliament 30 March 2009 In April 2015, David Dein was invited to address MBA students at Harvard Business School and share with them his experience of running a modern-day football club. David Dein also regularly speaks at prisons and schools (as part of the \\"Speakers for Schools\\" programme) providing inmates and pupils with his views on motivation and inspiration based on his experience in football. Following a talk he gave in November 2016 the Deputy Head of the school which he addressed was informed by a member of a staff that: A student (male) who has been causing us concern and truanting several lessons went to the house office after the talk this morning. He asked if he could be placed in isolation for a day so that he could work hard and catch up on the work he has missed as a result of truancy. When asked what brought on this sudden change in attitude, he said, 'David Dein's talk. It's made me think that I need to sort myself out and work hard.' Alleged conflict of interest Dein's dual role as director of Arsenal and as a senior member of the Football Association's executive led to accusations of conflicts of interest. In 2005, Chelsea manager Jos√© Mourinho said \\"A person who works in the club should not work in the FA. The FA is the FA and the club is the club\\"; he called on David Dein to resign. Mourinho's complaint related to the league programme apparently favouring Arsenal. In 2004‚Äì05, Arsenal played five of their six league games immediately following Champions League group matches at home, while Chelsea had to play five away. This was not the only row Dein has had with Chelsea: Dein complained about Chelsea \\"tapping up\\" Ashley Cole, which resulted in Cole, Chelsea and Jos√© Mourinho all being fined by the FA. He was later accused of making a \\"covert\\" approach for Gilberto Silva that was similar to Chelsea's approach for Cole, while Gilberto was at Atl√©tico Mineiro. Dein denied this, saying he had made his approach known to Atl√©tico; the president of Mineiro, Alexandre Kall, confirmed Dein's account and said that Arsenal had complied with all the rules. Kall stated \\"I am shocked to hear about the press reports concerning the sale of Gilberto Silva.

Middlesbrough chairman Steve Gibson made similar allegations, He returned to Arsenal Fc on 27 October 2011. but Wenger denied this, saying he had been on FA chief executive Brian Barwick's original longlist, but told him from the outset that he did not want the job, a story later confirmed by the FA.

City Hall (Alcald√≠a) of Mejicanos  History  In 1524, the Spanish conquered and colonized the territory of Cuscatl√°n, now El Salvador. Indigenous friends and aborigines (Tlaxcaltecas, Aztecs, and Acolhuas) from the valley of Anahuac, a Mexican territory, arrived with them. After conquering the land, they settled north of the capital, were known as ‚ÄúMexicans‚Äùand founded three core groups: one group was to the north, which is now San Salvador, where the City of Mejicanos is located, second is Barrio de Sonsonate, and third was Usulut√°n, today Canton Santa Maria. The city‚Äôs first named was ‚ÄúVilla of Mejicanos‚Äù, and it later became the ‚ÄúCity of Mejicanos. On February 7, 1823, General Vicente Filisola following orders of the Mexican Imperial Army, battled against Salvadorian Republic Army, Colonel Antonio Jose Ca√±as, substitute for Commander Manuel Jos√© Arce, who became ill. The Salvadorians were opposing the unconditional territory takeover by the Government of Emperor August√≠n de Iturbide.

Indigenous people PIPIL INDIANS . Panchimalco is known for its indigenous population and its festivities. Together with Izalco, Panchimalco is considered one of the last two remaining bastions of indigenous people or \\"Indians\\" in El Salvador. Villagers still weave and wear colorful native textiles and maintain many indigenous traditions. However, the native language is not one of them. As of the last few years, no Nahuatl speakers remain in Panchimalco. Salvadoran \\"Indians\\" comprised 51.6 percent of the Salvadoran population in the 1769-1798 census, but at current time they are numbered at less than 100,000 in all of El Salvador. The number was greatly reduced when forces loyal to Gen. Maximiliano Hernandez massacred up to 30,000 peasants during the Salvadoran peasant uprising of 1932 known as La Matanza. History Panchimalco was founded by the pre-Columbian Toltec people who may have emigrated to the area following the fall of their empire in Tabasco in what is now Mexico. During the Spanish conquest of the territory, the area was called \\"El Fuerte\\" (the fortress) because of the concave shape of the land that gave the indigenous population an advantage. The Spanish established Panchimalco as a village, and built its famous colonial church, one of the most important historical monuments in El Salvador. Its original construction date, circa 1725, make it the oldest surviving colonial structure in El Salvador. The church, consecrated to the Holy Cross of Rome, and bearing that name (Santa Cruz de Roma), has been damaged in the various earthquakes that have shaken El Salvador through the centuries, beginning with one registered in 1736. The church consists of a single nave covered by a roof supported by 16 wooden beams. It contains an altar reredos done in the French baroque style, but its most well-known feature is its bleached white colonial fa√ßade. Like many colonial churches, it fronts a central square centered on a large cypress tree. The clay floor is not original, but marks a restoration completed in 1970. The church was declared a national historic monument by the Salvadoran congress on February 27, 1975. Culture The festivities held in Panchimalco are colorful and religious in nature. The Flower & Fronds Fair (Feria de las Flores y Palmas) celebrates the Virgin Mary devotion of the local Catholic church. The cofrad√≠as or \\"co-fraternities\\" are civic organizations in support of different church festivals, and they organize the various carnivals and celebrations. The procession of the Holy Cross of Rome is the town's official patronal festival. The dance of the Moors and Christians is an odd vestige of a tradition brought over by the Spaniards, which celebrates a Spanish victory over Muslim invaders during the Dark Ages.

It has a population of 90,896 inhabitants according to the 2007 Census. This makes this municipality twelfth largest in terms of population in El Salvador.  History  According to archeological findings, Tonacatepeque was first founded as a small settlement by the Pipil people in mountains just south of its current location. Under the Pipil people, Tonacatepeque was likely a small, minor chiefdom threatened by possible incursions by the Se√±or√≠o de Cuscatl√°n (Lordship of Cuscatl√°n). During the conquest and settlement of the newly discovered Americas, an order of Franciscan missionaries attempted to convert the indigenous people, establishing a new church. The patron saint of Tonacatepeque under the Franciscan order was San Nicol√°s Obispo de Mira (Saint Nicholas Bishop of Myra). Hence, the burgeoning settlement took on the name San Nicol√°s Tonacatepeque. According to local history, around 1880 the foundations and ruins of that first Franciscan church were still visible. The current location of Tonacatepeque was established in 1560. By 1770, the town had its own established church and included annexed areas such as Soyapango, Ilopango, and the San Jos√© Guayabal Valley. At this point, the town was home to 96 families, comprising 628 people. In 1786, Tonacatepeque was integrated within the jurisdiction of San Salvador. In 1807, following a census done by Intendent Don Antonio Guti√©rrez Ulloa, Tonacatepque was classified as a \\"pueblo\\" or small village, inhabited by 17 Spaniards, 718 natives, and 619 mestizos. Almost seven decades later, on March 7, 1874, the Salvadoran Legislature (under the administration of Field Marshal Santiago Gonz√°lez) authorized the reclassification of Tonacatepeque from \\"pueblo\\" to \\"Villa.\\" The title of City was conferred by legislative decree on February 6, 1878, during the administration of Dr. Rafael Zald√≠var. On March 17, 1892, Tonacatepeque was made District Center by legislative decree under the administration of General Carlos Ezeta. The new administrative district included the populations of Toncatepeque, Apopa, Ilopango, San Mart√≠n, Nejapa, Guazapa, Aguilares, and El Paisnal. Geography and Climate The city of Tonacatepeque is situated on a plateau about 600 meters above sea level. It lies 18 kilometers to the northeast of El Salvador's capital, San Salvador. Generally, the region's climate is cooler and less humid than its surrounding neighbors due to its mountainous location. However, during the months of March and April there can be influxes of heat and humidity. The region's minimum temperature is 22 ¬∞C (71.6 ¬∞F) with a maximum temperature of 28 ¬∞C (82.4 ¬∞F).

The observatory was the result of the 1872 establishment of the National Meteorological Bureau, enacted by President Domingo Sarmiento on an initiative by U.S. astronomer Benjamin Apthorp Gould (who lived in Argentina between 1870 and 1885). The construction of the Observatory was funded by a decree passed by La Plata's founder, Buenos Aires Province Governor Dardo Rocha, on 7 May 1881. In this decree the Engineering Department was ordered to set up plans and a budget for several public buildings, including an astronomical observatory. Designed by the master planner of La Plata, Pedro Benoit, ground was broken on the observatory in November 1883. A year earlier, the Paris Observatory had sent astronomical instruments to the city of Bragado, Buenos Aires, to observe a transit of Venus in front of the Sun, for which the location was particularly suitable, and which raised considerable interest in scientific circles. The first director of the new institution was Francisco Beuf, a lieutenant of the French Army and director of the Naval Observatory of Toulon.

This plantation was visited as early as 1770 by Monsignor Pedro Larras Cortez, a Spanish Archbishop based in Guatemala, when he came on pastoral visits to the country. Subsequent events El Rosario belonged to the department of San Salvador until February 21, 1852, when the Department of La Paz was established and Zacatecoluca was named as the departmental headquarters whose administrative area was now to include the town of El Rosario while still a part of the Olocuilta district. Title of town By Legislative Decree No 486, dated November 18, 1998, El Rosario obtained the title of city, under the administration of Julio Arevalo Diego Bonilla.

His highest-profile role was as Vice- Chancellor of the University of Oxford, but he was also well-known as chairman of the Twenty Committee, which during the Second World War ran the Double- Cross System, controlling double agents in Britain. Academic background Masterman was born in Kingston upon Thames, and educated at the Royal Naval College, Osborne, and Dartmouth, then at Worcester College, Oxford, where he read modern history.Campbell, John P. \\"Masterman, Sir John Cecil (1891‚Äì1977), college head and intelligence officer.\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-31420 In 1914, at the outbreak of the First World War, he was an exchange lecturer at the University of Freiburg, and as a result spent four years interned as an enemy alien in the Ruhleben internment camp. During his internment, Masterman took the opportunity to further polish his German. After his return from captivity, Masterman became a tutor in Modern History at Christ Church, Oxford, where he was also censor (senior tutor) from 1920 to 1926. In the 1920s he became notable as a player of cricket, tennis, and hockey, participating in international competitions, and in 1931 toured Canada with the Marylebone Cricket Club; in Stephen Potter's book Gamesmanship he was acknowledged as a master gamesman. After the Second World War Masterman returned to Oxford, becoming Provost of Worcester College (1946-61) and Vice- Chancellor of the University of Oxford during 1957 and 1958. In 1959 he was knighted for his services to education. Two Oxford mysteries =An Oxford Tragedy= In 1933, he wrote a murder mystery novel entitled An Oxford Tragedy, set in the fictional Oxford college of St. Thomas's. It was written in the point of view of an Oxford don named Francis Wheatley Winn, who was Senior Tutor at St. Thomas'. He served as Watson to the novel's Sherlock Holmes, an amateur sleuth named Ernst Brendel, a Viennese lawyer \\"of European reputation\\". He was giving a series of lectures to the Law Faculty, as he had a good reputation as a detective with the quality of \\"a man to whom secrets will be confided\\". When an unpopular tutor was found shot in the Dean's rooms, he took it upon himself to solve the crime. He of course solved the case, and the murderer thus exposed committed suicide. The novel itself was quite unusual for its time in providing an account of how murder affects the tranquil existence of Oxford dons. While it was a variation of the old theme of evil deeds done in a tranquil setting, it did establish the tradition of Oxford-based crime fiction, notably in the works of Michael Innes and Edmund Crispin. =The Case of the Four Friends= Despite the acclaim that An Oxford Tragedy had garnered, Masterman did not publish a follow-up until 1957. The novel, again starring Ernst Brendel, was called The Case of the Four Friends, which is \\"a diversion in pre-detection\\". In the novel, Brendel is persuaded by a group of friends to relate a story of how he \\"pre-constructed\\" a crime, rather than reconstructing it as in the conventional manner. As he says, \\"To work out the crime before it is committed, to foresee how it will be arranged, and then to prevent it! That's a triumph indeed, and is worth more than all the convictions in the world\\". His tale then was about four men, each of them either a potential victim or potential murderer. The pacing of the story is quite slow and the narrative is interrupted from time to time by discussion between Brendel and his listeners. Even so, the novel maintains its interest on the reader throughout, partly because of the originality of its approach. This novel was the last of his crime stories and he wrote no more works of fiction. However, his best known work was still to come, and it would involve his wartime experiences as part of the Twenty Committee. The Twenty Committee When World War II broke out, Masterman was drafted into the Intelligence Corps. After investigating and producing a report into the evacuation of Dunkirk. Masterman was appointed as a Civil Assistant in MI5. Within MI5 he was the chairman of the Twenty Committee, which was a group of British intelligence officials, including wartime amateurs, who held the key to the Double Cross System, which turned German spies into double agents working for the British. Its name was a pun based on the Roman numeral XX and its double-cross purpose. Strictly speaking, the Committee was responsible for providing information for the agents to be transmitted to the Abwehr and other German intelligence agencies, deceiving them of Allied intentions and war plans. It was Section B1(a) of MI5, established by Lt. Col. T. A. Robertson, who had the task of finding, turning and handling the agents themselves. Masterman became an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in June 1944. Robertson was also appointed an OBE in the same London Gazette. They are both listed as Civil Assistant, War Office. In November 1945 at the Savoy Hotel in London, Masterman and a select few of B1 (a) section were awarded the Order of the Yugoslav Crown by the exiled King Peter II. Although Masterman ran the system, he credited MI5 with originating the idea.John Cecil Masterman, The Double Cross System, Yale, 1972. p. xvi. It is widely assumed that the writer Ian Fleming, himself involved in wartime intelligence, adapted Masterman's name for the (female) character of Jill Masterson in his James Bond novel Goldfinger (1959).Bill Macintyre (2008) For Your Eyes Only: Ian Fleming + James Bond. This was the part played by Shirley Eaton in the 1964 film. In fact Macintyre spells her surname as \\"Masterton\\" (Bloomsbury edition, 2009, at p135). Revelations Information about the double-cross system remained secret after the war. In 1958 Masterman, Introduction by Nigel West - p ix-xxv Masterman began pressing the British intelligence establishment for permission to publish a book about it. Roger Hollis, the head of MI5 at that time, refused to authorize publication, as did Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home. However, Masterman was not to be deterred. Revelations about the Cambridge Spy Ring in the 1960s resulted in low morale throughout the intelligence community, and Masterman felt that the publication of a book about the double- cross system would restore public confidence. He pressed his suit once again on the matter. Masterman also received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1966. In April 1970, when the government again refused, he decided to have it published in the United States, where he felt he would be out of reach of the Official Secrets Act. He was supported by Norman Holmes Pearson, a member of the Yale University faculty, who nominated Yale University Press as publisher. Pearson was more than happy to help Masterman because he also served in the Twenty Committee (though not a member) as the wartime head of the counterintelligence division of the Office of Strategic Services. Yale had contributed many scholars and students to the OSS, and Chester B. Kerr, director of the press, saw the importance of the book historically and commercially. For a time British authorities threatened Masterman with legal action, but in the end bowed to the inevitable and allowed publication, with the proviso that sixty passages in the manuscript be deleted. Kerr would only acquiesce to a dozen. The book, The Double-Cross System in the War of 1939-45, was finally published in February 1972, with a foreword by Pearson, who guardedly did not refer to his work in the Committee. Masterman himself wrote the book without revealing anything about Ultra, still highly secret, that greatly aided the double-cross system. The ban on Ultra would be lifted in 1974.

Zacatecoluca houses many traditional Spanish buildings including the Santa Lucia Catholic Church and used to hold the house where Jos√© Sime√≥n Ca√±as lived, until poor economy due to the many years of war caused the local government to sell the house to a supermarket branch, the house was destroyed and a poorly marked stone on the left of the supermarket entrance is all that is left of Ca√±as' housing legacy. Santa Lucia Catholic Church holds a dear history to the people of Zacatecoluca, as an image of Virgin Mary placed on top is said to have stopped an eruption of lava and ash from completely destroying the city and its local population. On May 11th, 1844, Zacatecoluca received the title of Generous and Loyal City becoming the Departmental Head of La Paz on February 21st, 1852.

It was published by TwoMorrows Publishing and later Top Shelf Productions from 1998‚Äì2005. Its sequel is Comic Book Creator magazine Comic Book Artist in TwoMorrows online shop. Retrieved 2014 September 11. which started publishing in 2013 and is also published by TwoMorrows. Comic Book Artist primarily used lengthy interviews with the artists, writers, editors and publishers who contributed to the indigenous American art form, often featuring the first comprehensive histories of such comics publishers as Warren Publishing, Charlton Comics, Tower Comics, Gold Key Comics, and Harvey Comics, though emphasis was given as well to industry leaders DC Comics and Marvel Comics. History Editor Jon B. Cooke in April 2016 =Founding= Comic Book Artist began publication in 1998 as an offshoot of the magazine The Jack Kirby Collector, flagship periodical of Raleigh, North Carolina's TwoMorrows Publishing. With that periodical devoted to a single comics creator, associate editor Jon B. Cooke proposed a sister magazine devoted to other professionals who contributed to the American comics industry, particularly those who worked between the 1960s and 1980s. The first issue premiered with a Spring 1998 cover date. Most issues are each devoted to a single publisher's comics and the creators responsible within, by way of multiple interviews and oral histories to form overall impressions of a specific era. The first five issues sported a \\"flip-side\\" magazine that revived the fondly remembered 1960s fanzine Alter Ego, founded by Dr. Jerry Bails and devoted to superhero comics. Former Marvel Comics writer and editor- in-chief Roy Thomas, who in the '60s had succeeded Bails as editor and subsequently purchased the magazine's rights, returned as editor of this new version, dubbed Volume Two. In 1999, Alter Ego again became its own magazine, which has continued past 100 issues. The first several issues of Comic Book Artist were collected into three trade paperback volumes that also include new material. = Move to Top Shelf = In 2002, after 25 issues, the magazine and editor-owner Cooke ‚Äì who is also a book designer and layout artist ‚Äì left TwoMorrows for a new publisher, Top Shelf Productions, in Atlanta, Georgia. Comic Book Artist volume two debuted in July 2003 with a redesigned format, square binding, and a color section, \\"Comic Book Artist Classic,\\" that continued the thematic focus of volume one.

This station is owned by Univision Radio, a division of Univision Communications Inc. The station operates at 98.5 MHz with its studios located in Northwest San Antonio and the transmitter site located in the unincorporated Bexar County near Government Canyon Park. Station history KBBT originally launched as country outlet KBOP-FM at 98.3 and licensed to Pleasanton, Texas, in 1968. They later changed call letters to KBUC in 1993 but kept the Country format intact. In 1998 Univision, seeking to tap into a unique Hispanic audience that was non-Spanish speaking, very contemporary and influenced by present-day trends, acquired KBUC and applied for a city of license change to Schertz and a frequency switch to 98.5 to cover the San Antonio Metropolitan area, which was approved in early April 2000. On September 29, 2000, Univision officially launched KBBT, the company's first non-Spanish formatted outlet in San Antonio (outside of bilingual-speaking Tejano sister station KXTN-FM and later on, Active Rock turned Top 40 KLTO), where it shot up to number one in the ratings and has retained that position since its inception. From the beginning, KBBT's musical formula, which started under its first program director, J. D. Gonzalez, has centered on Hip-Hop/R&B; hits, tailor-made for San Antonio and in particular its large mix of teens, females, young adults, and bilingual Hispanic audiences. This formula has also served as the catalyst for the demise of the first KTFM, and later on, KCJZ/KPWT. Another defunct station, KSJL-FM, played hip-hop and R&B; under the urban contemporary format throughout the 1990s until it switched frequencies in 1998 and took a more adult direction as KSJL- AM. In 2002, KBBT launched its own morning show, \\"The Xavier's World Morning Show\\", hosted by Xavier Castro and Biggie Paul. In 2010, KBBT phased in Rhythmic pop tracks, but at the same time continues to stick to its hip- hop/r&b; formula as it faces competition from Top 40/CHR rivals KXXM and a new version of KTFM. It also embraces EDM as well, launching a weekly program that airs late Saturday Night/Sunday Mornings.

The operator gives a SIM card to the customer who inserts it into the mobile device to gain access to the service. There are two types of mobile operators: * a mobile network operator (MNO) which owns the underlying network and spectrum assets required to run the service. * a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) which buys wholesale service from an MNO and sells on to its own customers. (and for years before), the world's largest individual mobile operator by subscribers is China Mobile with over 835 million mobile subscribers.Operation Data ‚Äì Customer Numbers China Mobile Official Site Over 50 mobile operators have over 10 million subscribers each, and over 150 mobile operators had at least one million subscribers by the end of 2009.Source: wireless intelligence In February 2010, there were 4.6 billion mobile subscribers, a number that is estimated to grow. Total mobile‚Äêcellular subscriptions reached almost 6 billion by end 2011, corresponding to a global penetration of 86% . History Prior to 1973, cellular mobile device technology was limited to devices installed in cars and other vehicles.See Amos Joel patent 3,663,762. The first fully automated telephone calling system for vehicles was launched in Sweden in 1960, called MTA (mobile telephone system A). Calls from the car were direct dial, whereas incoming calls required an operator to determine which base station the device was currently at. In 1962, an upgraded version called Mobile System B (MTB) was introduced. In 1971, the MTD version was launched, opening for several different brands of equipment and gaining commercial success.Mingtao Shi, Technology base of mobile cellular operators in Germany and China, page 55 Facts about the Mobile. A Journey through Time The network remained open until 1983 and still had 600 customers when it closed. In 1958, development began on a similar service in the USSR, the Altay system for motorists.The first Russian mobile phone In 1963, the service started in Moscow, and by 1970, was deployed in 30 cities across the USSR. Versions of the Altay system are still in use today as a trunking system in some parts of Russia. In 1959 a private telephone company located in Brewster, Kansas, USA, the S&T; Telephone Company, (still in business today) with the use of Motorola radio telephone equipment and a private tower facility, offered to the public cellular telephone services in that local area of NW Kansas. In 1966, Bulgaria presented the pocket mobile automatic telephone RAT-0,5 combined with a base station RATZ-10 (RATC-10) on Interorgtechnika-66 international exhibition. One base station, connected to one telephone wire line, could serve up to six customers. One of the first successful public commercial mobile phone networks was the ARP network in Finland, launched in 1971. On April 3, 1973, Martin Cooper, a Motorola researcher and executive, made the first analog mobile phone call using a heavy prototype model. He called Dr. Joel S. Engel of Bell Labs. The first commercially automated cellular network (the 1G generation) was launched in Japan by NTT in 1979. The initial launch network covered the full metropolitan area of Tokyo's over 20 million inhabitants with a cellular network of 23 base stations. Within five years, the NTT network had been expanded to cover the whole population of Japan and became the first nationwide 1G network. Several other countries also launched 1G networks in the early 1980s including the UK, Mexico and Canada. In the 1990s, the 'second generation' (2G) mobile phone systems emerged, primarily using the GSM standard. In 1991, the first GSM network (Radiolinja) launched in Finland. American and Canadian wireless providers tend to subsidize phones for consumers but tend to require 2 or 3-year contracts, while Asian and European providers sell the phone at full cost while the monthly fees charged are lower.

Levis, 49, Poet and Professor\\", The New York Times, May 20, 1996 Life and work =Youth and education= Larry Levis was born the son of a grape grower; he grew up driving a tractor, picking grapes, and pruning vines in Selma, California, a small fruit-growing town in the San Joaquin Valley. He later wrote of the farm, the vineyards, and the Mexican migrant workers that he worked alongside. He also remembered hanging out in the local billiards parlor on Selma's East Front Street, across from the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks. Levis earned a bachelor's degree from Fresno State College in 1968, where he studied under Philip Levine. For Levine's classes and poetry workshops, Levis completed many of the poems that would appear in his first book of poems, Wrecking Crew (1972). Levine and Levis formed a lifelong friendship that would, for each of them, leave an indelible mark on their writing and on their art. Both of them continued to exchange poems for critique and consultation, either by mail or in person, during the rest of Levis's life. Levine would go on to edit Levis's posthumously published 1997 volume, Elegy. Next, Levis completed a master's degree from Syracuse University in 1970, where he studied under the guidance of poet Donald Justice. One of Levis's classmates at that time, poet Stephen Dunn, has written about their 1969-70 experience at Syracuse: Finally, Levis earned his Ph.D. from the University of Iowa in 1974. While at Iowa, he renewed his friendship with David St. John, whom he'd first met at Fresno State when both had taken classes with Levine. St John would later edit two of Levis's posthumous publications: The Selected Levis (2000), and The Darkening Trapeze (2016). In his foreword to Elegy, Levine acknowledged St John's guidance while editing that volume for publication in 1997. =Academic career= Levis taught English at the University of Missouri from 1974‚Äì1980. From 1980 to 1992, he taught at the creative writing program at the University of Utah. He was co-editor of Missouri Review, from 1977 to 1980.

His second wife was Marcia Southwick, a fellow poet, whom he married on March 15, 1975. David St. John served as best man. Together the couple had a son, Nicholas Southwick Levis (b.1978). They were together for 10 years, until their marriage ended in divorce. Southwick later married Murray Gell-Mann, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist, in 1992. Awards and recognition By the late 1960s, Levis had written many of the poems which would appear in his first book, Wrecking Crew (1972), which won the 1971 U. S. Award of the International Poetry Forum, and included publication in the Pitt Poetry Series by the University of Pittsburgh Press. The Academy of American Poets named his second book, The Afterlife (1976) as a Lamont Poetry Selection. His third book of poems, The Dollmaker's Ghost, was selected by Stanley Kunitz as the winner of the Open Competition of the National Poetry Series in 1981. Other awards included a YM-YWHA Discovery award, three fellowships in poetry from the National Endowment for the Arts, a Fulbright Fellowship, and a 1982 Guggenheim Fellowship. His poems are featured in American Alphabets: 25 Contemporary Poets (2006) and in many other anthologies.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 5, 1994. In the episode, Mayor Quimby's nephew Freddy is wrongly accused of assaulting a waiter, with Bart being the sole witness to the true course of events. Bart therefore faces the moral dilemma of either allowing a miscarriage of justice, or testifying on Freddy's behalf and facing punishment himself, as it would require him to admit that he had been skipping school and Principal Skinner is on the jury. The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Jeffrey Lynch. The new character Freddy, voiced by Dan Castellaneta, was given the same type of cheekbones and nose as Quimby to make them resemble each other. The episode features cultural references to films such as Westworld, Last Action Hero, and Free Willy, and the fictional characters Huckleberry Finn, Eddie, and Darwin. Actor Arnold Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria Shriver are also referenced in the episode. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 10.1, and was the fifth-highest rated show on the Fox network the week it aired. Plot Mrs. Krabappel announces class will end two hours later than normal because someone has tampered with her classroom's clock. Unbeknownst to her, Bart is the culprit. Upset at being in class longer, Bart forges a note claiming he has a dental appointment so he can skip school. Convinced the note is forged, Principal Skinner chases Bart through Springfield. As Skinner is about to corner him, Bart jumps into a passing convertible car driven by Freddy Quimby, Mayor Quimby's nephew. At lunch, Freddy is served chowder, but he ridicules the waiter for pronouncing chowder with a French accent and demands he say it with a Boston accent. Freddy follows the waiter into the kitchen and apparently beats him up. Bart, hiding under a kitchen table, secretly witnesses the true turn of events. Freddy is charged with assault and battery and put on trial. The whole town seems to believe Freddy is guilty. Bart knows otherwise and confesses to Lisa that he is the only witness who can prove Freddy's innocence. Bart is reluctant to testify because it would be tantamount to admitting that he skipped school, and he dreads Skinner's punishment. At the trial, the jury consists of Homer, Skinner, Moleman, Ned, Helen, Jasper, Patty, Apu and Akira. The waiter hires Lionel Hutz as his attorney. The rest of the jury intends to convict Freddy, but Homer casts the lone dissenting vote, resulting in a deadlock. The jury is sequestered at a hotel with free room service and cable television; Homer's only reason for dissenting is so he can enjoy deluxe accommodations. In court, Lisa convinces Bart to testify. Bart tells the court that Freddy did not assault the waiter; instead the waiter injured himself in a series of clumsy actions. The waiter indignantly denies he is clumsy. Rising to protest, he trips over a chair and falls out the window into an open-roof truck filled with rat traps. When asked how he witnessed the incident when he was supposed to be in class, Bart reluctantly admits he skipped school. Freddy is cleared of all charges. Although Skinner gives Bart detention for the next four months, he praises him for his honesty. After the jury is dismissed, Homer steals everything from the hotel room and puts it in his bedroom. Production \\"The Boy Who Knew Too Much\\" was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Jeffrey Lynch. Executive producer David Mirkin \\"loved\\" that the whole situation of Bart seeing the waiter injure himself and not telling the truth ties together with the Homer plot in that it causes Homer to get jury duty and then only caring about going to the hotel. Mirkin thought it \\"worked really well\\". The new character Freddy was voiced by The Simpsons cast member Dan Castellaneta, who also provides the voice of Mayor Quimby. Freddy was given the same type of cheekbones and nose as Quimby to make them resemble each other. When Bart is fleeing from Skinner, a shot of Bart running down a hill from the season four episode \\"Kamp Krusty\\" was re-used. At the release of season five on DVD, a review described the image as possibly the \\"best the series has ever looked on DVD\\". However, \\"The Boy Who Knew Too Much\\" was one of the few episodes in which technical issues still remained; for example, Bart and Lisa's image was fuzzy toward the beginning, and the episode featured for the last time \\"some of the hand drawn dimensions that would be eliminated once the show switched over to digital compositing and desktop cartoon creation\\". Cultural references Actor Arnold Schwarzenegger and his ex-wife Maria Shriver are parodied in the episode. * While riding on the prison bus, Bart looks out the window and has a dream that features him, Huckleberry Finn and Abraham Lincoln on a raft going down a river in Springfield. Mirkin said Swartzwelder had always enjoyed putting presidents into his jokes, and this was only one of his many references to Lincoln. * The scene of Skinner chasing Bart borrows heavily from the film Westworld, especially the scene with Skinner walking across the river. Director David Silverman said Lynch and his fellow director Brad Bird took \\"a long, hard look\\" at Westworld to make sure the animation in the scenes resembled the film as much as possible. Mirkin said of the Westworld parody: \\"Again, to show you what a collaboration this is, we had the animators looking at Westworld and making sure of the animation, and then we made sure that [The Simpsons composer] Alf Clausen got the brilliant soundtrack from the film. He put in a lot of touches that really made the soundtracks identical.\\" * Bart's claim to film star and recurring character Rainier Wolfcastle (a parody of Arnold Schwarzenegger) that his \\"last movie really sucked\\" and Chief Wiggum's subsequent claim of \\"magic ticket, my ass\\" are in reference to Last Action Hero, a Schwarzenegger film featuring magic tickets that was panned by critics. Additionally, Wolfcastle's wife is named Maria; Schwarzenegger's wife at the time was Maria Shriver. * Creator Matt Groening has a cameo appearance as the court illustrator in the Quimby trial. He can be seen signing his name on his sketch. * During the trial, Bart quips \\"the system works. Just ask Claus von B√ºlow\\". This is a reference to the British socialite who was accused of attempted murder, but was acquitted after two trials. * Of the twelve jurors, Homer is the only one to vote \\"innocent\\", angering the other eleven; the trial ends with Freddy being found innocent. This is a reference to the film 12 Angry Men. * During the trial, Homer sings the jingle of the cat food company Meow Mix in his head. * Jasper, one of the jurors, wants the trial to be over so that he can go home and watch television. He says that tonight \\"the dog from Frasier will ride the dolphin from seaQuest\\". Both Frasier and seaQuest DSV were very popular on NBC, the highest-rated network in the United States for most of the 1990s. * At the hotel, Homer watches a new \\"director's cut\\" of the 1993 family film Free Willy that features Jesse being crushed by the titular whale. Homer is saddened by this, and says, \\"Oh, I don't like this new director's cut!\\" * Homer rooms with Skinner at the hotel, and in a reference to the television series The Odd Couple, Skinner picks up a cigar butt from the floor with his umbrella while cleaning the room, just as Tony Randall does in the opening credits of that series. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"The Boy Who Knew Too Much\\" finished fiftieth in the ratings for the week of May 2‚Äì8, 1994, with a Nielsen rating of 10.1, equivalent to approximately 9.5 million viewing households. It was the fifth highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following Married... with Children, Living Single, Melrose Place and Beverly Hills, 90210. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, praised the episode for containing \\"a memorable guest character in the French waiter Monsieur Lacosse, two great slapstick sequences involving the same, and displays Principal Skinner -- pursuing Bart across the mountains like 'a non- giving-up school guy', and confessing that in some ways he's \\"a small man; a petty, small man\\" -- in particularly fine form.\\" DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson thought Freddy Quimby \\"may well be the most unpleasant character to grace the series -- in an amusing way, though Freddy‚Äôs edginess makes him less amusing than his uncle. It‚Äôs rather startling to see Skinner so rapidly resume his dislike of Bart after the last episode, though. It‚Äôs fun to see his superhuman powers in the pursuit of Bart, and the mystery aspects of the show help make it a very good one. Add to that Homer on jury duty for even more entertainment.\\" Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of A for its \\"excellent bits thrown together to make this one, joke for joke, one of the season's funniest\\". In 2007, Patrick Enright of MSNBC called it his tenth favorite episode of the show. He said it was a perfect example of the show's \\"hilarious randomness\\" because of jokes such as Homer singing the Meow Mix cat food jingle, and the scene in which Homer discovers that if the jury‚Äôs deadlocked, they will be sequestered in a luxury hotel. Homer justifies his decision to be the lone dissenting voice by saying, \\"I‚Äôm only doing what I think is right. I believe Freddy Quimby should walk out of here a free hotel (when he should have said a 'free man').\\" Entertainment.ie named it among the 10 greatest Simpsons episodes of all time.

Cain's novel Love's Lovely Counterfeit. It was directed by Allan Dwan, and its widescreen cinematography was by John Alton. The picture tells the story of Ben Grace (John Payne), a man working for a powerful metropolitan crime boss-- Solly Caspar (Ted de Corsia) -- and their involvement with two sisters (Rhonda Fleming and Arlene Dahl). Plot The ruthless Solly Caspar is fighting to retain control of Bay City's criminal activities when Frank Jansen (Kent Taylor), an honest man and mayoral hopeful, begins a strong anti-crime campaign. Caspar tasks his right-hand man Ben Grace to dig up some dirt on the candidate and ruin his chances of election. Ben follows the candidate's redheaded secretary, June Lyons (Rhonda Fleming), to a jail where she's picking up her equally scarlet-tressed and sexy kleptomaniac sister Dorothy (Arlene Dahl). June is Jansen's girlfriend as well, but their relationship is still only social, and there's nothing to work with--but in the process of following her, Ben has become attracted to June. Ben gives June incriminating evidence about Caspar, who slapped him around for not providing any dirt on June's boss. A tape Ben made proves Caspar killed a crusading newspaperman supporting Jansen, and Caspar is forced to leave the city. Ben takes over the rackets, unbeknownst to June. Meanwhile, her sexually charged sister is attracted to Ben. She makes a play for him at a beach house previously belonging to Caspar and nearly kills Ben by accident with a spear gun. She goes for a swim in a leopard-pattern bathing suit, and afterwards we see them on the sofa, her fully dressed and looking very satisfied, while Ben looks guilty. Learning that he's never taken June there, Dorothy says \\"Score one for little sister\\", and later tells June they had sex. June later confronts Ben about this, and he never responds directly to the accusation, but says it's June he really wants. She wonders if it's really both of them he's after. While Ben and Dorothy are still at the beach house, one of Caspar's men who was jailed because of Ben's information comes after him with a gun, but Ben wounds him‚Äîthen tells him he's the one who bailed him out. When the police arrest Dorothy for stealing a necklace, Ben intervenes on her behalf, making June finally realize that he's not as honest as he seemed. Jansen, who loves June, insists that her sister must go back to jail. Caspar returns for revenge and finds Dorothy alone in the beach house. She throws herself at Caspar and his money, not even minding when June shows up and Caspar decides to murder her. June shoots him with the spear gun, then twice with his own gun. Ben arrives and wants June to go away with him and the money. She refuses. Caspar, not yet dead, wounds Ben, then gathers his men, and comes back to finish the job. Ben gives himself up on condition June and Dorothy won't be hurt, and mocks Caspar, who shoots him several times‚Äînot realizing Ben has called his friend Dietz, the chief of police, and he is just arriving on the scene with a full squad. The police enter the house and arrest Caspar and his men, breaking the gang once and for all. A badly wounded Ben is taken to the hospital, his fate uncertain, and June goes with him, leaving Dorothy with Jansen.

Dwan directed 386 films in his long career and his first work was the silent short Strategy, produced in 1911. =Noir cinematography= According to critic Blake Lucas the film was made with a modest budget, and yet the film is richly colored and well decorated and is one of the best of the Dwan-Alton pictures. Lucas wrote, \\"Alton's imagination in lighting is as distinctive in color as it is in black and white.\\" Alton uses extensive shadows and large black areas, and he accentuates an array of pinks, greens, and especially the color orange. The end result is a startling effect in many of the scenes, all in Technicolor.Silver, Alain and Elizabeth Ward.

Critical reception Bosley Crowther, film critic for The New York Times, was caustic about the casting and the adaptation of Cain's novel, and wrote: \\"Rhonda Fleming and a laughably kittenish Arlene Dahl, are a couple of on-the-make sisters, and the fellow, played by John Payne, is an on-the-make big-time gangster. In the end all their faces are red. So, we say, should be the faces of the people responsible for this film, which is said to have been taken from a novel (unrecognizable) of James M. Cain. For it is an exhausting lot of twaddle about crime and city politics, an honest mayor, his secretary-mistress, her kleptomaniacal sister and the fellow who wants to get control of the gang.Crowther, Bosley.\\" The New York Times, film review, March 17, 1956.

His books have been translated into 16 languages, and he received his doctorate in preaching. Nouthetic counseling According to an interview by Aaron Blumer, Adams' major influence on counseling was the publication of his book Competent to Counsel in 1970. It is from that book that Adams developed what is known as nouthetic counseling. Over time, Adams has become a popular advocate of \\"strictly biblical approaches\\" to counseling, whose \\"perspectives are influencing evangelical Christianity today.\\" John F. MacArthur has stated that through Adams' book Competent to Counsel Adams gave the Church \\"an indispensable corrective to several trends that are eating away at the Church's spiritual vitality\\".. Derek Tidball argues that Adams has made an \\"enormous contribution to the revival of biblical pastoral theology\\".. According to Ian F. Jones, Tim Clinton, and George Ohlschlager, \\"Jay Adams brought a biblical revolution to Christian and pastoral counseling in the 1970s, challenging a field that was racing toward rancor, even dissolution by its fascination with all manner of anti-Christian psycho-babble.\\" David Powlison has said that Adams has written \\"abundant resources for the development of counseling\\" and has led to the establishment of various institutions based on his views. Psychologists have argued that nouthetic counseling can do considerable harm to patients. In addition to techniques which critics consider ineffective, patients who are not helped by nouthetic counseling often consider themselves religious failures. Richard Winter examines the approach of a well-known American author... Further criticism comes from The Baker Encyclopedia of Psychology and Counseling, which states that \\"Adams seems to be not fully knowledgeable regarding the theories he criticizes\\" and that \\"confrontation is also essential to the theory of Adams.\\" However, it does go on to state that this confrontation \\"is defined as caring confrontation.\\" Mark McMinn has argued, however, that \\"Dr. Adams has received a great deal of unfair, uninformed criticism from the Christian counseling community.

He was called \\"The Shakespeare of the Puritans\\" by Robert Southey; while he was a Calvinist in theology, he is not, however, accurately described as a Puritan. He was for a time at Willington, Bedfordshire, and his works may later have been read by John Bunyan.Christopher Hill A Turbulent, Seditious and Factious People: John Bunyan and his Church (1988), p. 25. Life Much of the information about Adams comes from title-pages and dedications in his works. He was educated at the University of Cambridge, graduating B.A. in 1601 and M.A. in 1606. Ordained in 1604, he was a curate at Northill in Bedfordshire, a position he lost. By 1611, he was vicar of Willington. On 21 December 1614 he became vicar of Wingrave, Buckinghamshire, a position he held until 1618. From 1618 to 1623 he held the preachership of St Gregory by St Paul's, and during the same period preached occasionally at St. Paul's Cross and Whitehall. He was 'observant chaplain' to Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester, lord chief justice of England. Incidental references show that he was on intimate terms with William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke and Lord Ellesmere. Montagu was a dedicatee, as was Sir Henry Marten. He was buried on 26 November 1652. Works Early sermons were Heaven and Earth Reconciled, and The Devil's Banquet. To Montagu he dedicated a work in 1618.The Happiness of the Church; or a description of those Spiritual Prerogatives wherewith Christ hath endowed her considered in contemplations upon part of the twelfth chapter to the Hebrews; being the sum of divers sermons preached in St. Gregorie's, London, by Thomas Adams, preacher there. In 1629 he collected into a massive folio his occasional sermons, a collection he dedicated to the parishioners of St Benet Paul's Wharf, and to the Lords Pembroke and Manchester.

The ancient pueblo of Gotera was renamed San Francisco after the parish of the same name. Today the city is referred to as San Francisco Gotera or simply Gotera. Military history Because of the Salvadoran Civil War, part of the park was turned into a military base and the other part was paved. The military base sat unused for several years but was converted into a municipal market in 2002. Today the market is nearly empty because a larger, covered market with running water and trash pick-up was constructed in 2003 two blocks to the east of the old military base. The current military base sits on the banks of the San Francisco River. Today Gotera is the department head and largest municipality in Moraz√°n.

Career After releasing two self-produced EPs in 2000 and 2001, ArnoCorps built a fan following in the San Francisco Bay Area. The band's full length concept album was announced for release in 2005, titled The Greatest Band Of All Time. British metal label Anticulture Records released the album in the UK and Europe in February 2006. After receiving critical praise in British magazines such as Metal Hammer and Total Guitar, along with mainstream radio airplay on BBC Radio 1, ArnoCorps headlined tours of the UK and Ireland. The first tour earned the band a 10 out of 10 rating from the BBC for a performance in Manchester, England, an appearance on commercial radio station Kerrang! 105.2 and a rave review of their London show in the October 2006 issue of Bizarre. In 2008, ArnoCorps was voted \\"Best San Francisco (local) Rock Band\\" by the readers of SF Weekly. The band started a Kickstarter campaign to fund their latest project, The Fantastic EP, which covers the Conan films among other new tracks. Musical style The lyrics of ArnoCorps songs have a particular emphasis on Schwarzenegger's action roles from the 1980s such as The Terminator, Predator and Total Recall, with many of the lyrics retelling movie dialogue and plots, similar to The Misfits' lyrical focus on horror films and B-movies. As a further part of their concept, ArnoCorps make tongue-in-cheek claims of being inspired by ancient folklore and mythology originating from the alps of their \\"native\\" Austria, suggesting that there are actually sociological and philosophical topics being addressed in their lyrics. As part of a publicity stunt, the band accused several Hollywood movie studios with \\"stealing\\" the mythology of Austria for plot material. In 2004, the band attempted to launch a class-action lawsuit against the studios on behalf of the Austrian people, although the case failed to go to court. Live performances The band combines a militaristic appearance with a musical style rooted in skate punk and heavy metal. Describing their music as \\"Action Adventure Hardcore Rock and Roll\\", the focus of the band is on energetic live performances which feature interaction with the audience. Attendees and fans are referred to by the band as \\"Goddamn Heroes and Sheroes.\\" The band's stage show sees all six members dressed in combat fatigues and camouflage paint (inspired by Predator and Commando) and address the audience in \\"ballsy\\" accents. Each band member uses a pseudonym and have heroic backstories. ArnoCorps often performs with two bass players in their line-up (an arrangement they refer to as \\"heroic symmetry\\").

Early life and education  Born in San Antonio, Texas, in 1938 to an Oklahoma family, Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz grew up in Central Oklahoma, daughter of a white sharecropper and a mother that Dunbar believes to have been partially Native American, although her mother never claimed to be Native and Dunbar-Ortiz grew up without any Native heritage. Dunbar's paternal grandfather, a settler of Scots-Irish ancestry, was a landed farmer, veterinarian, a labor activist and a Socialist Party member in Oklahoma and also a member of the Industrial Workers of the World, \\"Wobblies\\". Her father was named after the leaders of the Industrial Workers of the World‚ÄîMoyer Haywood Pettibone Scarberry Dunbar. Her father's stories of her grandfather inspired her to lifelong social justice activism.Dunbar-Ortiz, Roxanne. Red Dirt: Growing Up Okie, University of Oklahoma Press, 2006 Married at 18, she and her husband moved to San Francisco three years later, where she has lived most of the years since, although the marriage ended. Her account of life up to leaving Oklahoma is recorded in Red Dirt: Growing Up Okie. She has a daughter Michelle. She later married writer Simon J. Ortiz. Dunbar-Ortiz graduated from San Francisco State College in 1963, majoring in History. She began graduate study in the Department of History at the University of California, Berkeley but transferred to the University of California, Los Angeles completing her doctorate in history in 1974. In addition to the doctorate, she completed the Dipl√¥me of the International Law of Human Rights at the International Institute of Human Rights, Strasbourg, France in 1983 and an MFA in Creative Writing at Mills College in 1993.  Activism  From 1967 to 1974, she was a full-time activist living in various parts of the United States, traveling to Europe, Mexico, and Cuba. She is also a veteran of the women's liberation movement. Outlaw Woman: Memoir of the War Years outlines this time of her life, chronicling the years 1960‚Äì1975. She contributed the piece \\"Female liberation as the basis for social revolution\\" to the 1970 anthology Sisterhood is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings From The Women's Liberation Movement, edited by Robin Morgan. In 1974, she accepted a position as assistant professor in the newly established Native American Studies program at California State University at Hayward, where she helped develop the departments of Ethnic Studies and Women's Studies. In the wake of the Wounded Knee Siege of 1973, she became active in the American Indian Movement (AIM) and the International Indian Treaty Council, beginning a lifelong commitment to Indigenous peoples' right to self-determination and to international human rights. Her first book, The Great Sioux Nation: An Oral History of the Sioux Nation and its Struggle for Sovereignty, was published in 1977 and presented as the fundamental document at the first international conference on Indians of the Americas, held at United Nations' headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. The book was issued in a new edition by University of Nebraska Press in 2013. It was followed by two other books: Roots of Resistance: A History of Land Tenure in New Mexico (1980) and Indians of the Americas: Human Rights and Self-Determination (1984). She also edited two anthologies on Native American economic development, while heading the Institute for Native American Development at the University of New Mexico. In 1981, Dunbar-Ortiz was asked to visit Sandinista Nicaragua to appraise the land tenure situation of the Miskito Indians in the northeastern region of the country. Her two trips there that year coincided with the beginning of United States government's sponsorship of a proxy war to overthrow the Sandinistas, with the northeastern region on the border with Honduras becoming a war zone and the basis for extensive propaganda carried out by the Reagan administration against the Sandinistas. In over a hundred trips to Nicaragua and Honduras from 1981 to 1989, she monitored what was called the Contra War. She tells of these years in Caught in the Crossfire: The Miskitu Indians of Nicaragua (1985) and Blood on the Border: A Memoir of the Contra War (2005). In her work An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States, Dunbar-Ortiz condemns the Discovery Doctrine and the settler colonialism that devastated Native American populations in the United States. She compares this form of religious bigotry to the modern-day conquests of al-Qaeda. She states that with much of the current land within the United States was taken by aggression and oppression, \\"Native peoples have vast claims to reparations and restitution,\\" yet \\"[n]o monetary amount can compensate for lands illegally seized, particularly those sacred lands necessary for Indigenous peoples to regain social coherence.\\" She is featured in the feminist history film She's Beautiful When She's Angry. She is Professor Emerita of Ethnic Studies at California State University, Hayward. Since retiring from university teaching, she has been lecturing widely and writing.

Ignace Mentour was the key aboriginal guide through this region during Fleming's 1872 railway survey, recorded in George Monro Grant's journal of the survey, Ocean to Ocean. Mentour had also served with Sir George Simpson in Simpson's final years as governor of Rupert's Land. During Ignace's early days, there was a settlement of railway boxcars used by the English residents there called \\"Little England.\\" Although Ignace was incorporated in 1908, it was something of a latecomer to some modern conveniences, such as rotary dial telephone, which did not arrive to the town until 1956. Forestry and tourism support Ignace's economy, today, and one attraction is the 3-storey log White Otter Castle, located on White Otter Lake at Turtle River, and built by James Alexander McOuat between 1903 and 1914.

The Fury name was moved to Plymouth's mid-size models for 1975, at which time the Satellite name was discontinued.  First Generation (1965-1967)  When the new, larger Plymouth Fury was introduced for 1965 on Chrysler's full-size C platform, the Plymouth Belvedere name was moved to Plymouth's \\"new\\" mid-size line for 1965. The Belvedere Satellite was the top trim model in the series, above the Belvedere I and II. It was only available as a two-door hardtop or convertible. Bucket seats and center console were standard, as well as a V8 engine. For 1965, the standard engine was the with optional , , as well as and Commando\\" engines. This 426 had the wedge combustion chamber design and is not the 426 \\"Hemi\\" that was offered in 1966. The front end featured single headlights on each side, and a grille divided into four thin rectangles laid horizontally. The 1965 Satellite two- door hardtop total production was 23,341 units. It weighed with a base price of $2,612. Convertible production was 1,860 units. It weighed and was priced at $2,827 in standard trim. The 1966 redesigned Satellite was available with a \\"Street Hemi\\" engine with two 4-barrel carburetors and 10.25:1 compression. This engine was rated at at 5,000 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm. The other V8 engine options for 1966 remained the 273, the 318 at , as well as the Commando 361 and Commando 383 at , down from its rating in 1965. The 1967 Satellite was a carryover from 1966, but there were several trim changes. A new grille featured dual side-by-side headlights, a change in the rear trunk finish panel and taillights included multiple horizontal ribs. New horizontal aluminum trim at the lower body crease with lower silver paint gave all 1967 Satellites essentially a two-tone paint scheme. For 1966 and 1967, the interior vinyl seats and door panels were treated to a unique 'Western Scroll' design which mimicked tooled leather in appearance. This was the 'premium' interior shared with the GTX in 1967. For 1966 and 1967 the Satellite was again offered only in 2-door hardtop and convertible models and was powered by V8 engines. The 361 was discontinued for the 1967 models, but a 2-barrel 383 producing was optional, as well as 4-barrel version rated at .

The Sport Satellite received the same blacked- out grille with horizontal blades as used on the Road Runner whereas the regular Satellite shared its grille with Belvederes. A 4-door sedan and station wagon were offered on the Satellite line for the first time. There were no Sport Satellite sedans in 1968, but, confusingly, a Satellite Sport Wagon could be had. These had Sport Satellite trim and also woodgrain panels outside.Lee, p. 407 A Sport Satellite four-door sedan was added to the lineup in 1969, and the wagons became a part of the regular Sport Satellite line.Lee, p. 408 The 1968 model year was also the introduction of the Plymouth Road Runner that shared the same body as the Satellite and Belvedere models. The 1968 body continued through 1970, with new grilles in 1969 and a minor front and rear restyling for 1970, which was the last year for the Belvedere name.

The Satellite adopted new \\"fuselage\\" styling - in line with the facelifts on the larger Chrysler C-Body models - on the two-door, four-door, and wagon models. Unlike previous years, 4-door sedans and 2-door coupes did not share sheet metal and each carried unique styling. Sedans were available in base, Custom, and Brougham trim, while two-doors were available in base trim (with rear windows that did not roll down), Sebring trim, and Sebring Plus trim. Station wagons were available in base, Custom, or wood-trimmed Regent models. Two-door models had a loop-type front bumper, and this body was the basis for the related GTX and Roadrunner models. 2-door coupes had a wheelbase of 115 inches, while 4-door sedans, as well as station wagons, had a wheelbase of 117 inches For the 1973 model year, the two-door models - including the Sebring - received a more conventional front end design, with squared up sheet metal and rear side windows. Safety requirements for the 1974 model year included bumpers for the sedans and wagons. The Satellite name was dropped after 1974, after which Plymouth's intermediate offerings on the B-body chassis took the Plymouth Fury name. The Satellite Sebring was replaced by the Chrysler Cordoba (a car which was originally intended to be called Plymouth Sebring) and shared an all-new body with the Dodge Charger. The Sebring name would be revived by Chrysler on an unrelated model in 1995.

The Samara culture is regarded as related to contemporaneous or subsequent prehistoric cultures of the Pontic-Caspian steppe, such as the Khvalynsk, Repin and Yamna (or Yamnaya) cultures. The Proto-Indo-European homeland is often linked to one or more of these cultures. Archaeological site The Samara culture was an eneolithic culture of the early 5th millennium BC at the Samara bend region of the middle Volga, at the northern edge of the steppe zone. It was discovered during archaeological excavations in 1973 near the village of Syezzheye (–°—ä–µ–∑–∂–µ–µ) in Russia. Related sites are Varfolomievka on the Volga (5500 BC), which was part of the North Caspian culture, and Mykol'ske, on the Dnieper. The later stages of the Samara culture are contemporaneous with its successor culture in the region, the early Khvalynsk culture (4700‚Äì3800 BC), while the archaeological findings seem related to those of the Dniepr-Donets II culture (5200/5000‚Äì4400/4200 BC). The valley of the Samara river contains sites from subsequent cultures as well, which are descriptively termed \\"Samara cultures\\" or \\"Samara valley cultures\\". Some of these sites are currently under excavation. \\"The Samara culture\\" as a proper name, however, is reserved for the early eneolithic of the region. Artifacts =Pottery= Pottery consists mainly of egg-shaped beakers with pronounced rims. They were not able to stand on a flat surface, suggesting that some method of supporting or carrying must have been in use, perhaps basketry or slings, for which the rims would have been a useful point of support. The carrier slung the pots over the shoulder or onto an animal. Decoration consists of circumferential motifs: lines, bands, zig-zags or wavy lines, incised, stabbed or impressed with a comb. These patterns are best understood when seen from the top. They appear then to be a solar motif, with the mouth of the pot as the sun. Later developments of this theme show that in fact the sun is being represented. =Sacrificial objects= The culture is characterized by the remains of animal sacrifice, which occur over most of the sites. There is no indisputable evidence of riding, but there were horse burials, the earliest in the Old World. Typically the head and hooves of cattle, sheep, and horses are placed in shallow bowls over the human grave, smothered with ochre. Some have seen the beginning of the horse sacrifice in these remains, but this interpretation has not been more definitely substantiated. We know that the Indo-Europeans sacrificed both animals and people, like many other cultures. =Graves= The graves found are shallow pits for single individuals, but two or three individuals might be placed there. A male buried at Lebyazhinka approximately 7,000 years BP and often referred to by scholars of archaeogenetics as the \\"Samara hunter-gatherer\\" (a.k.a. I0124; SVP44; M340431), appears to have carried the rare Y-DNA haplogroup R1b1* (R-L278*). Some of the graves are covered with a stone cairn or a low earthen mound, the very first predecessor of the kurgan. The later, fully developed kurgan was a hill on which the deceased chief might ascend to the sky god, but whether these early mounds had that significance is doubtful. Grave offerings included ornaments depicting horses. The graves also had an overburden of horse remains; it cannot yet be determined decisively if these horses were domesticated and ridden or not, but they were certainly used as a meat-animal. Most controversial are bone plaques of horses or double oxen heads, which were pierced. The graves yield well-made daggers of flint and bone, placed at the arm or head of the deceased, one in the grave of a small boy. Weapons in the graves of children are common later. Other weapons are bone spearheads and flint arrowheads. Other carved bone figurines and pendants were found in the graves. Genetics A November 2015 study published in Nature included an analysis of a male hunter-gatherer from Lebyanzhinka, Samara Oblast who lived ca. 5650-5540 BC. He was found to be carrying haplogroup R1b1a1a and U5a1d. Notes References Sources * * Marija Gimbutas, \\"The Civilization of the Goddess\\", HarperSanFrancisco, 1991, or * J. P.

He provided official sanction and legal grounds for a series of actions under the governments of Franz von Papen, Kurt von Schleicher and Hitler from 1932 until his death in 1941.  Biography  =Early life and career= G√ºrtner was the son of Franz G√ºrtner (locomotive engineer) and Marie G√ºrtner, n√©e Weinzierl. After the graduating from the gymnasium in 1900 in Regensburg, he studied law at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. After eight semesters he passed in 1904 his university examination. His preparation for Bavarian civil service was interrupted for the military service in the K√∂niglich Bayerisches 11. Infanterie-Regiment \\"von der Tann\\". After passing his second Staatsexamen in 1908 he worked as syndic for a Munich brewery association. On 1 October 1909, he entered the higher civil service of the Bavarian ministry of justice.Reichshandbuch der deutschen Gesellschaft. Band I, Deutscher Wirtschaftsverlag, Berlin 1930, S. 398. On 7 August 1914 G√ºrtner was drafted as a reserve officer for military service in First World War. He served with the 11th Infantry Regiment on the Western Front. He rose to deputy battalion commander and received the Iron Cross II and I. Class and the Military Merit Order (Bavaria) IV class with swords. From September 1917 he took part with the Bavarian Infantry Battalion 702 (as Expeditionary Force) in the campaign in Palestine region of the Ottoman Empire. Therefore, he received the House Order of Hohenzollern with swords and the Gallipoli Star. His appointment as battalion commander on 31 October 1918 was the day of the surrender of the Ottoman Empire. He led the battalion back to Constantinople (modern Istanbul, Turkey) and arrived on 17 March 1919 in Wilhelmshaven, where he was demobilized. After the war, G√ºrtner pursued a successful legal career, being appointed Bavarian Minister of Justice on 8 November 1922, a position he held until 1932. Through a Roman Catholic, G√ºrtner joined the largely Protestant German National People's Party (Deutschnationale Volkspartei, DNVP), which was unusual as German Catholics usually supported the Centre Party or its Bavarian counterpart, the Bavarian People's Party. However, G√ºrtner was a staunch conservative and nationalist who rejected the Weimar Republic, as he associated democracy with \\"weakness\\", which led him into the radical conservative DNVP. G√ºrtner's nationalist sympathies made him sympathetic to right-wing extremists such as Hitler. During the 1924 Beer Hall Putsch trial, Hitler was allowed to interrupt the proceedings as often as he wished, to cross-examine witnesses at will, and to speak on his own behalf at almost any length.William Shirer, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich Touchstone Edition, New York: Simon & Schuster, 1990 G√ºrtner obtained Hitler's early release from Landsberg Prison, and later persuaded the Bavarian government to legalize the banned NSDAP, and allow Hitler to speak again in public. =Minister of Justice= On 2 June 1932, G√ºrtner was nominated as Reich Minister of Justice under Chancellor Franz von Papen. After serving in the cabinets of Papen and Kurt von Schleicher, G√ºrtner was retained by Hitler in his post, and made responsible for coordinating jurisprudence in the Third Reich. Although G√ºrtner was not a Nazi, he shared the increasingly authoritarian bent of most of his DNVP colleagues. He fully supported the Reichstag Fire Decree, which effectively wiped out civil liberties in Germany. Indeed, on the day before the Reichstag fire, he proposed a bill that was almost as heavy-handed as the Reichstag Fire Decree; it would have instituted severe restrictions on civil liberties under the pretense of keeping the Communists from launching a general strike. He also merged the German judges' association with the new National Socialist Lawyers Association (Nationalsozialistischer Rechtswahrerbund), and provided a veil of constitutional legality for the Nazi State.Austin Cline, \\"When National Interests Take Precedence Over the Rule of Law\\" (PDF) Website on the rule of law. Retrieved 12 May 2010 At first, G√ºrtner also tried to protect the independence of the judiciary and at least a facade of legal norms. He sought to curb the SA and SS' growing tendency to engage in extrajudicial punishments. Although no democrat, G√ºrtner believed in the rechtsstaat (\\"law state\\"), and sought to protect the turf of his ministry. He was most insistent that only the courts could inflict punishments on opponents of the Nazi regime. The ill-treatment of prisoners at concentration camps in Wuppertal (Kemna), Bredow and Hohnstein (in Saxony), under the jurisdiction of local SA leaders, provoked a sharp protest from the Ministry of Justice. G√ºrtner observed that prisoners were being beaten to the point of unconsciousness with whips and blunt instruments, commenting that such treatment In 1933, G√ºrtner came into conflict with one of his subordinates, Roland Freisler, over the issues of Rassenschande (literally: \\"racial disgrace\\"), or sexual relationship between an \\"Aryan\\" and a \\"non-Aryan\\", which Freisler wanted immediately criminalized.Claudia Koonz, The Nazi Conscience, p. 173 G√ºrtner, in a meeting, pointed out many practical difficulties with Freisler's proposal.Claudia Koonz, The Nazi Conscience, pp. 175‚Äì6 This did not, however, stop the passage of the Nuremberg Laws two years later, criminalizing Rassenschande. In the weeks following the Night of the Long Knives, a purge of SA officers and conservative critics of the regime that resulted in perhaps hundreds of executions, he demonstrated his loyalty to the Nazi regime by writing a law that added a legal veneer to the purge. Signed into law by both Hitler and Minister of the Interior Wilhelm Frick, the \\"Law Regarding Measures of State Self-Defense\\" retrospectively legalized the murders committed during the purge. G√ºrtner even quashed some initial efforts by local prosecutors to take legal action against those who carried out the murders.Evans (2005), p. 72. \\"After the 'Night of the Long Knives,' [Reich Minister for Justice Franz G√ºrtner] nipped in the bud the attempts of some local state prosecutors to initiate proceedings against the killers.\\" As a part of bid to retain a role for the judiciary in the repression of enemies of the state and to protect the rechtsstaat, G√ºrtner opened the first session of the People's Court on 14 July 1934. The People's Court was a special court for trying those accused of being enemies of the state, whose procedures were meant to ensure the conviction of the accused. Starting in 1933, G√ºrtner found himself uneasily attempting to maintain the rule of law in Germany by bending the rules of the laws to suit Hitler, a process that steadily involved him and the rest of the German judiciary into excusing and justifying terror. In July 1935, G√ºrtner amended Paragraph 175 of the German penal code to extend its scope and increased the penalties. By the end of 1935, it was already apparent that neither G√ºrtner nor Frick would be able to impose limitations on the power of the Gestapo, or control the SS camps where thousands of detainees were being held without judicial review.Charles W. Sydnor, Jr., Soldiers of destruction: the SS Death's Head Division, 1933‚Äì1945 See footnote, p. 20. Princeton University Press (1977) \\"Concentration Camps 1933‚Äì1939\\" United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, official website. Retrieved 13 May 2010 During World War II, the feeble protestation of the Ministry of Justice was weakened still further, as alleged criminals were increasingly handled by the Gestapo and SS, without recourse to any court of law. Instead of resigning, G√ºrtner stayed on, even going as far as joining the Nazi Party in 1937. He provided official sanction and legal grounds for a series of repressive actions, beginning with the institution of St√§ndegerichte (drumhead courts-martial) that tried Poles and Jews in the occupied eastern territories, and later for decrees that opened the way for implementing the Final Solution. A district judge and member of the Confessing Church, Lothar Kreyssig, wrote to G√ºrtner protesting (correctly) that the T4 program was illegal (since no law or formal decree from Hitler had authorised it); G√ºrtner promptly dismissed Kreyssig from his post, telling him, \\"If you cannot recognise the will of the F√ºhrer as a source of law, then you cannot remain a judge.\\"Kershaw, II, 254 G√ºrtner died on 29 January 1941 in Berlin.

Early life Gray was born in Liverpool in 1913. The only son of Thomas and Ethel Gray of Thornton, he was educated at Ampleforth College in Yorkshire. At the age of 18, he joined the order of monks at the Benedictine college of Ampleforth, but after two months it became clear that this was not the vocation for him and he returned to Liverpool to pursue medicine, qualifying in 1937. Professional life He began a career in General Practice, giving anaesthetics for his patients when they needed surgery. Anaesthesia became his main interest, and he gained a Diploma in Anaesthetics in 1941. He developed an extensive practice in the leading local hospitals, before joining the Royal Army Medical Corps. He was posted to a mobile neurosurgical unit in Oxford, and later to North Africa. Returning to Liverpool University in 1947 as Reader, he established the Department of Anaesthesia, and introduced tubocurarine with mechanical lung ventilation. This became known as the ‚ÄòLiverpool technique‚Äô, based on the triad of unconsciousness, analgesia and muscle relaxation, with a markedly lower complication rate than deep inhalational anaesthesia. Gray introduced train- of-four monitoring, still used today. He also worked with Gordon Jackson Rees at Liverpool, developing safer methods for paediatric anaesthesia. Cecil Gray made a great contribution to postgraduate education, organising the first \\"day-release\\" course in Britain for junior anaesthetists preparing for their examinations. The course attracted trainees from all over Europe, the Far East, the Middle East, Australia, Africa and India. Honours A foundation member of Faculty of Anaesthetists of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1948, he served as vice-dean in 1952 and dean in 1964. Gray was the editor of the British Journal of Anaesthesia from 1948 to 1964. He was President of the Section of Anaesthetics of the Royal Society of Medicine in 1955 and the first anaesthetist to be awarded the Sir Arthur Sims Commonwealth Travelling Fellowship by the RCS (England). An active council member of the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland, Gray served as treasurer and as president (1957‚Äì1959). In 1959, he was awarded a personal chair in anaesthesia at the University of Liverpool and was made Dean of the Faculty of Medicine in 1970, retiring in 1976, but continued to give occasional lectures. Gray was appointed CBE in 1976 by Her Majesty Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and in 1982 was honoured by Pope John Paul II with the membership of the Order of St. Gregory the Great as a Knight Commander. In 2007 the Liverpool Echo included him in its list of the 800 greatest Liverpudlians, as part of Liverpool's 800th anniversary. Private life He married twice, his first wife was Marjorie Kathleen Hely in 1937, they had 2 children, and she died in 1978. He then married Pamela Mary Corning in 1979, with whom he had 1 son.

It stars Catherine Mary Stewart, Robert Beltran, and Kelli Maroney as survivors of a comet that has turned most people into either dust or zombies. Night of the Comet grossed $14.4 million in the US on a $700,000 budget. It has a Rotten Tomatoes approval rating of 77% and has since become a cult film, influencing the creation of Buffy Summers.  Plot  The Earth is passing through the tail of a comet, an event which has not occurred in 65 million years and coincided with the extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs. On the night of the comet's passage, which takes place eleven days before Christmas, large crowds gather outside to watch and celebrate. 18-year-old Regina \\"Reggie\\" Belmont works at a movie theater in southern California. She is annoyed to find the initials DMK have the sixth highest score on the theater's Tempest video game, on which all the other scores are hers. She stays after the theater closes to assist her boyfriend Larry, the theatre‚Äôs projectionist to sneak back in so he can loan out a film reel for illegal duplication for his own profit. He offers to pay for her assistance from what he expects to earn when the other party returns the film reel in the morning. Reggie and Larry spend the night in the steel-lined projection booth and have sex. Meanwhile, Reggie's 16-year-old sister Samantha \\"Sam\\" argues with their stepmother Doris, who Sam implies is cheating on her father. It is revealed during the argument that Sam and Reggie‚Äôs father is away on active military duty. Doris, upset by Sam‚Äôs accusation, slaps her in the face. Sam retaliates and slaps Doris back. Doris then punches Sam in the face sending her flying over the couch and onto the floor. Sam ultimately spends the night in a steel backyard shed. The next morning, a gloomy reddish haze covers the sky and there are no signs of life but piles of red dust and heaps of clothing everywhere. Unaware that anything has occurred, Larry goes outside and is killed by a zombie wielding a pipe wrench. After playing the video game to replace DMK‚Äôs initials with her own, Reggie goes looking for Larry outside, mistaking the red overcast sky as bad smog. She quickly encounters the zombie, but escapes on Larry‚Äôs motorcycle. She heads home to find her sister and they surmise that because they both spent the night in steel containers, they were saved from the comet's effects. The sisters race to the local radio station after they hear a disc jockey on air, only to find it was a pre-recorded show. They come across another survivor there, Hector Gomez, who spent the night in the back of his steel truck. When Sam talks into the microphone, she is heard by researchers in an underground installation out in the desert. As they listen to Reggie, Sam and Hector debate what to do, the scientists note that the zombies, though less exposed to the comet, will eventually disintegrate into dust themselves. Hector leaves to check if any of his family survived, but promises to return as soon as possible. Reggie and Sam then go shopping for guns and clothing at a mall. After a firefight with some zombie stock boys, the girls are taken prisoner, but are saved by a rescue team sent by the scientists. Reggie is taken back to their base. Audrey White, a disillusioned scientist, offers to dispose of Sam, who she diagnosed as having been exposed to the comet due to her developing rash and to wait for Hector to return. After she fakes euthanizing Sam by injecting her with only a sedative, she kills the other remaining scientist. When Hector returns after an encounter with a zombie child, Audrey briefs him on the situation and then gives herself a lethal injection. Sam and Hector set out to rescue Reggie. Back at the base it is revealed that the researchers had suspected and prepared for the comet's effects, but inadvertently left the ventilation system open and the fans running during the comet's passage. This allowed the deadly dust to permeate their base. Reggie has become suspicious, escapes, and discovers that the dying scientists have hunted down and rendered healthy survivors brain-dead. They harvest their untainted blood to keep the disease at bay while they search desperately for a cure. Reggie saves a young boy and a girl before they are processed, then unplugs the other victims from their life support machines. Sam and Hector arrive and rescue the trio and blow up the scientists. Eventually, rain washes away the red dust, leaving the sky clear. After Reggie pairs up with Hector, and takes parental roles with the kids, Sam feels left out. Frustrated, she ignores Reggie's warning about crossing a deserted downtown street against the still-operating signal light, claiming there isn't anyone else left Sam is almost run over by a sports car driven by Danny Mason Keener, a survivor about her own age. After apologizing, he invites her to go for a ride. As they drive off, the car is shown sporting the initials \\"DMK\\" on the vanity plate.

Roth as Willy * Dick Rude and Chris Pedersen as Stockboys * Marc Poppel as Danny Mason Keener / DMK Production When writing the script, director Thom Eberhardt wanted to merge the idea of strong female protagonists with his love of post-apocalyptic films set in empty cities. For the women, he was inspired by Ginger Rogers. Further inspiration came from real-life teenage girls whom he met while filming PBS specials. Without telling the girls details about the script's premise, he asked them to describe how they would react to an apocalyptic event. The girls saw the scenario as an exciting adventure and only saw a downside to the experience when Eberhardt brought up the subject of dating. Using their answers, Eberhardt wrote the script to be lighthearted and adventuresome. Eberhardt initially had trouble convincing the studio to let him direct it, but they relented when he held out, as Atlantic Releasing Corporation was looking to immediately invest $700,000. Atlantic also wanted to capitalize on the success of their 1983 hit Valley Girl and the popularity of quirky drive-in films like Repo Man. The producers, Andrew Lane and Wayne Crawford, clashed with Eberhardt during filming; Eberhardt would later say that they did not understand the film and resented being assigned to such a low-budget B movie. Early in the production, they attempted to have him replaced. Regardless, Eberhardt praised their producing skill and said the film could not have been made without their help. Heather Langenkamp auditioned for the role of Samantha \\"Sam\\" Belmont and was the number one choice on the casting list but the part ultimately went to Kelli Maroney. Release Atlantic released Night of the Comet in the US on November 16, 1984, earning $3,580,578 in its opening weekend, coming in at third place. It stayed in theaters for six weeks and grossed $14,418,922 total in the US. The film is also noted as one of the first mainstream films to carry the MPAA PG-13 rating. =Critical response= On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Night of the Comet holds a 78% approval rating based on 32 critic reviews, with an average rating of 6.44/10. The consensus reads: \\"Valley Girl culture satire Night of the Comet gets lots of mileage out of its slapstick sci-fi zombie approach.‚Äù Variety wrote that Eberhardt \\"creates a visually arresting B-picture in the neon-primary colors of the cult hit Liquid Sky as well as pointing similarities with Five, The Day of the Triffids, The Omega Man, Dawn of the Dead and Last Woman on Earth. They described the film as \\"a successful pastiche of numerous science fiction films, executed with an entertaining, tongue-in-cheek flair that compensates for its absence in originality.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times called it \\"a good-natured, end-of-the-world B-movie\\" whose \\"humor augments rather than upstages the mechanics of the melodrama\\". Author Neil Gaiman wrote in 1985 that the film was \\"one of the most amusing, witty, imaginative, and thought-provoking films I've seen that was made with no budget and is also cheap exploitation.\\" =Home media= Night of the Comet was released on VHS cassettes and CED Videodisc on August 30, 1985, and distributed by CBS/FOX Video.

His most famous work, possibly the only genuine survival, is the Thirteen Emperors Scroll.Loehr, 32-34 He also painted the Portraits at Lingyan Pavilion, under Emperor Taizong of Tang, commissioned in 643 to commemorate 24 of the greatest contributors to Emperor Taizong's reign, as well as 18 portraits commemorating the 18 great scholars who served Emperor Taizong when he was the Prince of Qin. Yan's paintings included painted portraits of various Chinese emperors from the Han Dynasty (202 BC‚Äì220 AD) up until the Sui Dynasty (581‚Äì618) period. His works were highly regarded by the Tang writers Zhu Jingxuan and Zhang Yanyuan, who noted his paintings were \\"works among the glories of all times\\".Fong (1984), 38. From the years 669 to 673, Yan Liben also served as a chancellor under Emperor Taizong's son Emperor Gaozong (r. 649‚Äì683). reliefs of the six favourite horses at the mausoleum of Emperor Taizong (d. 649), very likely after a drawing by Yan Liben A record of 1120 gives 42 titles of his paintings, though the Thirteen Emperors Scroll is not among them. Only four Buddhist subjects are listed, against 12 Daoist. The remainder are portraits, \\"gods of the planets and constellations\\" or records of events at court. Of the surviving works attributed to him, the Thirteen Emperors Scroll is \\"the first that is generally accepted as being partly original\\", though much of it seems later.Loehr, 33-34 (34 quoted) A similar figure of an emperor in fresco in the Mogao Caves (Cave 200), might be by the same hand, and carries the appropriate date of 642.Loehr, 36 By tradition the reliefs of the six favourite horses at the mausoleum of Emperor Taizong (d. 649) were designed by him, and the relief is so flat and linear that it seems likely they were carved after drawings or paintings.Sullivan, Michael, The Arts of China, 126, 1973, Sphere Books, (revised edn of A Short History of Chinese Art, 1967); Loehr, 33 Yan Liben is documented as producing other works for the tomb, a portrait series that is now lost, and perhaps designed the whole structure.Loehr, 33  Background  It is not known when Yan Liben was born. His ancestors were originally from Mayi (È¶¨ÈÇë, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi), but had relocated to the Guanzhong region (i.e., the region around Chang'an) several generations prior to Yan Liben. Yan Liben's father Yan Pi () was the deputy director of palace affairs during Sui Dynasty, and both Yan Liben and his older brother Yan Lide () were known for their abilities in architectural matters and service to the imperial government in that area. Both were also painters and successful administrators at court, and trained Yan Liben in succession; his father died suddenly at 49. He grew up in Chang'an, and initially collaborated with his elder brother on two works whose titles are recorded.Loehr, 32  During Emperor Taizong's reign  Emperor Taizong Receiving the Tibetan Envoy, probably a later copy Yan Liben was skilled in public work projects, but became particularly known for his artistic skills. It was for this reason that Emperor Taizong, the second emperor of Tang Dynasty, commissioned Yan to paint portraits to commemorate the 24 great contributors to his reign at Lingyan Pavilion and the 18 great scholars who served under him when he was the Prince of Qin. His Emperor Taizong Receiving the Tibetan Envoy probably dates to this period. Although the Chinese aristocracy counted painting as one of their accepted pastimes, the profession of the painter was not a highly venerated vocation. On one occasion, when Emperor Taizong was rowing a boat with his attendant scholars at the imperial pond, there were birds flying by. Emperor Taizong had the scholars write poems to praise the scene and then summoned Yan to paint a portrait of the scene. Yan was at the time already a mid-level official in the administration, but when he summoned Yan, the imperial attendants called out, \\"Summon the imperial painter, Yan Liben!\\" When Yan heard the order, he became ashamed for being known only as the painter, and he commented to his son, \\"I had studied well when I was young, and it was fortunate of me to have avoided being turned away from official service and to be known for my abilities. However, now I am only known for my painting skills, and I end up serving like a servant. This is shameful. Do not learn this skill.\\" However, as he still favored painting, he continued to do so even after this incident.  During Emperor Gaozong's reign  During the Xianqing era (656‚Äì661) of the reign of Emperor Taizong's son Emperor Gaozong, Yan Liben served as the imperial architect. He later succeeded his brother Yan Lide as the minister of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Gongbu Shangshu). Around the new year 669, he became acting You Xiang (): the head of the examination bureau of government (Ë•øËá∫, Xi Tai) and a post considered one for a chancellor, and Emperor Gaozong created him the Baron of Boling. As Yan's fellow chancellor Jiang Ke (the acting head of the legislative bureau (Â∑¶Áõ∏, Zuo Xiang)) was promoted to the chancellor post at the same time due to his battlefield achievements, a semi-derogatory couplet was written around the time stating, \\"The Zuo Xiang established his power over the desert, and the You Xiang established his fame over a canvass.\\" In 670, Yan became officially the head of the legislative bureau, now with the title changed to Zhongshu Ling (). He died in 673.

It is created by using the Platostoma palustre plant (a member of the mint family) and has a mild, slightly bitter taste. It is served chilled, with other toppings such as fruit, or in bubble tea or other drinks. Outside Asia, it is sold in Asian supermarkets. Nutritional Value Containing carbohydrates 44 g. per 330 g. of grass jelly and 2 g. of these carbohydrates are from dietary fiber, and also contains 2 g. of protein. Moreover, grass jelly does not have any fat, vitamins or minerals. Preparation Grass jelly is made by boiling the aged and slightly oxidized stalks and leaves of Platostoma palustre (Mesona chinensis) with potassium carbonate for several hours with a little starch and then cooling the liquid to a jelly-like consistency. This jelly can be cut into cubes or other forms, and then mixed with syrup to produce a drink or dessert thought to have cooling (yin) properties, which makes it typically consumed during hot weather. The jelly itself is fragrant, with a smoky undertone, and is a translucent dark brown, sometimes perceived to be black. Food coloring may sometimes be added to make it darker. Some other variants of grass jelly, known as green grass jelly, don't require cooking or heating process to make, only requiring a mixture of leaf extracts and water. Jelly produced in this way has been described as having a leafy neutral or plain flavor. Regional =Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau= In Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau, grass jelly was traditionally served with sugar syrup. Now it is often served mixed with other ingredients, such as mango, sago, watermelon, cantaloupe, and other fresh or canned fruit, and condensed or evaporated milk. Although this dish is sometimes called liangfen (leung fan) in Chinese, it should not be confused with the Chinese starch jelly liangfen, which is an entirely different dish. =Indonesia= Green grass jelly Chaokuai sold on the Sunday Walking Street market in Chiang Mai, Thailand Grass jelly is known as cincau in Indonesian (it means green grass in Chinese). It is also known as camcao, juju, janggelan or kepleng in Java, camcauh in Sunda, and daluman in Bali. Black jelly (cincau hitam) is manufactured as an instant powder, like other instant jellies or agar. This form is easier to use. It is made from the leaves of Platostoma palustre (Mesona palustris). There are other plants that were used in Indonesia to make grass jelly. They are Melastoma polyanthum, known as cincau perdu, and Cyclea barbata, known as cincau hijau or green grass jelly, and Cocculus orbiculatus or known as cincau Cina or Chinese green grass jelly. Some plants from genus Stephania such as Stephania hernandifolia (also known as Stephania japonica) and Stephania capitata are also being used as a substitute to create green grass jelly called cincau minyak or oily grass jelly. Usually, the process of making Indonesian green grass jelly doesn't require a cooking or heating process. Mixing leaf extract and water with the addition of a period of waiting time for coagulation at mild room temperature is enough. Indonesian green grass jelly has a distinct flavor compared to black grass jelly. It is absent of smoky flavor, almost no bitter taste, and has a mild leafy flavor. Due to its plain neutral flavor, it is usually consumed with sugar water, syrup, coconut milk, and ice. =Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei= Plain grass jelly is mixed in various kinds of desserts, such as ais kacang and cendol. It is also mixed with cold soy milk and served as a refreshing drink/dessert, a drink known as Michael Jackson in South-East Asia (a reference to Michael Jackson's changing skin color and/or the song \\"Black or White\\"). Various combinations of grass jelly with rose flavoured syrup added to milk (bandung) are called \\"bandung cincau\\" or \\"bancau\\" for short. There is also shaved ice with grass jelly toppings. It can be green or brown. =Philippines= Grass jelly (Philippine: gulaman) bricks are used in the various Philippine refreshments or desserts such as sago‚Äôt gulaman, buko-pandan, agar flan or halo-halo. It may also be used in fruit salads. =Taiwan= In Taiwan, grass jelly is known as ‰ªôËçâ (xian cao), and is used in various desserts and drinks. It can sometimes be added to boba drinks and shaved ice (Âà®ÂÜ∞). It is also commonly used in a traditional Taiwanese drink, where the jelly is heated and melted to be consumed as a thick dessert beverage (‰ªôËçâËå∂), with numerous toppings like tangyuan, taro balls, azuki beans, and tapioca. =Thailand= In Thailand, grass jelly is known as chaokuai (, ) like the Teochew (from Hokkien ). It is commonly served relatively plain together with ice and natural brown sugar. Additionally, it can also be served with fruits such as jackfruit, the fruit of the toddy palm or mixed with other Thai desserts. =Vietnam= In Vietnamese, grass jelly is s∆∞∆°ng s√°o or th·∫°ch s∆∞∆°ng s√°o. Grass jelly is chopped in small cubes and served as an additional ingredient in sweet desserts made from various kinds of beans (ch√®). There are two common kinds of grass jelly in Vietnam which are Platostoma palustre (Mesona chinensis, called s∆∞∆°ng s√°o in Vietnamese) and Tiliacora triandra (called s∆∞∆°ng s√¢m; s∆∞∆°ng sa or rau c√¢u is the name for jelly made from various kinds of algae). It is common now to eat green grass jelly (th·∫°ch l√° gƒÉng) with douhua (t√†o ph·ªõ) and grass jelly (s∆∞∆°ng s√°o or th·∫°ch ƒëen) in the summer.

The town of Huiz√∫car is the head of the Huiz√∫car district in the city of La Libertad. This town is 23 kilometers (14 miles) away from San Salvador and has an elevation of 640 meters (2,100 feet) above sea level. The patron saint of the town is Saint Michael the Archangel. Church of Huiz√∫car The Catholic Church in Huizucar The Church of Huiz√∫car is a colonial style church that was built in 1740. Although the builder remains unknown, many believe that the plan of the church was designed by Friar Mart√≠n de Jes√∫s. The Church features notable architectural characteristics including the Mudejar style present in the beams and ceilings. It is built entirely from wood, with a skeleton of even roofs and large beams resting on thick wooden pillars with bases of molded brick. The facade is composed of a single body, and presents a triangular forehead on the roof that is covered with molded figures. The facade features a niche with the image of Saint Michael the Archangel, made of masonry and embedded in the wall. Its interior is of three simple naves separated by 18 columns. The walls are approximately 1.4 meters thick, and are made of adobes, which are bricks made from clay. The presbytery rectangular and its cover is a dome of coffered Mudejar type. An arch with vegetation design separates the presbytery from the ship. The altarpieces are carved in wood, and they conserve vestiges of bread of gold of their Baroque style. It has images, pictorial works, and altars in Baroque style. The last time the church was remodeled was in 1974. When the restoration began, the building was in a state of advanced deterioration. It was noticed that its structures and covers had been heavily damaged by humidity, termites, and other causes. The wooden structures, particularly of the roof, were semi-destroyed. The walls contained long and deep cracks, which had widened as a result of water leakage and tremors. The main facade was obstructed completely by a recently constructed piazza and a tower. The tower, placed on the left corner buttress, was partially destroyed because it had been lifted to serve as a steeple. The primary purpose of the restoration was to liberate the original construction from the piazza and the steeple, which lacked historical value. Most components of the ceiling, like props, feathers, beams, and others were replaced, and the coffers of Mudejar style were armed again. The walls were repaired, stuffing the cracks and holes, as well as the buttresses, three of which were reconstructed totally. All the walls were sealed and whitened with lime. The foundation of the village came long before the colony. Its autochthonous name means: \\"Place on the way of the thorns.\\" In the report of Monsignor Pedro Cortez and Larraz of the year 1770, Huiz√∫car was a small town annex to the rectory of San Jacinto, where 200 families lived. There is also data of San Salvador Mayor, Don Manuel de G√°lvez Corral that says that in 1740, it had 220 tributary-Indians or heads of household (that is to say, about 1100 inhabitants). The Patron Festivity takes place on September 29 in honor of San Miguel Archangel.

According to the 2007 census, Jayaque has a population of 11,058. It covers an area of approximately and has an altitude of at its highest elevation. The Nahuatl place-name Jayaque, Shaycat or Xayacatepeque, translates to \\"Hill of the masked\\" or \\"Hill of the masks or of the enamored ones.\\" History According to 21st century municipal records, the settlers of this site occupied the territory of Opico, but left the site due to \\"several plagues\\" at the beginning of the 18th century. In 1770, according to Pedro Cort√©s y Larraz, the village was home to 578 people. It has been a part of the Department of La Libertad since 28 January 1865, and was officially designated a city 18 May 1926. In the 1960s and 70s Jayaque was a vibrant town that served as the financial and educational center for all the other towns in the region. With the advent of political problems in the 1980s, the town lost its preeminence and became a more passive participant in the area's social, political and economic activities. It was not as significantly impacted by the Salvadoran Civil War of 1979-1992 as other communities in El Salvador and as a result, many people from more war-torn areas migrated to Jayaque and the surrounding areas. This wave of migrants brought with it violence and instability; gang violence continues to affect the area into the 21st century. General Information Jayaque has traditionally based its economy on coffee production. The town is surrounded by coffee plantations, and there are a number of coffee production facilities in these plantations where fresh coffee is processed and beans are made ready for export. As is true across El Salvador, most of Jayaque's residents are Catholic. Celebrations are held every year in July to honor Jayaque's patron saint, Saint Christopher. Together with their nearby sister community of Cuisnahuat and the residents of Tepecoyo, the people of Jayaque celebrate the Festival of \\"Los Cumpas\\" (a colloquialism designated to represent the companionship between sister cities). Some Protestant churches have also been established, however, with the most significant growth of Protestantism occurring during and after the civil war. The Lutheran Church, very small in El Salvador, has churches in Jayaque and in the nearby community of Dos de Mayo, which is officially a part of Jayaque. These churches are sponsored by the Lutheran Church of Penzberg, Bavaria, Germany as well as through relationships with churches in the Greater Milwaukee Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, in southeast Wisconsin, USA. For many years, the pastors of the churches in Jayaque (Pan de Vida ILS) and Dos de Mayo (Montes de Penzberg ILS) were Francisco and Jesus Carrillo. The Carrillos were murdered 4 November 2006 just outside the church in Dos de Mayo after leading worship service there, and are considered by many to be martyrs. Investigation into the murders was discontinued in 2008 due to concerns the investigation itself might be contributing to additional violence. Gang violence and politically motivated assassination are plausible theories. Pastor Blanca Irma Rodriguez was called to replace the Carrillos following their assassination. {  View of city streets in Jayaque, La Libertad, El Salvador  Carrillo memorial across from Montes de Penzberg ILS in Dos de Mayo  Pan de Vida ILS Lutheran Church in Jayaque, La Libertad, El Salvador } Category:Municipalities of the La Libertad Department (El Salvador) ","title":"Jayaque"},{"id":"2381908","text":"Jicalapa is a municipality in the La Libertad department of El Salvador.

History In 1770 this area was referred to by Pedro Cortes, the Archbishop of Guatemala (1776-1779), as the \\"hacienda Tepeahua\\", one of the largest estates in the parish of San Jacinto. The region was known as Tepeahua, a name derived from a Nahuatl expression meaning \\"mountain of the oak trees\\", before the Congress of the Federal Republic of Central America authorized the name \\"Puerto de La Libertad\\" (Port of Freedom) on February 24, 1824. The national assembly chartered commercial trade on the Pacific coast in 1831, and the first steamboat arrived at La Libertad on June 7, 1857. La Libertad was incorporated as a village by an Executive decree of July 19, 1858, which was approved by the Congress on February 11, 1859. This was done to relieve the community's excessive dependence on the town of Huiz√∫car, located at a considerable distance and connected by bad roads. Tropical beach at La Libertad The town became part of the department of La Libertad on January 28, 1865, and by 1869 had a population of 266 inhabitants.

The Salvadoran government enfranchised La Libertad as a villa (town) on March 10, 1874, and as a ciudad (city) on 23 August 1957. The telegraph line between San Salvador and the port was inaugurated on April 27, 1870. The municipality covers an area of 162 km¬≤ and its highest elevation is 10m above sea level.

Among the area's highlights is the Parque Nacional Walter Thilo Deininger (Walter Thilo Deininger National Park), situated on the Coastal Highway (CA-2) near Playa San Diego, going east from La Libertad towards the El Salvador International Airport. The Deiningers were the first German immigrants to settle in the La Libertad department. They established dairies, cattle ranches and coffee plantations. Surfing The surf break at Punta Roca La Libertad has one of the best right hand point breaks in Central America, and is El Salvador's surf capital, with surf shops, board rentals and repair shops. Punta Roca (Rock Point) hosts regional and international surfing championships. It is known for its fast and hollow waves, many of which break for 100-200 yards (90-180m). As recently as the 1970s only a few local surfers ventured there, until it was discovered by a few internationally recognized surfers, including Gerry Lopez, who traveled there frequently. He encouraged a new cadre of locals to adopt the sport. El Salvador went through a civil war in the 1980s, and getting to Punta Roca became dangerous. This slowed the influx of visitors, and resulted in a scarcity of surf boards for the locals, whose only means of obtaining a surf board was by travelers leaving them behind in exchange for guidance and accommodations. The well-known local surfer, \\"Yepi\\", was one of the first in his generation to take a leadership role in popularizing the sport among Salvadorans. Other local surfers have helped spread surfing's popularity throughout the country by offering custom surf tours to tourists and other visitors. The main break extends from La Punta to the township, a distance of about 800m, although single rides do not normally connect the sections through the whole distance. There are three main sections: the top of the point is a hollow and fast wave called \\"La Punta\\". The middle section is in front of the cemetery. The inside cove, fronting the town's restaurants, is called \\"La Paz\\"; this section is good for longboarding. On a good day, when the swell is 6 to 8 feet high (Hawaiian scale), the upper part of the point produces the best waves, allowing a ride of about 300m or more. It is relatively easy to \\"drop in\\" on the long, fast, and powerful walls, which turn into hollow barrels on the best days. The main takeoff is close to a dangerous rock which often sticks out of the water, and has caused injuries. Surfing is good on all tides, although low tide probably produces more barreled waves. The wave form of this break is unusual in that it often breaks at a slight angle to the shoreline, hitting it slightly squarely, creating powerful and fast walls. It can be difficult to get outside in large swells, and the rocky shoreline is notorious for its difficult entry. Further down the point are a few other breaks, including next to the cemetery and in the town itself. These are less crowded and can produce waist-high waves on occasions, but the world-class section of the point is far outside of town. Other surf spots in the region include: Conchalio, La Paz, San Diego, EL Zunzal, La Bocana, and El Zonte. The Pier Puerto de La Libertad Pier El Puerto de La Libertad was the first port built in El Salvador. It has evolved into a fishing boat port, a farmers market, and a tourist attraction. Two newer ports in the country have replaced it economically, La Union and Puerto de Acajutla. The original pier was built in 1869, but over time the structure deteriorated and was replaced by a modern structure, which underwent a major renovation in 2003. Fishing boats are lowered into the ocean by a crane located at its end. Local fishermen sell their catch of the day here; seafood on display includes a variety of fish such as snapper, tuna, and rays, as well as squid, shrimp, lobster, blue crabs (popularly known as \\"jaibas\\"), clams, and scallops. During the 2001 series of earthquakes the pier was partially damaged; the damaged section was reconstructed and reinforced. Transportation CA-2 Acajutla Several freeways connect the city of La Libertad with the rest of the country, among these are: *CA-4 or Carretera al Puerto - Connects to San Salvador *CA-2 or El Litoral - Connects to Sonsonate, Zacatecoluca, Ahuachap√°n, and to the international airport.

History 96.1 signed on in 1993 as Christian AC KBIQ, and was originally owned by The Word in Music Inc. which is now known today as Bethesda Christian Broadcasting. TWIM was a non-profit corporation which did on-air fundraisers for the station but sold commercial air time. In 1996, Salem Communications brought KBIQ and continued the Christian AC format. During the same year, Salem brought crosstown KIKX 102.7 FM and moved the Christian AC format and call letters to that respected frequency. Salem then adopted the call letters KPRZ for 96.1 and flipped it to a Praise & Worship format and adopting the moniker \\"Praise 96.\\" In 1999, Salem entered an agreement with AMFM Inc. (which would be absorbed into Clear Channel) to swap stations. As part of the deal, Salem would acquire KSKY in Dallas-Fort Worth while AMFM would acquire KPRZ-FM. After the station swap, KPRZ-FM flipped to a classic rock format as KMOM (Mother 96.1). KMOM started as a classic rock format adopting the moniker \\"Classic Rock That Really Rocks,\\" competing with cross-town competitors KKFM and KYZX. They also added the syndicated Bob & Tom Show to the morning lineup. Clear Channel later altered the format of KMOM to combine classic rock with more newer rock titles to compete with competitor KILO, adopting the moniker \\"Rock That Really Rocks\\", and added Tom Leykis afternoons for a short time in 2004. The station never really took off ratings or revenue wise, and Clear Channel remained committed to the format until October 2004 when it flipped to its current Rhythmic format as KIBT.

Its campus is located in the center of Eastside commercial area of Portland, Oregon, United States. Students are given a special emphasis in a technical area. The school is a member of SkillsUSA and Health Occupations Students of America.  History of Benson  = Benson's predecessor = Benson Polytechnic High School began in 1908 as the Portland School of Trades in the Atkinson Building at 11th and Davis in Northwest Portland. It was established to give \\"boys who wished to enter a trade a better opportunity than do shops and factories of the present time.\\" Any boy from Portland who was at least fourteen years old, or who was a grammar school graduate, could attend. The course of study was three years. Students could also attend night school and/or summer sessions at the trade school. In 1909, a course of study for girls was added, with classes in sewing, cooking, millinery, and homemaking. The Portland School of Trades was coeducational until 1913, when the girls' departments were moved to the original Lincoln High School. = Beginnings and World War I = The Portland School Board voted to change the school's name to Benson Polytechnic High School after civic leader and philanthropist Simon Benson gave $100,000 in 1915, with a stipulation that at least the same amount of money be spent by the Portland School District to start the school. Six blocks of land at Northeast 12th and Hoyt were purchased and a building was built, and the new Benson Polytechnic School opened its doors on September 4, 1917. The building was designed by Floyd Naramore. Portable classrooms were required early on and were still used into the 1950s. Mr. Benson gave the student body $10,000 during World War I, and the first Tech Show was presented to the Portland community. Benson Polytechnic School grew rapidly in course offerings and in student population. In 1920, the printing department was set up and the school paper, the Tech Pep, was published. In 1926, an aviation department was added to the school. Benson Polytechnic School served not only the educational needs of the city's youth, but also the defense needs of a nation at war. Shortly after World War I, beginning in 1919, the federal government contracted with the school, and 50 disabled soldiers were educated. = KBPS radio = In May 1921 the Benson Tech Radio Club received a government license to operate telegraph station 7YK, later changing the call sign to 7XAD in October 1923. This would lead to Benson's first broadcasting station on May 4, 1923 at 6:00 PM when station KFIF signed on the air. This was only the second radio station operated by an educational institute. KFIF would become KBPS on March 17, 1930 when KFIF became too expensive for the student body to operate, the District accepted ownership of the station. The station was renamed KBPS (for Benson Polytechnic School) and has continued to this day to operate on the Benson campus and to be staffed by Benson students. = Expansion and World War II = By 1940, Benson had 2,800 students and was the largest school in Portland. Due to the baby boom and passing of a $25 million building levy by the school district in 1947, 29 portable buildings dating from World War I were scheduled for replacement. = Modern times = Main entrance to Benson Polytechnic High School. The inscription says Erected Anno Domini MCMXVI, meaning 1916 AD. In 1953, the Portland School Board launched a five-year building program to upgrade Benson. A library and automotive wing were completed in 1954. The north shop wing was remodeled in 1955 and the south shop wing in 1960. Benson became co-educational once again in September 1973. Six females attended that year. When the health occupations program was moved from Washington High School to Benson in 1980, Benson's female population grew substantially. An arson fire damaged offices and classrooms in the main section of Benson on January 2, 1991. Coincidentally, the School Board had already scheduled the Benson facility for major improvements. In 1991, a new health occupation wing, a new library, a new student services center, and a new band room were added, and halls and offices were modernized. Benson is slated to be modernized as part of a $790 million bond measured passed in 2017.  Academics  In 2008, 88% of the school's seniors received a high school diploma. Of 271 students, 239 graduated, 27 dropped out, and five stayed for a fifth year. Oregon moved to the Cohort Systemhttp://www.pps.k12.or.us/files/high-school- system/MajorFindings100208.pdf the next year to identify graduates, which yields a lower rate than years previous. 76% of students graduated from Benson in 2009, which was higher than the district average of 66%. Benson is the only school in the Portland Public School district to graduate more minorities than white students.http://files.e2ma.net/16514/assets/docs/0506_grad_cohort_summary.pdf = Student profile = As a magnet school, Benson was highly selective in the Portland area until fairly recently. Students were once required to complete an application for admissions, but this is no longer the case due to the requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act; instead a lottery is used to determine which students are admitted. As of the fall of 2008, there were 1134 students enrolled in Benson, and 61.7% qualified for free or reduced lunch.http://www.pps.k12.or.us/schools-c/profiles/enrollment/enroll_out.php?rpt=382 In the 2017‚Äì2018 school year, Benson's student population was 38.7% White, 25.5% Hispanic, 15.1% African American, 9.6% Asian, 0.6% Native American, 0.6% Pacific Islander, and 9.8% mixed race.  Curriculum  In addition to a standard high school curriculum, students specialize in a self-selected major during the final two years of enrollment. Students may specialize in the following areas, provided by a partnership with SkillsUSA and Health Occupations Students of America (HOSA): ;Arts & Communications Academy *Communications Technology *KBPS Radio Broadcasting ;Health Occupations Academy *Dental Assisting *Medical Assisting *Nursing Assisting *Emergency Medicine ;Industry & Engineering Academy *Automotive Technology *Building Construction Technology *Electrical Technology *Manufacturing Technology = Homebuilding program = Benson is one of three Portland-area high schools (as well as Canby High School, Sherwood High School, and Forest Grove High School) that builds a single-family home in the community.

The album was first issued on Island Records (ILPS 9126) in the UK and in the US as Cotillion Records (SD 9042), a division of Atlantic Records. The album was recorded at Island Studios between May and July 1970. Although McDonald and Giles remains popular among King Crimson fans, its commercial success was limited. The duo did not record a second album. Ian McDonald and Michael Giles were members of the original King Crimson line-up, and were featured performers on the band's debut album, In the Court of the Crimson King (1969). Both left the group at the end of its first United States tour in 1969, although Giles appeared on the second King Crimson album, In the Wake of Poseidon (1970), as a session musician. Two other King Crimson members also worked on McDonald and Giles: Peter Giles and Peter Sinfield. The music on McDonald and Giles contains many of the pastoral and musically complex elements of King Crimson, while generally avoiding that band's darker tendencies. The song \\"Flight of the Ibis\\" has a similar melody and rhythm to King Crimson's \\"Cadence and Cascade\\", with different lyrics. The album contains a guest appearance by Steve Winwood, playing organ and piano on \\"Turnham Green\\". Winwood's group Traffic were working on John Barleycorn Must Die at Island Studios at the same time. Michael Giles' drum solo in \\"Tomorrow's People ‚Äì The Children of Today\\" has been sampled by a number of rap and hip-hop artists, most notably the Beastie Boys, on the track \\"Body Movin'\\" from the album Hello Nasty. The first CD edition was released in Japan in the early 1990s. It came in both jewel box and paper sleeve versions. This version was the same as the original vinyl but was mastered from a tape copy several generations removed from the original master. In 2002 the group members authorised a revised version of the CD with improved sound. The revised version can be recognised by the use of green lettering on the cover instead of pink. A phrase near the beginning of \\"Suite in C\\" has slightly different lyrics. Some of the tracks of the 2002 edition have very minor editing. There are a few slightly different segues in the song \\"Birdman\\" and the sections of this song are marked as separate tracks on the CD.

It is also known as Larock heteroannulation. The reaction is extremely versatile and can be used to produce varying types of indoles. Larock indole synthesis was first proposed by Richard C. Larock in 1991 at Iowa State University.Li, J.J. (2011) \\"Larock Indole Synthesis\\" in Name Reactions in Heterocyclic Chemistry II, John Wiley & Sons, , pp. 143‚Äì166. The Larock indole synthesis Overall reaction The reaction usually occurs with an o-iodianiline or its derivatives, 2‚Äì5 equivalents of an alkyne, palladium(II) (PdII), an excess of sodium or potassium carbonate base, PPh3, and 1 equivalent of LiCl or n-Bu4NCl. N-methyl, N-acetyl, and N-tosyl derivatives of ortho-iodoanilines have been shown to be the most successful anilines that can be used to produce good to excellent yields. Reagents and optimal conditions =Chlorides= Either LiCl or n-Bu4N are used depending on the reaction conditions, but LiCl appears to be the more effective base in Larock indole annulation. The stoichiometry of LiCl is also considerably important, as more than 1 equivalent of LiCl will slow the rate of reaction and lower the overall yield. =Bases= Bases other than sodium or potassium carbonate have been used to produce a good overall yield of the annulation reaction. For example, KOAc can be used with 1 equivalent of LiCl. However, the reaction using KOAc must be used at 120 ¬∞C to reach completion of the reaction at a reasonable time. In contrast K2CO3 can be used at 100 ¬∞C. =Alkynes= The Larock indole synthesis is a flexible reaction partly due to the variety of substituted alkynes that can be used in the annulation reaction. In particular, alkynes with substituents including alkyls, aryls, alkenyls, hydroxyls, and silyls have been successfully used. However, bulkier tertiary alkyl or trimethylsilyl groups have been shown to provide a higher yield. The annulation reaction will also proceed more efficiently when 2‚Äì5 equivalents of an alkyne is used. Less than two equivalents appear to create suboptimal conditions for the reaction. =PPh3 as a catalyst= 5% mol of PPh3 was initially used in the reaction as a catalyst. However, later experiments have shown that PPh3 does not significantly improve the overall yield and is not necessary. Reaction mechanism The Larock indole synthesis proceeds via the following intermediate steps: #Pd(OAc)2 is reduced to Pd(0). #A coordination of the chloride occurs to form a chloride-ligated zerovalent palladium. #The o-iodoaniline undergoes oxidative addition to Pd(II). #The alkyne coordinates to the Pd(II) by ligand exchange. #A migratory insertion causes the alkyne to undergo regioselective syn-insertion into arylpalladium bond. Regioselectivity is determined during this step. #The nitrogen displaces the halide in the resulting vinylic palladium intermediate to form the six- membered palladium-containing heteroatom. #The Pd(II) center undergoes a reductive elimination to form the indole and regenerate Pd(0) which can then be recycled into the catalytic indole process. Larock indole synthesis mechanism. The carbopalladation step is regioselective when unsymmetrical alkynes are used. Although it was previously believed that the alkyne is inserted with the less sterically-hindering R-group adjacent to the arylpalladium, Larock et al. observed that the larger more sterically- hindering R-group is inserted next to the arylpalladium. They suggest that the driving force of the alkyne insertion may be the steric hindrance present in the developing carbon-carbon bond and the orientation of the alkyne prior to syn-insertion of the alkyne into the aryl palladium bond. Alkyne insertion occurs so that the large substituent on the alkyne avoids steric strain from the short developing carbon-carbon bond by interacting with the longer carbon- palladium bond. Regioselectivity of the alkyne insertion in Larock indole synthesis Modifications and variations o-bromoanilines or o-chloroanilines do not undergo Larock indole synthesis. However, researchers from Boehringer- Ingelheim were able to successfully use both o-bromoanilines and o-chloroanilines to form indoles by using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as the solvent with 1,1'bis(di-tert-butylphosphino)ferrocene as the palladium ligand.Li, G., Liu, J., Lu, B., Roschangar, F., Senanayake, C.H., Shen, M. (2005) \\"By reacting with substituted acetylenes in the presence of a phosphine ligand and a base (K2CO3); used to make drugs\\" O-bromoanilines and o-chloroanilines are more readily available and cost-effective over using o-iodianiline in Larock indole synthesis. Heterannulation of an indole using o-chloroaniline Monguchi et al. also derived 2- and 2,3-substituted indoles without using LiCl. The optimized Indole reaction uses 10% Pd/C (3.0 mol%) with 1.1 equivalent of NaOAc, and NMP at 110‚Äì130 ¬∞C. Monguchi et al. state that their optimized condition of the Larock indole synthesis without LiCl is a more mild, environmentally benign, and efficient strategy for producing indoles. Applications Indoles are one of the most prevalent heterocyclic structures found in biological processes, so the production of indole derivatives are important in a diversity of fields. Nishikawa et al. derived iso-tryptophan by using Larock indole synthesis with pre-synthesized Œ±-C- glucosylpropargyl glycine and o-iodo-tosylanilide. This reaction produced the product which had the reverse regioselectivity of normal Larock indole synthesis. The larger substituent was placed adjacent to the forming carbon- carbon bond, rather than the carbon-palladium bond. The explanation for the reverse regioselectivity which produced the iso-tryptophan is unknown. Larock indole synthesis of iso-tryptophan using Œ±-C-glycosylamino acid Optically active tryptophan which adheres to the regioselectivity of the Larock indole synthesis can also be synthesized using o-iodoaniline with propargyl substituted bislactim ethyl ether. Propargyl substituted bislactim ethyl ether is generated by using Sch√∂llkopf chiral auxiliary bis lactam ether with n-BuLi, THF, and 3-halo-1-9trimethylsily1)-1-propyne and extracting the trans- isomer of the propargyl-substituted bislactim. Chirally active tryptophan by Larock indole synthesis Other relevant applications include the synthesis of 5-HT1D receptor agonist MK-0462, an anti-migraine drug.

Critical criminology frequently takes a perspective of examining the genesis of crime and nature of 'justice' within the social structure of a class and status inequalities. Law and punishment of crime are viewed as connected to a system of social inequality and as the means of producing and perpetuating this inequality.Online Dictionary of the Social Sciences, Critical Criminology. Athabasca University and ICAAP. Retrieved on: 2011-10-30. Critical criminology also seeks to delve into the foundations of criminological research to unearth any biases. Critical criminology sees crime as a product of oppression of workers ‚Äì in particular, those in greatest poverty ‚Äì and less-advantaged groups within society, such as women and ethnic minorities, are seen to be the most likely to suffer oppressive social relations based upon class division, sexism and racism.Hopkins Burke, R. (2001) An Introduction to Criminological Theory, Cullompton: Willan pg.173 More simply, critical criminology may be defined as any criminological topic area that takes into account the contextual factors of crime or critiques topics covered in mainstream criminology. Convict Criminology Convict Criminology which is one type of critical criminology, emerged in the United States during the late 1990s (Ross and Richards, 2003). It offers an alternative epistemology on crime, criminality and punishment. Scholarship is conducted by PhD-trained former prisoners, prison workers and others who share a belief that in order to be a fully rounded discipline, mainstream criminology needs to be informed by input from those with personal experience of life in correctional institutions. Contributions from academics who are aware of the day-to-day realities of incarceration, the hidden politics that infuse prison administration, and the details and the nuances of prison language and culture, have the potential significantly to enrich scholarly understanding of the corrections system. In addition, Convict Criminologists have been active in various aspects of correctional reform advocacy, particularly where prisoner education is concerned. Socially contingent definitions of crime  It can also rest upon the fundamental assertion that definitions of what constitute crimes are socially and historically contingent, that is, what constitutes a crime varies in different social situations and different periods of history. For example, homosexuality was illegal in the United Kingdom up to 1967 when it was legalized for men over 21. If the act itself remained the same, how could its 'criminal qualities' change such that it became legal? What this question points out to us is that acts do not, in themselves, possess 'criminal qualities', that is, there is nothing inherent that makes any act a crime other than that it has been designated a crime in the law that has jurisdiction in that time and place. Whilst there are many variations on the critical theme in criminology, the term critical criminology has become a cynosure for perspectives that take to be fundamental the understanding that certain acts are crimes because certain people have the power to make them so. The reliance on what has been seen as the oppositional paradigm, administrational criminology, which tends to focus on the criminological categories that governments wish to highlight (mugging and other street crime, violence, burglary, and, as many critical criminologists would contend, predominantly the crimes of the poor) can be questioned. The gap between what these two paradigms suggest is of legitimate criminological interest, is shown admirably by Stephen Box in his book Power, crime, and Mystification where he asserts that one is seven times more likely (or was in 1983) to be killed as a result of negligence by one's employer, than one was to be murdered in the conventional sense (when all demographic weighting had been taken into account). Yet, to this day, no one has ever been prosecuted for corporate manslaughter in the UK. The effect of this, critical criminologists tend to claim, is that conventional criminologies fail to 'lay bare the structural inequalities which underpin the processes through which laws are created and enforced' (Taylor Walton and Young 1973) and that 'deviancy and criminality' are 'shaped by society's larger structure of power and institutions' (ibid). Further failing to note that power represents the capacity 'to enforce one's moral claims' permitting the powerful to 'conventionalize their moral defaults' legitimizing the processes of 'normalized repression' (Gouldner 1971). Thus, fundamentally, critical criminologists are critical of state definitions of crime, choosing instead to focus upon notions of social harm or human rights. Conflict theories According to criminologists, working in the conflict tradition, crime is the result of conflict within societies that is brought about through the inevitable processes of capitalism. Dispute exists between those who espouse a 'pluralist' view of society and those who do not. Pluralists, following from writers like Mills (1956, 1969 for example) are of the belief that power is exercised in societies by groups of interested individuals (businesses, faith groups, government organizations for example)‚Äì vying for influence and power to further their own interests. These criminologists like Vold (Vold and Bernard 1979 [1958]) have been called 'conservative conflict theorists' (Williams and McShane 1988). They hold that crime may emerge from economic differences, differences of culture, or from struggles concerning status, ideology, morality, religion, race or ethnicity. These writers are of the belief that such groups, by claiming allegiance to mainstream culture, gain control of key resources permitting them to criminalize those who do not conform to their moral codes and cultural values. (Selin 1938; Vold 1979 [1958]; Quinney 1970 inter alia). These theorists, therefore, see crime as having roots in symbolic or instrumental conflict occurring at multiple sites within a fragmented society. Others are of the belief that such 'interests', particularly symbolic dimensions such as status are epiphenomenological by- products of more fundamental economic conflict (Taylor, Walton & Young 1973; Quinney 1974, for example). For these theorists, societal conflict from which crime emerges is founded on the fundamental economic inequalities that are inherent in the processes of capitalism (see, for example, Wikipedia article on Rusche and Kirchheimer's Punishment and Social Structure, a book that provides a seminal exposition of Marxian analysis applied to the problem of crime and punishment). Drawing on the work of Marx (1990 [1868]); Engels, (1984 [1845]); and Bonger (1969 [1916]) among others, such critical theorists suggest that the conditions in which crime emerges are caused by the appropriation of the benefits others' labor through the generation of what is known as surplus value, concentrating in the hands of the few owners of the means of production, disproportionate wealth and power. There are two main strands of critical criminological theory following from Marx, divided by differing conceptions of the role of the state in maintenance of capitalist inequalities. On the one hand instrumental Marxists hold that the state is manipulated by the ruling classes to act in their interests. On the other, structuralist Marxists believe that the state plays a more dominant, semi- autonomous role in subjugating those in the (relatively) powerless classes (Sheley 1985; Lynch & Groves 1986). Instrumental Marxists such as Quinney (1975), Chambliss (1975), or Krisberg (1975) are of the belief that capitalist societies are monolithic edifices of inequality, utterly dominated by powerful economic interests. Power and wealth are divided inequitably between the owners of the means of production and those who have only their labor to sell. The wealthy use the state's coercive powers to criminalize those who threaten to undermine that economic order and their position in it. Structural Marxist theory (Spitzer 1975; Greenberg 1993 [1981]; Chambliss & Seidman 1982) on the other hand holds that capitalist societies exhibit a dual power structure in which the state is more autonomous. Through its mediating effect it ameliorates the worst aspects of capitalist inequalities, however, it works to preserve the overall capitalist system of wealth appropriation, criminalizing those who threaten the operation of the system as a whole. As such this means that the state can criminalize not only those powerless who protest the system's injustices but also those excessive capitalists whose conduct threatens to expose the veneer of the legitimacy of capitalist endeavor. Whereas Marxists have conventionally believed in the replacement of capitalism with socialism in a process that will eventually lead to communism, anarchists are of the view that any hierarchical system is inevitably flawed. Such theorists (Pepinsky 1978; Tift & Sulivan 1980; Ferrell 1994 inter alia) espouse an agenda of defiance of existing hierarchies, encouraging the establishment of systems of decentralised, negotiated community justice in which all members of the local community participate. Recent anarchist theorists like Ferrell attempt to locate crime as resistance both to its social construction through symbolic systems of normative censure and to its more structural constructions as threat to the state and to capitalist production. In a move diametrically opposed to that of anarchist theorists, Left Realists wish to distance themselves from any conception of the criminal as heroic social warrior. Instead they are keen to privilege the experience of the victim and the real effects of criminal behaviour. In texts such as Young 1979 & 1986, Young and Matthews 1991, Lea and Young 1984 or Lowman & MacLean 1992, the victim, the state, the public, and the offender are all considered as a nexus of parameters within which talk about the nature of specific criminal acts may be located. Whilst left realists tend to accept that crime is a socially and historically contingent category that is defined by those with the power to do so, they are at pains to emphasise the real harms that crime does to victims who are frequently no less disadvantaged than the offenders. All of the above conflict perspectives see individuals as being inequitably constrained by powerful and largely immutable structures, although they to varying degrees accord to humans a degree of agency. Ultimately, however, the relatively powerless are seen as being repressed by societal structures of governance or economics. Even left realists who have been criticised for being 'conservative' (not least by Cohen 1990), see the victim and the offender as being subject to systems of injustice and deprivation from which victimising behaviour emerges. It is important to keep in mind that conflict theory while derived from Marxism, is distinct from it. Marxism is an ideology, accordingly it is not empirically tested. Conversely, conflict theory is empirically falsifiable and thus, distinct from Marxism (Cao, 2003). Criticism Conflict Criminologies have come under sustained attack from several quarters, not least from those ‚Äì left realists ‚Äì who claim to be within the ranks. Early criminologies, pejoratively referred to as 'left idealist' by Jock Young 1979, were never really popular in the United States, where critical criminology departments at some universities were closed for political reasons (Rock 1997). These early criminologies were called into question by the introduction of mass self-report victim surveys (Hough & Mayhew 1983) that showed that victimisation was intra-class rather than inter- class. Thus notions that crimes like robbery were somehow primitive forms of wealth redistribution were shown to be false. Further attacks emanated from feminists who maintained that the victimisation of women was no mean business and that left idealists' concentration on the crimes of the working classes that could be seen as politically motivated ignored crimes such as rape, domestic violence, or child abuse (Smart 1977). Furthermore, it was claimed, left idealists neglected the comparative aspect of the study of crime, in that they ignored the significant quantities of crime in socialist societies, and ignored the low crime levels in capitalist societies like Switzerland and Japan (Incardi 1980). Feminist theories Feminism in criminology is more than the mere insertion of women into masculine perspectives of crime and criminal justice, for this would suggest that conventional criminology was positively gendered in favour of the masculine. Feminists contend that previous perspectives are un-gendered and as such ignore the gendered experiences of women. Feminist theorists are engaged in a project to bring a gendered dimension to criminological theory. They are also engaged in a project to bring to criminological theory insights to be gained from an understanding of taking a particular standpoint, that is, the use of knowledge gained through methods designed to reveal the experience of the real lives of women. The primary claim of feminists is that social science in general and criminology in particular represents a male perspective upon the world in that it focuses largely upon the crimes of men against men. Moreover, arguably the most significant criminological fact of all, namely that women commit significantly less crime than men, is hardly engaged with either descriptively or explanatory in the literature. In other words, it is assumed that explanatory models developed to explain male crime are taken to be generalizable to women in the face of the extraordinary evidence to the contrary. The conclusion that must be drawn is that not only can those theories not be generalized to women, but that that failure might suggest they may not explain adequately male crime either (Edwards 1989, Messerschmidt 1993, Caulfield and Wonders 1994) A second aspect of feminist critique centers upon the notion that even where women have become criminologists, they have adopted 'malestream' modes of research and understanding, that is they have joined and been assimilated into the modes of working of the masculine paradigm, rendering it simultaneously gender blind and biased (Menzies & Chunn 1991). However, as Menzies and Chunn argue, it is not adequate merely to 'insert' women into 'malestream' criminology, it is necessary to develop a criminology from the standpoint of women. At first glance this may appear to be gender biased against the needs and views of men. However, this claim is based on a position developed by Nancy Hartsock known as standpoint feminism.Stanford Based on the work of Marx, Hartsock suggests that the view of the world from womanhood is a 'truer' vision than that from the viewpoint of man. According to Marx (Marx 1964, Lucacs 1971) privilege blinds people to the realities of the world meaning that the powerless have a clearer view of the world ‚Äì the poor see the wealth of the rich and their own poverty, whilst the rich are inured, shielded from, or in denial about the sufferings of the poor. Hartsock (1983 & 1999) argues that women are in precisely the same position as Marx's poor. From their position of powerlessness they are more capable of revealing the truth about the world than any 'malestream' paradigm ever can. Thus there are two key strands in feminist criminological thought; that criminology can be made gender aware and thus gender neutral; or that that criminology must be gender positive and adopt standpoint feminism. Cutting across these two distinctions, feminists can be placed largely into four main groupings: liberal, radical, Marxist, and socialist (Jaggar 1983). Liberal feminists are concerned with discrimination on the grounds of gender and its prevalence in society and seek to end such discrimination. Such ends are sought through engagement with existing structures such as governments and legal frameworks, rather than by challenging modes of gender construction or hegemonic patriarchy (Hoffman Bustamante 1973, Adler 1975, Simon 1975, Edwards 1990). Thus liberal feminists are more or less content to work within the system to change it from within using its existing structures. Critical feminists ‚Äì radical feminists, Marxists, and socialists ‚Äì are keen to stress the need to dispense with masculine systems and structures. Radical feminists see the roots of female oppression in patriarchy, perceiving its perpetrators as primarily aggressive in both private and public spheres, violently dominating women by control of their sexuality through pornography, rape (Brownmiller 1975), and other forms of sexual violence, thus imposing upon them masculine definitions of womanhood and women's roles, particularly in the family. Marxist feminists, (Rafter & Natalizia 1981, MacKinnon 1982 & 1983) however, hold that such patriarchal structures are emergent from the class producing inequalities inherent in capitalist means of production. The production of surplus value requires that the man who works in the capitalist's factory, pit, or office, requires a secondary, unpaid worker ‚Äì the woman ‚Äì to keep him fit for his labours, by providing the benefits of a home ‚Äì food, keeping house, raising his children, and other comforts of family. Thus, merely in order to be fit to sell his labour, the proletarian man needs to 'keep' a support worker with the already meagre proceeds of his labour. Hence women are left with virtually no economic resources and are thus seen to exist within an economic trap that is an inevitable outcome of capitalist production. Socialist feminists attempt to steer a path between the radical and the Marxist views, identifying capitalist patriarchy as the source of women's oppression (Danner 1991). Such theorists (Eisenstein 1979, Hartmann 1979 & 1981, Messerschmidt 1986, Currie 1989) accept that a patriarchal society constrains women's roles and their view of themselves but that this patriarchy is the result not of male aggression but of the mode of capitalist production. Thus neither capitalist production nor patriarchy is privileged in the production of women's oppression, powerlessness, and economic marginalization. Socialist feminists believe that gender based oppression can only be overcome by creating a non-patriarchal, non-capitalist society, and that attempting merely to modify the status quo from within perpetuates the very system that generates inequalities. Of significant importance in understanding the positions of most of the feminists above is that gender is taken to be a social construct. That is, the differences between men and women are not by and large biological (essentialism) but are insociated from an early age and are defined by existing patriarchal categories of womanhood. In the face of this pacifying or passive image of women, feminist criminologists wish to generate a discursive and real (extended) space within which expressions of women's own views of their identity and womanhood may emerge. There are many forms of criticism leveled at feminist criminology, some 'facile' (Gelsthorpe 1997) such as those of Bottomley & Pease (1986), or Walker (1987) who suggest that feminist thinking is irrelevant to criminology. A major strand of criticism is leveled at what it is argued is its ethnocentrism (Rice 1990, Mama 1989, Ahluwalia 1991), that is, that in its silence on the experience of black women it is as biased as male criminology in its ignorance of the experience of women. Criminology, claim these writers, is sexist and racist and that both errors need to be corrected. A significant number of criticisms are leveled at feminist criminology by Pat Carlen in an important paper from 1992 (Carlen 1992). Among Carlen's criticisms is that of an apparent inability of feminist criminology to reconcile theoretical insight with political reality, exhibiting a 'theoreticist, libertarian, separatist and gender-centric tendenc[y]'. She suggests that this libertarianism reflects itself in a belief that crime reduction policies can be achieved without some form of 'social engineering'. Further criticizing feminism's libertarian streak, Carlen suggests that feminists injunction to allow women to speak for themselves reveals a separatist tendency, arguing that what feminists call for is merely good social science and should be extended to let all classes of humans speak for themselves. This separatism, claims Carlen, further manifests itself in a refusal to accept developments in mainstream criminology branding them 'malestream' or in other pejorative terms. Perhaps the most damning criticism of feminism and of certain stripes of radical feminism in particular is that, in some aspects of western societies, it has itself become the dominant interest group with powers to criminalize masculinity (see Nathanson & Young 2001). Postmodern theories In criminology, the postmodernist school applies postmodernism to the study of crime and criminals, and understands \\"criminality\\" as a product of the power to limit the behaviour of those individuals excluded from power, but who try to overcome social inequality and behave in ways which the power structure prohibits. It focuses on the identity of the human subject, multiculturalism, feminism, and human relationships to deal with the concepts of \\"difference\\" and \\"otherness\\" without essentialism or reductionism, but its contributions are not always appreciated (Carrington: 1998). Postmodernists shift attention from Marxist concerns of economic and social oppression to linguistic production, arguing that criminal law is a language to create dominance relationships. For example, the language of courts (the so-called \\"legalese\\") expresses and institutionalises the domination of the individual, whether accused or accuser, criminal or victim, by social institutions. According to postmodernist criminology, the discourse of criminal law is dominant, exclusive and rejecting, less diverse, and culturally not pluralistic, exaggerating narrowly defined rules for the exclusion of others.

It is also a set of concepts. In contrast, physical models are physical objects; for example, a toy model which may be assembled, and may be made to work like the object it represents. Conceptual model may refer to models which are formed after a conceptualization or generalization process. Conceptual models are often abstractions of things in the real world, whether physical or social. Semantic studies are relevant to various stages of concept formation. Semantics is basically about concepts, the meaning that thinking beings give to various elements of their experience.  Overview  = Models of concepts and models that are conceptual = The term conceptual model is normal. It could mean \\"a model of concept\\" or it could mean \\"a model that is conceptual.\\" A distinction can be made between what models are and what models are made of. With the exception of iconic models, such as a scale model of Winchester Cathedral, most models are concepts. But they are, mostly, intended to be models of real world states of affairs. The value of a model is usually directly proportional to how well it corresponds to a past, present, future, actual or potential state of affairs. A model of a concept is quite different because in order to be a good model it need not have this real world correspondence.Gregory, Frank Hutson (January 1992) Cause, Effect, Efficiency & Soft Systems Models Warwick Business School Research Paper No. 42. With revisions and additions it was published in the Journal of the Operational Research Society (1993) 44(4), pp. 149‚Äì68. In artificial intelligence conceptual models and conceptual graphs are used for building expert systems and knowledge-based systems; here the analysts are concerned to represent expert opinion on what is true not their own ideas on what is true. = Type and scope of conceptual models = Conceptual models (models that are conceptual) range in type from the more concrete, such as the mental image of a familiar physical object, to the formal generality and abstractness of mathematical models which do not appear to the mind as an image. Conceptual models also range in terms of the scope of the subject matter that they are taken to represent. A model may, for instance, represent a single thing (e.g. the Statue of Liberty), whole classes of things (e.g. the electron), and even very vast domains of subject matter such as the physical universe. The variety and scope of conceptual models is due to the variety of purposes had by the people using them. Conceptual modeling is the activity of formally describing some aspects of the physical and social world around us for the purposes of understanding and communication.\\" = Fundamental objectives = Comparison model highlighting conceptual model role in system process A conceptual model's primary objective is to convey the fundamental principles and basic functionality of the system which it represents. Also, a conceptual model must be developed in such a way as to provide an easily understood system interpretation for the model's users. A conceptual model, when implemented properly, should satisfy four fundamental objectives. # Enhance an individual's understanding of the representative system # Facilitate efficient conveyance of system details between stakeholders # Provide a point of reference for system designers to extract system specifications # Document the system for future reference and provide a means for collaboration The conceptual model plays an important role in the overall system development life cycle. Figure 1 below, depicts the role of the conceptual model in a typical system development scheme. It is clear that if the conceptual model is not fully developed, the execution of fundamental system properties may not be implemented properly, giving way to future problems or system shortfalls. These failures do occur in the industry and have been linked to; lack of user input, incomplete or unclear requirements, and changing requirements. Those weak links in the system design and development process can be traced to improper execution of the fundamental objectives of conceptual modeling. The importance of conceptual modeling is evident when such systemic failures are mitigated by thorough system development and adherence to proven development objectives/techniques.  Modelling techniques  As systems have become increasingly complex, the role of conceptual modelling has dramatically expanded. With that expanded presence, the effectiveness of conceptual modeling at capturing the fundamentals of a system is being realized. Building on that realization, numerous conceptual modeling techniques have been created. These techniques can be applied across multiple disciplines to increase the user's understanding of the system to be modeled.I. Davies, P. Green, M. Rosemann, M. Indulska, S. Gallo, How do practitioners use conceptual modeling in practice?, Elsevier, Data & Knowledge Engineering 58 (2006) pp.358‚Äì80 A few techniques are briefly described in the following text, however, many more exist or are being developed. Some commonly used conceptual modeling techniques and methods include: workflow modeling, workforce modeling, rapid application development, object-role modeling, and the Unified Modeling Language (UML). = Data flow modeling = Data flow modeling (DFM) is a basic conceptual modeling technique that graphically represents elements of a system. DFM is a fairly simple technique, however, like many conceptual modeling techniques, it is possible to construct higher and lower level representative diagrams. The data flow diagram usually does not convey complex system details such as parallel development considerations or timing information, but rather works to bring the major system functions into context. Data flow modeling is a central technique used in systems development that utilizes the structured systems analysis and design method (SSADM). = Entity relationship modeling = Entity‚Äìrelationship modeling (ERM) is a conceptual modeling technique used primarily for software system representation. Entity-relationship diagrams, which are a product of executing the ERM technique, are normally used to represent database models and information systems. The main components of the diagram are the entities and relationships. The entities can represent independent functions, objects, or events. The relationships are responsible for relating the entities to one another. To form a system process, the relationships are combined with the entities and any attributes needed to further describe the process. Multiple diagramming conventions exist for this technique; IDEF1X, Bachman, and EXPRESS, to name a few. These conventions are just different ways of viewing and organizing the data to represent different system aspects. = Event- driven process chain = The event-driven process chain (EPC) is a conceptual modeling technique which is mainly used to systematically improve business process flows. Like most conceptual modeling techniques, the event driven process chain consists of entities/elements and functions that allow relationships to be developed and processed. More specifically, the EPC is made up of events which define what state a process is in or the rules by which it operates. In order to progress through events, a function/ active event must be executed. Depending on the process flow, the function has the ability to transform event states or link to other event driven process chains. Other elements exist within an EPC, all of which work together to define how and by what rules the system operates. The EPC technique can be applied to business practices such as resource planning, process improvement, and logistics. = Joint application development = The dynamic systems development method uses a specific process called JEFFF to conceptually model a systems life cycle. JEFFF is intended to focus more on the higher level development planning that precedes a project's initialization. The JAD process calls for a series of workshops in which the participants work to identify, define, and generally map a successful project from conception to completion. This method has been found to not work well for large scale applications, however smaller applications usually report some net gain in efficiency. = Place/transition net = Also known as Petri nets, this conceptual modeling technique allows a system to be constructed with elements that can be described by direct mathematical means. The petri net, because of its nondeterministic execution properties and well defined mathematical theory, is a useful technique for modeling concurrent system behavior, i.e. simultaneous process executions. = State transition modeling = State transition modeling makes use of state transition diagrams to describe system behavior. These state transition diagrams use distinct states to define system behavior and changes. Most current modeling tools contain some kind of ability to represent state transition modeling. The use of state transition models can be most easily recognized as logic state diagrams and directed graphs for finite- state machines. = Technique evaluation and selection = Because the conceptual modeling method can sometimes be purposefully vague to account for a broad area of use, the actual application of concept modeling can become difficult. To alleviate this issue, and shed some light on what to consider when selecting an appropriate conceptual modeling technique, the framework proposed by Gemino and Wand will be discussed in the following text. However, before evaluating the effectiveness of a conceptual modeling technique for a particular application, an important concept must be understood; Comparing conceptual models by way of specifically focusing on their graphical or top level representations is shortsighted. Gemino and Wand make a good point when arguing that the emphasis should be placed on a conceptual modeling language when choosing an appropriate technique. In general, a conceptual model is developed using some form of conceptual modeling technique. That technique will utilize a conceptual modeling language that determines the rules for how the model is arrived at. Understanding the capabilities of the specific language used is inherent to properly evaluating a conceptual modeling technique, as the language reflects the techniques descriptive ability. Also, the conceptual modeling language will directly influence the depth at which the system is capable of being represented, whether it be complex or simple.  Considering affecting factors  Building on some of their earlier work, Gemino and Wand acknowledge some main points to consider when studying the affecting factors: the content that the conceptual model must represent, the method in which the model will be presented, the characteristics of the model's users, and the conceptual model languages specific task. The conceptual model's content should be considered in order to select a technique that would allow relevant information to be presented. The presentation method for selection purposes would focus on the technique's ability to represent the model at the intended level of depth and detail. The characteristics of the model's users or participants is an important aspect to consider. A participant's background and experience should coincide with the conceptual model's complexity, else misrepresentation of the system or misunderstanding of key system concepts could lead to problems in that system's realization. The conceptual model language task will further allow an appropriate technique to be chosen. The difference between creating a system conceptual model to convey system functionality and creating a system conceptual model to interpret that functionality could involve two completely different types of conceptual modeling languages.  Considering affected variables  Gemino and Wand go on to expand the affected variable content of their proposed framework by considering the focus of observation and the criterion for comparison. The focus of observation considers whether the conceptual modeling technique will create a \\"new product\\", or whether the technique will only bring about a more intimate understanding of the system being modeled. The criterion for comparison would weigh the ability of the conceptual modeling technique to be efficient or effective. A conceptual modeling technique that allows for development of a system model which takes all system variables into account at a high level may make the process of understanding the system functionality more efficient, but the technique lacks the necessary information to explain the internal processes, rendering the model less effective. When deciding which conceptual technique to use, the recommendations of Gemino and Wand can be applied in order to properly evaluate the scope of the conceptual model in question. Understanding the conceptual models scope will lead to a more informed selection of a technique that properly addresses that particular model. In summary, when deciding between modeling techniques, answering the following questions would allow one to address some important conceptual modeling considerations. # What content will the conceptual model represent? # How will the conceptual model be presented? # Who will be using or participating in the conceptual model? # How will the conceptual model describe the system? # What is the conceptual models focus of observation? # Will the conceptual model be efficient or effective in describing the system? Another function of the simulation conceptual model is to provide a rational and factual basis for assessment of simulation application appropriateness. Models in philosophy and science = Mental model = In cognitive psychology and philosophy of mind, a mental model is a representation of something in the mind,Mental Representation:The Computational Theory of Mind, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, but a mental model may also refer to a nonphysical external model of the mind itself.Mental Models and Usability, Depaul University, Cognitive Psychology 404, Nov, 15, 1999, Mary Jo Davidson, Laura Dove, Julie Weltz, = Metaphysical models = A metaphysical model is a type of conceptual model which is distinguished from other conceptual models by its proposed scope; a metaphysical model intends to represent reality in the broadest possible way. This is to say that it explains the answers to fundamental questions such as whether matter and mind are one or two substances; or whether or not humans have free will. = Conceptual model vs. semantics model = Conceptual Models and semantic models have many similarities, however the way they are presented, the level of flexibility and the use are different. Conceptual models have a certain purpose in mind, hence the core semantic concepts are predefined in a so-called meta model. This enables a pragmatic modelling but reduces the flexibility, as only the predefined semantic concepts can be used. Samples are flow charts for process behaviour or organisational structure for tree behaviour. Semantic models are more flexible and open, and therefore more difficult to model. Potentially any semantic concept can be defined, hence the modelling support is very generic. Samples are terminologies, taxonomies or ontologies. In a concept model each concept has a unique and distinguishable graphical representation, whereas semantic concepts are by default the same. In a concept model each concept has predefined properties that can be populated, whereas semantic concepts are related to concepts that are interpreted as properties. In a concept model operational semantic can be built-in, like the processing of a sequence, whereas a semantic model needs explicit semantic definition of the sequence. The decision if a concept model or a semantic model is used, depends therefore on the \\"object under survey\\", the intended goal, the necessary flexibility as well as how the model is interpreted. In case of human-interpretation there may be a focus on graphical concept models, in case of machine interpretation there may be the focus on semantic models. = Epistemological models = An epistemological model is a type of conceptual model whose proposed scope is the known and the knowable, and the believed and the believable. = Logical models = In logic, a model is a type of interpretation under which a particular statement is true. Logical models can be broadly divided into ones which only attempt to represent concepts, such as mathematical models; and ones which attempt to represent physical objects, and factual relationships, among which are scientific models. Model theory is the study of (classes of) mathematical structures such as groups, fields, graphs, or even universes of set theory, using tools from mathematical logic. A system that gives meaning to the sentences of a formal language is called a model for the language. If a model for a language moreover satisfies a particular sentence or theory (set of sentences), it is called a model of the sentence or theory. Model theory has close ties to algebra and universal algebra. = Mathematical models = Mathematical models can take many forms, including but not limited to dynamical systems, statistical models, differential equations, or game theoretic models. These and other types of models can overlap, with a given model involving a variety of abstract structures. A more comprehensive type of mathematical modelDI Spivak, RE Kent. \\"Ologs: a category-theoretic approach to knowledge representation\\" (2011). PLoS ONE (in press): e24274. uses a linguistic version of category theory to model a given situation. Akin to entity-relationship models, custom categories or sketches can be directly translated into database schemas. The difference is that logic is replaced by category theory, which brings powerful theorems to bear on the subject of modeling, especially useful for translating between disparate models (as functors between categories). = Scientific models = A scientific model is a simplified abstract view of a complex reality. A scientific model represents empirical objects, phenomena, and physical processes in a logical way. Attempts to formalize the principles of the empirical sciences use an interpretation to model reality, in the same way logicians axiomatize the principles of logic. The aim of these attempts is to construct a formal system for which reality is the only interpretation. The world is an interpretation (or model) of these sciences, only insofar as these sciences are true.edited by Hans Freudenthal (1951), The Concept and the Role of the Model in Mathematics and Natural and Social Sciences, pp. 8‚Äì9  Statistical models  A statistical model is a probability distribution function proposed as generating data. In a parametric model, the probability distribution function has variable parameters, such as the mean and variance in a normal distribution, or the coefficients for the various exponents of the independent variable in linear regression. A nonparametric model has a distribution function without parameters, such as in bootstrapping, and is only loosely confined by assumptions. Model selection is a statistical method for selecting a distribution function within a class of them; e.g., in linear regression where the dependent variable is a polynomial of the independent variable with parametric coefficients, model selection is selecting the highest exponent, and may be done with nonparametric means, such as with cross validation. In statistics there can be models of mental events as well as models of physical events. For example, a statistical model of customer behavior is a model that is conceptual (because behavior is physical), but a statistical model of customer satisfaction is a model of a concept (because satisfaction is a mental not a physical event).  Social and political models  = Economic models = In economics, a model is a theoretical construct that represents economic processes by a set of variables and a set of logical and/or quantitative relationships between them. The economic model is a simplified framework designed to illustrate complex processes, often but not always using mathematical techniques. Frequently, economic models use structural parameters. Structural parameters are underlying parameters in a model or class of models. A model may have various parameters and those parameters may change to create various properties.  Models in systems architecture  A system model is the conceptual model that describes and represents the structure, behavior, and more views of a system. A system model can represent multiple views of a system by using two different approaches. The first one is the non-architectural approach and the second one is the architectural approach. The non-architectural approach respectively picks a model for each view. The architectural approach, also known as system architecture, instead of picking many heterogeneous and unrelated models, will use only one integrated architectural model. =Business process modelling= Abstraction for business process modellingColette Rolland (1993). \\"Modeling the Requirements Engineering Process.\\" in: 3rd European-Japanese Seminar on Information Modelling and Knowledge Bases, Budapest, Hungary, June 1993. In business process modelling the enterprise process model is often referred to as the business process model. Process models are core concepts in the discipline of process engineering. Process models are: * Processes of the same nature that are classified together into a model. * A description of a process at the type level. * Since the process model is at the type level, a process is an instantiation of it. The same process model is used repeatedly for the development of many applications and thus, has many instantiations. One possible use of a process model is to prescribe how things must/should/could be done in contrast to the process itself which is really what happens. A process model is roughly an anticipation of what the process will look like. What the process shall be will be determined during actual system development.C. Rolland and C. Thanos Pernici (1998). \\"A Comprehensive View of Process Engineering\\". In: Proceedings of the 10th International Conference CAiSE'98, B. Lecture Notes in Computer Science 1413, Pisa, Italy, Springer, June 1998.  Models in information system design = Conceptual models of human activity systems = Conceptual models of human activity systems are used in soft systems methodology (SSM), which is a method of systems analysis concerned with the structuring of problems in management. These models are models of concepts; the authors specifically state that they are not intended to represent a state of affairs in the physical world. They are also used in information requirements analysis (IRA) which is a variant of SSM developed for information system design and software engineering. = Logico-linguistic models = Logico-linguistic modeling is another variant of SSM that uses conceptual models. However, this method combines models of concepts with models of putative real world objects and events. It is a graphical representation of modal logic in which modal operators are used to distinguish statement about concepts from statements about real world objects and events. = Data models =  Entity‚Äìrelationship model  In software engineering, an entity‚Äìrelationship model (ERM) is an abstract and conceptual representation of data. Entity‚Äìrelationship modeling is a database modeling method, used to produce a type of conceptual schema or semantic data model of a system, often a relational database, and its requirements in a top-down fashion. Diagrams created by this process are called entity-relationship diagrams, ER diagrams, or ERDs. Entity‚Äìrelationship models have had wide application in the building of information systems intended to support activities involving objects and events in the real world. In these cases they are models that are conceptual. However, this modeling method can be used to build computer games or a family tree of the Greek Gods, in these cases it would be used to model concepts.  Domain model  A domain model is a type of conceptual model used to depict the structural elements and their conceptual constraints within a domain of interest (sometimes called the problem domain). A domain model includes the various entities, their attributes and relationships, plus the constraints governing the conceptual integrity of the structural model elements comprising that problem domain. A domain model may also include a number of conceptual views, where each view is pertinent to a particular subject area of the domain or to a particular subset of the domain model which is of interest to a stakeholder of the domain model. Like entity‚Äìrelationship models, domain models can be used to model concepts or to model real world objects and events.

A fuath ( ‚Äòhate'; fuathan; vough, vaugh) is a class of malevolent spirits in Scottish Highland folklore, especially water spirits. In Sutherland was the so-called Moulin na Vaugha/Fouadh, ‚ÄòMill of the Fuath', haunted by the fuath and her son, the amormphous brollachan. The mill was along a stream off Loch Migdale, and belonged to the Dempster family (Skibo Castle) estate. A fuath once seen at this mill was a nose-less banshee with yellow hair wearing a green silk dress; in the story of its capture it was tormented into submission by use of steel (awl, and more effectively by a sewing needle), but turned to a jellyfish-like mass when light was shone on it. A lame fuath on the estate farm had webbed feet. They sometimes reputedly intermarry with human beings (typically the female), whose offspring have developed a mane and tail.  Nomenclature  The term \\"fuath\\" has been explained to be a generic class of spirits inhabiting the sea, rivers, fresh water, or sea lochs, with several \\"subspecies\\" falling under it. An alternative name for this class of monsters is the arrachd or fuath-arrachd.  Generalization  = Aquatic nature = J. F. Campbell characterized the fuath of Sutherland as a water spirit,. He gives an amalgamated descriptions of the fuath, drawing from the main brollachan tale and variants 1.‚Äì5. He is also quoted in but it has been stressed by John Gregorson Campbell that the term designates a spectre or goblin more generally, not necessarily of aqueous nature or habitat. = Conflated description = J. F. Campbell also conflated the traits of the fuath from different accounts in a generalized description of the fuath of Sutherland and this has also fallen under criticism by the other Campbell. Furthermore, J. F. Campbell ascribed the mane and tail to the fuath, though these traits had evidently developed in the human progeny of the Munroe family, to which there was attached a floating rumour that their ancestor had interbred with a fuath several generations back. While it has been generalized that the fuath of the locality wears green, \\"golden and silken gear\\" was worn by the weird woman seen plunging into the River Shin was seen by a (games)keeper of the Charlotte Dempster's family.  Tales  \\"The Brollachan\\" (and several of its variants) from Sutherland were collected by Charlotte Dempster in 1859, and supplied to J. F. Campbell who printed it. the stories are set in spots within the Dempster family estate (otherwise known as Skibo) The writer Charlotte is a relative (granddaughter of Harriet, the illegitimate daughter of the captain). * (1) J.

The brollachan possesses eyes and mouth, but a shapeless mass of a body, and capable of speaking only two words/phrases, \\"Myself\\" and \\"Yourself\\" (mi-phrein and tu-phrein). :The brollachan was lying at the mill when the \\"Allay na Moulin\\" Murray, the resident alms-receiving crippled man around the mill came and stoked the fire with peat, causing burns on him.

The creature declared the needle was worse. Upon arrival, when the others shone light at it, it fell down, a shapeless jelly-like clump, which was much like the so-called \\"dropped stars\\" of the moors, strange objects like beached jellyfish. * (3) J.

In the book, it is an evil fresh water creature which is extremely large and covered in seaweed-like plants. It feasts of human flesh. ‚ÄúIt used to live in a bog and eat straying children.‚Äú This phrase is said by Samuel to Mercy afterwards.

It lies in what was before 1970 the Saudi‚ÄìKuwaiti neutral zone. The Japanese-owned Arabian Oil Company Ltd signed a concession agreement with the government of Saudi Arabia in December 1957 and with the government of Kuwait in July 1958 for exploration and development of hydrocarbon reserves in the offshore Neutral Zone. The Arabian Oil Company discovered the Khafji oil field in 1960 and the Hout oil field in 1963. It was only after the discovery of these oil deposits off-shore of Khafji that a permanent demarcation of the neutral zone between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia was established, with Khafji formally located within Saudi Arabia. However, the agreement concluded that both states would still maintain joint rights to all natural resources within the designated neutral zone. With the termination of the Arabian Oil Company lease to explore and extract within the area, operations within the Khafji Fields reverted to a joint venture between shareholder companies representing both states, with production being split on a 50:50 agreement between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Khafji's notoriety, however, is primarily owed to the Battle of Khafji, which took place in and around the town in 1991 and marked the high tide of Iraq's advance through Kuwait and into Saudi Arabia. Khafji's first prince was Prince Faisal bin Turki I, eldest grandson of the country's founder Ibn Saud, also known as King Abdulaziz. History Al-Khafji largely came into existence following the 1960 discovery of the Al-Khafji oil field. Following the start of commercial oil production, the Arabian Oil Company established a residential compound that was composed of 73 residential quarters, built on a total area of , and possessing drainage, electricity, piped water, cable telephones and a road network. The expansion of oil exploration and drilling in the region led the city to gradually expand, generally keeping pace with a trend witnessed throughout the Kingdom. =First Gulf War= On January 29, 1991 the Iraqi army invaded Khafji following the invasion and subsequent occupation of Kuwait. Saudi, Qatari and Coalition forces compelled the Iraqi army to withdraw from the city on the January 31, 1991 as a consequence of the Battle of Khafji. =Post-Gulf War= In 1995, city officials declared the city safe and mine-free. Location Khafji is located in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Region along the coast of the Persian Gulf. The city is situated at latitude 28-26 N, longitude 48-30 E. It is south of the Saudi-Kuwaiti border, south of Kuwait City and north of Dammam. Climate Khafji has a hot desert climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BWh). Khafji's future The Saudi government, in conjunction with Aramco Gulf Operations Company, is promoting large-scale development projects in Khafji with the goal of transforming it into one of the major cities in the country. According to the Saudi government, Khafji is to be the headquarters of a new natural gas company. A separate government project in Khafji is to promote the city as an international tourist destination. The project would publicize and promote Khafji's beaches on the Persian Gulf during the summer and the temperate weather and desert camping in the winter. Population The population of Khafji is roughly 120,000 (2015). A significant proportion of the population is composed of oil company employees and their families, and thus a large proportion of residents came to Khafji from different cities in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait after 1960. Education The city lacks institutions offering post secondary education for men. Khafji is home to the Girls Education College, a female-only college. In January 2009, Muhammed Al-Umair, Director of Colleges in the Eastern Province opened an investigation into the Girls Education College following reports of piles of garbage lying about the college going uncollected for weeks and alleged late-night break ins by Asian workers exploiting the absence of security guards and staff. Students portrayed toilets at the school as unusable, and the environment at the school was portrayed as lax to the point of being detrimental to scholastic endeavors.http://www.a1saudiarabia.com/Chaos-in-Khafji-Girls-Education- College/ The Girls Education College receives a portion of its funding from Chevron. Healthcare Until 1969, Khafji was served by a single hospital, the Company Hospital. In 1969, the Ministry of Health funded the construction of an additional two clinics. In 1988, Khafji National Polyclinic was established and turned into hospital by 2004 to be the pioneer in private medical service in the city.In 1996, Al Khafji Joint Operations Hospital (KJO Hospital) opened, and has since been expanded. Previously, KJO Hospital used to provide healthcare for 7,000 inpatient and 80,000 outpatient visits per year. Currently Khafji General Hospital- since started by the end of 2005- became the main health institute in Khafji Governorate since it provides the health care for all citizens and eligible residents in all speciality areas -regarding the rapidly growing population- and rapidly expanding every day replacing the historical role of KJO hospital. Several private hospitals And private polyclinics have also been established in Khafji to keep up with the needs of citizens and residents in the city, as well as the citizens of neighboring Kuwait, like Kingdom of medicine, Almanar complex and was most recently the launch of Alrahmah Medical Complex in 2010. Transportation =Airport= The city is served by King Fahd International Airport, although there is a small airfield in the city (Khafji Airport) owned by Aramco Gulf Operations Company that is not open for public use or commercial service. Geographically, located 230 km to the west is the nearest domestic airport offering commercial flights (Al Qaisumah/Hafr Al Batin Airport) which has limited domestic flights, however no direct road exists which makes driving distance approximately 300 km and no longer the closest airport. King Fahd International Airport in Dammam is the closest local airport with international services at a driving distance of 270 km, despite Kuwait International Airport being the closest commercial airport to the city. Culture and recreation Many residents of Khafji travel to Kuwait or, to a lesser extent, to Dammam to shop. Both cities offer a greater variety of products and large and well-established markets in contrast to the young but growing retail options in Khafji.

Founded in Hong Kong in 1850, Lane Crawford has more than 54,348 square metres of total retail space, including several physical locations throughout China, as well as an online store. Lane Crawford is a part of The Lane Crawford Joyce Group, a fashion retail and brand management group in Asia, which also includes fashion store Joyce Boutique, fashion footwear, handbags and accessories specialist Pedder Group and retail, brand management and distribution company ImagineX. History Early History In August 1850, two Scots, Thomas Ash Lane and Ninian Crawford, opened a shop in a makeshift bamboo structure on the waterfront of what is now Des Voeux Road. Since that time, Lane Crawford has occupied a number of prime retail sites along Des Voeux Road and Queen's Road Central; in the early 1900s it also had stores in Guangzhou and Shanghai in China, and Kobe and Tokyo in Japan. It has been a tailor, and outfitter, a draper, a provisions dealer, a wine and spirits merchant, an auctioneer of antiques, a baker, a restaurant and a bar. The company slogan evolved from \\"The Place to Buy Anything from a Pin to an Anchor\\" (1899) to \\"Whatever You Need, Get It at Lane Crawford's\\" (1926). After the war, Lane Crawford was forced to rebuild from scratch, and so it began to expand its import export division from foodstuffs to include luxury items such as cosmetics and pearls. By 1978, jewellery accounted for 60 percent of sales. On 3 March 1950, Lane Crawford celebrated its centenary in a roof garden cocktail party at the Hongkong Hotel. Among the distinguished guests present at the function the Governor, Sir Alexander Grantham, and Lady Grantham. ;Present Today, the focus has shifted from \\"regular\\" department store to \\"speciality\\" department store. Its stores in Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai sell womenswear, menswear, shoes & accessories, lingerie, jewellery, cosmetics, and home & lifestyle goods from around the world. In 2004, Lane Crawford launched a new style of retail store at IFC Mall. In 2007, the company opened a freestanding \\"home store\\" at Pacific Place Mall, Hong Kong, and its first modern-day store in Seasons Place Mall, Beijing. Lane Crawford's buyers became participants in European fashion shows, and the company's stores were noted for presenting brands recognised as leading designers in the West but relatively unknown in China. In 2011, Lane Crawford started an e-commerce site. In 2012, its second Beijing store was opened at the Yintai Centre. In October 2013, Lane Crawford opened its Shanghai flagship store at Shanghai Times Square. In March 2014, the Chengdu store was opened at Chengdu IFS. Online store The online business ships globally, but has been purpose- built for the China market with multiple distribution points in Greater China to ensure same-day delivery in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing, and next-day delivery in primary cities.

Adler has produced and developed a number of iconic musical artists, including Carole King, Jan & Dean, The Mamas & the Papas and The Grass Roots. King's Diamond-certified album Tapestry, produced by Adler, won the 1972 Grammy Award for Album of the Year, and is widely considered one of the greatest pop albums of all time. Adler was an executive producer of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, the longest- running theatrical film in history. He also discovered and produced comedy albums and films for Cheech & Chong. In 2006, Adler was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his achievements in music. He was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2013 as the winner, alongside Quincy Jones, of the Ahmet Ertegun Award. Career =Music= Adler was born to a Jewish family, the son of Manny and Josephine (Alpert) Adler in Chicago, Illinois in 1933 and raised in the Boyle Heights section of Los Angeles, California. His career in music began as co-manager, alongside Herb Alpert, of Jan & Dean. Adler and Alpert transitioned from managing into songwriting, composing the songs \\"River Rock\\" in 1958 for Bob \\"Froggy\\" Landers and The Cough Drops and \\"Wonderful World\\" with Sam Cooke. In 1964, Adler founded Dunhill Records. He was President and chief record producer of the label from 1964 to 1967. During this time, Adler signed The Mamas & the Papas to Dunhill, producing six top- five hits for the group, including \\"California Dreamin'\\" and \\"Monday, Monday\\". Dunhill also reached #1 on the pop charts with Barry McGuire's single \\"Eve of Destruction\\". Through additional efforts by co-producers and songwriting duo P.F. Sloan and Steve Barri, the label reached #8 on the pop charts with The Grass Roots single \\"Let's Live for Today\\". Capitalizing on Dunhill's success, Adler sold the label to ABC in 1967 and founded Ode Records, to which he signed Carole King, Spirit, Cheech & Chong, Scott McKenzie, Peggy Lipton, and others. Adler produced all of King's albums on Ode, which include four Gold, one Platinum, and one Diamond certified albums by the RIAA. King's second album for Ode, Tapestry, sold more than 25 million copies worldwide, and is widely considered one of the greatest albums of all time. Adler's work on Tapestry garnered him two Grammy Awards in 1972: Record of the Year (for producing \\"It's Too Late\\") and Album of the Year. In addition to work with his own label's artists, Adler produced a number of live albums for Johnny Rivers. In June 1967, Adler helped to produce the Monterey International Pop Festival, as well as the film version, Monterey Pop. =Film= Adler in 2007 In 1975, Adler served as executive producer of the cult classic The Rocky Horror Picture Show. After seeing The Rocky Horror Show at a theater in London, Adler bought the American rights to the show, presented it live in Los Angeles, and executive-produced the film version (adding \\"Picture\\" to the title). The movie went on to become the longest-running theatrical film in history. In 1978, Adler directed the movie Up In Smoke, starring Cheech & Chong. The movie remains a cult hit, and in 2000 Adler recorded a commentary track along with Cheech Marin for the DVD release. His 1981 film, Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains, did not make a large impact upon release but has enjoyed a long life on cable TV broadcasts. Also in 1981, Adler executive produced the follow-up to The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Shock Treatment. Personal life Adler was married to actress and singer Shelley Fabares in 1964 and produced several of her songs. They separated in 1966 but were not formally divorced until 1980. In 1973 he fathered his first son, Nic Adler, with actress Britt Ekland. In 1978 he fathered another son, Cisco Adler, with then-girlfriend Phyllis Somer. In the 1980s his son Sonny was born from a brief relationship. Today, Adler is married to former actress Page Hannah, three decades his junior. The couple has four sons: Manny, Ike, Pablo, and Oscar. Adler can often be seen sitting courtside next to Jack Nicholson at Los Angeles Lakers home games. Adler owns The Roxy Theatre with his son Nic, who operates the historic music venue on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, California. Peter Fonda based his character Terry Valentine in The Limey on Adler. In 1976, Adler and his administrative assistant were kidnapped. The two men were held for eight hours and released after $25,000 in ransom money was paid. Three suspects were arrested and sheriff's deputies later recovered $14,900 of the ransom money. Two suspects were later convicted and one suspect was later sentenced to life in prison.

History and profile The party was formed in 1907 by a group of young Tunisian intellectuals who thought that the people of Tunisia should have self- determination, rather than being a protectorate of France. The movement was inspired by the Young Turks of the Ottoman Empire and the Egyptian National Party led by Mustafa Kamil Pasha. They were French-educated and advocated for the rights of Tunisians and Frenchmen. In 1908 the party supported the establishment of a constitution for Tunisia. Although the party gained considerable support from educated and professional Tunisians, they were considered to be too close to the French by the majority of Tunisians. After violence broke out in Tunisia as a result of the Italian invasion of Tripolitania and French moves to make the Jellaz cemetery public property, the French administration clamped down on the group. Its leaders were sent into exile after the Tunis Tram Boycott and the group itself was forced underground.\\"Young Tunisians\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. They printed a newspaper called Le Tunisien.

The circle itself exists within the original bounds of the square; the names Logan Square and Logan Circle are used interchangeably when referring to the park. Originally \\"Northwest Square\\" in William Penn's 1684 plan for the city, the square was renamed in 1825 after Philadelphia statesman James Logan. The park is the focal point of the eponymous neighborhood. Logan Square was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. History Parkway Central Library and Philadelphia Family Court Building Both buildings were modeled after the H√¥tel de Crillon, and the H√¥tel de la Marine Place de la Concorde in Paris Prior to the 1800s the city developed along the Delaware River, leaving the area around Logan Square as untouched forest through the American Revolution. Over the next quarter century the square served as a pasture, graveyard, and execution grounds which hosted a gallows until the hanging of William Gross on February 7th, 1823. The City of Philadelphia leased the square to the Orphans' Society from 1821 to 1830. While some have suggested that the lease for a ‚Äúgood and noble purpose‚Äù was an aim at redirecting public attention away from its previous morbid use following Gross‚Äôs death, that is probably revisionist since the lease was executed two full years prior to the last public hanging in the ‚Äúcity of brotherly love‚Äù. In 1842 an ordinance ‚Äúmade it an offense to drive or take into Logan, Penn, or Rittenhouse squares any ‚Äòhorse, cow, cart, wagon, carriage or wheelbarrow, except by permission, or place any wood, coal, rubbish, carrion, or offensive matter within either [sic] of the squares, or to climb on the trees, fences or gates . . . or to dig up the soil or injure the grass, or to run or walk over or lie on the same.‚Äô‚ÄùBy the 1840s Philadelphia had begun a restoration of the square from its former days as a graveyard, lining the walks with trees, planting greenery and shrubbery, and constructing a wooden fence allowing the square to resemble Penn's vision of an urban green space. During this period, the city limited access to Logan Square to homeowners with property connected to the square who paid for its upkeep; the city constructed a wrought iron fence around the square in 1852. In 1864 the square was the site of the Great Sanitary Fair, a fundraising event in support of the United States Sanitary Commission to help raise money, support, and buy medicine for the Union troops during the American Civil War. President Abraham Lincoln visited the fair and donated forty-eight signed copies of the Emancipation Proclamation, which sold for $10 each. In 1881 the Pennsylvania Railroad constructed a viaduct that disconnected Logan Square and Rittenhouse Square, altering William Penn‚Äôs original plan of connectivity between the city's five squares. As early as the 19th century, the square was used as a location for concerts and other community events. Since the 1890s the city had envisioned constructing of a boulevard similar to the Parisian Champs-√âlys√©ese and in 1907 the plans were approved. The square began to transform again: the original bounds of the square‚Äî18th Street to the East, 20th Street to the West, Race Street to the South and Vine Street to the North remain intact, and the square began to more closely resemble its appearance today, distinguished by its circle. Construction began in 1917 on a plan to connect Center City with Fairmount Park which later became a segment of Benjamin Franklin Parkway. It was designed by Jacques Gr√©ber, a French landscape architect who converted Logan Square into a circle similar to the oval of the Place de la Concorde in Paris. Philadelphia even modeled its Free Library and Family Court Building after the twin buildings of the H√¥tel de Crillon and the H√¥tel de la Marine in Paris. Among the sites in its immediate vicinity are the Swann Memorial Fountain at the center of the circle, Parkway Central Library, the former Philadelphia Family Court Building, the Academy of Natural Sciences, the Franklin Institute, Moore College of Art and Design, the Roman Catholic Cathedral-Basilica of Sts. Peter and Paul, and the Mormon Philadelphia Pennsylvania Temple. The circle itself is the subject of the local band The Wonder Years' song 'Logan Circle' from their studio album The Upsides. =Recent redevelopment= In early 2005, The Pennsylvania Horticultural Society(PHS) began efforts to clean up and redevelop the park to make it more accessible and inviting to pedestrians. Most noticeably the large paulownia trees that featured prominently round the fountain were removed. City planners with PHS had determined that they had reached the end of their life span and had become an eyesore. They were replaced with similar trees grown especially for Logan Square at Longwood Gardens as part of a larger plan to improve the space. PHS planted lush perennial gardens around the fountain and adjacent parcels and maintain the gardens throughout the year. The city undertook an extensive rehabilitation plan and by 2012 the city had refurbished the original squares with restoration and new greenery bringing the Parkway‚Äôs entertainment capabilities full-circle. The city has expressed support of transitioning the circle back into a square, and increasing its aesthetic nature as an urban green space. =Events = When Pope John Paul II visited the city in 1979, he celebrated mass in the plaza on October 3, 1979. To commemorate the end of every school year since the 1960s, the newly appointed Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors of J. W. Hallahan Catholic Girls High School jump into the fountain. The event is the subject of much local media coverage throughout Philadelphia. In 2016 it was the starting location for the Women's March on Philadelphia. In April 2017, Logan Circle hosted the NFL Draft. Gallery File:Great Sanitary Fair 1864.jpgGreat Sanitary Fair, June 1864.

LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python) is a very common example of a web service stack, named as an acronym of the names of its original four open- source components: the Linux operating system, the Apache HTTP Server, the MySQL relational database management system (RDBMS), and the PHP programming language. The LAMP components are largely interchangeable and not limited to the original selection. As a solution stack, LAMP is suitable for building dynamic web sites and web applications. Since its creation, the LAMP model has been adapted to other componentry, though typically consisting of free and open-source software. For example, an equivalent installation on the Microsoft Windows family of operating systems is known as WAMP and an equivalent installation on macOS is known as MAMP.  Overview  Originally popularized from the phrase \\"Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP\\", the acronym \\"LAMP\\" now refers to a generic software stack model. The modularity of a LAMP stack may vary, but this particular software combination has become popular because it is sufficient to host a wide variety of website frameworks, such as Joomla, WordPress and Drupal. The components of the LAMP stack are present in the software repositories of most Linux distributions. The LAMP bundle can be combined with many other free and open-source software packages, such as the following: * netsniff-ng for security testing and hardening * Snort, an intrusion detection (IDS) and intrusion prevention (IPS) system * RRDtool for diagrams * Nagios, Collectd or Cacti, for monitoring. As another example, the software which Wikipedia and other Wikimedia Foundation projects use for their underlying infrastructure is a customized LAMP stack with additions such as Linux Virtual Server (LVS) for load balancing and Ceph and Swift for distributed object storages. = Variants = With the growing use of the archetypal LAMP, variations and retronyms appeared for other combinations of operating system, web server, database, and software language. For example, an equivalent installation on the Microsoft Windows operating system family is known as WAMP. An alternative running IIS in place of Apache is called WIMP. Variants involving other operating systems include MAMP (macOS), SAMP (Solaris), FAMP (FreeBSD), iAMP (iSeries) and XAMPP (cross-platform). The web server or database management system also varies. LEMP is a version where Apache has been replaced with the more lightweight web server Nginx. A version where MySQL has been replaced by PostgreSQL is called LAPP, or sometimes by keeping the original acronym, LAMP (Linux / Apache / Middleware (Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby) / PostgreSQL).  Software components  A high-level overview of LAMP's determining components (Firefox serves just as a browser example). = Linux = Linux is a Unix-like computer operating system assembled under the model of free and open-source software development and distribution. Most Linux distributions, as collections of software based around the Linux kernel and often around a package management system, provide complete LAMP setups through their packages. According to W3Techs in October 2013, 58.5% of web server market share is shared between Debian and Ubuntu, while RHEL, Fedora and CentOS together shared 37.3%. = Apache = The role of LAMP's web server has been traditionally supplied by Apache, and has since included other web servers such as Nginx. The Apache HTTP Server has been the most popular web server on the public Internet. In June 2013, Netcraft estimated that Apache served 54.2% of all active websites and 53.3% of the top servers across all domains. In June 2014, Apache was estimated to serve 52.27% of all active websites, followed by Nginx with 14.36%. Apache is developed and maintained by an open community of developers under the auspices of the Apache Software Foundation. Released under the Apache License, Apache is open-source software. A wide variety of features are supported, and many of them are implemented as compiled modules which extend the core functionality of Apache. These can range from server-side programming language support to authentication schemes. = MySQL and alternatives = MySQL's original role as the LAMP's relational database management system (RDBMS) has since been alternately provisioned by other RDBMSs such as MariaDB or PostgreSQL, or even NoSQL databases such as MongoDB. MySQL is a multithreaded, multi-user, SQL database management system (DBMS), acquired by Sun Microsystems in 2008, which was then acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2010. Since its early years, the MySQL team has made its source code available under the terms of the GNU General Public License, as well as under a variety of proprietary agreements. MariaDB is a community- developed fork of MySQL, led by its original developers. PostgreSQL is also an ACID-compliant object-relational database management system developed by PostgreSQL Global Development Group. MongoDB is a web-scale open-source NoSQL database that eschews the traditional table-based relational database structure in favor of JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas (calling the format BSON), making the integration of data in certain types of applications easier and faster. = PHP and alternatives = PHP's role as the LAMP's application programming language has also been performed by other languages such as Perl and Python. PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. PHP code is interpreted by a web server via a PHP processor module, which generates the resulting web page. PHP commands can optionally be embedded directly into an HTML source document rather than calling an external file to process data. It has also evolved to include a command-line interface capability and can be used in standalone graphical applications. PHP is free software released under the terms of PHP License, which is incompatible with the GNU General Public License (GPL) due to the restrictions PHP License places on the usage of the term PHP. Perl is a family of high-level, general- purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming languages. The languages in this family include Perl 5 and Raku. They provide advanced text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix command line tools, facilitating manipulation of text files. Perl 5 gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting language for the Web, in part due to its parsing abilities. Python is a widely used general- purpose, high-level, interpreted, programming language. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural paradigms. It features a dynamic type system, automatic memory management, a standard library, and strict use of whitespace. Like other dynamic languages, Python is often used as a scripting language, but is also used in a wide range of non-scripting contexts.  High availability and load balancing  Specific solutions are required for websites that serve large numbers of requests, or provide services that demand high uptime. High-availability approaches for the LAMP stack may involve multiple web and database servers, combined with additional components that perform logical aggregation of resources provided by each of the servers, as well as distribution of the workload across multiple servers. The aggregation of web servers may be provided by placing a load balancer in front of them, for example by using Linux Virtual Server (LVS). For the aggregation of database servers, MySQL provides internal replication mechanisms that implement a master/slave relationship between the original database (master) and its copies (slaves). Such high-availability setups may also improve the availability of LAMP instances by providing various forms of redundancy, making it possible for a certain number of components (separate servers) to experience downtime without interrupting the users of services provided as a whole. Such redundant setups may also handle hardware failures resulting in data loss on individual servers in a way that prevents collectively stored data from actually becoming lost. Beside higher availability, such LAMP setups are capable of providing almost linear improvements in performance for services having the number of internal database read operations much higher than the number of write/update operations.

His music was performed by the bands of John Philip Sousa and Edwin Franko Goldman and his march \\"The Governor's Own\\" (1921) appears as the first selection on the bicentennial album Pride of America, released by New World Records. Early life and education The St. Thomas-born son of aspiring artisan parents, Adams attended elementary school and later apprenticed to become a carpenter and then a shoemaker. During this time, he nurtured a passion for music and literature. Adams learned to play piccolo (chosen primarily because the instrument was less expensive than a full-size flute) and joined the St. Thomas Municipal Band in 1906. Simultaneously, he studied music theory and composition late into the nights through correspondence courses with Dr. Hugh A. Clark at the University of Pennsylvania. In June 1910, Adams broke away from the Municipal Band to form his own ensemble‚Äîthe Adams Juvenile Band. Adams' band developed rapidly, becoming part of the social fabric in the islands' capital city‚Äîthe port of Charlotte Amalie‚Äîby playing for a variety of social and charitable events as well as regular concerts in the city's bandstand at Emancipation Garden, a location that remembers and celebrates Governor von Scholten proclamation which gave freedom to the slaves in 1848. Adams had come to depend on music magazines from the U.S. mainland as a source of ideas and learning about music. His passion for reading and writing bore fruit as early as 1910 when he first contributed an article on the black composer Samuel Coleridge Taylor to The Dominant. In 1915, he became the music editor for the St. Croix newspaper The Herald. A year later he became the band columnist for Boston's Jacobs' Band Monthly. Bands at the time mostly performed rearrangements of orchestral music and Adams highlighted original works. Adams' essays garnered the attention of leading musicians in the States, such as John Philip Sousa and Edwin Franko Goldman. His grandiloquent prose style amplified a philosophy of social idealism about music's educational role in the community. When on the eve of its entrance into World War I, the United States purchased the Virgin Islands from Denmark, Adams possessed a unique combination of administrative skill and community service with credibility on the U.S. mainland and no problematic political entanglements that allowed him to take advantage of an unprecedented opportunity. Career On June 2, 1917, Adams and his entire Juvenile Band were inducted into the United States Navy, thus becoming the first African- Americans to receive official musical appointments in the U.S. Navy since at least the War of 1812 and making Adams the Navy's first black bandmaster. It was an exceptional situation inspired by exceptional circumstance: the need to build a bridge between an all-white naval administration and a predominantly black population. Adams used his authority as bandleader and Chief Petty Officer with the Navy as a source of power, wealth, and influence. Their induction not only helped to defuse the racial tension that plagued the Navy's presence on the island during World War I, but the band, and Adams in particular, functioned as educators to naval administrators about the needs and attitudes of Virgin Islanders. Further, Adams continued to grow into his role as a social leader on the islands, serving as an officer of the local chapter of the Red Cross, helping to found the public library in Charlotte Amalie, and developing the islands‚Äô public school music education program. He traveled to the U.S. mainland for the first time in 1922 to research music education programs, but the highpoint of his naval career was a 1924 tour of the U.S. eastern seaboard. With his U.S. Navy Band of the Virgin Islands in top form, Adams and the band won accolades from concert and radio audiences in Hampton Roads Virginia, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, New York, and Boston. Adams' music is in the style of John Philip Sousa and communicates energy along with a core patriotism. His best known works include the \\"Virgin Islands March\\" (1919), \\"The Governor's Own\\" (1921), and \\"The Spirit of the U.S.N.\\" (1924), dedicated to President Calvin Coolidge. This trip would turn out to be the apex of the band's success; the band never again enjoyed the notoriety on the U.S. mainland that its parades in Harlem had generated. In 1931 Adams's unit was transferred to Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, when the naval government of the islands was replaced by a civilian administration, thus separating Adams from family, friends, and his source of social influence. Only a dozen works from a reportedly much larger output survived a December 27, 1932, fire that destroyed Adams' St. Thomas home. The blaze killed his daughter Hazel and burnt a cache of manuscripts, both scholarly writings and unpublished compositions. In 1933 he retired into the Naval Fleet Reserve and returned to St. Thomas, not long after resuming his duties for the public school music program. A brief return to newspaper editorship for The Bulletin [St. Thomas] was cut short by World War II, when he was recalled to active duty. Sent back to Guant√°namo Bay Adams took over an all-white unit and received permission to reinstate eight former bandsmen thus creating the first racially integrated band sanctioned by the U.S. Navy. The next year Adams and the other islanders were transferred to St. Thomas to reform the original unit, again as an all- black ensemble. The band would be transferred again in 1944, this time to Puerto Rico. Adams retired from the Navy permanently in 1945. Later life and death Back in St. Thomas, Adams fused his interest in business and the community when he was appointed to the governing committee of the St. Thomas Power Authority. In 1947, he answered a call to increase the island's number of hotel rooms by opening up his home as the Adams 1799 Guest House. In 1952, Adams became a charter member of the Virgin Islands Hotel Association and was soon elected president, a position he held until 1971. During this entire period Adams served as a reporter, working as a stringer for the Associated Press as well as the Associated Negro Press and contributing regular articles to George Schuyler's Pittsburgh Courier and a host of other publications. He never ran for public office, but was closely involved in island politics as an advisor and editorial commentator. In 1963, the rededication of his composition, ‚ÄúVirgin Islands March,‚Äù to the people of the Virgin Islands was officially accepted by the islands' legislature. In 1982 it became the official territorial anthem. Adams closed his guest house around 1983 and died in Charlotte Amalie on November 23, 1987, a few weeks after his 98th birthday. Legacy Once all-but-forgotten, today Adams' story and his music are undergoing a renaissance. The United States Navy Band has rediscovered his music and a book including Adams‚Äô memoirs was published in 2007.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5pmspfG_CI Compositions =Marches= * \\"Ingolf March\\" (1910) [missing] * \\"Virgin Islands March\\" (1919) * \\"The Governor's Own\\" (1921) * \\"Spirit of the U.S.N.\\" (1924) =Waltzes= * \\"Caribbean Echoes\\" * \\"Childhood Merriment,\\" dedicated to all his children, but especially Hazel who created the main melody =Bamboulas= * \\"Bull Passin'\\" =Solos= * \\"Warbling in the Moonlight\\" (piccolo with band accompaniment) * \\"Doux R√™ve d'Amour\\" (piano, 1912) =Songs= * \\"Sweet Virgin Isles\\" (1925) * \\"Welcome to Our President\\" (1934), originally written as a song of welcome for Eleanor Roosevelt on a visit to the Virgin Islands and later revised for a visit of her husband, President Franklin D.

Zhou is viewed in Chinese history as the epitome of proper military discipline.  Early career  Zhou's father, Zhou Bo, was one of the key generals for Liu Bang during the Chu-Han Contention who would continue to play important roles in government and who was instrumental in the ascension to the throne by Emperor Jing's father Emperor Wen. For his accomplishments, Zhou Bo was created the Marquess of Jiang. After Zhou Bo died in 169 BC, his son and Zhou Yafu's older brother Zhou Shengzhi (Âë®Âãù‰πã) inherited the march, but after one year he was accused of murder and executed. In his stead, Zhou Yafu was created a marquess, but of a different march (Tiao). Later made the governor of the Commandery of Taiyuan (around modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), Zhou quickly gained the reputation of being a capable administrator and military commander. In 158 BC, when Xiongnu made a major incursion into the Commanderies of Shang (modern northern Shaanxi) and Yunzhong (modern western Inner Mongolia), Emperor Wen made a visit to the camps of armies preparing to defend the capital Chang'an against a potential Xiongnu attack. It was on this occasion that he became impressed with Zhou as a military commander -- compared to the other generals, who, upon the emperor's arrival, stopped what they were doing and did what they could to make the emperor feel welcome. In contrast, Zhou remained on military alert and required the imperial guards to submit to proper military order before he would allow the imperial train to enter. Later, Emperor Wen would leave instructions for Crown Prince Liu Qi that if military emergencies arose, he should make Zhou his commander of armed forces.  Actions during the Rebellion of the Seven States  Map showing Zhou Yafu's military campaign against the seven states After Crown Prince Qi became emperor (as Emperor Jing) in 157 BC, a military emergency did arise. Concerned that the princes of collateral lines of the imperial clan were becoming overly powerful, Emperor Jing, based on the advice of Chao Cuo, attempted to reduce the size of the principalities. Seven principalities, led by the powerful principalities of Wu (modern southern Jiangsu, northern Zhejiang, southern Anhui, and northern Jiangxi) and Chu (modern northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui) rebelled in a war later known as the Rebellion of the Seven States. In accordance with Emperor Wen's instructions, Emperor Jing made Zhou the commander of the armed forces. At that time, the Wu and Chu forces were fiercely attacking the Principality of Liang (modern eastern Henan), whose prince Liu Wu was Emperor Jing's younger brother. Emperor Jing ordered Zhou to immediately head to Liang to save the principality. Zhou refused to specifically follow that instruction, reasoning that the proper strategy would involve first cutting off the Wu and Chu supply lines, thus starving them. So he headed to the north-east of Liang and around the Wu and Chu forces to cut off their supplies. The strategy was effective. Wu and Chu, unable to capture Liang quickly and realizing that their supplies were dwindling, headed north-east to attack Zhou. After being unable to get a decisive victory against Zhou, the Wu and Chu forces collapsed from starvation. Liu Pi fled to Donghai, but the citizens killed him and sought peace with Han. Liu Wu, the prince of Chu, committed suicide. The other principalities involved were all eventually defeated. Zhou's effective strategy was praised and admired by the other generals, but not by the wealthy Prince Wu or his powerful mother, the empress dowager Dou, who would bear a grudge against Zhou for the rest of their lives because of Zhou's refusal to save him first.  Post-Rebellion career  In the aftermath of the war, Zhou was made prime minister and was well trusted by Emperor Jing. After Zhou unsuccessfully tried to persuade Emperor Jing not to depose his crown prince Liu Rong in 150 BC, however, Zhou lost the favour of the emperor. Prince Wu and Empress Dowager Dou, still bearing grudges, also attacked him incessantly whenever they could. Emperor Jing's empress Wang Zhi joined their ranks when he stood in the way of a promotion of her brother Wang Xin. The Empress Dowager wanted to create him a marquess for his intercession with the emperor after the Prince of Liang was involved in the assassination of nearly a dozen ministers (including Yuan Ang) as part of a dispute over the imperial succession. Zhou repeatedly rebuffed his candidacy as insufficiently meritorious. Zhou had a further disagreement over the policy towards Xiongnu defectors. Emperor Jing wanted to bestow them with honours to encourage future Xiongnu defections, while Zhou, who considered them to be traitors, wanted to simply let them live in obscurity. As a result, Emperor Jing removed Zhou as prime minister in 147 BC. Death During 143 BC, Zhou was summoned to dinner with the emperor. Knowing that he still had great influence within the military, Zhou arrived late. The emperor then had a large piece of meat placed before Zhou, but no chopsticks were provided to him. Zhou requested chopsticks from the Imperial attendants. Emperor Jing looked at him smiling and said, \\"Are you not satisfied?\\" Zhou realised that this was a trap, and immediately apologized and withdrew. After he left, Emperor Jing made the comment, \\"This complainer is no subject for my son when he becomes emperor!\\" Later that year, Zhou's son, in anticipation of his death, purchased old armour and weapons from the imperial armoury to serve as burial decorations. When he refused to pay the delivery workers, they retaliated by accusing Zhou of treason because at the time unauthorised purchases of weapons were treated as treason and punishable by death. Emperor Jing sent investigators to interrogate Zhou, he refused to talk to them. Offended, Emperor Jing had Zhou Yafu arrested and interrogated in prison, and the interrogator, when told by Zhou that the armour and weapons were for burial purposes, accused him of \\"underground treason\\" -- i.e. he was ready to commit treason against the spirits of the emperors after he died. Zhou, who initially wanted to commit suicide when he was arrested but was persuaded not to by his wife, eventually committed suicide in prison through starvation.  Impact on Chinese history  Zhou's legacy in history is mixed. He is greatly admired for his military strategies, but even more so for his style of military discipline. He also is admired for his honesty and integrity. Those same characteristics, however, would eventually lead to his terrible fate, for they caused him to offend powerful individuals that he could not afford to offend, including, the emperor himself. His death was also a black mark on the otherwise highly regarded reign of Emperor Jing.

He was deafened at age seven from smallpox, but did not learn to sign until he was 27, when he was taught by a deaf Italian. In 1779, he wrote what may be the first book published by a deaf person,Teresa de Cartagena, in the mid-15th century, wrote two long essays or \\"tracts\\". in which he advocated for the use of sign language in deaf education. It was in part a rebuttal of the views of Abb√© Claude-Fran√ßois Deschamps de Champloiseau, who had published a book arguing against the use of signs. Desloges explained, \\"like a Frenchman who sees his language belittled by a German who knows only a few French words, I thought I was obliged to defend my language against the false charges of this author.\\" He describes a community of deaf people using a sign language (now referred to as Old French Sign Language). The Abbe de l‚Äô√âp√©e has often been credited with the invention of sign language, but this is incorrect. Desloges' book proves that French Sign Language predates the establishment of the famous school for the Deaf in Paris and is truly the invention of deaf people. Desloges also wrote a number of well-received political books around the time of the French Revolution. The time and place of his death are unknown, but he published a book as late as 1792. Some suggest that he died in 1799. Further reading * Desloges, P.

The video game was developed by Australian company Beam Software and first released in 1993 by Data East. The game is loosely based on the novel Never Deal with a Dragon by Shadowrun co-creator Robert N. Charrette and set in the year 2050. The player takes on the role of Jake Armitage, a man suffering from amnesia after having been critically wounded by assassins. The plot then follows Jake as he attempts to uncover his own identity and the identity of the mysterious figure who wants him dead, and eventually complete his mission. Harebrained Schemes' 2013 Shadowrun Returns links the stories of this game and of Shadowrun for the Sega Genesis. A project to adapt Shadowrun for the SNES had a turbulent history between 1989 and 1993, including having been halted in mid-development before being resumed in late 1992 under a tight deadline. Its eventual lead designer was Paul Kidd, creator of Beam Software's 1992 Nightshade, elements and a feel of which he then carried on to Shadowrun. The game was a critical success, winning a number of industry awards, but was a commercial failure nevertheless. It was retrospectively acclaimed by several publications as an \\"ahead of its time\\" milestone in the history of the role-playing genre for the consoles and credited for having pioneered film noir style in video games. Gameplay Shadowrun gameplay screenshot Shadowrun is an action role-playing game (RPG) that combines the statistical factor of the original tabletop game (with minor changes) with real-time gameplay. The player is given direct control over the protagonist Jake and moves him around using the directional pad within the game's isometrically displayed world. A cursor system allows the player to scroll a pointer across the screen and perform various actions that include opening doors and passageways, examining and picking up objects, engaging in conversation with non-player characters (NPCs), and utilizing firearms and magic commands while in combat. In interacting with other characters, Shadowrun allows the player to gain information using a bank of terms. Whenever Jake hears a new and unusual term, this word is highlighted and is then added to the bank that he can use; from that point on, when speaking with NPCs, Jake is able to ask them about this new word; only in this manner can a player progress with the game. As the title of the game implies, Jake is described as a \\"shadowrunner\\", a mercenary type of character common within the Shadowrun world. The player is given the option to hire other shadowrunners as henchmen with \\"nuyen\\", the game's currency that can also be used to purchase guns and certain key items scattered throughout various locations. Combat within Shadowrun often requires sharp reflexes, as practically every screen contains hidden assassins who, from random locations, open fire on Jake; the player may retreat or must otherwise immediately find the source of the attack and respond. Enemies typically drop nuyen, while at the same time, Jake builds up \\"karma\\". If the player retires to a bed to restore health and save one's progress, karma can be allocated into different attributes, skills, and magical powers. At certain points in the game, Shadowrun allows the player to enter cyberspace. Using an item called a \\"cyberdeck\\", Jake is able to hack into computers to retrieve information, as well as gain more nuyen. During such scenes, the gameplay switches to a top-down perspective while an icon of Jake moves through cyberspace, fights intrusion programs, and retrieves data. If Jake dies in cyberspace, he dies in the outside world as well. While the setting and a lot of gameplay elements are taken from the original pen and paper variant, certain gameplay elements have been modified. One example is that the \\"Condition Monitor\\" has been replaced with a more traditional hit points system, and the removal of the \\"Essence\\" mechanic, which decreases when cyberware is installed. This would reduce a character's ability to use magic as the installation of cyberware is making one less alive, thus less in tune with magic. Plot Shadowrun is an adaptation of the FASA tabletop role- playing game of the same name. The storyline of the video game is loosely based on the first Shadowrun novel, Never Deal with a Dragon, written by Robert N. Charrette. The narrative opens in Seattle, Washington in the year 2050, where the protagonist Jake Armitage is shown being gunned down in the street. A shapeshifting vulpine figure rushes to his side and is seen casting a spell over Jake before leaving hastily as the medics arrive on the scene. Jake awakens in a morgue with complete memory loss. Soon, he is approached by the \\"Dog\\", a shamanistic totem who gives him a warning before vanishing. The rest of the story is spent investigating the events leading to Jake's shooting, learning the identity of the shapeshifter who saved him, as well the person who ordered his assassination, a mysterious crime lord named \\"Drake\\". Most of the information is found by piecing together snippets of data found by hacking various protected computer systems. Along the way, he has encounters with gangs, criminals, and magically awakened creatures while under constant threat of attack from contract killers. Jake also discovers and develops his own latent magical abilities. Apart from his totem spirit, his only allies are the hired services of shadowrunners. It is eventually revealed that Jake is a data courier who was carrying a program in a computer built inside his brain. The program was designed to destroy a malevolent artificial intelligence, which the Aneki Corporation is trying to protect. The company is being aided by Drake, who turns out to be a dragon and the mastermind behind the plot. Development The work to develop an adaptation of Shadowrun for the SNES by the Australian developer Beam Software began when Adam Lanceman, part of the company's management team, acquired the license for FASA's 1989 tabletop RPG. The project was initially headed by Gregg Barnett until he abruptly left Beam midway through the game's development to start Perfect Entertainment in the United Kingdom. The game's production was halted by Beam, but eventually resumed before its set deadline. Having been hired by Beam's parent company Melbourne House, fantasy and sci-fi writer Paul Kidd quickly took Barnett's place as lead designer. According to Kidd, the given timeframe for finishing Shadowrun for publisher Data East was very short, forcing the team to complete production in a tumultuous five and a half to six months. An avid role-player, Kidd was already familiar with the Shadowrun license, but had to utilize the storyline that his predecessor had already gotten approved. Aspects of Beam's earlier action-adventure game Nightshade, of which Kidd was the writer, director and lead designer, were used as a basis for Shadowrun; specific film noir components such as \\"dark cityscapes, dialogue-heavy exchanges, and touches of humor\\" were adapted directly from the former to the latter. To coincide with the last of these qualities, Kidd and programmer Jeff Kamenek altered the original \\"serious\\" tone of Shadowrun by replacing portions of the script and artwork with more comedic elements. According to Kidd, \\"we made improvements and changes, but the basic concepts were pretty much the same [as in Nightshade].\\" The ROM image of the first version of Shadowrun contains a much more crude script, with more sexual suggestive and violent phrases. For example, one line is changed from \\"morgue guys\\" to \\"chop shop guys\\". The game's distributor favored the less serious version for retail release, sparking indignation and conflict among Kidd and other members of Beam's staff. Kidd recalled: \\"Beam Software was a madhouse, a cesspit of bad karma and evil vibes. The war was reaching shooting level; old school creators who just wanted to make good games were being crushed down by a wave of managerial bull. It was no longer a 'creative partnership' in any way; it was 'us' and 'them'. People were feeling creatively and emotionally divorced from their projects.\\" Shadowrun was ultimately completed by its deadline. Kidd credits this to the staffers abstaining from company meetings and workshops, and continually keeping management away from the designers. Shadowrun was released in North America and Japan by Data East. In PAL regions, it was self-published by Beam Software as Laser Beam Entertainment. The 1994 Japanese version has a significantly longer introduction sequence than the English version of the game and also has a vertically uncompressed Shadowrun logo on the title screen. Other than that, it uses the same script as the North American and PAL editions, just with Japanese subtitles. Reception The game was met with a positive critical reception and good reviews. Shadowrun was given a number of awards from various publications, including the title of the Best RPG of the Year by VideoGames, Electronic Games, and Game Informer, and was a runner-up for it in GamePro (behind Secret of Mana).GamePro, issue 55 (February 1994), pages 22-27 The game was given the second place Nintendo Power Award in the category \\"Most Innovative (Super NES)\\" (it was also nominated in the category \\"For Challenge\\"), Nintendo Power describing it as \\"one of the best sci-fi games ever\\". However, the game sold poorly, partly because of low shipping numbers. Shadowrun has been positively recounted in many retrospective lists and articles. It was listed it as the 34th best SNES game by Super Play in 1996, as well as the 48th best game on any Nintendo platform by Nintendo Power in 1997.Nintendo Power 100 (September 1997) Ranking it as the 77th top SNES game in 2011, IGN commented that while Shadowrun \\"didn't quite get away from all the common RPG stereotypes\\" it was still \\"a milestone for the introduction of film noir style into the gaming industry, though, so we can forgive the game for only being 90% groundbreaking.\\" The game was also cited as an important milestone in the use of film noir style in video games by Game Informer, according to which \\"Shadowruns moody music and dark streets set the somber tone for this RPG's prying conversations and self-reflective narrative.\\" Game Informer also ranked Shadowrun as 125th place on their list of best video games of all time in 2009. IGN Australia listed Shadowrun among their favourite Australian video games in 2010, writing it was \\"without question, one of the best underexposed classics of the SNES era\\" because it presented players with \\"a mature narrative, strong characters and a dystopian backdrop\\" blended with traditional RPG elements in an \\"irresistible\\" way. That same year, 1UP.com included Shadowrun on their list of 15 games \\"ahead of their time\\" for its use of a keyword dialogue system, common to PC games but foreign to console games of the time. In 2002, GameSpot included it on the list of video games that should be remade and compared this \\"groundbreaking RPG\\" that was \\"truly ahead of its time\\" to the more recent Planescape: Torment. A remake of the game was also requested by Sam Bandah of X360, who called it a \\"rather excellent\\", \\"little-known classic\\" and \\"a cyberpunk RPG classic begging to return\\", and stated: \\"Shadowrun would be a perfect game to remake as a Mass Effect-style RPG ‚Äì perhaps with the conversation system of the sadly much-maligned Alpha Protocol.\\"Sam Bandah, Remake This‚Ä¶ Shadowrun on the SNES, NOW Gamer Network In 2012, GamesRadar ranked this \\"one incredibly unique, noir-style story\\" as the third top \\"cult-classic franchise\\" that should be rebooted similar to how X-COM was.Lucas Sullivan, The Top 7... Cult- classic franchises we‚Äôd love to see rebooted, GamesRadar, October 8, 2012 Legacy Two co-licensed role-playing video games of the same name were released around the same time by different developers and publishers: the 1994 North America-exclusive Sega Genesis title by BlueSky Software and Sega, and the 1995 Japan-exclusive Sega Mega-CD title by Group SNE and Compile. The storyline and gameplay of the SNES Shadowrun are completely different from these two games. In 2007, FASA Studio and Microsoft Studios released a multiplayer first-person shooter adaptation of the franchise for the Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. The 1998 PC RPG Alien Earth was declared a spiritual sequel to Shadownrun by Beam Software (which developed both games), with producer David Giles saying he hoped to \\"Keep the original's gameplay RPG/combat/adventure elements that people liked, but up the graphic side of it.\\" In 2012, Harebrained Schemes announced that it would be producing a new Shadowrun role-playing video game, Shadowrun Returns, to be funded through Kickstarter. As a result of the Kickstarter appeal reaching a 1.5 million dollar target, Shadowrun original creator and FASA Corporation's founder Jordan Weisman announced that the game would now feature an additional storyline tying in the new game with both the SNES game and the Sega Genesis game. This extra content was initially made available only to backers, becoming generally available some time after release.Shadowrun Returns Update #10, on Kickstarter, Retrieved 2012-10-17 The protagonist of the SNES game, Jake Armitage, is featured in Shadowrun Returns as both part of the game's main plotline and as an NPC that the player can hire to accompany them on various missions.Shadowrun Returns first gameplay video, Retrieved 2013-04-18 References External links * Category:1993 video games Category:Action role-playing video games Category:Dragons in video games Category:Shadowrun video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System-only games Category:Video games based on novels Category:Video games developed in Australia Category:Video games set in Seattle Category:Video games set in the 2050s Category:Video games with isometric graphics Category:Cyberpunk video games ","title":"Shadowrun (1993 video game)"},{"id":"2382279","text":"Green Linnet, green linnet, or Green Linnets may refer to: * Green Linnet Records, American independent record label that specialized in Celtic music * green linnet (Chloris chloris), another name for the European greenfinch * Green Linnets, 39th (Dorsetshire) Regiment of Foot nickname * Green Linnets (Ireland), Irish regiment in the American War of Independence ","title":"Green Linnet"},{"id":"2382281","text":"The Doctorate of Medicine and of Philosophy (MD‚ÄìPhD) is a dual doctoral degree for physician‚Äìscientists, combining the vocational training of the Doctor of Medicine degree with the research expertise of the Doctor of Philosophy degree; the Ph.D is the most advanced credential in the United States. Other dual degree programs, exist; such as the joint MD-JD degree; where a JD is equivalent to the MD in a corresponding Doctor of Jurisprudence (i.e. a professional degree) and Doctor of Medicine which are both professional degrees that are generally not considered doctorates internationally. The National Institutes of Health currently provides 50 medical schools with Medical Scientist Training Program grants that support the training of students in MD‚ÄìPhD programs at these institutions through tuition and stipend allowances. These programs are often competitive, with some admitting as few as two students per academic year. The MCAT score and GPA of MD‚ÄìPhD matriculants are often higher than MD only matriculants.https://www.aamc.org/download/321506/data/factstablea22.pdf  Application and admissions  MD‚ÄìPhD typically require or prefer candidates who have had a background in research, either under a professor as an undergraduate or have taken at least one gap year to work in a laboratory setting. The application process in addition to a personal statement required for MD-only applications also require two additional essays to describe why an applicant wants to pursue an MD‚ÄìPhD and an essay describing their research background.  Training programs  In the United States, MD‚ÄìPhD degrees can be obtained through dual-degree programs offered at some medical schools. The idea for an integrated training program began at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in 1956 and quickly spread to other research medical schools. In 1964, through the Chief of the Office of Program Planning and Evaluation Herbert H. Rosenberg, Ph.D., the National Institutes of Health (NIH) developed a grant to underwrite some universities' MD‚ÄìPhD programs. This funding was distributed through the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP). There are also non-MSTP funded dual-degree programs, which typically provide funding through endowment funds, research assistantships, teaching assistantships, and extramural fellowships). Non-MSTP funded dual degree programs have more flexibility and can extend to degrees other than the PhD (e.g., JD and MBA degrees). Admission to a dual degree program is not a requirement to receive MD and PhD degrees. An individual has the option to complete each degree separately through single-degree programs. However, the student is responsible for all medical school tuition and does not receive a stipend during their MD education. Furthermore, since the PhD training is not streamlined with the medical training, students will often take additional years to complete their PhD. A PhD may also be obtained by physicians during the residency training period. This combined research and graduate-level medical education are offered by a minority of residency programs. This additional education typically extends the residency period by three to four years. Training structure =Pre-doctoral= Upon matriculating in an MD‚ÄìPhD program, students will often follow a 2-PhD-2 plan. In this system, students will complete the pre-clinical curriculum of their medical school (2 years), transition into PhD graduate training (3‚Äì5 years), and then finally complete clinical rotations (2 years). =Post-doctoral= Upon receiving the MD‚ÄìPhD dual degree, physician-scientists may choose a variety of career paths. The most common continues to be residency training with additional laboratory training. However, a physician‚Äìscientist may also elect to refuse residency training, thereby having a career essentially akin to a conventional PhD scientist. A physician‚Äìscientist may also elect to work in the private sector with no further formal academic clinical nor research training. Benefits of the dual degree program =Financial compensation= Some MD‚ÄìPhD programs (all MSTPs) cover all medical school tuition, provide a stipend, and cover health insurance expenses. =Residency programs= Candidates with MD‚ÄìPhD dual degrees are favorably looked upon in most residency programs. =Career flexibility= Graduates with an MD‚ÄìPhD degree are generally qualified for a variety of careers in medicine and medical research. MD students, just as MD- PhD students, are also qualified for a career in medical research given enough post-graduate research experience. The issue is that careers in medicine as an MD, most commonly being a physician, pay significantly more than careers in medical research. Those who graduate MD most often accrue significant financial debt and are incentivize to seek employment as a high-paying physician to pay off debt from undergraduate and MD schooling. MD-PhD graduates nearly always graduate debt free. Thus, MD-PhD students do not have the same economic pressures to seek employment as a physician compared to their MD counterparts, and instead have the economic flexibility to seek out a career in research or any career path that can utilize the unique skills a MD- PhD had acquired over their years of education. Career paths The vast majority (over 80%) of MD‚ÄìPhD graduates eventually choose to enter academia, government, or industry where medical research is a central component of their duties. According to a FASEB study conducted in 2000, graduates of NIH-funded MSTPs make up just 2.5% of medical school graduates each year, but after graduation, account for about one third of all NIH research grants awarded to physicians. Many MD‚ÄìPhD graduates also practice clinical medicine in their field of expertise.

WEDR has an unusually wide music selection for a mainstream urban-formatted radio station that ranges from typical hip-hop and R&B; to reggaeton. This is because South Florida is a very diversified region that has various music tastes. WEDR's studio is located in Hollywood, Florida. The station is owned by Cox Media Group alongside sister stations WHQT, WFEZ and WFLC. WEDR has an unusually shaped coverage area due to the station's decision to move its antenna from a class C to a class C1 on a new tower near Miami Gardens. This change was made primarily to avoid interfering with adjacent frequencies that serve southwestern Florida. It also began broadcasting in IBOC digital radio, using the HD Radio system from iBiquity in Summer 2005.http://hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?id=12 HD Radio Guide for Miami-Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood History 1963 - The WEDR call letters have been in South Florida since 1963 when the station's then owner Ed Rivers acquired them from an AM radio station in Birmingham, Alabama. WEDR-FM had rock and country music formats. 1970 - WEDR adopts a black format. The station had a weak signal that couldn't cover all of Dade county, but it fared well because it was the only black station in the market. 1988 - WHQT drops its pop/dance format and adopts an Urban Contemporary format. According to the Miami Herald, \\"WEDR dipped to a low ranking of 24th in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale market, and was eulogized as an outmoded, black-run David squashed beneath the foot of a corporate white Goliath.\\" 1990 - WEDR changed slogans from \\"Starforce 99\\" to \\"99 JAMZ\\", an Urban Contemporary with a notoriously wide variety playlist that ranged from R&B;, Soul, and rap to Reggae on the weekends. April 21, 1990 - The station's signal was increased from 16 kilowatts at 175 feet to 92 kilowatts at 1,014 feet. 99 Jamz becomes a factor in the West Palm Beach-Boca Raton market. The signal reaches as far as the Caribbean. 1992 - 99 Jamz becomes the top rated station in the Miami-Ft. Lauderdale market. Traffic Reporting for WEDR was handled by George Sheldon from 1990-1997. 2003 - Program Director and morning drive host, James T, migrates to sister station WHQT. James T. had been at WEDR for twenty years. WEDR began to skew more towards current format being a Mainstream Urban with the slogan \\"99 JAMZ, South Florida's Number One For All of Today's Hip Hop and R&B;\\", then to \\"99 JAMZ, South Florida's Number One For More Of Today's Hip Hop and R&B;\\" to compete with it new crosstown rival, Clear Channel-owned WMIB, \\"103.5 the Beat\\" (now an adult-hits format radio station). However, they do still play slower R&B; and Classic Soul songs during Night JAMZ show in the overnight hours, despite most of them played on sister station WHQT. As a result of the change, Cedric Hollywood then hired radio Veteran Lorenzo \\"Ice- Tea\\" Thomas from the Washington, DC Market to do the Afternoon Jump-Off. Today, WEDR is exclusively rivaled at WPOW (Power 96). July 2004 - 99 Jamz launches the Big Lip Bandit Morning Show featuring Supa Cindy and Benji Brown (produced by Marcus \\"Wiiz\\" Johnson) 2005 - 99 Jamz kicks-off the highly anticipated, number one night show in South Florida \\"The Take Over\\" with K. Foxx and DJ Khaled. In July 2009, K. Foxx left to do Morning's for New York's Hot 97. October 2006 - WEDR's General Manager announces, Derrick Baker as Program Director of 99 Jamz March 2008 - 99 Jamz is NOW known as 99Jamz South Florida's ONLY Station for Hip Hop and R&B.; WEDR continues to dominant the South Florida Market, with format changes from former competitor WMIB, what is now a Spanish station. July 2008 - 99 Jamz launches the nationally syndicated \\"Rickey Smiley Morning Show\\" with Ebony Steele, HeadKrack, Gary, Rock T and Special K, with Miss Kimmy, Benji Brown and Marcus E.

The team currently competes in the Papua New Guinea National Rugby League Competition.  History  The club competed in the Panasonic Cup in 1986, 1987, 1988 and 1989. In 1990, they joined the new competition SP Cup where they won 3 premierships, up until 1995. They joined the Queensland Cup competition in 1996 and 1997. Due to the cost of transportation to and from Australia they were not invited to compete in the Queensland Cup for 1998. They returned to the SP Cup in 1999 for one season, before being demoted to the Port Moresby Domestic Competition. Another franchise Club that represented Port Moresby in the semi-professional competition was the Port Moresby Brian Bell Bulldogs. Richard Sinamoi, William Bussil Junior, Paul Komboi, and POMRFL Chairman Solomon Ravu orchestrated the re-entry of the Vipers in the national competition, during the SP Cup transition period to Bemobile Cup in 2008. The Vipers ended with the wooden spoon in its maiden year returning to the high level national competition, but finished strongly in the following seasons (7th in 2009, and 5th in 2010). When Digicel took the naming rights of the national competition, the Vipers finished 5th in 2011, and 4th in 2012. The team eventually became premiers, winning the cup in 2013. Sponsorship and merchandise arrangements were accumulated over time. The principal owners of the franchise, the National Capital District Commission started a partnership with Civil Pacific Engineering (CIVPAC) Limited in 2008-2010. From 2011, a partnership with City Pharmacy Limited Group under its merchandising brand name \\"Stop & Shop\\" Supermarkets was formed.

The southern terminus of the route is located at Interstate 690 (I-690) exit 3 near the interchange between I-690 and the New York State Thruway (I-90) in Van Buren, northwest of Syracuse. The northern terminus is located at an intersection with NY 104 in Oswego. In between, NY 48 passes through the riverside communities of Baldwinsville and Fulton and runs alongside both the Seneca River and Oswego River. For most of its route, NY 48 serves as an alternate route of NY 481\\\\. The routes share similar alignments along the Oswego River from the Syracuse area to Oswego, with NY 481 following the eastern riverbank between the two locations. When the route was originally assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, it extended southward into downtown Syracuse. NY 48 was truncated to Van Buren after I-690 was built over portions of the road in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The portion of former NY 48 that was not supplanted by I-690 was turned over to Onondaga County; however, the state reacquired the segment adjacent to the New York State Fairgrounds in 1980. Around 1931, a suffixed spur of NY 48, New York State Route 48A was designated as an alternate from Oswego to the town of Minetto. The route was deleted from the state highway system around 1940. Route description NY 48 southbound at NY 31 and NY 370 in Baldwinsville NY 48 begins at I-690 exit 3 just west of the Geddes town line in Van Buren, Onondaga County. Known as State Fair Boulevard, it proceeds west-northwest, paralleling both NY 690 (the northward continuation of I-690) and the Seneca River as it passes south of the Seneca Golf Club and Community Park. Shortly after passing the park, NY 48 enters the village of Baldwinsville on Syracuse Street and intersects Downer Street, the former routing of NY 31 west of the village. Originally, NY 31 overlapped NY 48 across the Seneca River (here part of the Erie Canal) to Genesee Street; now, however, NY 48 continues alone to Genesee, where it intersects the modern routing of NY 31 (concurrent with NY 370) through Baldwinsville. North of NY 31 and NY 370, NY 48 becomes Oswego Street and turns northwest before traveling south of Lysander Park as it exits the village and becomes Oswego Road. In the town of Lysander, NY 48 overlaps NY 631 for a short distance westward to an intersection with the northern end of NY 690\\\\. Here, NY 48 turns north, and begins to run as an alternate to NY 481\\\\. Both routes run from the Syracuse area to downtown Oswego. NY 48 runs right along the western side of the Oswego River, while NY 481 runs along the eastern side of the river. Both routes run through downtown Fulton and Oswego which are the two cities along the Oswego River. At several points, all that separates the two routes is the river itself. Northern terminus of NY 48 at NY 104 in Oswego Further north in Lysander, NY 48 crosses the CSX Transportation-owned Baldwinsville Subdivision before turning to the northeast as it passes through the hamlet of Wrights Corners and entering Oswego County. Just past the county line in Granby, the route turns northwest, following the western bank the Oswego River (and paralleling County Route 57 or CR 57 on the opposite side) as it intersects CR 46 near the hamlet of Hinmansville. NY 48 continues along the riverbank to the city of Fulton, where it gains the name West First Street south of an intersection with NY 176\\\\. Like NY 31 in Baldwinsville, NY 48 originally overlapped NY 176 north to NY 3 (Broadway), where NY 176 continued east. Now, however, NY 176 ends here and NY 48 continues solo to NY 3\\\\. Past Broadway, NY 48 proceeds north through the remainder of Fulton, now paralleling NY 481 extremely close with just Oswego River separating the two. Midway between Fulton and the Minetto hamlet of the same name, NY 48 serves Battle Island State Park, named for a small island in the Oswego River a short distance to the north. NY 48 presses onward along the edge of the Oswego to the hamlet of Minetto, where it intersects CR 24, formerly NY 48A. North of the hamlet, NY 48 passes by the Oswego Country Club as it enters the Oswego city limits. Once in the City of Oswego, NY 48 becomes West First Street. At Utica Street, NY 48 briefly turns west before turning back north at West Fifth Street and terminating at NY 104 (Bridge Street). West First Street continues north for an additional six blocks to the Lake Ontario shoreline. NY 48 is city-maintained within the cities of Fulton and Oswego; the rest of the highway is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). History NY 48 southbound at NY 3 in Fulton In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 48 was assigned to a previously unnumbered roadway between downtown Syracuse and Oswego. From Van Buren north to Oswego, NY 48 roughly followed its modern alignment;Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930‚Äì31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering south of Van Buren, NY 48 was routed on State Fair Boulevard and Geddes Street to terminate at NY 5, then routed on Erie Boulevard. The route was realigned slightly within Syracuse between 1938 and 1940 to use portions of Hiawatha Boulevard and West Genesee Street (as well as a new portion of State Fair Boulevard) to meet NY 5 at the modern intersection of Erie Boulevard and Genesee Street. The portion of the New York State Thruway from Rochester east to the Westmoreland hamlet of Lowell opened on June 24, 1954. At the time, exit 39 connected directly to NY 48\\\\. As early as 1954, plans were drawn up to construct a freeway along the NY 48 corridor between the Thruway and NY 48 at the New York State Fairgrounds just northwest of the Syracuse city limits. Construction on the highway, situated between NY 48 and Onondaga Lake, began in the mid-1950s and was completed by 1961. Other areas of State Fair Boulevard (NY 48) were upgraded into limited-access highways, including at Thruway exit 39 and in downtown Syracuse. As a result, NY 48 was truncated to its present southern terminus at the freeway, designated as I-690, in Van Buren. Following the removal of NY 48 south of the Thruway, the portion of State Fair Boulevard from the Syracuse city line north to I-690 exit 5 in Geddes became CR 80. On April 1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of CR 80 between I-690 exits 6 (NY 695) and 7 (NY 297) was transferred to the state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the state and Onondaga County. This segment, in length, is now designated as NY 931B, an unsigned reference route. The remainder of State Fair Boulevard within Geddes is still designated as CR 80 even though the designation now exists in two parts. NY 48A NY 48A was a designation assigned to an alternate route of NY 48 between the city of Oswego and the Minetto hamlet of the same name. It was assigned and began at the modern junction of NY 48 and CR 24 in Minetto. From there, it proceed west on what is now CR 24 and north on West Fifth Street (partly CR 25) to Oswego, where NY 48A reconnected to its parent by way of Niagara Street. The designation was removed .

The municipality, located in a mountainous area of the country, covers an area of 135.60 km¬≤ and as of 2006 had an approximate population of 24,000. It has historical importance since it played a fundamental role as a site for negotiations and battles between guerrillas and the government during Civil War of El Salvador. Much of the municipality is mountainous and has a thriving artisan community. It is one of the most notable centres of craft in the country and the revenue generated from crafts through tourism and exports are crucial to the economy. History Arising from the colonial period, the name derives from a place formerly called the Palmita, a small village in the area located near Nonuapa River. After a flood of that river in 1882, their settlers moved to the present place and founded La Palma. In 1959 by Legislative Decree, it became a town and municipality, consisting of the cantons of Los Horcones, Los Planes, Las Granadillas, El Gramal, San Jos√© Sacar√©, El T√∫nel, El Aguacatal and San Josecalera. The area has great relevance in the History of El Salvador since it played a prominent role in the solution of civil war. From 1980, the municipality was a platform of the ideological work of the guerrillas and later, it served as a battleground for combat between the insurgents and the army. On October 15, 1984, the president Jose Napole√≥n Duarte and the leaders of the Frente Farabundo Mart√≠ para la Liberaci√≥n Nacional (FMLN) had their first encounter, initiating the treaty that would culminate with Peace Accords of Chapultepec. Geography The municipality covers an area of approximately 131,89 km ¬≤. Its jurisdictional borders are: to the north with San Ignacio, to the south with Agua Caliente, the east with Honduras and the municipalities of San Fernando, San Francisco Moraz√°n and La Reina, and to the west with Metapan and Cital√°, borders by the Lempa River. La Palma is part of the mountainous zone of El Salvador, enjoying a cool climate. Administratively, the municipality is divided in 8 cantons and 87 small villages (caserios) in the rural area and 6 districts in the urban area. On July 1 of 1956, it was estimated that the population of La Palma was 5,337, 2,780 male and 2,957 female. In 2006, however it was calculated that municipality of La Palma had a total population of 24,000 inhabitants in the urban and rural areas.  Weather  Climate Economy The economy of La Palma is based principally on the arts and crafts. 75% of the population lives off this trade and the revenue from tourism. The other 25% is involved in agriculture, the primary crops being vegetables, corn, beans and coffee. =Arts= Locally made earrings Partly made with mud In the 1970s, Fernando Llort developed the arts in the municipality, developing an artisan industry that is the main employer in La Palma. There are around 100 crafts factories in the locality, half of which are dedicated to export. The growth of the artisan export in the municipality does not correspond to the national trend. = Agriculture = Coffee production is, according to the municipal economic report of 2006, the second most important industry in La Palma, although it has been decreasing due to the strong competition of foreign producers. In 1988, coffee production accounted for over half of El Salvador's revenue from exports, whereas for 2004 it has fallen dramatically to just 7%. =Tourist attractions= The Miramundo Forest *13 kilometers outside La Palma town is Miramundo.

The municipality is bordered to the north by Ojos de Agua, to the east by Las Flores, to the south by Chalatenango, and to the northeast by Concepci√≥n Quezaltepeque. The territory covers 36.83 km¬≤ and the population was, as of 2005, of 2,101 inhabitants. For its administration, the municipality is divided into six cantones and 35 caser√≠os. History According to the information preserved by tradition, Las Vueltas was founded in 1765 by emigrants from Chalatenango. By legislative decree on May 12, 1902, the then municipality of La Ceiba was abolished and changed into a cant√≥n in the municipality of Las Vueltas. A new law, that of April 23, 1906, reinstated El Zapotal as part of Las Vuelas and also moved the prosperous cantones of La Ceiba and La Laguna to Chalatenango. Another legislative decree, on April 8, 1943, moved these two cantones out of the jurisdiction of Chalatenango and also shifted the cantones of El Zapotal and El Coyolar to Ojos de Agua. Due to the repression of the landowners, in 1931 farmers and indigenous citizens began a rebellion (Lonely Planet). The army responded by killing 30,000 people, including the leader of the rebellion, Farabundo Mart√≠, in a bloody act that was later referred to as La Matanza (The Massacre) (Lonely Planet). But the people remained unhappy with the government. This began a movement organized around leftist guerrillas to combat the repression violence (Stahler-Sholk, 1994:2). The government responded with violence, and the Death Squads were formed, which eventually torturing and killed thousands of people (Foley 2006). More political instability and the assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero in 1980 sparked the beginning of the Civil War (Lonely Planet). This war, which lasted 12 years, resulted in the death of an estimated 75,000 people and the displacement of thousands more (Stahler-Sholk, 1994:3). The Peace Accords were signed on January 16, 1992 (Embajada). The department of Chalatenango was heavily impacted by the Civil War. Many people of Las Vueltas were forced to abandon their homes because of the violence. But beginning in the early 1990s, and especially after the Peace Accords, the people have returned to repopulate the municipality.

Main sights =Tourist sites= * Sumpul River, where it enters in Cant√≥n El Conacaste * El Volc√°n / El Conacaste and la Bola are known as \\"the boiler\\" because there is natural hot water. * Above Tamulasco River there are various natural pools: La Sirena, etc. =Archaeological sites= * In Sicahuite there is stone art (petroglyphs) and archaeological material. * In Plan de Barro there is stone art. * In Las Vueltas and El Conacaste, there is stone art. * In Los Naranjos there is stone art. The petroglyphs run in some sort of \\"line\\", perhaps from north to south passing through El Zapotal, El Tablon and on up to San Juan Olosingo at the border of Honduras. They are largely Lenca drawings. Agricultural production The people of Las Vueltas grow corn, beans, and sorghum. The majority, if it is a good crop, is for family sustenance; little is sold. The fields also produce melons, cucumbers, and squash. =Food and dinks= Traditional foods include beans, tortillas, metas, soups, sweets, and seeds. Other traditional foods and dishes include: * A variety of pupusas (stuffed corn tortillas) * Tamales * Coffee of corn of sorghum * Soups made with local vegetables * Sweetened ayote, a local squash * Atole of fruits * Natural fruit juices of local fruits, such as nance The majority of the ingredients used to make these foods and drinks are natural and are grown in the area. They also form part of the biodiversity that, in some cases, is threatened or in danger of extinction. Nevertheless, these habits are less common as more people eat commercially produced foods.

Television Distribution and premiered on September 5, 1994. The program serves as a straight rundown of news headlines and gossip throughout the entertainment industry, providing coverage of events and celebrities; however, since 2013, it has also placed an even greater emphasis on interviews and insider previews of upcoming film and television projects. , the program's weekday broadcasts are anchored by Billy Bush, with the weekend editions anchored by Renee Bargh and Jennifer Lahmers. History Victory Studios, where Extra was produced from 1994 to 2010. The series was developed in the fall of 1993, for a planned launch during the 1994‚Äì95 television season. The program was developed under the working title Entertainment News Television; however due to claims that it too closely mirrored its own name, cable channel E!: Entertainment Television filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. Television and Telepictures Productions to bar them from using the title; although E! lost the lawsuit in a summary judgment hearing allowing Warner Bros. to continue to use the ENT title for the series, Warner Bros. decided to change the name of the program to Extra: The Entertainment Magazine in May 1994, four months before the series made its debut, with Warner Bros. executives citing that the abbreviated ENT title itself would be too similar to that used by Entertainment Tonight, long shortened officially to just ET, possibly leading to viewer confusion and confusing A.C. Nielsen ratings diary homes which would have seen their panelists writing down the wrong program they watched. The program was initially anchored by Dave Nemeth and Arthel Neville. Neville joined the program after being anchor at New Orleans ABC affiliate WVUE-TV (now a Fox affiliate) and a three-year run on Extreme Close-Up, a one-on-one celebrity interview show that she co-produced for E! Entertainment TV. Extra was initially distributed by Time-Telepictures Television, a joint venture between Time Inc. and Telepictures ‚Äì both of which were owned at the time by Time Warner (which would eventually spin off Time Inc. in 2012) ‚Äì that was absorbed by Telepictures in 2003. Nemeth and Neville were both replaced by Brad Goode and Libby Weaver on June 10, 1996 for the remainder of Season 2, and Season 3 (which premiered on September 9, 1996), before Weaver was replaced by Maureen O'Boyle in July 1997 during Season 3. O'Boyle took over as main anchor of the program in September 1997 during season 4 premiere; following O'Boyle's departure in September 2000, former Entertainment Tonight anchor/correspondent and talk show host Leeza Gibbons became its main anchor of season 7. In September 2002, Telepictures debuted a spin-off series, Celebrity Justice. The program, which was hosted and executive produced by Harvey Levin, had originated as a segment featured on Extra that focused on legal issues involving celebrities and high-profile court cases with little to no relation to the entertainment industry; Celebrity Justice ran for three seasons before being cancelled in 2005 (Levin would subsequently launch the celebrity news website TMZ and three years later, partner with Telepictures and Warner Bros. Television Distribution on a more successful entertainment newsmagazine venture spun off from the site, TMZ on TV). Following Gibbons's departure in 2004, Extra switched to a two-anchor format for the weekday editions with Sugar Ray lead singer/founder Mark McGrath and correspondent Dayna Devon (who was formerly a news anchor/reporter at ABC affiliates KMID and WPTY-TV) taking over as presenters. In September 2007, the production staff of Extra also began handling production responsibilities for CW Now, a weekly lifestyle newsmagazine that aired as part of The CW's Sunday night lineup; that program was cancelled due to low ratings in February 2008, after 18 episodes, continuing to broadcast some CW interstitial segments for several more months after. On July 28, 2008, Telepictures announced that actor Mario Lopez would take over as solo host of the program; Dayna Devon was moved to a correspondent role, while Mark McGrath chose to leave the show and return to his music career. On September 13, 2010, the date of the program's 17th-season premiere, Extra became the fourth American syndicated newsmagazine to begin broadcasting in high definition, after Entertainment Tonight, The Insider and Access Hollywood; the program also abandoned its longtime soundstage at Victory Studios in Glendale, California and moved its taping location to The Grove at Farmers Market, a well-known shopping and entertainment venue in Los Angeles. On August 4, 2011, Telepictures announced that Maria Menounos (who had previously served as a correspondent for rivals Entertainment Tonight and Access Hollywood) would join Extra as Lopez's co-host, as part of an overall deal with Warner Bros./Telepictures that included a role as a contributor for the CW talk show Dr. Drew's Lifechangers and development of television program projects. On September 9, 2013, at the beginning of its 20th season, Extra moved its taping location to Universal Studios Hollywood and its CityWalk; at that time, following Menounos's decision to leave Extra to become co-host of E! News, actress/producer Tracey Edmonds and SportsNation-turned-Fox Sports Live co-host Charissa Thompson were added to replace her as co-hosts. Edmonds later left in June 2017. Thompson left at the end of the program's 23rd season. On August 7, 2017, Telepictures announced co-host changes in preparation for the program's 24th season: former host/correspondent Tanika Ray would return to Extra as weekday co-host, with correspondents A.J. Calloway and current weekend edition host Renee Bargh also becoming weekday co-hosts. All join fellow host Mario Lopez. British TV personality Mark Wright will also join as weekday correspondent. Jerry Penacoli serves as an off-air correspondent for the series and is rarely seen, voicing most of the show's segments and stories that are not done from CityWalk. On May 8, 2019, Telepictures announced a revamp for the program's 26th season, starting September 9, 2019; former Access Hollywood host Billy Bush will join as co- host, replacing Mario Lopez‚Äîwho himself will move to rival Access Hollywood. It will also move to the former NBC lot in Burbank where Access had previously been based. In the months before, Telepictures had signed an agreement with Fox Television Stations to move the series in a number of major top-10 to top-50 markets to syndication on Fox stations, ending a long-term agreement with NBC Owned Television Stations to syndicate the series to NBC's owned and operated stations. On July 31, 2019, Calloway was terminated from Extra after a number of sexual harassment and assault allegations not involving show staff surfaced (he had previously been suspended earlier in February). With Bush's arrival, the series was expected to be retitled Extra Extra for the new season (the show's title theme had long had \\"Extra!...Extra!\\" as its main focal point, supporting the possible change in branding); however like the same issues the series ran into in 1994, it ran into legal issues preventing the change. ExtraExtra Show Daily, an entertainment industry expo trade publication, had utilized the title since 1997 under a registered trademark. EESD owner Sandra Driggin notified Telepictures about possible confusion with her publication, a week before the show's premiere, and threatened legal action if the show aired as Extra Extra. Telepictures ultimately decided to retain the Extra name as-is, as the show's staff had not really taken up the new name behind the scenes during off-air rehearsals with Bush. On August 27, 2020, it was announced that the twenty-seventh season will premiere on September 8, 2020.

Overview  = Anarchist opposition to nationalism = Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, the first person to call himself an anarchist in a positive sense, opposed nationalism, arguing that the \\"end of militarism is the mission of the nineteenth century, under pain of indefinite decadence\\".Woodcock, George. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. p. 233. Proudhon argued that under his proposed mutualism \\"[t]here will no longer be nationality, no longer fatherland, in the political sense of the words: they will mean only places of birth. Man, of whatever race or colour he may be, is an inhabitant of the universe; citizenship is everywhere an acquired right\\".Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century. p. 283. Anarchism has supported both anationalism and the Esperanto language. After the Spanish Civil War, Francoist Spain persecuted anarchists and Catalan nationalists, who made extensive use of Esperanto. Anationalism (Esperanto: sennaciismo) is a term originating from the community of Esperanto speakers which passed to anarchism from there. It denotes a range of cosmopolitan political concepts that combine some or all of the following tendencies and ideas, namely radical anti-nationalism, universalism, \\"one- world-ism\\", acceptance of the historic trend toward linguistic homogenization on a world scale and in some cases even a striving to accelerate that trend, the necessity of political education and organization of the world proletariat in accordance with those ideas and the utility of Esperanto as an instrument of such political education. A critique of nationalism from an anarchist point of view is Rudolf Rocker's 1937 book Nationalism and Culture. American anarchist Fredy Perlman wrote a number of pamphlets that were strongly critical of all forms of nationalism, including Anti-Semitism and the Beirut Pogrom (a critique of Zionism)Perlman, Fredy (1983). Anti-Semitism and the Beirut Pogrom by Fredy Perlman. Detroit: Black & Red. . and The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism in which Perlman argues that nationalism is a process of state formation inspired by imperialism which capitalists, fascists and Leninists use as a mean of controlling their subjects.Perlman, Fredy (1985). The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism. Detroit: Black & Red. . In 1984, Perlman also wrote a work in the post-left anarchist tradition on the subject of nationalism called The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism. In it, Perlman argues that \\"[l]eftist or revolutionary nationalists insist that their nationalism has nothing in common with the nationalism of fascists and national socialists, that theirs is a nationalism of the oppressed, that it offers personal as well as cultural liberation\\". To challenge these claims and in his view \\"to see them in a context\\", Perlman asks \\"what nationalism is - not only the new revolutionary nationalism but also the old conservative one\\". Perlman concludes that nationalism is an aid to capitalist control of nature and people regardless of its origin. Nationalism provides a form through which \\"[e]very oppressed population can become a nation, a photographic negative of the oppressor nation\\" and that \\"[t]here's no earthly reason for the descendants of the persecuted to remain persecuted when nationalism offers them the prospect of becoming persecutors. Near and distant relatives of victims can become a racist nation-state; they can themselves herd other people into concentration camps, push other people around at will, perpetrate genocidal war against them, procure preliminary capital by expropriating them\\". = Mikhail Bakunin and nationalism = Anarchist theorist Mikhail Bakunin, who embraced nationalist causes such as pan-Slavism and Siberian separatism before proclaiming himself an anarchist Prior to his involvement with the anarchist movement, Mikhail Bakunin had a long history of involvement in nationalist movements of various kinds. In his Appeal to the Slavs (1848), Bakunin called for cooperation between nationalist revolutionary movements across Europe (both Slavic and non-Slavic) to overthrow empires and dissolve imperialism in an uprising of \\"all oppressed nationalities\\" which would lead to a \\"Universal Federation of European Republics\\".Bakunin 1848. Bakunin also agitated for a United States of Europe, a contemporary nationalist vision originated by revolutionary Italian nationalist and fellow socialist Giuseppe Mazzini.Knowles n.d. Later exiled to eastern Siberia, Bakunin became involved with a circle of Siberian nationalists who planned to separate from the Russian Empire. They were connected with his cousin and patron Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky, the Governor General of Eastern Siberia, whom Bakunin defended in Alexander Herzen's journal The Bell.Billingsley n.d. It was not until a full four years after leaving Siberia that Bakunin proclaimed himself an anarchist. Max Nettlau remarked of this period in his life that \\"[t]his may be explained by Bakunin's increasing nationalist psychosis, induced and nourished by the expansionist ideas of the officials and exploiters who surrounded him in Siberia, causing him to overlook the plight of their victims\\".Nettlau 1953. = National-anarchism = Among the first advocates of national-anarchism were Hans Cany, Peter T√∂pfer and former National Front activist Troy Southgate, founder of the National Revolutionary Faction, a since disbanded British-based organization which cultivated links to certain far-left and far-right circles in the United Kingdom and in post-Soviet states, not to be confused with the national-anarchism of the Black Ram Group. In the United Kingdom, national-anarchists worked with Albion Awake, Alternative Green (published by former Green Anarchist editor Richard Hunt) and Jonathan Boulter to develop the Anarchist Heretics Fair. Those national- anarchists cite their influences primarily from Mikhail Bakunin, William Godwin, Peter Kropotkin, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Max Stirner and Leo Tolstoy. A position developed in Europe during the 1990s, national-anarchist groups have seen arisen worldwide, most prominently in Australia (New Right Australia/New Zealand), Germany (International National Anarchism) and the United States (BANA). National-anarchism has been described as a radical right-wing nationalist ideology which advocates racial separatism and white racial purity. National-anarchists claim to syncretize neotribal ethnic nationalism with philosophical anarchism, mainly in their support for a stateless society whilst rejecting anarchist social philosophy. The main ideological innovation of national-anarchism is its anti-state palingenetic ultranationalism. National-anarchists advocate homogeneous communities in place of the nation state. National-anarchists claim that those of different ethnic or racial groups would be free to develop separately in their own tribal communes while striving to be politically meritocratic, economically non-capitalist, ecologically sustainable and socially and culturally traditional. Although the term national-anarchism dates back as far as the 1920s, the contemporary national-anarchist movement has been put forward since the late 1990s by British political activist Troy Southgate, who positions it as being \\"beyond left and right\\". The few scholars who have studied national- anarchism conclude that it represents a further evolution in the thinking of the radical right rather than an entirely new dimension on the political spectrum. National-anarchism is considered by anarchists as being a rebranding of totalitarian fascism and an oxymoron due to the inherent contradiction of anarchist philosophy of anti-fascism, abolition of unjustified hierarchy, dismantling of national borders and universal equality between different nationalities as being incompatible with the idea of a synthesis between anarchism and fascism. National-anarchism has elicited skepticism and outright hostility from both left-wing and far-right critics. Critics, including scholars, accuse national-anarchists of being nothing more than white nationalists who promote a communitarian and racialist form of ethnic and racial separatism while wanting the militant chic of calling themselves anarchists without the historical and philosophical baggage that accompanies such a claim, including the anti-racist egalitarian anarchist philosophy and the contributions of Jewish anarchists. Some scholars are skeptical that implementing national-anarchism would result in an expansion of freedom and describe it as an authoritarian anti-statism that would result in authoritarianism and oppression, only on a smaller scale.  By country  = China = Anarchists formed the first labor unions and the first large-scale peasant organizations in China. During the roughly two decades when anarchism was the dominant radical ideology in China (roughly 1900‚Äì1924), anarchists there were active in mass movements of all kinds, including the nationalist movement. A small group of anarchists, mostly those associated with the early Paris Group, a grouping of Chinese expatriates based in France, were deeply involved in the nationalist movement and many served as \\"movement elders\\" in the Kuomintang (KMT) right up until the defeat of the Nationalists by the Maoists. A minority of Chinese anarchists associated with the Paris Group also helped funnel large sums of money to Sun Yat-sen to help finance the Nationalist Revolution of 1911. After the Nationalist Revolution, anarchist involvement with the Kuomintang was relatively minor, not only because the majority of anarchists opposed nationalism on principle, but also because the KMT government was more than willing to level repression against anarchist organizations whenever and wherever they challenged state power. Still, a few prominent anarchists, notably Jing Meijiu and Zhang Ji, both affiliated with the Tokyo Group, were elected to positions within the KMT government and continued to call themselves anarchists while doing so. The response from the larger anarchist movement was decidedly mixed. They were roundly denounced by the Guangzhou group, but other groupings that favored an evolutionary approach to social change instead of immediate revolution such as the Pure Socialists were more sympathetic. The \\"Diligent Work and Frugal Study\\" program in France, a series of businesses and educational programs organized along anarchist lines that allowed Chinese students from working-class backgrounds to come to France and receive a European education that had previously been only available to a tiny wealthy elite, was one product of this collaboration of the anarchists with nationalists. The program received funding from both the Chinese and French governments as well as raising its own independent funds through a series of worker-owned anarchist businesses, including a tofu factory that catered to the needs of Chinese migrant workers in France. The program allowed poor and working-class Chinese students to receive a high- quality modern university education in France at a time when foreign education was almost exclusively limited to the children of wealthy elites, and educated thousands of Chinese workers and students, including many future Chinese Communist Party (CPC) leaders such as Deng Xiaoping. Following the success of the Bolsheviks in the Russian Revolution, anarchism went into decline in the Chinese labour movement. In 1924, the CPC allied itself with the nationalist KMT. Originally composed of many former anarchists, it soon attracted a mass base, becoming increasingly critical of anarchism. When the Kuomintang purged the CPC from its ranks in 1927, the small group of anarchists who had long participated in the KMT urged their younger comrades to join the movement and utilize it in the same way that the Stalinists had been using it as a vehicle to gain membership and influence. Partly because of the growing power of the right-wing within the KMT and the repression of workers movements advocated by that right-wing, the anarchists opted not to join the KMT en masse or even work within it. Instead, the result of this last collaboration was the creation of China's first Labor University. The Labor University was intended to be a domestic version of the Paris groups Diligent Work and Frugal Study educational program and sought to create a new generation of labor intellectuals who would finally overcome the gap between \\"those who work with their hands\\" and \\"those who work with their minds\\". The goal was to train working-class people with the skills they needed to self-organize and set up their own independent organizations and worker-owned businesses which would form the seed of a new anarchist society within the shell of the old in a dual power-based evolutionary strategy reminiscent of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. The university would only function for a very few years before the Nationalist government decided that the project was too subversive to allow it too continue and pulled funding. When the KMT initiated a second wave of political repression against the few remaining mass movements, anarchists left the organization en masse and were forced underground as hostilities between the KMT and the CPC, both of whom were hostile towards the anarchists, who are anti-authoritarians and libertarians, escalated. = Ireland = The armed struggle against British rule in Ireland, particularly up to and during the Irish War of Independence, is portrayed as a national liberation struggle within the Celtic anarchist milieu. Anarchists, including the platformist Workers Solidarity Movement (WSM), support a complete end to British involvement in Ireland, a stance traditionally associated with Irish republicanism, but they are also very critical of statist nationalism and the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in particular. Anarchists are extremely critical of the IRA as well as of the various loyalist paramilitaries because of their use of political violence and internal authoritarianism. From the anarchist view, British and Irish nationalism are both authoritarian, statist and seek to dominate and exploit the Irish nation to empower their competing sovereign states. Anarchism would instead create a political system without the nation state where communities are self-governing on the local level. The achievement of home rule, or political self-determination, is therefore a precondition for and a consequence of anarchism. At its root, the anarchist objection to Irish nationalism is that nationalists use reprehensible means to demand far too little. Still, anarchists seek to learn from and examine the liberatory aspects of the struggle for Irish independence and the WSM includes a demand for complete British withdrawal from Northern Ireland in its platform. In two articles published on Anarkismo.net, Andrew Flood of the WSM outlines what he argues was the betrayal of class struggle by the IRA during the war of independence and argues that the statism of traditional Irish nationalism forced it to place the interests of wealthy Irish nationalists who were financing the revolution ahead of the interests of the vast majority of Ireland's poor. The Irish Citizens Army, a workers militia which was led by James Connolly and based in the radical wing of the Irish Home Rule and Irish union movements, is held up as a better example of how the larger revolutionary movement could have and should have been organized.Flood, Andrew. \\"Insurrection in Ireland\\". Anarkismo.net. Retrieved 23 September 2020. The WSM has produced a number of articles and essays on the relationship between anarchism and Irish republicanism over the years. Their position is that anarchism and republicanism are incompatible and opposed to each other, but that anarchists can and should learn things from Ireland's long history of struggle. In their analysis, republicanism has always been split between rich people who want to rule directly and working class movements that demand social equality and community self-governance instead of simply trading foreign bosses for local ones. In \\"The Republican Tradition ‚Äì A Place to Build From?\\", the WSM wrote: > In Ireland in the 1790s we had a mass republican movement influenced by the > American and then the French revolutions.

According to this analysis, anarchism is the successor to left-wing nationalism, a working-class movement working to achieve the liberation that the republican movements that toppled the worlds monarchies in the last two centuries promised, albeit never delivered. According to the WSM, although the ideas of anarchism are fundamentally different from those of nationalism, it is still possible to learn from nationalist movements by studying the working- class elements of those movements that demanded more than the bourgeoisie leadership was willing or able to deliver.

A long-time advocate of Indian nationalism, Dayal developed a vision of anarchism based upon a return to the principles of ancient Aryan society.Puri 1983. Dayal was particularly influenced by Guy Aldred, who was jailed for printing The Indian Sociologist in 1907. An anarcho-communist, Aldred was careful to point out that this solidarity arose because he was an advocate of free speech and not because he felt that nationalism would help the working class in British India or elsewhere.Aldred 1948. = Spain = During the Spanish Civil War, Spanish anarchists and Basque nationalists fought together against the Francoist Nationalist side. The anarchist Felix Likiniano fought fascism even from the French Resistance. Along with Federico Krutwig, Likiniano tried to synthesize Basque nationalism and anarchism. In France, Likiniano befriended disgruntled members of the Euzko Gaztedi and created for them the symbol of the axe and the snake and the Bietan jarrai motto that they adopted for their new revolutionary armed organization ETA.Pascual, Jakue (27 October 2011). \\"Aizkora eta sugea\\". Anarkherria. Retrieved 20 September 2020.  Anarchism and anti-imperialism  = Black anarchism = Black anarchism opposes the existence of a state and subjugation and domination of people of color, favoring a non-hierarchical organization of society. Black anarchists seek to abolish the state alongside capitalism and white supremacy. Theorists include Ashanti Alston, Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin, Kuwasi Balagoon, many former members of the Black Panther Party and Martin Sostre. Black anarchism rejects the classical anarchist movement on racial issues. Black anarchists oppose the anti-racist conception, based on the universalism of the Age of Enlightenment which is proposed by the classical anarchist tradition, arguing that it is not adequate enough to struggle against racism and that it disguises real inequalities by proclaiming a de jure equality. Pedro Ribeiro has criticized the whole of the anarchist movement by declaring that \\"[i]t is a white, petty- bourgeois Anarchism that cannot relate to the people. As a Black person, I am not interested in your Anarchism. I am not interested in individualistic, self-serving, selfish liberation for you and your white friends. What I care about is the liberation of my people\\". Black anarchists are influenced by the civil rights movement and the Black Panther Party, seeking to forge their own movement that represents their own identity and tailored to their own unique situation. However, in contrast to black activism that was in the past based in leadership from hierarchical organizations, black anarchism rejects such methodology in favor of developing organically through communication and cooperation to bring about an economic and cultural revolution that does away with capitalism, racist domination and the state. In the @narchist Panther Zine, Alston wrote: > Panther anarchism is ready, willing and able to challenge old nationalist > and revolutionary notions that have been accepted as 'common-sense.' It also > challenges the bullshit in our lives and in the so-called movement that > holds us back from building a genuine movement based on the enjoyment of > life, diversity, practical self-determination and multi-faceted resistance > to the Babylonian Pigocracy. This Pigocracy is in our 'heads,' our > relationships as well as in the institutions that have a vested interest in > our eternal domination.Alston, Ashanti (October 1999). @narchist Panther > Zine. 1 (1). = Independence anarchism = Independence anarchism attempts to synthesise certain aspects of national liberation movements with an opposition to hierarchical institutions grounded in libertarian socialism. Where a certain nation or people exists with its own distinct language, culture and self- identity, independence anarchists concur with supporters of nationalism that such a nation is entitled to self-determination. While statist nationalists advocate the resolution of national questions by the formation of new states, independence anarchists advocate self-government without the need for a state and are committed to the key anarchist societal principles of federalisation, mutual aid and anarchist economics. Some supporters of the movement defend its position as a tactical one, arguing that secessionism and self-organisation is a particularly effective strategy with which to challenge state power. Independence anarchism frames national questions primarily in terms of equality, and the right of all peoples to cultural autonomy, linguistic rights, etc. Being grounded in such concepts, independence anarchism is strongly opposed to racism, xenophobia, national supremacism and isolationism of any kind, favouring instead internationalism and cooperation between peoples. Independence anarchists also stand opposed to homogenisation within cultures, holding diversity as a core principle. Those who identify as part of the tendency may also ground their position in a commitment to anti-racism (postcolonial anarchism), class struggle (anarcho-communism and anarcho- syndicalism), ecology (green anarchism), feminism (anarcha-feminism) and LGBT liberation (queer anarchism).AAVV. Anarquisme i alliberament nacional. . = Post-colonial anarchism = Post-colonial anarchism is a relatively new tendency within the larger anarchist movement. The name is taken from an essay by Roger White, one of the founders of Jailbreak Press and an activist in North American Anarchist People of Color (APOC) circles. Post-colonial anarchism is an attempt to bring together disparate aspects and tendencies within the existing anarchist movement and re-envision them in an explicitly anti-imperialist framework. Where traditional anarchism is a movement arising from the struggles of proletarians in industrialized western European nations and sees history from this perspective, post-colonial anarchism approaches the same principles of class struggle, mutual aid and opposition to social hierarchy as well as support for community-level self-determination, self- government and self-management from the perspective of colonized peoples throughout the world. In doing so, post-colonial anarchism does not seek to invalidate the contributions of the more established anarchist movement, but rather it seeks to add a unique and important perspective. The tendency is strongly influenced by anti-statist forms of left-wing nationalism, APOC and indigenism, among other sources.  References   Bibliography  * Aldred, Guy (1948). Rex v. Aldred.

It is the western terminus for the Colorado River Aqueduct that provides much of the water used by the cities and water districts of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. The reservoir is fenced and closed to all public access. The lake is near the Riverside community of Lake Hills, and is skirted by Cajalco Road on the south, El Sobrante Road on the north and east, and La Sierra Avenue on the west. La Sierra Avenue traverses the top of the west dike. The reservoir was constructed by building a large earthfill dam across the northern side of the basin. Two smaller dams, called dikes, were built during the 1961 expansion to increase the lake's capacity. History Originally named the Cajalco Reservoir, the reservoir is now named after W.B. Mathews, an attorney who was a key architect of the MWD and its business relationships with member water agencies. Construction on the reservoir began in 1933, at the same time the aqueduct was being built across the desert. The reservoir site had previously been occupied chiefly by carob orchards and tin mines. Lawrence Holmes, Sr., who owned 1,100 acres in the future reservoir basin, lost his property to eminent domain in a lengthy court battle. Kathleen Dever and Judy Whitson, Lake Mathews And Gavilan Hills, Arcadia Publishing, Charleston, 2007, pp.39-100 The dam across Cajalco Canyon and its intake structure were completed in 1939. The first water arrived from the Colorado River in February 1940, and water deliveries began in 1941. In 1961, the reservoir's capacity was nearly doubled to its current capacity of 182,000 acre-feet. In the mid-2000s, a large project was undertaken to rehabilitate the old outlet tower and to construct a new tower as an alternate. The MWD was concerned about the tower's susceptibility to earthquakes, and age had rendered many of the tower's massive valves unusable. To allow for construction without impacting the water supply, a cofferdam was constructed.MWD People Interactive Magazine, June 2002 Massive concrete tunnels were built to connect the new tower to the existing waterworks. Lake Mathews Ecological Reserve Lake Mathews from the air Lake Mathews is surrounded by approximately 4,000 acres of protected land. In 1982, this land was declared a state ecological reserve. In the early 1990s, an additional 9,000 acres was added to the reserve after the discovery of the endangered Stephen's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys stephensi) in the area. The area is now called the Lake Mathews Estelle Mountain Reserve.Riverside County Integrated Project page The Lake Mathews area is an important bird resting and feeding site, particularly in the winter months. In addition to a variety of ducks, double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus), western grebe (Aechmophorus occidentalis), eared grebe (Podiceps caspicus), golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), and bald eagles (Haliaeatus leucocephalus), are present during the winter.BioHere.com data page Effects on Santa Ana River flow Lake Mathews was constructed in a basin formerly traversed by Cajalco Creek; thus, any water flowing down the creek enters the reservoir. Cajalco Creek is a tributary of the Santa Ana River via Cajalco Canyon Creek into Temescal Creek. The original course of the creek, before 1933, can be seen on the US Dept. of the Interior's 1898 topographic map of the Elsinore Quadrangle. 1901 Elsinore Quadrangle, CA topographic Map, reprinted in 1941. from lib.utexas.edu, accessed 6/6/2015 In 2003, the California State Water Resources Control Board found the MWD's interruption of Cajalco Creek water to be in violation of state water code. An out-of-court settlement was reached where MWD would monitor the quantity of water entering Lake Mathews from the creek and release 1.3 times that amount, minus dam seepage, into the Santa Ana River. In addition, MWD was ordered to contribute $50,000 to aid in the removal of non- native arundo grass (Arundo donax) from the Santa Ana River course.CA State Water Resources Control Board, Order 2003-0019-EXEC Controversy over recreational use Since its dedication in 1940, the reservoir has been fenced off and closed to public access, supposedly to preserve water quality. The MWD has always been concerned about water quality and prohibits body contact sports like swimming in its other nearby reservoirs that are open for recreation, Lake Skinner and Diamond Valley Lake. Mathews is of greatest importance as its outlet feeds directly into pipelines that connect to member water agencies serving 8.4 million people. During its existence, a number of attempts have been made to gain access to the lake for various purposes, but none have been granted. One of the most interesting was a 1952 request for a movie shoot at the lake. The scene from the 1953 movie Fair Wind to Java would have featured, among other things, a smoke-belching volcano constructed on one of the lake's islands.MWD Document Archives After their idea was rejected by the MWD Board, the movie's producers reportedly constructed a lagoon and volcano on a studio backlot.TCM notes page on Fair Wind to Java In 1960, the Riverside County Board of Supervisors mounted an unsuccessful campaign to open the lake for recreational purposes. The board generated a resolution citing a \\"pressing and definite need\\" for recreational facilities in Southern California.MWD Document Archives California Assemblyman Kevin Jeffries, on February 14, 2012, introduced legislation, AB 1686, which would have opened the lake for limited recreation similar to that available at other MWD reservoirs or, at the very least, have allowed for low-impact hiking in the Ecological Reserve. However, Jeffries withdrew the bill on March 20, 2012 after research determined that \\"virtually bulletproof\\" agreements prohibiting public access exist between the MWD and other entities interested in maintaining the status quo, and going forward with the bill would have likely resulted in prolonged and expensive legal battles.Residents' Association of Greater Lake Mathews See also * List of dams and reservoirs in California * List of lakes in California References Mathews Lake Category:Temescal Mountains Category:Dams in California Category:United States local public utility dams Category:Infrastructure completed in 1938 Category:1938 establishments in California Mathews Lake Mathews ","title":"Lake Mathews"},{"id":"2382395","text":"A tree diagram of English functions In linguistics, grammatical relations (also called grammatical functions, grammatical roles, or syntactic functions) are functional relationships between constituents in a clause. The standard examples of grammatical functions from traditional grammar are subject, direct object, and indirect object. In recent times, the syntactic functions (more generally referred to as grammatical relations), typified by the traditional categories of subject and object, have assumed an important role in linguistic theorizing, within a variety of approaches ranging from generative grammar to functional and cognitive theories. Many modern theories of grammar are likely to acknowledge numerous further types of grammatical relations (e.g. complement, specifier, predicative, etc.). The role of grammatical relations in theories of grammar is greatest in dependency grammars, which tend to posit dozens of distinct grammatical relations. Every head-dependent dependency bears a grammatical function. Grammatical categories are assigned to the words and phrases that have the relations. This includes traditional parts of speech like nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc., and features like number and tense. In traditional grammar The grammatical relations are exemplified in traditional grammar by the notions of subject, direct object, and indirect object: ::Fred gave Susan the book. The subject Fred performs or is the source of the action. The direct object the book is acted upon by the subject, and the indirect object Susan receives the direct object or otherwise benefits from the action. Traditional grammars often begin with these rather vague notions of the grammatical functions. When one begins to examine the distinctions more closely, it quickly becomes clear that these basic definitions do not provide much more than a loose orientation point. What is indisputable about the grammatical relations is that they are relational. That is, subject and object can exist as such only by virtue of the context in which they appear. A noun such as Fred or a noun phrase such as the book cannot qualify as subject and direct object, respectively, unless they appear in an environment, e.g. a clause, where they are related to each other and/or to an action or state. In this regard, the main verb in a clause is responsible for assigning grammatical relations to the clause \\"participants\\". Defining the grammatical relations Most grammarians and students of language intuitively know in most cases what the subject and object in a given clause are. But when one attempts to produce theoretically satisfying definitions of these notions, the results are usually less than clear and therefore controversial.Napoli (199326, 46ff., 91ff.) provides an insightful discussion of notions such as 'subject' and 'direct object'. The contradictory impulses have resulted in a situation where most theories of grammar acknowledge the grammatical relations and rely on them heavily for describing phenomena of grammar but at the same time, avoid providing concrete definitions of them. Nevertheless, various principles can be acknowledged that attempts to define the grammatical relations are based on. =Thematic criteria= The thematic relations (also known as thematic roles, and semantic roles, e.g. agent, patient, theme, goal) can provide semantic orientation for defining the grammatical relations. There is a tendency for subjects to be agents and objects to be patients or themes. However, the thematic relations cannot be substituted for the grammatical relations, nor vice versa. This point is evident with the active-passive diathesis and ergative verbs: ::Marge has fixed the coffee table. ::The coffee table has been fixed (by Marge). ::The torpedo sank the ship. ::The ship sank. Marge is the agent in the first pair of sentences because she initiates and carries out the action of fixing, and the coffee table is the patient in both because it is acted upon in both sentences. In contrast, the subject and direct object are not consistent across the two sentences. The subject is the agent Marge in the first sentence and the patient The coffee table in the second sentence. The direct object is the patient the coffee table in the first sentence, and there is no direct object in the second sentence. The situation is similar with the ergative verb sunk/sink in the second pair of sentences. The noun phrase the ship is the theme in both sentences, although it is the object in the first of the two and the subject in the second. The grammatical relations belong to the level of surface syntax, whereas the thematic relations reside on a deeper semantic level. If, however, the correspondences across these levels are acknowledged, then the thematic relations can be seen as providing prototypical thematic traits for defining the grammatical relations. =Configurational criteria= Another prominent means used to define the syntactic relations is in terms of the syntactic configuration. The subject is defined as the verb argument that appears outside of the canonical finite verb phrase, whereas the object is taken to be the verb argument that appears inside the verb phrase.See for instance Chomsky (1965), Bach (1974:39), Cowper (1992:40), Culicover (1997:167f.), Carnie (2007:118‚Äì120). This approach takes the configuration as primitive, whereby the grammatical relations are then derived from the configuration. This \\"configurational\\" understanding of the grammatical relations is associated with Chomskyan phrase structure grammars (Transformational grammar, Government and Binding and Minimalism). The configurational approach is limited in what it can accomplish. It works best for the subject and object arguments. For other clause participants (e.g. attributes and modifiers of various sorts, prepositional arguments, etc.), it is less insightful, since it is often not clear how one might define these additional syntactic functions in terms of the configuration. Furthermore, even concerning the subject and object, it can run into difficulties, e.g. ::There were two lizards in the drawer. The configurational approach has difficulty with such cases. The plural verb were agrees with the post-verb noun phrase two lizards, which suggests that two lizards is the subject. But since two lizards follows the verb, one might view it as being located inside the verb phrase, which means it should count as the object. This second observation suggests that the expletive there should be granted subject status. =Morphological criteria= Many efforts to define the grammatical relations emphasize the role inflectional morphology. In English, the subject can or must agree with the finite verb in person and number, and in languages that have morphological case, the subject and object (and other verb arguments) are identified in terms of the case markers that they bear (e.g. nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, ergative, absolutive, etc.). Inflectional morphology may be a more reliable means for defining the grammatical relations than the configuration, but its utility can be very limited in many cases. For instance, inflectional morphology is not going to help in languages that lack inflectional morphology almost entirely such as Mandarin, and even with English, inflectional morphology does not help much, since English largely lacks morphological case. =Prototypical traits= The difficulties facing attempts to define the grammatical relations in terms of thematic or configurational or morphological criteria can be overcome by an approach that posits prototypical traits. The prototypical subject has a cluster of thematic, configurational, and/or morphological traits, and the same is true of the prototypical object and other verb arguments. Across languages and across constructions within a language, there can be many cases where a given subject argument may not be a prototypical subject, but it has enough subject-like traits to be granted subject status. Similarly, a given object argument may not be prototypical in one way or another, but if it has enough object-like traits, then it can nevertheless receive the status of object. This third strategy is tacitly preferred by most work in theoretical syntax. All those theories of syntax that avoid providing concrete definitions of the grammatical relations but yet reference them often are (perhaps unknowingly) pursuing an approach in terms of prototypical traits. Heads and dependents In dependency grammar (DG) theories of syntax,The most comprehensive source on DG is √Ågel et al. (2003/6). every head-dependent dependency bears a syntactic function.See Mel‚Äôƒçuk (1988:22, 69). The result is that an inventory consisting of dozens of distinct syntactic functions is needed for each language. For example, a determiner- noun dependency might be assumed to bear the DET (determiner) function, and an adjective-noun dependency is assumed to bear the ATTR (attribute) function. These functions are often produced as labels on the dependencies themselves in the syntactic tree, e.g. ::Grammatical relations: Labeled DG tree The tree contains the following syntactic functions: ATTR (attribute), CCOMP (clause complement), DET (determiner), MOD (modifier), OBJ (object), SUBJ (subject), and VCOMP (verb complement). The actual inventories of syntactic functions will differ from the one suggested here in the number and types of functions that are assumed. In this regard, this tree is merely intended to be illustrative of the importance that the syntactic functions can take on in some theories of syntax and grammar.

It owns and operates a manufacturing and assembly facility for the parent company. The TMMTX assembly lines currently produce the Tundra full-size pickup truck and the Tacoma mid-size pickup truck. __TOC__ History In 2002, Toyota began scouting locations in Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas for a new assembly plant to build the second generation Tundra pickup. After long deliberations including the offer of $227 million in subsidies, a site on the far south side of San Antonio was selected as the location for the new assembly plant. Toyota broke ground at the new plant site on 17 October 2003. During construction, the project evolved from a simple assembly plant into an automotive production site including several on-site suppliers which shipped directly to the factory. In addition, Toyota announced that production capacity, originally planned for 150,000 units per year, would be expanded to 200,000 units. This increase brought Toyota's investment in the plant to $1.2 billion. Following four years of construction, the first new Tundra pickups rolled off the line in November 2006 during a grand-opening celebration which drew executives, employees and dealers of Toyota from around the country. One Toyota executive went so far as to call the launch of the second-generation Tundra the 'single biggest and most important launch in Toyota's 50-year U.S. history.' Production Second-generation Tundra production was initially split between TMMTX in San Antonio and Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indiana near Princeton, Indiana (which had produced the first generation Tundra). The Base Cab (2 door) and Double Cab (2 full doors and 2 small doors) pickups were produced in San Antonio, with additional Double Cab Tundras and all CrewMax pickups produced in Princeton. The Tundra was initially hailed as a revolutionary step forward for Toyota Trucks, winning the Motor Trend Truck of the Year award in 2008; however the vehicle's reputation was marred by a recall of 15,000 units due to a mistake made by a supplier of a rear propeller shaft. This initial problem aside, the 2007 model year Tundra was a success with sales in 2007 almost selling out annual production of 200,000 units. The surge in oil prices driven by the commodity boom in 2008 put significant pressure on sales of the truck, and Toyota sold just under 140,000 Tundras the following year. As the economic downturn put pressure on the US auto market, combined with the high fuel prices of the mid-2008, vehicle sales tumbled in late 2008 to the extent that Toyota shut down production at TMMTX for a three- month period to reduce inventory of the Tundra pickup. In late 2008, Toyota announced that all Tundra production would be moved to TMMTX (ending Tundra production in Princeton, Indiana). This announcement effectively preserved the jobs of the 1,850 workers at TMMTX that were threatened by the ongoing financial crisis. In September 2009, Toyota announced it would be terminating Corolla and Tacoma production at the NUMMI assembly plant, which had been operated as a joint venture with General Motors, who withdrew from the partnership as it entered bankruptcy. This change ultimately proved to benefit TMMTX, as Tacoma production relocated to San Antonio and Toyota Motor Manufacturing de Baja California in Mexico. TMMTX added 1,000 workers to support the production of the Tacoma. This change effectively moved all of Toyota's US pickup production to TMMTX for the foreseeable future. Between 2020 and 2021, Toyota plans to wind down production of the Tacoma at TMMTX as production winds up at its new Mexico plant, Toyota Motor Manufacturing de Guanajuato. In 2022, TMMTX will begin building the Toyota Sequoia large SUV, which is built on the same frame as the Tundra.

In 1995 he was wrongfully convicted of the murder of Australian Federal Police Assistant Commissioner Colin Winchester and was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. A 2014 judicial inquiry recommended the sentence be quashed and he should be pardoned. On 22 August of the same year, the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory quashed the conviction, released Eastman from prison, and ordered a retrial. Eastman sought leave to the High Court to appeal against the decision for a retrial. His appeal was unsuccessful, and a retrial commenced on 18 June 2018. On 22 November 2018, the jury in the retrial found Eastman not guilty of murder. Eastman, who had served 19 years in custody, was awarded A$7 million in compensation in October 2019. Early life and background Eastman's father, Allan Eastman who died in 1987, worked at the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and had several overseas postings in ambassadorial roles. As a child, Eastman frequently moved house due to his father's overseas postings. Eastman has one younger sister and two older twin sisters. Eastman was very successful at Canberra Grammar School where he was dux, and he went to the University of Sydney at the age of 16. When he was 21 he started seeing a psychiatrist because he was \\"feeling lonely and miserable and not getting on with people\\". In 1986, Eastman's mother requested a restraining order on Eastman after he threatened her life while trying to break down her front door. Career Eastman was a Treasury official until 1977 when he retired on health grounds. He later applied for a post at the Australian Bureau of Statistics but was rejected with one reason being given that he had written letters to the press regarding economic and business matters which might be seen to prejudice the Bureau's reputation. Although the Ombudsman was not allowed to investigate internal public service matters, he agreed to investigate a case brought by Eastman because he was a member of the public at the time. Subsequently, the Ombudsman concluded there had not been discrimination against Eastman. Eastman had sought, on several fronts and over a sustained period, to be reinstated to the public service. On 21 December 1988 approval to his reinstatement was granted. According to media reports from Eastman's criminal trial, Eastman became involved in a dispute with a neighbour on 17 December 1987; and Eastman was charged with assault. He led a determined campaign to convince police that he had been wrongly charged and that it was his neighbour who had been the instigator. On 16 December 1988 Eastman met with Colin Winchester, the Chief Police Officer of ACT Policing, in an attempt to review the assault charge. The meeting was brokered by Neil Brown, the shadow attorney-general, who also met with Peter McAulay, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. On 21 December 1988 Winchester advised Eastman that he would need to face the assault charges in court; and an appearance date was set for 12 January 1989. Eastman was advised by letter that the AFP would not interfere with the conviction. The letter arrived at Eastman's flat on the morning of 10 January 1989. It was alleged that Eastman had made threats against Winchester's life in the period preceding Winchester's murder. Death of Winchester On 10 January 1989, at about 9:15 pm, Colin Winchester was shot twice in the head with a Ruger 10/22 .22-calibre semi-automatic rifle fitted with a silencer. Winchester was murdered as he parked his police vehicle near his house in Deakin, Canberra. Winchester parked in his neighbour's driveway; his neighbour was an elderly woman who felt safer with a car parked in her driveway. Winchester is Australia's most senior police officer to have been murdered. The day following Winchester's murder, police interviewed Eastman as a murder suspect. Legal proceedings After two years of investigations that included an inquest by the ACT Chief Coroner, Eastman was summonsed to appear before the Coroner, but failed to do so. A warrant for Eastman's arrest was issued on 23 December 1992 and on the same day he was arrested and charged with the murder of Winchester. Eastman was subsequently committed to a trial. =Murder trial= During the 85-day trial that commenced in 1995, Eastman repeatedly sacked his legal team and eventually chose to represent himself. Eastman also abused the judge during his trial, and during later legal proceedings and appeals. A report written for Eastman's murder trial stated that he previously had \\"six charges of threatening to kill, 128 charges of making harassing or menacing phone calls, 11 charges of assault and one of assault occasioning actual bodily harm\\". Also \\"He has been charged with assaulting police on three occasions.\\" During the trial the Crown presented evidence that allegedly linked Eastman to the firearm used, to traces of ammunition and propellant from the silencer, and reported sightings of Eastman near the murder scene and at gun shops in Queanbeyan. Eastman was legally bugged for three and a half years; yet only a very small proportion of the recorded material was used as evidence in his trial. In evaluating the case, Flinders University academic, David Hamer, reported that: After a lengthy and difficult trial, on 3 November 1995 a jury returned a verdict of guilty against Eastman and he was convicted for murder of Winchester. Eastman was sentenced to life imprisonment. =Subsequent appeals and inquiries= Subsequent to his conviction, Eastman was litigious and repeatedly appealed against his conviction. He lost an appeal in the Federal Court in 1999; and a subsequent appeal to the High Court in 2000. In 2000 and 2001, while detained in the Goulburn Correctional Centre, Eastman successfully lobbied for and was granted a judicial review of his conviction. The aim of the review was to determine if Eastman had sufficient mental capacity in order to plead in the trial for the murder of Winchester. After two years of hearings, Miles J determined that Eastman had sufficient capacity and the conviction for murder was unchanged. Eastman tried again in 2005 on several grounds, including his fitness to stand trial, unreliable forensic evidence taken from the scene, and other doubts as to his guilt. His application was dismissed. In 2008 proceedings before the Full Bench of the Federal Court, Eastman, appearing without legal representation, sought that his initial appeal be allowed, his conviction quashed and a retrial in the Supreme Court. The matter was dismissed. A new inquiry relating to his conviction was announced in August 2012 and headed by Acting Justice Brian Martin, who reported to the Supreme Court that: The Australian Federal Police unsuccessfully sought that parts of the report be withheld. On 22 August 2014 the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory quashed the conviction, released Eastman from prison, and ordered a retrial in spite of the recommendation from the report by Martin J that \\"a retrial is neither feasible, nor fair.\\" Eastman appealed the decision for a retrial to the ACT Court of Appeal and then to the High Court. Both appeals were dismissed and in 2017 it was ordered that a retrial should be held. The retrial commenced in Canberra on 18 June 2018. =Retrial and compensation= On 22 November 2018, Eastman was found not guilty by a jury in the ACT Supreme Court. Eastman's lawyer Angus Webb also read out a statement, saying a miscarriage of justice had left Eastman spending 19 years in custody. Referring to today's verdict he said, \\"Justice has been done.\\" Terry O'Donnell, a former public defender who previously acted for Eastman said outside his court that he had been watching the legal saga \\"with some horror,\\" but was now relieved for Eastman. \\"The first trial was an absolute disgrace, it was a shambles, it was a miscarriage ‚Äì the forensic evidence was almost certainly fabricated in some respects.\\" The cost of the retrial, including lead-up proceedings, was estimated to exceed A$30 million. Eastman, who had served 19 years in custody, lodged a civil claim against the ACT Government, seeking compensation for wrongful imprisonment. Eastman rejected an ex-gratia offer of compensation of more than A$3 million, instead asking for at least A$18 million. On 14 October 2019, in the ACT Supreme Court, Justice Michael Elkaim awarded Eastman A$7.02 million in compensation under the Human Rights Act and ordered the ACT Government to pay Eastman's costs. =Other legal matters= Whilst in custody, in 2001 Eastman was evicted from his public housing apartment that he had not occupied for ten years. Eastman appealed the eviction order to the ACT Supreme Court on the basis that he had not been given enough notice to effectively defend his position. The Court ruled in Eastman's favour and determined that he was denied natural justice. The ACT Tenancy Tribunal was directed to review the case. On 27 May 2009 Eastman was transferred from a New South Wales prison to the Alexander Maconochie Centre, a newly opened prison located in the ACT, to see out his sentence. During his period in New South Wales prisons he lodged a large number of complaints alleging ill-treatment by guards and was frequently moved between jails.

They released one single and three EPs on the Mannequin record label, formed by Paul Abrahams, manager of the new romantic group Spoons (band). Their first single, \\"Life In Shadow\\" / \\"Maze of Ways\\" was the second release on Burlington-based Mannequin, following on the Spoons debut. It had a rough and ready quality with a one-two punk beat that sounded a little retro even in 1980. In 1981 they issued a five-track EP, Reason that established the sound they became known for, a moodier post-Joy Division groove that fit with other locals like Sheep Look Up and Breeding Ground. Brett Wickens was by now working for Peter Saville Associates in England, and designed an angular modernist cover in the mold of early New Order releases. This combination of compelling music, improved production and visual design garnered the band critical acclaim. Mike Rullman (vocals), Jean-Claude Chambers (guitars), Alan Murrell (bass) and Jon Davies (drums) found themselves opening for visiting bands including A Teardrop Explodes, The Stranglers and Gang of Four. The song \\"Animalistic\\" topped the dance-club charts in Toronto in 1981, and was a live favourite. Kinetic Ideals toured Canada and the US before heading to London, England, for a series of showcase gigs. While there, Jon Davies was struck by an automobile just after sound-check for a gig at the 101 Club. He did not return to Canada with the band. In 1982 \\"Angular Sky\\" / \\"Fade Away\\" was released as a 12\\" but the sprawling disjointed songs did little to build an audience. A session steel drum player replaced the keyboard parts played live by Bruce PM. Jon Davies left the band for good to join Breeding Ground and was replaced by a drum machine. Their final release was the EP A Personal View in 1983. Pressed on white vinyl this included \\"Me And The Sky\\", \\"Together\\" and \\"In A Second\\", songs that were more contemplative and less angry than earlier exercises in tension. The band's use of the Oberheim DMX drum machine is distinctive. This recording was produced by Brett Wickens and engineered by Greg Roberts at Grant Avenue Studios, home of Daniel Lanois and various Brian Eno recordings. Patrick Duffy was recruited as a new drummer, but recordings of this lineup were not released until 2013. Kinetic Ideals disbanded in 1986 after the vocalist Mikal Rulman left the band.

The idea of the plot was suggested to Trollope by his brother Thomas.Rendell, Ruth. \\"Introduction\\", Doctor Thorne, London: Penguin Books, 1991, p. viii The novel is mainly concerned with the difficulties experienced by Mary Thorne, the niece of Doctor Thomas Thorne (a member of a junior branch of the family of Mr Wilfred Thorne, who appeared in Barchester Towers), in the course of her romance with Frank Gresham, the only son of the local squire. However, Trollope, as the omniscient narrator, assures the reader at the beginning that the hero is really the doctor. The themes of the book include the social shame and rejection caused by illegitimacy, the nefarious effects of the demon drink, and the difficulties of romantic attachments outside one's social class. The novel also gives a vivid picture of electioneering and all the barely legal shenanigans that accompany it. Most of the action takes place in a village of Barsetshire and a country house not far off. Plot summary When their father dies, Doctor Thomas Thorne and his younger brother Henry are left to fend for themselves. Thomas begins to establish a medical practice. Henry seduces Mary Scatcherd, the sister of stonemason Roger Scatcherd. When Roger finds out that Mary has become pregnant, he kills Henry in a fight. While her brother is in prison for the death, Mary gives birth to a girl. A former suitor offers to marry Mary and emigrate to America to start a new life, but not if she keeps the baby. Doctor Thorne persuades Mary to accept the offer, promising to raise his niece. He names her Mary Thorne, but, wishing neither to have her illegitimacy made public nor to have her associate with the uncouth Roger Scatcherd, he keeps her parentage secret. Mary Scatcherd tells her brother that the baby has died. After his release from prison, Scatcherd rises quickly in the world, becoming extremely rich. When he completes a seemingly impossible important project on time, he is made a baronet for his efforts. Throughout his career, he entrusts his financial affairs to Doctor Thorne. When Thorne becomes the family doctor to the Greshams, he persuades Scatcherd to lend increasing sums to the head of the family, the local squire. Eventually, much of the Gresham estate is put up as collateral. Meanwhile, Mary Thorne grows up with the Gresham children and becomes a great favourite with the whole family. As young adults, Mary and Frank Gresham ‚Äî the only son and heir of the squire of Greshamsbury ‚Äî fall in love. However, his parents want him to marry wealth, to rescue them from the financial distress resulting from the squire's expensive and fruitless campaigns for a seat in Parliament. As Mary is penniless and of lower birth, such a marriage is inconceivable to his mother and to the de Courcys, the Greshams' aristocratic relatives. They wish Frank to marry the 30-year-old, eccentric heiress Martha Dunstable instead. Frank reluctantly visits Courcy Castle in order to meet Miss Dunstable, and they become friends. He foolishly and playfully proposes but she demurs, knowing that he does not love her. Sir Roger Scatcherd is a chronic drunkard and Doctor Thorne tries in vain to get him to curtail his drinking. In his will, Scatcherd stipulates that the bulk of his estate go to his only son, the dissolute Louis Philippe. However, he leaves Doctor Thorne in control of the inheritance until Louis Philippe reaches the age of 25. Should Louis die before then, Scatcherd stipulates that the estate go to his sister Mary's eldest child. Thorne, knowing that Scatcherd is thinking of the children Mary had in America, is forced to divulge Mary's history to Scatcherd, but Scatcherd leaves the will unchanged. Roger Scatcherd eventually dies of drink. The son proves just as much an alcoholic as the father, and his weaker constitution quickly brings him to the same end before he reaches the age of 25. After consulting with lawyers, Doctor Thorne confirms that his niece Mary is the heiress -- now richer than even Miss Dunstable. Unaware of these developments, the still resolute Frank finally persuades his doting father to consent to his marriage to Mary. When all is revealed, the rest of his relatives heartily congratulate him. Characters =The Thornes= *Dr Thomas Thorne, the uncle of Mary Thorne, who works as a doctor and apothecary.

It is set to a text by the Russian poet Konstantin Balmont and published in 1913 by P. Jurgenson. The original Russian title literally means \\"Star-face\\" or \\"The Star-Faced One\\". The work is more commonly known by the French title as translated by Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi. The work is very rarely performed, primarily because it is written for an unusually large orchestra ‚Äî quadruple woodwind, eight horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, bass drum, tam-tam (the entire percussion section only plays in one measure), two harps, celesta, and heavily divided strings‚Äîplus six-part men's chorus ‚Äî and because it lasts barely five minutes and encompasses just 54 measures. Claude Debussy, to whom the work is dedicated, praised the work in a 1913 letter to the composer; though describing it as \\"extraordinary\\", he doubted that it would soon find an audience, given its complexities and its short duration.Los Angeles Philharmonic: The King of the Stars , accessed March 29, 2011 Le roi des √©toiles was not performed in public until 1939.

The famous descent of the snake. March 2009 The Classic Maya vision serpent, as depicted at Yaxchilan. Kukulkan (\\"Plumed Serpent\\", \\"Feathered Serpent\\") is the name of a Mesoamerican serpent deity. Prior to the Spanish Conquest of the Yucat√°n, Kukulkan was worshipped by the Yucatec Maya people of the Yucat√°n Peninsula, in what is now Mexico. The depiction of the Feathered Serpent is present in other cultures of Mesoamerica. Kukulkan is closely related to the deity Q ºuq ºumatz of the K ºiche º people and to Quetzalcoatl of Aztec mythology.Read & Gonzalez 2000, pp. 180-2. Little is known of the mythology of this Pre- Columbian era deity.Read & Gonzalez 2000, p. 201. Although heavily Mexicanised, Kukulkan has his origins among the Maya of the Classic Period, when he was known as Waxaklahun Ubah Kan (), the War Serpent, and he has been identified as the Postclassic version of the Vision Serpent of Classic Maya art.Freidel et al 1993, pp. 289, 325, 441n26. The cult of Kukulkan/Quetzalcoatl was the first Mesoamerican religion to transcend the old Classic Period linguistic and ethnic divisions.Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp 582-3. This cult facilitated communication and peaceful trade among peoples of many different social and ethnic backgrounds. Although the cult was originally centred on the ancient city of Chichen Itza in the modern Mexican state of Yucat√°n, it spread as far as the Guatemalan Highlands.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 619. In Yucat√°n, references to the deity Kukulkan are confused by references to a named individual who bore the name of the god. Because of this, the distinction between the two has become blurred.Miller & Taube 1993, p. 142. This individual appears to have been a ruler or priest at Chichen Itza who first appeared around the 10th century.Read & Gonz√°lez 2000, p. 201. Although Kukulkan was mentioned as a historical person by Maya writers of the 16th century, the earlier 9th-century texts at Chichen Itza never identified him as human and artistic representations depicted him as a Vision Serpent entwined around the figures of nobles.Freidel et al 1993, p. 325. At Chichen Itza, Kukulkan is also depicted presiding over sacrifice scenes.Freidel et al 1993, p. 478n60. Sizeable temples to Kukulkan are found at archaeological sites throughout the north of the Yucat√°n Peninsula, such as Chichen Itza, Uxmal and Mayapan. Etymology In the Yucatec Maya language, the name is spelt K ºuk ºulkan () and in Tzotzil it is K ºuk ºul-chon ().Freidel et al 1993, p. 289. The Yucatec form of the name is formed from the word kuk \\"feather\\" with the adjectival suffix -ul, giving kukul \\"feathered\\",Yucatec-English Dictionary at FAMSI combined with kan \\"snake\\" (Tzotzil chon),Yucatec-English Dictionary at FAMSI giving a literal meaning of \\"feathered snake\\". Kukulkan and the Itza Kukulkan was a deity closely associated with the Itza state in the northern Yucat√°n Peninsula, where the cult formed the core of the state religion. Although the cult of Kukulkan had its origins in earlier Maya traditions, the Itza worship of Kukulkan was heavily influenced by the Quetzalcoatl cult of central Mexico. This influence probably arrived via Put√∫n Maya merchants from the Gulf Coast of Mexico. These Chontal merchants probably actively promoted the feathered serpent cult throughout Mesoamerica. Kukulkan headed a pantheon of deities of mixed Maya and non-Maya provenance, used to promote the Itza political and commercial agenda. It also eased the passage of Itza merchants into central Mexico and other non-Maya areas, promoting the Itza economy. At Chichen Itza, Kukulkan ceased to be the Vision Serpent that served as a messenger between the king and the gods and came instead to symbolise the divinity of the state.Schele & Freidel 1990, pp. 394-5. Ballcourt marker from the Postclassic site of Mixco Viejo in Guatemala. This sculpture depicts Kukulkan, jaws agape, with the head of a human warrior emerging from his maw. El Castillo, Chichen Itza served as a temple to Kukulkan. During the spring and fall equinoxes the shadow cast by the angle of the sun and edges of the nine steps of the pyramid combined with the northern stairway and the stone serpent head carvings create the illusion of a massive serpent descending the pyramid. After the fall of Chichen Itza, the nearby Postclassic city of Mayapan became the centre of the revived Kukulkan cult, with temples decorated with feathered serpent columns.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 598. At the time of the Spanish colonization, the high priest of Kukulkan was the family patriarch of the Xiu faction and was one of the two most powerful men in the city.Schele & Freidel 1990, pp. 361-2. The cult of Kukulkan spread as far as the Guatemalan Highlands, where Postclassic feathered serpent sculptures are found with open mouths from which protrude the heads of human warriors. Modern folklore Stories are still told about Kukulkan among the modern Yucatec Maya.Read & Gonz√°lez 2000, p. 202. In one tale, Kukulkan is a boy who was born as a snake. As he grew older it became obvious that he was the plumed serpent and his sister cared for him in a cave. He grew to such a size that his sister was unable to continue feeding him, so he flew out of his cave and into the sea, causing an earthquake. To let his sister know that he is still alive, Kukulkan causes earth tremors every year in July. A modern collection of folklore from Yucat√°n tells how Kukulkan was a winged serpent that flew to the sun and tried to speak to it but the sun, in its pride, burnt his tongue. The same source relates how Kukulkan always travels ahead of the Yucatec Maya rain god Chaac, helping to predict the rains as his tail moves the winds and sweeps the earth clean.G√≥mez 1995, p. 57. Among the Lacandon Maya of Chiapas, Kukulkan is an evil, monstrous snake that is the pet of the sun god. Notes References   See also *Kukulcania, a genus of crevice weavers named in its honor.

It is one of Gogol's most demonic of tales, hinting at some of his earlier works such as \\"St. John's Eve\\" and \\"Viy\\". Plot summary \\"The Portrait\\" is the story of a young and penniless artist, Andrey Petrovich Chartkov, who stumbles upon a terrifyingly lifelike portrait in an art shop and is compelled to buy it. The painting is magical and offers him a dilemma ‚Äî to struggle to make his own way in the world on the basis of his own talents or to accept the assistance of the magic painting to guaranteed riches and fame.

Trans. Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky. New York: Vintage Books,1998. 340-393. Print. he comes to realize that he has made the wrong choice. Eventually, he falls ill and dies from a fever. = Part I = The first part of the story takes place in nineteenth-century Saint Petersburg, Russia and follows a penniless yet talented young artist, Andrey Petrovich Chartkov. One day, Chartkov stumbles upon an old art shop, where he discovers a strikingly lifelike portrait of an old man whose eyes ‚Äústared even out of the portrait itself, as if destroying its harmony by their strange aliveness.‚Äù On an inexplicable impulse, Chartkov uses the last of his money to buy the portrait, which the art shop's dealer seems glad to be rid of. Chartkov returns to his shabby apartment and hangs up the painting, but is so haunted by the old man's stare he covers it with a bed sheet before going to bed. That night, Chartkov dreams the old man in the portrait comes alive and steps out of his frame with a sack of money. Twice Chartkov wakes up and realizes he is still dreaming, but on the third time he wakes for real and realizes he imagined both the portrait's movement and its money. However, ‚Äúit seemed to him that amidst the dream there had been some terrible fragment of reality.‚Äù Shortly thereafter, Chartkov's landlord arrives with a police inspector, demanding the rent. Chartkov is at a loss for what to do until the clumsy inspector accidentally cracks open the portrait's frame, revealing a pouch filled with one thousand gold sovereigns. Dumbfounded, Chartkov pays what he owes and begins making grand plans for the projects he can complete with his newfound wealth, recalling the encouraging words of his old mentor to ‚Äúponder over every work‚Äù and nurse his talent, while ignoring the superficial, ‚Äúfashionable‚Äù styles of the times. However, Chartkov's plans quickly go up in smoke, and instead he uses his riches on lavish items and an ad in the papers. He soon uses his new apartment on Nevsky Prospect to host the customers brought in by the ad. At first, Chartkov attempts to paint his subjects in his own style, as his mentor had advised, but he soon falls into more ‚Äúfashionable‚Äù styles in order to keep his customers happy. Though his ‚Äúdoorbell was constantly ringing,‚Äù his art becomes choked, and he resorts to ‚Äúthe general color scheme that is given by rote.‚Äù His reputation spreads and he is showered with countless compliments and immense wealth, but as the narrator remarks: ‚Äúfame cannot give pleasure to one who did not merit it but stole it.‚Äù Many years pass, and Chartkov achieves such a high reputation he is asked by the Academy of Arts to examine the work of another prominent artist, one who devoted his life to studying art in Italy. When Chartkov arrives at the gallery, he is struck by the painting, which he describes as ‚Äúpure, immaculate, beautiful as a bride.‚Äù In this artist's work Chartkov realizes what he missed out on and is so struck he bursts into tears and flees the gallery. At home in his studio, Chartkov attempts to revive the old talent he once had but inevitably fails, and in a fit of anger rids himself of the portrait of the old man and begins buying up ‚Äúall the best that art produced‚Äù and bringing it home to tear it to shreds. His madness eventually manifests itself into a physical illness, and Chartkov dies, haunted to the end by memories of the horrible portrait. = Part II = The second half of ‚ÄúThe Portrait‚Äù opens several years after the events of Part I, at an art auction is held at an old nobleman's house at which the sinister portrait is put up for sale. In the midst of the bids, a young man appears who claims he has ‚Äúperhaps more right to this portrait than anyone else.‚Äù He promptly begins telling the audience his story. His father was an artist who worked in Kolomna, a tired, ‚Äúashen‚Äù part of St. Petersburg, which was also the home of a strange moneylender. This moneylender was rumored to be capable of providing ‚Äúany sum to anyone,‚Äù but bizarre and terrible events always seemed to happen to those who borrowed from him. Specifically, his borrowers developed qualities contrary to their previous personalities: a sober man became a drunkard; a fine young nobleman turns on his wife and beats her. Many of his customers even died unnaturally early deaths. One day, the moneylender comes to the artist asking for his portrait to be painted, and the artist agrees, grateful for the chance to paint such a peculiar subject. However, as soon as he begins painting the moneylender's eyes, ‚Äúthere arose such a strange revulsion in his soul‚Äù he refused to paint any more. Despite the moneylender begging him to finish, the artist holds firm, and the moneylender dies shortly thereafter, leaving the portrait in the artist's possession. Inexplicably bizarre events begin happening in the artist's life. He becomes jealous of one of his pupils (revealed to be the young Chartkov), attempts to sabotage him, flies into rages, chases away his children and comes close to beating his wife. To make amends, the artist attempts to burn the portrait, but a friend stops him, taking the painting for his own instead. After witnessing its evil nature, his friend eventually passes the portrait to his nephew, who sells it to an art collector, who hawks it to someone else, and eventually the portrait's trail is lost. The artist feels immense guilt over the evil piece of art and makes his son promise to track it down and destroy it. This is the reason which brought the young man to the art auction. However, once he concludes his story and his audience turns to examine the portrait, they find it missing: someone must have taken it while they were listening to the young man's story. They wonder if they had seen it at all.  Influences  It has been argued that Gogol's influences can be traced to Western sources. That the plot of the demonic Kunstlernovelle seems largely derivative of Western authors such as E. T. A. Hoffmann, Edgar Allan Poe, Charles Robert Maturin or Washington Irving.Adrian Wanner Gogols \\"Portrait\\" Repainted: On Gary Shteyngart's \\"Shylock on the Neva\\", Canadian Slavonic Papers, Vol. 51, No. 2/3,(June‚ÄìSeptember 2009), pp. 333-348 Author Eva Gu√∞mundsd√≥ttir compares Poe with Gogol and places them both in a category of the fantastic.

Simon Karlinsky, The Sexual Labyrinth of Nikolai Gogol (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1976)112 This follows the general theme that is less humorous and more regarding artistic value. An explanation for this difference is offered in the hope of elevating the seriousness of the piece. That he forgoes the comic along with narrative polyphone in the interests of a high seriousness ‚Äòwhich he would only later recognize might be available without such crippling sacrifice.' Donald Fanger, The Creation of Nikolai Gogol (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1979) 114 He is aware with the other Tales that the comic aspect is what makes them attainable and interesting to the reader and by losing this crucial part the story loses its relatability and consequently its interest. Moreover, Innokentii Annenski agrees with the assessment that this is the most conventional of Gogol‚Äôs tales. He claimed that in this tale ‚Äòwhich he wrote twice, Gogol has put more of himself than in any of this other works.' I.F.Annenskii, ‚ÄòPloblema gogoevskogo iumora‚Äô, in Knigi otrazhenii I, II [reprint of the 1906 and 1909 edition] (Munich: Wilhelm Fink Verlag, 1969) 16 A key theme of the short story is to express the corrupting influence of money on art. This reflects a general concern among Russian writers in the 1830s about the degradation of culture under the condition of a nascent market economy that came to replace the previous aristocratic patronage system.See on this, Thomas Grob ‚ÄòInflation√§re Romantik: Kunst und Geld in der russischen K√ºnstlererz√§hlung der 1880er Jahre,‚Äô Wiener Slawistischer Almanach 54 (2001): 45-65 Indeed, as Robert Maguire has remarked, Chartkov ‚Äòturns himself completely into money, and in spending the money, he spends himself. When it is gone, so is he.‚ÄôRobert Maguire, Exploring Gogol (Palo Alto: Stanford University Press, 1994) 152 This speaks to two main themes of the story: The corruption of money and the destruction of illusion on reality. Chartkov's paintings are an ‚Äòillusion of an illusion‚Ä¶ as life imitates art and in turn is imitated by art, he becomes merely another version of each of the poses he renders.' Robert Maguire, Exploring Gogol (Palo Alto: Stanford University Press, 1994) 150  Relation to Petersburg Texts  In ‚ÄúThe Portrait,‚Äù Gogol deviates quite a bit from his conventional writing style; instead of adopting a humorous, even absurd style, he takes a fairly serious tone that is uncommon in his other works. Part of the reason for this change was the underlying purpose behind this piece; unlike his other stories, which had some serious elements but were generally defined by their amusing tone, ‚ÄúThe Portrait‚Äù was written partly to serve a form of social commentary.Basom, Ann Marie. ‚ÄúThe Fantastic in Gogol's Two Versions of \\"portret\\"‚Äù. The Slavic and East European Journal38.3 (1994): 419‚Äì437. Web. The piece was published in a collection of stories called Arabesques; in addition to ‚ÄúThe Portrait,‚Äù Arabesques also contained other darker works of Gogol, including arguably his most famous, ‚ÄúThe Diary of a Madman.\\" \\"Nikolay Gogol\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 2016. Web. 2 Mar. 2016. Loosely, scholars have grouped literary works that are focused on the failings of society (such as Arabesques) during the mid to late 1800s as Petersburg Texts. Dostoevsky is generally considered to be the most influential author of these texts, but many others contributed to them, including Gogol. Part of the reason Gogol felt the need to write stories showcasing the true nature of Saint Petersburg and the toxic atmosphere the city (and indeed, the country) bred was that he himself had lived there; he worked briefly there as a government clerk and was struck by ‚Äúthe utter lack of social interaction‚Äù among his colleagues at the time.Shapiro, Gavriel. ‚ÄúNikolai Gogol' and the Baroque Heritage‚Äù. Slavic Review 45.1 (1986): 95‚Äì104. Web. Gogol disapproved of the way in which workers focused solely on advancing in the civil servant system and conveyed this disapproval through his writing: He uses the character of Andrey as a vehicle to highlight the vices posed by greed and fortune that is achieved without actually working for it. Though Andrey is able to attain immediate wealth and fame because of the agreement he makes with the painting, he is eventually driven mad by the talent of other artists and pays the price for his ruthless pursuit of societal advancement. In terms of the city itself, Gogol noted that Saint Petersburg was remarkably bare of organic feeling, and as a result his depiction of it differed from those of authors such as Pushkin in that there was very little geometry depicted in the city. Famous landmarks such as the city's parks and trees were absent in his portrayal of Saint Petersburg in \\"The Portrait\\" as Gogol instead emphasized the grim, crowded appearance of its stores and buildings. In terms of the structure of the piece, Gogol did adhere to a set of guidelines generally shared with other Petersburg texts. Most prominently, \\"The Portrait\\" was grounded in a theme that reflected an underlying social problem, in this case being greed and the desperate pursuit of advancement. In addition, by the end of the story we are able to at least partially sympathize with the main character. Andrey ultimately regretted his decision to make the deal with the portrait and expresses remorse over it. As he reaches the end of his life and his sanity gradually gives way, he begins to destroy artwork without discrimination, and our initial disgust for Andrey over his deal with the painting is at least partially replaced with pity. In this way, Gogol demonstrates that though individuals can be flawed, redemption is still possible, albeit in a manner that the reader may not have been expecting. Other Petersburg texts, such \\"The Diary of a Madman\\" and Notes from Underground, followed similar patterns.  Reception  The Academic American Encyclopedia cited the work as an example of the \\"conflict between Gogol's idealistic strivings and his sad, cynical view of human propensities\\". First published in Arabesques, the story was received unfavorably by critics, and Gogol returned to the story, reworking it for the 1842 publication. Simon Karlinsky believes that the second version of the story, with its differing epilogue, works better within the context of the story, but writes that the work, while \\"a serious treatment of an important social problem\\", is \\"too slender a theme\\" to support the central thrust of the work, an attempt to portray \\"the great mystical concept of the Antichrist\\".  Legacy  Gogol's work has influenced the literature that followed. Adrian Wanner writes that Gary Shteyngart's work, ‚ÄòShylock on the Neva‚Äô, is a modern-day writing of ‚ÄòThe Portrait.'Adrian Wanner Gogols \\"Portrait\\" Repainted: On Gary Shteyngart's \\"Shylock on the Neva \\", Canadian Slavonic Papers, Vol. 51, No. 2/3,(June‚ÄìSeptember 2009), pp. 333-348 The main plot of ‚ÄòShylock on the Neva‚Äô is the same as that of ‚ÄòThe Portrait‚Äô. There is a wealthy St Petersburg man who asks a painter to do his portrait in order to fulfill his desire to be immortalized in art.Adrian Wanner Gogols \\"Portrait\\" Repainted: On Gary Shteyngart's \\"Shylock on the Neva\\", Canadian Slavonic Papers, Vol. 51, No. 2/3,(June‚ÄìSeptember 2009), pp. 333-348 Some critics have argued that humor is lacking in ‚ÄòThe Portrait‚Äô, Adrian Wanner argues that in rewriting the story, Shteyngart was attempting to ‚ÄòGogolize‚Äô his own tale.

Young Ottomans sought to transform Ottoman society by preserving the empire and modernizing along the European tradition of adopting a constitutional government. Though the Young Ottomans were frequently in disagreement ideologically, they all agreed that the new constitutional government should continue to be somewhat rooted in Islam to emphasize \\"the continuing and essential validity of Islam as the basis of Ottoman political culture\\" and syncretized Islamic ideals with liberalism and parliamentary democracy.Finkel 2006, p. 475. The Young Ottomans sought to revitalize the empire by incorporating certain European models of government, while still retaining the Islamic foundations of the empire.A History of the Modern Middle East. Cleveland and Buntin p.78 Among the prominent members of this society were writers and publicists such as ƒ∞brahim ≈ûinasi, Namƒ±k Kemal, Ali Suavi, Ziya Pasha, and Agah Efendi. In 1876, the Young Ottomans had their defining moment when Sultan Abdul Hamid II reluctantly promulgated the Ottoman constitution of 1876 (), the first attempt at a constitution in the Ottoman Empire, ushering in the First Constitutional Era. Although this period was short-lived, with Abdul Hamid II ultimately suspending the constitution and parliament in 1878 in favor of a return to absolute monarchy with himself in power,Finkel 2006, p. 489-490. the influence of the Young Ottomans continued until the collapse of the empire. Several decades later, another group of reform-minded Ottomans, the Young Turks, repeated the Young Ottomans' efforts, leading to the Young Turk Revolution in 1908 and the beginning of the Second Constitutional Era. Prominent figures Mehmed Bey, one of the founding members of the Young Ottomans. The prominent leaders and ideologists behind the Young Ottomans movement included: * Writers and publicists: ** ƒ∞brahim ≈ûinasi (1826-1871), founded the newspaper Tasvir-i Efk√¢r (\\"Illustration of Thoughts\\") in 1862 and imparted editorship of it to Namƒ±k Kemal in 1865.Z√ºrcher 2004, p. 67-68. ** Namƒ±k Kemal (1840-1888), one of the founding members of the Young Ottomans in 1865 and publisher of many opposition newspapers; helped draft the constitution.Z√ºrcher 2004, p. 398. ** Ziya Pasha (1825-1880), former secretariat of the palace who had been pressured out of his position and published newspapers in France with Namƒ±k Kemal.Z√ºrcher 2004, p. 406. ** Ali Suavi (1838-1878), a teacher and preacher with religious training who edited the newspaper Muhbir. (\\"Reporter\\") ** Mehmed Bey, a leading reformer and one of the founding members of the Young Ottomans;Mardin 2000, p. 12. nephew of Mahmud Nedim Pasha. * Political figures: ** Midhat Pasha (1842-1910), Ottoman prime minister (grand vizier) and reformer who drafted and implemented the constitution.√Ågoston 2008, p. 378-379. ** Mustafa Fazƒ±l Pasha (1842-1910), brother to the viceroy of Egypt and grandson of Muhammad Ali of Egypt, principal benefactor and supporter of the Young Ottomans after formally organizing them in 1867 in Paris.Z√ºrcher 2004, p. 69-70. History =Formation= The Belgrad Forest Picnic Refik Bey Re≈üat Bey In the summer of 1865, six young men convened at the Belgrad Forest (Turkish: Belgrad Ormanƒ±) near Istanbul for a picnic to form a group that would become known as the Patriotic Alliance and would be the nucleus of the future Young Ottomans.Mardin 2000, p. 10. Almost all of the men in attendance had at one time or another worked in the Translation Bureau of the Sublime Porte (the metonymy for the Ottoman government) and therefore had knowledge of both European political systems and the inner workings of Ottoman foreign policy.Mardin 2000, p. 11. The six men in attendance were Mehmed Bey, Namƒ±k Kemal, Men√¢pirz√¢de Nuri Bey, Re≈üat Bey, Ayetullah Bey, and Refik Bey, and all shared a desire to change the way the Ottomans interacted vis-√†-vis the European powers in addition to the nature of rule in the empire.Mardin 2000, p. 12-13. The group attracted a moderate number of followers. \\"In the course of two years, a few hundred people seem to have joined the society, among them two nephews of the Sultan, Prince Murad (the crown prince) and Prince Hamid.\\"Z√ºrcher 2004, p. 69. Exile to Paris During the same year, ƒ∞brahim ≈ûinasi left control of his newspaper Tasvir-i Efk√¢r to Namƒ±k Kemal, and it was under Kemal‚Äôs editorship that the paper became more radical.Z√ºrcher 2004, p. 68. In 1867, Namƒ±k Kemal and other Young Ottomans published the open letter of a disgruntled Egyptian prince Mustafa Fazƒ±l Pasha to the Ottoman Sultan Abd√ºlaziz. This letter advocated constitutional and parliamentary governance. After the publication, the Ottoman government cracked down on the Young Ottomans, causing them to flee to Paris, where they continued operating under the patronage of Mustafa Fazƒ±l Pasha. By the time these exiled publicists had come together under the patronage of Mustafa Fazƒ±l Pasha in Paris, they began calling themselves Yeni Osmanlƒ±lar ().Z√ºrcher 2004, p. 69-70. =Publications= Ziya Pasha Through the new medium of the press and with the financial support of their ally Mustafa Fazƒ±l Pasha, the Young Ottomans were able to widely circulate their ideas in a number of publications. One of the most important periodicals was H√ºrriyet (\\"Freedom\\"), which was publicized by Namƒ±k Kemal and Ziya Pasha beginning in 1868, though many others were published and often took a more radical stance.Z√ºrcher 2004, p. 70. Other Young Ottoman newspapers included Ulum (\\"Science\\"), Inkilab (\\"Revolution\\"), and Ibret (\\"Lesson\\").√Ågoston 2008, p. 604. These publications voiced dissent and opposition to Ottoman policies that ordinarily would have been stifled. These periodicals circulated widely throughout Europe, having sites of publication in \\"London, Geneva, Paris, Lyon, and Marseille.\\"Hanioƒülu 2008, p. 103. =Return from exile= When Mehmed Fuad Pasha and Mehmed Emin √Çli Pasha died in 1869 and 1871, respectively, two of the greatest obstacles to the initiatives of the Young Ottomans were now out of the picture, prompting a number of the exiles to return to Istanbul. The acceptance of Mustafa Fazƒ±l Pasha to a post under Sultan Abd√ºlaziz was also seen as evidence of imminent success. However, it was this return from exile that began to fracture the Young Ottomans, many of whom never shared any sort of established ideological consensus. Ali Suavi resigned from the group while Namƒ±k Kemal returned to Istanbul. Ziya Pasha, who had disagreed with Kemal, moved to Geneva to work on another newspaper.√Ågoston 2008, p. 604. With his new Grand Vizier Mahmud Nedim Pasha, Sultan Abd√ºlaziz reasserted his role as the absolute ruler, leaving many of the Young Ottomans disappointed after having been so hopeful that their reforms would be widely accepted.Finkel 2006, p. 478. = Crisis and the Constitutional revolution = The Crisis of 1873-1878 During the reign of Sultan Abd√ºlaziz, the Empire was experiencing a period of great financial hardship brought on by catastrophic drought and floods in Anatolia in 1873 and 1874. In an attempt to raise revenue, the government raised taxes on the surviving population, leading to discontent amongst the people. The financial difficulties were exacerbated by a global stock market crash in 1873.Z√ºrcher 2004, p. 72. Discontentment amongst the population grew, culminating in a series of revolts that broke out amongst the Christian peasants in the Balkans. Bosnia and Herzegovina were the first to experience rebellions, followed by Bulgaria in 1876.Z√ºrcher 2004, p. 72. Accusations of atrocities being committed by the Turks, particularly in Bulgaria, did not go unnoticed by Russia, who went to war with the Ottomans on April 24, 1877.Hanioƒülu 2008, p. 118. The Constitutional revolution According to Caroline Finkel, \\"the profound cultural dislocation and humiliation being experienced by the majority of Ottoman Muslims found expression at this juncture in strident criticism of the government for its appeasement of foreign powers.\\"Finkel 2006, p. 480. Due to the tumultuous environment, the Young Ottomans now had an audience, and action quickly followed. On May 30, 1876, a group of leading Ottoman politicians including Midhat Pasha staged a coup d‚Äô√©tat and deposed Sultan Abd√ºlaziz. Prince Murad, who was close with the Young Ottomans, was installed to the throne as Sultan Murad V. Murad had promised to institute the constitution, but he began to listen to his Grand Vizier R√º≈üdi Pasha, who advocated a cautious approach to reform. After the alleged suicide of Sultan Abd√ºlaziz, Sultan Murad‚Äôs mental state began to rapidly decline and he became an alcoholic. \\"The suicide of his uncle and the murder of several members of his cabinet seem to have led to a severe nervous breakdown.\\"Z√ºrcher 2004, p. 69. As a result, after only three months on the throne, Murad was declared unfit to rule and was replaced by his younger brother, Hamit Efendi, who ascended to the throne on September 1, 1876 as Sultan Abdul Hamid II.Z√ºrcher 2004, p. 73. First Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire The First Constitutional Era began on December 23, 1876, when Sultan Abdul Hamid II appointed Midhat Pasha as Grand Vizier and promulgated the Ottoman constitution of 1876, although his motives for doing so are suspect as they seemed to be aimed at appeasing Europeans who were in Istanbul for a conference.Hanioƒülu 2008, p. 117. Indeed, Abdul Hamid II \\"was distrusted by both the Porte and by intellectuals. The ministers knew that he was deceitful and cunning, and they suspected that his rule would mean a return to imperial control over the affairs of the state.\\"Mardin 2000, p. 72. The first Ottoman parliament, the General Assembly of the Ottoman Empire, convened from March 19, 1877 to June 28, 1877 and only convened once more before being prorogued by Abdul Hamid II, ironically using his constitutional right to do so on February 13, 1878. He also dismissed Midhat Pasha and banished him from the empire, effectively ending the first constitutional era and marking a return to centralization of power under the Sultan.Hanioƒülu 2008, p. 121. Ideology The Young Ottomans were not united by a single ideology and their views varied greatly within their own group. Yet they were brought together by a few central shared ideas and a common cause.Hanioƒülu 2008, p. 103. =Constitutionalism= The Young Ottomans were brought together by their shared dislike of the bureaucratic and appeasing form that the government had taken on with the advent of the Tanzimat reforms. \\"Young Ottomans strongly criticized the Tanzimat as a capitulation to European dictates\\", which they believed was one of the primary reasons for the poor state of the empire.Hanioƒülu 2008, p. 103. The Young Ottomans called for the development of a constitutional government that was grounded in Islamic concepts, not only to differentiate it from the European governments that they were looking to for inspiration, but also because they wished to preserve one of the core features of Ottoman culture.Finkel 2006, p. 478. \\"There was an emphasis on the fatherland and the idea that Ottomans should share devotion to their country. This marked the beginning of a common feeling of territorial patriotism.\\"A History of the modern middle east Cleveland and Buntin p.78 =Ottomanism= \\"One of the most noticeable ideas that came from the Young Ottoman movement was the idea of Ottoman Patriotism. This is the belief of Ottoman equality as citizens. This can be seen in Young Ottoman Namƒ±k Kemal's famous play Vatan.\\" The play explores the ideas of devotion and loyalties to territories and nations, rather than religious communities. \\"This was the beginning of territorial patriotism in the area.\\"A History of the modern middle east Cleveland and Buntin p.79 In the face of the emerging national identities in Europe, the desire for a definition of patriotic Ottoman identity became a unifying factor amongst many lead Young Ottomans. The desired goal of Ottomanism was to overcome the tensions between the Muslim and non-Muslim subjects of the empire and unite them through allegiance to the state. =Islamism= While the Young Ottomans looked to the Europeans for a model of constitutional government, they maintained that it should be developed within the framework of Islam to emphasize \\"the continuing and essential validity of Islam as the basis of Ottoman political culture.\\"Finkel 2006, p. 475. =Liberalism= The Young Ottomans syncretized islamic idealism with modern liberalism and parliamentary democracy, to them the European parliamentary liberalism was a model to follow, in accordance with the tenets of Islam and \\"attempted to reconcile Islamic concepts of government with the ideas of Montesquieu, Danton, Rousseau, and contemporary European Scholars and statesmen.\\" Namik Kemal, who was influential in the formation of the society, admired the constitution of the French Third Republic, he summed up the Young Ottomans' political ideals as \\"the sovereignty of the nation, the separation of powers, the responsibility of officials, personal freedom, equality, freedom of thought, freedom of press, freedom of association, enjoyment of property, sanctity of the home\\".Hanioƒülu, M. ≈û√ºkr√º (2008). A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire, Princeton University Press. . p. 104. Legacy and influence One of their greatest legacies of the Young Ottomans in the Ottoman Empire was in their actions, as they were \\"regarded as the first modern ideological movement among the Ottoman elite of the empire, and they were the first who, through their writings, consciously tried to create and influence public opinion.\\"Z√ºrcher 2004, p. 70. The use of the press as a tool of political criticism is also attributed to the innovation of the Young Ottomans.√Ågoston 2008, p. 604. Additionally, by assigning new meanings to liberal terminology, with terms such as vatan (\\"motherland\\") and h√ºrriyet (\\"liberty\\"), leading Young Ottomans such as Namƒ±k Kemal lent the powerful expression of ideologies to later nationalist and liberal groups within the Ottoman Empire.Z√ºrcher 2004, p. 69. As the first group to address the issue of Western modernity, future revolutionary movements such as the Young Turks drew both methods and ideology from the Young Ottomans, though they tended to focus on patriotic Ottomanism rather than their emphasis on a return to the fundamentals of Islam. Additionally, their efforts that contributed to the promulgation of the first Ottoman constitution set an important precedent for the Second Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire (1908-1918), which began with the Young Turks finally deposing Abdul Hamid II, the same monarch that the Young Ottomans had clashed with, from the throne in the Young Turk Revolution.Hanioƒülu 2008, p. 121.

Career  Josh MacPhee's work as a socially-engaged artist and designer focuses on production and distribution of political graphics. Originally from Holliston, MA, MacPhee was influenced at an early age by the work of Seth Tobocman and Peter Kuper. He attended Oberlin College and studied media and culture while publishing the zine Fenceclimber. After two years at Oberlin, MacPhee moved to Washington, D.C. where he helped create a community space called Beehive and collaborated on founding the D.C. chapter of the Anarchist Black Cross Network as part of MacPhee's broader burgeoning involvement in prison reform. MacPhee returned to Oberlin in 1994 and graduated in 1996, continuing his prison reform work on campus. Following graduation, he moved to Boulder, CO for a year to work with the Prison Rights Project, before moving to Chicago. His work against mass incarceration has continued, including a major 2013 public transit and commuter train design campaign with Philadelphia Mural Arts, and design campaigns with the Close Rikers campaign. In 2001 he co-organized the Department of Space and Land Reclamation in Chicago with Emily Forman and Nato Thompson. MacPhee also participated in Rising Up, an exhibition with Vanessa Renwick at Tollbooth Gallery and Toby Room in 2004 with the project Celebrate People‚Äôs History that featured wheat paste art along with experimental video in public spaces and included work by Cristy Road, Sabrina Jones, Carrie Moyer, Laura Whitehorn, David Lester, and Eric Drooker.https://www.academia.edu/2061114/Catalogue_for_the_first_year_at_the_Tollbooth_Gallery_published_in_printed_form_as_Toby_Room_10 date= accessdate=2015-10-16 As part of the God Bless Graffiti Coalition, he collected and exhibited the work of 275 graffiti artists from around the world; some of this material was later made available in a box set. MacPhee is featured in the film Creative violation: the rebel art of the street stencil. Josh MacPhee served as the juror for the Third Coast National in 2008, an exhibition of eclectic artworks by artists from across the United States at K Space Contemporary in Corpus Christi, Texas. In 2019, he served as a juror for the Scholastic Art & Writing Awards in the printmaking category. = Justseeds = MacPhee spent eight years as an artist and activist in Chicago, Illinois where he established a distribution system called justseeds in order get more radical art projects out to the public.Furfaro, Danielle (February 17, 2008). \\"The medium and the message: Josh MacPhee spreads his art and his activism through extensive networking\\", Times Union, p. H1. At its inception in 1999 Justseeds primarily functioned as a mail order system offering art by Josh MacPhee; now the Justseeds Artists' Cooperative is a cooperative of 25 like- minded artists. = Celebrate People's History Poster Project = The Celebrate People's History poster series originated during MacPhee's tenure in Chicago, and has become an ongoing project with the participation of artists from around the globe who create posters highlighting the contributions of important radical figures and events. The first poster in the series depicted Malcolm X, followed by a poster of John Brown. These are produced as educational materials and distributed inexpensively as a teaching tool on radical history. By 2018, over 100 designs had been printed in the series, with over 300,000 posters distributed, and an exhibition featuring selections from this project was mounted at the Brush Gallery at St. Lawrence University. = Spectres of Liberty = MacPhee was a member of the artist collaborative Spectres of Liberty with Olivia Robinson and Dara Greenwald, which used an inflatable reproduction of the Liberty Street Church to examine, spread awareness of, and create dialogue around the history of slavery and abolition in the United States.Greyser, N.

Their work as a collective was featured in volume 13 of Aspect Magazine. = Occuprint = As one of the first artists to respond to the Occupy Wall Street protests with artwork, MacPhee built on Adbuster's use of the image of the charging bull to make it a popular visual representation of the Occupy movement's focus on capitalism's destructive tendencies. His \\"Money Talks Too Much\\" poster featuring the charging bull was reproduced as a sign for protesters to carry at marches. MacPhee played a role in Occuprint, a group of volunteers who came together to curate and produce graphics for use in Occupy protests. The work of Occuprint focused on curating submissions of graphic material and making them available through a website, for reproduction around the world, thereby cultivating a network of graphic design material to be used as an organizing tool for Occupy movements worldwide. = Curatorial Work = MacPhee was curator of the politically charged printmaking exhibition, Paper Politics, which toured North America beginning in Chicago in 2004. It included an international group of approximately 200 artists including Sue Coe, Swoon, Sixten, Dara Greenwald, Tyler Kline, Meredith Stern and Meek, and focused on a broad range of political issues including peace, justice, social equity, and the environment; many works responded very directly to the war in Iraq. Various mediums were included in the show, including screenprint, stencil, and linocut. Every piece in the exhibition was printed by hand. Subsequent installation locations included 5+5 Gallery in Brooklyn, NY (2005-2006), Milwaukee (2006), Dowd Gallery at SUNY Cortland (September-October 2008), the Red House in Syracuse, NY (December 2008), Ghostprint Gallery in Richmond, VA (August 2009), West Central Illinois Arts Center (March-April 2010), and Space gallery in Pittsburgh, PA (August, 2010). In 2008 he co-curated the exhibition Signs of Change: Social Movement Cultures 1960's to Now with Dara Greenwald. This exhibition focused on material produced by activist movements around the world.Sellie, Alycia et al. ‚ÄúInterference Archive: A Free Space for Social Movement Culture.\\" Archival Science 15.4 (2015): 453-472.

This organization focuses on the intersection of social movements and cultural production, illustrating the history of social movement organizing through access to and display of cultural ephemera. MacPhee's personal collection of social movement publications, graphic material produced for organizing, and punk and DIY material culture, served as a major part of the original collection of Interference Archive alongside the collection of Dara Greenwald.

He batted and threw left-handed. He was tall and weighed . Baseball career The youngest of eight children, Dernell was the son of lumberjack James Stenson and his wife Cora. He starred in baseball at LaGrange High School in LaGrange, Georgia, the same high school attended by MLB outfielder Mike Cameron. There, Stenson attracted the attention of scouts for the Boston Red Sox, and he was selected in the third round with the ninety-first overall pick of the 1996 Major League Baseball Draft. Stenson advanced quickly through the low minor leagues before reaching a plateau at Triple-A. He spent parts of four seasons at the Red Sox' affiliate in Pawtucket before leaving the organization as a six-year minor league free agent. Stenson signed with the Cincinnati Reds for the season, and after performing well in the minors, including batting .306 with 14 home runs and a RBI total of 76 in 101 games with the Double-A Chattanooga Lookouts, he was called up in September. Stenson appeared in a total of 37 games, primarily as a left or right fielder, batting .247 with three home runs in 81 at-bats. After the season, Stenson was chosen to represent his organization in the Arizona Fall League (AFL). While playing with the Scottsdale Scorpions of the AFL, Stenson was murdered. The AFL suspended play for two days after Stenson's murder. In 2004, the league inaugurated the Dernell Stenson Sportsmanship Award, given to a player who displays the values of perseverance and humility. His number, 26, was posthumously retired by the Lookouts. Death investigation The incident initially appeared to be a carjacking; Stenson was bound, shot in the head and chest, and then run over with his own SUV, a 2002 Isuzu Rodeo.Stenson shot, apparently run over Information which surfaced following the murder indicated that it may have been the culmination of a more elaborate scheme. Stenson had received threatening text messages from his former girlfriend Jennifer Gaddis, including one that said \\"U better pray I never see you U again. I swear Dernell U R worth a Murder charge 4 & that is all U R worth.\\" She had engaged in odd behavior before, having faked both a pregnancy and a suicide in order to attract Stenson's attention. Police searched Gaddis' home and place of work and questioned her extensively, but concluded that she was not involved. Four men were ultimately arrested for the crime, with robbery stated as motive. Reginald Riddle and David Griffith were both charged with six felonies, among them first-degree murder, kidnapping, and armed robbery. Reginald Riddle agreed to a plea to avoid a possible death sentence. He received a sentence of 25 years to life in prison in exchange for testifying against his co-defendant, David Griffith. Prosecutors elected to seek the death penalty for Griffith. Kevin Riddle (Reginald's half-brother), pleaded guilty to charges of auto theft, hindering prosecution, and attempted hindering prosecution. He received a sentence of eight years and nine months in prison. Charges against a fourth man, Robert Maye, were dropped after it was determined that he was a protected federal witness who had testified against the Chicago-based Gangster Disciples street gang. In December 2007, Griffith was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole after pleading guilty to murder, armed robbery, and kidnapping. Riddle pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in 2006 as a part of a plea bargain; on January 25, 2008, he was sentenced to life in prison but will be eligible for parole in 2033, 25 years into his life sentence.Man guilty of killing Stenson sentenced to life in prison See also *List of baseball players who died during their careers References External links *Crime - The mysterious death of a baseball player from Georgia. by Taylor Bruce, Oxford American Magazine, Issue 59, Winter 2007, \\"The Sports Issue\\" Category:1978 births Category:2003 deaths Category:2003 murders in the United States Category:African-American baseball players Category:√Åguilas Cibae√±as players Category:Baseball players from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Cincinnati Reds players Category:Deaths by firearm in Arizona Category:Murders by motor vehicle Category:Major League Baseball left fielders Category:Major League Baseball right fielders Category:American murder victims Category:Murdered African-American people Category:Murdered American baseball players Category:People murdered in Arizona ","title":"Dernell Stenson"},{"id":"2382528","text":"Aliz√© is a line of alcoholic drinks.

She was appointed in January 2018 as Special Adviser on Africa for the United Nations after having served as Commissioner for Social Affairs at the African Union Assembly of Heads of State and Government, from 2002 to 2012. She was a Commissioner on the Public Service Commission in Namibia from 1991 to 1996, and an Ombudswoman in the Namibian Government from 1996 to 2003. She has also been a lecturer in Gender Law at the University of Namibia, Director of the Board of the Central Bank of Namibia, and involved in many non-governmental organizations including Secretary-General of the Namibian National Women's Organization and patron of Namibian Federation of Persons with Disabilities. As Chairperson of the Law Reform Commission she oversaw the passage of the Married Persons' Equality Act. The commission also did extensive work on Rape Acts and other important laws that were eventually passed after her time. Early life and education Bience is the daughter of Philemon Gawanab and Hilde Rheiss. She attended secondary school at St Theresa Catholic school in Tses, «ÅKaras Region, southern Namibia. From Tses she went to University of the Western Cape (UWC) in Cape Town, South Africa, to study law; Catholic sponsors helped her resist the pressure of apartheid officials to switch careers from law to nursing. She was expelled from UWC after the Soweto uprisings in 1976. After her expulsion she became an active member of SWAPO Youth League in Namibia and a teacher. She went into exile and lived in Zambia, Angola and Cuba. In 1981 the International Labour Organization sponsored her as an intern at their headquarters and subsequently on a labour law study. After this Africa Educational Trust sponsored her through a law degree at University of Warwick, UK. She graduated in 1987 and qualified as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn, London in 1988. Namibia was occupied illegally by South Africa until 1990. \\"When I decided to study law, a white schools inspector told me that as a black child my intelligence was lower than that of a white child and that maybe law was not meant for me,\\" she said to one interviewer. \\"Today I am a lawyer and I have proved that intelligence has got nothing to do with a person's colour.\\" Gawanas's interest in law was sparked after her beloved elder brother Jeka was picked up by whites and beaten to death while hitch- hiking, and police decided it was a \\"road accident\\". Biography Her practical training included work with Lord Tony Gifford on human rights cases such as the \\"Birmingham Six\\" appeal of alleged bombers who were later exonerated. Throughout her exile, Bience continued to campaign for Namibia's freedom from South African rule. In 1988 she travelled to Zambia to visit her daughter and was detained by SWAPO. Over an extended period the movement detained many thousands of Namibians as part of a \\"spy scare\\". These allegations were never proved despite months of solitary confinement and torture. Gawanas later became one of the first Namibians to return alive from the \\"dungeons\\" in Lubango, Southern Angola, in 1989, some months before many other surviving detainees were released. By July 1989, she and her daughter were repatriated by the United Nations and were back on Namibian soil. Her first job back in Namibia from exile was with Advocate Anton Lubowski, which ended when apartheid agents murdered Lubowski on his front doorstep in an unsuccessful attempt to destabilize the 1989 UN-supervised elections. She then worked as with the public-interest Legal Assistance Centre until 1991 when she was appointed by Parliament to the Public Service Commission of Namibia. Her work there included extensive rebalancing of the Namibian civil service. President Sam Nujoma appointed her Ombudsman, on recommendation of the Judicial Services Commission, in 1996 and she served there, investigating and resolving complaints of maladministration at all levels, until 2003. She also served as Executive Secretary of the African Ombudsman Association. In July 2003 Gawanas was elected by the African Heads of State as Commissioner of Social Affairs for the African Union Commission, based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. She has been seeking to increase the profile of social development issues on the continental agenda. She was elected for two terms, in 2003 and 2008, and after completing her second term in October 2012, she returned to Namibia where she became Special Advisor to the Minister of Health and Social Services. In January 2018 Gawanas was appointed Special Adviser on Africa for the United Nations by UN Secretary‚ÄëGeneral Ant√≥nio Guterres. She serves at the level of Under-Secretary-General. In May 2020, Gawanas was selected to serve on the first Board of Trustees of the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) following their groundbreaking governance reform. Awards The University of the Western Cape awarded her a Doctor legum honoris causa at their September 2012 graduation ceremony.

It was established in 1854 as Salem Normal School. , Salem State enrolled 7,664 undergraduate and 1,637 graduate, full- and part-time students, from 27 states and 57 foreign countries. The university offers bachelor's and master's degrees in the arts and sciences, Master of Business Administration, and Post Masters Certificates in more than 40 academic disciplines. In addition, the university also offers continuing education courses for credit and non-credit. History Salem State University was founded in 1854 as the Salem Normal School under the guidance of Horace Mann. The Salem Normal School is the fourth normal school to open in Massachusetts, and only the tenth to open in the United States. Initially, the school was a 2-year, post-secondary educational institution reserved for women. In 1898, the school became co- educational by enrolling its first group of male students that September. In 1896 the school relocated to its current location in South Salem (to the building known today as the Sullivan Building). A few years later the Horace Mann Laboratory School was opened. With the construction of a more formal campus, the school was able to lengthen its curriculum to a 4-year study program in 1921. The first bachelor's degree program was in commercial education. In 1932, the school was renamed Salem Teachers College. In 1960, the school was renamed State Teachers' College at Salem, and shortly thereafter in 1968 the school was renamed to Salem State College. Salem State's physical campus, restricted to North Campus at the time, developed quite rapidly during the 1960s under the leadership of President Frederick Meier. Peabody and Bowditch Halls were built on North Campus in 1965. Bowditch hall reflected the trends of multiple-story building construction during the first half of the Cold War, with a fallout shelter being built under the building with a capacity of 985 people. Meier Hall was also constructed in 1965, and the Ellison Campus Center shortly thereafter in 1966. Throughout the 1970s, the school continued to expand its physical campus by constructing a new library, the O‚ÄôKeefe Athletic Center, and by purchasing the land for what is today known as South Campus. In the mid-1990s, the college moved forward with purchasing a 37.5-acre industrial site on Loring Avenue. The site was formerly home to a lightbulb plant owned by the General Telephone & Electronics Corporation, formerly Sylvania Electric Products. When GTE decided to exit the electrical equipment market, they sold off their former factory to Salem State. That site, is today known as Central Campus. It houses the Bertolon School of Business and three residence complexes: Viking Hall, Marsh Hall and Atlantic Hall. On July 26, 2010, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick signed into law a bill that changed the name of institution to Salem State University. The name change became official on October 26, 2010. Academics Salem State University comprises six academic sub-units: https://www.salemstate.edu/academics *Bertolon School of Business (3 departments) *College of Arts and Sciences (20 departments) *Maguire Meservey College of Health and Human Services (3 departments, 2 schools: School of Nursing, School of Social Work) *School of Education (2 departments) *School of Continuing and Professional Studies *School of Graduate Studies The university is also home to the Salem State University Honors Program, an approved constituent of the statewide Massachusetts Commonwealth Honors Program. https://www.mass.edu/system/honors.asp = Honor societies = In addition to hosting chapters of various disciplinary honor societies, e.g. Delta Mu Delta for business students, the university hosts chapters of two national cross-disciplinary honor societies: *Alpha Lambda Delta *Phi Kappa Phi = Global partnerships = Salem State University has partnered with several universities in the People‚Äôs Republic of China through a consortium overseen by the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, AASCU, https://www.salemstate.edu/academics/centers/center-international- education/china-international-exchange including a cohort-based program in English with students from Nanjing Normal University. https://www.aascu.org/programs/InternationalPrograms/ChinaInitiatives/ The university has also entered into partnership with four other international institutions: https://www.salemstate.edu/academics/centers/center- international-education/global-partnerships *University of Mannheim, Germany *D'Annunzio University of Chieti‚ÄìPescara, Italy *Catholic University of Lublin, Poland *University of Guanajuato, Mexico Campus Edward Sullivan Building at the intersection of Lafayette Street and Loring Avenue.

Joseph Cardijn in Belgium as the Young Trade Unionists; the organization adopted its present name in 1924. Its French acronym, JOC, gave rise to the then widely used terms Jocism and Jocist. In 1925, the JOC received Papal approbation, and in 1926 spread to France and eventually to 48 countries.  YCW in the past  JOC Quebec in 1939 Cardijn blamed the death of his father, a mineworker, on harsh labor conditions. Working-class Belgians of the era tended to see the Church as serving the interests of the aristocracy, and some old friends considered Cardijn a traitor; he thus decided to devote his career to \\"reconciling his Church with the industrial workers of the world.\\" When Cardijn was first made an assistant priest in the Brussels suburb Royal Laeken in 1912, he began to work with factory workers. In 1915, he became the director of the city's Catholic social work. In the years after the First World War, he began to organize young Catholic workers in the Brussels area to evangelize their colleagues; the group was named Jeunesse Ouvri√®re Chr√©tienne. Its teachings were based on labor encyclicals by Popes Leo XIII and Pius XI. It received approval from Pius XI in 1925. Time Magazine, reporting on a Paris rally with 75,000 members in 1938, quoted Cardijn as telling his followers, \\"\\"Every Jocist has a Divine mission from God, second only to that of the priest, to bring the whole world to Christ.\\" Cardijn devoted the rest of his life to the movement, and in 1957 the JOC held its first world council in Rome. Cardijn served as an advisor to Vatican II and was made a Cardinal in 1965. In England, the first section of the YCW was set up by Father Gerrard Rimmer in February 1937 at St Joseph's RC Church in Wigan, Lancashire.See 'Those Were The Days', St Jude's RC Church Archive Accompanied by parishioners Jim Tickle, Tommy Sullivan, Larry Sharkey, Pat Keegan, Jim O'Brien, and Frank Foster, Fr Rimmer travelled to Belgium to visit Cardinal Cardijn in the same year. Pat Keegan would go on to become the first International Young Christian Workers President in 1945. A post he held until 1957. He then took the role of Secretary General at the World Movement of Christian Workers.  Today's YCW  Nowadays the YCW is organized in Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa and the Americas. The international headquarters are located in Brussels, Belgium. The International YCW (IYCW) is a Non Governmental International Movement actively present in over 51 countries with members between the ages of 15 and 35. Thanks to its work with young people, the England branch is a member of The National Council for Voluntary Youth Services (NCVYS). The IYCW has 4 official branches, the Panafrican YCW, YCW of the Americas, YCW Europe, and YCW Asia Pacific. IYCW adopted \\"Social Protection for all\\" as its International Campaign for the next four years in the 12th International Council held in Thanjavur, India, from 29 September to 12 October 2008.

Told in a mockumentary format and employing the found-footage technique, the fictional film appears to tell the story of a man convicted in 1995 of murdering his team of people one night during an expedition to find the mythic Jersey Devil in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. The Last Broadcast is believed to be the first feature-length film shot and edited entirely on consumer-level digital equipment. Plot The film deals with a documentary film-maker named David Leigh, and his investigation of the Fact or Fiction murders. In this case, a pair of cable TV hosts of public-access television were murdered in mysterious circumstances. The body of one was never found. Leigh seeks to discover the truth behind these killings while making his documentary. Fact or Fiction is a show dealing with unsolved mysteries and the paranormal. Its two hosts are Steven \\"Johnny\\" Avkast and Locus Wheeler. (Although it was initially a success, Leigh's later investigations find that the show is failing and is threatened with imminent cancellation.) At this point Avkast comes up with the idea of a live Internet Relay Chat section of the show. A caller suggests the team search for the Jersey Devil, a mythic figure associated with the Pine Barrens. Avkast and Wheeler recruit Rein Clackin, a sound-man who allegedly can record the paranormal, and Jim Suerd, a psychic. Leigh later says that Suerd is emotionally disturbed. The plan is for the four men to go to the Pine Barrens, where Suerd will lead them to the site of the Jersey Devil. During the hunt, they will broadcast a live show simultaneously via television, Internet, and amateur radio. They enter the Barrens, but only Suerd emerges alive. The others are brutally murdered, and Avkast's body is never found. Suerd was the only suspect, and was charged with murder of the others. During his murder trial, testimony shows that Avkast could not have survived, given the loss of blood found at the crime scene. Leigh summarizes the trial. The prosecution has bolstered their case by the work of a video engineer (nicknamed \\"The Killer Cutter\\"), who compiles a documentary of the group's trip, using the surviving film footage found at the crime scene. Suerd is found guilty and imprisoned. Some observers doubt his guilt, because his clothes were not bloody. In addition, there is evidence he was engaged in an IRC room at the times of the murders. Before his conviction can be appealed, Suerd dies in prison of unknown causes. Authorities consider the case closed. Leigh receives a box containing a damaged videotape reel, which he at first assumes is tape from the Fact or Fiction team, although none was believed to exist. He hires data retrieval expert Shelly Monarch to reconstruct the images on the tape. She finds that Wheeler and Clacklin's murders were caught on tape, and Suerd could not have killed them. She finds a blurred image of the real killer. As Leigh videotapes her, Monarch uses an image editor to re- construct the image of the killer's face. She completes this image before Leigh's next visit, and is shocked to discover that the killer is Leigh himself. The camera 'shifts' to a third-person perspective, whereas all previous footage had been \\"shot\\" by Leigh. From this perspective, viewers see Leigh attack Monarch and suffocate her with a piece of plastic sheeting. He loads her body into his car, drives it out to the woods, and dumps it in a clearing. He begins to tape himself narrating the next segment of his documentary. Cast Release The Last Broadcast was released theatrically in the United States on October 23, 1998, and grossed $12,097 at the U.S. box office. Reception The film received mixed reviews from critics and audiences, earning an approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes of 44% based on 16 critic reviews. The film is sometimes erroneously cited as an influence on The Blair Witch Project, but the concept for that film was developed in 1993 and production began in October 1997, five months before the premiere of The Last Broadcast.\\"Editorial: 'Blair Witch Project' v.

Note that this is a different book than the Sefer Raziel HaMalakh, which was given to Adam by the same angel, but they stem from the same tradition, and large parts of Sefer HaRazim were incorporated into the Sefer Raziel under its original title. It is thought to be a sourcebook for Jewish magic, calling upon angels rather than God to perform supernatural feats. The text itself was once considered to be part of \\"orthodox\\" Judaism under the influence of Hellenism, but this text, along with some other works, are considered to be unorthodox or heretical in modern Judaism.  Discovery  The text was rediscovered in the 20th century by Mordecai Margalioth, a Jewish scholar visiting Oxford in 1963, using fragments found in the Cairo Geniza. He hypothesised that several fragments of Jewish magical literature shared a common source and was certain that he could reconstruct this common source. He achieved this in 1966 when he published Sefer HaRazim. The first English translation of the book was undertaken by Michael A. Morgan in 1983; the book is now in print, as of summer 2007. A new scholarly edition of the main extant manuscript including Hebrew and Judeo-Arabic Geniza fragments and a 13th- century Latin translation was prepared by Bill Rebiger and Peter Sch√§fer in 2009, with plans for a translation and commentary in German.  Dating  Margalioth places the date of the original text to the early fourth or late third century CE. This date is almost universally accepted; a notable exception is Ithamar Gruenwald who dates the text to the sixth or seventh century. Nonetheless, it is clear that this text predates Kabbalistic texts, including the Zohar (thirteenth century), the Bahir (thirteenth century as well), and possibly the proto-Kabbalistic Sefer Yetzirah (fourth century). There are certain textual clues that point toward this early date, specifically the reference to \\"the Roman indictions in 1:27-28 [which] gives a clear terminus a quo of 297 CE\\" (Morgan 8).  Structure and content  The book is split into seven sections, not including a preface which details the book's reception and transmission. Each of the first six sections corresponds to one heaven and contains a listing of angels and instructions to perform one or more magical rites. Only the throne of God and the four hayots are in the seventh heaven. There is an uneasy tension between the orthodox cosmogony of the book and the unorthodox praxeis embodied in these magical rites; the book has obviously been edited by a rabbinical scribe, but the \\"popular religion\\" contained in the book is more or less intact. Some of the rituals purport to facilitate healing, prophecy, an attack upon one's enemy, and gaining good fortune. The number seven, the importance of divine names, and the prevalence of sympathetic magic all have significance in the literature of Middle Eastern magic. The text demonstrates strong syncretism of Jewish and Greek traditions; an example is a prayer to the sun god Helios to invoke him at night: The prayer is preceded by instructions to call on several angels 21 times as well as the name of the sun. The reader is told to perform the ritual in white garments.  References   Sources  Levy, B. Barry. Sepher Ha-Razim, Unpublished manuscript and English translation, McGill University.

In coding theory, Tanner graphs are used to construct longer codes from smaller ones. Both encoders and decoders employ these graphs extensively.  Origins  Tanner graphs were proposed by Michael TannerR. Michael Tanner Professor of Computer Science, School of Engineering University of California, Santa Cruz Testimony before Representatives of the United States Copyright Office February 10, 1999 as a means to create larger error correcting codes from smaller ones using recursive techniques. He generalized the techniques of Elias for product codes. Tanner discussed lower bounds on the codes obtained from these graphs irrespective of the specific characteristics of the codes which were being used to construct larger codes.  Tanner graphs for linear block codes  Tanner graph with subcode and digit nodes Tanner graphs are partitioned into subcode nodes and digit nodes. For linear block codes, the subcode nodes denote rows of the parity-check matrix H. The digit nodes represent the columns of the matrix H. An edge connects a subcode node to a digit node if a nonzero entry exists in the intersection of the corresponding row and column.  Bounds proved by Tanner  Tanner proved the following bounds Let R be the rate of the resulting linear code, let the degree of the digit nodes be m and the degree of the subcode nodes be n . If each subcode node is associated with a linear code (n,k) with rate r = k/n, then the rate of the code is bounded by : R \\\\geq 1 - (1 - r)m \\\\,  Computational complexity of Tanner graph based methods  The advantage of these recursive techniques is that they are computationally tractable. The coding algorithm for Tanner graphs is extremely efficient in practice, although it is not guaranteed to converge except for cycle-free graphs, which are known not to admit asymptotically good codes.T.

It was built around the year 900 AD during the reign of King Yasovarman. Fed by the Siem Reap River flowing down from the Kulen Hills, it was the second-largest baray in the Angkor region (after the West Baray) and one of the largest handcut water reservoirs on Earth, measuring roughly 7.5 by 1.8 kilometers and holding over 50 million cubic meters of water. Stones bearing inscriptions that mark the construction of the baray have been found at all four of its corners.Higham, C., 2001, The Civilization of Angkor, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, The labour and organization necessary for its construction were staggering: Its dikes contain roughly 8 million cubic meters of fill. Scholars are divided on the purpose of this and other barays. By some theories, they held water for irrigation, but no inscription has been found mentioning such a function. Other theories say that barays served primarily a symbolic purpose in Khmer religious life, representing the seas of creation that surround Mount Meru, home of the Hindu gods. The East Baray today contains no water; farmers till crops on its bed. But its outlines remain clearly visible in satellite photographs. In the middle of the baray is the East Mebon temple, located on elevated ground that was an island in the days when the baray contained water.

It is on the west bank of the Willamette River in the northeastern corner of the southwest section of the city and where most of the city's high-rise buildings are found. The downtown neighborhood extends west from the Willamette to Interstate 405 and south from Burnside Street to just south of the Portland State University campus (also bounded by I-405), except for a part of northeastern portion north of SW Harvey Milk Street and east of SW 3rd Ave that belongs to the Old Town Chinatown neighborhood. High-density business and residential districts near downtown include the Lloyd District, across the river from the northern part of downtown, and the South Waterfront area, just south of downtown in the South Portland neighborhood. Portland's downtown features narrow streets-- wide--and square, compact blocks on a side, to create more corner lots that were expected to be more valuable. The small blocks also made downtown Portland pleasant to walk through. The long combined blocks divide one mile (1.6 km) of road into exactly 20 separate blocks. By comparison, Seattle's blocks are , and Manhattan's east‚Äìwest streets are divided into blocks that are from long.  Urban development  =1970s‚Äì1990s= Downtown Portland in 1973 Downtown Portland in 2007 By the early 1970s, parts of Portland's central city had been in decay for some time. New suburban shopping malls in the neighboring cities of Beaverton, Tigard, and Gresham competed with downtown for people and money. Unlike many downtown revitalization efforts around the United States at this time, Portland's plan did not call for widespread demolition and reconstruction. Robert Moses, the designer of New York City's gridded freeways, expressways, and bridges, designed a plan to revitalize downtown Portland. Moses charted a highway loop around the city's central freeways, which would become Interstate 405 as it links with I-5 south of downtown. Additionally the creation of a downtown transit mall in 1977, a new waterfront park in 1978 (later named after Governor Tom McCall) in place of a freeway, the creation of the Pioneer Courthouse Square in 1984, the opening of the Portland‚ÄìGresham light rail line in 1986, and the opening of Pioneer Place mall in 1990 successfully drew or retained businesses and lured customers. After 1990, downtown Portland dominated the city's development, with more development there than on the east side (Lloyd District, Central Eastside Industrial District, and Lower Albina). =2000s‚Äì2010s= Downtown has numerous surface parking lots, which contradict the city's efforts to promote higher density and create the storefronts needed for a vibrant downtown. Some changes are being made slowly, such as the creation of the Smart Park garage system, and conversion of a surface-level parking lot into a park with underground parking at Park Block 5 between the Fox Tower and Park Avenue West Tower.  Bridges  Portland is sometimes known as \\"Bridgetown,\\" due to the number of bridges that cross its two rivers. There are nine bridges entering downtown and immediately adjacent areas. The bridges are (north to south): * Fremont Bridge, carrying I-405 past the Pearl and Northwest districts and into downtown * Broadway Bridge, connecting the Lloyd District to Old Town Chinatown and carrying the Portland Streetcar's east-side line * Steel Bridge, the only double-deck bridge with independent lifts in the world, and carrying MAX Light Rail and Amtrak into Old Town Chinatown * Burnside Bridge, connecting the east side to downtown and the Old Town Chinatown neighborhood * Morrison Bridge, leading directly into the central business district from the east side * Hawthorne Bridge, Portland's oldest highway bridge and, leading directly into the central business district from the east side; Oregon's most heavily used bridge for bicycles * Marquam Bridge, a two-deck bridge carrying I-5 traffic * Tilikum Crossing, Portland's newest bridge, limited to public transit, bicycles, pedestrians, and emergency vehicles * Ross Island Bridge, which connects U.S. Route 26 (SE Powell Blvd.) to the South Waterfront Outside the downtown area there are three other road bridges within Portland limits that cross the Willamette River: the St. Johns Bridge and Sauvie Island Bridge (to the north) and the Sellwood Bridge (to the south).  Transportation  Most streets in downtown Portland are one-way. Naito Parkway (two-way, formerly known as Front Avenue) is the farthest east, while most of the high-rises end by I-405 to the west. Interstate 5 runs on the opposite bank of the river, crossing over on the Marquam Bridge. U.S. Route 26 connects downtown Portland to the Oregon Coast and the Cascade Range. Downtown is also served by several forms of public transportation. TriMet, the regional mass transit agency, operates MAX light rail on two alignments in downtown, one running east/west on Yamhill and Morrison streets and north‚Äìsouth on 1st Avenue, the other running north‚Äìsouth on 5th and 6th avenues. On the latter two streets, an extensive transit mall‚Äîknown as the Portland Mall‚Äîlimits private vehicles and provides connections between more than fifty bus lines, MAX light rail, and the Portland Streetcar. The southern part of downtown and the West End are also served by the Portland Streetcar system, operating from South Waterfront north into the Pearl and Northwest Portland districts. The system currently has two routes, measuring end to end, and connects in South Waterfront with the Tram (aerial cableway) to Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). Starting in 1975 and continuing for almost four decades, all transit service in downtown was free, as downtown was entirely within TriMet's Fareless Square, which also covered a portion of the nearby Lloyd District after 2001. However, in 2010, free rides became limited to MAX and streetcar service ‚Äì no longer covering bus service ‚Äì and the zone renamed the \\"Free Rail Zone\\", and in September 2012 the fareless zone was discontinued entirely, because of a $12 million shortfall in TriMet's annual budget.

Biography George Hanger was born into a prosperous family in Gloucestershire, the third son in a family of seven children. His father was Gabriel Hanger, a member of parliament who in 1762 was created Baron Coleraine in the Peerage of Ireland. As a younger son, Hanger's education was geared towards his entering the army. He was sent to Reading School and then Eton before going to the University of G√∂ttingen. After joining the Prussian Army of Frederick the Great, he returned to England and in 1771 purchased an Ensigncy in the 1st Regiment of Footguards. In the army Hanger gained the reputation of being a womaniser to the detriment of his military duties. In 1776 he purchased a lieutenancy, but he resigned his commission in disgust after a more junior officer purchased promotion over him. He then purchased a captaincy in a German J√§ger rifle company bound for North America to campaign in the American Revolutionary War. He served as aide-de-camp to Sir Henry Clinton during the siege of Charleston, South Carolina in 1776. Later during the war Hanger transferred back to British service with Banastre Tarleton's Legion as a major and as commander of its light dragoons. In the Battle of Charlotte of 1780, Hanger commanded the legion due to Tarleton's illness, ordering it to ride into Charlotte, North Carolina without taking precautions to guard against surprise attacks. As a consequence, the legion's cavalry was badly mauled by Patriot militia that had set up an ambush in the town centre. Hanger was wounded in the battle, which he termed a \\"trifling insignificant skirmish\\". He shortly thereafter fell ill, probably with yellow fever, and was shipped to the Bahamas to recuperate. He also became involved in a minor literary feud, in 1789, publishing An Address to the Army; In Reply To 'Strictures', by Roderick M'Kenzie (Late Lieutenant in the 71st Regiment) On Tarleton's History of the Campaigns of 1780 and 1781. The full title of M'Kenzie's book was Strictures on Colonel Banaster Tarleton's History of the Southern Campaigns of 1780 and 1781 and was itself critical of Tarleton's 1787 account of the southern campaigns called A History of the Campaigns of 1780 and 1781 in the Southern Provinces of North America. After returning to England, he became a companion of the Prince of Wales (later King George IV).Dictionary of national biography, vol.24 (1890) They became great friends, the prince apparently admiring Hanger's sense of humour and his exploits, both military and with women, and appointing him Equerry in 1791. The only surviving painting of Hanger comes from this period. Commissioned by the Prince, it remains in the Royal Collection. Hanger was also the butt of caricaturists and many prints of him survive. The British Museum Department of Prints and Drawings has numerous prints featuring him by James Gillray, Isaac Cruikshank, George Cruikshank and others. The National Portrait Gallery in London has a collection of twenty prints by James Gillray satirising him.National Portrait Gallery index for George Hanger Caricature of Col.George Hanger by James Gillray, published 1796 Through his friendship with the Prince of Wales, Hanger associated with the parliamentary opposition politicians of the day. A number of prints show him in the circle of Charles James Fox, a prominent Whig opponent of the Tory prime minister William Pitt the Younger in the last years of the 18th century. Hanger is also depicted as a supporter of the reformist Member of Parliament Francis Burdett in the early 1800s. In 1795 Hanger purchased the Lieutenant-Colonelcy of the 125th Foot, and six months later he exchanged his commission into one of the same rank in the 1st Battalion the 82nd Foot. In need of money, in 1796 he sold his lieutenant-colonelcy and purchased an ensigncy in the 70th Foot. He was imprisoned for debt in the King's Bench Prison from June 1798 to April 1799. In 1800 he set up in business as a coal merchant. In 1806 he was appointed captain-commissary in the Royal Artillery, but retired in March 1808 on full pay. In addition to the Address to the army, Hanger was the author of several books on military and other matters. He wrote two polemical works arguing in favour of reinforcing the country's defences against the threat of invasion by the French during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. In 1801 he published a two-volume autobiography (co-authored by William CombeBritish Library main catalogue, entry for George Hanger, Baron Coleraine.), The life, adventures and opinions of Col. George Hanger, a freewheeling work describing his early life and his military career in America, interspersed with observations on the King's Bench Prison and female prostitution. It contains the prediction that one day the northern and southern states \\"will fight as vigorously against each other as they both have united to do against the British\\".Life, adventures and opinions. Vol.2, p.473. His last work, Colonel George Hanger to all sportsmen (1814), concerned field sports, on which he was an acknowledged authority. On the death of his brother William, the 3rd Baron, in December 1814, the barony of Coleraine descended to Hanger, but he declined to assume the title. He died in London in 1824, whereupon the peerage became extinct. Little is known about Hanger's personal life. His autobiography tells the colourful story of a youthful marriage to a gypsy, who left him for a tinker. He was survived by a second wife, Mary Anne (possibly his housekeeper) and a son, John Greenwood Hanger (baptised 1817, died 1847).Baptisms solemnized in the Parish of St Pancras, in the County of Middlesex, in the year 1817.

It covers 370 hectares of once low-lying land on either side of the Mithi river, Vakola Nalla and Mahim Creek. The area had poor surface drainage and was severely affected by pollution in the Mahim Creek. One of the important features of the channelisation of Mithi river and Vakola nalla was to improve water carrying capacity and reduce pollution. Mithi River for about 4.5 km of its length from Mahim Causeway to C.S.T. Road Bridge and its tributary Vakola Nalla, for 2.5 km of its length, have been channelised for an average 60 m and 40 m bed widths respectively, thereby improving the hydraulic features of these two important water courses in the BKC area. The commercial development in BKC includes private and government offices (state and central), banks, wholesale establishments, etc. and will provide ultimately about 2,000,000 jobs in the area. The MMRDA has so far developed 19 hectares of marshy land in the 'E' Block where a number of office buildings have been constructed. These buildings together provide an office space of 174,000 square metres with a potential to accommodate 17,400 jobs. An Urban Plaza and Park named 'CITY PARK' has been developed on an area of about 22,500 square metres in this block. In recent years, BKC overtook Bombay Central to become the third most- prominent business district in Maharashtra, after Mumbai's Nariman Point and Cuffe Parade. However, a lack of public transportation options in the area (including rail, metro, etc.), in addition to the soft marshland on which BKC is based, have challenged the further development of the area, such as the construction of skyscrapers and high-rises. Despite this, it is expected by 2030 that BKC and Parel will be more prominent commercial hubs than Nariman Point and Cuffe Parade. G Block and International Finance and Business Center (IFBC) Besides the development in 'E' Block, the focus of development of activities has also moved to the adjoining 'G' Block where a new International Finance and Business Center is planned. =Objectives= The main objective of International Finance and Business Centre (IFBC) planning is to create new office locations. In order to ensure some life in the area even after offer office hours, a mix of activities has also been envisaged. =Accessibility= The basic consideration of the IFBC plan is accessibility to the area. The considerations of accessibility and orientation have shaped the overall master plan of IFBC. It is a part of the 'G' Block of Bandra Kurla Complex, which is located between Bandra and Kurla, both of which are major railway stations and have railway terminals (Bandra Terminus and Lokmanya Tilak Terminus, respectively) in their vicinity on the Western and Central lines respectively, of the Mumbai Suburban Railway. In addition to the suburban railway, the upcoming Line II of Phase 1 of the Mumbai Metro project will pass through the IFBC and will have 4 stations near and within BKC (i.e., MMRDA, Income Tax Office, Bharat Nagar and Complex Road), other than Bandra (Metro) and Kurla (Metro) stations. Other than the above rail links, BKC can also be accessed through the Western Express Highway, a major expressway in Mumbai, via the Kalanagar Junction and BKC Road, which passes through the IFBC. And also there is link road to connect Eastern express highway. =Land use= About 42 per cent of the land area of the plan is earmarked for commercial use and 14 per cent for housing. One of the important features of the area is preservation of large open spaces surrounding various public centers. This is expected to be the focal point of activities and a major attraction of the area. A large utility complex is proposed to be developed. It will provide space for various public and commercial utilities, small offices for professionals, car parks, bus stands and taxi stands. Parking demand expected in the area is about 15,000. To provide for such parking requirement, two level basement parking is permitted for all buildings. Public parking is also proposed in the form of multi-storied and underground garages. =Concert venues= In order to provide space in terms of open grounds for arranging various exhibitions, events etc., open plots have been made available on rent. These open plots collectively known as 'MMRDA Grounds' host most of the city's Trade Exhibitions, Music Concerts, Award Nights and Religious and Political Rallies. International Artists that have performed at the MMRDA grounds include Akon, 50 Cent, Beyonc√©, Guns N' Roses, INXS, Iron Maiden, Michael Learns to Rock, Pitbull, Roger Waters, Bryan Adams, Scorpions, Mark Knopfler and Shakira. BKC hosted Vodafone Speed Fest, an F1 Street Race featuring Lewis Hamilton on 16 September 2012.Speculations about my leaving McLaren are rubbish: Hamilton. The Hindu (2012-09-16).

Rahman, among others. =Development till date and in future= A number of offices and residential buildings and three schools have been constructed and occupied. Construction of other buildings is in an advanced stage of completion.

The first production of Lincrusta in the United States was in 1883 in Stamford, Connecticut. There were also factories built in 1880 at Pierrefitte, France, and by 1889 in Hannover, Germany. Lincrusta is now produced in Morecambe, Lancashire using traditional methods. Heritage Wallcoverings Ltd acquired the Lincrusta operating assets in July 2014.

Built during the reign of King Rajendravarman, it stands on what was an artificial island at the center of the now dry East Baray reservoir.Higham, C., 2001, The Civilization of Angkor, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, The East Mebon was dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva and honors the parents of the king. Its location reflects Khmer architects‚Äô concern with orientation and cardinal directions. The temple was built on a north‚Äìsouth axis with Rajendravarman's state temple, Pre Rup, located about 1,200 meters to the south just outside the baray. The East Mebon also lies on an east‚Äìwest axis with the palace temple Phimeanakas, another creation of Rajendravarman's reign, located about 6,800 meters due west. Built in the general style of Pre Rup, the East Mebon was dedicated in 953 AD. It has two enclosing walls and three tiers. It includes the full array of durable Khmer construction materials: sandstone, brick, laterite and stucco. At the top is a central tower on a square platform, surrounded by four smaller towers at the platform's corners. The towers are of brick; holes that formerly anchored stucco are visible. The sculpture at the East Mebon is varied and exceptional, including two-meter- high free-standing stone elephants at corners of the first and second tiers. Religious scenes include the god Indra atop his three-headed elephant Airavata, and Shiva on his mount, the sacred bull Nandi. Carving on lintels is particularly elegant. Visitors looking out from the upper level today are left to imagine the vast expanses of water that formerly surrounded the temple.

The appearance may be alarming, but it is a harmless condition. Predisposing factors include smoking, xerostomia (dry mouth), soft diet, poor oral hygiene and certain medications. Management is by improving oral hygiene, especially scraping or brushing the tongue. Signs and symptoms Hairy tongue largely occurs in the central part of the dorsal tongue, just anterior (in front) of the circumvallate papillae, although sometimes the entire dorsal surface may be involved. Discoloration usually accompanies hairy tongue, and may be yellow, brown or black. Apart from the appearance, the condition is typically asymptomatic, but sometimes people may experience a gagging sensation or a bad taste. There may also be associated oral malodor (intra-oral halitosis). The term \\"melanoglossia' is also used to refer to there being black discolorations on the tongue without \\"hairs\\", which are also harmless and unrelated to black hairy tongue. Causes The cause is uncertain, but it is thought to be caused by accumulation of epithelial squames and proliferation of chromogenic (i.e., color-producing) microorganisms. There may be an increase in keratin production or a decrease in normal desquamation (shedding of surface epithelial cells). Many people with BHT are heavy smokers. Other possible associated factors are poor oral hygiene, general debilitation, hyposalivation (i.e., decreased salivary flow rate), radiotherapy, overgrowth of fungal or bacterial organisms, and a soft diet. Occasionally, BHT may be caused by the use of antimicrobial medications (e.g., tetracyclines), or oxidizing mouthwashes or antacids. A soft diet may be involved as normally food has an abrasive action on the tongue, which keeps the filiform papillae short. Pellagra, a condition caused by niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency, may cause a thick greyish fur to develop on the dorsal tongue, along with other oral signs. Transient surface discoloration of the tongue and other soft tissues in the mouth can occur in the absence of hairy tongue. Causes include smoking (or betel chewing), some foods and beverages (e.g., coffee, tea or liquorice), and certain medications (e.g., chlorhexidine, iron salts, or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol)). Diagnosis Diagnosis is usually made on the clinical appearance without the need for a tissue biopsy. However, when biopsies have been taken, the histologic appearance is one of marked elongation and hyperparakeratosis of the filiform papillae and numerous bacteria growing on the epithelial surface. Hairy tongue may be confused with hairy leukoplakia, however the latter usually occurs on the sides of the tongue and is associated with an opportunistic infection with Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus on a background immunocompromise (almost always human immunodeficiency virus infection but rarely other conditions which suppress the immune system). =Classification= Hairy tongue (lingua villosa) refers to a marked accumulation of keratin on the filiform papillae on the dorsal surface of the tongue, giving a hair-like appearance. Black tongue (lingua nigra) refers to a black discoloration of the tongue, which may or may not be associated with hairy tongue. However, the elongated papillae of hairy tongue usually develop discoloration due to growth of pigment producing bacteria and staining from food. Hence the term black hairy tongue, although hairy tongue may also be discolored yellow or brown. Transient, surface discoloration that is not associated with hairy tongue can be brushed off. Drug-induced black hairy tongue specifically refers to BHT that develops because of medication. Treatment Treatment is by reassurance, as the condition is benign, and then by correction of any predisposing factors. This may be cessation of smoking or cessation/substitution of implicated medications or mouthwashes. Generally direct measures to return the tongue to its normal appearance involve improving oral hygiene, especially scraping or brushing the tongue before sleep. This promotes desquamation of the hyperparakeratotic papillae. Keratolytic agents (chemicals to remove keratin) such as podophyllin are successful, but carry safety concerns. Other reported successful measures include sodium bicarbonate mouthrinses, eating pineapple, sucking on a peach stone and chewing gum. Prognosis BHT is a benign condition, but people who are affected may be distressed at the appearance and possible halitosis, and therefore treatment is indicated. Epidemiology Hairy tongue occurs in about 0.5% of adults. However, the prevalence is variable depending on the population studied.

It is located in Angkor Thom, 400 m north-west of Phimeanakas. This small Buddhist sanctuary in the wooded area north of the Royal palace in Angkor Thom has a number of attractive features and is well worth the short detour.Ancient Angkor guide book by Michael Freeman and Claude Jacques, p.115, published in 2003. History The coexistence of Hindu and Buddhist elements and lacking of foundation stele or inscriptions make somewhat difficult dating this temple. It is generally ascribed to Jayavarman VIII reign, but it seems difficult to explain how the Buddhist imagery could have survived from the iconoclast fury of that epoch. Maybe it was built in different periods: the sanctuary in the first half of 12th century, while the gopura in the late 13th or early 14th century. Chinese art historian William Willetts (1918-1995) believed that it dated from the time of Suryavarman II (1113-1149).Willetts, William. An Angkor Roundabout. Unpublished manuscript, undated, soon to be published online by the Southeast Asian Ceramic Society (Singapore). The temple was cleaned by Henri Marchal in 1918-19, while the gopura was restored by anastylosis by Maurice Glaize in 1937-38.Glaize 1993, p.109 Description The temple has a cross-shaped terrace, 8.5 m by 30 m long, with seven-headed nƒÅga balustrades in good conditions, on the east, guarded by two decapitated dvarapalas and a lion (of an original two). A 33 m-long causeway connects it to the single sandstone gopura.Freeman, Jacques 2006, p.115 Before the laterite enclosure 50 m square there is a shrine with a 3 m tall statue of Buddha, sitting on a lotus, of a later period. The gopura has three entrances, the east-facing pediment of the northern one shows \\"the offering of the animals in the forest of Parilyyaka\\", where the Buddha retreated after leaving Kosambi. It seems that the origin of Pralilay could have been the alteration of the name Parilyyaka. Other pediments show other scenes from the life of the Buddha including Sujata's offering of rice-milk to the Buddha-to-be, and the subjugation of the elephant Nalagiri.Willetts The sandstone sanctuary stands on a three-tiered basement, 6 m high in overall. It has a 5 m square central chamber that opens to the four cardinal points with as many vestibules. Their classical ornamentations, unfortunately ruined, suggest that the sanctuary belongs to the first half of the 12th century and is older than the gopura. Even the characteristic \\"chimney-like\\" tower that stands above seems to be a later addition (Willetts identifying it as belonging to Jayavarman VII's period), maybe a frame for a covering. Some parts of the pediments have been taken away for safe-keeping, others are lying on the ground. The visible parts show Indra on his mount, the elephant Airavata, and the assault of the demoniac army of Mara.Freeman, Jacques 2006, p.116 At the present time there is a little Buddhist monastery near the temple and the presence of the monks in its area is not uncommon.

The band was a quartet, consisting of Jody Bleyle (drums and vocals), Pete Krebs (guitar and vocals), Brady Payne Smith (bass), and Fred Nemo (dancer). It lasted from 1992 to 1997.Hazel page from Sub Pop site History =Formation, style= The group was formed on February 14, 1992. Although based in the Pacific Northwest and active during the grunge movement in rock music, Hazel's music was different from most grunge in that it featured both male and female vocals as well as a more melodic sound that could be described as noise pop. Hazel's music was not particularly intricate musically, relying on a few chords, sheer energy (many songs being played at breakneck speed), and vocal intensity. Rather than singing together in harmony, Krebs and Bleyle often sang completely different parts that answered or intertwined with one another. The majority of lyrics dealt with problems regarding relationships, including the regret and resentment following a breakup (\\"Everybody's Best Friend\\") or the anxiety felt while attempting to begin a relationship (\\"Day Glo\\"). The group was also notable for featuring the dancer Fred Nemo as a full member. Often dressed in fanciful costumes, Nemo, a tall, bearded man, cavorted crazily about the stage, climbing atop speaker cabinets and swinging heavy objects through the air. =Albums= Cavity Search Records was founded as a small, independent record label in Portland, Oregon in 1992. The founders released the first single on the label, \\"JHell b/w Dayglo/Joe Louis Punchout\\" by Hazel, later in 1992. The group released two full-length albums, Toreador of Love and Are You Going to Eat That on the Sub Pop label. A 5-song EP on CandyAss/Caroline titled Airiana was their last release in 1997. Intermittently plagued by personality conflicts, Hazel formally broke up on February 13, 1997, following their last show in their hometown of Portland, Oregon, though they generally have played a couple of shows a year since then. =Post-dissolution= Member Jody Bleyle in 2005 As of 2005, Nemo performs with Tara Jane O'Neil and works as a bicycle activist in Portland. Krebs, also living in Portland, teaches guitar and performs with a wide assortment of ensembles. Bleyle, now based in Los Angeles, continues to perform around the United States, including reunion shows with girl punk band Team Dresch, a duo with her brother Allen called Family Outing, touring with Amy Ray of the Indigo Girls, and singing jazz standards in L.A. dives. Smith was the founding principal of Validus Preparatory Academy, a public high school in The Bronx, New York. He is currently living with his wife and kids in Abu Dhabi.

The primary participants were the U.S. 2nd Armored Division (Forward),1st Infantry Division (Mechanized), and the Iraqi 18th Mechanized and 9th Armoured Brigades of the Republican Guard Tawakalna Mechanized Infantry Division along with elements from eleven other Iraqi divisions.Bourque, p.144 The 2nd Armored Division(Fwd) was assigned to the American 1st Infantry Division as its 3rd maneuver brigade due to the fact that one of its brigades was not deployed.Dinackus P.4‚Äì10 The 2nd Armored Division(Fwd)'s Task Force 1-41 Infantry would be the spearhead of VII Corps. The British 1st Armoured division was responsible for protecting the right flank of VII Corps, their main adversary being the Iraqi 52nd Armored Division and multiple infantry divisions. It was the final battle of the war before the unilateral ceasefire took effect. One more battle occurred near the oil field at Rumaila after the ceasefire.VUA CitationConduct of the Persian Gulf War: final report to Congress p.339 The Battle of Norfolk has been recognized by some sources as the second largest tank battle in American history and the largest tank battle of the 1st Gulf War.http://www.wearethemighty.com/articles/6-massive-tank-battles-from-us- history No fewer than 12 divisions participated in the Battle of Norfolk along with multiple brigades and elements of a regiment.Bourque, p.377Bourque P.333, P.337Bourque, p.260 American and British forces destroyed approximately 850 Iraqi tanks and hundreds of other types of combat vehicles.Westwell, p. 88Bourque, p.275 This goes without even taking into consideration the destruction of two additional Republican Guard divisions at Objective Dorset by the U.S. 3rd Armored Division on 28 February 1991.VUA Citation During this battle the U.S. 3rd Armored Division destroyed 300 enemy vehicles and captured 2,500 Iraqi soldiers. Overview The battle took place about east of and 18 hours after the Battle of Al Busayyah, and several kilometers east of the Battle of 73 Easting, which had ended just two hours earlier. The Battle of Norfolk is named for Objective Norfolk, an area that encompassed the intersection of the IPSA Pipeline Road and several desert trails and a large Iraqi supply depot defended by Iraqi armor. Objective Norfolk was located west of Phase Line Kiwi, east of Phase Line Smash, and north of Phase Line Grape. Phase lines are map references occurring every few kilometers used to measure progress of an offensive operation.Bourque, p.134 Participants The primary forces involved in the battle were the American 1st Infantry Division, the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Armored Division (Fwd) ('Hell on Wheels') and the Iraqi 18th Mechanized and 9th Armoured Brigades of the Republican Guard Tawakalna Mechanized Infantry Division along with elements from eleven other Iraqi divisions including the Iraqi 26th, 48th, 31st, and 25th Infantry Divisions. The American 1st Infantry Division was quite formidable consisting of 334 M1A1 tanks and 224 M2A2 Bradley fighting vehicles.Bourque P.195 Task Force 1-41 Infantry of the U.S. 2nd Armored Division(Fwd) would spearhead the U.S. 1st Infantry Division and the rest of VII Corps throughout the war.VUA Citation The U.S. 1st Cavalry Division was also a participant.Bourque P.252 The Iraqi 52nd Armored Division was also a primary participant.Bourque, p.377 It was a powerful division consisting of 245 tanks and 195 armored fighting vehicles.Bourque P.185 The Iraqi 10th and 12th Armored Divisions were also present. The Iraqi 10th Armored Division was considered the best regular division in the Iraqi Army.Bourque P.243 It had more modern equipment than the other regular Iraqi units. It was equipped with T-72 and T-62 tanks. The Iraqis also had elements of two other independent armored brigades in theatre, those being the 50th and 29th Armored Brigades. The British fielded their 1st Armored Division.Bourque, p.260 The U.S. 3rd Armored Division handled responsibilities at Objective Dorset. Counter reconnaissance Task Force 1-41 Infantry was the first coalition force to breach the Saudi Arabian border on 15 February 1991 and conduct ground combat operations in Iraq engaging in direct and indirect fire fights with the enemy on 17 February 1991. Task Force 1-41 Infantry was a heavy battalion task force from the 2nd Armored Division (Forward). It consisted primarily of the 1st Battalion, 41st Infantry Regiment, 3rd Battalion, 66th Armor Regiment, and the 4th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery Regiment. Shortly after arrival in theatre Task Force 1-41 Infantry received a counter-reconnaissance mission along with the 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment.Hillman, p.6 This joint effort became known as Task Force Iron.Bourque & Burdan p.95 Counter-reconnaissance generally includes destroying or repelling the enemy's reconnaissance elements and denying their commander any observation of friendly forces. On 15 February 1991 4th Battalion of the 3rd Field Artillery Regiment fired on a trailer and a few trucks in the Iraqi sector that were observing American forces.Bourque, p.96 On 16 February 1991 several groups of Iraqi vehicles appeared to be performing reconnaissance on the Task Force and were driven away by fire from 4-3 FA.Bourque, p.98 Another enemy platoon, including six vehicles, was reported as being to the northeast of the Task Force. They were engaged with artillery fire from 4-3 FA.Bourque, p.99 Later that evening another group of Iraqi vehicles was spotted moving towards the center of the Task Force. They appeared to be Iraqi Soviet-made BTRs and tanks. For the next hour the Task Force fought several small battles with Iraqi reconnaissance units. TF 1-41 IN fired TOW missiles at the Iraqi formation destroying one tank. The rest of the formation was destroyed or driven away by artillery fire from 4-3 FA. On 17 February 1991 the Task Force took enemy mortar fire, however, the enemy forces managed to escape.Bourque, p. 102 Later that evening the Task Force received enemy artillery fire but suffered no casualties.Bourque, p.103 Soldiers of 2nd Platoon, Company C, 1st Battalion, 41st Infantry Regiment pose with a captured Iraqi tank during the 1st Gulf War, February 1991.

M270 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems attack Iraqi positions at the Battle of Norfolk during the 1st Gulf War, February 1991. Breach The breach was preceded by a heavy artillery barrage, led by VII Corps artillery units to soften up Iraqi defenses. Around 300 guns from multiple nations participated in the barrage. Over 14,000 rounds of artillery and over 4,900 MLRS rockets were fired at Iraqi forces during these raids. Iraq lost close to 22 artillery battalions during the initial stages of this barrage.Bourque P.161 This includes the destruction of approximately 396 Iraqi artillery pieces.Bourque P.161 By the end of these raids Iraqi artillery assets had all but ceased to exist. One Iraqi unit that was totally destroyed during the preparation was the Iraqi 48th Infantry Division Artillery Group.https://armyhistory.org/the- gulf-war-and-european-artillery/ The group's commander stated his unit lost 83 of its 100 guns to the artillery preparation. These raids were supplemented by air attacks by B-52 Stratofortress bombers and Lockheed AC-130 fixed wing gunships.Bourque pp.163 1st Infantry Division Apache helicopters and B-52 bombers conducted raids against Iraq's 110th Infantry Brigade.Bourque P.201 The 1st Engineer Battalion and 9th Engineer Battalion marked and proofed assault lanes under direct and indirect enemy fire to secure a foothold in enemy territory and pass the 1st Infantry Division and the British 1st Armored Division forward.Bourque P.156-157 1st Infantry Division Artillery made a significant contribution to the battle. They would fire 11,752 rounds of the 45,641 rounds fired during all artillery missions during the conflict. 1-5 FA would contribute 5,313 rounds. 4-5 FA contributed 4,100 rounds and 4-3 FA would fire 2,339 rounds during all artillery missions during the Gulf War.Lingamfelter p.191 These three battalions would be the most active of all 28 of the 155mm battalions present in theatre.Lingamfelter p.191 On 20 February 1991 4-3 FA along with 2-29 FA, C 1-17 FA(MLRS), A 1-158 FA(MLRS), and A 6-27 FA(MLRS) participated in a artillery raid against multiple Iraqi targets. This raid led to the destructions of multiple Iraqi artillery and armor units along with multiple command posts.Lingamfelter p.135 On 23 February 1991 4-3 FA along with 1-17 FA, 1-142 FA, 2-142 FA, and 1-27 FA participated in another successful artillery raid. This raid led to the destruction of additional Iraqi artillery assets, maneuver, command, and logistics targets.Lingamfelter p.135 On 24 February 1991 the 1st Cavalry Division conducted a couple artillery missions against Iraqi artillery units.Bourque P.206 One artillery mission struck a series of Iraqi bunkers, reinforced by Iraqi T-55 tanks, in the sector of the Iraqi 25th Infantry Division. The same day the 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division with the 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry, 1st Battalion, 32nd Armor, and the 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry destroyed Iraqi bunkers and combat vehicles in the sector of the Iraqi 25th Infantry Division. On 24 February 1991 2nd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division rolled through the breach in the Iraqi defense west of Wadi Al-Batin and also cleared the northeastern sector of the breach site of enemy resistance. Task Force 3-37th Armor breached the Iraqi defense clearing four passage lanes and expanding the gap under direct enemy fire. Also, on 24 February the American 1st Infantry Division along with the 1st Cavalry Division destroyed Iraqi outposts and patrols belonging to the Iraqi 26th Infantry Division.Bourque P.207 The two divisions also began capturing prisoners. The 1st Infantry Division also cleared a zone between Phase Line Vermont and Phase Line Kansas. Once the 1st Infantry Division's 3rd Battalion, 37th Armor reached the Iraqi rear defensive positions it destroyed an Iraqi D-30 artillery battery and many trucks and bunkers.Bourque P.225 Task Force 1-41 Infantry was given the task of breaching Iraq's initial defensive positions along the Iraq-Saudi Arabia border. The 1st Squadron, 4th Armored Cavalry Regiment handled similar responsibilities in its sector of operations. The 1st Infantry Division's 5th Battalion, 16th Infantry also played a significant role clearing the trenches and captured 160 Iraqi soldiers in the process. Once into Iraqi territory Task Force 1-41 Infantry encountered multiple Iraqi defensive positions and bunkers. These defensive positions were occupied by a brigade-sized element.Desert Storm/Shield Valorous Unit Award Citations Task Force 1-41 Infantry elements dismounted and prepared to engage the enemy soldiers which occupied these well-prepared and heavily fortified bunkers. The Task Force found itself engaged in six hours of combat in order to clear the extensive bunker complex. The Iraqis engaged the Task Force with small arms fire, RPGs, mortar fire, and what was left of Iraqi artillery assets. A series of battles unfolded which resulted in heavy Iraqi casualties and the Iraqis being removed from their defensive positions with many becoming prisoners of war. Some escaped to be killed or captured by other coalition forces.Bourque, pp.113-133 In the process of clearing the bunkers Task Force 1-41 captured two brigade command posts and the command post of the Iraqi 26th Infantry Division.Bourque P.259 The Task Force also captured a brigade commander, several battalion commanders, company commanders, and staff officers. As combat operations progressed Task Force 1-41 Infantry engaged at short range multiple dug in enemy tanks in ambush positions.

The Iraqi tank unit was destroyed by a Task Force 1-41 tank platoon that was assigned to protect 4-3 FA. A reconnaissance party from 4-3 FA mistakenly moved well forward of the other Task Force 1-41 Infantry units. Task Force 3-66 Armor was given the assignment of looking for the lost reconnaissance party. As Task Force 3-66 Armor approached the reconnaissance party, enemy infantry foolishly took it under fire from fighting positions near the disoriented 4-3 FA recon party. TF 3-66 M1A1 Abrams tanks and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles fought back with only machine guns rather than cannons to reduce the danger of hitting TF 1-41 IN, which stood just beyond the enemy. TF 3-66 AR machine gun fire drove the enemy right into TF 1-41 IN with Hillman's troops capturing all of the enemy soldiers. TF 3-66 AR recovered the members of the lost reconnaissance party unharmed.Fontenot P.294 The 1st Engineer Battalion was a key participant in the subsequent destruction of one and the rout of two Iraqi Republican Guard Divisions.

All three disciplines had both individual and team competitions. The equestrian competitions were held at 3 sites: an existing equestrian facility at Riem for the individual show jumping and eventing competitions, the Olympic Stadium in Munich for the Nations Cup, and Nymphenburg, a Baroque palace garden, for the sold-out dressage. 179 entries, including 31 women, competed from 27 countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Bulgaria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark, German Democratic Republic (GDR), France, Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), Great Britain, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Soviet Union, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the USA. The youngest participant was Kurt Maeder from Switzerland at 19 years old, while the oldest rider was Lorna Johnstone from Great Britain at 70 years old. An outbreak of Venezuelan equine encephalitis broke out in Mexico before the Games, so the Mexican horses were not permitted into the host country. The IOC and FEI agreed to allow the Mexicans to lease horses in Germany for the show jumping and eventing competitions so that they may still compete. While this allowed the riders to attend the Olympics, the Mexicans had dismal results, including all four of the eventers being eliminated on cross-country. The disciplines =Show jumping= 74 riders from a total of 21 countries contested Hans-Heinrish Brinckmann's Olympic courses. The individual competition was held over two rounds. The course of the first round consisted of 14 obstacles and 17 jumping efforts over a 760-meter track, with several difficult individual fences. This included a 5-meter water, which produced 33 faults in the first round, and several massive oxers (four at 2 meters wide and a fifth at 2.10 meters) which all combined produced another 20 faults. Only 3 riders were able to produce a clear round, and 8 finished with only a knockdown. The second round was a 660-meter track with 10 obstacles and 13 jumping efforts. One rider who went clear in the first round was not in contention after the second. The two other clear rounds from the first course‚ÄîGraziano Mancinelli and Ann Moore‚Äîhad 2 rails apiece in the second for 8 faults. Neal Shapiro, one of the eight 4-faulters in round 1, finished the second round with only one rail so also finished both rounds with 8 faults. Therefore, a jump-off between the 3 riders decided who was to take home gold, silver, and bronze. Mancinelli managed a clear for the gold, followed by Moore who had three faults for silver, and then Shapiro who had two knock downs.Equestrianism at the 1972 M√ºnchen Summer Games: Mixed Jumping, Individual. sports-reference.com The Nations Cup was held in the Olympic Stadium, so horses were shipped out of Riem at 3:15 am to tent stabling nearby. Unlike the gold and silver medal winners, Shapiro managed another great performance for his team, finishing with 8.25 faults in round 1 and no faults in the second round, helping the USA finish with team silver. =Dressage= The 1972 Olympics saw great changes for dressage. First, the individual medals were only awarded based on the results of the ride-off, with the Grand Prix serving as a qualifying round for the ride-off, whereas before the scores from the Grand Prix and ride-off were added together to determine the winner. The judging also changed drastically. 5 judges, instead of three, were on the panel, and two of the five were (for the first time) placed on the long side rather than having the entire panel sitting on the short side at C. Unlike recent decades where, due to accusations of unfair judging, judges were to be from non-competing countries, the 1972 Games allowed judges to be selected from countries competing in the Games and therefore to judge their own countrymen. The scores of all five judges were to count into the final score, rather than dropping the highest and lowest produced by the panel. Unfortunately this change in judging did not eliminate all problems. When the horse of French rider Patrick Le Rolland was lame during his test, Gustaf Nybl√¶us (the judge at C) did not ring him out. Additionally, while four of the judges deducted points for the lameness to put him somewhere between 20th to 29th place, the inexperienced Mexican judge had him finishing in 7th place. More than 30 riders from 13 countries, who made up 10 full teams and a few individuals, competed at the Nymphenburg site. Despite this being the first time it was used for a competition, the palace garden proved to be a great success. However, there was a good deal of work performed to prepare it, including adding additional footing (80 cm of gravel, followed by 4 cm of cinder and clay, then 6 cm of a sand/wood shaving mix) to the already existing gravel of the park. Liselotte Linsenhoff won gold on Piaffe, making her the first woman to win individual gold in the equestrian events.Equestrianism at the 1972 M√ºnchen Summer Games: Mixed Dressage, Individual. sports- reference.com Dressage again showed the great age range possible in Olympic mounts, with 3 horses (Sod, Casanova, and San Fernando) at 17 years of age, and 1 horse (Granat) competing at age 7‚Äîwho would return at the following Olympics at age 11 and win gold. 12 of the 33 mounts competing were 14 or older. =Eventing= A crowd of 60,000 spectators watched 73 riders from 19 nations competing on endurance day. The Roads and Tracks phases (Phase A and C) were held on flat ground. The cross-country test, designed by Ottokar Pohlmann, saw quite a few problems. Four fences in particular proved the most troublesome‚Äîproducing a total of 38 refusals, 18 falls, and 7 eliminations‚Äîincluded a fence into the water (obstacle 12), a drop fence in a combination (obstacle 17a), a palisade up a hill (obstacle 18), and a ditch (obstacle 23). The German team, despite the elimination of one of their top rider, Horst Karsten and Sioux, still managed to finish with a bronze medal, behind Great Britain (gold) and the USA (silver). The gold-winning British team included 2 women, with a third woman competing on the Canadian team. 48 of the 73 horses completed the competition, including a 5-year-old on the Argentinean team who finished next to last. 29 of the finishing horses were 8 years old or younger.Equestrianism at the 1972 M√ºnchen Summer Games: Mixed Three-Day Event, Team. sports-reference.com Medal summary { -valign=\\"top\\" Individual dressage    -valign=\\"top\\" Team dressage  Yelena Petushkova and Pepel Ivan Kizimov and Ikhor Ivan Kalita and Tarif  Karin Schl√ºter and Liostro Liselott Linsenhoff and Piaff Josef Neckermann and Venetia  Ulla H√•kansson and Ajax Ninna Swaab and Casanova Maud von Rosen and Lucky Boy -valign=\\"top\\" Individual eventing    -valign=\\"top\\" Team eventing  Richard Meade and Laurieston Mary Gordon-Watson and Cornishman V Bridget Parker and Cornish Gold Mark Phillips and Great Ovation  Kevin Freeman and Good Mixture Bruce Davidson and Plain Sailing Michael Plumb and Free and Easy James C.

The company's flagship store is in Burlington, Vermont. The company was privately owned by Burton and his wife, Donna Carpenter, who has been active in the business since 1983. Company overview Burton factory in 2009, including double chairlift, originally used at a resort,burton.kontain.com between streetlightsBurton built the world's first snowboard factory. It is the largest snowboard brand in the world. The first snowboard was a BB1 snowboard, which is a narrow board with single strap bindings and a rope and handle attached to the nose. Burton products are marketed worldwide in over 4,348 stores; 1,536 of those stores are located in the United States. In 2003 Burton allowed several online companies to sell Burton products over the internet. For years Burton had only been available through stores locally, but Burton felt that an online presence would allow buyers to have an alternative instead of turning to another brand. As well as selling Burton products, Burton stores sell several sub-brands which focus on specific market niches. These sub- brands include Anon Optics (snowboard goggles and eyewear), RED (helmets and body armor), Analog (outerwear) and Gravis (footwear, now defunct). In 2005, Four Star Distribution sold four of its snowboard brands to Burton: Forum Snowboarding, Jeenyus, Foursquare, and Special Blend. Burton, a privately owned company, also owns a surfing distributor. The Burton line is split into Four types of categories. They are: Freeride, for big mountain; freestyle, for versatile ride; park, for freestyle disciplines like half-pipe and park, and Carving; for carving down the side of mountains. Each of the categories has different levels of performance and price. In 2009, Burton's line included 61 snowboards in men, women, and youth. Board prices range from $300 to $1,500. In February 2008, Burton acquired DNA Distribution, which includes the skateboard manufacturer Alien Workshop, and two other companies.Burton :: Burton Acquires Alien Workshop and Habitat In 2008, the snowboard equipment industry had grown to $487 million. Burton had 40‚Äì70% of these sales, depending on the category. Average age of employees was 30 in 2008. History Top view of a c. 1981 Burton snowboard in museum condition Burton Snowboards was founded by Jake Burton in 1977. Burton was inspired by the snurfer, invented by Sherman Poppen. He modified it. In 1977, Burton moved to Londonderry, Vermont to make the first Burton Snowboards. Burton personally first made snowboards by hand in his garage. He couldn't afford the proper equipment‚Äîso he applied polyurethane wearing a scuba mask. His co-founder Dimitrije Milovich, was an East coast surfer and founder of Winterstick. In 1978, they moved to Manchester, Vermont. During the early years four or five workers sold, shaped, and repaired their snowboards. Jake Burton campaigned for local resorts to open their lifts to snowboard riders. The first mountain to have reportedly let snowboarders in was in 1982, the Suicide Six ski area in Pomfret, Vermont. Next was Stratton Mountain, and later, Jay Peak and Stowe. When resorts started to accept riders, the public did too. Burton was in place to supply them with snowboards. In 1982, Burton was marketing their product at the National Snowboarding Championships, which were held at Suicide Six. In 1985, the National Snowboarding Championships moved to Stratton Mountain and became the U.S. Open Snowboarding championships which was operated and owned by Burton. This competition helped legitimize the sport. In 1983, he married Donna Carpenter and, in the past, taken her last name as his last name. In 1985 Burton established the European Division of Burton in Innsbruck, Austria. In 1986, distribution started in New Zealand. In 1992, the Burton factory relocated to Burlington. In 1994, they opened the Japan division in Urawa-shi. In 2014, there were 400 employees in Burlington, out of 1,000 worldwide. As of 2009, Burton owned 10 companies that sold snowboards, outerwear, and shoes. R.E.D, Gravis, Anon, Analog, Forum, Special Blend, Foursquare, Jeenyus, and most recently Channel Islands. In 2008, Burton began to make surfboards in Vermont. In 2008, a number of complaints arose when Burton produced snowboards, some with topsheets illustrating self-mutilation and others with topsheets illustrating Playboy bunnies. As a result, the Burton Love was discontinued for the 2012 line and replaced by the Mr. Nice Guy. Each year, Jake Burton has hosted the Fall Bash, to promote good will among employees and friends of the company. In 2009, the Fall Bash became the subject of controversy after the company attempted to censor press about it. In 2010, Burton announced that Burton Snowboards would cease manufacturing in Vermont, moving production to Austria. \\"[S]imply put, it costs us significantly more to produce a board in Vermont than we are capable of selling it for, and sadly, this is not sustainable in the current economy.\\" Burton named Donna Carpenter as President in December 2011. For 2013, Donna Carpenter estimated that the company had 40‚Äì45% of the snowboarding business; which business totaled $236 million. She said that the U.S. market comprised 35% of the business, Europe 30%, and Japan and Canada most of the rest. In May 2014, Burton named Mike Rees as CEO. Jake Burton remained as founder and chairman. In December 2015, Burton named Donna Carpenter as CEO (Mike Rees having left to be closer to family) and John Lacy as President. In light of their 40th anniversary in 2016, Burton's Chief Creative Officer, Greg Dacyshyn, stated he wishes to keep both the sport and lifestyle aspect of the brand going for many years. Jake Burton Carpenter died at his home due to a recurrence of testicular cancer on November 20, 2019. Marketing and promotion In order to attract rider interest, Burton sponsors professional riders and events. Burton's sponsored professional snowboard team includes Taylor Gold, Shaun White, Jeremy Jones, Kazuhiro Kokubo, Terje Haakonsen, Ellery Hollingsworth, Kelly Clark, Hannah Teter, and Kevin Pearce. Burton has avoided having complete sponsorship with Burton/Burton affiliated brands. Nicholas Mueller rides Burton bindings/boards with Nike boots/outerwear. Burton has come under criticism over its choices regarding team members, such as the removal of David Carrier Porcheron and other riders in 2008. Burton sponsored the creation of organic terrain parks made of rocks, stumps, and logs. These parks, known as \\"The Stash\\" can be found at Northstar, California, Truckee, California, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Killington Ski Resort, Vermont, Avoriaz, France, and The Remarkables, New Zealand. Burton Snowboards created a program Learn To Ride in 1998. They were the only snowboard company to focus on instruction methods and beginner-specific equipment. The goal was to give beginner snowboarders the best initial snowboarding experience possible so they would continue to snowboard. Burton teamed up with the American Association of Snowboard Instructors, the Canadian Association of Snowboard Instructors, and major resorts around the world. The Chill program was founded in 1995 to provide children with the opportunity to learn to snowboard. Chills works in conjunction with inner city youth programs to take children and teens to local mountains and teach them to ride over a six-week period. Burton provides everything needed for the experience: gear, lift tickets, and instruction. Founded in 1995, Chill has provided over 12,000 underprivileged children the opportunity to learn to snowboard. Because of the 2008 graphics controversy and concern over effects on youth, a local beneficiary severed its ties with Burton. In December 2016, Burton launched a pop up shop on Newbury Street in Boston. Technology The company started using a single-channel binding-mounting system on its 2008 models. In 2009, this system was installed on other snowboard lines. A binding system was offered with this system that was designed to give the rider more control as well as greater board feel. This binding system named EST eliminates weight by mounting the binding to the board from the sides of the binding instead of the middle, getting rid of the middle baseplate. One is also able to move the binding in another direction from before, back and forward. The binding is able to adjust to ones specific needs.

The concept is studied in the field of evolutionary psychology.  Basis  Evolutionary psychologists have suggested that there is a gender difference in sexual jealousy, driven by men and women's different reproductive biology. A man perceives a threat to his relationship's future because he could be cuckolded into raising children that are not his own. In contrast, a woman risks losing to another the relationship and all the benefits that entails. Research has shown that men are impacted more by sexual infidelity, while women are more impacted by emotional infidelity. An alternative explanation is from a social-cognitive perspective. Typically, men place importance on their masculinity and sexual dominance. When the male's partner commits sexual infidelity, these two components of his ego become severely threatened. Women are more emotionally invested in a relationship, and therefore experience a threat to their self-perception when a partner commits infidelity, more concerned with risk to the emotional content than the sexual. Some research has suggested that there are no gender differences in sexual jealousy, concluding that males and females both equally experience distress over emotional and sexual infidelity. Sexual jealousy is cross-culturally universal but how it manifests itself may differ across cultures. Gender-specific behaviors =Female= Are You Jealous? by Paul Gauguin. Based on a real-life episode during Gauguin's stay on Tahiti, the painting shows two Tahitian women. Psychologists have found that males react very strongly to sexual infidelity, whereas females are more likely to forgive a one-time sexual adventure if it does not threaten the male parental investment. Therefore, jealousy is likely to be evoked in females if they feel that their partner may leave them for another woman; this has been shown to be more likely to occur if the male commits emotional infidelity. Emotional infidelity occurs when one partner develops a meaningful, emotional attachment with someone outside of their primary romantic relationship.  Emotional jealousy  Many studies have shown that females tend to place a stronger emphasis on the emotional aspect of infidelity over the sexual aspect; it is this emotional infidelity that becomes the focus of female sexual jealousy. The most direct evidence for female's focus on emotional jealousy comes from Buss et al. (1992) who presented participants with scenarios in which they were asked to choose between a partner's sexual unfaithfulness and a partner's emotional unfaithfulness as the most distressing event. They found that more females than males reported a partner's emotional infidelity as the most distressing event. As well as using self-report measures, the researchers measured the participants' physiological responses (heart rate and electrodermal activity) to the scenarios; women were also found to be more physiologically upset to the idea of their partners committing emotional infidelity. =Male= Male sexual jealousy functions to defend paternity confidence, and is likely to have evolved through natural selection to prevent cuckoldry ‚Äî a threat to males since they risk expending resources to support the biological offspring of others. The male reaction stereotypically manifests as the emotion of jealousy, using or threatening violence to protect sexual exclusivity, and thus the inclination to control women. This idea of males ensuring sexual exclusivity has also led to laws on adultery. From an evolutionary perspective, the jealousy arises from this threat of investing in non-biologically related offspring and thus is most strongly felt over their mate's sexual infidelity than their emotional infidelity.It can take several forms in behaviour: aggression and violence, and possessiveness or controlling behaviour towards their mate. In some cases, sexual jealousy can lead to uxoricide. Threats to a relationship can arise from other sources too, such as the presence of rivals, cues to infidelity, and partner dissatisfaction with the relationship. Morbid jealousy is also concurrent with male sexual jealousy ‚Äì an obsession with thoughts of a partner's suspected sexual infidelity. A 2012 meta-analysis reviewed the literature and found that sexual jealousy in males can also lead to emotions such as distress, hurt and disgust being experienced.  Expression  = Expression in females =  Aggression  While most empirical research suggests that males are more likely to act aggressively in response to sexual jealousy, some studies have shown that females may also display aggression and violence. Women have been found to report that their hypothetical sexual jealousy would manifest itself as anger and physical aggression towards the man. It has been suggested that this is because women are more empathetic towards the \\"victim\\", triggering strong aggression towards the unfaithful man. However, it is not known if these hypothetical reports would become actions in real life situations. Furthermore, statistics on domestic violence continue to show that in relationships it is primarily men who are the abusers, rather than the women. On the other hand, it has been suggested that because it is the woman that ultimately chooses the mate, aggression caused by infidelity is directed at the rival female. As a result, when a woman is around a suspected rival female, she is more likely than a male counterpart to announce that her companion is \\"taken\\", and go out of her way to enhance her appearance to her spouse.  Self-blame  Following infidelity, women are more likely to focus their sexual jealousy on their own relationship and self-blame. Women are also more likely to experience symptoms of depression following the infidelity. Evidence for the interpretation that in jealousy situations women focus more on their own functioning as a partner comes from research by Dijkstra and Buunk (2002). This research suggests that unlike men's jealousy, women's jealousy stems more from comparing their own qualities with those of the rival. That is, the higher the level of social comparison, a personality characteristic referring to the tendency to compare one's characteristics with those of others, the more jealousy various rival characteristics evoked. = Expression in males =  Mate guarding behaviour  One behaviour arising from male's sexual jealousy towards their partner's sexual infidelity is mate guarding. These tactics are used to prevent partner infidelity and thus may be used when there are perceived threats in the environment. It results in several behaviours, and researchers have documented up to 19 different tactics used. This includes (but is not exclusive to): * Violence (or at least hostility) directed towards competitors, * Taking up all of the mate's time so that they have no time to meet other potential mates, * Emotionally manipulating their mate, * Increase their possession signals with jewelry, clothing, cars, etc., * Enhancing their appearance (e.g. fixing their hair, clothing, etc.). = Attachment style = According to attachment theory, the quality of a child's interactions with caregivers during times of need shape their future interactions; this includes later relationships. Research has shown that insecure-avoidant individuals tend to report more sexual jealousy than those who are securely attached. This may be due to the fact that, in comparison to securely attached individuals, those who are insecurely attached tend to experience lower levels of trust, intimacy and stability in their romantic relationships. Evidence suggests that people who experience low self-esteem are much more afraid that their partner is dissatisfied and being unfaithful, which again increases the likelihood that they will experience sexual jealousy. = Sex drive = Sex drive, also known as libido, is the physiological need for sexual activity. Sex drive has been found to be a significant predictor of higher sexual jealousy in both men and women; those who had a higher sex drive showed greater distress at the idea of their partner committing sexual infidelity. This is consistent with other empirical research that has shown that individuals who value sexual gratification highly were more likely to be distressed by sexual infidelity. To explain this finding, researchers have suggested the key threat that sexual infidelity poses for individuals with a high sex drive is loss of access to sexual gratification, as their partner is granting sexual access to a third person. = Relationship quality = Research has shown that individuals who reported high jealousy scores had more stable and successful relationships than individuals who reported comparatively low jealousy scores. Furthermore, individuals in committed relationships tend to experience higher levels of jealousy than individuals in less committed relationships. To explain this, researchers have proposed that those in better quality, more committed relationships would have more to lose if their partner were to leave them for someone else, and therefore worry more about infidelity. Therefore, such individuals experience greater sexual jealousy if they feel the relationship is threatened.  Explanations  Researchers have proposed a number of theories to explain sexual jealousy in both males and females. In addition, some of these explanations can be used to explain the sex differences in sexual jealousy and why there may be differences in the degree to which people experience jealousy. = Evolutionary psychology perspective = Evolutionary psychologists propose that the core function of sexual jealousy is to retain access to a valuable mate. This explanation is known as jealousy as a specific innate module, \\"JSIM\\". According to this perspective, sexual jealousy should be activated by threats to the relationship; in particular, threats of sexual infidelity by the female and threats that the male may share his resources (money, protection, time) with another woman. For males, their biggest concern when they commit to a relationship is ensuring that any offspring produced is biologically theirs, therefore, sexual infidelity is a huge threat to them as there is then a chance that they are not the genetic parent. If a male raises a child that is not genetically his own, he has effectively wasted his resources raising another man's child who will not pass on any of his genes. As women have genetic certainty when they bear a child, this is not a concern to them. However, women do face a different evolutionary problem. If her partner becomes emotionally attached to another woman, there is a real chance that the male may share his resources with the other woman or leave their current relationship altogether. Either way, the female loses some of the male parental investment; and the loss of her mate's resources may significantly reduce the survival of herself and her offspring. The evolutionary psychology perspective has been supported by a study conducted by David Buss. He observed that male sexual jealousy is triggered by sexual infidelity, whereas female sexual jealousy is triggered by emotional infidelity. The study concluded that sexual jealousy may be an adaptive function that is triggered in order to retain access to a valuable mate. Researchers David Buss and Todd Shackleford propose and test several hypotheses about sexual jealousy: # Men will devote more resources to mate retention when their partner is younger than them than men whose partner is older than them. This hypothesis rests on the evolutionary principle of mate value. Younger women are likely to have more mate value because they are more fertile. Therefore, it is predicted that men are likely to engage in mate retention behaviours more often when their partner is younger rather than older than them. # Again based on the principle of mate value is the prediction that men will devote more resources to mate retention when their partner is perceived to be more physically attractive than when their partner is perceived to be less physically attractive. Females who are physically attractive have a higher mate value than those who are less physically attractive. # Women will allocate more resources to mate retention when their partner has a wealth of resources than women whose partners have few resources. This hypothesis also rests on the mate value principle. Men who have more resources and wealth have a higher mate value than those who do not. # If a man perceives his partner as having a higher mate value than him, then he is more likely to engage in efforts towards mate retention than men who perceive their partners as having a lower or equal mate value than them. This hypothesis rests on perceived mate value. If a male's partner has a higher mate value than him, she is more likely to be able to attract other men who may be of a similar mate value to her. As such, the male is at a greater risk of losing her to another man with a higher mate value. # Individuals who suspect their partners are being unfaithful are more likely to devote effort towards mate retention than those who do not suspect their partners are being unfaithful. This hypothesis relies on the perceived probability of infidelity. Men risk being cuckolded into raising children that are not genetically theirs, and women risk losing their mate's resources and time. Their research provided evidence to support all above hypotheses except for hypothesis 5; this effect was unique to men only. This suggests that a woman who suspects her male partner of being unfaithful is not necessarily more likely to devote more effort to retaining them: > One could speculate that a partner's sexual infidelity signals less of a > loss for women than for men given the reproductive logic of paternity > uncertainty, but this explanation does not square with the findings that > women become just as upset as men by a partner's infidelity, particularly > when it represents a serious, emotionally involved relationship (Buss et > al., 1992). = The double-shot hypothesis = This hypothesis contradicts the evolutionary perspective. It proposes that these gender differences in feelings of sexual jealousy stem from beliefs as opposed to being evolved traits. The double-shot hypothesis (also known as the two-for-one hypothesis) suggests that women have a belief that men can have sexual relations without emotionally committing themselves. Women also believe that for men to have emotional commitment, sex is a prerequisite. Therefore, if men and women place importance on different aspects of relationship, this explains why they may also be upset by different types of sexual jealousy differently. = Social- cognitive perspective = As both forms of jealousy are threatening to both men and women, the social-cognitive perspective suggests that there are no inherent, evolutionarily induced gender differences. Instead, both emotional and sexual jealousy are believed to occur when an individual believes that a rival is posing a threat to what one perceives to be a valuable interpersonal relationship. When the relationship or one's self-esteem is threatened, jealousy is evoked. The perspective also provides explanations as to why men would be more upset by sexual infidelity than women. Men are socialized to be masculine, which includes having great sexual prowess. If a man's partner commits sexual infidelity, this brings into question his sexual prowess and therefore threatens his masculinity. This results a strong, negative reaction in response to the sexual infidelity, which does not tend to occur in response to emotional infidelity. In contrast, women are taught to be emotional nurturers in a relationship, therefore, if their partner commits emotional infidelity, this may threaten her sense of self more than if her partner commits sexual infidelity. The social-cognitive perspective also proposes the transactional model of jealousy, which can be used to explain why there may be differences in the degree to which individuals experience sexual jealousy within genders, as well as between genders. This model examines how three variables ‚Äì (1) arousability, (2) commitment and, (3) insecurity ‚Äì moderate jealousy. # Individual differences in sexual jealousy are determined by the difference in levels of physiological arousal: individuals who are easily aroused have more intense jealous reactions than those with lower physiological arousal # Commitment refers to the degree of dedication a person has in the relationship: the more committed a person is to a relationship, the greater the threat of loss, which leads to greater feelings of jealousy # Insecurity refers to the perceived level of commitment of the partner: if we perceive our partner to be un-involved or disinterested in the relationship, we feel more insecure. The degree to which these factors are experienced together determine the intensity of sexual jealousy felt by an individual.  Culture  Sexual jealousy is cross-culturally universal and affects both men and women. However, the extent of sexual jealousy varies across cultures. Sexual jealousy is strongly mediated by culture in both heterosexual and homosexual couples, and in males is said to be prevalent in patriarchal cultures (in which heritability runs through the male side). = Evocation = There are cross-cultural differences in behaviours that evoke sexual jealousy. Specifically, one study focused on seven different countries: Hungary, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Yugoslavia. Different behaviours were found to elicit different extents of sexual jealousy. For instance, flirting, kissing and sexual involvement elicit sexual jealousy across all these nations. However, dancing, hugging and kissing evoke very different reactions across cultures. In the Soviet Union, the most sexual jealousy is seen across dancing, hugging, flirting and kissing behaviours. Yugoslavian participants display the most intense sexual jealousy to flirting behaviour but the least to kissing. Dutch participants show the least sexual jealousy to kissing, dancing and hugging behaviours. = In Western cultures = Societies that permit extra-marital sexual relations often discourage sexual jealousy. For example, in Denmark very low sexual jealousy rates are determined by the very low 10% disapproval of extra-marital sex. On the other hand, individuals in the American Midwest show high feelings of sexual jealousy which corresponds to the 90% disapproval of extra-marital sex. American men also feel more sexual jealousy compared to German men when asked which would cause them more distress: i) a partner having formed a strong emotional attachment with another person or ii) a partner having passionate sexual intercourse with another person. Scenario i) measured emotional jealousy and scenario ii) measured sexual jealousy. The American men reported 33% greater sexual and emotional jealousy compared to German men. Greater sexual jealousy seen in American men may be because in American culture, love, sex, family relationships and marriage are strongly connected. So when partners entangle with others, loss of love and relationship and therefore sexual jealousy, are all likely to be felt. Additionally, in Western culture, females are more likely than men to trigger sexual jealousy. Inducing sexual jealousy is to increase their partner's attention towards them and counteract sexual and emotional jealousy. However, Western culture now is mainly monogamous which is very different from the environments in which the majority of evolution thus far has occurred. Therefore, evolutionarily it is likely that different past cultures also showed differences in sexual jealousy. = In Asian (\\"Eastern\\") cultures = Cross-cultural comparisons between China and United States reveal that, regardless of nation, men show greater sexual jealousy than women. Females show significantly higher levels of emotional jealousy. In contrast, between the nations, both men and women from the United States show greater sexual jealousy than Chinese individuals. In contemporary India, sexual jealousy is a primary cause of violence towards women compared to other causes. In an Indian sample, approximately fifty-one per cent of the violence towards women was due to sexual jealousy. In history, between 1880 and 1925, there was a large number of suicides amongst Indian immigrants on plantations in Fiji that reports attributed to sexual jealousy. Sexual jealousy was high amongst these immigrants due to the disproportionate ratio of sexes: a high number of men to a low number of women. In suicide reports, sexual jealousy was described as a \\"racial trait\\" belonging to Indian men and was evoked when European men slept with Indian women during an era of European colonization of India. However, to repeat from above, sexual jealousy is cross-culturally universal and affects both men and women  Explanations for cross-cultural differences  = Evolutionary psychology model = The differences in feelings of jealousy across cultures support the evolutionary psychological model. Different weights are given to triggers of sexual jealousy depending on the culture. In liberal cultures, male mating effort is based on the number of women the male has copulated with. These men therefore invest less time in each woman and thus exhibit less sexual jealousy. = Paternity certainty = Paternity certainty is the extent to which a male knows or believes that a woman's child is his. In polygamous societies, men feel greater sexual jealousy when there is low paternity certainty. This is because they don't want to risk wasting time, energy and resources on a child that is not theirs. Socio-economic differences between cultures also affect paternity certainty. In a \\"natural fertility\\" country such as Namibia, 96% of males show sexual jealousy. Additionally, there is greater likelihood of paternity loss and paternity uncertainty when there is a lack of contraceptives. This provides an explanation for why industrialised countries tend to show lower sexual jealousy compared to pre-industrialised countries.

It is approximately 350 acres. The park is approximately six miles to the west of the city center of New Orleans and sits on land that was purchased by the city in 1871. It is bordered on one side by the Mississippi River and on the other by St. Charles Avenue, directly across from Loyola University and Tulane University. The park is named in honor of artist and naturalist John James Audubon, who began living in New Orleans in 1821. History and features One of the fountains at Audubon Park with Tulane University in the background. The land now housing the park was a plantation in the colonial and early statehood days. It was used by both the Confederate and the Union armies in the American Civil War, and as a staging area for the Buffalo Soldiers. At the time of its establishment it was the last large undeveloped parcel of what was to become uptown New Orleans. The area was annexed by the City of New Orleans, along with the surrounding communities of Jefferson City and Greenville in 1870, and the following year the city purchased the land. Use as an urban park was intended from the start, with \\"Upper City Park\\" originally selected as a name to distinguish the park from City Park, but few improvements occurred in the first decade. The nascent park accommodated a World's Fair soon thereafter, the World Cotton Centennial of 1884. After the closing of the fair, the park's development began in earnest. Most of the fair's buildings were demolished, with the exception of Horticultural Hall - which remained in the park until destroyed in the 1915 New Orleans hurricane. The only notable reminder of the fair to remain in the park in the 21st century is a large iron ore rock from the Alabama State exhibit (which in local lore has often been misidentified as a meteorite). Audubon Park's present form largely follows a design drafted by John Charles Olmsted, a principal of the renowned Olmsted Brothers landscape architecture practice. Early in the 20th century, part of the park became home to the Audubon Zoo. The zoo received significant improvement at the hands of the Works Progress Administration, and again from the 1970s onwards. Numerous early- and mid-20th century park attractions like the miniature railway, the enormous Whitney Young public swimming pool, the swan boats in the lagoons, and the carousel were closed, dismantled and/or discontinued in the 1970s, though a far smaller public pool was constructed in the 1990s adjacent to the site of the original Young pool. The park features sports fields and picnic facilities along the Mississippi River, in an area called Riverview Park. This riverside portion of Audubon Park is known colloquially as \\"The Fly\\", an almost-forgotten reference to the modernist, butterfly-shaped river viewing shelter constructed in the 1960s and demolished in the 1980s in the aftermath of its severe damage one foggy morning at the hands of blundering river traffic. The ring road around the park was closed to automobile traffic at the start of the 1980s and became a popular walking, jogging and biking route. A 2.2 mile dirt path located around the perimeter of the park is also popular for runners seeking a less congested route. A few of the park's old live oak trees were blown down when Hurricane Katrina hit the city in 2005, but as the park is wholly located on high ground comprising the Mississippi River's natural levee, it was spared the flooding experienced by the majority of the city after Katrina. Audubon Park was used as a makeshift helicopter port and encampment for National Guard troops and relief workers after the storm. Athletic facilities In 1898 the Audubon golf course opened within the park. In 2002, the golf course was renovated and converted to a mostly Par 3 executive course, to complaints from many non-golfing users of the park, who alleged that the original Olmsted Brothers design was being desecrated. The Heymann Memorial Conservatory, closed for many years prior, was demolished to accommodate the golf course renovation and new golf clubhouse. Also in 2002, the New Orleans city council renamed the park's \\"Avenger Field\\" to \\"David Berger - Avenger Field\\" in memory of David Mark Berger, an athlete and graduate of Tulane University who was captured and killed in the 1972 Olympic Games hostage crisis. The field was officially dedicated to Berger's memory on June 10, 2013.  Wildlife  Trio of great egrets at Ochsner Island Rookery in Audubon Park. Ochsner Island on the east side of the park features a rookery that is one of the prime birding spots in Greater New Orleans. The island attracts hundreds of wading birds, including great egrets, cattle egrets, snowy egrets, ibis, little blue herons, green herons, night herons and others. The park is also home to diving double-crested cormorants and anhingas, as well as to many species of ducks. Recently, black-bellied whistling ducks have begun using the park's lagoons as a stopover on their migrations.

A provisional nationalist government was established by Kemal Atat√ºrk at Angora, which he declared to be the new capital. Having expelled the Greek invaders of Asia Minor (1921‚Äì1922) and averted a war with Britain (1923), Atat√ºrk was able to proclaim the new republic of Turkey on 28 October 1923 with himself as president. Ankara was confirmed as the capital despite the reinstatement of Constantinople (now Istanbul) as Turkish territory. During the period of the provisional government (1920‚Äì1923), various overprints were issued at Angora. In 1922, two sets of definitives were issued (cat. nos A79-A90 and A119-A124).

The Spaniards were driven out by the Dutch in 1634. Apart from a brief period of British rule during the Napoleonic Wars, it has remained a Dutch territory ever since, forming part of the Netherlands Antilles until 1986. The economic situation in the 1970s led to demands for separation. This was achieved on 1 January 1986 when Aruba was granted the status of internal autonomy within the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

Austria, home of the Habsburg dynasty, had been the central part of the Holy Roman Empire. In the aftermath of Waterloo, Austria was one of the strongest nations in Europe and its foreign minister Metternich became the architect of the Concert of Europe which was able to maintain peace in a divided continent for several decades. Hungary, the land of the Magyars that lies to the east of Austria, was part of the Austrian Empire at that time but it constantly sought control of its own affairs. Austria faced a crisis after its defeat by Prussia in the Seven Weeks War of 1866. To consolidate his power, the Emperor Franz Josef negotiated in March 1867 the Ausgleich (Compromise) with the Magyar ruling classes. As a result, Hungary gained control of its internal affairs and the two states of Austria and Hungary were federated into what became commonly known as the Dual Monarchy. The words Kaiserliche und K√∂nigliche on Austrian stamps refer to the Empire of Austria and the Kingdom of Hungary, both titles being held by Franz Josef. The Dual Monarchy endured until the end of WWI. Austria and Hungary had separate postal administration from the time of the Ausgleich although it was not until May 1871 that Hungary could issue its first stamps. In the meantime, a set of \\"neutral\\" stamps were issued that showed a profile of Franz Josef and a value. The fact of the Dual Monarchy was emphasised in stamps issued abroad by Austro-Hungarian post offices or military forces. Hence, reference should be made to Austria and Hungary separately re home issues and to the various Austro-Hungarian entries for overseas issues. ;Refer :Austria; :Austro- Hungarian Military Post; :Austro-Hungarian Occupation of Bosnia & Herzegovina; :Austro-Hungarian Post Offices in the Turkish Empire; :Hungary Austrian Italy ;Refer :Lombardy & Venetia Austrian Levant ;Refer :Austro- Hungarian Post Offices in the Turkish Empire Austrian Territories acquired by Italy ;Refer :Italian Austria Austro-Hungarian Military Post Stamps inscribed K-u-K FELDPOST were issued in Serbia (1916), Montenegro (1917), Romania (1917‚Äì1918) and Italy (1918). ;Dates :1915 ‚Äì 1918 ;Currency :100 heller = 1 krone (General Issues, Serbia, Montenegro); :100 centesimi = 1 lira (Italy); :100 bani = 1 leu (Rumania) ;Main Article : ;Includes :Italy (Austrian Occupation); :Montenegro (Austrian Occupation); :Rumania (Austrian Occupation); :Serbia (Austrian Occupation) Austro-Hungarian Occupation of Bosnia & Herzegovina ;Refer :Bosnia & Herzegovina Austro-Hungarian Post Offices in the Turkish Empire Austria had various issues, some with overprinted values, for use in its offices throughout the Turkish Empire, including those in territory that now belongs to Greece.

The game features the ability to replay past Super Bowls and provides historical descriptions of them. NFL Quarterback Club '99 delivers all 31 teams and 3D rendered stadiums (also included are the Cleveland Browns). 1,500 players are featured in the game with over 250 motion-capture animations. Players, along with teams, uniforms, coaches, and playbooks can also be created and used in game. Play- by-play is handled by Mike Patrick, color calls by Randy Cross and referee calls by Jerry Markbreit. Charlie Weis and Dedric Ward served as consultants for the game. Gameplay NFL Quarterback Club '99 expands upon its predecessor's gameplay significantly through the addition of more fluent controls, animations and graphics. While these are seemingly minor additions to the game, these improvements can serve to make the game much more enjoyable and appealing to fans of the NFL. The game allows the user to play as every NFL team that was available at the time (1999 NFL Season) and control all of its players, including newly drafted early round quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf. Each team has ratings based on certain strengths and weaknesses observed in the 1998 NFL season and projections by the developers. This provides a realistic lack of power balance between a team like the San Diego Chargers and the Green Bay Packers. In addition, the game featured teams from NFL Europe. Like its predecessor, the game features many glitches. The most notable is a glitch that allows a player who is controlling a quarterback the ability to gain a significant amount of speed, or sort of teleport, by using the pump fake technique. Reception NFL Quarterback Club 99 received favorable reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings.

Her story became a biographical novel, and was the subject of the 1991 film Thousand Pieces of Gold.  Early life  Bemis with her horses Nellie and Julie, Feb 6, 1910 On September 11, 1853, Bemis was born in rural northern China, near one of the upper villages. As a child, Bemis had bound feet, which were later unbound. When she was eighteen, there was a prolonged drought, during which her father sold her to bandits for two much needed bags of seed. In 1872, Bemis was smuggled into the United States and sold as a slave in San Francisco, California for $2,500. It was common for Chinese men of that time to have multiple wives and concubines, all having some social status and living under the same roof. When a Chinese man moved to North America, he might take a concubine with him or acquire one there, as custom required him to leave his wife in China to take care of his parents. An intermediary took her from San Francisco via Portland, Oregon, to Idaho, where her buyer, a wealthy Chinese man, possibly named Hong King, ran a saloon in a mining camp in Warrens, Idaho Territory, now Warren, Idaho. She arrived in Warrens on July 8, 1872. Bemis was tall. How Bemis gained her freedom from her Chinese owner is uncertain. According to academic Priscilla Wegars, her Chinese owner helped her gain her freedom. In mid-1880, the census listed her as living with saloon owner and fiddler Charlie Bemis (1848-October 29, 1922), who befriended her when she first arrived in Warrens, and protected her from unwanted advances. Charlie's \\"fearless personality, coupled with his skill at shooting, enabled him to maintain order without getting into trouble\\". During her time in her Chinese owner's saloon, Bemis would often call for Charlie if \\"things got too rough\\", or she would leave through the saloon's back door and enter through Charlie's, who \\"never failed her\\".  Career  Bemis was not financially dependent on Charlie Bemis. Bemis took in laundry from miners and ran a boarding house that he built for her beside his own, a short distance from his saloon. Charlie was almost killed during a gambling dispute in September 1890, when he was shot in the cheek, and Bemis nursed him back to health. In addition to laundry and nursing skills, Bemis was an expert at angler fishing in the Salmon River.  Personal life  On August 13, 1894, Bemis married Charlie Bemis, son of a Connecticut Yankee jeweler. Bemis was a four and a half feet woman of Chinese descent. They moved from Warren to a site 17 miles north by trail at a spot that came to be called both Bemis Point and Polly Place. Peter Klinkhammer, the couple's friend, reported that this was a marriage of convenience as Polly needed to establish legal residency in the USA and Charlie Bemis needed someone to take care of him. Bemis's struggle for legal permanent residency went to the courts in Moscow, Idaho and her residency was finally granted on August 10, 1896 in Helena, Montana. Together, Charlie and Polly Bemis filed a mining claim, becoming among the first pioneers to settle along the Salmon River (The River of No Return), only several yards from the riverside. Even today this house is not accessible by road. Boats are a common means of access. Although the couple had no children‚ÄîBemis was 40 when they married, she was noted for her concern for children. They also were known to garden and care for a number of animals, including horses and a cougar. Bemis was also noted for her nursing skills, fishing, friendliness, wit, and sense of humor. Bemis saved Charlie's life a second time. In the summer of 1922, a fire gutted their home on the Salmon River, possibly caused by an untended or overheated woodstove. Charlie was inside at the time, and Polly, along with their friend Shepp, rescued him from the burning house. The Bemis' moved across the Salmon River to live with mining partners Peter Klinkhammer and Charlie Shepp, both German, who had been long-time neighbors and friends. In late October of 1922, Charlie Bemis died. He had been ill in the last several years, reportedly due to a lung ailment (probably tuberculosis). Klinkhammer and Shepp rebuilt a new home for Bemis in the same spot as the one that burned down, with the understanding that they would inherit this from her in exchange for their labor and for looking after her in her old age. During construction, she moved to Warren. While on a trip to Boise, Idaho, she stayed at the Idanha hotel and saw her first movie, rode her first streetcar, and had her first elevator ride. Bemis gave the photo of herself in her wedding dress to a young schoolgirl, Gay Carrey, who boarded with her during the academic year during this time. In 1924 she moved back to the now completed cabin on Salmon River. On August 4, 1933, Shepp came to visit Bemis and found her lying on the ground, incoherent and incapacitated following what may have been a stroke. On August 6 she was taken to Grangeville, Idaho, where she stayed in the Idaho Valley Hospital for three months. Loquacious during her hospitalization, she spoke about many details of her life, and on November 5 a lengthy newspaper article was published about her. On November 6, 1933, Bemis died of myocarditis in Grangeville, Idaho at the age of 80. Two days later, Bemis was buried in Grangeville, Idaho. After Klinkhammer's death in 1970, his sister bought a marker for Bemis's grave. Legacy Charles and Polly Bemis In 1987, the cabin, known as Polly Bemis House, was restored. Bemis's body was reburied on the grounds by the cabin, which is located 17 miles north of Warren, Idaho. The cabin became a museum, and in 1988, it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1987, a dedication ceremony was held and Idaho Governor Cecil Andrus stated, \\"The history of Polly Bemis is a great part of the legacy of central Idaho. She is the foremost pioneer on the rugged Salmon River.\\" Bemis was inducted into the Idaho Hall of Fame in 1996. Bemis is the subject of a series of paintings, Chinese in Idaho, by Chinese-American artist Hung Liu. The University of Idaho has described her as \\"Idaho's most famous Chinese woman,\\" and offered an anthropology course called \\"The World of Polly Bemis\\". Ongoing biographical debates Charles Bemis 1895 court case involving Polly Bemis, who could not renew her residence papers due to an Idaho snowstorm Current biographers continue to debate the details of Polly Bemis' life. For example, there is little evidence that she was ever actually known as \\"Lalu\\" or that \\"Hong King\\" was really her owner's name. Also, there is no evidence that Bemis was actually a prostitute; from a cultural standpoint, it is more likely that Bemis was a concubine. One National Park Service site claims she was an indentured dance hostess. Finally, as she neared death, Bemis denied the long-standing public belief that she was \\"won in a poker game.\\" According to a summary of author McCunn's research in the San Francisco Chronicle, \\"Charlie married Polly to prevent her from being deported as a result of the 1892 Geary Act, which required legal Chinese residents to carry a certificate of admission, something Polly lacked. Despite Idaho's anti-miscegenation laws, the Bemises were wed by a white judge, who himself was married to a Tukudeka Indian.\\" Books and films about her life * A biography was written in the 1970s - see Idaho County's Most Romantic Character: Polly Bemis by Sister M Alfreda Elsensohn (published by Benedictine Sisters; Second Printing in 1987). *Thousand Pieces of Gold is a 1981 biographical historical novel about Lalu Nathoy/Polly Bemis and includes an essay in which the author, Ruthanne Lum McCunn, documents her research for the book and her discoveries in the years since Polly's death.

During Egypt's Old Kingdom, pyramidia were generally made of diorite, granite, or fine limestone, then covered in gold or electrum; during the Middle Kingdom and through the end of the pyramid-building era, they were built from granite.Pyramidia by Alan Winston A pyramidion was \\"covered in gold leaf to reflect the rays of the sun\\"; during Egypt's Middle Kingdom pyramidia were often \\"inscribed with royal titles and religious symbols\\". Very few pyramidia have survived into modern times. Most of those that remain are made of polished black granite, inscribed with the name of the pyramid's owner. Four pyramidia ‚Äì the world's largest collection ‚Äì are housed in the main hall of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Among them are the pyramidia from the so-called Black Pyramid of Amenemhat III at Dahshur and of the Pyramid of Khendjer at Saqqara.editors Regine Schulz and Matthias Seidel (w/34 contributing Authors), Egypt, The World of the Pharaohs, Konemann, Germany: 1998. Amenemhat III, 1842‚Äì1797 BC A badly damaged white Tura limestone pyramidion, thought to have been made for the Red Pyramid of Sneferu at Dahshur, has been reconstructed and is on open-air display beside that pyramid; it presents a minor mystery, however, as its angle of inclination is steeper than that of the edifice it was apparently built to surmount.  Private brick pyramids with pyramidia  During the New Kingdom, some private underground tombs were marked on the surface by small brick pyramids that terminated in pyramidia. The four lateral sides included texts and scenes related to the cult of the Sun God (as the representation of Pharaoh). The scenes typically depict the course of the sun, rising on one lateral face, setting on the opposite face, and traveling, through the night, through the underworld, ruled by Osiris. =Scribe Mose pyramidion= The pyramidion of Mose (mes,s, New Kingdom, 19th Dynasty, c. 1250 BC, limestone, 53 cm tall) depicts himself making an offering, with his name on two opposite faces.

The Brand of Honor is part of the PBR Heroes and Legends Celebration, the PBR's unique way of honoring outstanding individuals and livestock in the sport of rodeo. For a bucking bull, this is the highest honor he can receive in the sport of bull riding. He was a bucking bull who was known throughout the rodeo sport of bull riding as \\"the world's most dangerous bull.\\" He was also known as \\"the greatest bull ever to buck.\\" In 1999, Bodacious was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame, and in 2017 into the Bull Riding Hall of Fame. During his rodeo career he was the 1995 PBR World Champion Bull plus the 1994 and 1995 Professional Rodeo Cowboy Association (PRCA) Bucking Bull of the Year. He and Bruiser are the only bulls who have won both titles. Bodacious won his titles in 1995, and Bruiser won his in 2017. Bodacious is most well known for his serious injury to bull riding icon Tuff Hedeman. Coincidentally, Hedeman is the only bull rider to win the world champion bull rider title in both associations too. Not long after, Bodacious also seriously injured Scott Breding. His owner, Sammy Andrews, then retired Bodacious. He died at age 12 in 2000.  Early life  Bodacious, born in 1988 on the Merrick Ranch in the Arbuckle Mountains of Oklahoma, was a Charolais/Brahman crossbred known as a Charbray. Bodacious was born a unique yellow color, which was the only thing that distinguished him from the rest of the herd, most of whom were gray-blues and creams. Bill McCann, co-owner of Geary Livestock Auction, near Okeene, Oklahoma, regularly bought cattle from the Merrick Ranch and resold them at auction. In one of the loads he bought, he remembered a yellow calf. In the winter of 1991, when a rancher named Jess Kephart came by McCann's auction yard in Kenton, Oklahoma, looking for herd and bucking bulls, the yellow calf that McCann had culled appealed to him. Kephart purchased the calf from McCann and took the bull home to Longdale, Oklahoma. He branded the then-unnamed Bodacious with \\"J\\" for his first initial. When the young bull was three years old, Kephart decided Bodacious wasn't what he wanted in a herd bull. When Phil Sumner, a rodeo stock contractor, showed up to see another bull, Kephart offered to throw in \\"the yellow bull\\". Sumner paid Kephard about 50 cents a pound, \\"the going rate for beef on the hoof\\". It worked out to $700. Sumner took Kephart's \\"J\\" brand and extended it to J-31: the 3 stood for the month of March, and 1 stood for 1991, the year he bought the bull. He also weighed young Bodacious at . Sumner never named the bull either due to not feeling sure his bucking ability would give him a good chance at a rodeo career. Early bucking career Sumner brought the skinny three-year-old bull to buck in some local rodeos in northern Oklahoma, but was not impressed with the results. At first, the bull could jump high but \\"couldn‚Äôt seem to figure out the point\\" of the cowboy on his back. The first three riders easily rode until the whistle on him. \\"I was thinking, Dude, you‚Äôre going to have to step up your game plan or you‚Äôre going to be going to McDonald's,\\" Sumner said. But at a rodeo outside Okeene, Oklahoma, a rookie got his hand caught in his bull rope at the top of the bull's back. When the rider started flailing around the side of the bull, trying to dislodge his hand, Bodacious panicked. The bull spun, jumped, and kicked, trying to get free of the rider. He kicked so high he almost flipped over. \\"By the time the boy pulled free, the bull had nearly gone over the fence\\". \\"After that, he had a goal: airmail those cowboys.\\" According to Sumner, something happened to Bodacious after that, and he decided \\"he didn't want anybody on him or near him\\". He learned more effective ways to buck people off. Old videos of Bodacious taken from age 3 to age 5 show Bodacious practicing these methods. It didn't take long until bull riders at the local amateur rodeos refused to take on the yellow bull. = 1991 amateur season = Sumner took the bull as an amateur to a few rodeo events sanctioned by the International Professional Rodeo Association (IPRA) and the PRCA in 1991. D&H; Cattle Company is a well-known and respected stock contractor. However, both father Dillon Page, and son H.D. Page were both professional bull riders prior to being stock contractors and bull breeders. Later the Pages bred and hauled Bodacious' progeny. In 1991, H.D. attempted Bodacious three times. The first time Page attempted Bodacious was in Edmond, Oklahoma, in an IPRA sanctioned rodeo. According to Page, Bodacious \\"smashed my face pretty good on the way up\\". Then Page drew the bull a second time at his hometown in Ada, Oklahoma, in a $1,000-added PRCA event. His friends convinced Page to wear a helmet this time. Page maintains that the bull got him in the face again but on the way back down instead, in the helmet. The very next weekend at Athens, Texas, he drew the bull again. Page said, \\"You've got to be kidding me!\\" Despite being hit in the face again, this time Page managed to stay on for the requisite eight seconds, but one of the judges disqualified him for a slap. A slap or any other touching of the bull with the free hand is against the rules and disqualifies the rider, even if he stays on for the required time. Terry Don West is best known for riding the infamous bull Bodacious. He also has five world champion bull rider titles between the PRCA, IPRA and BRO. West had attempted Bodacious four times and gotten a qualified ride twice. In 1991, at a PRCA event, two-time World Bull Riding Champion Terry Don West rode Bodacious for West's first of two qualified rides. His ride went down in history as the first qualified ride on the as yet unknown bull, and the prize money bore that out, as West won only $181. His ride was the first qualified ride, yet it was not the first qualified professional ride. One day when Sumner was watching the bull roam around his pasture near Goltry, Oklahoma, he realized he might have a major league bull. He contacted his friend Sammy Andrews of the Andrews Rodeo Company in Addielou, Texas, a third-generation stock contractor. Sumner sold him to Andrews in 1992 for $7,500. Andrews gave Bodacious his name, and hauled the bull to buck at rodeos for his entire professional career. Professional bucking career  Under Andrews' ownership, Bodacious bucked professionally on the PRCA and PBR circuits. Bodacious bucked for two years in the PBR, in 1994 and 1995. He bucked for four years in the PRCA, from 1992 to 1995. He also bucked for three years in the Bull Riders Only (BRO) circuit from 1993 to 1995. =1992 season= Bodacious only bucked on the PRCA circuit in this season. In 1992, soon after he bought the bull, Andrews took Bodacious to Houston, Texas, to one of the PRCA's biggest rodeos, the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. Hall of fame bull rider Cody Lambert was matched with Bodacious, who knocked him unconscious. Later in 1992, Bubba Dunn drew the bull at Lufkin, Texas. Since Dunn was unfamiliar with the bull, he asked Andrews about him; Andrews told him the bull had \\"a lot of down\\", which meant Dunn should watch out for the bull's head meeting up with his own. Dunn made the whistle at eight seconds and became the first rider to make a professional qualified ride on Bodacious. Two months after Dunn rode Bodacious, Canadian Greg Schlosser drew Bodacious in San Antonio, Texas. Earlier, Lambert had warned Schlosser about Bodacious, saying that the bull was one of the baddest bulls he had been on. Schlosser had flown in all the way from Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and was undeterred after traveling so far. Schlosser made the whistle and scored 82 points on Bodacious. Meanwhile, Bodacious had grown into his full adult weight of . He had gained several hundred pounds since starting his career on the PRCA, and developed massive muscles including a \\"bulging neck\\". Most bulls at this weight become slower, but Bodacious did not. When he jumped up and \\"jerked riders onto his broad head, he did it with the full force\\" of his weight. Hedeman's first attempt to ride Bodacious was in Memphis, Tennessee. Hedeman described the experience as \\"unbelievable,\\" explaining, \\"when he left the chute his front end came up so high. I was right in the middle of him, and riding him like you have to ride a bull with a lot of downdraft. But my chest was touching his horns, and my head was right over the top of his. I couldn't keep my hand in the rope.\\" His first attempt failed. Hedeman drew the bull a month later at a rodeo in Tampa, Florida. That time, Hedeman's hand came loose from the bull rope at five and a half seconds and though he hung on a bit longer, Bodacious threw him just before the eight-second mark. Andrews took Bodacious to the 1992 National Finals Rodeo (NFR) that year in Las Vegas, Nevada. Andrews was nervous about the night that Jim \\"Razor\\" Sharp had drawn Bodacious. At that time, Sharp was already a two-time world champion. Sharp expected to ride this bull who was much better than average, but whose full reputation had not been established yet. After Bodacious came out of the chute, he turned back, then he threw Sharp off pretty hard because Sharp made \\"two-and-a-half flips in the air\\". =1993 season= Bodacious bucked on the PRCA and BRO circuits in this season. In 1993, Terry Don West attempted Bodacious again, and Bodacious bucked him off and bruised his ribs. In 1993, Hedeman participated in the 1993 BRO World Finals, in Long Beach, California. He remained resolute in his determination to get a qualified ride on Bodacious. \\"He was like a monster once he matured. Even the good guys were very scared of him. You‚Äôd see world champions ride him for a jump or two and then get off.\\" This time, Hedeman scored 95 points on Bodacious in his third attempt on him. Hedeman felt this ride was the best in his career. He explained \\"the judges told me they wished I hadn't been the first guy out. They were saving some room, on the chance that there would possibly be a better ride. But when it was over they said they'd have marked me higher if I'd ridden last. Sammy Andrews, who owned Bodacious, said he'd have marked me 98 or 99, and that it was the best ride he'd ever seen\\". There are those who consider it the greatest ride in history, \\"a near perfect exhibition of balance and anticipation.\\" The ride helped Hedeman win the 1993 BRO world championship title. At the National Western Stock Show and Rodeo in Denver, Colorado, Ben \\"Legs\\" Stevenson scored 93 points on Bodacious. It was the last qualified ride on the bull until West scored on him in 1995. =1994 season= Bodacious bucked on the PRCA, BRO and PBR circuits in this season. In 1994, Terry Don West attempted Bodacious a third time, and it nearly killed him. It was at a PRCA event at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo in Houston, Texas. He opted out of wearing any protection during the ride. Bodacious battered West with his head and shoulders as West was falling off him. West received broken ribs, a broken wrist, and a punctured lung. West's wife, Michelle, revealed that West didn't want to get on Bodacious that night, and she had made light of his fears. \\"Then when he was lying out there, gasping for air, about to pass on, I said to myself 'That's real smart, Michelle.' I decided never to put my two cents in from then on.\\" Bodacious received national attention for this incident. At Houston, PRCA World Champion Bull Rider Cody Custer also attempted Bodacious for the first time. Custer acknowledged he was nervous and said this was \\"probably the biggest challenge in my life\\". Bodacious burst out of the chute, and then he jumped to the side once. Then he charged forward, which sent his rear legs over Custer's head. \\"For a moment, it looked as if Custer could withstand the force\\", but then he was thrown, a horn nicking his cheek. Custer only made two seconds on the bull. \\"I don't know,\\" Custer said later, stunned, \\"He does something to get your feet behind you.\\" 1994 also marked the first year that Bodacious also bucked on the PBR circuit. At an elite Bud Light Cup (BLC) event in Nashville, Tennessee, Scott Breding bucked off Bodacious just short of the 8-second whistle. Then later that year at a PBR event in Guthrie, Oklahoma, 1994 PRCA World Champion bull rider Daryl Mills bucked off Bodacious. Later on at the inaugural PBR World Finals in Las Vegas, Nevada, in the Championship round, Clint Branger (who had successfully ridden the bull at Bullnanza in Guthrie, Oklahoma in 1993 bucked off Bodacious just shy of the requisite eight seconds. This buck-off ultimately cost Branger the 1994 PBR World Champion title. Also, at the 1994 Bull Riders Only World Finals in Denver, Colorado, Bodacious bucked off Brent Thurman during the Championship round, just shy of reaching the eight-second mark. =1995 season= Bodacious bucked on the PRCA and PBR circuits in this season. In February 1995, according to the cowboys, Bodacious \\"learned a new trick, a sort of stutter hop on his front legs, followed by a faster, more powerful lift with his head\\". In Lufkin, Texas, at a PRCA event, Bubba Dunn took Bodacious on for a second time, and he scored 93 points. During this ride, Bodacious \\"creased the brim of Bubba‚Äôs hat and bruised his cheek\\". Dunn felt lucky those were his only injuries that day. \\"Bo was psychotic. He didn‚Äôt like people.\\" says Lambert. \\"If you were on his back, he wanted to hurt you.\\" Dunn only attempted Bodacious two times, and he rode him both of those times. In fact, he said, \\"In 1995, (heck), I had to ride Bodacious to get invited to the PBR.\\" In 1995, at the San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo in San Antonio, Texas, West of Henryetta, Oklahoma, took on Bodacious for a fourth time at a PRCA event. Despite his injuries in the past, he made his second qualified ride on the bull, scoring 87 points and earning $10,365. This time he wore a protective vest. His qualified ride on Bodacious won him the round. The score between them now was 2-2. The qualified ride on Bodacious marked the first time the bull had been ridden in two years. In June 1995, at a PBR event in Nashville, Tennessee, Australian bull rider Rodney Lidgard drew Bodacious in Round 1 and bucked off the bull in 1.30 seconds. The judges decided that was enough time to give the bull an outstanding bull score of 48 points, which is very rare. In May 1995, at a PBR event in Charlotte, North Carolina, multiple hall of fame cowboy Ty Murray drew Bodacious in round 1. He bucked off the bull in 1.70 seconds. Bodacious was given a bull score of 44 points, a relatively low score. Also in May 1995, also in the same round, a cowboy recorded only by his last name of Willard drew Bodacious. He bucked off the bull in 1.60 seconds. Again, the judges decided this short buckoff qualified for an outstanding bull score of 48 points. In September 1995, at a PBR event in Guthrie, Oklahoma, Clint Branger rode Bodacious. The bull had bucked off Branger in 1994, but at the Bullnanza event held at the Lazy E Arena, Branger evened the score, riding the bull for 92 points. Bodacious was given a bull score of 46 points for the outing. In September 1995, during the Championship round of a PBR event, also in Guthrie, Oklahoma, Jerome Davis drew Bodacious. He was bucked off the bull in 6.60 seconds, who was given a bull score of 46 points. In October 1995 at the PBR World Finals in Las Vegas, Nevada, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, Hedeman drew Bodacious. His confidence was high, his riding percentage was high, and he was the point leader by \\"an insurmountable three hundred points\\". Hedeman felt sure he would ride the bull this time. From 1993 to 1995, Bodacious had been out of competition for long periods due to an injury; however, he returned as a more dangerous animal, having developed a new bucking move \\"involving him bringing his rear up with his head to the ground, luring a rider to shift his weight forward, and then thrusting his head up full force, to smash the rider in the face\\". An article in the New Yorker described the encounter: > This time, a split second after leaving the chute, the bull bucked forward > with all his might. Hedeman did what riders are supposed to do: he leaned > high over the bull‚Äôs shoulders and flung his arm back as a counterbalance. > But just as he came forward, Bodacious threw his head back‚Äîsmashing it > square into Hedeman‚Äôs face. Hedeman stayed on somehow, his hand twisted in > the rope, only to get head-butted again, thrown into the air, and bounced > off the bull‚Äôs back like a rag doll. Hedeman lasted four seconds. Looking back at the ride, Hedeman feels he was \\"overconfident and underprepared\\". \\"When I nodded for him, the first jump felt fine,\\" he said. \\"Then, all of a sudden, whack! When I hit the ground, I felt numb.\\" What Hedeman could not see was how his face really looked; how much blood was on it. \\"When I was walking out of the arena I bit down and my teeth didn't come together, so I figured my jaw was broken,\\" Hedeman recalled. \\"I didn't realize my whole face was smashed. But when I looked at people looking at me, they looked like they'd seen the devil.\\" At the hospital, doctors diagnosed Hedeman and said every major bone in his face was broken. Hedeman went through two surgeries which installed six titanium plates and totaled 13 hours. On discharge, the swelling of his face was so extreme that his own young son could not recognize him. In December 1995 at the NFR, Hedeman drew Bodacious for the last time in the seventh round of the finals, part of the Championship round, about two months after his previous bout with the bull. Hedeman \\"had lost twenty-five pounds and his body was still healing, but he‚Äôd managed to qualify for the National Finals Rodeo anyway\\". When it was Bodacious he drew, he climbed onto the bull's back in the chute to secure his eligibility to ride the following night, but he let the bull go out without him when the chute opened. He called Bodacious, \\"the baddest bull there has ever been.\\" Then, in the 9th round of the NFR two nights later, bull rider Scott Breding drew Bodacious. Breding had attempted Bodacious two times before. Scott Breding gave him his final professional ride. He tried wearing a hockey mask for the ride. It took less than four seconds for Bodacious to use the same move that he did on Hedeman to fracture Scott's left eye socket and cheekbone. He also broke his nose and knocked him unconscious. After treatment, Breding was released from University Medical Center and attended the remainder of the NFR but did not compete further. In round 10 of the next day, December 11, 1995, the gate opened to reveal Sammy Andrews and then a yellow bull flashed out of a chute without a rider. Andrews announced that his famous bull was officially retired. The crowd was both shocked and relieved. Bodacious was 7 years old at the time, still in his prime. \\"I didn‚Äôt want to be the guy who let him kill someone,\\" he said. \\"We're going to put him out on top,\\" said Andrews. \\"I was hoping Scott would get by him. If the bull ever needed ridden it was last night. But these boys (bull riders) have made me.\\" Andrews said Bodacious would be used for breeding. =1996 season= Though officially retired, Bodacious did buck at a few non-sanctioned events in 1996 before being permanently retired. One such out came at the now defunct Original Coors Showdown Rodeo in Phoenix, Arizona, against bull rider Bryan Barker, whom the bull proceeded to buck off in under 3 seconds, earning a bull score of 48. This was his last known appearance at a rodeo. =1997 season= The 1996 BRO World Championships were held April 3‚Äì5, 1997 at the Thomas and Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. Despite some injuries, Terry Don West was intent on riding a bull named Woolly Bully on finals night. Not only did West manage to ride the bull for 8 seconds, but he turned in a 91 point score. \\"This, tonight, is a dream come true,\\" West said of that night's ride which won him the 1996 Bull Riders Only world championship title. Bull rider Shane Thurston came in second place with an 84 on the bull Nitro. Thurston and West made the only qualified rides in the championship round. West was reported as saying he would ride the infamous bull Bodacious in a sponsored match for the Bull Riders Only Championship in April 1997. The plan at that point was to bring the bull out of retirement to face West or another cowboy if West was not signed up by BRO officials in time for the week of October 3‚Äì5. The event was planned to take place in Las Vegas. Retired in 1995, BRO planned a big event to bring him out of retirement in 1996 and have a special matchup with a bull rider. Although the bull was retired due to injuries he was causing riders, many want to see him buck again for another ride. It was planned to have him buck at the BRO World Championship in Las Vegas. The then rider in the works to match up with him was Terry Don West, who just won the PRCA bull riding champion title. \\"I don't think anyone craves getting on that bull,\\" said West recently. \\"But if the money's right, that would be the reason I would want to get on him. We're in negotiations, and I'm sure there are other guys wanting a shot at him, too. But I think the fans out there would love to see me matched up with him.\\" The president of BRO, Shaw Sullivan, assured everyone that Bodacious would not be put into a draw. \\"It'll be a match,\\" Sullivan said. \\"With West matched against him, it would be the rankest bull in the world and the rankest bull rider.\\" The event was planned to be held at the Thomas and Mack Arena. It was to be broadcast by the Fox Television Network to 100 million homes. =End of career= Bodacious was to be brought out of retirement one final time in the spring of 1997. On Saturday, April 5, 1997, Terry Don West planned to take on Bodacious for a fifth and final time in an attempt to break their 2-2 tie. Fox Television talked West into it, with the $10,000 purse being donated to Sunrise Children's Hospital. This event was to cap off the $1 million Wrangler Bull Riders Only (BRO) 1996 World Championships at the Thomas & Mack Center. \\"I hope this is the last time they buck that bull. He will kill somebody,\\" said West, who was the reigning PRCA World Bull Riding Champion at the time. West nervously climbed into Bodacious' pen for a photography session at Harrah's. The bull was accompanied by a familiar cow and two calves to keep him calm. \\"He'll tear the pen up,\\" West said. \\"When I got in there, he gave me a look, saying 'Don't get no closer. You'll pay for it.'\\" West, then 31 years old, was slated to wear a chest vest and a face mask. He also pre-purchased additional insurance. Bodacious may have been inactive for almost two years, but \\"Bo hasn't forgotten how to buck,\\" said West. However, two nights before the match scheduled with Bodacious, West had a match with a bull named Bananarama. Bananarama fell back against the chute while West was getting ready, pinning West and resulting in two black eyes, a broken ankle, and a concussion. West was not able to compete the following night nor to take on Bodacious by Saturday night at their scheduled time. Thus, West's fifth ride with Bodacious never took place. This meant that Bo's retirement stayed in effect, and at that time, it was well along the second year. Fox nevertheless donated the money to the children's hospital.  Career summary  Bodacious bucked under two other names during his career. For a time, he bucked as \\"Skoal's Bodacious\\" when a tobacco company was sponsoring him. Later he bucked as \\"Dodge Bodacious\\" when he was representing an automotive company as a \\"spokesbull.\\" The name Dodge Bodacious even appears on some of his PRCA awards and media material. In GQ Magazine, he was described as, \\"the fiercest competitor of his generation...lethal, a legend, the Michael Jordan of barnyard brutes... a combination of Babe Ruth, Secretariat, and Sonny Liston.\\" Bodacious bucked on the PBR Premier Series at least five times, and scored over 45+ points all but one of those times. His average is 46.4 which puts him second in the ProBullStats Historical Ranking, with Dillinger still being in first place. He has an 80% buck off rate on the Premier Series alone. Records were not kept as scrupulously in Bodacious' time, but the majority of sources say riders attempted Bodacious at least 135 times. Of those 135 attempts, around eight to ten qualified rides were made on the bull by approximately seven different cowboys. Bull riders who rode him twice include Bubba Dunn, Clint Branger, and Terry Don West. Tuff Hedeman, Jim Sharp, Greg Schossler, and Legs Stevenson each made a qualified ride on him once. Since Bodacious' death, fans and journalists debate whether Bodacious was really the best bucking bull. > It's probably true that the bull scared cowboys into allowing themselves to > be slingshotted. Every bull rider‚Äôs worst fear is getting jerked down onto a > bull‚Äôs head, and cowboys who stayed on Bodacious beyond the first two jumps > usually got hurt. Of the bull‚Äôs 127 wins, more than a few were likely the > result of cowboys deciding to let him... But if you ask top cowboys, the > hype got hooked to a bull that deserved most of it. \\"I don‚Äôt have fond > memories of him, but Bodacious was the best ever,\\" says Cody Lambert. Tuff, > who tried the bull four times, rode him the third and almost died the > fourth, says Bodacious was one of the rankest bulls of all time, even though > \\"by the end he was basically a cheap shot artist who would Sunday punch > you.\\" Sammy says the bull‚Äôs fame has to do with timing.

And in the big yellow bull that intimidated even the best, it has > apparently found one to hold onto  Retirement and death  Bodacious spent his retirement on the Andrews Rodeo Company Ranch. He could be found relaxing in the pasture or mating under natural cover. He mated with a total of 120 cows in his retirement. Otherwise, he might be on a tour. Initially, Andrews stored his semen. However, when the breeding organization, Buckers, Inc., was formed, Bodacious was its first client. The organization's goal were \\"keeping the legacy of Bodacious alive\\" and improving bull breeding. Buckers also became the manager of Bo's marketing. During Bodacious' retirement life, his owner obtained a New York agent to manage public appearances. He was taken on tour to state fairs, rodeos, and casinos around the United States. He appeared as a celebrity guest at Harrah's Las Vegas and the Silverton Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Articles about him appeared in Sports Illustrated, GQ, and Penthouse. He appeared in advertising for Bud Light. He also was featured on merchandise, including items such as belt buckles and watches from Montana Silversmiths, a limited commemorative edition Winchester Rifle by A&A; Entraving, and T-shirts. Prior to his death, \\"Wrangler had just issued a new Bodacious T-shirt and \\"Bo\\" was featured, along with Tuff Hedeman, in advertising for Bud Light\\". The most recent merchandise is the Bodacious figurine toy. Created in 2017, Bodacious the bull comes with a bull rider, bull rope, and stand. It was approved by Andrews Rodeo Company on March 5, 2017. His television appearances included a profile on the Fox TV program \\"Guinness World Records Prime Time.\\" He was profiled on BRO telecasts on the Cowboy Lifestyle Network. After his death, the NBCSN (formerly Outdoor Life Network) program \\"Fearless\\" visited the Andrews Rodeo Company Ranch in 2004 and filmed a documentary titled, \\"Fearless Bodacious.\\" Many made tributes to Bodacious over the years. Some examples include alternative rock band Primus, who dedicated a song to Bodacious on their 1999 album, Antipop. It is called \\"Ballad of Bodacious.\\" The Austrian ski company Blizzard Ski named their big mountain ski after Bodacious. Lastly, Short's Brewing Company named a double-Black IPA \\"Goodnight Bodacious\\" after Bodacious. Bodacious developed a hoof infection when he was 12 years old. The medication used to cure the infection damaged his kidneys, and as a result, he died of kidney failure at 12 years of age in 2000. He died in his holding pen at the Andrew Rodeo Company Ranch on May 16, 2000. In 2004, The Houston Rodeo and Livestock Show had a miniature bucking chute manufactured and gave it to Andrews for Bodacious' grave.  Progeny  Bodacious sired many progeny that competed in the PRCA and PBR. These included bulls such as Bo's Excuse, Erks Me, and Fender Bender. On June 6, 2008, four of his sons performed throughout the weekend at the Rodeo Killeen, in Killeen, Texas, in its 61st year at the time. Those sons included Red Onion, Pull the Trigger, and Fender Bender. Each of those bulls lived at Andrews' ranch at the time. Bodacious also sired Bo Howdy, who debuted in 2002 as a PBR bull. One of Bodacious' most successful sons is a bull that Andrews bred who is competing as of 2017. His name is Midnight Bender, and Andrews is bucking him on the PRCA circuit. The bull won the PRCA Bucking Bull of the Year title in 2016. \\"Midnight Bender does not have a reputation of injuring and alienating cowboys. But like Bodacious, Midnight Bender bucks with an attitude and some altitude\\". According to Andrews, the bull spends a lot of time in the air and kicks hard. The bull gives quite a show when he bucks, and the riders all like him. At times the bull is reminiscent of Bodacious in some of his movements, even the difficult ones. But Andrews claims this bull is rideable. ProBullStats as of May 2017 shows the bull has 32 attempts with 6 rides. Another successful son of Bodacious is Beaver Creek Beau, owned by Chad Berger Bucking Bulls and partners, who has been bucking on the elite BFTS circuit since 2013. He ranked in the top 20 on the BFTS in 2016 and was very close to being a world champion bull contender. At all levels, he's been ridden 8 times of 98 attempts. At the BFTS level, he's been ridden 6 times out of 60 outs as of mid-2017. Beau is a sizable bull, like his sire, weighing in around . He isn't quite as fast as his sire, but he's fast enough to be a Championship round bull. In 2002, the PRCA awarded the Andrews Rodeo Company the Stock Contractor of the Year award. His ability to produce quality stock is earmarked by his hall of fame bull, Bodacious, and his history of producing great bucking stock, both bulls and broncs.Stock Contractors, p. 640. In 2008, the Texas Rodeo Cowboy Hall of Fame inducted Sammy Andrews.  Breeding  H. D. Page rode, bred, and hauled Bodacious' progeny. This gave him a bit of unique insight into the bull. He was initially unimpressed, but then he saw some very good progeny, especially from his daughters. Page also understands what it takes to promote a sire, and points out that Bob Tallman promoted Bodacious better than anyone. Some of Page's bulls which he has bred from Bo's daughters have been BFTS bulls, for example, 77 Hustler. Tallman trademarked Bodacious's name, and he says he did it because he believes in the bull. He says \\"We registered his likeness and created an icon.\\" That icon still exists today. He believes that the quality of bulls like Bodacious changed bull riding. When Bodacious retired, stock contractors and Tallman started pondering the question of how to continue raising that quality of bulls. In 1992, Tallman and Andrews were venting about dishonest bull breeders \\"who advertised bulls by famous sires like Oscar or Red Rock, when in actuality the bulls came from some obscure sale barn\\". Naturally buyers were refusing to pay top dollar for bulls whose sires and lineage could not be verified. Andrews believed a verifiable bloodline was necessary in order to garner the trust of buyers. Tallman had studied genetics and had incorporated it into his own breeding program. So in 1996 he and a partner started Buckers, Inc. It used DNA testing to verify a bull's parentage. Bodacious became the test case for this model: \\"every stock contractor in the business wanted a bull as rank as Bodacious--especially if they were certain the calf was a legitimate son\\". Buckers registered and certified records of Bodacious' progeny resulting from semen collection. They also started collecting other top bulls' semen too. By 2003, Buckers had 11,000 cattle registered. Randy Bernard at the PBR was so impressed that he bought out Buckers and renamed the company to American Bucking Bull. He sold 19 shares of the ABBI for $25,000 apiece. The first bucking bull registered on the ABBI is Bodacious as he is the first bull in the Buckers, Inc., database. His ABBI registration number is 1000078. When Bodacious died in 2000, he had 23 sons who had professional outs. This earned him the top spot on the all-time producing sire's list at that time.  Legacy  Bodacious became infamously known as \\"the world's most dangerous bull\\" throughout the sport of bull riding and beyond due to his reputation for injuring riders. Hedeman is the bull rider known to have received the worst injuries from Bodacious, with Breding and West being runners-up. Hedeman and Breding were injured towards the end of Bodacious' career in 1995. But at the same time, he became known as \\"the greatest bull ever to buck.\\" \\"Of all the bulls I've ever seen, he's the most dangerous,\\" Hedeman once told a Sports Illustrated reporter. Throughout Bodacious' career, hall of fame rodeo announcer Bob Tallman referred to him as \\"the yellow whale\\" due to his color and size. > Hedeman once said \\"even top-ranked guys who weren‚Äôt afraid of anything were > definitely afraid of Bodacious.\\" A ride of the giant that didn‚Äôt end with > injury was a successful ride. Bodacious was such a powerhouse it wasn‚Äôt > uncommon to see his belly from the top of the back of the chute ‚Äì and if you > can imagine being tied to something nearly a ton dropping even five feet > then changing directions ‚Äì and you don‚Äôt know what direction ‚Äì you can > imagine a very small glimpse of him. He was able to buck many off before > they could nod their heads The key to this was that Bodacious was such a skilled jumper he could jump higher than the top bar of the chute, resulting in many riders being bucked off on the first jump. \\"Bo's first jump when he left the chute resembled a roller coaster ride,\\" says Andrews' wife Caroline. \\"Bodacious could kick and roll and he learned how to unseat a rider. Bodacious really liked to get in the air. And every time he jumped, he usually brought a bull rider forward,\\" putting riders in position to injure them with his head. On January 23, 2013, the PBR published an article about the greatest bulls where they took a survey of bull riding fans and the two most mentioned bulls were Bodacious and Little Yellow Jacket. On June 29, 2015, the PBR published an article about the memorable bulls of the PBR and listed Bodacious \\"as one of the most famous bulls of all time.\\" He and Bushwacker are similar in terms of popularity. The ProRodeo Hall of Fame chose Bodacious in 1999 as their sixth member; there are only seven bulls inducted as of 2017. Bo joins such exceptional bulls as Skoal Pacific Bell, Red Rock, Oscar, and Jim Shoulders' Tornado. Mostly, those bulls had long careers. However, Bo's short professional career lasted only four years. In that time, he bucked off 127 of 135 riders. Bryan McDonald, the PRCA bull riding director who sets the pens for the NFR, commented that Bo was ranker than any of those bulls. \\"Pacific Bell could hook the crap out of you. Mr. T and Red Rock, they were both smart and wouldn't hurt anyone. Bodacious, he was murderous.\\" In 2017, the Bull Riding Hall of Fame inducted Bodacious, joining Tornado in another hall of fame and the bull known only by his brand, V-61. In 1994 and 1995, the top cowboys voted him as the PRCA Bucking Bull of the Year. In 1992, '94, and '95, he was elected Bucking Bull of the NFR.ProRodeo Awards Stock of the Year, p. 563.

Aptheker was active in civil rights and anti-war movements of the 1960s and 1970s, and has since worked in developing feminist studies. Biography =Early years and education= Aptheker was born in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to a Jewish family,Jewish Journal: \\"So many authors, so little time\\" by Naomi Pfefferman September 14, 2006 Fay Philippa Aptheker and Herbert Aptheker, first cousins who had married in Brooklyn. Both parents were political activists; her mother, who had been married before and was ten years older than her husband, was a union organizer. Her father was a Marxist historian, whose first book about slave revolts overturned previous conceptions of enslaved African Americans. He was a major figure in changing the writing of African American history. Bettina was raised in Brooklyn, New York, where her Jewish parents, children of immigrants, had grown up. Her first job as a teenager was in the home of W.E.B. Du Bois, who was a good friend of her father. Aptheker obtained her undergraduate degree from the University of California, Berkeley. As an activist in the W.E.B. Du Bois Club of the Communist Party USA, she was a leader in the Berkeley Free Speech Movement during the fall of 1964. Ten years later, she partially retired from political activism and returned to academia for graduate work. In 1976 she completed her master's degree in communications at San Jose State University, and started teaching there. Cover of Aptheker's May 1968 pamphlet, Columbia Inc. =Political career= Aptheker was a delegate to the June 1964 founding convention of the W.E.B. DuBois Clubs, a Communist Party-sponsored youth organization, held in San Francisco.Francis X. Gannon, Biographical Dictionary of the Left: Volume II. Boston: Western Islands, 1971; pp. 182‚Äì183. She rose in influence to become a member of the governing National Committee of the CPUSA. She was remembered by the California party leader Dorothy Healey in her 1990 memoir as \\"one of the liveliest of the young people who rose to prominence in the party in the 1960s and also one of the warmest human beings I've ever met.\\"Dorothy Healey and Maurice Isserman, Dorothy Healey Remembers: A Life in the American Communist Party. New York: Oxford University Press, 1990; p. 233. In 1968, the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia divided the 120-member leadership of the CPUSA. All but three of the National Committee, headed by party leader Gus Hall, backed the intervention of Soviet tanks. A meeting of the National Committee held over the Labor Day weekend backed Hall by a margin of five-to-one. Bettina Aptheker denounced the invasion, however, and voted with the minority; she opposed her father Herbert Aptheker over this issue. One of the CPUSA's leading intellectuals, he and a majority of its leaders had defended the Soviet intervention in Hungary in 1956. During the 1970s, Aptheker worked for the defense in the high-profile trial of Angela Davis, a long-time friend and fellow Communist Party member accused of involvement in George Jackson's attempt to escape from jail. She also wrote a book about the trial, which was published in 1974. In 1977, she became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. =Academic career= After completing her master's degree, Aptheker taught African-American and Women's Studies at San Jos√© State University. In the early 1980s, she completed a doctorate in the History of Consciousness program at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Since 1980, she has taught in the Feminist Studies department there. =Marriage and family= In 1965 Aptheker married her fellow student Jack Kurzweil, who was also a Communist activist. They divorced in 1978 after having two children together. Since October 1979, Aptheker has been with Kate Miller, her life partner. They have three children between them, as each woman had children in her first marriage. About her father In her memoir, Intimate Politics, (2006), she wrote about growing up in a leftist household, as what was called a \\"Red Diaper Baby.\\" She was strongly influenced in her activism by that of her parents. She also commented on her father's scholarship. In addition to his commitment to the cause of justice for African Americans, she believed her father celebrated black resistance under slavery as an attempt \\"to compensate for his deep shame about the way, he believed, the Jews had acted during the Holocaust.\\" Her memoir reported that her father had sexually molested her from when she was 3 to age 13. In an opinion column written after her book was reviewed, Aptheker said she had earlier kept silent to shield her family.Bettina Aptheker, \\"'Did I ever hurt you when you were a child?'\\", Los Angeles Times, 15 October 2006, accessed 19 January 2012 Memories began to arise in 1999, after her mother's death and when she began writing the memoir. When her father asked, \\"Did I ever hurt you as a child?,\\" she responded \\"yes\\" and explained the emotional effects of his treatment. He expressed anguish and sorrow, and they eventually reconciled. With counseling, she found she had suffered dissociation when young, as at the time her family was under great stress during the McCarthy years. Bettina Aptheker stressed her compassion for her father. Her assertion generated considerable controversy in the academic community because of her father's stature as a scholar and Communist. Numerous letters were published in The Chronicle of Higher Education, which had reviewed her book, and on the History News Network of George Mason University.\\"Search: Bettina and Herbert Aptheker\\", History News Network, 61 responses Some historians wondered how this news affected people's perceptions of Herbert Aptheker's work. Others questioned Bettina Aptheker's credibility, classing her account in stories of \\"recovered memory.\\" The historian Mark Rosenzweig wrote, \\"the truth about Herbert and Bettina is inaccessible to us.\\" The historian Jesse Lemisch wrote in his second essay about the controversy, \\"Shhh! Don't Talk about Herbert Aptheker\\": The controversy continued for months. In November 2007, the historian Christopher Phelps published an overview. He included the results of an interview with Kate Miller, who had been present during Aptheker's 1999 conversation with her father about the abuse, and confirmed her account.Christopher Phelps, \\"Herbert Aptheker: His daughter's partner confirms molestation charge\\", The Nation, 5 November 2007, reprinted at History News Network, accessed 18 January 2012  Works  = Books = * Big Business and the American University.

Music career She grew up in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and now lives in Massachusetts. McKeown began her career in the folk scene. She released her first album, Monday Morning Cold in 1999 on her own label (TVP Records), travelling throughout New England while a student at Brown University in order to promote the record. Although she had begun studying ornithology, she graduated from Brown with a degree in ethnomusicology. Early in her career, she collaborated with Beth Amsel, Jess Klein, and Rose Polenzani; the four of them performed as Voices on the Verge. McKeown's 2005 album, We Will Become Like Birds (produced by Tucker Martine), served as a departure from her earlier work, with a more rock-oriented sound. At a September 1, 2008, concert at The Gravity Lounge in Charlottesville, Virginia, McKeown told the audience that she wrote this album \\"in an attempt to write myself out of the worst heartache I'd experienced up to that point.\\" Her next studio release, Sing You Sinners, was released in Europe on the 23 October 2006 and in the United States on January 9, 2007 by Nettwerk. It consists mostly of covers of jazz standards from the 1920s through 1950s. McKeown's record, Hundreds of Lions, was released under Righteous Babe Records on October 13, 2009. McKeown is currently member of an unsigned band known as \\"emma\\", which she created with her friend Allison Miller.emma on MySpace Music McKeown has plans to write a book of poetry.interview in Lesbilicious magazine McKeown released \\"Manifestra\\" on January 15, 2013.

Profile  Prof. Christos Pantelis is an Australian of Greek background. He completed his medical degree at the University of Melbourne and trained at St Vincent's Hospital in Melbourne. Two years later, in 1979, he commenced his training in psychiatry at the Royal Free Hospital in London, England. During his training, he spent 18 months as a Research Registrar at University College Hospital to undertake an epidemiological study of schizophrenia in Inner London. He was appointed as a lecturer at Charing Cross & Westminster Medical School (UK) in 1988. In this position, he worked in the Academic Unit at Horton and the Gordon Hospitals, headed by Professor Thomas R.E. Barnes. The unit was involved in a number of research studies in schizophrenia including phenomenology, psychopharmacology, studies on movement disorder, neuropsychological aspects of schizophrenia, as well as epidemiology and social psychiatric aspects of schizophrenia. In 1992, he was awarded the Lilly Travelling Fellowship of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the King Edward's Hospital Fund for London, England. During this year, he was Travelling Research Fellow with the National Institute of Mental Health (Washington, DC), where he worked with Dr. Richard Coppola and Dr. Daniel Weinberger, developing a technique for volumetric analysis of brain MRI images. He then returned briefly to the UK as a Research Fellow. After his return from England at the end of 1992, Prof. Christos Pantelis worked at the Mental Health Research Institute and at Royal Park Psychiatric Hospital. He established the Cognitive Neuropsychiatry Research Unit, which is now based at both the Mental Health Research Institute and Sunshine Hospital. He also heads the Academic Unit at Sunshine Hospital. He became a Fellow of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists in 1999. Prof. Pantelis was Director of the inpatient rehabilitation program at Royal Park Hospital until mid-1996. During this time, he was responsible for the inpatient rehabilitation program and was instrumental in developing a comprehensive Model of Care for patients with long-term mental illness, and establishing a region-wide coordinating committee to oversee developments in delivery of services to these patients. He is currently Clinical Director and Principal Specialist for the Adult Mental Health Rehabilitation Unit (AMHRU) at Sunshine Hospital. This is a 26-beds unit for patients with treatment-resistant psychoses. He was actively involved in planning the movement of the Rehabilitation Unit to Sunshine Hospital and in the establishment of an Academic and Research Unit at that site. This included providing expertise into the architectural design of the new clinical and research units. These units opened in early 2000.  Achievements  Prof. Christos Pantelis has established an internationally recognised group in the field of schizophrenia research, particularly in the neuropsychology and neuroimaging of the disorder. He has published numerous papers in peer reviewed journals, including papers in the Archives of General Psychiatry, as well as recent papers in Brain, Brain Research Reviews, Psychological Medicine, and other international journals. He has published a book on schizophrenia from a neuropsychological perspective. He is highly experienced in the application of both structural and functional brain imaging to psychiatric disorders and has been awarded a number of NH & MRC grants, as well as a major imaging grant from the Ian Potter Foundation. He is also a member of the NH & MRC Brain Network. This work has been internationally recognised with invited talks to the UK and Europe. He is part of an international group looking at the neurobiology of schizophrenia. This work was presented at a number of invited symposia in Europe and USA. His most recent work challenges the current neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia in showing progressive changes in this disorder. In particular they have demonstrated that brain structural abnormalities are occurring during the transition phase to psychosis in individuals at high risk for developing schizophrenia.

It is a popular cage bird, and in aviculture it is known as the golden song sparrow. The Arabian golden sparrow and this species are sometimes considered one species, as the \\"golden sparrow\\". Taxonomy and systematics From left to right, the mostly yellow Arabian golden sparrow, the Sudan golden sparrow, which is yellow with a brown back, and the brown chestnut sparrow This species was first described by Martin Lichtenstein in 1823, as Fringilla lutea, from a specimen collected at Dongola, Sudan. Since then it has generally been placed in the genus Passer. The species name luteus means saffron yellow in Latin. The two golden sparrows are very similar, and have often been treated as the same species. Both are similar to the chestnut sparrow, and all three may once have been only clinally different. The male Arabian golden sparrow is almost entirely gold- coloured, the male chestnut sparrow is mostly chestnut, and the male Sudan golden sparrow is intermediate. British ornithologist Richard Meinertzhagen considered even the chestnut sparrow to be conspecific, though the range of the Sudan golden sparrow overlaps with that of the chestnut sparrow without any known interbreeding in a small area of Darfur. The three species are similar in their behaviour, which is adapted to the unpredictable conditions of their arid habitat. In particular, they and the Dead Sea sparrow share a courtship display in which males quiver their wings above their body. This intense display is probably an adaptation to nesting in a clump of trees surrounded by similar habitat, where such an intense display may serve important purposes in keeping a colony together. The golden sparrows and chestnut sparrow have been seen as highly primitive among the genus Passer, only distantly related to the house sparrow and the related \\"Palaearctic black-bibbed sparrows\\". In recognition of this they are sometimes placed in a separate genus or subgenus Auripasser, or a superspecies. The courtship display of the Dead Sea sparrow was thought to have evolved separately in a similar environment from that of these species, in an example of convergent evolution. However, studies of sparrow mitochondrial DNA indicate that these species are either derived from or are the closest relatives of the Palaearctic black-bibbed sparrows.  Description  A flock with males and females near the Red Sea in Sudan The Sudan golden sparrow is a smaller sparrow, at in length, with a wingspan of . Males are distinctive in their bright yellow head and underparts, deep chestnut brown wings and back, and two white wingbars. In the breeding season the male's plumage is brighter still, and the bill changes colour from horn to shiny black. Females are pale sandy- buff with yellowish face, light brown wings, a back faintly streaked with chestnut, and pale yellow fading to whitish on the underparts. Juveniles are similar to females, but greyer. About 10 weeks after hatching young males may start to get a yellow wash around the shoulder area. Its basic call is a chirp or tchirrup, similar to that of other sparrows. Variations include a song-like call, and a rapid rhythmic che-che-che.  Distribution and habitat  A male near the Red Sea in Sudan It breeds across Africa to the south of the Sahara from Senegal east to Sudan and Ethiopia. In April 2009 a flock of seven was found to the north-west of Aousserd, Morocco. Two birds were seen in 2013 and a few more in 2014. It is a bird of dry open savanna, semi-desert, arid scrub and cereal cultivation.  Behaviour and ecology  The Sudan golden sparrow is a highly gregarious and nomadic bird and will form mixed flocks with other seed-eating birds, such as red-billed quelea, and other sparrows. Evening roosts, often in cities like Khartoum, may number hundreds of thousands of birds. It eats seeds and takes some insects, especially when feeding young. It prefers grass seeds, including smaller cereal seeds, such as those of millet. In captivity it is fed the mixture of foxtail millet and other grains with vegetables, mealworms, and other supplements usually fed to weavers. It breeds in very large colonies, of as many as 65,000 nests. The nest is a very large, untidy, domed built of twigs made in tree branches, with a feather-lined nest chamber. One or two clutches a year are laid, typically of three or four eggs. Eggs are white with dark spots.

Infants start without knowing a language, yet by 10 months, babies can distinguish speech sounds and engage in babbling. Some research has shown that the earliest learning begins in utero when the fetus starts to recognize the sounds and speech patterns of its mother's voice and differentiate them from other sounds after birth. Typically, children develop receptive language abilities before their verbal or expressive language develops. Receptive language is the internal processing and understanding of language. As receptive language continues to increase, expressive language begins to slowly develop. Usually, productive language is considered to begin with a stage of pre-verbal communication in which infants use gestures and vocalizations to make their intents known to others. According to a general principle of development, new forms then take over old functions, so that children learn words to express the same communicative functions they had already expressed by proverbial means. Theoretical frameworks Language development is thought to proceed by ordinary processes of learning in which children acquire the forms, meanings, and uses of words and utterances from the linguistic input. Children often begin reproducing the words that they are repetitively exposed to. The method in which we develop language skills is universal; however, the major debate is how the rules of syntax are acquired. There are two major approaches to syntactic development, an empiricist account by which children learn all syntactic rules from the linguistic input, and a nativist approach by which some principles of syntax are innate and are transmitted through the human genome. The nativist theory, proposed by Noam Chomsky, argues that language is a unique human accomplishment, and can be attributed to either \\"millions of years of evolution\\" or to \\"principles of neural organization that may be even more deeply grounded in physical law\\". Chomsky says that all children have what is called an innate language acquisition device (LAD). Theoretically, the LAD is an area of the brain that has a set of universal syntactic rules for all languages. This device provides children with the ability to make sense of knowledge and construct novel sentences with minimal external input and little experience. Chomsky's claim is based upon the view that what children hear‚Äîtheir linguistic input‚Äîis insufficient to explain how they come to learn language. He argues that linguistic input from the environment is limited and full of errors. Therefore, nativists assume that it is impossible for children to learn linguistic information solely from their environment. However, because children possess this LAD, they are in fact, able to learn language despite incomplete information from their environment. Their capacity to learn language is also attributed to the theory of universal grammar (UG), which posits that a certain set of structural rules are innate to humans, independent of sensory experience. This view has dominated linguistic theory for over fifty years and remains highly influential, as witnessed by the number of articles in journals and books. The empiricist theory suggests, contra Chomsky, that there is enough information in the linguistic input children receive and therefore, there is no need to assume an innate language acquisition device exists (see above). Rather than a LAD evolved specifically for language, empiricists believe that general brain processes are sufficient enough for language acquisition. During this process, it is necessary for the child to actively engage with their environment. For a child to learn language, the parent or caregiver adopts a particular way of appropriately communicating with the child; this is known as child-directed speech (CDS). CDS is used so that children are given the necessary linguistic information needed for their language. Empiricism is a general approach and sometimes goes along with the interactionist approach. Statistical language acquisition, which falls under empiricist theory, suggests that infants acquire language by means of pattern perception. Other researchers embrace an interactionist perspective, consisting of social-interactionist theories of language development. In such approaches, children learn language in the interactive and communicative context, learning language forms for meaningful moves of communication. These theories focus mainly on the caregiver's attitudes and attentiveness to their children in order to promote productive language habits. An older empiricist theory, the behaviorist theory proposed by B. F. Skinner suggested that language is learned through operant conditioning, namely, by imitation of stimuli and by reinforcement of correct responses. This perspective has not been widely accepted at any time, but by some accounts, is experiencing a resurgence. New studies use this theory now to treat individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders. Additionally, Relational Frame Theory is growing from the behaviorist theory, which is important for Acceptance and Commitment Therapy.Roediger, R. (2004) \\"What happened to Behaviorism.\\" American Psychological Society. Some empiricist theory accounts today use behaviorist models. Other relevant theories about language development include Piaget's theory of cognitive development, which considers the development of language as a continuation of general cognitive development and Vygotsky's social theories that attribute the development of language to an individual's social interactions and growth. Biological preconditions Evolutionary biologists are skeptical of the claim that syntactic knowledge is transmitted in the human genome. However, many researchers claim that the ability to acquire such a complicated system is unique to the human species. Non-biologists also tend to believe that our ability to learn spoken language may have been developed through the evolutionary process and that the foundation for language may be passed down genetically. The ability to speak and understand human language requires speech production skills and abilities as well as multisensory integration of sensory processing abilities. One hotly debated issue is whether the biological contribution includes capacities specific to language acquisition, often referred to as universal grammar. For fifty years, linguist Noam Chomsky has argued for the hypothesis that children have innate, language-specific abilities that facilitate and constrain language learning. In particular, he has proposed that humans are biologically prewired to learn language at a certain time and in a certain way, arguing that children are born with a language acquisition device (LAD). However, since he developed the minimalist program, his latest version of theory of syntactic structure, Chomsky has reduced the elements of universal grammar, which he believes are prewired in humans to just the principle of recursion, thus voiding most of the nativist endeavor. Researchers who believe that grammar is learned rather than innate, have hypothesized that language learning results from general cognitive abilities and the interaction between learners and their human interactants. It has also recently been suggested that the relatively slow development of the prefrontal cortex in humans may be one reason that humans are able to learn language, whereas other species are not. Further research has indicated the influence of the FOXP2 gene. Stages Relationship between interpersonal communication and the stages of development. The greatest development of language occurs in the stage of infancy. As the child matures, the rate of language development decreases. 0-1 years of age: :An infant mainly uses non- verbal communication (mostly gestures) to communicate. For a newborn, crying is the only means of communication. Infants 1-5 months old have different tones of crying that indicate their emotions. Infants also begin laughing at this stage. At 6-7 months old, infants begin to respond to their own name, yell and squeal, and distinguish emotions based on the tone of voice of the mother and father. Between 7 and 10 months the infant starts putting words together, for example \\"mama\\" and \\"dada\\", but these words lack meaning and significance. Verbal communication begins at approximately 10-12 months, and the child starts to imitate any sounds they hear, for example animal sounds. The non-verbal communication of infants includes the use of gaze, head orientation and body positioning. Gestures are also widely used as an act of communication. All these stages can be delayed if the parents do not communicate with their infant on a daily basis. :Nonverbal communication begins with the comprehension of parents and how they use it effectively in conversation. Infants are able to break down what adults and others are saying to them and use their comprehension of this communication to produce their own. 1‚Äì2 years of age: :Verbal and nonverbal communication are both used at this stage of development. At 12 months, children start to repeat the words they hear. Adults, especially parents, are used as a point of reference for children in terms of the sound of words and what they mean in context of the conversation. Children learn much of their verbal communication through repetition and observing others. If parents do not speak to their children at this age it can become quite difficult for them to learn the essentials of conversation. The vocabulary of a 1‚Äì2 year old should consist of 50 words and can be up to 500. Gestures that were used earlier on in development begin to be replaced by words and eventually are only used when needed. Verbal communication is chosen over nonverbal as development progresses. 2‚Äì3 years of age: :Children aged 2‚Äì3 communicate best in a turn-taking style. This creates a conversational structure that makes it easier for verbal communication to develop. It also teaches patience, kindness, and respect as they learn from the direction of elders that one person should speak at a time. This creates interactional synchrony during their preverbal routines that shapes their interpersonal communication skills early on in their development.Haslett, B., & Samter, W. (1997). Developing verbal communication. In Children communicating: The first 5 years. Mahwah, N.J.: Erlbaum. Children during this stage in their life also go through a recognition and continuity phase. Children start to see that shared awareness is a factor in communication along with their development of symbolic direction of language. This especially affects the relationship between the child and the caregiver; it is a crucial part of self-discovery for the child when they begin to take ownership over their own actions in a continuous manner. 3‚Äì5 years of age: :In this age group children are still learning how to form abstract thoughts and are still communicating concretely. Children begin to be fluent in connecting sounds, syllables, and linking words that make sense together in one thought. They begin to participate in short conversations with others. Stuttering can develop, generally resulting in slowed-down speech with a few letter enunciation errors (f, v, s, z).Ateah, Christine A.; Kyle, Terri; Scott, Shannon D. (2008). Canadian Essentials of Pediatric Nursing. China: Wolters Kluwer Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. pp. 82‚Äì84, 108‚Äì109, 136‚Äì137, 160, 183. . At the beginning of this stage toddlers tend to be missing function words and misunderstand how to use verb tenses.Over time they start including functional words, pronouns, and auxiliary verbs. This is the stage at which most children can pick up on emotional cues of the tone of adults' conversation. If negative feedback is distinguished by the child, this ends with fear and avoidance of the associated verbal and nonverbal cues. Toddlers develop the skills to listen and partially understand what another person is saying and can develop an appropriate response. 5‚Äì10 years of age: :Much language development during this time period takes place in a school setting. At the beginning of the school age years, a child‚Äôs vocabulary expands through exposure to reading, which also helps children to learn more difficult grammatical forms, including plurals and pronouns. They also begin to develop metalinguistic awareness which allows them to reflect and more clearly understand the language they use. They therefore start to understand jokes and riddles. Reading is a gateway for learning new vernacular and having confidence in complex word choices while talking with adults. This is an important developmental stage socially and physiologically for the child.Strom, R., Bernard, H., & Strom, S. (1987). Fostering effective communication. In Human Development and Learning (pp. 270-278). New York, NY: Human Sciences Press. School-aged children can easily be influenced through communication and gestures. As children continue to learn communication, they realize the difference between forms of intentions and understand that there are numerous different ways to express the same intent, with different meaning. 10‚Äì18 years of age: :By the age of 10, the child's cognitive potential has matured and they can participate fully and understand the purpose of their conversations. During this time, the sophistication and effectiveness of communication skills increase and understanding of vocabulary and grammar increases as a result of education. Adolescents go through changes in social interactions and cognitive development that influence the way they communicate.Smith, Martine (March 2005). \\"AAC: Augmentative & Alternative Communication\\". The Dual Challenges of Aided Communication and Adolescence. Vol. 21 (1): 67-79. Retrieved 28 September 2014. They often use colloquial speech (slang), however, which can increase confusion and misunderstandings. An individual‚Äôs style of interpersonal communication depends on who they are communicating with. Their relationships change influencing how they communicate with others. During this period, adolescents tend to communicate less with their parents and more with their friends. When discussions are initiated in different channels of communication, attitude and predispositions are key factors that drive the individual to discuss their feelings. This also shows that respect in communication is a trait in interpersonal communication that is built on throughout development. The end of this adolescent stage is the basis for communication in the adult stage. Gender differences =Children versus adults= Language development and processing begins before birth. Evidence has shown that there is language development occurring antepartum. DeCasper and Spence performed a study in 1986 by having mothers read aloud during the last few weeks of pregnancy. When the infants were born, they were then tested. They were read aloud a story while sucking on a pacifier; the story was either the story read by the mother when the infant was in utero or a new story. The pacifier used was able to determine the rate of sucking that the infant was performing. When the story that the mother had read before was heard, the sucking of the pacifier was modified. This did not occur during the story that the infant had not heard before. The results for this experiment had shown that the infants were able to recognize what they had heard in utero, providing insight that language development had been occurring in the last six weeks of pregnancy. Throughout the first year of life, infants are unable to communicate with language. Instead, infants communicate with gestures. This phenomenon is known as prelinguistic gestures, which are nonverbal ways that infants communicate that also had a plan backed with the gesture. Examples of these could be pointing at an object, tugging on the shirt of a parent to get the parent's attention, etc. Harding, 1983, devised the major criteria that come along with the behavior of prelinguistic gestures and their intent to communicate. There are three major criteria that go along with a prelinguistic gesture: waiting, persistence, and ultimately, development of alternative plans. This process usually occurs around 8 months of age, where an appropriate scenario may be of a child tugging on the shirt of a parent to wait for the attention of the parent who would then notice the infant, which causes the infant to point to something they desire. This would describe the first two criteria. The development of alternative plans may arise if the parent does not acknowledge what the infant wants, the infant may entertain itself to satisfy the previous desire. When children reach about 15‚Äì18 months of age, language acquisition flourishes. There is a surge in word production resulting from the growth of the cortex. Infants begin to learn the words that form a sentence and within the sentence, the word endings can be interpreted. Elissa Newport and colleagues (1999) found that humans learn first about the sounds of a language, and then move on to how to speak the language. This shows how infants learn the end of a word and know that a new word is being spoken. From this step, infants are then able to determine the structure of a language and word. It appears that during the early years of language development females exhibit an advantage over males of the same age. When infants between the age of 16 to 22 months were observed interacting with their mothers, a female advantage was obvious. The females in this age range showed more spontaneous speech production than the males and this finding was not due to mothers speaking more with daughters than sons. In addition, boys between 2 and 6 years as a group did not show higher performance in language development over their girl counterparts on experimental assessments. In studies using adult populations, 18 and over, it seems that the female advantage may be task dependent. Depending on the task provided, a female advantage may or may not be present. Similarly, one study found that out of the 5.5% of American children with language impairments, 7.2% are male, and 3.8% are female. There are many different suggested explanations for this gender gap in language impairment prevalence. =Lateralization effect on language= It is currently believed that in regards to brain lateralization males are left-lateralized, while females are bilateralized. Studies on patients with unilateral lesions have provided evidence that females are in fact more bilateralized with their verbal abilities. It seems that when a female has experienced a lesion to the left hemisphere, she is better able to compensate for this damage than a male can. If a male has a lesion in the left hemisphere, his verbal abilities are greatly impaired in comparison to a control male of the same age without that damage. However, these results may also be task-dependent as well as time-dependent. = Fine motor development rate = Shriberg, Tomblin, and McSweeny (1999) suggest that the fine motor skills necessary for correct speech may develop more slowly in males. This could explain why some of the language impairments in young males seems to spontaneously improve over time. = Over diagnosis = It is also suggested that the gender gap in language impairment prevalence could also be explained by the clinical over diagnosis of males. Males tend to be clinically over diagnosed with a variety of disorders. = Visibility = The study by Shriber et al. (1999) further explains that this gap in the prevalence of language impairment could be because males tend to be more visible. These researchers reveal that male children tend to act out behaviorally when they have any sort of disorder, while female children tend to turn inward and develop emotional disorders as well. Thus, the high ratio of males with language impairments may be connected with the fact that males are more visible, and thus more often diagnosed. Writing development Research in writing development has been limited in psychology.Christie, F., & Derewianka, B. (2010). School discourse: Learning to write across the years of schooling. Bloomsbury Publishing. In the research that has been conducted, focus has generally centred on the development of written and spoken language and their connection. Spoken and written skills could be considered linked. Researchers believe that children's spoken language influences their written language.Kroll, B. M. (1981) Developmental relationships between speaking and writing. In Kroll & Vaan (eds) (1981), 32‚Äì54 When a child learns to write they need to master letter formation, spelling, punctuation and they also have to gain an understanding of the structure and the organisational patterns involved in written language.Perera, K. (1984). Children's writing and reading: Analysing classroom language. Oxford: Blackwell. Kroll's theory is one of the most significant on children's writing development. He proposed that children's writing development is split into 4 phases. Kroll explicitly states that these phases are 'artificial' in the sense that the boundaries between the phases are imprecise and he recognises that each child is different, thus their development is unique. The phases of writing development have been highlighted to give the reader a broad outline of what phases a child goes through during writing development; however when studying an individual's development in depth, the phases may be disregarded to an extent. The first of Kroll's phases is the preparation for writing phase. In this phase the child is believed to grasp the technical skills needed for writing, allowing them to create the letters needed to write the words the children say. In this initial phase children experience many opportunities to extend their spoken language skills. Speaking and writing are considered fairly separate processes here, as children's writing is less well developed at this stage, whereas their spoken language is becoming more skilled. Kroll considers the second phase in writing development to be consolidation. Here, children begin to consolidate spoken and written language. In this phase children's writing skills rely heavily on their spoken language skills, and their written and spoken language becoming integrated. Children's written language skills become stronger as they use their spoken language skills to improve their writing. Then in turn, when a development in children's written language skills is seen, their spoken language skills have also improved. A child's written language in this phase mirrors their spoken language. In the third phase, differentiation, children begin to learn that written language regularly differs in structure and style from spoken language. The growth from consolidation to differentiation can be challenging for some children to grasp. Children can 'struggle with the transformation from the basically overt language of speech to the essentially covert activity of writing'.Petty 1978 Petty, W. T. The writing of young children. In C. R. Cooper & L. Odell (Eds.), Research on composing: Points of departure. Urbana, Il.: NCTE, 1978. In this phase, the child learns that writing is generally considered more formal than spoken language, which is thought to be casual and conversational. Here, it is believed that children begin to understand that writing serves a purpose.Kroll, B. M. (1981) Developmental relationships between speaking and writing. In Kroll & Vaan (eds) (1981), 32‚Äì54. Kroll considers the last phase to be the systematic integration phase. A differentiation and integration between the child's speaking and writing can be seen in this phase. This means that speaking and writing have 'well-articulated forms and functions'; however, they are also integrated in the sense that they use the same system. As a result of the individual being aware of the audience, context and reason they are communicating, both written and spoken language are able to overlap and take several forms at this stage. Kroll used the four phases to give an explanation and generalise about the development of these two aspects of language. The highest significance is placed on the second and third phase, consolidation and differentiation respectively. It could be concluded that children's written and spoken language, in certain respects, become more similar to age, maturation, and experience; however, they are also increasingly different in other respects. The content of the skills are more similar, but the approach used for both writing and speaking are different. When writing and speaking development is looked at more closely it can be seen that certain elements of written and spoken language are differentiating and other elements are integrating, all in the same phase. Perera conducted a survey and her view mirrors that of Kroll to the extent that she used Kroll's four phases. When a child undergoes initial learning of the written language, they have not yet fully mastered the oral language. It is clear that their written language development is aided by their spoken language; it can also be said that their spoken language development is aided by the development of their written language skills. Kantor and Rubin believe that not all individuals successfully move into the final stage of integration.Kantor, K. J. & Rubin, D. L. (1981) Between speaking and writing: processes of differentiation. In Kroll & Vaan (eds) (1981), 55‚Äì81. Perera is also aware that it is hard to assign chronological ages to each phase of writing development, because each child is an individual, and also the phases are 'artificial'. Other than Kroll's theory, there are four principles on early patterns in writing development discussed by Marie Clay in her book What Did I Write?. The four principles are recurring principle, the generative principle, the sign principle, and the inventory principle. The recurring principle involves patterns and shapes in English writing that develop throughout writing development. The generative principle incorporates the idea that a writer can create new meanings by organizing units of writing and letters of the alphabet. The sign principle is understanding that the word print also involves paper arrangement and word boundaries. And lastly, the inventory principle is the fact that children have the urge to list and name items that they are familiar with, and because of this they can practice their own writing skills. More recent research has also explored writing development. Myhill concentrated on the development of written language skills in adolescents aged 13 to 15. Myhill discovered that the more mature writer was aware of the shaping of text, and used non-finite clauses, which mirrored Perera's results (1984). Other researchers focused on writing development up until late adolescence, as there has been a limited research in this area. Chrisite and Derewianke recognize that the survey conducted by Perera (1984) is still one of the most significant research studies in the writing development field and believe Perera's study is similar to theirs. Chrisite and Derewianke (2010) again propose four phases of writing development. The researchers believe that the process of writing development does not stop when an individual leaves formal education, and again, the researchers highlight that these phases are flexible in their onset. The first phase focuses on spoken language as the main aid for writing development, and the development then takes its course reaching the fourth phase, which continues beyond formal education. Environmental influences The environment a child develops in has influences on language development. The environment provides language input for the child to process. Speech by adults to children help provide the child with correct language usage repetitively. Environmental influences on language development are explored in the tradition of social interactionist theory by such researchers as Jerome Bruner, Alison Gopnik, Andrew Meltzoff, Anat Ninio, Roy Pea, Catherine Snow, Ernest Moerk and Michael Tomasello. Jerome Bruner who laid the foundations of this approach in the 1970s, emphasized that adult \\"scaffolding\\" of the child's attempts to master linguistic communication is an important factor in the developmental process. One component of the young child's linguistic environment is child-directed speech (also known as baby talk or motherese), which is language spoken in a higher pitch than normal with simple words and sentences. Although the importance of its role in developing language has been debated, many linguists think that it may aid in capturing the infant's attention and maintaining communication. When children begin to communicate with adults, this motherese speech allows the child the ability to discern the patterns in language and to experiment with language. Throughout existing research, it is concluded that children exposed to extensive vocabulary and complex grammatical structures more quickly develop language and also have a more accurate syntax than children raised in environments without complex grammar exposed to them. With motherese, the mother talks to the child and responds back to the child, whether it be a babble the child made or a short sentence. While doing this, the adult prompts the child to continue communicating, which may help a child develop language sooner than children raised in environments where communication is not fostered. Child-directed speech concentrates on small core vocabulary, here and now topics, exaggerated facial expressions and gestures, frequent questioning, para-linguistic changes, and verbal rituals. An infant is least likely to produce vocalizations when changed, fed, or rocked. The infant is more likely to produce vocalizations in response to a nonverbal behavior such as touching or smiling. Child-directed speech also catches the child's attention, and in situations where words for new objects are being expressed to the child, this form of speech may help the child recognize the speech cues and the new information provided. Data shows that children raised in highly verbal families had higher language scores than those children raised in low verbal families. Continuously hearing complicated sentences throughout language development increases the child's ability to understand these sentences and then to use complicated sentences as they develop. Studies have shown that students enrolled in high language classrooms have two times the growth in complex sentences usage than students in classrooms where teachers do not frequently use complex sentences. Adults use strategies other than child-directed speech like recasting, expanding, and labeling: * Recasting is rephrasing something the child has said, perhaps turning it into a question or restating the child's immature utterance in the form of a fully grammatical sentence. For example, a child saying \\"cookie now\\" a parent may respond with \\"Would you like a cookie now?\\" * Expanding is restating, in a linguistically sophisticated form, what a child has said. For example, a child may say \\"car move road\\" and the parent may respond \\"A car drives on the road.\\" * Labeling is identifying the names of objects. If a child points to an object such as a couch the mother may say \\"couch\\" in response. Labeling can also be characterized as referencing. Some language development experts have characterized child directed speech in stages. Primarily, the parents use repetition and also variation to maintain the infant's attention. Secondly, the parent simplifies speech to help in language learning. Third, any speech modifications maintain the responsiveness of the child. These modifications develop into a conversation that provides context for the development. =Cultural and socioeconomic effects= While most children throughout the world develop language at similar rates and without difficulty, cultural and socioeconomic differences have been shown to influence development. An example of cultural differences in language development can be seen when comparing the interactions of mothers in the United States with their infants with mothers in Japan. Mothers in the United States use more questions, are more information-oriented, and use more grammatically correct utterances with their 3-month-olds. Mothers in Japan, on the other hand, use more physical contact with their infants, and more emotion-oriented, nonsense, and environmental sounds, as well as baby talk, with their infants. These differences in interaction techniques reflect differences in \\"each society's assumptions about infants and adult-to-adult cultural styles of talking.\\" Specifically in North American culture, maternal race, education, and socioeconomic class influence parent-child interactions in the early linguistic environment. When speaking to their infants, mothers from middle class \\"incorporate language goals more frequently in their play with their infants,\\" and in turn, their infants produce twice as many vocalizations as lower class infants. Mothers from higher social classes who are better educated also tend to be more verbal, and have more time to spend engaging with their infants in language. Additionally, lower class infants may receive more language input from their siblings and peers than from their mothers. Social preconditions It is crucial that children are allowed to socially interact with other people who can vocalize and respond to questions. For language acquisition to develop successfully, children must be in an environment that allows them to communicate socially in that language. Children who have learnt sound, meaning and grammatical system of language that can produce clear sentence may still not have the ability to use language effectively in various social circumstance. Social interaction is the footing stone of language. There are a few different theories as to why and how children develop language. One popular, yet heavily debated explanation is that language is acquired through imitation. This theory has been challenged by Lester Butler, who argues that children do not use the grammar that an adult would use. Furthermore, \\"children's language is highly resistant to alteration by adult intervention\\", meaning that children do not use the corrections given to them by an adult. R.L Trask also argues in his book Language: The Basics that deaf children acquire, develop and learn sign language in the same way hearing children do, so if a deaf child's parents are fluent sign speakers, and communicate with the baby through sign language, the baby will learn fluent sign language. And if a child's parents aren't fluent, the child will still learn to speak fluent sign language. Trask's theory therefore is that children learn language by acquiring and experimenting with grammatical patterns, the statistical language acquisition theory. The two most accepted theories in language development are psychological and functional. Psychological explanations focus on the mental processes involved in childhood language learning. Functional explanations look at the social processes involved in learning the first language. Different aspects *Phonology involves the rules about the structure and sequence of speech sounds. *Semantics consists of vocabulary and how concepts are expressed through words. *Grammar involves two parts. :* The first, syntax, is the rules in which words are arranged into sentences. :* The second, morphology, is the use of grammatical markers (indicating tense, active or passive voice etc.). *Pragmatics involves the rules for appropriate and effective communication. Pragmatics involves three skills: **using language for greeting, demanding etc., **changing language for talking differently depending on who it is you are talking to; **following rules such as turn taking, staying on topic. Each component has its own appropriate developmental periods. =Phonological development= Babies can recognize their mother's voice from as early as few weeks old. It seems like they have a unique system that is designed to recognize speech sound. Furthermore, they can differentiate between certain speech sounds. A significant first milestone in phonetic development is the babbling stage (around the age of six months). This is the baby's way of practicing his control over that apparatus. Babbling is independent from the language. Deaf children for instance, babble the same way as hearing ones. As the baby grows older, the babbling increases in frequency and starts to sound more like words (around the age of twelve months). Although every child is an individual with different pace of mastering speech, there is a tendency to an order of which speech sounds are mastered: *Vowels before consonants *Stop sounds before any other consonant sounds (for example: 'p','t','b') *Place of articulation ‚Äì labials, alveolar, velars, alveopalatals, and interdentals in that order by the age of 4. That means that there is some order to the development of the physical system in young children.  Early phonetic processes As the children's ability to produce sound develops, their ability to perceive the phonetic contrast of their language develops. The better they get in mastering the sound, the more sensitive they become to the changes in those sounds in their language once they get exposed to it. They learn to isolate individual phenomes while speaking which also serves as the basis of reading. Some processes that occur in early age: *Syllable deletion ‚Äì stressed syllables are emphasis that may be given to certain syllables in a word. They are more likely to be retained in children's pronunciation than unstressed syllables (less emphasis on the sound) because they are more salient to children in an early language acquisition process. So children may say helikat instead of helicopter or fowe instead of telephone. That way, they don't pronounce the more emphasized sound in the word. *Syllable simplification ‚Äì another process that happens in order to simplify syllable structure, children delete certain sounds systematically. For example, children might say 'tap' instead of \\"stop\\" and completely drop the 's' sound in that word. That is a common process in children's speech development. *Substitution ‚Äì systematic replacement of one sound by an alternative, easier one to articulate (substitution process ‚Äì stopping, fronting, gliding). It means that the young toddler may use sounds that are easier to produce instead of the proper sound in a word. We may see that the child replace the 'r' sound with 'l' or 'w', the 'n' with 'd' and so on. * Assimilation ‚Äì modification of segments of the word influenced by neighboring sounds, due to ease of articulation. In order for the young speaker to produce sounds easier, he or she may replace the sound in a specific word to a different one, which is somewhat similar. For example, the word \\"pig\\" may sound as \\"big\\" ‚Äì 'p' and 'b' are close in their sound. (Lightbown, Spada, Ranta & Rand, 2006). From shortly after birth to around one year, the baby starts to make speech sounds. At around two months, the baby engages in cooing, which mostly consists of vowel sounds. At around four to six months, cooing turns into babbling, which is the repetitive consonant-vowel combinations. Babies understand more than they are able to say. In this 0‚Äì8 months range, the child is engaged in vocal play of vegetative sounds, laughing, and cooing. Once the child hits the 8‚Äì12 month, range the child engages in canonical babbling, i.e. dada as well as variegated babbling. This jargon babbling with intonational contours the language being learned. From 12‚Äì24 months, babies can recognize the correct pronunciation of familiar words. Babies also use phonological strategies to simplify word pronunciation. Some strategies include repeating the first consonant-vowel in a multisyllable word ('TV' ‚Üí 'didi') or deleting unstressed syllables in a multisyllable word ('banana' ‚Üí 'nana'). Within this first year, two word utterances and two syllable words emerge. This period is often called the holophrastic stage of development, because one word conveys as much meaning as an entire phrase. For instance, the simple word \\"milk\\" can imply that the child is requesting milk, noting spilled milk, sees a cat drinking milk, etc. One study found that children at this age were capable of comprehending 2-word sentences, producing 2‚Äì3 word sentences, and naming basic colors. By 24‚Äì30 months awareness of rhyme emerges as well as rising intonation. One study concludes that children between the ages of 24‚Äì30 months typically can produce 3‚Äì4 word sentence, create a story when prompted by pictures, and at least 50% of their speech is intelligible. By 36‚Äì60 months, phonological awareness continues to improve as well as pronunciation. At this age, children have a considerable experience with language and are able to form simple sentences that are 3 words in length. They use basic prepositions, pronouns, and plurals. They become immensely creative in their language use and learn to categorize items such as recognizing that a shoe is not a fruit. At this age, children also learn to ask questions and negate sentences to develop these questions. Over time, their syntax gets more and more unique and complex. A study reveals that at this age, a child's speech should be at least 75% intelligible. By 6‚Äì10 years, children can master syllable stress patterns, which helps distinguish slight differences between similar words. =Semantic development= The average child masters about fifty words by the age of eighteen months. These might include words such as, milk, water, juice and apple (noun-like words). Afterwards they acquire 12 to 16 words a day. By the age of six, they master about 13 to 14 thousand words. The most frequent words include adjective-like expressions for displeasure and rejection such as 'no'. They also include social interaction words, such as \\"please\\" and \\"bye\\". There are three stages for learning the meaning of new words: # Whole object assumption: A new word refers to a whole object. For example, when an eighteen-months old child sees a sheep and his mother points at it and says the word 'sheep', the child infers that the word 'sheep' describes the whole animal and not parts of it (such as color, shape, etc.). # Type assumption: A new word refers to a type of thing, not just to a particular thing. For example, when the child hears the word 'sheep' he infers that it is used for the animal type and not only for that particular sheep that he saw. # Basic level assumption: A new word refers to objects that are alike in basic ways (appearance, behavior, etc.). In other words, when the child hears the word \\"sheep\\" he overgeneralizes it to other animals that look like sheep by the external appearance, such as white, wooly and four-legged animal. Contextual clues are a major factor in the child's vocabulary development. * The child uses contextual clues to draw inferences about the category and meaning of new words. By doing so, the child distinguishes between names and ordinary nouns. For example, when an object is presented to the child with the determiner \\"a\\" (a cat, a dog, a bottle) he perceives it as an ordinary noun. However, when the child hears a noun without the determiner, he perceives it as a name, for instance \\"this is Mary\\". Children usually make correct meaning associations with the words that the adults say. However, sometimes they make semantic errors. There are a few types of semantic errors: Overextension: When a child says or hears a word, they might associate what they see or hear as more generalized concept than the real meaning of the word. For example, if they say \\"cat\\", they might overextend it to other animals with same features. Underextension: It involves the use of lexical items in an overly restrictive fashion. In other words, the child focuses on core members of a certain category. For example: 'cat' may only refer to the family cat and no other cat, or 'dog' may refer to certain kinds of dogs that the child is exposed to. Verb meaning: when a pre-school child hears the verb 'fill', he understands it as the action 'pour' rather than the result, which is 'make full'. Dimensional terms: the first dimensional adjectives acquired are big and small because they belong to the size category. The size category is the most general one. Later children acquire the single dimension adjectives, such as, tall-short, long-short, high-low. Eventually they acquire the adjectives that describe the secondary dimension, such as thick-thin, wide-narrow and deep-shallow. From birth to one year, comprehension (the language we understand) develops before production (the language we use). There is about a 5-month lag in between the two. Babies have an innate preference to listen to their mother's voice. Babies can recognize familiar words and use preverbal gestures. Within the first 12‚Äì18 months semantic roles are expressed in one word speech including agent, object, location, possession, nonexistence and denial. Words are understood outside of routine games but the child still needs contextual support for lexical comprehension. 18‚Äì24 months Prevalent relations are expressed such as agent-action, agent-object, action-location. Also, there is a vocabulary spurt between 18‚Äì24 months, which includes fast mapping. Fast mapping is the babies' ability to learn a lot of new things quickly. The majority of the babies' new vocabulary consists of object words (nouns) and action words (verbs). 30‚Äì36 months The child is able to use and understand why question and basic spatial terms such as in, on or under. 36‚Äì42 months There is an understanding of basic color words and kinship terms. Also, the child has an understanding of the semantic relationship between adjacent and conjoined sentences, including casual and contrastive. 42‚Äì48 months When and how questions are comprehended as well as basic shape words such as circle, square and triangle. 48‚Äì60 months Knowledge of letter names and sounds emerges, as well as numbers. By 3‚Äì5 years, children usually have difficulty using words correctly. Children experience many problems such as underextensions, taking a general word and applying it specifically (for example, 'cartoons' specifically for 'Mickey Mouse') and overextensions, taking a specific word and applying it too generally (example, 'ant' for any insect). However, children coin words to fill in for words not yet learned (for example, someone is a cooker rather than a chef because a child may not know what a chef is). Children can also understand metaphors. From 6‚Äì10 years, children can understand meanings of words based on their definitions. They also are able to appreciate the multiple meanings of words and use words precisely through metaphors and puns. Fast mapping continues. Within these years, children are now able to acquire new information from written texts and can explain relationships between multiple meaning words. Common idioms are also understood. = Syntactic development = The development of syntactic structures follows a particular pattern and reveals much on the nature of language acquisition, which has several stages. According to O'Grady and Cho (2011), the first stage, occurring between the ages of 12‚Äì18 months, is called \\"one-word stage.\\" In this stage, children cannot form syntactic sentences and therefore use one-word utterances called \\"holophrases\\" that express an entire sentence. In addition, children's comprehension is more advanced than their production abilities. For example, a child who wants candy may say \\"candy\\" instead of expressing a full sentence. The following stage is the \\"two-word stage\\" in which children begin to produce \\"mini-sentences\\" that are composed of two words, such as \\"doggy bark\\" and \\"Ken water\\" (O'Grady & Cho, 2011, p. 346). At this stage, it is unclear whether children have an understanding of underlying rules of the language such as syntactic categories, since their \\"mini-sentences\\" often lack distinction between the categories. However, children do exhibit sensitivity to sentence structures and they frequently use appropriate word order. After several months of speech that is restricted to short utterances, children enter the \\"telegraphic stage\\" and begin to produce longer and more complex grammatical structures (O'Grady & Cho, 2011, p. 347). This stage is characterized by production of complex structures as children begin to form phrases consisting of a subject and a complement in addition to use of modifiers and composition of full sentences. Children use mostly content words and their sentences lack function words. For example, a child may say \\"fill cup water,\\" instead of saying, \\"Fill my cup with water.\\" Subsequently, language acquisition continues to develop rapidly and children begin to acquire complex grammar that shows understanding of intricate linguistic features, such as the ability to switch the position of words in sentences. Throughout the process of syntactic development, children acquire and develop question structures. According to O'Grady and Cho (2011), at the early stages of language acquisition, children ask yes-no questions by rising intonation alone as they develop awareness to auxiliary verbs only at a later stage. When auxiliary verbs make their appearance, it takes children a few months before they are able to use inversion in yes-no questions. The development of WH- questions occurs between the ages of two and four, when children acquire auxiliary verbs that then leads to the ability to use inversion in questions. However, some children find inversion easier in yes-no questions than in WH- questions, since the position of the WH- word and the auxiliary verb both must changed (e.g., \\"You are going where?\\" instead of \\"Where are you going?\\"). = Morphological development = Morphological structures development occurs over a period of several years. Before language is acquired, children lack any use of morphological structures. The morphological structures that children acquire during their childhood, and even up to the early school years, are: determiners (a, the), -ing inflection, plural ‚Äìs, auxiliary be, possessive ‚Äìs, third person singular ‚Äìs, past tense ‚Äìed). When children start using them they tend to overgeneralize the rules and project them upon all the words in the language, including irregulars. For example: if a child knows the ‚Äìed (past tense) there is a possibility that they'll say \\"I eated\\"( Man-mans cat-cats). These errors result from overgeneralization of rules. This overgeneralization is very noticeable, in fact, children do that in less than 25 percent of the time at any point before reducing that percentage. Then they improve their mastery, which can be tested in various ways, such as the \\"wug test\\" (Berko, 1958). Children often figure out quickly frequent irregular verbs, such as go and buy rather than less common ones, such as win. This suggests that children must hear the word several hundred times before they are able to use it correctly. This development of bound morphemes is similar in order among children, for example: -ing is acquired before the article the. The interesting part though is that parents tend to use a different order while speaking to their kids, for example, parents use the article 'the' more frequently than -ing. Meaning, other factors determine the order of acquisition, such as: # Morphemes that come at the end of an utterance are remembered better. # Children seem to remember morphemes such as ‚Äìing better because they contain their own syllables rather than single consonant morpheme, such as plural ‚Äìs. # Affixes with more than one meaning are more difficult to acquire, e.g., ‚Äìs functions both as plural noun and singular third. As it comes to word formation processes such as derivation and compounding, the earliest derivational suffixes to show up in children's speech are those they hear adults use most frequently. (-er as the *'doer' of the action such as walker.) When it comes to compounds, children first make up names for agents and instruments that they don't know by a pattern (N-N), though some of them do not follow the pattern (*cutter grass for grass cutter). Then, they might have the right structure but the words are inappropriate since English already has words with the intended meaning such as car-smoke = exhaust. This process points to a preference for building words from other words, thus place less demand on memory than learning an entirely new word for each concept. =Grammatical development= Grammar describes the way sentences of a language are constructed, which includes both syntax and morphology. Syntactic development and morphological development Syntactic development involves the ways that various morphemes are ordered or combined in sentences.Morphemes, which are basic units of meaning in language, get added as children learn to produce simple sentences and become more precise speakers. Morphemes can be whole words (like \\"happy\\") or parts of words that change meaning of words (\\" _un\\"_ happy). Brown proposed a stage model that describes the various types of morphological structures that are developed in English and the age range within which they are normally acquired. Stage I: From 15‚Äì30 months, children start using telegraphic speech, which are two word combinations, for example 'wet diaper'. Brown (1973)Brown, R. (1973). A first language: The early stages. Harvard University Press. observed that 75% of children's two-word utterances could be summarized in the existence of 11 semantic relations: *Attributive: 'Big house' *Agent-action: 'Daddy hit' *Action-object: 'Hit ball' *Agent-object: 'Daddy ball' *Nominative: 'That ball' *Demonstrative: 'There ball' *Recurrence: 'More ball' *Non-existence: 'All-gone ball' *Possessive: 'Daddy chair' *Entity + Locative: 'book table' *Action + Locative: 'go store' Stage II: At around 28‚Äì36 months, children begin to engage in the production of simple sentences, usually 3 word sentences. These simple sentences follow syntactic rules and are refined gradually as development continues. The morphological developments seen in this age range include use of present progressive ( _-ing_ endings), the prepositions \\"in\\" and \\"on\\", and regular plurals ( _-s_ endings). Stage III: Around 36‚Äì42 months, children continue to add morphemes and gradually produce complex grammatical structures. The morphemes that are added at this age include irregular past tense, possessive ('s), and use of the verb 'to be' (It _is_ , I _am_ , etc.). Stage IV:Around 40‚Äì46 months children continue to add to their morphological knowledge. This range is associated with use of articles ( _a_ or _the_ ), regular past tense ( _-ed_ endings), and regular third person speech ( _He likes_ it). Stage V: Around 42-52+ months children refine the complex grammatical structures and increase their use of morphemes to convey more complex ideas. Children in this stage use irregular third- person speech, the verb 'to be' as an auxiliary verb (She _was not_ laughing), and in its contraction forms (It _'s_ , She _'s_ , etc.). = Pragmatics development= From birth to one year, babies can engage in joint attention (sharing the attention of something with someone else). Infants also can engage in turn taking activities on the basis of their sensitivity to reactive contingency, which can elicit social responses in the babies from very early on. *By 1‚Äì2 years, they can engage in conversational turn taking and topic maintenance and understand that turn taking interaction of others can convey relevant, communicative information. *By age 3‚Äì5, children can master illocutionary intent, knowing what you meant to say even though you might not have said it and turnabout, which is turning the conversation over to another person. *By age 6‚Äì10, shading occurs, which is changing the conversation topic gradually. Children are able to communicate effectively in demanding settings, such as on the telephone. =Effect of bilingualism= There is a large debate regarding whether or not bilingualism is truly beneficial to children. Parents of children often view learning a second language throughout elementary and high school education beneficial to the child. Another perspective dictates that the second language just confuses the child and prevents them from mastering their primary language. Studies have shown that American bilingual children have greater cognitive flexibility, better perceptual skills and tend to be divergent thinkers than monolingual children between the ages of five to ten. Better executive functioning skills are likely because bilingual children have to choose one language to speak while actively suppressing the other. This builds stronger selective attention and cognitive flexibility because these skills are being exercised more. In addition, bilingual children have a better understanding of universal language concepts, such as grammar, because these concepts are applied in multiple languages. However, studies comparing Swedish-Finnish bilingual children and Swedish monolingual children between the ages of five to seven have also shown that the bilingual children have a smaller vocabulary than monolingual children. In another study throughout America, elementary school English-monolingual children performed better in mathematics and reading activities than their non-English-dominant bilingual and non-English monolingual peers from kindergarten to grade five. Learning two languages simultaneously can be beneficial or a hindrance to a child's language and intellectual development. Further research is necessary to continue to shed light on this debate. In addition to the study of bilingualism in children, similar research is being conducted in adults. Research findings show that although bilingual benefits are muted in middle adulthood, they are more profound in older age when those who develop dementia experience onset about 4.5 years later in bilingual subjects. The increased attentional control, inhibition, and conflict resolution developed from bilingualism may be accountable for the later onset of dementia.  Misdiagnoses as a language impairment  There is some research that demonstrates that bilingualism may often be misdiagnosed as a language impairment. A subtopic of bilingualism in the literature is nonstandard varieties of English. While bilingualism and nonstandard varieties of English cannot be considered a true language impairment, they are misrepresented in the population of those receiving language interventions.  Language disorders  A language disorder is the impaired comprehension and or use of a spoken, written, and/or other symbol system. A disorder may involve problems in the following areas: #The form of language i.e. phonology, morphology, or syntax #The content i.e. semantics #The function of language in communication i.e. pragmatics Olswang and colleagues have identified a series of behaviors in children in the 18‚Äì36 month range that are predictors for the need of language intervention. These predictors include: * A smaller than average vocabulary * A language comprehension delay of 6 months or a comprehension deficit with a large comprehension production gap * Phonological problems such as restricted babbling or limited vocalizations * Few spontaneous vocal imitations and reliance on direct modeling in imitation tasks * Little combinatorial or symbolic play * Few communicative or symbolic gestures * Behavior problems Some of the many conditions that cause language development problems include: *Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder *Auditory processing disorder *Autism *Developmental verbal dyspraxia *Language delay *Otitis media *Pragmatic language impairment *Specific language impairment *Speech delay *Speech disorder *Speech sound disorder *Speech repetition See also *Computational models of language acquisition *Errors in early word use *Essay on the Origin of Languages *Evolutionary linguistics *Genie (feral child) *Infantile speech *KE family *Language acquisition *Language acquisition device *List of children's speech corpora *Mean length of utterance *Metalinguistic awareness *Origin of language *Phonological development *Pragmatic mapping *Proto-Human language *Speech *Victor of Aveyron  Reference list *Lightbown, P.

The school district boundaries are coterminous with the city of Harrisburg. The Harrisburg City School District encompasses approximately . According to 2000 federal census data, it served a resident population of 48,950. By 2010, the district's population increased to 49,550 people.US Census Bureau, 2010 Census Poverty Data by Local Educational Agency, 2011 Harrisburg public schools provide education for the city's youth, beginning with preschool through twelfth grade. According to district officials, in school year 2007‚Äì08 the Harrisburg City School District provided basic educational services to 8,391 pupils through the employment of 723 teachers, 209 full-time and part-time support personnel and 60 administrators. Enrollment steadily declined since 2005 due to a steady exodus from the city and a lower reproductive rate. A multi-year restructuring and reform plan was aimed at making the district a model, urban educational system. In July 2000, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court issued a ruling that upholds the Education Empowerment Act adopted by the Pennsylvania General Assembly, and signed by then‚ÄìGovernor Tom Ridge, that permitted a change in the governance of the Harrisburg School District from an elected school board, to a board of control named by Harrisburg mayor Stephen R. Reed, and which gave the mayor direct oversight of the troubled district. It was the first time a mayor had taken on the role in the state.

Questions focused on parent awareness of services available to students. Academic achievement In 2015, Harrisburg School District ranked 491st out of 496 Pennsylvania public school districts, by the Pittsburgh Business Times. The ranking is based on the last 3 years of student academic achievement as demonstrated by PSSAs results in: reading, writing, math and science and the three Keystone Exams (literature, Algebra 1, Biology I) in high school. Three school districts were excluded because they do not operate high schools (Saint Clair Area School District, Midland Borough School District, Duquesne City School District). The PSSAs are given to all children in grades 3rd through 8th. Adapted PSSA examinations are given to children in the special education programs. Writing exams were given to children in 5th and 8th grades. *2014 - 492nd *2013 - 493rdPittsburgh Business Times, Guide to Pennsylvania Schools - Statewide ranking 2013, April 4, 2013 *2012 - 494thPittsburgh Business Times, Statewide Honor Roll Rankings 2012, April 4, 2012 *2011 - 494thPittsburgh Business Times, Statewide Honor Roll Rankings 2011, April 4, 2011 *2010 - 495thPittsburgh Business Times, Pennsylvania School District Rankings, May 1, 2010 *2009 - 496th *2008 - 497thPittsburgh Business Times, The Honor Roll - Statewide, May 15, 2008. *2007 - 498th of 501 school districts In 2012, the Pittsburgh Business Times also reported an Overachievers Ranking for 498 Pennsylvania school districts.

Included on the 2014‚Äì15 list are: Foose School, Rowland School, Scott School and Harrisburg High School. Parents and students may be eligible for scholarships to transfer to another public or nonpublic school through the state's Opportunity Scholarship Tax Credit Program passed in June 2012. The scholarships are limited to those students whose family's income is less than $60,000 annually, with another $12,000 allowed per dependent. Maximum scholarship award is $8,500, with special education students receiving up to $15,000 for a year's tuition. Parents pay any difference between the scholarship amount and the receiving school's tuition rate. Students may seek admission to neighboring public school districts. Each year the PDE publishes the tuition rate for each individual public school district. This was the third year that these Harrisburg School District schools were placed on the lowest achievement list.

The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 - 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive, Pennsylvania Department of Education ‚Äî Division of Food and Nutrition.

The district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the Department of Special Education. The Harrisburg City School District received a $5,128,246 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì12 and 2012-13 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 52, or 0.61% of its students, were gifted in 2009.

One report is that Wriston declined the offers because these were not made to him personally by the then-President. Wriston also would have had to take a substantial pay cut had he accepted the government position. He served as Chairman of The Business Council in 1981 and 1982.The Business Council, Official website, Background From 1982 to 1989, Wriston was chairman of President Ronald Reagan's Economic Policy Advisory Board.http://www.nndb.com/people/764/000167263/ Awards and honors In 1987, the Manhattan Institute of Policy Research initiated a lecture series in honor of Wriston.http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/wriston.htm In 2004 the Idea Channel organized a seven-part series of interviews with him.http://www.ideachannel.com/product_info.php?products_id=1146 Idea Channel In June 2004 Wriston was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civil honor, by President George W. Bush. Personal life In 1942, Walter Wriston married Barbara Brengle, with whom he had one daughter. Two years after her death in 1966, he married lawyer and businesswoman Kathryn Dineen. Wriston died on January 19, 2005 in Manhattan, New York City, New York, at the age of 85.

Egerton is widely considered to be one of the most important writers in the late nineteenth century New Woman movement, and a key exponent of early modernism in English-language literature. Born in Melbourne, Australia, she spent her childhood in Ireland, where she settled for a time, and considered herself to be \\"intensely Irish\\".Eleanor Fitzsimons, \\"The Irish Identity of George Egerton\\". Irish Women's Writing Network, 4 August 2017: \\"In a letter to her cousin Ethel de Vere White, written in 1926, Egerton declared herself ‚ÄòIntensely Irish‚Äô\\". Life George Egerton was born Mary Chavelita Dunne in Melbourne, Australia, in 1859, to a Welsh Protestant mother, Isabel George Bynon, and an Irish Catholic father, Captain John J. Dunne. The earliest years of her life were marked by migration between Australia, New Zealand and Chile, but most of her formative years were spent in and around Dublin, and Egerton was to refer to herself throughout her life as \\"intensely Irish\\".(Terence De Vere White, A Leaf from the Yellow Book, London: The Richards Press, 1958, p. 14 Raised Catholic, she was schooled for two years in Germany as a teenager. There, she demonstrated a talent for art and linguistics, but her ambitions to become an artist had to be shelved after the death of her mother when she was fourteen, at which time she became the caretaker for her younger siblings. She subsequently trained as a nurse.RIA/Cambridge Dictionary of Irish Biography (2009), Vol. III, p. 596. As a young adult, Egerton spent two years in New York in an abortive attempt to earn money to support her father, brothers and sisters. Failing at this endeavour (though some of her experiences in the USA would serve as inspiration for her 1898 novel The Wheel of God), she returned to live in England. In 1888, in events which were notorious enough to be widely published in leading newspapers in the UK and Ireland, Egerton eloped with the then-married Henry Peter Whyte-Melville (born Henry Peter Higginson). In retaliation, Whyte-Melville's wife accused her estranged husband of being a bigamist, claiming he was already married at the time that she wed him. This allegation was later proved to be untrue. During the period of the elopement, Egerton's father pursued the couple and, newspaper reports confirm, shot at Whyte-Melville in a hansom cab. Whyte-Melville was divorced later that year and he and Egerton married in Detroit in the summer of 1888.See ‚ÄòIreland‚Äô, The Times (London) (24 January 1888), p. 10. ‚ÄòIreland‚Äô, The Times (London) (28 August 1888), p. 6, and Divorce Certificate dated 6 March 1886 declaring Whyte-Melville‚Äôs first marriage legally dissolved, Dunne/Egerton Papers, National Library of Ireland, Dublin, P9022/MS10946. The marriage lasted until his death a year later. With Whyte-Melville, Egerton moved to Norway, where she lived for two years. This time spent in Norway was formative to her in terms of her intellectual growth and artistic development. While in Norway she immersed herself in the work of Henrik Ibsen, August Strindberg, Ola Hansson, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Knut Hamsun. Her brief romantic connection to Hamsun served as the inspiration for her 1893 short story \\"Now Spring Has Come\\". Hamsun went on to win the Nobel prize for literature, and Egerton was the first to make Hamsun's work accessible to an English readership, with her translation of his first novel Hunger (Sult), published in 1899. A second marriage (in 1891) to the minor adventurer and author Egerton Tertius Clairmonte was the impetus for her first attempts at writing fiction ‚Äì instigated by his penniless status and her desire to alleviate the boredom she felt upon her return to rural Ireland. She chose the pseudonym \\"George Egerton\\" as a tribute to both her mother and to Clairmonte. Asked how to say her pen name, she told The Literary Digest it was pronounced edg'er-ton, adding \\"This name is pronounced this way, as far as I know by all bearers of the name in England.\\"Charles Earle Funk, What's the Name, Please?, Funk & Wagnalls, 1936. Literary career Egerton's first book of short stories, Keynotes, was published by John Lane and Elkin Mathews of the Bodley Head in 1893 and illustrated by Aubrey Beardsley. Like other Bodley Head and Beardsley-illustrated publications, it is associated with both the literary fin de si√®cle and \\"Decadent\\" movements. Keynotes was phenomenally successful (and notorious) on both sides of the Atlantic and as a result of this Egerton became a celebrity, was interviewed in the leading magazines of the day, and was famously lampooned in Punch.‚ÄòShe-Notes by Borgia Smudgiton‚Äô, Punch (10 March 1894), p. 109 and ‚ÄòShe-Notes by Borgia Smudgiton‚Äô, Punch (17 March 1894), p. 130. Keynotes and her subsequent fiction often had the same thematic preoccupation: a dismissal of female purity as a male construct that denies women the right to expect and experience sexual freedom and fulfilment. Commentators long felt that Keynotes was the high-water mark of Egerton's literary career, but a renewed interest in her later work gained momentum in the first decade of the twenty-first century and has continued apace. As a result, recent academic scholarship has increasingly focused on her subsequent volume of short stories, Discords, and her later efforts ‚Äì including two additional short story volumes (Symphonies and Flies in Amber); two novels (Rosa Amorosa and The Wheel of God); and a book of Nietzschean parables (Fantasias). Her later incarnation as a playwright (Camilla States Her Case, 1925) and translator of plays (most notably from the French) generated only a few moderately successful productions. She was a friend of George Bernard Shaw, Ellen Terry and J. M. Barrie. =Politics= Egerton's work is among the most forthrightly outspoken in nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century English-language literature in terms of a demand for women's education, financial independence, and sexual freedom. Yet, while she was firmly associated with the New Woman movement, Egerton claimed to be \\"embarrassed\\" by this reduction of her work. Interestingly, like Emily Lawless, Egerton was one of the major feminist writers of the period who chose to distance herself from the female suffrage movement, although in her private letters she could be forthrightly pro-suffrage. For instance, she wrote in a letter to her father in 1908: 'H. Gladstone that mediocre son of an overrated father is a feeble thing at the head of any department. The women won‚Äôt be beaten in the long run. -- In every class they have a greater average of intelligence than the men...It isn't a question of Rights. It is a question of Economic change. A Surplus population of women who must work, outside home life...means: if I pay the tax -- I must get the vote!' Letter from Egerton to John J. Dunne (29 February 1908), Department of Rare Books and Special Collections, Princeton University, Selected Papers of Mary Chavelita Bright, Box 2 Folder 17 Some critics see an anti-authoritarian impulse in her work. Her feminism can be read as a feminism of difference, or as an individualist feminism. Egerton's short stories are typically critical of organised religion, and include many discussions of atheism. She was scathing of marriage as an institution, and many of her protagonists overtly defy Victorian and Christian morality by advocating free unions, same sex parenting partnerships and single parenthood. =Reputation= Egerton's stylistic innovations and her often radical and feminist subject matterJusova, I. \\"The New Woman and the Empire: Gender, Racial, and Colonial Issues\\" in Sarah Grand, George Egerton, Elizabeth Robins, and Amy Levy. The Ohio State University Press, 2005. have ensured that her fiction continues to generate academic interest in America and Britain. Thomas Hardy acknowledged the influence of Egerton's work on his own, in particular on the construction of his \\"New Woman\\" character, Sue Bridehead, in Jude the Obscure, and Tina O'Toole has described New Woman writers in general, and Egerton in particular, as the \\"missing link\\" to the sexually transgressive work of later writers such as Kate O'Brien (novelist). Holbrook Jackson credited Egerton with the first mention of Friedrich Nietzsche in English literature (she refers to Nietzsche in Keynotes in 1893, three years before the first of Nietzsche's works was translated into English).Jackson suggests that ‚Äò[t]he earliest reference to Nietzsche in the literature of the period is to be found in George Egerton‚Äôs Keynotes‚Äô, Holbrook Jackson, The Eighteen Nineties, London: Grant Richards, 1922, p. 129) Her experimentation with form and content has also been described as anticipating the modernism of writers like Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Jean Rhys, and D. H. Lawrence, and her 1898 novel The Wheel of God, in particular, has been posited as a rudimentary template for James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and as a potential influence on segments of Ulysses.

Lewis, Charles Short, A Latin Dictionary, Oxford. Clarendon Press. 1879. ) is the largest lowland region of Mars. It is in the northerly latitudes of the planet and encircles the northern polar region. Vastitas Borealis is often simply referred to as the northern plains, northern lowlands or the North polar erg\\"known as the North polar erg\\" at HiRISE project of Mars. The plains lie 4‚Äì5 km below the mean radius of the planet, and is centered at . To the north lies Planum Boreum. A small part of Vastitas Borealis lies in the Ismenius Lacus quadrangle. The region was named by Eugene Antoniadi, who noted the distinct albedo feature of the Northern plains in his book La Plan√®te Mars (1930). The name was officially adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1973.USGS Planetary Nomenclature (click on the feature name for details) Although it is not an officially recognized feature, the North Polar Basin makes up most of the lowlands in the Northern Hemisphere of Mars. As a result, Vastitas Borealis lies within the North Polar Basin, while Utopia Planitia, another very large basin, is adjacent to it. Some scientists have speculated the plains were covered by a hypothetical ocean at some point in Mars' history and putative shorelines have been suggested for its southern edges. Today these mildly sloping plains are marked by ridges, low hills, and sparse cratering. Vastitas Borealis is noticeably smoother than similar topographical areas in the south. In 2005 the European Space Agency's Mars Express spacecraft imaged a substantial quantity of water ice in a crater in the Vastitas Borealis region. The environmental conditions at the locality of this feature are suitable for water ice to remain stable. It was revealed after overlaying frozen carbon dioxide sublimated away at the commencement of the Northern Hemisphere Summer and is believed to be stable throughout the Martian year. A NASA probe named Phoenix landed safely in a region of Vastitas Borealis unofficially named Green Valley on 25 May 2008 (in the early Martian summer). Phoenix landed at 68.218830¬∞N 234.250778¬∞E. The probe, which will remain stationary, collected and analyzed soil samples in an effort to detect water and determine how hospitable the planet might once have been for life to grow. It remained active there until winter conditions became too harsh around five months later. Surface Surface of Mars, as seen by Phoenix. The ground is shaped into polygons which are common where the ground freezes and thaws. Unlike some the sites visited by the Viking and Pathfinder landers, nearly all the rocks near the Phoenix landing site on Vastitas Borealis are small. For about as far as the camera can see, the land is flat, but shaped into polygons. The polygons are between 2‚Äì3 m in diameter and are bounded by troughs that are 20 to 50 cm deep. These shapes are caused by ice in the soil reacting to major temperature changes.Levy, J, J. Head, and D. Marchant. 2009. Thermal contraction crack polygons on Mars: Classification, distribution, and climate implications from HiRISE observations. Journal of Geographical Research: 114. p E01007 The top of the soil has a crust. The microscope showed that the soil is composed of flat particles (probably a type of clay) and rounded particles. When the soil is scooped up, it clumps together. Although other landers in other places on Mars have seen many ripples and dunes, no ripples or dunes are visible in the area of Phoenix. Ice is present a few inches below the surface in the middle of the polygons. Along the edge of the polygons the ice is at least 8 inches deep. When the ice is exposed to the Martian atmosphere it slowly disappears. In the winter there would be accumulations of snow on the surface.Whiteway, J. et al. 2009. Mars Water-Ice Clouds and Precipitation. Science: 325. p 68-70 =Surface chemistry= Results published in the journal Science after the Phoenix mission ended reported that chloride, bicarbonate, magnesium, sodium, potassium, calcium, and possibly sulfate were detected in the samples. The pH was narrowed down to 7.7 + or - 0.5. Perchlorate (ClO4), a strong oxidizer, was detected. This was a significant discovery. The chemical has the potential of being used for rocket fuel and as a source of oxygen for future colonists. Under certain conditions perchlorate can inhibit life; however some microorganisms obtain energy from the substance (by anaerobic reduction). The chemical when mixed with water can greatly lower freezing points, in a manner similar to how salt is applied to roads to melt ice. Perchlorate strongly attracts water; consequently it could pull humidity from the air and produce a small amount of liquid water on Mars today. Gullies, which are common in certain areas of Mars, may have formed from perchlorate melting ice and causing water to erode soil on steep slopes.Hecht, M. et al. 2009. Detection of Perchlorate and the Soluble Chemistry of Martian Soil at the Phoenix Lander Site. Science: 325. 64-67 Two sets of experiments demonstrated that the soil contains 3-5% calcium carbonate. When a sample was slowly heated in the Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer (TEGA), a peak occurred at 725 ¬∞C, which is what would happen if calcium carbonate were present. In a second experiment acid was added to a soil sample in the Wet Chemistry Laboratory (WCL) while a pH electrode measured the pH. Since the pH rose from 3.3 to 7.7, it was concluded that calcium carbonate was present. Calcium carbonate changes the texture of soil by cementing particles. Having calcium carbonate in the soil may be easier on life forms because it buffers acids, creating a pH more friendly toward life.Boynton, W. et al. 2009. Evidence for Calcium Carbonate at the Mars Phoenix Landing Site. Science: 325. p 61-64 = Patterned ground = Much of the surface of Vastitas Borealis is covered with patterned ground. Sometimes the ground has the shape of polygons. Close-up views of patterned ground in the shape of polygons was provided by the Phoenix lander. In other places, the surface has low mounds arranged in chains. Some scientists first called the features fingerprint terrain because the many lines looked like someone's fingerprint.Guest, J., P. Butterworth, and R. Greeley. 1977. Geological observations in the Cydonia region of Mars from Viking. J. Geophys. Res. 82. 4111-4120. Similar features in both shape and size are found in terrestrial periglacial regions such as Antarctica. Antarctica's polygons are formed by repeated expansion and contraction of the soil-ice mixture due to seasonal temperature changes. When dry soil falls into cracks sand wedges are made which increase this effect. This process results in polygonal networks of stress fractures.Signs of Aeolian and Periglacial Activity at Vastitas Borealis (HiRISE Image ID: PSP_001481_2410) Image:Dunes in Olympia Planum.jpgOlympia Planitia Dunes, as seen by HiRISE.

Defrosting In the spring, various shapes appear because frost is disappearing from the surface, exposing the underling dark soil.

Glaciers Glaciers formed much of the observable surface in large areas of Mars. Much of the area in high latitudes is believed to still contain enormous amounts of water ice. In March 2010, scientists released the results of a radar study of an area called Deuteronilus Mensae that found widespread evidence of ice lying beneath a few meters of rock debris. The ice was probably deposited as snowfall during an earlier climate when the poles were tilted more.Madeleine, J. et al. 2007.

Wind speeds ranged from 11 to 58 km per hour. The usual average speed was 36 km per hour. The highest temperature measured during the mission was -19.6 ¬∞C, while the coldest was -97.7 ¬∞C. Dust devils were observed.Smith, P. et al. H2O at the Phoenix Landing Site. 2009. Science:325. p58-61 Cirrus clouds that produced snow were sighted in Phoenix imagery. The clouds formed at a level in the atmosphere that was around -65 ¬∞C, so the clouds would have to be composed of water-ice, rather than carbon dioxide-ice because the temperature for forming carbon dioxide ice is much lower‚Äîless than -120 ¬∞C. As a result of the mission, it is now believed that water ice (snow) would have accumulated later in the year at this location. Scientists think that water ice was transported downward by snow at night. It sublimated (went directly from ice to vapor) in the morning. Throughout the day convection and turbulence mixed it back into the atmosphere. = Climate cycles = Interpretation of the data transmitted from the Phoenix craft was published in the journal Science. As per the peer reviewed data the presence of water ice has been confirmed and that the site had a wetter and warmer climate in the recent past. Finding calcium carbonate in the Martian soil leads scientists to believe that the site had been wet or damp in the geological past. During seasonal or longer period diurnal cycles water may have been present as thin films. The tilt or obliquity of Mars changes far more than the Earth; hence times of higher humidity are probable.Boynton, et al. 2009. Evidence for Calcium Carbonate at the Mars Phoenix Landing Site.

The battle is named after the Iraqi town of Al Busayyah, which sat at a critical crossroads and was an Iraqi Army stronghold. The town consisted of forty to fifty buildings, most located along one main north‚Äìsouth road. It was defended by a battalion-sized Iraqi infantry unit reinforced by T-55 tanks, armored personnel carriers, and elements of an Iraqi commando battalion.Bourque P.257 The town was heavily fortified with machine gun nests and fighting positions. Twelve Iraqi tanks and twelve other armored vehicles were dug-in deeply at strategic positions in, and around, the town. Trenchlines stretched fifteen hundred meters south of town, radiating out to perimeter strong points. Background Charged with taking the town of Al Busayyah was the 2nd Brigade, known as the \\"Iron Brigade,\\" of the 1st Armored Division (1AD), part of VII Corps, commanded by General Frederick M. Franks, Jr. The 2nd Brigade's 2-70 Armor, now TF 2-70 or Task Force 2-70, was to move north in formation and seize the town of Al Busayyah with TF 4-70 Armor on its right flank, and then with the rest of the brigade proceed to attack \\"Position Python\\", where it would strike Saddam Hussein's elite Republican Guard north of Kuwait. Battle On the evening of the 25 February 1991 and into the early morning of the 26 February 1991, 2-1 FA pounded Iraqi targets with DPICM and HE rounds. At dawn, 06:30am, on the 26 February 1991, the task force moved towards Phase Line Smash on the outskirts of Al Busayyah. Phase lines are map references occurring every few kilometres used to measure progress of an offensive operation. 54th Combat Eng. Bn cleared two mine fields leading to the approach to the town. At 7:40 a.m., the task force reached Phase Line Smash. In crossing the four kilometers to Al Busayyah, American mortar fire dropped smoke rounds on top of the forward Iraqi positions. Many Iraqi soldiers surrendered almost immediately as Task Force (TF) 2-70 forces approached Al Busayyah. The TF 2-70 scout platoon laid suppressive fire on the town and Iraqis returned small arms fire from within the town but it was ineffective. The scout platoon remained to process many of the surrendering Iraqis bypassed by the task force. Alpha Company, 4-70 Armor, commanded by Captain Phil Thieler moved, on the left flank, encountered two T-55 tanks and many other tracked vehicles, and a platoon of dismounted Iraqi soldiers. Rounds were fired from the Iraqi trenches, but as the tanks approached, the Iraqi soldiers surrendered. Bravo Company, 6/6 Infantry sighted tanks and trucks inside the town as well as a T-62 on the outside to the north. B Company swept through, using reconnaissance by fire. In return it received some ineffectual small arms return fire and observed an Iraqi mortar round land about 150 meters from the front line of their vehicles. M1 Abrams move out during the Gulf War. The rest of Task Force 4-70 Armor (the \\"Black Lions\\", commanded by Lieutenant Colonel William C. Feyk), advanced on the right flank. As they moved into their attack by fire position, TF 4-70 reported two BRDMs and several surrendering Iraqi soldiers. They did not engage the vehicles because the location of Task Force 6/6 Infantry to their right was not confirmed. Continuing their advance, they encountered and destroyed an abandoned T-55 at close range. Delayed by what appeared to be a minefield, the Bradleys struggled to catch up with the task force as they bypassed the obstacle to the left. Clearing the town to the north, Black Lions linked up with the rest of the force and reestablished contact with Fox on the right. Charlie and Delta Companies, commanded by Captain James Goldberg and Captain Patrick Vess, moved forward, side by side. Both company commanders were told to look for five T55's. They found the tanks at only 300 metres, as the T-55's were rising from their hide positions to engage Goldberg's and Vess' tanks. C and D companies opened fire. All of the T-55's were destroyed. As the task force swept through the objective, brigade ordered the battalion to expeditiously move north in order to clear a kill box for an incoming MLRS artillery strike on the town. Persistent resistance against 6-6 from within the town had prompted the artillery barrage. The main body was able to move quickly, but trail elements handling prisoners of war delayed the fire mission. At 08:50am the box was clear, and the artillery mission was executed. At this point the Iron Brigade continued to push northeast. During the battle of Al Busayyah, 2-70 Armor captured 16 enemy soldiers and destroyed numerous vehicles to include 7 tanks, 2 BRDMs, 1 BMP, and 25 wheeled vehicles. 4-70 Armor destroyed five tanks and numerous other Iraqi Army vehicles. After Al Busayyah, the brigade continued movement northeast, expecting to halt along Phase Line New Mexico. At approximately 1230 and east of Python, the task force halted to conduct refueling and resupply. Iron Brigade would go on to fight at the Battle of Medina Ridge the following day.

The Mississippi Suite (Tone Journey) is a 1926 orchestral suite in four movements by Ferde Grof√©, depicting scenes along a journey down the Mississippi River from its headwaters of Minnesota down to New Orleans. History The work was composed by Grof√© in 1926 and first performed in the summer of that year by Paul Whiteman's orchestra at the Hippodrome Theatre, New York City. Later, American lyricist Harold Adamson wrote words to music from the ballad theme of the suite's final movement. The resulting song was called \\"Daybreak\\". Frank Sinatra recorded \\"Daybreak\\" twice, once with Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra on July 1, 1942, and nineteen years later, on May 2, 1961, for the album called \\"I Remember Tommy\\". (See under Adamson at #) Mississippi Suite incorporates elements from the Gershwins (which Grofe had arranged for) as well as Copland, making this a good example of 'American' classical music. Movements * I. Father of the Waters ‚Äì depicts the birth of the Mississippi River in the streams of Minnesota and the lands of the Chippewa Indians . * II. Huckleberry Finn ‚Äì based on the novel The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain. A short piece ruminating on Huck's prankish nature. * III. Old Creole Days ‚Äì Grofe's interpretation of spirituals sung by slaves on the plantations * IV. Mardi Gras ‚Äì depicts Fat Tuesday in New Orleans. The entire piece runs about 17 minutes. Recordings Paul Whiteman recorded the work in 1927 in abbreviated form (without first movement) because of the space limitations of the 12-inch 78-rpm disk, the lengthiest recording format available at that time. It was released on Victor Records by Paul Whiteman and His Concert Orchestra in 1927. Whiteman's recording was released by Victor on Victor 35859. Grof√©'s Mississippi Suite and Grand Canyon Suite, performed by the Eastman-Rochester Orchestra (i.e. the Orchestra of the Eastman School of Music), conducted by Howard Hanson, were recorded for Mercury Records in May 1958, re-issued on CD in 1995, coupled with the Cello Concerto No. 2 in E minor op. 30 by Victor Herbert, with Georges Miquelle, Cello. (Mercury Living Presence CD 434 355-2). This was the first stereo recording of it. The first full recording of the work, as Grof√© composed and orchestrated it for Paul Whiteman, was made in 2004 by Steven Richman conducting the Harmonie Ensemble/New York and released in 2006 (Bridge Records 9212).

The first edition of the Dimma, as it is commonly known, appeared (after a test issue on December 8, 1877) on January 5, 1878. it had a print run of 8,500 copies (in 1991 it was 13,300) and appeared five days weekly then, as of 2014 it appears once weekly, every Friday. As an answer to competing papers, the Wednesday edition is delivered free of charge to all households. Since April 5, 2005 one issue a week has been distributed to all households in the country free of charge. Since the founding of the Unionist Party in 1906, Dimma was the party paper, but it has since declared itself independent in 1995. The name Dimmal√¶tting combines the word dimmi 'darkness' and l√¶tting, from the verb l√¶tta 'leave'. Dimmi√∞ l√¶ttir means 'it is becoming daytime', or literally, 'the darkness is dwindling'. The paper's name comes from Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb, the very creator of the modern orthography of Faroese. The Danish name for the paper was the Amtstidene for F√¶r√∏erne (Official paper for the Faroese), and the Faroese name was printed in small letters. In its early years, the paper was only published in the Danish language. Then, from 1910 to 1947, it was printed in both languages, and in the years since 1947, Faroese has dominated. Today the entire paper is written in Faroese language. Until 1911, when a Wednesday edition began, the paper only appeared on Saturdays. In the 1920s, the paper expanded to six pages from the previous four. After 1970, the page count rose to eight or more. A third edition was added, and from September 1996, it has appeared five times a week from Tuesday to Saturday. In November 2004, the days were changed to Monday to Friday. Since the middle of March 2005, it has appeared in tabloid format. It was disbanded in 2013.

A female moroi is called a moroaicƒÉ (pl. moroaice). In some versions, a moroi is a phantom of a dead person which leaves the grave to draw energy from the living. Moroi are often associated with other figures in Romanian folklore, such as strigoi (another type of vampire), v√¢rcolac (werewolf), or pricolici (werewolf). As with most concepts in folklore, the exact characteristics ascribed to moroi are variable from source to source. Wlislocki reported a belief that the child of a woman impregnated by a nosferat (a sort of incubus-vampire) would be extremely ugly and covered with thick hair, very quickly becoming a moroi. They are also sometimes referred to in modern stories as the living offspring of two strigoi. It may also signify an infant who died before being baptized. The origins of the term \\"moroi\\" are unclear, but it is thought by the Romanian AcademyNoul dic≈£ionar explicativ al limbii Rom√¢ne, Bucharest: Litera Interna≈£ional, 2002. *moroi in Dic≈£ionarul explicativ al limbii Rom√¢ne, Academia Rom√¢n«é, 1998 to have possibly originated from the Old Slavonic word mora (\\"nightmare\\") ‚Äì cf. Russian kikimora. Moroi can also be forms of demons which possess a living body, usually the body of a bear. Moroi can be put under the control of a strigoi. Fantasy fiction The concept of \\"moroi\\" and \\"strigoi\\" have been fictionalized in popular culture, somewhat less often than traditional vampires. * Vampire Academy by Richelle Mead. In the Academy series the Moroi are known as mortal vampires with a normal lifespan and death. They tend to have magical powers, avoid too much sunlight, and drink the blood of humans and human hybrids. * In the novel A Matter of Taste in the book series The Dracula Sequence by Fred Saberhagen, the gypsy vampire Constantia uses Moroi as a generic word for vampire and refers to Dracula as a Moroi. This series does not differentiate between Strigoi and Moroi. * The Vampire: The Requiem role playing game's Ordo Dracul covenant supplement sourcebook features them as a vampire bloodline that is the amalgam of the basic Gangrel and Nosferatu vampire clans. *The supernatural inhabitant of the keep in the 1981 F. Paul Wilson novel The Keep implies that he is a moroi. * In the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game supplement Blood of the Night, the term Moroi applies to the baseline Vampire template found in the Bestiary in order to distinguish it from the older and more primal Nosferatu Vampire introduced in Blood of the Night. * Both Moroi and Strigoi appear in the manga Holy Knight, with the difference that Moroi in the manga are not immortal like the Strigoi. *The terms \\"moroi\\" and \\"strigoi\\" are also used in the Archie Horror comic book series Vampironica, with some redefinitions. Moroi is the term for undead vampires, who rise from the grave after being drained of their blood by another vampire; Strigoi are defined as \\"living\\" vampires, humans who are infected with vampirism while still alive.Vampironica #2, May 2018. * The term \\"moroi\\" is also used in the YouTube Series Impulse to describe those with the powers of teleportation, although this only applies to two characters, which originate from Romania.Impulse Season 2 Episode 4, October 2019.

It is situated in the historical region of Bukovina. Solca is the smallest town in the county and the third smallest town in Romania, with a population of 2,143 inhabitants, according to the 2011 census. Its name is derived from that of the river flowing through it, in turn derived from Slavic sol (\\"salt\\") ‚Äì in reference to the area's salty springs. Solca is known for its high quality air, for being a former spa and for the beer that was manufactured here. Geography Solca is located in the central-eastern part of Suceava County, at the foot of the eastern part of Obcina Mare Mountains, in Solca-Cacica Depression. The town is situated at the border of Suceava Plateau and the Eastern Carpathians, at an average altitude of 522 metres. Solca River crosses the town. Solca is a place known for the beauty of the natural landscape and the high quality of its air. Solca borders with the following communes: Marginea (in north-west), Arbore (in north and north-east), Poieni-Solca (in south and south-east), Cacica (in south) and MƒÉnƒÉstirea Humorului (in west). The town is situated at a distance of 23 km from the city of RƒÉdƒÉu»õi, 32 km from the town of Gura Humorului, 48 km from the city of Suceava (the county seat) and 464 km from Bucharest. The town is celebrated for its monumental Romanian Orthodox church, the former Sts. Peter and Paul's Monastery (1613‚Äì1623), also knowns as Solca Monastery, built by Voievod (Ruling Prince) »òtefan Tom»ôa II of Moldavia and closed by the Habsburgs in 1785, and a beer factory that ranks among the oldest in the country (1810). Salt springs are located in the northern forested area. Solca is also relatively close to the Cacica salt mine and the Arbore church. In Solca there is a Romanian traditional house which dates from the 17th century. This house was transformed in museum in 1971. Other points of interest are the motel (known as Hanul Solca), the sanatorium with the summer garden, the central park, Tom≈üa VodƒÉ High School, the Roman Catholic Church (which dates from 1868) and Pietrele Muierilor (a monument of nature located near the town). Despite the fact it has the status of a town, Solca has a rural aspect in many areas of its. During the Communist regime, there were built around 10 apartment blocks along the two main roads that cross the town: Tom»ôa VodƒÉ Street and Republicii Street. Solca isn't connected to the Romanian national railway system. The town administered the village of Poieni-Solca. Following a local referendum held in August 2004, Poieni-Solca was split from the town of Solca in March 2007 and became a commune. History View of the town, from the northern hill The settlement of Solca was first mentioned in a document issued by Moldavian Prince Alexandru cel Bun on January 15, 1418. On March 7, 1502, the boyar Luca Arbore bought the village from the grandchildren of C√¢rstea Horae»õ and ≈ûandru Gherman. Subsequently, Metropolitan Gheorghe MovilƒÉ offers this village to the Sucevi»õa Monastery. At the beginning of the 17th century, the village is bought by the Moldavian Prince ≈ûtefan Tom≈üa II (1611‚Äì1615, 1621‚Äì1623) and he builds here a monastery (known as Sts. Peter and Paul's Monastery or Solca Monastery). In the following centuries, Solca becomes a market town for the surrounding area. In 1775, together with the rest of Bukovina, Solca becomes part of the Habsburg Monarchy, and is eventually part of Austria-Hungary. During this period, many German, Polish and Jewish families establish here. Solca becomes a well known summer resort, its renowned fresh air helping the settlement to develop during the following century. In 1810, one of the oldest beer factories in Romania opens in Solca. The Solca Beer becomes the main symbol of this locality. At the initiative of doctors Eduard Beilich (1845) and Hermann Poras (1876) a sanatorium for lung diseases is opened, with an additional summer garden, so the tourism industry increases and the settlement becomes a well known spa of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. During World War I, Solca is the scene of Eastern Front battles between the armies of Austria-Hungary and the Russian Empire. After 1918, Solca (along with the rest of Bukovina) becomes part of Kingdom of Romania and remains a seeking resort, especially for those with lung diseases. Solca was officially declared a town in 1926. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Solca has a period of regression. The sanatorium is turned in a chronic diseases hospital and eventually, in 2011, in an asylum for the aged. The beer factory and the summer garden are abolished, the high school decreases in prestige and quality of teaching. Today, Solca isn't a resort anymore and the main occupation of its inhabitants is agriculture. Demographics According to the 2011 census data, 2,188 inhabitants live in Solca, a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2002 census, when the town had a population of 4,456 inhabitants. The main cause of the drastic population decline is that Poieni- Solca, the village administered by Solca, was split from the town in March 2007 and became a commune. Solca is the smallest town in Suceava County and the third smallest town in Romania. Only BƒÉile Tu»ônad and Nucet are smaller than Solca. Natives * Ilie E.

The player has been trapped inside and needs to collect three pieces of the \\"Golden Key of ACG\\" in order to escape. They can choose from three different characters; a Wizard, Knight or Serf. Each character has a different weapon to kill common enemies and access to a secret passage unique to them, meaning that navigating the castle is different for each one. There are a number of items scattered around the castle, of which the player may carry up to three at a time. Some of these are always in the same place at the start of the game, whereas others are distributed randomly. Items include differently- coloured keys which will unlock their respective doors, the three pieces of the ACG key, and other items that affect certain enemies or are mere red herrings. Common enemies appear in each room upon entering and will attack the player on sight. Collision with these enemies destroys them but drains a portion of the player's health. There are also stationary poisonous fungi which will drain health constantly if the player is in contact with them, and enemies that require special items in order to either distract, repel or kill them, otherwise they remain in the room, invulnerable to conventional attacks, and rapidly drain the player's health if touched. The player has three lives upon starting the game, and should they die a gravestone will appear at their location and stay in place for the remainder of the current game. Health can be replenished by collecting food scattered throughout the castle, however it will constantly drop the more the player moves, thus the player may eventually lose a life from starvation if they have not escaped the castle in time. Development Ultimate Play the Game was founded by brothers Tim and Chris Stamper, along with Tim's wife, Carol, from their headquarters in Ashby-de-la- Zouch in 1982. Under the trading name of Ultimate Play the Game, they began producing multiple video games for the ZX Spectrum throughout the early 1980s. Prior to founding Ultimate, the Stamper brothers had backgrounds in designing arcade machines, but no marketing experience in the video game sector. The operations of Ultimate were secretive and the Stamper brothers rarely gave interviews. Computer and Video Games noted that during development of Atic Atac, staff would work in \\"separate teams\\" to ensure quality control; one team would work on graphics whilst the other would oversee gameplay or sound. The Stamper brothers worked seven days a week with little sleep in order to devote more time into developing video games, and would frequently re-use the same mechanics of their earlier games into newer ZX Spectrum games. Reception and legacy The game received a positive critical reception upon release. Micro Adventurer mainly praised Ultimate's capabilities of developing high quality games, saying that Atic Atac was \\"bound to fix their name firmly into the minds of adventurers\\", further recommending the game \\"without reservation\\". Crash enjoyed the game's colourful graphics, heralding the detail and objects of the game to be \\"marvellous\\". However, they criticised the difficult joystick control and vague instructions, adding that the entire game is a \\"learning experience\\". Computer and Video Games stated that the game was \\"the best yet from Ultimate\\", and later in 1984 described it as \\"the favourite arcade adventure amongst computer gamesters\\". Personal Computer Games wrote that it was \\"another blockbuster game\\", while Sinclair User praised both the depth of plot and the advanced graphics, citing them both as \\"superb\\". In 1991, Atic Atac was ranked as the 79th best ZX Spectrum game of all time by Your Sinclair, Alt URL and was voted the 8th best game of all time by the readers of Retro Gamer Magazine for an article that was scheduled to be in a special Your Sinclair Tribute issue. In 2007, Eurogamer described it as a prime example of \\"what passion can do when properly digitised\\". The game was Ultimate's third consecutive number one in the UK Spectrum sales chart, following the first two Jetman games. In 2015, the game was included in Rare Replay, a collection of 30 Rare-designed games released for the Xbox One gaming console. The game was a major inspiration for the critically acclaimed CITV game show Knightmare, with producer Tim Child realising that if a ZX Spectrum could run a compelling adventure game, then a television programme with pre-rendered graphics could revolutionise the genre. Sabre Wulf, which was released for the ZX Spectrum by Ultimate Play the Game later in 1984, was noted for having similar gameplay to Atic Atac, including its similar themes of a continuous maze. In a retrospective interview with Retro Gamer, Rare designer Greg Mayles asserted that their 2003 game Grabbed by the Ghoulies was not inspired by Atic Atac, despite their similar themes of a haunted mansion.

CHAOS is a Live CD which fits on a single business-card- sized CD-ROM. This tiny disc will boot any I586 class PC (that supports CD booting) into a working OpenMosix node, without disturbing or touching the contents of any local hard disk. Designed for large-scale ad hoc clusters, once booted, CHAOS runs from memory allowing the CD to be used on the next node (and allowing for automated rebooting into the host operating system). CHAOS aims to be a compact, secure and straightforward OpenMosix cluster platform. Note that the operating system described here is not related to the Clairemont High School Advanced Operating System (also called CHAOS) which ran on a MITS Altair 8800 modified using a custom bank-switched memory controller to allow time sharing.Levinsky, Jeff L. \\"CHAOS: An Interactive Timeshared Operating System for the 8080\\", Dr. Dobb's Journal, vol. XXXI, January 1979, pp. 6-13. About =What it is= A six node CHAOS/OpenMosix cluster: The mosmon view with no load CHAOS is built around the open-source project OpenMosix created by Moshe Bar. OpenMosix itself is a piece of software that is added to the Linux kernel, to allow many Linux computers to work together as a Single System Image (SSI) type cluster. CHAOS creates a basic node in an OpenMosix cluster and is typically not deployed on its own; cluster builders will use feature-rich Linux distributions (such as Quantian or ClusterKnoppix) as a ‚Äúhead node‚Äú in a cluster to provide their application software, while the CHAOS distribution runs on ‚Äúdrone nodes‚Äú to provide ‚Äúdumb power‚Äú to the cluster. While this deployment model suits the typical cluster builder, OpenMosix is a peer-based cluster, consisting of only one type of node. All OpenMosix nodes are inherently equal and each can be, simultaneously, parent and child. =How it works= A six node CHAOS/OpenMosix cluster: The mosmon view with one process' load, launched from node two As each new node is booted it will locate one cluster node, then negotiate its entry into the cluster. If the IP address of a node is not supplied to the booting node, it will multicast for one. The first responding node will be used as the point of negotiation. The local CHAOS node initiates an IPsec tunnel to the elected negotiation node using a pre-shared key. If the tunnel fails to establish, the new node is unable to join the cluster. With the tunnel established the new node requests a copy of the OpenMosix cluster map from the negotiating cluster node. The new node then repeats this process with every node in the cluster map; establishing an IPsec tunnel, validating the cluster map, then moving on. In this way, every node is interconnected with every other node by \\"n-1\\" IPsec tunnel connections. All OpenMosix cluster communications are then said to be authenticated and encrypted via the CHAOS platform. Once an OpenMosix cluster is established on the CHAOS platform, OpenMosix can operate as if it were on any Linux platform. Any node can launch a process and have that process migrate to the node with the best performance characteristics for executing that particular process. The OpenMosix environment has the \\"mosmon\\" utility to display the performance of the entire cluster, from any node. The image series on the right shows a six node OpenMosix cluster running on the CHAOS platform. =Why it was built= A six node CHAOS/OpenMosix cluster: The mosmon view with four process' load, launched from node two CHAOS was developed to utilise idle desktop computer resources to perform pro-active brute-force cryptanalysis against given password hashes. A brute-force attack, as its name suggests, requires an adversary to employ a mammoth work effort into the resolution of a cryptographic problem. Typically, this is an exhaustive search of a particular key space. For example, resolving the password for three upper-case alpha characters would require exploring the key-space for: AAA, AAB, AAC ... ZZX, ZZY, ZZZ. In order to reduce the time required to search the key-space, portions of the work effort can be farmed out idle resources. As opposed to rainbow tables, this technique allows for brute-force attacks to be performed against irregular or salted algorithms. =Security assessed by= A six node CHAOS/OpenMosix cluster: The mosmon view with nine process' load, launched from node two The tool used to provide the cryptographic tests was John the Ripper (JtR). JtR was scaled by using named pipes to funnel a controlled dictionary (a set of keys to try) into an arbitrary number of JtR clients. Each client would take one key, encrypt it, and test it against a local copy of the hash. John the Ripper on CHAOS differed from Cisillia as it facilitated dictionary based brute-force attacks across a large number of algorithms, rather than an entire key-space driven brute-force attack across one or two algorithms. =Security provided by= CHAOS was the first OpenMosix distribution to provide IPsec and IP packet filtering to the cluster node, enabling authentication and encryption for inter-node communications, and enabling packet filtering to prevent non-cluster devices from accessing the vulnerable OpenMosix communications ports. These security controls allowed the cluster builder to utilise desktop computers in semi-trusted networks with minimal risk to cluster integrity, thus increasing the number of resources available for inclusion within the cluster. History =2003: The creation of CHAOS= The project started as tool development work for the IT Security group at Macquarie University in 2003, with an initial team that included Rob Dartnell, Ian Latter and Ty Miller. There was a need to demonstrate the weakness in one particular application's security via its one hashed, network transmitted, password. The OpenMosix cluster software, at that time, was available via a number of Linux distributions, but these were neither secure nor dynamic enough to support the campus PC environment that the cluster software was to be deployed into. The CHAOS distribution was created to fill this need, and was developed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) to allow the OpenMosix community members to benefit from the security enhancements employed around the OpenMosix software (the clustering technology that is added to the Linux kernel). Security improvements made by the team included IPsec tunnels for all cluster communications, state aware packet filtering for each node, a tiny operating system image which allowed for Preboot Execution Environment booting to remote PC memory, zero-touch cluster creation, etc. The original CHAOS project page was at https://web.archive.org/web/20050615021558/http://itsecurity.mq.edu.au/chaos/ - the original page is no longer available. =2004: CHAOS, CoSMoS and team departure= A presentation was made to the Australian Unix Users Group Security Symposium in February 2004 at about two thirds of the way through CHAOS' initial two year development cycle. In mid to late 2004 CHAOS was adapted to the Cooperative Linux (coLinux) framework, allowing OpenMosix to run as a node on a Microsoft Windows PC for the first time. This was significant as there was now the ability to run ad-hoc clusters 24x7, and not just out of business hours. The version of CHAOS created for coLinux was dubbed CosMos (Chaos-OS on Microsoft-OS) and was also released under the GPL, complete with Windows installer software. Later that year work stalled on CHAOS and CosMos when the IT Security team broke up to work for various organisations. Development was halted for most of the six months beginning Q4 2004. =2005: Relocation and public dissemination= There was renewed interest in CHAOS development when both Ian and Ty began work at Pure Hacking in Q2 2005. Pure Hacking could identify a need with the resource that CHAOS provided and offered to sponsor further CHAOS development so that it could remain under the GPL. A package updated version of CHAOS was released at that stage, but Pure Hacking provided no additional development time, leaving the project to grind to a halt again. CHAOS was \\"Slashdotted\\" during this time, due to the press that came from Pure Hacking's sponsorship announcement. Unfortunately, Pure Hacking were unable to provide the time needed to develop or maintain CHAOS. Version 1.6 of CHAOS, the only version released in Q1-3 of 2005, was released from development work performed in private time. In Q4 2005 Ian added CHAOS to the midnightcode.org web site (at the location advertised when leaving the University in 2004) \\\\- in the hope of better maintaining the project. Improvements desperately needed include code and protocol clean ups, better enterprise management support, operational documentation, and simpler integration with the supporting OpenMosix distributions (Quantian and ClusterKnoppix). =2006-2007: Redevelopment= Many of the code clean-up issues (focused on Init and Tyd, particularly) will be resolved with the integration of the Midnight Code libraries. While currently being developed these libraries already provide better program execution, configuration control, network interface manipulation and status management than those currently in CHAOS.

Details The album is often titled In a Coma: 1995-2005, and notably lacks either \\"best of\\" or \\"greatest hits\\" in the official title. It was released on September 20, 2005. However, even before its release, the album reached #1 on Amazon.ca via pre-orders, and 200 signed copies sold out from Matthew Good's official site in under four hours. The album is available in two forms: the regular version and the deluxe. The regular only includes disc one, the deluxe features two audio discs and one DVD. The first disc contains nearly all of the singles released by the Matthew Good Band and Matt solo, lacking only Good's most recent singles (\\"Near Fantastica\\", \\"It's Been a While Since I Was Your Man\\", \\"In Love with a Bad Idea\\") and the singles from the album The Audio of Being (\\"Carmelina\\", \\"Anti-Pop\\"). The first disc also contains two new songs (\\"Oh Be Joyful\\", \\"Big City Life\\"), as well as a b-side (\\"Pony Boy\\") recorded during the sessions for The Audio of Being. For the second disc, Good entered the studio solo with an acoustic guitar and recorded new versions of several songs from his extensive catalog. For added effect, Good miked the street outside the studio as he performed, adding an ambiance to the session that Good particularly enjoyed. Given the scarcity of the two MGB EPs Lo-Fi B-Sides and Loser Anthems, Good decided to add the two discs to the latter half of the second disc as a nod to fans. The DVD in the deluxe package includes every promotional video filmed during Good's career, solo and with the Matthew Good Band. As a bonus, Good recorded a commentary track with Bill Morrison, who directed the majority of the videos. The DVD also includes an animated video for \\"While We Were Hunting Rabbits\\", which was created by students at Sheridan College. After Good realized that his favourite songs had not been included in the package, a section featuring those songs accompanied by a slideshow of images similar to the cover artwork was added to the disc. \\"Oh Be Joyful\\", the first single from In a Coma, was released on July 25, 2005. The song's release was accompanied by a video that many fans found confusing, as it contained little more than a burning fireplace. Matthew Good was quick to defend his video on his blog, saying that it was \\"one of the greatest temporary musical screen savers of all time\\" and that it was only intended to appear on his site, not to play on Much Music.

History  Wabamun was named for its location on the north shore of Lake Wabamun. The first post office opened in Wabamun in 1903. In the early 1900s, Wabamun was an important railway stop for homesteaders. Many brought good and animals on train cars as far as Wabamun and then transferred to wagons drawn by oxen or horses for the remainder of trips to homesteads in the Lac Ste.Anne area.  Demographics  In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Village of Wabamun recorded a population of 682 living in 270 of its 290 total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of 661. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. In the 2011 Census, the Village of Wabamun had a population of 661 living in 265 of its 295 total dwellings, a 10% change from its 2006 population of 601. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011. The population of the Village of Wabamun according to its 2009 municipal census is 662.  Economy  The main source of income within Wabamun are power plants located in the area operated by TransAlta Utilities. The power plant within the village was closed down because of increased pressure from environmental agencies and aging. The Wabamun power plant was the subject of heated debate among the residents and cottagers of Wabamun Lake. Due to the lack of a cool‚Äìoff pond, the water used to cool the internal systems was deposited back into the lake, which enhanced the weed population dramatically. As of March 31, 2010, the Wabamun Generating Station was decommissioned, with the smoke stacks being demolished on March 18, 2017. = Tourism = A large cabin-going community exists in Wabamun during the summer, while the village is populated year round. Local sites include Wabamun Lake, Waterfront Park, the Wabamun Marina, the 380' pier and world's largest dragonfly. Businesses include 4 restaurants, hardware store, bowling lanes, post office, pharmacy, senior center, realtor, liquor store, market, car wash, laundromat, motel, hotel, Inn, tavern, bottle depot, convenience store, 2 banks, mechanic and a grocery store. There are currently plans for development to promote the community as a major visitor destination in central Alberta. These plans include further expansion of Waterfront Park, the largest boat launch on the lake, as well as Discovery Wharf, a project being undertaken that will see the development of app. 100 acres of lakefront property. The lake itself has a large population of Northern Pike along with whitefish and Perch. The main sailing club of the lake is Wabamun Sailing Club, approximately west of the village at the end of Range Road 43. A smaller club is located on the opposite shore of the lake. It is home to \\"Canada's largest dragonfly\\", a metal statue similar to other attractions to be found across the region.  Oil spill  On August 3, 2005, 45 cars of a CN Rail train derailed on the shores of Wabamun Lake, West of the village, spilling their contents of more than 700,000 litres of a variety of fuel oils and pole treating oils into the lake.

Personal life Edwin Daniel McGuinness was born in Providence, Rhode Island on May 17, 1856, son of Bernard McGuinness and Mary Higgins, both Irish immigrants. He attended public schools, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Brown University in 1877. He went on to receive his law degree in 1879 from Boston University Law School. He was admitted to the Rhode Island Bar in that same year and joined with John Doran (later a justice with the Rhode Island superior court) to form the firm of McGuinness & Doran. McGuinness married Ellen T. Noonan of Providence on November 22, 1881. She was the daughter of Timothy and Ellen Noonan. They had one daughter. Political life McGuinness was elected city alderman of Providence (1889 ‚Äì 1893). He ran for mayor in 1893 and was defeated by Frank F. Olney; he ran again in 1895 and won. In the 1896 campaign, McGuinness carried every single election district in the city. Although he ran on the Democratic ticket, he was known for running a non-partisan administration. A major issue during McGuinness's terms as mayor was a conflict with the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad Company. They had contracted to build rainsheds on their new station in Providence, but failed to fulfill this obligation. McGuinness refused to let the station open until the rainsheds were built. It was said to be a bitter fight between the mayor and the railroad. Regrettably the political responsibility took a toll on his health and he suffered a nervous breakdown during his second term as Mayor. McGuinness took ill in 1898, and even a trip south could not restore his health. He died at his home in Providence on April 21, 1901 at the age of 45. He was buried in St. Francis Cemetery, Pawtucket. In 2007 he was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame. Mayor Edwin D.

Along with the other major waterways of Chennai, the water remains heavily polluted in spite of many government efforts to clean it up over the years, including the relocation of many thousands of people from its banks since the year 2000. Heavy rains in late 2005 caused the stream to flood, leading to extensive inundation into the surrounding areas of polluted water and a subsequent outbreak of diarrhoea and vomiting. In the wake of the floods, the local administration began investigations into widening the stream to prevent recurrence of such problems in the future. In 2010, it was announced that Hydrological digital instruments would be installed along the Otteri Nullah to monitor rainfall. In 2011, the Public Works Department announced that it had started work on desilting the water body.

The station is located at the southern end of the 'diamond' junction in Chennai, where all the lines of the Chennai Suburban Railway meet. It is the first station after Chennai Central. At this station, the line divides into three: one going towards Avadi and Arakkonam, the other towards Ennore and Gummidipoondi, and the third towards Chennai Beach and Chennai Egmore. Thus, the station acts as the entry point to Chennai Central terminus where inbound trains from all the three lines are stopped before assigning a platform at Chennai Central. It also contains a railway maintenance shed with 19 pit-lines, each measuring 3-ft deep to accommodate about 24 coaches. The station has an elevation of 7 m above sea level. GMR Vasavi Diesel Power plant is situated on the side of Basin bridge opposite to the railway station. Diesel pipes are laid from Chennai Port to Basin Bridge for fuel power of the plant. The Madras Boating Club operates rowing events in this neighbourhood. History The lines at the station were electrified in 1979. On 13 April 1979, the Chennai Central‚ÄìGummidipoondi section was electrified and on 9 August 1979, the Basin Bridge‚ÄìChennai Beach section was electrified. On 29 November 1979, the lines on Chennai Central‚ÄìTiruvallur were electrified. The stabling and inspection lines at the station were electrified on 24 December 1979. The additional line between Basin Bridge and Vyasarpadi was electrified on 31 December 1985. Traffic As of 2013, the station handles about 10,000 passengers a day.

Background A small group of Englishmen in Madras (now called Chennai) founded the club in 1867. There are records to show that the club was first started in the backwaters of Ennore, and pictures of the rowing course lying alongside the sailing course are still available in the club's archives. Quite possibly sailors, with some rowing involvement back in England, devised the idea of setting up the rowing facility. Later, in 1892, the club was moved to its present location on the banks of the Adyar river. The early records of the club reveal that in 1874‚Äì75 there was a membership of about 32 rowing members and 24 non-rowing members. In 1898, the club coat of dark blue with brass buttons and the club monogram was adopted by the then committee. The original design is still in use today without modification. Inter-club and intra-club regattas were conducted quite regularly during those years, and the extensive press coverage that the sport received was indicative of its popularity. One name that figures often in the early records is that of F. H. Wilson for his sculling prowess. In 1933, the Amateur Rowing Association of the East was formed, and the Madras Boat Club was one of its founder members. In the inaugural regatta of the ARAE in 1933 at Pune, MBC won the Willingdon Fours and the Venables Pairs trophies. Through these early years, the club maintained a commendable record of participation and performance in inter-club regattas. First Indian President In 1967, M. M. Muthiah became the club's first Indian president. At that time the club had very limited resources and it strived to keep interest alive. In order to generate fresh interest in the sport, in 1966 students were brought in as members, and today they form the hub of the rowing activity. In 1967, the centenary year of the club, MBC won the prestigious Willingdon Fours at the ARAE regatta. Enthusiasm was never lacking in the club and several people have contributed to its growth. In the early seventies, Borun Chanda introduced a pattern of organised coaching and training and this paved the way for better performances on the water. It was not long before the results showed; in 1972 MBC won the Willingdon trophy and followed it up the very next year by winning all the three trophies at the ARAE regatta. Indian National Rowing Championships After a few years, the Rowing Federation of India was formed, primarily through the efforts of the members of the Madras Boat Club. In 1977 the first Indian National Rowing Championship was held in Calcutta. Tamil Nadu was represented by rowers from the Madras Boat Club. At the 1980 Nationals at Calcutta, MBC rowers helped Tamil Nadu win the gold in the Coxed Fours event. The 1981 Nationals at Pune saw one of the best performances. The MBC team representing Tamil Nadu won four of the available six Gold medals and was awarded the shield for the 'Best team in Tamil Nadu' by the Tamil Nadu Sports journalist's Association. International Games At the 1982 Asian Games at New Delhi, rowing was introduced as a sport for the first time. The rowing events were held on the Ramgarh Lake in Jaipur. Several members of the MBC contributed in conducting this major event: Chacko Kandathil was one of the Indian coaches, Gopal Madhavan officiated as an International umpire, and S. Ravi and M. V. Sriram were selected to form part of the Indian team. The year 1983 saw the Indian team participate in the World Rowing Championship for the first time, with Borun Chanda was the Chief Coach. The club had always extended its facilities to any organisation involved in the sport. Several of the nominees of the Tamil Nadu Amateur Rowing Association were permitted to use the club's facilities for the purpose of training. Female Participants Changes were in store in 1988 as women began to prove their skills in the sport. Five girls, Vijaya Chari, Arati Rao, Gayatri Acharya, Pavitra Rao and Chatura Rao (cox), began training under national coach, Chacko Kandathil. They were put through a systematic pattern of training and the girls showed the greatest commitment. The efforts paid off, and for three years they emphatically dominated the women's rowing scene in the country, winning every national event during the period. In 1989 they were selected to represent India at the Asian Rowing Championships at Chandigarh, where they won two silver medals - lightweight and open. Later in 1990, they were again selected as the lightweight coxless four for the Asian Games, at Beijing. They thus became the first all-MBC crew to represent India. Their consistent performances earned them the shield for the 'Best team in Tamil Nadu' from the Tamil Nadu Sports Journalist's Association. The eighties saw a phenomenal growth in the activities of the club. The number of members grew. What was a mere seventy-five at the turn of the century was by the early eighties over a six-hundred. This called for better administration. Again contributions came from several members. Raja Bangara, who has been President of the club for eight years in the recent past, is one of the significant contributors. He steered the club to safe waters and in the matter of finance, stood it firmly on its two feet. Modern Era In the 1990s the club witnessed sweeping changes. The club acquired a number of modern facilities, and it is today proudly one of the best-equipped rowing clubs in the country. The club acquired a full complement of the latest boats and oars from U.S.A. Today, the club faces new challenges. The very survival of the sport is threatened by the condition of the Adyar river. Besides the unchecked pollution that has been taking place, the river stands so badly silted that the stretches of water available for training and racing is far from what is required. Dredging has not only become imperative but urgent. The club finds itself in a position, unable to sort out these problems by itself and requires the active help of the government.

They may be divided into two classes: doubly articulated consonants with two primary places of articulation of the same manner (both stop, or both nasal, etc.), and consonants with secondary articulation, that is, a second articulation not of the same manner. Doubly articulated consonants An example of a doubly articulated consonant is the voiceless labial-velar stop , which is pronounced simultaneously at the velum (a [k]) and at the lips (a [p]). In practically all languages of the world that have doubly articulated consonants, these are either clicks or labial- velars. Consonants with secondary articulation An example of a consonant with secondary articulation is the voiceless labialized velar stop has only a single stop articulation, velar [k], with a simultaneous approximant-like rounding of the lips. There is a large number of common secondary articulations. The most frequently encountered are labialization (such as ), palatalization (such as the Russian \\"soft\\" consonants like ), velarization (such as the English \\"dark\\" el ), and pharyngealization (such as the Arabic emphatic consonants like ). Distinction between the two classes As might be expected from the approximant-like nature of secondary articulation, it is not always easy to tell whether a co-articulated approximant consonant such as is doubly or secondarily articulated. In some English dialects, for example, is a labialized velar that could be transcribed as , but the Japanese is closer to a true labial-velar, . It is common usage to restrict the letter to the former. Similar phones The glottis controls phonation, and works simultaneously with many consonants. It is not normally considered an articulator, and an ejective such as , with simultaneous closure of the velum and glottis, is not normally considered to be a co-articulated consonant.

It is an Ancient Greek word, important in the philosophy of Aristotle, and because of this it has become a traditional word of philosophy. It stems from a verb related to possession or \\"having\\", and Jacob Klein, for example, translates it as \\"possession\\". It is more typically translated in modern texts occasionally as \\"state\\" (e.g., H. Rackham), but more often as \\"disposition\\". General description Joe Sachs translates it as \\"active condition\\", in order to make sure that hexis is not confused with passive conditions of the soul, such as feelings and impulses or mere capacities that belong to us by nature. Sachs points to Aristotle's own distinction, explained for example in Categories 8b, which distinguishes the word diathesis, normally uncontroversially translated as disposition. In this passage, diathesis only applies to passive and shallow dispositions that are easy to remove and change, such as being hot or cold, while hexis is reserved for deeper and more active dispositions, such as properly getting to know something in a way that it will not be easily forgotten. Another common example of a human hexis in Aristotle is health (hugieia, or sometimes eu(h)exia, in Greek) and in cases where hexis is discussed in the context of health, it is sometimes translated as \\"constitution\\". Humans Apart from needing to be relatively stable or permanent, in contexts concerning humans (such as knowledge, health, and good character) hexis is also generally understood to be contrasted from other dispositions, conditions and habits, by being \\"acquired\\" by some sort of training or other habituation.See for example hexis entry in LSJ. According to Plotinus, virtue is a hexis of the soul that is not primarily related to praxis and habituation; hexis is a quality of being in an active state of possession that intellectualizes the soul in permanent contemplation of the intelligible world (Enn. VI.8.5.3‚Äì37).Stamatellos, G. (2015) \\"Virtue and Hexis in Plotinus\\", International Journal of the Platonic Tradition 9.2: 129-45 Other uses also occur, for example it is sometimes translated as \\"habit\\", based upon the classical translation from Greek to Latin \\"habitus\\", which also comes from a verb indicating having. Aristotle Being in a truly fixed state, as opposed to being stable, is not implied in the original Aristotelian usage of this word.Stasis, in Greek, was ‚Äúrest‚Äù. In fact, neither a hexis nor a dunamis are static or moving because they do not exist in the way that moving things exist (Metaphysics IX). He uses the example of \\"health\\" being a hexis. So according to Aristotle, a \\"hexis\\" is a type of \\"disposition\\" (diathesis) which he in turn describes in the same as follows... And specifically it is the type of disposition \\"in virtue of which (kath' ho) the thing which is disposed is disposed well or badly, and either independently or in relation to something else\\". The wording \\"in virtue of which\\" was also described in the same passage... In Aristotle then, a hexis is an arrangement of parts such that the arrangement might have excellence, being well arranged, or in contrast, might be badly arranged. Also see Aristotle's Categories viiihttp://www.classicallibrary.org/aristotle/categories/2.htm#8 where a hexis (\\"habit\\" in the translation of Edghill) is contrasted with a disposition (diathesis) in terms of it being more permanent and less easy to change. The example given is \\"knowledge\\" (epistemƒì). In perhaps the most important case, Aristotle contrasted hexis with energeia (in the sense of activity or operation) at Nicomachean Ethics I.viii.1098b33 and Eudemian Ethics II.i.1218b. The subject here was eudaimonia, the proper aim of human life, often translated as \\"happiness\\" and hexis is contrasted with energeia (·ºêŒΩŒ≠œÅŒ≥ŒµŒπŒ±) in order to show the correctness of a proposed definition of eudaimonia - \\"activity (·ºêŒΩŒ≠œÅŒ≥ŒµŒπŒ±) in conformity with virtue\\" Happiness Happiness then, is an energeia, but virtue of character (often translated as \\"moral virtue\\") is made up of hexeis. Happiness is said to deserve honoring like the divine if it actually achieved, while virtue of character, being only a potential achievement, deserves praise but is lower.Aristot. Nic. Eth.

The town is an administrative, economic and cultural center with machine (Vag√≥nka) and building materials industries. History The first archaeological findings are from the Neolithic. Tombs were found from the Otomani Culture of the early Bronze Age and the building structures from Hallstatt Culture from late Bronze Age. The name of Trebi≈°ov is first mentioned in 1219 as Terebus, later in 1254 as Terebes, and in 1341 as Therebes, in 1441 the sources depict as Felse Terebes, Also Terebes (Upper and Lower Trebi≈°ov). The village is also mentioned in 1330, when it received town status for the first time. The castle and the village became one settlement in the 14th century. The first written reference to the castle stems from 1254. This castle of Pariƒç (P√°rics) stood at the border of the village. The village originally was established to serve the castle. The castle was built by Terebesi family from the Kaplon clan. K√°roly R√≥bert has conquered the castle in 1317 during the fight with Peter, son of Petenye and granted the land as gift to Philip Drugeth, the isp√°n of Szepes County, but then returned to royal ownership in 1342, to the Zempl√©n County. After 1387 the castle was given by Sigismund of Luxemburg to P√©ter Per√©nyi, who soon became a \\"robber knight\\". Mathias Corvinus has overtaken the castle in 1483 and given the castle to the son of the defeated knight. As the Ottomans were approaching in 1536, the castle was reinforced, and further in 1541. The Drugeth family took over the castle by marriage in 1567, but in 1619, Gabriel Bethlen sieged and occupied it. There is a record that in 1601 there were 31 populated and 94 non-populated houses in the settlement. The P√°los religious order had monastery here between 1504 and 1530, and 1630-1781 which is still standing. The castle was once again reinforced, and Austrian forces occupied it in 1675. In 1682, Th√∂k√∂ly Imre captured it and then fled from continuous Austrian attacks, so they blew the castle up, since then it has been in ruins. In 1692 Leopold I gave his rights on the property by a donation to Theresia Keglevich. From her descendants it came into the possession of the Cs√°ky family. In 1786, the Cs√°ky family was using the ruins to build another castle in the city.Das K√∂nigreich Ungarn: Ein topograph.-hist.-statistisches Rundgem√§lde, d. Ganze dieses Landes in mehr denn 12,400 Artikeln umfassend, Band 3, Seite 271, J.C. von Thiele, 1833. This castle moved to the Andr√°ssy family by marriage in 1838 and rebuilt it in Neorenaissance style. By 1787, the population had grown to 2,366. In 1831, the city was the center of the cholera uprising, which was suppressed by the military on 5 August. In the nineteenth century, the city was impacted by the waves of migration to America. The city's economy improved in the early twentieth century, when several agricultural enterprises were established, such as a sugar processing plant in 1910. In 1911, an electric power station built. In 1910, there were 2,323 (49.34%) Hungarians and 2,181 (46.33%) Slovak from a population of 4,708. In 1929, the town became the seat of its own Trebi≈°ov County. During World War II, the Slovak population supported the partisan groups. The city was occupied by the Soviet Army on 1 December 1944. In January 1945, the Slovak National Council was formed here. The population in 2001 was 22,342, of which 87% were Slovak, 8.9% Roma and 1.7% Hungarian.

It is an example of Gothic architecture. The church has a main part and the aisle chapels. The interior is composed of the altars, murals and a triumphal arch. On the ceiling, there are painted scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary. In the church there are set two marble epitaphs of J√°nos and Imre Per√©nyi, the paintings \\"The Virgin Mary's Annunciation\\" (1780), \\"Saint Pavel Hermit\\" (18th century), \\"Saint Justin Martyr\\" (1835), a stone baptistery (18th century) and a pseudo-Rococo seat. Under the church, there are crypts of the Pereny's family and P√©ter Szap√°ry and J√∫lia Cs√°ky. =Pauline Monastery= The monastery was built in 1502, and two years later, Imre Perenyi invited the Pauline monks to the monastery. The object of the Renaissance monastery in the shape of \\"L\\" had been linked right to the church with the south wing. The monastery was reconstructed, in 1678 and in 1760. With the elimination of the Pauline order in 1786 by King Joseph II., the monastery lost its original function and has since been used for many purposes. Now, it houses the Elementary Arts School and the Roman Catholic Parsonage Office. =Immaculata= The Immaculata is a work of art of an unknown sculptor. It was erected around 1800. There are three statues: The main is Madonna trampling a snake; on her right there is a statue of St. John of Nepomuk; on her left a statue of the patron and protector from fire, St. Florian. At present, it is placed in its third place. Originally it was placed in front of the manor house. Later, in 1907, it was placed south of the church, on the edge of the city park. In the 1980s, it was restored and placed between the Roman- and Greek-Catholic churches. Mausoleum of the Andr√°ssy family Immaculata =Greek-Catholic Church of Virgin Mary's Ascension= The cornerstone of the church was put in 1817. It was built by the architect J√≥zsef Turcs√°ny during the years 1818‚Äì1825. It was dedicated in 1826. In 1886, its interior was rebuilt. There are many icons: The Death of Virgin Mary, icons of Jesus Christ, St. Nicholas, Twelve Apostles, Virgin Mary and John the Baptist. The sacristy, the art lustre and ceramic floor date to 1901, and the art windows to 1907. In the 1920s, the bell called \\"Georgij\\" (George) was added. =Ruins of Pariƒç Castle= The first stage of the construction of the water castle (probably an inhabited tower with fortifications) can be dated to the 12th to 13th centuries. Pieces of pottery that have been found confirm this. The upper polygonal construction made by stone-based bricks was built in the second stage of construction, in the early 14th century. Research has confirmed that simultaneously with the fortification on the western side, an early-Gothic palace was built. On the east side of the castle a quadrangle entrance tower was built and at the courtyard was a well, fortified by stone.yhh =The Trebi≈°ov Park= The Park of Trebi≈°ov occupies an area of 62 ha. The park was originally part of a swamp-mire forest. The park began to be laid out in the 18th century. It started as an English countryside forest with buttonwoods and other trees imported from around the world. Today, the park is used for recreation, cultural and social events, and as a historical and archaeological site. In the area of the park there are, in addition to noteworthy fauna and flora, some historical monuments. =Church of the Holy Spirit= This church is one of Trebi≈°ov's oldest. Its foundations were discovered by chance at the Centre of Young Natural Scientists in Trebi≈°ov. Its existence confirmed the records of Popes Corporals from 1332‚Äì1337. The archaeological research has shown that the church had a rectangular nave. In 65 graves, this dead were buried on their backs without coffins, and primarily without gifts. Jewels, elements of clothing and coins were found in 16 graves. These included earrings, rings, Hungarian coins from second half of the 12th century and first third of the 13th century, and three cast bronze crucifixes, which belonged probably to the Eastern Church (Kievan Rus). Based on these discoveries, the church can be dated back to the first half of the 13th century, and its extension to around 1400. Ruins of Pariƒç (P√°rics) Castle in the Trebi≈°ov park Trebi≈°ov park in the autumn months =Mausoleum of The Andr√°ssy Family in The Town Park= The Mausoleum is one of the most beautiful monuments in Trebi≈°ov. It was built in the neo-Gothic style in 1893 by the German architect Arthur Meinig. The sarcophagus is a work of the Hungarian sculptor Gy√∂rgy Zala from the years 1893‚Äì1895. The Mausoleum houses the grave of count Gyula Andr√°ssy from 1894, who was prime minister of Austria-Hungary (1867). In the sarcophagus, there are relicts of his wife Katalin Andr√°ssy. Above the sarcophagus there are two bronze cartouches with the emblems of the count and his wife. Beside that there is the tin coffin of T√≥dor Andr√°ssy (1857‚Äì1905). There is a sculpture of an angel. Near the sarcophagus, there is a bronze sculpture of Helena, the wife of count Lajos Batthy√°ny. In the interior there are the starry vault and the neo-Gothic windows. =National History Museum= In 1786, count Imre Cs√°ky started constructure on a great Baroque castle. The three-winged castle has a U-shaped floor-plan. The terrace is supported by eight Classicistic pillars. In the Baroque gable there are emblems of the Cs√°ky and Andr√°ssy families. The castle has a large French garden with a fountain and a labyrinth. From 1916, the castle housed military barracks and after the Second World War a hospital.

Neopterin belongs to the chemical group known as pteridines. It is synthesised by human macrophages upon stimulation with the cytokine interferon-gamma and is indicative of a pro-inflammatory immune status. Neopterin serves as a marker of cellular immune system activation. Neopterin as disease marker Measurement of neopterin concentrations in body fluids like blood serum, cerebrospinal fluid or urine provides information about activation of cellular immune activation in humans under the control of T helper cells type 1. High neopterin production is associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species, neopterin concentrations also allow to estimate the extent of oxidative stress elicited by the immune system. Increased neopterin production is found in, but not limited to, the following diseases: *Viral infections including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and hepatitis C *Bacterial infections by intracellular living bacteria such as Borrelia (Lyme disease), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Helicobacter pylori. *parasites such as Plasmodium (malaria) *Autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) *Malignant tumor diseases *Allograft rejection episodes. *A leukodystrophy called Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome *Depression and somatization. Neopterin concentrations usually correlate with the extent and activity of the disease, and are also useful to monitor during therapy in these patients. Elevated neopterin concentrations are among the best predictors of adverse outcome in patients with HIV infection, in cardiovascular disease and in various types of cancer. In the laboratory it is measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA), ELISA, or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). It has a native fluorescence of wavelength excitation at 353 nm and emission at 438 nm, rendering it readily detected. References * Murr C, et al. Neopterin as a marker for immune system activation.

Chryselephantine cult statues enjoyed high status in Ancient Greece.  Ancient examples  Chryselephantine statues were built around a wooden frame, with thin carved slabs of ivory attached, representing the flesh, and sheets of gold leaf representing the garments, armour, hair, and other details. In some cases, glass paste, glass, and precious and semi-precious stones were used for detail such as eyes, jewellery, and weaponry. The origins of the technique are not known. There are known examples, from the 2nd millennium BC, of composite sculptures made of ivory and gold from areas that became part of the Greek world, most famously the so-called \\"Palaikastro Kouros\\" (not to be confused with the Archaic statues known by that term) from Minoan Palaikastro, BC. It is, however, not clear whether the Greek chryselephantine tradition is connected with them. Chryselephantine sculpture became widespread during the Archaic period. Later, acrolithitic statues, with marble heads and extremities, and a wooden trunk either gilded or covered in drapery, were a comparable technique used for cult images. The technique was normally used for cult statues within temples; typically, they were greater than life-sized. Construction was modular so that some of the gold could be removed and melted for coin or bullion in times of severe financial hardship, to be replaced later when finances had recovered. For example, the figure of Nike held in the right hand of Pheidias' Athena Parthenos was made from solid gold with this very purpose in mind. Indeed, in times of prosperity up to six solid gold Nikae were cast, serving as a \\"sacred treasury\\" whose safety was ensured additionally by the sanctity accorded to a cult object as well as the presence of priestesses, priests, and maintenance staff at the temple. Fragments of a burnt chryselephantine statue sometimes suggested to depict Apollo (Delphi Archaeological Museum) The two best-known examples, both from the Classical period, are those sculpted by Phidias: the standing statue of Athena Parthenos in the Parthenon at Athens, and the seated statue of Zeus in the temple at Olympia, considered as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Chryselephantine statues were not only visually striking, they also displayed the wealth and cultural achievements of those who constructed them or financed their construction. The creation of such a statue involved skills in sculpture, carpentry, jewellery, and ivory carving. Once completed, the statues required constant maintenance. It is known that at Olympia, skilled personnel were employed to ensure the upkeep of the statue. In the second century BC, the prominent sculptor, Damophon of Messene was commissioned to make repairs on it. Due to the high value of some of the materials used and the perishable nature of others, most chryselephantine statues were destroyed during antiquity and the Middle Ages. For example, of the statue of Athena Parthenos, only the hole that held its central wooden support survives today in the floor of her temple. The appearance of the statue is nevertheless known from a number of miniature marble copies discovered in Athens, as well as from a detailed description by Pausanias. Pausanias also described Pheidias' statue of Zeus at Olympia. Here, some of the clay moulds for parts of Zeus' garments made of glass or glass-paste have been discovered in the building known as the \\"Workshop of Pheidias\\". They are the only finds directly associated with the great sculptor's most famous works and thus provide useful information on their creation. Few examples of chryselephantine sculpture have been found. The most prominent surviving examples are fragments of several burnt statues (less than life-sized) from the Archaic period, discovered at Delphi. Unfortunately, it is not known whom they depict, although they are assumed to represent deities.  Modern examples  Reproduction of the Athena Parthenos statue in the reproduction Parthenon in Nashville, Tennessee, USA. The term \\"chryselephantine\\" is also used for a style of sculpture fairly common in European 19th-century art, especially Art Nouveau. In this context, it describes statuettes, the skin represented in ivory, with clothing and other detail made of other materials, such as gold, bronze, marble, silver or onyx. For instance the sculptor Pierre-Charles Simart produced a copy of the Athena Parthenos of Phidias for patron Honor√© Th√©odoric d'Albert de Luynes, circa 1840, in ivory and gold, based on ancient descriptions. The result was somewhat disappointing: \\"it cost Luynes a hundred thousand francs to prove that Simart was not Phidias\\".\\"il en co√ªta cent mille francs au duc de Luynes pour prouver que Simart ne fut pas Phidias\\" Boissieu 1869:260. Another version of this figure, by American sculptor Alan LeQuire, stands as the center of the Parthenon in Nashville, Tennessee. In the early 20th century, German sculptors Ferdinand Preiss and Franz Iffland became well known for their chryselephantine sculptures. A number of other European sculptors also produced chryselephantine pieces, including but not limited to Jo√© Descomps, Josef Lorenzl, Georges Omerth, Claire J. R. Colinet, Pierre Le Faguays, D. H. Chiparus, Bruno Zach, and Dominique Alonzo. After the 1890s, its meaning was extended to include any statue fashioned in a combination of ivory with other materials.Art Nouveau Sculpture, Alastair Duncan References *Kenneth D. S. Lapatin.

It has many parallels with the Samara culture, and was succeeded by the Sredny Stog culture. Discovery The Dnieper-Donets culture was defined by the Soviet archaeologist Dmitry Telegin. Origin The origins of the Dnieper‚ÄìDonets culture are found in the Swiderian culture. Its people traced their origins to earlier Mesolithic foragers. The Dnieper-Donets culture appeared in the early fifth millennium BC along the middle Dnieper to the northern Donets. It quickly expended in all directions, eventually absorbing all other local Neolithic groups. Distribution The Dnieper‚ÄìDonets culture was distributed in the areas north of the Black Sea. Throughout is existence rapid population growth and an expansion towards the steppe is noticeable. There are parallels with the contemporaneous Samara culture to the north. Striking similarities with the Khvalynsk culture and the Sredny Stog culture have also been detected. A much larger horizon from the upper Vistula to the lower half of Dnieper to the mid-to-lower Volga has therefore been drawn. Influences from the Dnieper‚ÄìDonets culture and the Sredny Stog culture on the Funnelbeaker culture have been detected. An origin of the Funnelbeaker culture from the Dnieper‚ÄìDonets culture has been suggested, but this is very controversial. The Dnieper-Donets culture was contemporary with the Bug‚ÄìDniester culture. It is clearly distinct from the Cucuteni‚ÄìTrypillia culture. Characteristics =Settlements= The Dnieper-Donets culture is known from more than 200 sites. Few settlements from the Dnieper-Donets culture are known, but a few semi-subterranean huts have been found. These huts were covered in bark. =Economy= The Dnieper-Donets culture was originally a hunter-gatherer culture. The economic evidence from the earliest stages is almost exclusively from hunting and fishing. Among the sources of food hunted and foraged by the Dnieper-Donets people were aurochs, elk, red deer, roe, wild boar, fox, wildcat, hare, bear and onager. Their diet was primarily high protein, with meat, fish and nuts being consumed. From around 5200 BC, the Dnieper-Donets people began keeping cattle, sheep and goat. Other domestic animals kept included pig, horse and dog. During the following centuries, domestic animals from the Dnieper further and further east towards the Volga-Ural steppes, where they appeared ca. 4700-4600 BC. From about 4200 BC, the Dnieper-Donets culture adopted agriculture. Domestic plants that have been recovered include millet, wheat and pea. Evidence from skeletal remains suggest that plants were consumed. The presence of exotic goods in Dnieper- Donets graves indiciate exchange relationships with the Caucasus. =Art= The Dnieper-Donets culture produced no female figurines. =Burials= The Dnieper-Donets culture is well known for about thirty of its cemeteries that have been discovered. These contain around 800 individuals. It is evident that funerals were complex events that had several phases. Burials are mostly in large pits where the deceased were periodically placed and covered with ocher. The deceased was typically exposed for a time before their bones were collected and buried. On other occasions the ceased was buried in the flesh without exposure. Deceased Dnieper-Donets people sometimes had only their skulls buried, at other times the entire bodies. The variants of Dnieper- Donets burial often appear in the same pits. Animal bones has also been found in the graves. Certain Dnieper-Donets burials are accompanied with copper, crystal or porphyry ornaments, shell beads, bird-stone tubes, polished stone maces or ornamental plaques made of boar's tusk. The items, along with the presence of animal bones and sophisticated burial methods, appear to have been a symbol of power. Certain deceased children were buried with such items, which indicates that wealth was inherited in Dnieper-Donets society. Very similar boar-tusk plaques and copper ornament have been found at contemporary gravesof the Samara culture in the middle Volga area. Maces of a different type than those of Dnieper-Donets have also been found. The wide adoption of such a status symbol attests to a change in the politics of power. In later times the deceased in the Dnieper-Donets culture were sometimes buried individually. This shift has been suggested as evidence of a shift towards increasing individualism. Dnieper‚ÄìDonets burials have been found near the settlement of Deriivka, which is associated with the Sredny Stog culture. =Tools= The Dnieper-Donets culture continued using Mesolothic technology, but later phases see the appearance of polished stone axes, later flint and the disappearance of microliths. These tools were sometimes deposited in graves. =Pottery= Dnieper-Donets pottery was initially pointed based, but in later phases flat-based wares emerge. Their pottery is completely different from those made by the nearby Cucuteni‚ÄìTrypillia culture. The importance of pottery appears to have increased throughout the existence of the Dnieper- Donets culture, which implies a more sedentary lifestyle. The early use of typical point base pottery interrelates with other Mesolithic cultures that are peripheral to the expanse of the Neolithic farmer cultures. The special shape of this pottery has been related to transport by logboat in wetland areas. Especially related are Swifterbant in the Netherlands, Ellerbek and Erteb√∏lle in Northern Germany and Scandinavia, \\"Ceramic Mesolithic\\" pottery of Belgium and Northern France (including non-Linear pottery such as La Hoguette, Bliquy, Villeneuve-Saint-Germain), the Roucadour culture in Southwest France and the river and lake areas of Northern Poland and Russia. Linguistics The Dnieper-Donets culture is situated in the area which in accordance with the Kurgan hypothesis has been suggested as the Proto-Indo-European homeland. It has been suggested that the Dnieper-Donets people were Pre‚ÄìIndo-European- speakers who were absorbed by Proto-Indo-Europeans expanding westwards from steppe-lands further east. The Dnieper-Donets people almost certainly spoke a different language from the people of the Cucuteni‚ÄìTrypillia culture. The areas of the upper Dniester in which the Dnieper-Donets culture was situated have mostly Baltic river names. That and the close relationship between the Dnieper-Donets culture and contemporary cultures of northeast Europe have caused the Dnieper-Donets culture to be identified with the later Balts. Mallory includes that area within the limits of the Proto-Indo-Europeans. The precise role of the culture and its language to the derivation of the Pontic- Caspian cultures, such as Sredny Stog and Yamnaya culture, is open to debate, but the display of recurrent traits points to longstanding mutual contacts or to underlying genetic relations. Physical type The physical remains recovered from graves of the Dnieper-Donets culture have been classified as \\"Proto-Europoid\\". They are predominantly characterized as late Cro-Magnons with large and more massive features than the gracile Mediterranean peoples of the Balkan Neolithic. Males averaged 172 cm in height, which is much taller than contemporary Neolithic populations. Its rugged physical traits are thought to have genetically influenced later Indo-European peoples. Physical anthropologists have pointed out similarities in the physical type of the Dnieper-Donets people with the Mesolithic peoples of Northern Europe. The peoples of the neighboring Sredny Stog culture, which eventually succeeded the Dnieper-Donets culture, were of a more gracile appearance. Genetics A genetic study published in Nature in February 2018 included an analysis of 32 individuals from three Eneolithic cemeteries at Deriivka, Vilnyanka and Vovnigi, which are ascribed to the Dnieper-Donets culture. These individuals belonged exclusively to the paternal haplogroups R and I (mostly R1b and I2), and almost exclusively to the maternal haplogroup U (mostly U5, U4 and U2). This suggests that the Dnieper-Donets people were \\"distinct, locally derived population\\" of mostly of Eastern Hunter-Gatherer (EHG) descent, with Western Hunter-Gatherer (WHG) admixture. The WHG admixture appears to have increased in the transition from the Meslothic to the Neolithic. Unlike the Yamnaya culture, whose genetic cluster is known as Western Steppe Herder (WSH), no Caucasian Hunter-Gatherer (CHG) or Early European Farmer (EEF) ancestry has been detected in the Dnieper-Donets culture. At the Vilnyanka cemetery, all the males belong to the paternal haplogroup I, which is common among WHGs. David W. Anthony suggests that this influx of WHG ancestry might be the result of EEFs pushing WHGs out of their territories to the east, where WHG males might have mated with EHG females. Dnieper-Donets males and Yamnaya males carry the same paternal haplogroups (R1b and I2a), suggesting that the CHG and EEF admixture among the Yamnaya came through EHG and WHG males mixing with EEF and CHG females. According to Anthony, this suggests that the Indo-European languages were initially spoken by EHGs living in Eastern Europe Successors The Dnieper‚ÄìDonets culture was succeeded by the Sredny Stog culture, its eastern neighbor, with whom it co-existed for a time before being finally absorbed. The Dnieper‚ÄìDonets culture and the Sredny Stog culture were in turn succeeded by the Yamnaya culture. The Mikhaylovka culture, the Novodanilovka group and the Kemi Oba culture displays evidence of continuity from the Dnieper‚ÄìDonets culture.

Harrah's is branded with the name of its former owner and operator William F. Harrah. It is now owned by Vici Properties and operated by Caesars Entertainment. The 18-story tower and 512 rooms, plus casino make it one of the largest resorts at South Lake Tahoe. History Harrah's was first established in Lake Tahoe when William F. Harrah purchased George's Gateway Club in January 1955, for $500,000. Harrah‚Äôs Lake Club opened on June 20, 1955, which it is now Harveys Lake Tahoe. In 1956, Harrah‚Äôs Lake Club was sold for $5.25 million in cash to Harvey Gross, which at the time was the most expensive casino purchase ever. In 1958, Bill Harrah acquired an interest in the Stateline Country Club and Nevada Club across the street (Harrah's current location) and opened Harrah's Stateline Club. Also in 1956, a new radio station, KOWL, had its original radio studio inside the Harrah's Stateline Club. They were located on the upper floor. The station's transmitter and broadcast tower were roughly two miles south of the casino in South Lake Tahoe, California. The South Shore Room opened in 1959, at a cost of $3.5 million. This 750-seat showroom, whose opening act was comedian Red Skelton, made entertainment a priority at Harrah's. Vocalist Ray Vasquez 1960-1964 sang in the South Shore Room for four years, without ever auditioning after being discovered working at the Silver Slipper by Bill Harrah‚Äôs wife Scherry Harrah. In 1963, Barry Keenan, Joseph Amsler and John Irwin abducted Frank Sinatra Jr., the 19-year-old son of singer Frank Sinatra, after his performance at the South Shore Room opening for George Jessel. Portions of the Bette Midler film Jinxed! were shot on location at Harrah's in the summer of 1981 for the summer 1982 release of the film. Other locations used in the film were Harrah's in Reno, and the Harrah's Auto Museum, also in Reno. Harrah had been planning to build a hotel at Lake Tahoe for many years, but had been hindered by costs. However, in 1971, when Harrah's went public, he finally had the finances available to build his dream hotel. In 1972, Harrah broke ground on his $25-million, 18-story, 250-room hotel which opened on November 9, 1973. Each room was furnished with a fully stocked bar, bay windows, 2 bathrooms with TVs and telephones. It earned the first five-star diamond rating in casino history. The 20 story pre-cast concrete sculpted building facade was designed and constructed by Thomas J.Geever. The hotel was later expanded with 290 additional rooms in 1976. The hotel and casino were damaged on August 27, 1980, when a bomb planted by terrorist and extortionist John Birges across the street in Harveys Lake Tahoe exploded, destroying the neighboring casino. Harrah's, which was connected to Harvey's via a tunnel, suffered damage from the explosion, mostly from shattered windows. No one was injured in the explosion and both casinos were empty when the bomb detonated. In 2000, it completed a $26 million renovation to update the casino, hotel rooms and restaurants on the 18th floor including the Forest Buffet and Friday‚Äôs Station. On December 3, 2005, a shootout occurred in a private booth near the casino floor. One person was killed and two Douglas County Sheriff's Deputies were injured. Caesars Entertainment began a major effort to remodel and revitalize Harrah's Lake Tahoe beginning in 2005; they remodeled floors 12 to 15 of the hotel and remade the rooms in mini suites with large couches, dry bars and brand new decor and furniture. The remodel was completed in mid-2006. Following the hotel remodel, Caesars completely remodeled the hotel's lobby and added a food court and luxury diamond outlet signature to Caesars called \\"Park Place Jewelers\\" in 2007. In 2008, Caesars added an upscale, luxury Chinese/Cantonese restaurant called \\"Gi Fu Loh\\" to cater to their Asian customers. On October 6, 2017, ownership of the property was transferred to Vici Properties as part of a corporate spin- off, and it was leased back to Caesars Entertainment. There is access to Harveys via an underground pathway that features an arcade and live acts at Sammy Hagar's CaboWabo. References * Mandel, Leon (1981).

Born in Manchester, he played for Republic of Ireland. He was most recently a player at League Two side Chester City, where he also had spells as captain and assistant-manager. He has previously played in the Premier League for Sunderland and Wolverhampton Wanderers, and was also a former captain of Leeds United. Club career Butler was born, in Moston, Manchester and began his professional career at Rochdale in 1991 and remained with the club for five seasons before joining Bury. Here, he won promotion to the second flight in his first season. After one season in the second flight with Bury, he moved to Sunderland for ¬£1million and won the First Division championship in his first season. He featured through a full season in the Premier League in 1999/2000. However, he found himself often left out of Sunderland's first team during the following season. To gain playing time, First Division Wolves took him on loan in late 2000, a move made permanent by incoming manager Dave Jones for ¬£1million in January 2001. He was made club captain for the following season which saw the team mount an automatic promotion challenge, only to fall away in the final weeks into the play-offs, where they lost to Norwich. The next year saw Butler win a second promotion to the top flight though, as the club won the play-offs, beating Sheffield United 3‚Äì0 in the 2003 final. He remained with the club for their solitary season in the Premier League but could not agree terms of a new contract afterward and instead joined fellow-relegated side Leeds United in July 2004. He was a first choice centre-back during manager Kevin Blackwell's reign and was made captain shortly after signing. Leeds first season was one of consolidating, the following season The 2005/06 season saw the club almost regain their place in the top division but they lost the play-off final to Watford. After some poor performances, loss of fitness and the sacking of manager Kevin Blackwell, new manager Dennis Wise decided to strip Butler of the captaincy after a fall out, and he was told he was free to leave Elland Road on loan until January then on a free transfer. He duly moved on loan to League Two Milton Keynes Dons in November 2006. After returning to his parent club, he was released from his contract with Leeds leaving under poor terms with Dennis Wise, and two days later signed a permanent contract with the Dons. Butler failed to complete the season with the MK Dons though, leaving in March 2007 after only 9 further appearances. He joined Chester City four months later and quickly struck up a strong central defensive partnership with Paul Linwood, later combining playing duties with a role on the coaching staff. But he was to rarely feature after April 2008, he fell out with Chester's manager after a poor performance against his former club Leeds United in the League Cup where Butler was substituted at half time, He never played for the club again and on 1 February 2009 he agreed a deal to leave Chester and become a free agent as he continued working towards completing his coaching qualifications. International career Butler made his only appearance for the Republic of Ireland (for whom he is often incorrectly stated as having qualified via his Irish wife, when he in fact qualified through his step-father's father who was from Dublin), in a friendly against the Czech Republic on 23 February 2000. He was pitted against the big Czech striker Jan Koller, but by half-time Ireland were 2‚Äì0 down thanks to two Koller goals. Butler was substituted at half-time and Ireland went on to win the game 3‚Äì2. Butler's international career is generally referred to in derisive terms by Irish supporters and he is often nominated in fans \\"worst ever Ireland XI's\\" Personal life In September 2010, Butler was arrested for allegedly assaulting a fellow guest at a charity event at Mere Golf Club in Cheshire. Butler pleaded guilty to the assault charges in May 2011 and was sentenced to 120 hours community service.

History  = Background = Luca Prodan was born in Rome on 17 May 1953Biograf√≠a de Luca Prodan Retrieved January 28, 2017 of Italian and Scottish descent after his family returned from China: His father had set up a prosperous business in ancient Chinese pottery that became untenable after the Japanese invasion of China during World War II. In his youth, Luca was sent to prestigious Gordonstoun College in Scotland -- the same Prince Charles of England attended. He escaped Gordonstoun a year before graduation and moved to London soon after. In the 1970s London Luca worked at EMI and formed his first band, The New Clear Heads, which shared aesthetics with contemporary punk acts like XTC, The Fall, Joy Division (a name he later translated to Spanish for Sumo's first album Divididos por la Felicidad) and Wire. After living in London and Manchester -- where he was allegedly seen hanging out with Joy Division band members -- Prodan accepted an invitation from Gordonstoun schoolmate Timmy Mackern to visit his family farm in the Traslasierra zone of C√≥rdoba province in Argentina, thus helping his old friend relax and stay away from heroin (Luca was devastated by the suicide of his sister Claudia, and her boyfriend). Arriving in 1981, he started composing and recording songs at home in a portable studio he had brought from London. Later, tired of the quiet countryside life, he and Timmy relocated in Buenos Aires' Hurlingham area, interested to join the town's underground music scene. = Luca in Argentina and early Sumo = First Sumo line-up, 1981: Alejandro Sokol, Ricardo Curtet, Germ√°n Daffunchio, Stephanie Nuttal, Luca Prodan. Argentina was under a repressive military dictatorship, and many music and performing art acts kept a low profile to avoid problems with the police -- Caf√© Einstein in the Balvanera district was a favorite venue for such programmes as were some pubs in Olivos. Luca soon found musicians willing to join his then innovative reggae-rock vision.Biograf√≠a de Sumo (spanish) Retrieved January 28, 2017 Sumo's initial lineup consisted of Prodan on vocals and guitar, Germ√°n Daffunchio on guitar, Alejandro Sokol on bass, and Stephanie Nuttal (an English friend of Luca's and former member of the band Manicured Noise) on drums. The first incarnation of Sumo played mostly around Prodan's neighborhood of Hurlingham, in the Buenos Aires province, and in Caf√© Einstein. Nuttal had to return to England when the Falklands War () started, so Sokol took on the drums while young Hurlingham neighbour Diego Arnedo joined on bass. Then journalist and later media star Roberto Pettinato was a frequent guest to jam with his saxophone; he ended up joining the band fully shortly after. Because of their lyrics in English, Sumo did not enjoy extensive airplay given to other Argentine bands in the wake of the war. In spite of that, it became a pillar of the underground scene together with Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota and Los Violadores. Sumo music had different sides: hard-edged rock with an experimental touch, influenced by the sound of British post-punk acts (e g Joy Division, The Fall), funky post-punk guitars and strong dub-like bass lines reminiscent of A Certain Ratio and Gang of Four's, and a typically British brand of reggae and ska. After a hiatus due to Prodan's temporary return to Europe, the band committed fully to a rock style in 1984 and spun off the Hurlingham Reggae Band. Ricardo Mollo was added on guitar and Alberto Superman Troglio replaced Sokol on drums -- even if he stayed in the band as a vocalist, bassist (when he played bass, Arnedo played keyboards) and drummer (when he played drums, Troglio did the percussion). = Success, popularity and demise = Sumo started to become a popular act in the mid-1980s as Luca's in-your-face style caught up deeply among teenagers, even if his music could also display a mellower streak. He would shout \\"fuck you\\" randomly or sing a scathing song about dumb blondes, and immediately swoon about his appreciation for common, working class men drinking ginebra at a bar. Final Sumo lineup in 1985: Luca Prodan, Germ√°n Daffunchio, Alberto Superman Troglio (back); Roberto Pettinato, Diego Arnedo, Ricardo Mollo (front) In Sumo's later releases some Spanish language lyrics were added to the band's repertoire. Many of Luca's lyrics featured irony, wordplay and references to drugs, dance parties, sex and other aspects of young people's lives, while remaining aloof of the political and economic changes in the Argentina of the 80s. The band's history was linked to entrepreneur Omar Chab√°n, who was the owner of Caf√© Einstein and celebrated Buenos Aires alternative nightclub Cemento -- where Sumo played many times. Due to his drinking habit and vertiginous rock-and-roll lifestyle, Prodan's health deteriorated. He died of a heart attack on 22 December 1987 -- two days after their last show. After Luca's passing the band dissolved but its legacy was carried on by two bands, Divididos (led by Mollo and Arnedo) and Las Pelotas (Sokol and Daffunchio's project). Some of Sumo's outtakes and their seminal recording Corpi√±os en la madrugada -- originally sold in cassette format only -- were released commercially. Two solo cuts by Prodan recorded between 1981 and 1983 were also released posthumously, \\"Time, Fate, Love\\" and \\"Beautiful Losers\\". Tributes to Sumo include a 1995 double album fittingly titled \\"Fuck You\\" -- with famous Argentine musicians' covers of Sumo tracks.

The software includes standard word processing features such as spell check, track changes, and word count, and has various viewing modes that allow editors to visually inspect design elements ‚Äî just as it looks to the designer working in Adobe InDesign. Version 3.0 of InCopy was included in the first Adobe Creative Suite in 2003, and later versions were included in versions of the Creative Suite up until version CS6. Since 2013 newer versions have been made available only through Adobe Creative Cloud.  Viewing modes  InCopy has three viewing modes: Story mode, galley mode and layout mode. The story mode is for reading and editing text in a screen-wide view without page formatting. The galley mode displays text without page formatting but with line numbers and the same line breaks seen in the layout mode. Both galley and story views show the names of the style sheets applied to the text but do not display the actual formatting. The layout mode shows the true page design layout along with images and overset text. Although InCopy can be used as a word processor (with full printing and exporting functions), it is primarily used to integrate with Adobe InDesign. Once integrated, writers, editors and designers can simultaneously work on the same page; the designer creates the page layout with InDesign, while editors simultaneously edit different stories with InCopy, via the Adobe LiveEdit rights management system.

It was organized to protest of the policies and actions of the incumbent United National Party government. It was the first mass political action in Ceylon and the first major social crisis after independence. This event is of historical significance because it was the first people's struggle against an elected government in the country. Led by the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) and other leftist parties who called on the public to resist the government and demonstrate civil disobedience and strikes, the hartal was primarily a protest of the labouring class, and as such there were no exclusions based upon caste, ethnicity or religion. The protests saw much sabotage and destruction to public infrastructure, as a means of frightening and halting the government. This occurred mainly in the Western, Southern and Sabaragamuwa Provinces as well as other minor protests around the rest of the island. The demonstrations lasted only a day with at least 10 people killed, resulting in the resignation of the Prime Minister. Background In 1948 Ceylon had gained independence becoming a Dominion, and Don Stephen Senanayake becoming the first Prime Minister of Ceylon. In March 1952 Senanayake died which began a violent tussle between his son Dudley Senanayake and his nephew John Kotelawala for his succession. The Governor General at the time Lord Soulbury arbitrated in favour of his son. In the General Elections held in May later that year, Dudley Senanayake's United National Party (UNP) secured a majority in Parliament giving him the premiership. However the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP), and others, complained about irregularities that took place during the election and felt it had lost the most during it. =Economic crisis= The people had been accustomed to there being a subsidy on rice, which was the staple diet of the island. Dating back from the rationing during World War II, the rice subsidy was issued for ration cards and over the 1940s had become a basis for the sustenance of the local population. The United National Party had promised in the 1952 election campaign to maintain the rice prices at 25 cents a measure. Soon after the election the government faced a sudden economic crisis. In July 1952 the food subsidies were running at the rate of 300 million rupees, which was a third of the estimated revenue in the planned budget for the coming year. Ceylon was depended heavily on rice exports and the global price of rice increased because of the Korean War. R. G. Senanayake, Minister of Trade and Commerce negotiated the Ceylon-China Rubber-Rice Pact, a barter systems which allowed Ceylon to trade its rubber for rice from the People's Republic of China without effecting its foreign reserves. Although the pact was opposed by J. R. Jayewardene, Finance Minister who was pro-United States which was engaged in bitter fighting with the People's Republic of China in the Korean War, pact came into effect. It did not helped the governments financial position, with its trade surplus of 345 million rupees in 1951 turning into a trade deficit of 200 million rupees in 1952. =Social welfare cuts and the price of rice= On this backdrop, the government outlined its policy to cut down on food subsidy as it stated that continuing it would ruin the country in its Throne Speech on 7 July 1953. It proposed abolished the subsidy on rice, making the ration cards called the Hal potha (rice book) obsolete. This effectively increased the price of rice from 25 cents to 70 cents per measure with effect from 20 July. The price of sugar increased. Other social welfare measures were cut down to save government expenditure. Alter on 10 July the free mid-day meal for school children was withdrawn, postal fees and rail fares were increased. =Budget day= The proposed cuts to social welfare measures, especially the increase in rice prices were met with strong public outcry. All political parties in the opposition agitated against these measures. J. R. Jayewardene as Finance Minister in the afternoon of 23 July 1953, presented the fifth budget to parliament. A large public gathering was organized at Galle Face Green by opposition parties, presided over by S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, the Leader of the Opposition. Leaders of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party and the Communist Party of Ceylon made speeches condemning government policy. A segment of supporters and workers, who attended the meeting, marched towards the Parliament screaming and gesticulating, in an attempt to storm the House. The Police baton charged and tear gassed the unruly crowds. Small groups left a trail of hooliganism: damaged public property, stoned buses, an indication of the nastiest to come, as the leaders called a hartal on August 12. Shortly a strick was called in the Colombo harbor. Hartal =Call to action= All political parties in the Opposition agitated against these measures brought on by the government, but only the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP), the Viplavakari Lanka Sama Samaja Party (CP-VLSSP) United Front and the Federal Party called for resistance. The Sri Lankan leftist parties led by the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) called for the hartal, mobilizing the masses to resist the direct attack on their standard of living. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and Ceylon Indian Congress (CIC) supported protests against the elimination of the rice subsidy, but did not support a hartal. The Communist Party of Ceylon (CPC), who gained a seat in the 1952 elections, together with their allied party the Viplavakari Lanka Sama Samaja Party (VLSSP), also gave verbal supported to the idea of hartal, but there is disagreement about how much they participated. The more than doubling of the cost of rice was the main reason for the organizers of the hartal. The lefties parties took to agitating the working masses, with \\"factory gate meetings\\" and village level meetings in the rural areas. The two main private print-media of the day Times of Ceylon and the Lake House group, along with the state owned Radio Ceylon reported on pro-government and anti-hartal propaganda. The leftist countered with the publication of special hartal editions of weekly news sheets. =Initial events= 12 August 1953 saw the start of planned civil disobedience, strikes and demonstrations held throughout Ceylon, launched by the main non-communal trade unions, 90% of which were controlled by the leftist parties. However participation of employees of the health sector were discouraged knowing that it could affect the innocent patients. The main complaint was the proposed elimination of the subsidy on rice, but it also included the disenfranchisement of Tamils in the 1952 election as well as other election irregularities.The Communist parties did their best to avoid suggesting that the Ceylonese \\"mases\\" were united with Indian workers against the brown and white capitalists of the United National Party, but it was not difficult for the latter party to allege that the Communists wanted to swamp the country with Indians. Jennings, Ivor (1954) \\"Politics in Ceylon Since 1952\\" Pacific Affairs 27(4): pp. 338‚Äì352, page 341 Some commentators suggest that the hartal only occurred in one-third of the country. The most civil disobedience acts on 12 August took place in certain localities along the western and south-western seaboard, e.g., Maharagama, Boralesgamuwa, Gangodawila, Kirillapone, Egoda Uyana, Katukurunda, Koralawella, Waskaduwa, Karandeniya, Dompe, Akurala, Totagamuwa, Hikkaduwa, and Ragama, where there were widespread riots and extensive damage to communications and transportation facilities. Some of the damage was deliberate anti-government sabotage. In Kochchikade, police opened fire killing two persons who were preventing buses operating. In Panadura, railway wagons carrying fuel were set on fire. In Peradeniya university students clashed with police. San Sebastian saw police coming under attack by protesters. Because of the disenfranchisement of Tamils, the Jaffna Peninsula in particular participated fully in the work-stoppage, although there was no noteworthy violence reported. There were also widespread demonstrations in the 24 divisions of the Western, Southern and Sabaragamuwa Provinces in which the Emergency Regulations were longest maintained. These areas consist of the Alutkuru Korale South, Meda Pattuwa, Adikari Pattuwa, Siyane Korale, Alutgam and Panawal Korales, Colombo Mudaliyars' Division, Salpiti Korale, Panadura Totamune, Kalutara Totamune, Bentota Walalawiti Korale, Wellaboda Pattu, Colombo Municipal area, and the Urban Council areas of Avissawella, Dehiwala- Mount Lavinia, Gampaha, Ja-Ela, Kolonnawa, Kotte, Wattala-Mabola-Peliyagoda, Beruwala, Kalutara, Panadura and Ambalangoda. The hartal was primarily a protest of the labouring class, and as such there were no exclusions based upon caste, ethnicity or religion, even the Roman Catholics participated, notably in the Negombo, Wennappuwa and Ragama areas. Acts of sabotage occurred throughout the country. For instance on the railways the rails and fish plates were removed. In Waskaduwa the rails with the sleepers were torn up for over a mile, and the telegraph posts toppled over along the whole stretch. In Totagamuwa, the wooden sleepers were set on fire which warped the rails. In numerous places telephone and telegraph wires were cut. In Egoda Uyana, the demonstrators invaded the station, captured a train and uncoupled the engine so that the train could not leave. Buses particularly those of the Gamini Bus Co. Ltd. and the High Level Road Bus Co. Ltd. were stopped, stoned and smashed by the demonstrators. The principal bus routes were blocked with trees and other barriers so that military escorts were required. Bridges had their planks removed and in a few cases were dynamited. =Government response= With major civil unrest throughout the island and appearance of breakdown of law and order, the police struggled to bring the situation under control due to the sheer numbers of the crowds and rioters. The government panicked, and the Cabinet of Ministers boarded , a light cruiser of the Royal Navy that was in the Colombo harbour. There they had several sessions, including sessions with senior offices of the police and the armed forces. The Sir Oliver Gunathilaka, Governor General in-consultation with Prime Minister Senanayake placed the country under provincial emergency regulations. The armed forces were deployed to assist the police to bring the situation under control. Senanayake took ill, and Gunathilaka took command of the security forces from the Queen's House. The army began to suppress riots and hartal was eventually stopped. The hartal was scheduled for only one day, but in some cases the crowds were so worked up that they continued until the morning of the 13th. Shaun Goonewardene held that there was no intent to continue the demonstrations after the 12th, while Edmund Samarakkody suggested that the demonstrators were ready to go on only if the leadership had given them a signal. In many areas the police and demonstrators clashed and at least ten people were killed. Aftermath =Immediate outcome= Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake was badly affected by the crisis, having taken gravely ill at the height of the Hartal. He resigned as Prime Minister on the 12 October 1953 on health grounds, leaving politics and the public limelight. The United National Party remained in control of the government, while Colonel Sir John Kotelawala took over as Prime Minister. The rice subsidy was partially restored, and various foreign policy initiatives were undertaken to brighten Ceylon's image abroad, including entry into the United Nations in 1955. The hartal would eventually the apparent invincibility of the UNP government which would go on to lose the 1956 elections to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) under S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, who contested under the \\"Sinhala only\\" slogan. Dudley Senanayake return to politics and went on to serve as Prime Minister on two other occasions, for four months in 1960, and a full term from 1965‚Äì70. =Long-term effects= The 1953 hartal is of course, the central event of its history to which Sri Lanka's Old Left looks back with heroic nostalgia. For many years Hartal Day was an occasion for rousing speeches by the Left. It was an application of the classic Marxist thesis of the general strike but those who called the hartal never intended to take it beyond that stage, whereas in the Marxist playbook a general strike ought to lead to the overthrow of the government in power. But still nursing gradualist illusions of ultimately seeking parliamentary power the LSSP leaders primarily did not envisage anything like such a scenario. In retrospect it has become the traditional wisdom to say that it was not the Old Left but the SLFP which benefited from the hartal in the form of the popular upsurge of 1956 which felled the UNP and brought S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike to power as prime minister. While those who later broke away from the LSSP have all complained in varying degrees of the LSSP's failure to mobilize after the hartal for a bigger onslaught against the state, the party's official historian Leslie Goonewardene offers this explanation: \\"Most important of all, it was the considered view of the LSSP (as well as we believe of the VLSSP-CP United Front) that the mass movement had reached only a stage of protest against the actions of the Government in imposing the burdens it did on the masses, and not at a stage where it was aiming at the overthrow of the Government\\". Dr. Colvin R. de Silva had identified 1953 Hartal as a class struggle. The long-term effect was for politicians in Ceylon, and then Sri Lanka, to recognize that the laboring classes had power, and that in turn increased the coercive effect and hence political power of trade unions. Nearly two decades later, a leftist youth armed revolt took a SLFP government lead by S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike's widow Sirima Bandaranaike, who had leftist parties in its cabinet. Ironically Bandaranaike received aid from the west and the Soviet Union to crush the insurrection with brutal force.

He began working as a cashier at Walmart in 1985 in his hometown of Ada, Oklahoma. While attending college, he rose through the store ranks, to customer service manager, housewares department manager and head office cashier. After several promotions, Turner found himself in the auditing department, where he came into contact with Sam Walton. On Walton‚Äôs advice, Turner joined the company's information systems division, where he worked his way through a succession of jobs: business analyst, strategy manager, director, and then Assistant CIO. In 1995, at the age of 29, Turner became the youngest Corporate Vice President and Officer ever named at Walmart. In 1997, Turner became the recipient of the first \\"Sam M. Walton - Entrepreneur Of The Year\\" Award, which is the highest honor given at Walmart and is voted on by the Walton Family. =CIO of Walmart (2000-2002)= David Glass, Lee Scott and Rob Walton at the Annual Walmart Shareholders Meeting In February 2000, Turner became the Chief Information Officer of Walmart at the age of 34, when former Walmart CIO Randy Mott departed for Dell. Turner had previously been the Assistant CIO under Mott. As the CIO of Walmart, Turner oversaw Walmart's information technology and worldwide data-tracking system. The division consisted of over 2,000 employees in Bentonville, Arkansas. He led the team that developed retail-specific applications such as Retail Link at Walmart.

In his last fiscal year as CEO, Sam's Club turned in a 5.8 percent sales growth at stores open at least a year, which was nearly double the 2.9 percent sales growth at U.S. Walmart stores. During his tenure as CEO, Turner improved the performance of the warehouse clubs and closed the gap with Costco. Turner was the President and CEO of Sam's Club until he left for Microsoft in 2005. After his departure for Microsoft, Sam's Club named Doug McMillon as its CEO. =COO of Microsoft (2005-2016)= Turner at the Microsoft Store opening in New York City in 2015 In 2005, Turner was approached by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and CEO Steve Ballmer about overseeing the company's worldwide sales, marketing, services, and internal IT operations organization. He had previously worked with Gates and Ballmer during his time as CIO of Walmart. Turner accepted the offer and moved his wife and three children to Washington State where, in September 2005, he became the Chief Operating Officer of Microsoft (the previous COO, Rick Belluzzo, had left the company in 2002 and no replacement had been hired). From 2005 to 2016, Turner was responsible for the strategic and operational leadership of Microsoft's worldwide sales, field marketing and services organization (SMSG).

Origins  Some people with the name derive it from the town of Heilbronn, Germany. \\"Heilbronn\\" means \\"healing well\\". Besides the numerous Heilbrons, Heilbronners, Heilpruns, and Heilbruns who are known to have lived between the middle of the 16th century and the present time, there are four distinct branches of the Heilprin family. The progenitor of the oldest of these was Zebulun Eliezer, whose son Moses of Brest-Litovsk was brother-in-law of Samuel Edels (Eideles) (died 1632). The genealogy of another branch, which includes several rabbis and prominent leaders of communities and of the Council of Four Lands, is as follows: See the image The genealogy of a third branch is that made by Belinson of the family of Jehiel ben Solomon Heilprin, who went from Brody in 1821 to Odessa, where he was dayyan until 1835; he then succeeded Reuben Hardenstein in the rabbinate of Odessa, which Heilprin held until his death, January 13, 1877. The places following the names in the following family tree denote in most instances the rabbinates. The fourth branch is that of Jehiel ben Solomon ben Jekuthiel of Minsk, author of \\"Seder ha-Dorot\\", whose son Moses succeeded him in the rabbinate and whose grandson, L√∂b b. Isaac, published his work. Jehiel was probably related to the third branch of the Heilprin family. A large number of the Heilprins now living in Russia claim descent from Jehiel. Phinehas Mendel, father of Michael Heilprin, was also probably descended from one of the several prominent Heilprins who lived in his native city, Lublin. Heilprins are to be found in almost all Ashkenazic communities, but they are not necessarily of the same family, since most of the family names borne by the Jews of Austria, Germany, and Russia were assumed indiscriminately by order of their respective governments toward the end of the 18th century or at the beginning of the 19th.

Nicknamed \\"Stone General\\", he ranks 99th among the 108 Stars of Destiny and 63rd among the 72 Earthly Fiends. Background The novel depicts Shi Yong as eight chi tall and having a pale yellowish complexion, sharp eyes and a clean shaven face. Shi Yong, who was born and lives in Daming Prefecture (Â§ßÂêçÂ∫ú; present-day Daming County, Hebei), is a hardcore gambler. He flees Daming and hides in the house of the nobleman Chai Jin after killing a man in a fit of anger over some gambling matter. Joining Liangshan Shi Yong later goes to seek refuge under Song Jiang, but the latter has run away after killing his mistress Yan Poxi. Shi stays for a while entertained by Song Jiang's younger brother Song Qing. When he leaves, Song Qing asks him to deliver a letter to Song Jiang should he run into him. Meanwhile, Song Jiang has assembled a group of heroes at Qingzhou, Shandong, after getting into trouble with the local government. He decides to take them to join the outlaws of Liangshan Marsh for fear that Qingzhou would send a big force to exterminate them. On the way to Liangshan, Song Jiang and his men come to a village inn and have their meal there. Shi Yong is occupying the biggest table alone in the inn which he refuses to concede to the group. A quarrel ensues and Shi Yong proclaims that he would only give way to only two persons, dismissing even the emperor as a nobody. Those two persons, he declares, are Chai Jin and Song Jiang. Shi Yong is shocked when Song discloses his identity and apologises for being mean. He then hands over the letter from Song Qing, which conveys to Song Jiang the false news that his father has died and urges him to rush home for the funeral. Song Jiang thus breaks away from the group leaving them, including Shi Yong, to go to Liangshan without him. Campaigns and death Shi Yong is appointed as one of the leaders of Liangshan's infantry after the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly. He participates in the campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces in Song territory following amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan. In the attack on Shezhou in the campaign against Fang La, Shi Yong and Li Yun together encounter Wang Yin, one of Fang's key lieutenants. Both are killed by Wang.

In an interview with Helter Skelter, Marshall revealed that she wanted \\"I Don't Blame You\\" to be a single. However, no single was released for the song, and a music video was never made. A live version of the song, performed by Marshall on electric guitar in a forest in New York, appears on the 2004 Cat Power DVD, Speaking for Trees: A Film by Mark Borthwick. Composition and lyrics The song tells the story of a rock star who is destroyed by fame. For years, Marshall refused to comment on the commonly held theory that it was written about Kurt Cobain, the late singer, songwriter and guitarist of the American rock band Nirvana, who committed suicide in 1994. When asked who the song was about in an interview with Helter Skelter, she replied, \\"You'll have to take a guess.\\" When asked specifically if it was about Cobain, she replied, \\"It could be anybody!\\" In a 2012 interview with The Guardian, however, Marshall confirmed that the song was about Cobain. \\"I've never told anybody this,\\" she told interviewer Hermione Hoby, \\"but that is about Kurt Cobain.

The oxazaborolidine reagent which mediates the enantioselective reduction of ketones was previously developed by the laboratory of Itsuno and thus this transformation may more properly be called the Itsuno-Corey oxazaborolidine reduction. The CBS reduction In 1981, Itsuno and coworkers first reported the use of chiral alkoxy-amine-borane complexes in reducing achiral ketones to chiral alcohols enantioselectively and in high yield. Several years later in 1987, E. J. Corey and coworkers developed the reaction between chiral amino alcohols and borane (BH3), generating oxazaborolidine products which were shown to rapidly catalyze the enantioselective reduction of achiral ketones in the presence of BH3‚Ä¢THF. The CBS Reduction has since been utilized by organic chemists as a reliable method for the asymmetric reduction of achiral ketones. Notably, it has found prominent use not only in a number of natural product syntheses, but has been utilized on large scale in industry (See Scope Below). Several reviews have been published. Mechanism Corey and coworkers originally proposed the following reaction mechanism to explain the selectivity obtained in the catalytic reduction. Mechanism of CBS reduction The first step of the mechanism involves the coordination of BH3 to the nitrogen atom of the oxazaborolidine CBS catalyst 1. This coordination serves to activate the BH3 as a hydride donor and to enhance the Lewis acidity of the catalyst's endocyclic boron. X-ray crystal structures and 11B NMR spectroscopic analyses of the coordinated catalyst-borane complex 2 have provided support for this initial step. Subsequently, the endocyclic boron of the catalyst coordinates to the ketone at the sterically more accessible electron lone pair (i.e. the lone pair closer to the smaller substituent, Rs). This preferential binding in 3 acts to minimize the steric interactions between the ketone (the large RL substituent directed away) and the R‚Äô group of the catalyst, and aligns the carbonyl and the coordinated borane for a favorable, face-selective hydride transfer through a six-membered transition state 4. Hydride transfer yields the chiral alkoxyborane 5, which upon acidic workup yields the chiral alcohol 6. The last step to regenerate the catalyst may take place by two different pathways (Path 1 or 2). The predominant driving force for this face-selective, intramolecular hydride transfer is the simultaneous activation of the borane reagent by coordination to the Lewis basic nitrogen and the enhancement of the Lewis acidity of the endocyclic boron atom for coordination to the ketone. Scope and limitations =Stereo and chemoselectivity= The CBS reduction has proven to be an effective and powerful method to reduce a wide range of different types of ketones in both a stereoselective and chemoselective manner. Substrates include a large variety of aryl-aliphatic, di-aliphatic, di-aryl, Œ±,Œ≤ unsaturated enone and ynone systems, as well as ketones containing heteroatoms. Combinations of different derivatives of the CBS catalyst and borane reducing agents have been employed to optimize enantioselectivity. Scope of CBS reduction Several interesting cases are worth noting in this selection of substrates. First, in the case of the diaryl system 9, relatively high stereoselectively is achieved despite the isosteric nature of the ketone substituents, suggesting that electronics in addition to sterics may play a role in the stereoselectivity of the CBS reduction. Differences in the substitution of the alkyne moieties in ynones 11 and 12 result in a change of selectivity for the alkyne to function as the more sterically bulky substituent rather than the smaller one. For the Œ±,Œ≤ unsaturated systems 10-12, efficient reduction of the ketone occurs despite the possible side reaction of hydroboration of the C-C unsaturated bond. The CBS reduction has also been shown to tolerate the presence of heteroatoms as in ketone 13, which is capable of coordinating to the borane. =Experimental considerations and limitations= The presence of water in the reaction mixture has been shown to have a significant effect on enantiomeric excesses, and thus the CBS reduction must be conducted under anhydrous conditions. Temperature also plays a critical role in the observed stereoselectivity. In general, at lower temperatures enantiomeric excesses (ee's) are obtained. However, when the temperature is increased, the ee values reach a maximum value that is dependent on the catalyst structure and borane reducing agent used. The use of the borane reagent catecholborane, which has been shown to participate in CBS reductions carried out at temperatures as low as -126 ¬∞C with marked enantioselectivity, offers a potential solution to improving the diminished ee values obtained at lower temperatures. Enantioselectivity issues associated with the use of BH3 as the reducing agent for the CBS reduction have been reported. Commercially available solutions of BH3‚Ä¢THF evaluated by Nettles et al. were shown to contain trace amounts of borohydride species, which participate in nonselective reductions that led to the diminished enantioselectivity. Though the borohydride catalyzed reduction pathway is much slower than the CBS catalyzed reduction, the side reaction still presents a potential challenge to optimize stereoselectivity. In 2012, Mahale et al. developed a safe and inexpensive procedure for asymmetric reduction of ketones using in situ prepared N,N-diethylaniline-borane and oxazaborolidine catalyst from sodium borohydride, N,N-diethylaniline hydrochloride and (S)-Œ±,Œ±-diphenylprolinol Variations Although CBS catalyst 1 developed by Corey has become commonly employed in the CBS reduction reaction, other derivatives of the catalyst have been developed and utilized successfully. The R‚Äô group of the CBS catalyst plays an important role in the enantioselectivity of the reduction, and as illustrated in above in the Scope section, several variations of the CBS R‚Äô group have been employed to optimize selectivity. Applications Over the past couple of decades, the CBS reduction has gained significant synthetic utility in the synthesis of a significant number of natural products, including lactones, terpenoids, alkaloids, steroids, and biotins. The enantionselective reduction has also been employed on large scale in industry. Jones et al. utilized the CBS reduction in the total synthesis of MK-0417, a water-soluble carbonic anhydrase inhibitor which has been used therapeutically to reduce intraocular pressure. Asymmetric reduction of a key bicyclic sulfone intermediate was accomplished with the CBS oxazaborolidine catalyst containing Me as the R‚Äô group. CBS reduction of sulfone in MK-0417 synthesis Asymmetric reduction of a 1,1,1-trichloro-2-keto compound is the first stage of the Corey‚ÄìLink reaction for synthsis of amino acids and related structures with a choice of either natural or un-natural stereochemistry and various side-chains. Asymmetric reduction of 7-(Benzyloxy)hept-1-en-3-one leads to (S)-7-(Benzyloxy)hept-1-en-3-ol, a chiral alcohol that leads directly to synthesis of kanamienamides, that are currently researched as enamide containing enol ethers that show potent inhibition of cancer cells. The selective formation of the chiral product is achieved by (R)-CBS catalyst with 89% yield and with 91% enantiomeric excess.

Life of Saint Alena  The traditional account of Saint Alena's life, dating to the twelfth century,The Church of Saint-Denis Accessed 2012-05-10. states that she was born in Dilbeek, just outside Brussels, Belgium, to pagan parents, the nobleman Levold and his wife, Hildegaart.Saint Alina at Brewiarz Accessed 2012-05-10.Legend of Saint Alina Accessed 2012-05-11. Alena chose to be baptized without the knowledge of her parents. As a Christian, she had to attend Mass secretly. When her father discovered that she was worshipping as a Christian, he came to the conclusion that Christians had bewitched her into conversion. He sent guards to bring her home; she resisted, and during the fighting she lost one arm. She subsequently died in prison due to her injuries. Various (unspecified) miracles were claimed at the burial site of Alena's body, and one of Levold's subjects, Duke Omundus, had his sight restored by invoking Alena's prayers. An angel appeared and took the severed arm to the chapel where she worshipped. Alena's parents were shocked, but the miracles, and the witness given by her determined faith, led them to examine Christianity, and they themselves were converted. Veneration of Saint Alena Sint-Alenatoren (left) with De Viron Castle on the background The Blind Leading the Blind by Pieter Breughel the Elder In the background is the church of Saint Alena of Dilbeek Belgium The Bishop of Cambrai gave permission for Abbot Godeschalk of Affligem Abbey to enshrine Alena's remains in the Priory of Forest, then a dependency of Affligem, as the relics of a saint on Pentecost Sunday, 19 May 1193. This was effectively a canonisation. The chapel with Alena's relics became a popular place of pilgrimage. Her shrine became incorporated into the parish church of Forest as a chapel which held her cenotaph and relics. By around 1600, her jawbone and upper arm were preserved in the parish church, each in its own jewel-studded reliquary dating from the 15th century. The rest of the bones, with the exception of the collarbones, were preserved in the abbey church in a Baroque reliquary (1644) commissioned by Fran√ßoise de Bette, abbess 1637‚Äì1666. When the abbey was suppressed in 1796 the last abbess, Juana Francisca de Rueda de Conteras (1785‚Äì1818), removed this reliquary to a monastery near W√ºrzburg. It was returned to Forest only in 1812. The collarbones are still kept in a reliquary in the church of St Ambrosius in Dilbeek.Bart Fransen, \\"Recherches historiques / Historisch onderzoek\\", Bulletin of the Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage, 32 (2006-2008), pp. 95-101.

Located on the slopes of Mount Meron in the Upper Galilee near Safed, it falls under the jurisdiction of Merom HaGalil Regional Council. It was founded in 1949 on the ruins of the depopulated Palestinian village of Meiron, by Orthodox soldiers discharged after the war.See below. Meron is most famous for the tomb of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, and is the site of annual mass public commemoration of Lag Ba'Omer. The association of Meron with the ancient Canaanite city of Merom or Maroma is generally accepted by archaeologists. According to Avraham Negev, by the Second Temple period, Merom was known as Meron. Meron is mentioned in the Bible as the site of Joshua's victory over the Canaanite kings.Mordecai Schreiber, Alvin I. Schiff, Leon Klenicki. The Shengold Jewish Encyclopedia. p. 180 In the 12th century, Benjamin de Tudela visited Meron and described a cave with tombs, believed to hold the remains of Hillel, Shammai, and \\"twenty of their disciples and other Rabbis\\". In 1931, Meron consisted of an Arab and Jewish quarter (see Meiron). In it had a population of . Geography Meandering brook in the Meron valley Meron is noted for its mountainous terrain and valleys. Among the local attractions are the Meron Vineyards. Meron is conducive to growing grapes for wine as a result of its 600-meter altitude and chalky soil. The vineyard was first planted in 2000 and is part of the Galil Mountain Winery, headquartered in nearby Kibbutz Yiron. History =Bronze and Iron Ages= The association of Meron with the ancient Canaanite city of Merom or Maroma is generally accepted, though the absence of hard archaeological evidence means other sites a little further north, such as Marun as-Ras or Jebel Marun, have also been considered.Aharoni and Rainey, 1979, p. 225.Bromiley, 1995, p. 326. Merom is mentioned in 2nd milleniun BCE Egyptian sources, and in Tiglath-pileser III's accounts of his expedition to the Galilee in 733‚Äì732 BCE (where it is transcribed as Marum). Soundings conducted below the floors of houses excavated in the 1970s indicate the presence of even earlier structures with a different layout. While these lower levels have not yet been excavated, the possibility that they date back to the Early Bronze Age was not ruled out by the archaeologists. A handful of artifacts dating to the Early Bronze Age, including seal impressions and a basalt bowl, were also found during the digs. =Classical Antiquity= Excavations at Meron found artifacts dating to the Hellenistic period at the foundation of the site.Zangenberg et al., 2007, p. 155. The economic and cultural affinities of the inhabitants of the Meron area at this time were directed toward the north, to Tyre and southern Syria in general. Josephus fortified Meron in the 1st century CE and called the town Mero or Meroth; however, Negev writes that Meroth, another ancient town, was located further north, possibly at the site of Marun ar-Ras (today in southern Lebanon). According to Avraham Negev, an Israeli archaeologist, by the Second Temple period, Merom was known as Meron.Negev and Gibson, 2005, p. 332. It is mentioned in the Talmud as being a village in which sheep were reared, that was also renowned for its olive oil.Ben Jonah et al., 1841, pp. 107‚Äì108.Negev and Gibson, 2005, p. 330. The Reverend R. Rappaport ventured that merino, the celebrated wool, may have its etymological roots in the name for the village. A tower which still stands at a height of was constructed in Meron in the 2nd century CE. In the last decade of the 3rd century CE, a synagogue was erected in the village. Known as the Meron synagogue, it survived an earthquake in 306 CE, though excavations at the site indicate that it was severely damaged or destroyed by another earthquake in 409 CE.Safrai, 1998, p. 83. \\"One of the largest Palestinian synagogues in the basilica style\\", it is the earliest example of the so-called 'Galilean' synagogue, and consists of a large room with eight columns on each side leading to the facade and a three-doored entrance framed by a columned portico.Urman and Flesher, 1998, pp. 62‚Äì63.Stemberger and Tuschling, 2000, p. 123. Artifacts uncovered during digs at the site include a coin of Probus (276‚Äì282 CE) and African ceramics dating to the latter half of the 3rd century, indicating that the city was commercially prosperous at the time. Coins found in Mieron are mostly from Tyre, though a large number are also from Hippos, which lay on the other side of Lake Tiberias. Peregrine Horden and Nicholas Purcell write that Meron was a prominent local religious centre in the period of late Antiquity. Some time in the 4th century CE, Meron was abandoned for reasons as yet unknown.Groh, in Livingstone, 1987, p. 71. =Early Islamic to Mamluk periods= Denys Pringle describes Meron as a \\"[f]ormer Jewish village\\", with a synagogue and tombs dating to the 3rd and 4th centuries, noting the site was later reoccupied between 750 and 1399.Pringle, 1997, p. 67. In the 12th century, Benjamin de Tudela, a Navarrese rabbi, visited Meron and described a cave of tombs located there believed to hold the remains of Hillel, Shammai, and \\"twenty of their disciples and other Rabbis\\". On his visit to Meron in 1210, Samuel ben Samson, a French rabbi, located the tombs of Shimon Bar Yochai and his son Eleazar b. Simeon there. A contemporary of the second Jewish revolt against Rome (132‚Äì135 CE), Bar Yochai is venerated by Jews from all walks of life. From the 13th century onward, Meron became the most frequented site of pilgrimage for Jews in Palestine.Horden and Purcell, p. 446. In the early 14th century, Arab geographer al-Dimashqi mentioned Meron as falling under the administration of Safad. He reported that it was located near a \\"well-known cave\\" where Jews and possibly non-Jewish locals travelled to celebrate a festival, which involved witnessing the sudden and miraculous rise of water from basins and sarcophagi in the cave.al-Dimashqi quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 476. =Ottoman period= Palestine was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, and by 1596, Meron was a large village of 715 located in the nahiya (\\"subdistrict\\") of Jira, part of Sanjak Safad. The village paid taxes on goats, beehives, and a press that processed either grapes or olives.Khalidi, 1992, p.477. All the villagers were Muslim.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 176 Meron suffered relatively minor damage in the Galilee earthquake of 1837. It was reported that during the earthquake the walls of the tombs of Rabbi Eleazer and Rabbi Shimon were dislodged, but did not collapse.Neman, 1971, cited in \\"The earthquake of 1 January 1837 in Southern Lebanon and Northern Israel\\" by N. N. Ambraseys, in Annali di Geofisica, Aug. 1997, p.933, Jewish pilgrims in Meron, c. 1920. A number of European travellers came to Meron over the course of the 19th century and their observations from the time are documented in travel journals. Edward Robinson, who visited Meron during his travels in Palestine and Syria in the mid-19th century, describes it as \\"a very old looking village situated on a ledge of bristling rocks near the foot of the mountain. The ascent is by a very steep and ancient road [...] It is small, and inhabited only by Muhammedans.\\"Robinson, 1856, p. 73. The tombs of Shimon bar Yochai, his son rabbi Eleazar and those of Hillel and Shammai are located by Robinson as lying within a khan-like courtyard underneath low-domed structures that were usually kept closed with the keys held in Safad. Robinson indicates that this place was the focal point of Jewish pilgrimage activities by his time; the synagogue is described as being in ruins. Laurence Oliphant also visited Meron sometime in the latter half of the 19th century. His guide there was a Sephardic rabbi who owned the land that made up the Jewish quarter of the village. Oliphant writes that the rabbi had brought 6 Jewish families from Morocco to till the land, and that they and another 12 Muslim families made up the whole of the village's population at the time.Oliphant, 1886, p.75. Karl Baedeker described it as a small village that appeared quite old with a Muslim population. By the late 19th century, Meron was a small village of 50 people who cultivated olives.Laurence Oliphant, Haifa, or Life in Modern Palestine. =British Mandate of Palestine= Jewish Pilgrims on the way to Meron, c. 1920. Towards the end of World War I, the ruins of the Meron synagogue were acquired by the \\"Fund for the Redemption of Historical Sites\\" (Qeren le-Geulat Meqomot Histori'im), a Jewish society headed by David Yellin.Fine, 2005, p. 23. In 1931, Meron consisted of an Arab and Jewish quarter, with the former being the larger one and the latter being built around the tomb of bar Yochai. That year, there were 259 Arabs and 31 Jews. Sami Hadawi's 1945 survey, conducted toward the end of the British Mandate in Palestine, depicted an entirely Arab population. Meron had a boy's elementary school. Agriculture and livestock was the dominant economic sectors of the village, with grain being the primary crop, followed by fruits. Around 200 dunams of land were planted with olive trees, and there were two presses in the village used to process olives. =1948 War= The Arab inhabitants of Meron, then known as Meiron, were driven out or fled during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War.Morris, 2004, p. xvi, village #56. Members of Yiftach Brigade in Meron. 1948 =State of Israel= 2006 Lebanon‚ÄìIsrael War On July 14, 2006, a Katyusha rocket fired from Lebanon exploded in Meron, claiming 2 lives‚ÄîYehudit Itzkovich, 57, and her 7-year-old grandson Omer Pesachov‚Äîand injuring four others. A new barrage of rockets hit Moshav Meron on July 15; there were no injuries. Tomb of Shimon Bar Yochai Tomb of Shimon Bar Yochai, c. 1920‚Äì1930 Meron is most famous for the tomb of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, a second-century rabbi, who contributed greatly to the Mishna, is often quoted in the Talmud, and to whom is attributed authorship of the kabbalistic book of the Zohar.David M. Gitlitz & Linda Kay Davidson Pilgrimage and the Jews (Westport: CT: Praeger, 2006) 89‚Äì91, 146‚Äì149. =Lag BaOmer= During the annual mass public commemoration of Lag BaOmer, hundreds of thousands of Jews make a pilgrimage to the site. With torches, song and feasting, the Yom Hillula is celebrated by hundreds of thousands of people. This celebration was a specific request by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai of his students. It is a custom at the Meron celebrations, dating from the time of Rabbi Isaac Luria, that three-year-old boys are given their first haircuts (upsherin), while their parents distribute wine and sweets.

Nicknamed \\"Iron Fan\\", he ranks 76th among the 108 Stars of Destiny and 40th among the 72 Earthly Fiends. Background Song Qing is the younger brother of Song Jiang. While Song Jiang is famous in jianghu (the scofflaw community) for his chivalry and lives in the town district of Yuncheng, being a clerk of the county's magistrate, Song Qing keeps a low profile, taking care of their father at their suburban house and managing the family's properties. Tricking Song Jiang to come home After killing his mistress Yan Poxi in a fit of anger, Song Jiang sneaks back to hide in his father's house. Although sent to arrest him, Yuncheng's chief constable Zhu Tong lets Song off after finding him hiding in a pit in his house. Song decides to seek refuge in the house of the nobleman Chai Jin. He travels there with Song Qing. Later Song Qing returns home while Song Jiang moves to the Kong Family Manor at Mount White Tiger. He subsequently shifts to Hua Rong's house at Qingfeng Fort in Qingzhou. While in Qingzhou, he sparks a battle between his bandit friends at Mount Qingfeng and the local government. Despite having beaten the army from Qingzhou, Song Jiang, Hua Rong and the bandits of Mount Qingfeng, fearing attack by a bigger government force, decamp to join Liangshan Marsh. On the way, Song Jiang runs into Shi Yong in an inn, who has a letter from Song Qing which says their father has passed on and urges him to rush home for the funeral. Upon reaching home, Song Jiang is shocked to find his father alive and well. In fact, Song Qing has penned the letter under the instruction of their father, who fears Song Jiang will tarnish the family's reputation by falling into bad company. As it is not possible to keep his homecoming a secret, Song Jiang is arrested by Yuncheng's authorities for the murder of Yan Poxi. He is exiled to a prison camp in Jiangzhou (Ê±üÂ∑û; present-day Jiujiang, Jiangxi). Joining Liangshan Song Jiang finally joins Liangshan after getting into yet more troubles, this time in Jiangzhou, which nearly got him killed. Worried that his family will be implicated, Song, after being elected second-in-command of Liangshan, goes back to Yuncheng personally to fetch his father and brother. Song Qing thus becomes a member of Liangshan. Campaigns Song Qing is placed in charge of organising banquets after the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly. He participates in the campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces on Song territory following amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan. Song Qing is one of the few Liangshan heroes who survives all the campaigns. Although he is conferred an appointment, he declines it, choosing to return home to tend to his family's properties.

Much of his work is focused on the body. As the critic Robert Enright wrote in the art magazine Border Crossings, \\"Delvoye is involved in a way of making art that reorients our understanding of how beauty can be created\\".Enright, Robert. \\"Vim & Vigour; An Interview with Wim Delvoye\\". Border Crossings 96 (2005): n. pag. Web. 4 Jun 2010. Wim Delvoye has an eclectic oeuvre, exposing his interest in a range of themes, from bodily function, and scatology to the function of art in the current market economy, and numerous subjects in between. He lives and works in Brighton, UK. Early life Delvoye was raised in Wervik, a small town in West Flanders, Belgium. He did not have a religious upbringing but has been influenced by the Roman Catholic architecture that surrounded him. In a conversation with Micha√´l Amy of the New York Times, Delvoye stated, \\"I have vivid memories of crowds marching behind a single statue as well as of people kneeling in front of painted and carved altarpieces‚Ä¶ Although I was barely aware of the ideas lurking behind these types of images, I soon understood that paintings and sculptures were of great importance\\". Career Growing up, Delvoye attended exhibitions with his parents, and his love of drawing eventually led him to art school, the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Ghent). Delvoye has said that the pessimistic expectations for Belgian art students freed him, essentially making him realize that he ‚Äúhad nothing to lose‚Äù. Shortly thereafter, Delvoye began painting over wallpaper and carpets, coloring in the existing patterns and defying the tendency towards free expression vibrant in the art world at the time. Delvoye considers himself an originator of concepts‚Äîhe is attracted initially to the theory behind pieces, instead of the act of painting itself. After 1990, specialists directed by Delvoye have executed most of his work. In 1992, Delvoye received international recognition with the presentation of his ‚ÄúMosaic‚Äù at Documenta IX, a symmetrical display of glazed tiles featuring photographs of his own excrement. The organizer of Documenta IX, Jan Hoet claimed, ‚ÄúThe strength of Wim Delvoye lies in his ability to engineer conflict by combining the fine arts and folk art, and playing seriousness against irony.‚Äù Three of his most well known projects are ‚ÄúCloaca‚Äù, ‚ÄúArt Farm‚Äù, and a series of Gothic works. Cloaca Delvoye's Cloaca is on permanent display at the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. Delvoye is perhaps best known for his digestive machine, Cloaca, which he unveiled at the Museum voor Hedendaagse Kunst, Antwerp, after eight years of consultation with experts in fields ranging from plumbing to gastroenterology.Criqui, Jean-Pierre . \\"Eater‚Äôs Digest\\". Artforum 1 Sep.2001 : 182 ‚Äì 183 . Print. As a comment on the Belgians‚Äô love of fine dining, Cloaca is a large installation that turns food into feces, allowing Delvoye to explore the digestive process. In his large mechanism, food begins at a long, transparent bowl (mouth), travels through a number of machine-like assembly stations, and ends in hard matter which is separated from liquid through a cylinder. Delvoye collects and sells the realistically smelling output, suspended in small jars of resin at his Ghent studio. When asked about his inspiration, Delvoye stated that everything in modern life is pointless. The most useless object he could create was a machine that serves no purpose at all, besides the reduction of food to waste. Cloaca has appeared in many incarnations including: Cloaca Original, Cloaca - New & Improved, Cloaca Turbo, Cloaca Quattro, Cloaca N¬∞ 5, and Personal Cloaca. Delvoye also sold specially printed toilet paper as a souvenir of the exhibit. In 2016, 5 rolls from the 2007 Mudam Luxembourg exhibit were offered for re-sale for US$300 through an online vendor.First Dibs.com, Retrieved September 27, 2016 =Commissioned Cloaca for MONA= Previously, Delvoye claimed that he would never sell a Cloaca machine to a museum as he could never trust that the curator would maintain the installation properly. However, after two years of discussion with David Walsh, Delvoye agreed to construct a custom Cloaca built specifically for the Museum of Old and New Art in Hobart, Tasmania. The new installation is suspended from the museum ceiling in a room custom-built for it. Art Farm Though Delvoye started tattooing pig skins taken from slaughterhouses in the United States in 1992, he began to tattoo live pigs in 1997. Delvoye was interested in the idea that ‚Äúthe pig would literally grow in value,\\"Laster, Paul. \\"Bringing Home the Bacon: Wim Delvoye\\". ArtAsiaPacific 30 September 2007 : 154-159 . Print. both in a physical and economic sense. He ultimately moved the operation to an Art Farm in China in 2004. The pigs have been inked with a diverse array of designs, including the trivial, such as skulls and crosses, to Louis Vuitton designs, to designs dictated by the pig's anatomy\\".Harris, Gareth. \\"Artist Banks on Pigs and Artificial S**t\\". Art Newspaper 6 October 2005 : 1, 7 . Print. In an interview with ArtAsiaPacific's Paul Laster, Delvoye described the process of tattooing a live pig, \\"we sedate it, shave it and apply Vaseline to its skin\\". Gothic works Delvoye is additionally well known for his ‚Äúgothic‚Äù style work. In 2001, Delvoye, with the help of a radiologist, had several of his friends paint themselves with small amounts of barium, and perform explicit sexual acts in medical X-ray clinics. He then used the X-ray scans to fill gothic window frames instead of classic stained glass. Delvoye suggests that radiography reduces the body to a machine. When he was not an active participant, Delvoye observed from a computer screen in another room, allowing the subjects enough distance to perform normally, although Delvoye has described the whole operation as \\"very medical, very antiseptic\\". Delvoye also creates oversized laser-cut steel sculptures of objects typically found in construction (like a cement truckCement Truck), customized in seventeenth- century Flemish Baroque style. These structures juxtapose \\"medieval craftsmanship with Gothic filigree\\". Delvoye brings together the heavy, brute force of contemporary machinery and the delicate craftsmanship associated with Gothic architecture. In a 2013 show in New York City, Delvoye showed intricate laser-cut works combining architectural and figurative references with shapes such as a M√∂bius band or a Rorschach inkblot.

It lies in the historic county of Merionethshire/Sir Feirionnydd, in the valley of the Afon Dulas, and in the community of Corris. It is the location of Foel Grochan, a slate quarry which together with Hen Chwarel and Ceunant Ddu formed the Aberllefenni quarry, which extracted rock from mediaeval times until the beginning of the 21st Century. The quarry waste tips appear in the No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded video when Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, formerly of Led Zeppelin, performed there with their band in August 1994. The less successful Cambergi and Hengae quarries lay about west of Aberllefenni, while the Cymerau and Ratgoed quarries lay to the north, connected to the Corris Railway at the village by the Ratgoed Tramway. The Roman road between northern and southern Roman Wales, Sarn Helen, probably ran through the village; the terrace of houses known as Pensarn (head of the causeway) may be a reference to it. Sarn Helen ran north-west from the village along Cwm Hengae towards Dolgellau. The village is the site of a field study site for secondary school pupils.  History  Plas Aberllefenni (also known as \\"Y Plas\\") was a mediaeval manor house, but the older section was demolished in the 1960s and only a later wing is still standing. The quarry reservoir, Llyn Cob, was once known as Llyn Owain Lawgoch, after the last male survivor of the princely house of the Kingdom of Gwynedd. Just north of the village once stood Pont Cymerau, one of the ancient bridges of Wales, which crossed the Afon Dulas just upstream of where it is joined by the Nant Ceiswyn. The Aberllefenni Brass Band was active from the mid-1880s until the outbreak of the First World War. = Corris Railway = Location of the former station (1999) Aberllefenni railway station was a station on the former Corris Railway, a narrow gauge railway which ran from Aberllefenni to . The station was open from 25 August 1887, until the end of passenger services, in December 1930. It was the northern terminus of passenger services for the entire of this time, and the northern limit for steam locomotive working from 25 August 1887 until the railway's closure on 20 August 1948. The track was lifted between Aberllefenni and in November 1948. The site of the former station was used for the construction of council houses in the 1960s, apart from the passing loop, which was used to provide parking spaces on the road. The road serving these council houses was named Maes-yr-Orsaf (), in memory of the station. Two horse-worked tramways extended the railway beyond Aberllefenni Station: * the Aberllefenni quarry tramway connecting the slate mill in the village with the three quarries * the Ratgoed Tramway serving Cymerau quarry and Ratgoed quarry  In Fiction  Aberllefenni Station was used as the basis for on the fictional Skarloey Railway and can be seen illustrated in the book Four Little Engines.

The Potapovka culture emerged out of the Poltavka culture, and had close relations with the Sintashta culture in the east, with whom it shares many similarities. Like the Sintashta culture, its people are believed to have spoken a form of Proto-Indo-Iranian. It was directly ancestral to the Srubnaya culture, and probably influenced the emergence of the Andronovo culture. Origins The Potapovka culture emerged on the middle Volga around 2500 BC. It is thought to have emerged as a northern outgrowth of the Poltavka culture, with possible influences from the Abashevo culture. Influences from the Catacomb culture and the Multi-cordoned ware culture have also been detected. The Potapovka culture has been considered a western variant of the Sintashta culture, with which it is closely related. The area which the Potapovka culture occupied had earlier been occupied by the Khvalynsk culture and the Samara culture. Distribution The Potapovka culture flourished around the middle Volga, straddling the cultural traditions of the Pontic steppe, the Urals and western Kazakhstan. It is considered to have been part of an eastward expansion of cultures based on the Pontic steppe. Potapovka sites are eventually found also on the Don and the Dnieper. The expansion of the Potapovka culture, Sintashta culture and other cultures ultimately of Eastern European origin into western Kazakhstan and the southern Urals is believed to have occurred as an elite dominance migration. The Potapovka culture has many similarities with the Sintashta culture and the earlier phases of the Andronovo culture. These similarities include animal sacrifices (horse burials), burial rituals, chariot-gear, cheek-pieces and ceramics. Similarities have also been detected with the Abashevo culture. Abashevo vessels have been found in Potapovka graves. Characteristics The Potapovka culture is especially distinguished by the presence of bone cheek- pieces for controlling horses. Possible remains of wheels and wheeled vehicles have been observed in Potapovka remains. Unlike for the Sintashta culture, spoked wheels have not been found in the Potapovka culture. Ceramics of the Potapovka culture are very similar to those of the Poltavka culture. The same feature is noted among the Sintashta culture. Major stone artifacts include flint arrowheads. One cheeck-piece of the Potapovka culture was found to be decorated with a Mycenaean ornament. Weapons discovered at Potapovka sites are very similar to those described in the Vedas and the Avesta. =Burials= The Potapovka culture is primarily known from at least eleven kurgans that have been found. These contain around eighty burials. Potpovka kurgans measure around 24 to 30 m in diameter and stand up to half-a-meter in height. They typically contain chambers surrounded by small peripheral graves of large central burial chambers. Near the central burial complex, horses, cattle, sheep, goats and dogs may be found. Several Potapovka kurgans were constructed on top of earlier Poltavka kurans, which they destroyed. According to David W. Anthony, this is hardly accidental, testifying to a \\"symbolic connection\\" between the Poltavka and Potapovka people. An interesting feature of the Potapovka grave is the replacement of the head of the decapitated individual with that of a horse. This practice has been compared with an account in the Vedas of how the A≈õvins replaced the head of Dadhichi, son of Atharvan, with that of a horse, so that he could reveal the secret of the sacred drink. Potapovka grave goods includes decorated pottery, metal objects, bronze ornaments, and occasionally silver ornaments. Graves of the Potapovka culture are very similar to those of the Sintashta culture. They both contained paired horses and cheekpieces. Physical type The Potapovka people were massively built Europoids. Their skulls are similar to those of the Catacomb culture. Potapovka skulls are less dolichocephalic than those of the Fatyanovo‚ÄìBalanovo culture, Abashevo culture, Sintashta culture, Srubnaya culture and western Andronovo culture. The physical type of the Potapovka appears to have emerged through a mixture between the purely dolichocephalic type of the Sintashta, and the less dolichocephalic type of the Yamnaya culture and Poltavka culture. Genetics In a study published in Nature in 2015, the remains of three individuals of the Potapovka culture was surveyed. One male was found to be carrying haplogroup R1a1a1b and U2e1h, while the other carried haplogroup P1 and C1. The female carried haplogroup T1. In a genetic study published in Science in 2018, the remains four individuals ascribed to the Potapovka culture was analyzed. Of the two males, one carried R1a1a1b2a2a and U2e1, while the other carried R1 and C. The two females carried U2e1a1 and H2a1e. People of the Potapovka culture were found to be closely related to people of the Corded Ware culture, the Sintashta culture, the Andronovo culture and the Srubnaya culture. These were found to harbor mixed ancestry from the Yamnaya culture and peoples of the Central European Middle Neolithic. The genetic data suggested that these related cultures were ultimately derived from a remigration of Central European peoples with steppe ancestry back into the steppe. Linguistics The Potapovka culture is thought to belong to an eastward migration of Indo-European-speakers who eventually emerged as the Indo-Iranians. David W. Anthony considers the Potapovka culture and the Sintashta culture as archaeological manifestations of the early Indo-Iranian languages. Successors The Potapovka culture and the Sintashta culture played major roles in the emergence of the Andronovo culture. The Andronovo culture is in turn considered ancestral to the Indo-Iranians. The early phases of the Srubnaya culture grew out of the Potapovka culture and the late Abashevo culture.

It is also charged with maintaining a definitive collection of publications of all agencies of the Commonwealth and serves as a Regional Depository for United States Government Publications. Mission: \\"The State Library provides information for State Government and citizens while collecting and preserving our written heritage through materials published for, by and about Pennsylvania.\\" Location The State Library of Pennsylvania is located at Commonwealth Ave. & Walnut St. (Forum Building) in downtown Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It has been at this location since 1931 Lear, B. (2013). A State Library Transformed: Pennsylvania, 1878-1921. Information & Culture, 48(1), 26-49.. The library is open to the public year-round. History The State Library of Pennsylvania began as a social library for the senators and representatives of the Pennsylvania General Assembly Lear, B. (2013). A State Library Transformed: Pennsylvania, 1878-1921. Information & Culture, 48(1), 26-49.. Its collection of materials started on December 05, 1875, after the Pennsylvania General Assembly asked Benjamin Franklin to obtain a copy of Statutes at Large and reference maps Lear, B. (2013). A State Library Transformed: Pennsylvania, 1878-1921. Information & Culture, 48(1), 26-49.. Within the next decade, the assembly spent over ¬£1,000 on ‚Äúlegal materials as well as history, geography, philosophy, and science‚Äù Lear, B. (2013). A State Library Transformed: Pennsylvania, 1878-1921. Information & Culture, 48(1), 26-49.. For several years, the Pennsylvania House and Senate did not consult each other when gathering materials for the library Lear, B. (2013). A State Library Transformed: Pennsylvania, 1878-1921. Information & Culture, 48(1), 26-49.. Therefore, on February 28, 1816, Governor Simon Snyder signed the ‚ÄúAct to Provide for the Better Preservation and Increase of the Library of This Commonwealth‚Äù, which consolidated collections, provided a budget for obtaining materials, and allowed for the appointment of a librarian Lear, B. (2013). A State Library Transformed: Pennsylvania, 1878-1921. Information & Culture, 48(1), 26-49.. In 1822, after the capital building was moved to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the library took residence on the second floor Lear, B. (2013). A State Library Transformed: Pennsylvania, 1878-1921. Information & Culture, 48(1), 26-49.. During most of the 1870s, the library ‚Äúfocused primarily on obtaining materials pertinent to legislative business\\", resulting in a collection that was not diverse Lear, B. (2013). A State Library Transformed: Pennsylvania, 1878-1921. Information & Culture, 48(1), 26-49.. William Henry Egle, the state librarian from 1887-1898, was instrumental in diversifying the library collection. As part of his term, Egle emphasized the importance of expanding the library‚Äôs newspaper collection to include one or two papers from every county depending on their population size Lear, B. (2013). A State Library Transformed: Pennsylvania, 1878-1921. Information & Culture, 48(1), 26-49.. Egle was also influential in obtaining a larger space for the library Lear, B. (2013). A State Library Transformed: Pennsylvania, 1878-1921. Information & Culture, 48(1), 26-49.. During his term, Egle warned of unsafe conditions in the library such as fire hazards and poor insulation of electrical wires Lear, B. (2013). A State Library Transformed: Pennsylvania, 1878-1921. Information & Culture, 48(1), 26-49.. After forming a close relationship with the governor, Egle and a team of forty men were able to move more than 100,000 books to a new library building in December of 1894 Lear, B. (2013). A State Library Transformed: Pennsylvania, 1878-1921. Information & Culture, 48(1), 26-49.. In February 1897, during Egle's term, the old capitol building where the Pennsylvania State Library used to reside, went up in flames Lear, B. (2013). A State Library Transformed: Pennsylvania, 1878-1921. Information & Culture, 48(1), 26-49.. The materials that had been moved to the new building were saved, but some vital historical and legislative documents that remained in the capital had been burned before they had been copied Lear, B. (2013). A State Library Transformed: Pennsylvania, 1878-1921. Information & Culture, 48(1), 26-49.. George E. Reed was the state librarian from 1899 to 1902. During that time he created a catalog of the entire collection. Although it was not the first catalog of the collection, it was the most accurate and extensive one that had been attempted Lear, B. (2013). A State Library Transformed: Pennsylvania, 1878-1921. Information & Culture, 48(1), 26-49.. The next state librarian, Thomas Lynch Montgomery, made significant advances to the library. His tenure lasted from 1903 to 1921. He worked with other library organizations to improve access of materials to people across the state, and the state library collection was vastly diversified Lear, B. (2013). A State Library Transformed: Pennsylvania, 1878-1921. Information & Culture, 48(1), 26-49.. Montgomery was a vital influence in the development of the Pennsylvania State Archives in 1903 and in the State Museum of Pennsylvania in 1905, which were divisions of the library Lear, B. (2013).

Francesco Balducci Pegolotti (fl. 1290 ‚Äì 1347), also Francesco di Balduccio, was a Florentine merchant and politician. Life His father, Balduccio Pegolotti, represented Florence in commercial negotiations with Siena in 1311. His brother, Rinieri di Balduccio, was suspected of connivance in the disappearance of a gold shipment in 1332. Francesco Pegolotti himself was a businessman in the service of the Compagnia dei Bardi, and in this capacity we find him at Antwerp from 1315 (or earlier) to 1317. He was a director of the London office from 1317 to 1321, and is recorded (as Balduch) as having dealt directly with King Edward II. He was in Cyprus from 1324 to 1327, and again in 1335. In 1324 at Famagusta he negotiated a reduction of customs duties for the Compagnia dei Bardi and for those identified as Florentine merchants by the Bardi representative in the city. In 1335 he obtained from the King of Armenia a grant of privileges for Florentine trade. In 1331 and again in 1342 he was involved in Florentine politics as a Gonfalionere di Compagnia; in 1346 he held a higher position, Gonfalionere di Giustizia. In 1347, when the Compagnia dei Bardi collapsed, Pegolotti was among those who dealt with the consequences of the bankruptcy. Works Between 1335 and 1343 he compiled the work for which he is famous, the Book of Descriptions of Countries and of Measures Employed in Business (), commonly known as the Practice of Commerce ('). Beginning with a glossary of Italian and foreign terms then in use in trade, the Practice next describes nearly all the major trading cities then known to Italian merchants; the imports and exports of various regions; the business customs prevalent in each of those regions; and the comparative value of coinages, weights and measures. The most distant trade route described by Pegolotti is that from Azov via Astrakhan, Khiva, Otrar and Kulja to Beijing. He also details the route from Ayas on the Cilician coast of Turkey via Sivas, Erzingan and Erzerum to Tabriz in Persia.

Treeing is a method of hunting where dogs are used to force animals that naturally climb up into trees, where they can be assessed or shot by hunters. The idiomatic phrase \\"Barking up the wrong tree\\" comes from this practice.  Description  The treeing technique uses dogs to force naturally climbing animals into trees, where they can be assessed or shot by hunters. The idiomatic phrase \\"Barking up the wrong tree\\" comes from this practice. Treeing allows to see the quarry and decide if the prey should be killed, and if so with a cleaner kill, or spared. For example, females with youths may be left untouched, or quarry may be observed or tagged for research.  Use  = Hunting = Particularly used with coonhunting, treeing dogs are selected for the instinct to not cease barking at an animal after it has escaped into a tree. This method of hunting is also used for cougar and black bear. The dogs are trained to bay, not directly attack the quarry; however, it is not unheard of for the quarry to kill some of the dogs or for the dogs to kill the quarry. Usually, the quarry will climb a tree to escape the dogs after a period of chase and harassment. Blackmouth Cur use this method. Traditionally, the dogs were followed on foot by hunters listening to their barks, although some hunters now use radio direction finding equipment to follow the pack. = Research = Treeing is also sometimes performed without the intention of killing the quarry for scientific purposes (such as radio-tagging) or recreational purposes. It is especially useful for cougars, which are notoriously stealthy and difficult to capture without the aid of dogs.  Law  Treeing is considered an undignified hunting practice and illegal in many places. Treeing is illegal at least in: * Oregon * Washington State * New Mexico * Montana * California, since January 1st 2013, Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill banning hunting of bears, bobcats with hound. Natural spaces law enforcement officers urged hunters or outdoor enthusiasts to call police and report any suspicious activity they witness.

The Saturday morning block featured live-action series ‚Äì primarily in the form of scripted teen sitcoms ‚Äì geared toward teenagers and young adults, the majority of which were produced by the network's in-house production units NBC Studios and NBC Enterprises. History As early as 1988, NBC had been openly contemplating replacing its Saturday morning programming block of children‚Äôs cartoons with less expensive, in-house programming oriented towards older audiences, such as talk shows and travel-themed programs, due to increasing competition from weekday afternoon cartoons airing in first-run syndication.https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/19/business/the-media-business- nbc-considers-scrapping-saturday-cartoons.html The idea for a block specifically oriented towards a teenage demographic sprang from the popularity of the teen sitcom Saved by the Bell, which centered on a group of six students attending the fictional Bayside High School in Pacific Palisades, California. Debuting on the network's Saturday morning lineup in September 1989, Saved by the Bell was a re-imagining of the short-lived sitcom Good Morning, Miss Bliss, which originated on The Disney Channel in 1988 (the predecessor series served as a starring vehicle for Hayley Mills, who unlike fellow series regulars Mark-Paul Gosselaar, Dennis Haskins, Lark Voorhies and Dustin Diamond, did not return for the retooled series). TNBC logo used from 1993 to 2000 In 2000, Just Deal became the first TNBC scripted series not to be produced by Peter Engel since the short-lived 1993 series Running the Halls, and the first series to be shot in a single-camera format. The following year, Sk8 premiered on the block, lasting for one season before being canceled. Both Just Deal and Sk8 were productions of Thomas W. Lynch, who had previously produced several hit teen dramas for Nickelodeon. By 2001, the block was suffering from declining viewership, particularly among its intended audience of teens; much of its audience by this point was from older viewers who had left their TV on after Today ended, and by its last season, the average age of a TNBC viewer was 41 years old.

(One species, Eremophila debilis is thought to be a recent arrival in New Zealand). Eremophilas are widespread in the arid areas of Australia, especially Western Australia and range in size from low-growing shrubs to small trees. The petals are joined, at least at their bases, into a tube with the upper petals different in size and shape from the lower ones. Some species have common names including emu bush, poverty bush or fuchsia bush, reflecting the belief that emus eat the fruit, their arid environment or a superficial resemblance to the flowers of plants in the genus Fuchsia. Description Eremophilas vary in size and habit from low, prostrate shrubs such as E. serpens to small trees in the case of E. bignoniiflora. Leaf size and shape is also variable but the leaves are usually small and are often shiny or hairy. The flowers usually have 5 spreading sepals and 5 petals which are joined into a tube, at least at the base. The most common flower colours are red, purple, lilac and mauve but others are white and even green. Many species have flowers which have a combination of colours, or have spotted or streaked markings, or both. Sometimes only the petals are coloured but often the sepals are also colourful. There is variation in flower shape, the most common being two petals at the top of the tube and three below, with the stamens enclosed in the tube as in the case of E. exilifolia. Species with this arrangement are generally insect-pollinated, the lower petals acting as a landing area. Less common are those that have four petal lobes at the top of the flower, one below which is curled under the flower and the stamens extending beyond the petal tube, as in the case of E. glabra. These flowers are generally bird pollinated, the bird holding the plant stem while it visits the flower. A few others have flowers with a combination of these arrangements. As the flower ages, the corolla falls off, then the calyx enlarges and becomes coloured as the fruit enlarges. The fruits contain from 2 to 12 seeds and may lie dormant in the ground for many years until disturbed by fire, heavy rainfall and sometimes by human activity such as roadworks. Some species such as E. sturtii reproduce by suckering and have become troublesome weeds in some areas. However, many more are rare or threatened by human activities such as land clearing, pastoral activity and mining. Taxonomy and naming The genus Eremophila was first formally described in 1810 by the botanist Robert Brown in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae and the first species to be named were E. oppositifolia and E. alternifolia but Brown did not nominate a type species. The Victorian government botanist, Ferdinand von Mueller was the most influential early naturalist to take an interest in the genus and described 47 species, many of which were collected during expeditions to remote areas of Australia. Robert Chinnock is the modern authority who has named more than 100 species of eremophilas but because many species grow in rarely visited places, more remain to be named. So far, 221 species have been described but another 40 have been discovered but not yet described. The most recent additions to the list are Eremophila buirchellii and Eremophila calcicola which were formally described in 2016. The name Eremophila is derived from the Ancient Greek ·ºêœÅ·øÜŒºŒøœÇ (er√™mos) meaning \\"lonely\\" or \\"desert\\" and œÜŒØŒªŒøœÇ (ph√≠los) meaning ‚Äúdear\\" or \\"beloved‚Äù alluding to the species' adaptation to arid environments. Eremophila subfloccosa =Species list= See List of Eremophila species =Common names= A significant number of eremophilas have the term emu bush or poverty bush as part of their common names, although sometimes two species have the same common name and sometimes one species has more than one common name. Of the approximately 220 species, the following have at least one common name: ; Emu bush :E. alternifolia ‚Äì narrow-leaved emu bush :E. bignoniiflora ‚Äì gooramurra, bignonia emu bush :E. compacta ‚Äì compact emu bush :E. divaricata ‚Äì spreading emu bush :E. elderi ‚Äì aromatic emu bush :E. gilesii ‚Äì Charleville turkey bush, green turkey bush, Giles emu bush :E. glabra ‚Äì common emu bush :E. glutinosa ‚Äì sticky emu bush :E. hillii ‚Äì Hill's emu bush :E. lactea ‚Äì milky emu bush :E. maculata ‚Äì spotted emu bush :E. polyclada ‚Äì twiggy emu-bush :E. scaberula ‚Äì rough emu bush :E. scoparia ‚Äì silver emu bush, broom bush ; Poverty bush :E. abietina ‚Äì spotted poverty bush :E. anomala ‚Äì Paroo poverty bush :E. attenuata ‚Äì Connie Sue poverty bush :E. aureivisca ‚Äì Rason poverty bush :E. battii ‚Äì Batt's poverty bush :E. bowmanii ‚Äì Bowman's poverty bush :E. campanulata ‚Äì bell-flowered poverty bush :E. ciliata ‚Äì Archer's poverty bush :E. denticulata ‚Äì toothed poverty bush :E. foliosissima ‚Äì poverty bush :E. granitica ‚Äì granite poverty bush, thin-leaved poverty bush :E. maitlandii ‚Äì Shark Bay poverty bush :E. malacoides ‚Äì frontage poverty bush :E. margarethae ‚Äì sandbank poverty bush :E. metallicorum ‚Äì miners poverty bush :E. micrantha ‚Äì small-flowered poverty bush :E. parvifolia ‚Äì small-leaved poverty bush :E. pterocarpa ‚Äì wing-fruited eremophila, silver poverty bush :E. spectabilis ‚Äì showy poverty bush :E. spinescens ‚Äì spiny poverty bush Distribution and habitat Eremophilas are distributed across the Australian mainland, primarily in arid regions and the majority of species occur in Western Australia. Eremophila maculata is found in all Australian states but there are no eremophilas in Tasmania. Eremophila debilis is found in New Zealand although its appearance there is thought to be recent, most likely as a result of introduction by people. At least 229 species are found in Western Australia and about 80% of those are endemic to that state. They are most common in arid areas - in the Meekatharra-Wiluna area there are more than 50 eremophila species and are the most common shrubs encountered. A few species, including E. complanata and E. mirabilis have very restricted distributions and only occur on one or two rocky outcrops. Ecology Eremophila includes entomophilous species, with flowers adapted to attract insects, and ornithophilous species, with flowers that attract birds. Entomophilous flowers have protruding lower lips, which provide a landing area for insects, and they are often blue, purple, or white. Bird-adapted flowers are red, orange, yellow, or green, and have lobes pointing downwards which discourages insects. Bird pollinated species also tend to have longer stamens, which brush pollen onto and off the bird's head as it feeds. The fruits are eaten by emus, which disperse the seeds in their droppings although the belief that this aids in the germination of the seeds is mistaken. Some species of Eremophila, such as E.freelingii and E.latrobei are toxic to stock whereas others, including E.bignoniiflora and E.oppositifolia are useful fodder plants. Uses =Indigenous uses= Aboriginal people used eremophilas for cultural and health reasons. For example, the Adnyamathanha people used Varti-varka (Eremophila longifolia) in burial ceremonies and in initiation ceremonies. Skin complaints were treated with a mixture of emu oil and the ash from burned bark of the plant. =Use in horticulture= Eremophilas have not often been cultivated in the past, although some species, including Eremophila maculata are well known. Their rarity in gardens was partly because they were difficult to propagate or because they were rarely seen, even in nature. As methods of propagating and growing have improved, the popularity of eremophilas has increased. The beauty and abundance of their flowers, variety of foliage and habit, and extended flowering period make them attractive garden plants. They are mostly drought resistant and many also tolerant of frost, allowing them to be grown in most situations. The difficulty of propagating from seed, and also sometimes from cuttings has prevented many species from being commercially available, but most species can be grafted onto rootstock of Myoporum species, giving the added advantage of being able to grow in almost any soil type, including heavy clay. Myoporum insulare, M. montanum and M. acuminatum are suitable, depending on where the plant is to be grown. It is possible to germinate eremophila seeds but the process involves either leaving the fruit in the ground for long periods or removing the seed from the fruit without damaging the seed. In nature, most eremophila grow where rainfall is infrequent and are adapted to dealing with long dry spells, even droughts lasting years. Eremophilas are therefore suited to low maintenance gardens, those where water supply is limited or where gardeners want a garden that does not require large volumes of water. In fact, excessive water can kill many species. In a severe drought, some species, such as E. microtheca can lose their leaves and appear to be dead after a long dry period, only to recover and turn into a compact, healthy-looking shrub after a deep watering. Most also grow in nutrient-poor soil, and fertiliser is rarely needed or beneficial.

Its members are Richard Egan (bass), Niall Byrne (guitar) & Matthew Bolger (guitar). Past members include Mervyn Craig (drums), Neil O'Connor (keyboards, percussion) & Glenn Keating (keyboards, percussion). History The Redneck Manifesto formed in August 1998 as a four-piece band. The band members had previously played separately in several Dublin bands - Niall Byrne in Jackbeast, Richie Egan in Black Belt Jones and Sir Killalot, and Matthew Bolger in The Waltons. Mervyn Craig had played in the Dundalk band Hylton Weir. Neil O'Connor joined the band in 2003, having previously played with the Connect 4 Orchestra. The band first started playing gigs in Dublin and released a number of 7\\" singles on their own Greyslate label; as well as a split 7\\" released on Road Relish. Their debut album Thirtysixstrings was recorded by Alan O'Boyle (Decal/Legion of Two) and released as a joint venture with French label Red F Records in 2001. It was well received by press and fans, and was acclaimed 'Irish album of the year' for 2001 by the Event Guide (Dublin). In March 2002 the band undertook their first headline European tour. In a bid to help defray tour costs they released a companion piece to 'Thirty Six Strings' in the form of an extended EP Cut Your Heart Off from Your Head. This was again recorded with producer Alan O'Boyle. Equally receiving very favourable reviews, and again being self-released, the band found it difficult to keep up with the sales demands the EP placed on them. In 2003 The Redneck Manifesto played to a capacity audience at the Witness festival in Ireland. Also in March that year, having featured on a number of BMX video soundtracks and received interest from the US BMX-ing community they travelled to play their first shows in the US, and at the 2003 South by South West music festival in Texas. In March 2004 the band travelled to France to record their third album I Am Brazil. The album was recorded in Black Box Studios by producer Dave Odlum. It was the first recording as a five-piece band and as such shows an expanded and developed sound that moves on from 'Cut Your Heart Off From Your Head'. In 2006 the band released an EP RMNMN. It was intended as a free CDEP for those who attended their Vicar Street headline gig in 2006. The CD was meant to be available soon after the gig but due to financial and CD pressing issues, the release was pushed back from its June 1, 2006, release date. Owing to the number of lost tickets (tickets were required to collect the CD) the band put the EP up for download on their website along with hi res versions of the artwork. The EP also increased from being a two-track EP to a five-track with each member contributing a track. Bulletin posted to their MySpace Regarded as one of Ireland's finest live bands, the group are resolutely independent and have repeatedly bypassed normal music industry channels. The successes they have achieved to date - sold-out venues and snapped-up recordings issued on their own label - have been based entirely on their own merits, hard work and a phenomenal word-of-mouth reputation. On 23 November 2008 a bulletin was posted on their MySpace page stating that they were working on an album and hoping to release it early the following year. In March 2010 the record Friendship was finally released. In May 2014, it emerged that two of the members, Egan and Bolger were living in Malm√∂ in Sweden and had formed a new band called Dimman. Their first two-track EP was released on 21 May 2014. Their next album, The How, was recorded in June 2017 in Donegal and was released in 2018. ‚ÄúThe Rednecks has always been pure, a joyful thing, playing together for the purity of hearing what each other is going to play.\\" Richie Egan told GoldenPlec in an interview promoting their 20th anniversary show in Vicar Street on November 30th, 2018.

There has long been a distinct Catholic strain in English literature. The most notable figures are Cardinal Newman, a convert, one of the leading prose writers of his time and also a substantial poet, and the priest-poet Gerard Manley Hopkins, also a convert, although most the latter's works were only published many years after his death. In the early 20th century, G. K. Chesterton, a convert, and Hilaire Belloc, a French-born Catholic who became a British subject, promoted Roman Catholic views in direct apologetics as well as in popular, lighter genres, such as Chesterton's \\"Father Brown\\" detective stories. From the 1930s on the \\"Catholic novel\\" became a force impossible to ignore, with leading novelists of the day, Evelyn Waugh and Graham Greene, converts both, dealing with distinctively Catholic themes in their work. Although James Hanley was not a practising Catholic, a number of his novels emphasise Catholic beliefs and values, including The Furys Chronicle. In America, Flannery O'Connor wrote powerful short stories with a Catholic sensibility and focus, set in the American South where she was decidedly in the religious minority.

Plants in the genus Prostanthera are usually shrubs, rarely trees with leaves in opposite pairs, flowers arranged in panicles in leaf axils or on the ends of branchlets, the sepals joined at the base with two lobes, the petals usually blue to purple or white, joined in a tube with two \\"lips\\", the lower lip with three lobes and the upper lip with two lobes or notched. Description Plants in the genus Prostanthera are usually shrubs or subshrubs, rarely trees, with leaves arranged in opposite pairs. The flowers are arranged in panicles in leaf axils or on the ends of branchlets with bracts and bracteoles at the base. The sepals are joined at the base but with two lobes. The petals form a tube with two lips, the lower lip with three, usually spreading lobes and the upper lip with two lobes or a notch at the tip. The petal tube is bluish purple to white or more or less red. There are four stamens, the anthers often with a small appendage. The ovary has four lobes and the tip of the stigma has two branches. Taxonomy The genus Prostanthera was first formally described in 1806 by Jacques Labillardi√®re in his book Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen and the first species he described was Prostanthera lasianthos. The word is derived from the Greek for an appendage. Within the flowers are small spur-like appendages on the anthers.Les Robinson, Field Guide to the Native Plants of Sydney, page 180 Ecology Prostanthera species are used as food plants by the larvae of hepialid moths of the genus Aenetus including A. eximia and A. ligniveren. Uses Mint bushes are cultivated as ornamentals and for essential oils and spices.

These regions are bounded by Stokes line or anti-Stokes lines. Stokes lines and anti-Stokes lines Somewhat confusingly, mathematicians and physicists use the terms \\"Stokes line\\" and \\"anti-Stokes line\\" in opposite ways. The lines originally studied by Stokes are what some mathematicians call anti-Stokes lines and what physicists call Stokes lines. (These terms are also used in optics for the unrelated Stokes lines and anti-Stokes lines in Raman scattering). This article uses the physicist's convention, which is historically more accurate and seems to be becoming more common among mathematicians. recommends the term \\"principal curve\\" for (physicist's) anti- Stokes lines. Informally the anti-Stokes lines are roughly where some term in the asymptotic expansion changes from increasing to decreasing (and therefore can exhibit a purely oscillatory behavior), and the Stokes lines are lines along which some term approaches infinity or zero fastest. Anti-Stokes lines bound regions where the function exhibit a particular asymptotic behavior. The Stokes lines and anti-Stokes lines are not unique and do not really have a precise definition in general, because the region where a function has a given asymptotic behavior is a somewhat vague concept. However the lines do usually have well determined directions at essential singularities of the function, and there is sometimes a natural choice of these lines as follows. The asymptotic expansion of a function is often given by a linear combination of functions of the form f(z)e¬±g(z) for functions f and g. The Stokes lines can then be taken as the zeros of the imaginary part of g, and the anti-Stokes lines as the zeros of the real part of g. (This is not quite canonical, because one can add a constant to g, changing the lines.) If the lines are defined like this then they are orthogonal where they meet, unless g has a multiple zero. As a trivial example, the function sinh(z) has two regions Re(z) > 0 and Re(z) < 0 where it is asymptotic to ez/2 and ‚àíe‚àíz/2. So the anti-Stokes line can be taken to be the imaginary axis, and the Stokes line can be taken to be the real axis. One could equally well take the Stokes line to be any line of given imaginary part; these choices differ only by a vertical shift, showing that there is no canonical choice for the Stokes line. Example: the Airy function The Airy function Ai(x) is one of two solutions to a simple differential equation :y - xy = 0 , \\\\, which it is often useful to approximate for many values of x - including complex values. For large x of given argument the solution can be approximated by a linear combination of the functions :\\\\frac{e^{\\\\pm\\\\frac23x^{3/2}}}{x^{1/4}}. However the linear combination has to change as the argument of x passes certain values because these approximations are multi-valued functions but the Airy function is single valued. For example, if we regard the limit of x as large and real, and would like to approximate the Airy function for both positive and negative values, we would find that Plot of Ai(x) in red and Bi(x) in blue : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathrm{Ai}(x) &{}\\\\sim \\\\frac{e^{-\\\\frac23x^{3/2}}}{2\\\\sqrt\\\\pi\\\\,x^{1/4}}  \\\\mathrm{Ai}(-x) &{}\\\\sim \\\\frac{\\\\sin(\\\\frac23x^{3/2}+\\\\frac14\\\\pi)}{\\\\sqrt\\\\pi\\\\,x^{1/4}}  \\\\end{align} Stokes lines and anti-Stokes lines for the Airy function which are two very different expressions. What has happened is that as we have increased the argument of x from 0 to pi (rotating it around through the upper half complex plane) we have crossed an anti-Stokes line, which in this case is at \\\\operatorname{arg}\\\\, x = \\\\pi / 3. At this anti-Stokes line, the coefficient of \\\\frac{e^{-\\\\frac23x^{3/2}}}{x^{1/4}} is forced to jump. The coefficient of \\\\frac{e^{+\\\\frac23x^{3/2}}}{x^{1/4}} can jump at this line but is not forced to; it can change gradually as arg x varies from œÄ/3 to œÄ as it is not determined in this region. There are three anti-Stokes lines with arguments œÄ/3, œÄ. ‚ÄìœÄ/3, and three Stokes lines with arguments 2œÄ/3, 0. ‚Äì2œÄ/3. Example: second order linear differential equations The Airy function example can be generalized to a broad class of second order linear differential equations as follows. By standard changes of variables, a second order equation can often be changed to one of the form : \\\\frac{d^2w}{dz^2} = f(z)w where f is holomorphic in a simply-connected region and w is a solution of the differential equation. Then in some cases the WKB method gives an asymptotic approximation for w as a linear combination of functions of the form : \\\\frac{\\\\exp{\\\\pm\\\\int_a^z\\\\sqrt{f(z')} \\\\, dz'}}{f(z)^{1/4}} for some constant a. (Choosing different values of a is equivalent to choosing different coefficients in the linear combination.) The anti-Stokes lines and Stokes lines are then the zeros of the real and imaginary parts, respectively, of : \\\\int_a^z\\\\sqrt{f(z)} \\\\, dz. If a is a simple zero of f then locally f looks like f'(a)(z-a). Solutions will locally behave like the Airy functions; they will have three Stokes lines and three anti-Stokes lines meeting at a.

Benefits equal approximately 70% of earnings and have a maximum per week, for a total of up to six weeks. The Paid Family Leave program is administered by the State Disability Insurance (SDI) program of the Employment Development Department.EDD. About the Paid Family Leave Insurance Program. Retrieved July 21, 2008. Benefits commenced on July 1, 2004. The PFL insurance program is fully funded by employees' contributions, similar to the SDI program. The statute states that PFL must be taken concurrently with leave under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and the California Family Rights Act (CFRA), both of which provide for twelve weeks of unpaid leave in a twelve-month period. In other words, the FMLA and CFRA offer job protection for up to twelve weeks of family leave whereas PFL offers compensation for up to eight weeks. History In 2002, after an extended campaign by the California Labor Federation, AFL-CIO http://www.californialabor.org and the Work and Family Coalition led by the Labor Project for Working Families,Netsy Firestein and Nicola Dones, \\"Unions Fight for Work and Family Policies--Not for Women Only,\\" in The Sex of Class: Women Transforming American Labor ed. Dorothy Sue Cobble, pp. 140-154. Cornell University Press, 2007. California was the first state to pass a law requiring the Paid Family Leave program.Jones, Gregg. Davis to sign bill allowing paid family leave. Los Angeles Times, September 23, 2002. As of mid-2008, the only other states that had passed laws to offer paid family leave benefits were Washington and New Jersey.Lu, Adrienne. Paid family leave now law in N.J. Philadelphia Inquirer, May 3, 2008. Retrieved July 21, 2008. In 2009, five years after California's paid family leave law first went into effect, Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey, a Democrat from the same state, introduced H.R. 2339, the Family Income Responding to Significant Transitions (FIRST) Act, which would provide federal grants to states with existing paid family leave laws to implement and administer their paid family leave programs, and would encourage other states to develop their own paid family leave programs.http://www.paidfamilyleave.org/press/press_release_5th.pdf Provisions In order to qualify for PFL, employees must participate in the State Disability Insurance (SDI) Program (or a voluntary plan in lieu of SDI). Benefits under the program include the following: * PFL allows for up to six weeks of paid leave in a twelve-month period. * PFL covers employees who take time off to bond with their own child or their registered domestic partner's child, or a child placed for adoption or foster-care with them or their domestic partner. Eligibility expires one year from the minor child's date of birth, adoption, or foster care placement. * PFL also covers employees who take time off to care for a seriously ill child, parent, spouse or domestic partner. =Exclusions= An employee may not receive PFL insurance benefits if he or she is also eligible for or already receiving State Disability Insurance, Unemployment Compensation Insurance, or Workers' Compensation. An employer may require employees to take up to two weeks earned, but unused, vacation prior to the employee‚Äôs initial receipt of PFL benefits. =Job security= The PFL does not offer job security stipulations. Instead, it relies on the limited job security already provided by federal and state laws: an employer is only required to grant time off and to hold a job for an employee if the employer is covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) or the California Family Rights Act (CFRA). The California Family Rights Act offers twelve weeks of unpaid leave for employees of firms with more than 20 workers. =Benefit rates= The California Employment Development Department offers a tool to help calculate benefit payment amounts. Benefits are set at 70% of income for low income earners and 60% for middle and high income earners, however there is a maximum weekly benefit that is tied to the State Average Weekly Wage corresponding to the year of the claim. For 2019, this maximum is $1252 while the lower range of weekly benefits is $50. To qualify for the minimum weekly amount ($50), an individual must have at least $300 of wages (or $75 per quarter) in the base period, which covers 12 months and is divided into four quarters of three months each. Awareness and usage patterns In the first year of the program's passage, only 138,000 people applied for benefits. This was less than half of California's estimate for number of benefit recipients, 300,000. Of those claims, 88% were for bonding with a new child while 12% were for caring for an ill family member. Females dominated the claims, making up 83% of new child claims and 70% of care claims. Although the low number of claims could have been due to the program being relatively unknown, benefits of the program being too low may also have had an impact. In a study conducted in California and Illinois of parents of chronically ill children before (2003-2004) and after (2005-2006) the passage of PFL, no difference was observed in time taken off work to care for a sick or newly born child. Of those parents surveyed, only 18% had heard of the program and 5% had used it. In a survey of 253 employers and 500 employees, 89% of employers said they experienced no noticeable effect or a positive effect from the program, with larger employers having a more favorable view than small employers, likely since they are likely to already provide paid family leave. Sixty percent of employers reported saving on costs by coordinating their own sick leave with PFL. In a 2007 survey of California adults, only 28.1% were aware of the PFL program.Milkman, Ruth.

The genus is endemic to Australia (Queensland and Western Australia).Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families The plant received its name of the snakebush due to frequently being used as a groundcover plant for embankments, nature strips, and roundabouts, creating a perfect habitat for snakes shelter. As a groundcover, the plant is also useful for the control of soil erosion and a barrier in heavy traffic areas due to its prickly foliage.‚ÄúHemiandra Pungens.‚Äù Botanic Gardens of South Australia, plantselector.botanicgardens.sa.gov.au/Plants/Details/749. The bush has thorns around the stem for protection from predators, but snakes can easily maneuver around them. They are all prostrate to smallish shrubs allied to Westringia. The red, lilac, pink, or white flowers are 2-lipped, the lower lip enlarged and spotted. The stiff, narrow leaves often have prickly tips.

Leaves are about twenty millimeters wide and are usually simple lance- shaped with a short sharp point. Hemiandras tend to attract not only snakes, but bees as well. They are tubular flowers with a myriad of pollen and nectar to appeal to bees (Angus). Keeping this in mind, Hemiandras are a phenomenal choice for personal gardens, especially for producing honey. \\"It‚Äôs perfect for pots and hanging baskets and makes for an excellent rockery plant\\".Angus. ‚Äú Hemiandra Pungens ‚Äì Snake Plant.‚Äù Gardening With Angus, http://www.gardeningwithangus.com.au/hemiandra-pungens-snake-plant/ Hermiandra pungens is the most popular one and is an offspring form of the variety Glabra.‚ÄúHemiandra Pungens.‚Äù Australian Native Plants, www.anpsa.org.au/h-pun.html. This has stems and leaves without hairs and pink flowers and spreads to about one meter diameter. Despite being the most popular variety, seeds are difficult to find although the flower is easy to breed. ‚ÄúUsing a related species such as Westringia fruticosa (as has been done with Prostanthera species) may be worth trying to extend the range of cultivation of the species\\". They need very well-drained, preferably sandy soil and prefer a sunny spot, although they will tolerate some shade. They prefer drier, temperate zones and need only be watered sparingly. Prune regularly to keep them tidy and to prolong flowering. Propagate from fresh seed or cuttings. They are prone to fungal diseases in humid conditions. Some success has been had by grafting them onto Westringia stock. They can spread from sixty to eighty feet across the ground, normally blooming in Summer but sometimes starting in late Spring depending on temperatures. Hemiandras are flexible in the type of soil they grow in consisting of clay, gravel, loam, and sand. They tend to bloom best in a cool, semi-arid climate, although they tolerate drought and moderate frost. Hemiandras can also handle environments containing heavy water, allowing them to be pipe and drain friendly and can be found poolside. They require minimal watering but bear excessive amounts, although providing too much water and sun can kill the plant. Hemiandras are considered evergreen plants, providing viewers with an abundance of greenery when blooming, rather than having deciduous leaves.

In the foreground are tape and reel feeders, then the (currently empty) conveyor belt for printed circuit boards, and in back are large parts in a tray. The gantry carries two pickup nozzles, flanking a camera (marked \\"do not touch\\" to avoid fingerprints on the lens). thumb thumb SMT (surface mount technology) component placement systems, commonly called pick-and-place machines or P&Ps;, are robotic machines which are used to place surface-mount devices (SMDs) onto a printed circuit board (PCB). They are used for high speed, high precision placing of broad range of electronic components, like capacitors, resistors, integrated circuits onto the PCBs which are in turn used in computers, consumer electronics as well as industrial, medical, automotive, military and telecommunications equipment. Similar equipment exists for through hole components. This type of equipment is sometimes also used to package microchips using the flip chip method.  History  = 1980s and 1991 = During this time, a typical SMT assembly line employed two different types of pick-and-place (P&P;) machines arranged in sequence. The unpopulated board was fed into a rapid placement machine. These machines, sometimes called chip shooters, place mainly low-precision, simple package components such as resistors and capacitors. These high-speed P&P; machines were built around a single turret design capable of mounting up to two dozen stations. As the turret spins, the stations passing the back of the machine pick up parts from tape feeders mounted on a moving carriage. As the station proceeds around the turret, it passes an optical station that calculates the angle at which the part was picked up, allowing the machine to compensate for drift. Then, as the station reaches the front of the turret, the board is moved into the proper position, the nozzle is spun to put the part in proper angular orientation, and the part is placed on the board. Typical chip shooters can, under optimal conditions, place up to 53,000 parts per hour, or almost 15 parts per second. Because the PCB is moved rather than the turret, only lightweight parts that will not be shaken loose by the violent motion of the PCB can be placed this way. From the high speed machine, the board transits to a precision placement machine. These pick-and-place machines often use high resolution verification cameras and fine adjustment systems via high precision linear encoders on each axis to place parts more accurately than the high-speed machines. Furthermore, the precision placement machines are capable of handling larger or more irregularly shaped parts such as large package integrated circuits or packaged inductor coils and trimpots. Unlike the rapid placers, precision placers generally do not use turret mounted nozzles and instead rely on a gantry-supported moving head. These precision placers rely upon placement heads with relatively few pickup nozzles. The head sometimes has a laser identifier that scans a reflective marker on the PC Board to orient the head to the board. Parts are picked up from tape feeders or trays, scanned by a camera (on some machines), and then placed in the proper position on the board. Some machines also center the parts on the head with two arms that close to center the part; the head then rotates 90 degrees and the arms close again to center the part once more. The margin of error for some components is, in many cases, less than half a millimeter (less than 0.02 inches). The process is a little slower than rapid placement, necessitating careful line balancing when setting up a job, lest the precision placement machine become a production bottleneck. = 2000 to present = Due to the huge cost of having two separate machines to place parts, the speed limitations of the chip shooters, and the inflexibility of the machines, the electronic component machine manufacturers abandoned the technique. To overcome these limitations they moved to an all-in-one modular, multi-headed, and multi-gantry machines that could have heads quickly swapped on different modules depending on the product being built to machines with multiple mini turrets capable of placing the whole spectrum of components with theoretical speeds of 136,000 components an hour. The fastest machines can have speeds of up to 200,000 CPH (components per hour). =2010 onwards = Swapping heads onboard placement machines required more inventory of heads and related spare parts for different heads to minimize the downtime. Placement machines have an all-in-one head that can place components ranging from 01005 to 50 mm √ó 40 mm. In addition to this there was a new concept wherein the user could borrow performance during peak periods. There is a big change in the industry approach these days with more focus on software applications for the process. With new applications like POP and wafer placement on substrate the industry is moving beyond conventional component placement. There is a big difference in the needs of SMT users. For many, the high speed machines are not suitable due to cost and speed. With recent changes in the economic climate the requirement for SMT placement becomes focused on the machine's versatility to deal with short runs and fast changeover. This means that lower cost machines with vision systems provide an affordable option for SMT users. There are more users of low end and mid-range machines than the ultra fast placement systems. SMT pick and place machine manufacturers include: * Juki * Fuji * Panasonic * Yamaha (bought I-Pulse) * Hanwha precision machinery (former Samsung Techwin and later Hanwha Techwin) * Kulicke & Soffa (K&S;) (former Philips and later Assembleon) * Sony (Now Juki) * Asm Siplace (former Siemens) * Universal Instruments * Mycronic * Europlacer * NEODEN * Essemtec * Nordson (Bought Dima) * Hitachi (Former Sanyo, SMT division sold to Yamaha) * DDM Novastar Operation The placement equipment is part of a larger overall machine that carries out specific programmed steps to create a PCB Assembly. Several sub- systems work together to pick up and correctly place the components onto the PCB. These systems normally use pneumatic suction cups, attached to a plotter- like device to allow the cup to be accurately manipulated in three dimensions. Additionally, each nozzle can be rotated independently. =Component feeds= Surface mount components are placed along the front (and often back) faces of the machine. Most components are supplied on paper or plastic tape, in tape reels that are loaded onto feeders mounted to the machine. Larger integrated circuits (ICs) are sometimes supplied arranged in trays which are stacked in a compartment. More commonly ICs will be provided in tapes rather than trays or sticks. Improvements in feeder technology mean that tape format is becoming the preferred method of presenting parts on an SMT machine. Early feeder heads were much bulkier, and as a result it was not designed to be the mobile part of the system. Rather, the PCB itself was mounted on a moving platform that aligned the areas of the board to be populated with the feeder head above. =Conveyor belt= Through the middle of the machine there is a conveyor belt, along which blank PCBs travel, and a PCB clamp in the center of the machine. The PCB is clamped, and the nozzles pick up individual components from the feeders/trays, rotate them to the correct orientation and then place them on the appropriate pads on the PCB with high precision. High-end machines can have multiple conveyors to produce multiple same or different kinds of products simultaneously. =Inspection= The part is carried from the part feeders on either side of the conveyor belt to the PCB, it is photographed from below. Its silhouette is inspected to see if it is damaged or missing (was not picked up), and the inevitable registration errors in pickup are measured and compensated for when the part is placed. For example, if the part was shifted 0.25 mm and rotated 10¬∞ when picked up, the pickup head will adjust the placement position to place the part in the correct location. Some machines have these optical systems on the robot arm and can carry out the optical calculations without losing time, thereby achieving a lower derating factor. The high-end optical systems mounted on the heads can also be used to capture details of the non-standard type components and save them to a database for future use. In addition to this, advanced software is available for monitoring the production and interconnect database ‚Äî of the production floor to that of supply chain ‚Äî in real-time. ASM provides an optional feature for increasing accuracy while placing LED components on a high end product where in the optical center of the LED is critical rather than the calculated mechanical center based on the component's lead structure. The special camera system measures both physical and optical center and makes the necessary adjustments before placement. A separate camera on the pick-and-place head photographs fiducial marks on the PCB to measure its position on the conveyor belt accurately. Two fiducial marks, measured in two dimensions each, usually placed diagonally, let the PCB's orientation and thermal expansion be measured and compensated for as well. Some machines are also able to measure the PCB shear by measuring a third fiducial mark on the PCB. =Variations= To minimize the distance the pickup gantry must travel, it is common to have multiple nozzles with separate vertical motion on a single gantry. This can pick up multiple parts with one trip to the feeders. Also, advanced software in the newer generation machines allows different robotic heads to work independently of each other to further increase the throughput. The components may be temporarily adhered to the PCB using the wet solder paste itself, or by using small blobs of a separate adhesive, applied by a glue-dispensing machine that can be incorporated on to the pick and place machine. The glue is added before component placement. It is dispensed by nozzles or by using jet dispensing. Jet dispensing dispenses material by shooting it towards the target, which in this case, is the circuit board.

Gilbert (1976), in which the Court held that pregnancy discrimination was not a form of sex discrimination under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In March 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States' decision in Young v. United Parcel Service, provided additional clarity on whether and when employers are required to provide work-related accommodations to pregnant employees. The lawsuit stemmed from United Parcel Service's refusal to accommodate a 20-pound lifting restriction of a driver during her pregnancy. Because Ms. Young could not lift the required 70 pounds for drivers, UPS did not allow her to work. Ms. Young provided evidence that a number of employees received accommodations while suffering similar or more serious disabilities. According to the testimony of one UPS employee, the only time a light duty request seemed to become an issue occurred when the request was made by a pregnant employee. The Court held that a pregnant employee can make a prima facie, meaning a plausible case of discrimination, by showing that \\"she belongs to the protected class, that she sought accommodation, that the employer did not accommodate her.\\" The Court further held that a plaintiff can meet a summary judgement standard \\"by providing evidence that the employer accommodates a large percentage of nonpregnant workers while failing to accommodate a large percentage of pregnant workers.\\"  Disability clause  Pregnancy is considered a temporary disability in the eyes of the law, meaning that the treatment of pregnant employees falls under the same jurisdiction as disabled employees. Treating a pregnant employee in a way that would violate disability standards is also a violation of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA). > If an employee is temporarily unable to perform her job due to pregnancy, > the employer must treat her the same as any other temporarily disabled > employee; for example, by providing light duty, modified tasks, alternative > assignments, disability leave, or leave without pay. An employer may have to > provide a reasonable accommodation for a disability related to pregnancy, > absent undue hardship (significant difficulty or expense).\\"  Critical cases  The Geduldig v. Aiello (1974) case involved a pregnant woman who was denied medical benefits under her disability insurance, citing the 14th Amendment, and claiming sex discrimination. The U.S. Supreme Court concluded that there was no evidence of sex discrimination, and that there was no violation of the Equal Protection Clause, as men and women were receiving equal protection under the insurance program, and that because men cannot become pregnant, offering protections for pregnancy would constitute unequal treatment. The court in this case also did not use a heightened level of scrutiny, meaning that the court did not treat this case as one of high importance. This treatment was criticized by Justice Brennan in a dissent in which he argued that physical gender differences should not lead to unequal compensation, and that gender cases should be decided using the strict scrutiny standard. General Electric v. Gilbert (1976) in many ways was influenced by the decision of Geduldig v. Aiello, as the Supreme Court again found no evidence of discrimination. Specifically, in General Electric v. Gilbert the Supreme Court ruled that it was legal for employers to exclude pregnancy-related conditions from employee sickness and accident benefits plans. Again, Justice Brennan dissented, noting for a second time that women were receiving unequal compensation. Due to this dissent and the dissent from Geduldig v. Aiello, U.S. Congress saw a gap in protections and created the Pregnancy Discrimination Act two years later in response.  Other important cases  Rentzer v. Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. (1973) Gail Rentzer suffered from an ectopic pregnancy and was therefore unable to work. She was denied compensation by the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board because they did not recognize pregnancy or related medical complications as a disability. But after a lawsuit was filed, the California Court of Appeals found that because Gail had not had a normal pregnancy and her emergency surgery was performed to stop bleeding and save her life, her pregnancy was deemed worthy of disability benefits. This case allowed women with medical complications during pregnancy to be granted benefits and more protections, such as disability coverage for not just pregnancy, but also the amount of time it takes for recovery from complications. California Federal Savings and Loan Association v. Guerra (1987) Lillian Garland worked as a receptionist for California Federal Savings and Loan Association for a few years as a receptionist when she became pregnant. She took pregnancy disability leave in January, and notified Cal. Fed. of her intent to return in April. On giving notice of her intent to return to work, she was informed that her job was now held by someone else and that there were not equivalent available positions for her. Upon filing a lawsuit, Cal. Fed. argued that the law was discriminatory towards men and violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by giving women more rights than men, instead of equal rights. The Supreme Court held that because protection against pregnancy discrimination was law in California, Garland must be given her job back, but they held that nationally, women are not allowed \\"preferential treatment\\" due to pregnancy. Rent-A-Center West, Inc. v. Jackson (2010) Natasha Jackson was the only woman employee working at Rent-A-Center when she became pregnant. She struggled with morning sickness and also was given a doctor's note restricting her from lifting more than 25 pounds, a task rarely assigned to her position. Her district manager put her on paid leave for two-weeks, but after learning of the doctor's note, told her she could not work until she had delivered her baby and that there was no guarantee of her job being there when she returned. Two months after her baby was born she tried to return to work with a doctor's note and was fired anyway. She filed a pregnancy discrimination case and then changed the complaint to arbitration; she lost her case after three years. Arizanovska v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (2012) Svetlana Arizanovska was working as a shelf stocker at Wal-Mart when she became pregnant, and her doctor told her not to lift more than 20 pounds. She was assigned light-duty work for a little while, but then was told there were no more light assignments available and she was directed to go back to regular work. While lifting, she began to bleed, and upon telling her boss she was told to go back to work, and later learned she had suffered a miscarriage. She became pregnant again 4 months later, and was given orders to lift no more than 10 pounds, but was cleared to work by her doctor. Wal-Mart again said they had no light-duty assignments for her, and put her on unpaid leave, then fired her. Arizanovska miscarried again, and presented the reason as stress due to unemployment. She lost her case both in district and appeals court. These cases give background on what is and is not covered by amendments and acts currently in the U.S. Constitution. The major argument in most cases that lost in court was that providing benefits for pregnant workers gave women more benefits that men had, as pregnancy can not occur within a male body. This therefore shut down the cases being tried under the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, as it requires \\"Equal Protection\\". Other cases show that pregnancies that are not \\"normal\\" or have complications, are covered by the PDA and disability, but normal pregnancies are not. Some cases, such as Rentzer v. Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. are examples of cases which actually changed or added to the PDA, while most of the others display their limitations.  Critiques of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act  The Act has received many critiques about what people are protected, and what is protected by the clause. Some critics say that the Act protects employees in a way that is too focused on biology, and does not protect the social aspects of motherhood. That is, while employees would be protected by the PDA for missing work due to her pregnancy, they would not be protected if they had to miss work to care for their sick child. Other critiques include the argument that the Act does not take into consideration the social, cultural, and financial effects of having the capacity to become pregnant, even if one is not currently pregnant. This means that women are discriminated against in the workplace due to the fact that they could become pregnant, causing them to be given lower wages, fewer promotions, and less authority in the workplace. Critics note that because the PDA protects against discrimination \\"on the basis of pregnancy\\" that wage differences, lack of advancement, hiring, firing and other discriminatory acts towards women are due to their childbearing capacity, and should be protected by the PDA. Some Liberal Feminists argue that asking for too much under the PDA would actually lead to unequal compensation, and would put pregnant workers in the position of losing benefits of the Act all together. They argue that because pregnancy is considered a disability, asking for more disability leave for a pregnancy or complications after a pregnancy could extend the time considered equal to what non-pregnant individuals would take for disability leave, and put them in a position which would allow termination. These critics argue that special treatment in terms of benefits for an entire group would not be as beneficial as equal treatment. Since Liberal Feminists take an individualistic approach to feminist theory, focusing on women gaining and keeping equality through their own actions and choices, this critique does apply to many Liberal Feminists. However, another group of Liberal Feminists argue that this approach is too concerned with policy and not concerned enough with results for women, noting that this theory would not actually help pregnant workers at all, and perhaps put them more at risk for termination. This group of Liberal Feminists also states that the \\"extra\\" benefits that would be provided with the PDA would be putting women on equal ground with men, allowing them to be more equal competitors in their professional lives. A Pluralist Radical Feminist critique of the PDA notes that pregnancy should not be considered a disability at all. They argue that the PDA classifying pregnancy as a disability is too reflective of a phallocentric view of pregnancy, as it refuses to treat pregnancy with its own model and forces it into the same system that men use when \\"disabled\\" even though they cannot experience this. They would argue that a body with the potential to become pregnant does not only have a chance of experiencing pregnancy, but also the unique conditions and complications that may come along with it, and that forcing pregnancy into the guidelines of disability can not fully provide pregnant workers with the protections they need. Transgender exclusion is also a critique of the PDA. Transgender men who still have the capacity to become pregnant are often excluded from the protections of the act due to the language and scope of the protected class defined by the PDA. The PDA states that it protects: \\"women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions\\" which leaves transgender men, and non-binary gender identities outside of the protected class. Many theorists and activists are pushing to change the language of the PDA to make sure that all gender identities will be protected. Many feminists of all backgrounds argue that all of these issues could be avoided if the constitution were to include the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). The ERA \\"was a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution designed to guarantee equal rights for women.\\" It is argued that if the ERA were in place, men and women would have equal rights to work and family simultaneously, as sex equality would be a constitutional right without loopholes. Seeing as Constitutional Amendments and Acts currently do not fully protect workers from pregnancy discrimination, even those that are meant to give equal protections, such as Title XIV and Title VII, many believe the ERA would give protections to pregnant workers more easily. If the ERA were constituted in addition to the PDA, this would allow even more protections under the constitution for pregnant peoples. However, since the proposed amendment constrains only the actions of government and not private employers, how the amendment would bring about such a change remains to be seen.

It followed the Juno 6, an almost identical synthesizer received months earlier. The synthesizers introduced Roland's digitally controlled oscillators, allowing for greatly improved tuning stability. It was widely used in 1980s pop music.  Development  The late 1970s and 1980s saw the introduction of the first digital synthesizers, such as the Fairlight CMI and Synclavier. Roland president Ikutaro Kakehashi recognized that the synthesizer market was moving away from analog synthesis, but Roland had no commercially viable digital technology. He approached American engineer John Chowning about his recently developed means of FM synthesis, but Yamaha had already secured exclusive rights. Roland's response was the Juno 6, released in 1982. It used mostly traditional analog technology, with a voltage-controlled filter, voltage-controlled amplifier, low-frequency oscillator, and ADSR envelope generators. However, it also used digitally controlled oscillators (DCOs), analog oscillators controlled by digital circuits. As opposed to the voltage- controlled oscillators (VCOs) of previous synthesizers, which frequently went out of tune, the DCOs ensured tuning stability. According to Sound on Sound, \\"The Juno 6 was the first analog polysynth that you could carry onto a stage, switch on, and play with complete confidence that the instrument would be in tune.\\" It also included performance controls, an arpeggiator, and an ensemble effect. The Juno 6 was followed in the same year by the Juno-60, which added patch memory (allowing users to save and re-use sounds) and a DCB connector, a precursor to MIDI. Production ended in February 1984, when the Juno-60 was replaced by the Juno-106.  Impact  The Juno-60 was widely used in 1980s pop music, by acts including John Foxx, A-ha, Billy Idol, Berlin, Eurythmics, A Flock of Seagulls, Cyndi Lauper, and Wham!. It was also a key instrument in Chicago house. The 2010s saw a resurgence of popularity among indie and electro acts such as Metronomy, driving up the price on the used market.

He started his career in UNICEF as the Deputy Executive Director in charge of Operations in 1949 and soon developed a reputation for his intellect, efficiency and dedication. He played a leading role in integrating UNICEF into the United Nations Development Programme established in the late 1950s. In 1960, UNICEF established a special survey into the needs of children commissioning reports from the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and other UN organisations. The outcome of this work was the Children of the Developing Countries report arguing that children be the focus of development programs and that UNICEF supported \\"Planning for Children\\". As a result of the new policy guided by Heyward, UNICEF funded educational programs for the first time. Heyward became a Deputy Executive Director of UNICEF in 1975 with the rank of UN Assistant Secretary General. In that year, he played a significant role in reviewing assistance to the third world. He championed the \\"basic services\\" model where services would be integrated and community based rather than the top down model previously in place. UNICEF committed to this model in 1976 and the organisation was working with the WHO in adopting a preventative approach to health care. After some initial reluctance, UNICEF agreed to support a proposal by child related NGOs such as the International Union for Child Welfare to set up the International Year of the Child in 1979. He retired from his position in UNICEF in 1981. However, he continued to travel regularly to Africa on missions from UNICEF, the World Bank and the WHO. For example, in the early 1990s he recommended to the World Bank that iodine be added to water from village wells to address deficiencies in that mineral rather than fortifying salt as salt was not always used. However, he had a stroke in 1997 which meant that he was not able to travel as widely as before. Heyward died in Manhassett on Long Island after a long illness in 2005. Heyward's wife Elisabeth Heyward was a United Nations conference interpreter, and his son Andrew Heyward was president of CBS News until 2005. His other son Peter Heyward was a lawyer in Washington DC.

The Honolulu Museum of Art School (formerly the Academy Art Center at Linekona) offers studio art classes and workshops, and hosts exhibitions showcasing the island's folk and contemporary artists. The school offers arts education programs for children with special needs and public school students and maintains a lending collection for educators, students, and community groups. =Shangri La: Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art= Doris Duke (1912‚Äì1993) built Shangri La with the help of American architect Marion Sims Wyeth. Duke's collection of Islamic art was assembled over 60 years. History Anna Rice Cooke (1853‚Äì1934), daughter of New England missionaries and founder of the Honolulu Museum of Art, in her dedication statement at the opening of the museum on April 8, 1927 said: > \\"That our children of many nationalities and races, born far from the > centers of art, may receive an intimation of their own cultural legacy and > wake to the ideals embodied in the arts of their neighbors ... that > Hawaiians, Americans, Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Filipinos, Northern > Europeans and all other people living here, contacting through the channel > of art those deep intuitions common to all, may perceive a foundation on > which a new culture, enriched by the old strains may be built in the > islands.\\" --Anna Rice CookeEllis, George R., Honolulu Academy of Arts, > Selected Works, Honolulu, Honolulu Academy of Arts, 1990, p.10 Born on Oahu in 1853, Cooke grew up on Kauai island in a home that appreciated the arts. In 1874, she married Charles Montague Cooke and the two eventually settled in Honolulu. In 1882, they built a home on Beretania Street, across from Thomas Square. As Cooke's career prospered, they gathered their private art collection. First were \\"parlor pieces\\" for their home. She frequented the shop of furniture maker Yeun Kwock Fong Inn who often had ceramics and textile pieces sent from his brother in China. The Cookes‚Äô art collection outgrew their home and the homes of their children. In 1920, she and her daughter Alice (Mrs. Phillip Spalding), her daughter-in-law Dagmar (Mrs. Richard Cooke), and Catharine E. B. Cox (Mrs. Isaac Cox), an art and drama teacher, began to catalogue and research the collection with the intent to display the items in a museum. With little formal training, these women obtained a charter for the museum from the Territory of Hawaii in 1922, while continuing to catalogue the collection. Cooke wanted a museum that reflected Hawaii's multi- cultural make-up. Not bound by the traditional western idea of art museums, she also wanted to showcase the island's climate in an open and airy environment, using courtyards which interconnect the galleries throughout the museum. The Cookes donated their Beretania Street land along with an endowment of $25,000. Their home was torn down to make way for the museum. New York architect Bertram Goodhue designed a classic Hawaiian-style building with simple off-white exteriors and tiled roofs. Goodhue died before the project was completed; it was finished by Hardie Phillip. This style has been imitated in many buildings throughout the state. On April 8, 1927, the Honolulu Museum of Art opened. There was a traditional Hawaiian blessing and the Royal Hawaiian Band, under the direction of Henri Berger, played at festivities. With the opening of the museum came gifts of many pieces, sometimes even entire collections. Additions to the original building include a library (1956), an education wing (1960), a gift shop (1965), a cafe (1969), a contemporary gallery, administrative offices and 292-seat theater (1977), and an art center for studio classes and expanded educational programming (1989). In 1999, the museum created a children's interactive gallery, lecture hall, and offices. The original building was named Hawaii's best building by the Hawaii Chapter of the American Institute of Architecture and is registered as a National and State Historical site. The museum is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. In 1998, extensive renovation began starting with the Asian wing. In September 1999, construction began on the John Hara-designed Henry R. Luce Pavilion Complex, which opened May 13, 2001. It includes expanded spaces for The Pavilion Caf√© and The Museum Shop and a new two-story exhibition structure. The Luce Complex is named for Henry R. Luce, the co- founder and editor of Time Magazine and other publications. His widow, Clare Boothe Luce, had a residence in Hawaii and served on the museum's board of trustees from 1972-1977\\\\. Gautama Buddha and the Eight Great Bodhisattvas, Korea, Joseon Dynasty, 16th century New galleries exploring cross-cultural influences, were renovated and re-opened in the Western Wing in November 1999. A new gallery for Korean art was opened in June 2001. New galleries for the arts of India, Indonesia, and Southeast Asia were renovated and opened in January 2002. A new gallery for the art of the Philippines named for retiring Museum Director and his wife, George and Nancy Ellis, opened in 2003. In February 2005, the museum opened an Asian Painting Conservation Studio and in December 2005, completed renovation of the Western Art galleries. In 2001, the museum entered into a partnership with the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art and the theater was refurbished and renamed for her in July 2002. In October 2002, the museum opened a new gallery that serves as the orientation center for all tours to Doris Duke's Honolulu estate Shangri La, which started on November 6, 2002. Due to the 2019‚Äì20 coronavirus pandemic the museum laid off one third of its full-time workers & every seasonal worker that worked part time to reduce the spread of COVID-19 on April 17, 2020. The museum's permanent collection grew to over 38,000 pieces with significant holdings in Asian art, American and European painting and decorative arts, 19th- and 20th- century art, an extensive collection of works on paper, Asian textiles, and traditional works from Africa, Oceania, and the Americas. = The Contemporary Museum and Honolulu Academy of Arts Merge = The former Contemporary Museum, Honolulu in Makiki Heights was integrated into the Honolulu Academy of Arts in July 2011. The Academy's board of trustees voted in December 2011 to change the museum's public name to the Honolulu Museum of Art as of March 2012, retaining its legal name as the Honolulu Academy of Arts. The former Contemporary Museum, or Spalding House, became the Honolulu Museum of Art Spalding House, the Art Center at Linekona became the Honolulu Museum of Art School, and The Contemporary Museum at First Hawaiian Center became the Honolulu Museum of Art at First Hawaiian Center. = Sale of Spalding House = On July 16, 2019, the museum announced that its board of trustees would be selling Spalding House in an effort to \\"allow the museum to focus its resources on its main campus at Beretania Street.\\" Interim director and trustee, Mark Burak, stated: \\"From a fiduciary standpoint, we‚Äôve taken a very long and hard look at this from all angles. While the Spalding House property‚Äôs beauty and historic significance make it hard to part with, it has also been challenging splitting our attention between two large, resource- intensive art campuses, one limited by several factors that have made it difficult to deliver the kind of quality art exhibitions, programs and services we have desired.‚Äù Trustee and chairman of the Building and Grounds Committee, Jim Pearce, added: \\"The committee concluded unanimously that it would be to the long-term benefit of HoMA to prepare Spalding House for sale. We are fortunate to have a board and employees who carefully evaluate all options for the future and are continually making changes to ensure that we maintain the solid financial footing necessary to fulfill our mission. Making and enabling this decision has been determined to represent good business practice for the long term.‚Äù said Jim Pierce, trustee and chairman of the Building and Grounds Committee, in the release. Following these comments regarding the fiduciary responsibility of the Board, many community members speculated on well-being of the institution. In his editorial, Loss Of Spalding House A Reminder Old Money Alone Won‚Äôt Sustain The Arts, Sterling Higa speculated on the financial history of the institution, wide spread urban development across Honolulu, and the arrival of new foreign investment. He writes: \\"Our islands play host to out-of-state wealth. Japanese, Canadian and Chinese money pours in. Silicon Valley billionaires plant roots. Given the context, it seems likely that Spalding House will be sold to a foreign buyer, and the grounds will no longer be accessible to the general public. We can pray for salvation, but salvation may not come. Better to hope that the new oligarchy is as generous as the old oligarchy, which bequeathed us relics like Spalding House. = Directors = * Frank Montague Moore (1924‚Äì1927) * Mrs. Isaac M.

Education The museum's Education Department programs include guided tours, workshops, gallery classes, and children's art activities. Docents are trained to provide gallery tours for the Tea and Tour and Movie and Art Talk programs as well as educational activities such as Keiki-Parent Activity Tours and art experiences for seniors. =Tours= Docents conduct tours for the public, school groups (pre-school and up), and community organizations. Groups of ten or more persons and classes are requested to schedule tours at least two weeks in advance. In a program called Tour and Tea, docents lead discussions in the galleries followed by iced tea in the courtyard. An introductory tour called Treasures of the museum highlights selected works in the permanent collection. Special tours, focusing on temporary exhibitions often include supplementary materials and activities, some especially designed for children. Workshops and exhibition previews for teachers and other educators may also be offered. Theme tours concentrate on a specific country, region, time period, art movement, or groups of artists. Museum tours may be customized to correspond to the specific requirement of a class or group. A training program preparing volunteers to provide docent-guided tours is held only when needed. The four- semester course includes an overview of the museum's collections and programs and a survey of world art. Docent Council meetings are conducted throughout the year along with continuing education of the museum collections and special training sessions for all major and traveling exhibitions. =Movie and Art Talk= Art documentaries are shown on selected Wednesday afternoons in the Education Lecture Hall. Following the film, docents connect the film to the museum collection and continue with a discussion in the gallery. =Children= Families with children can pick up materials at the front desk. Keiki Kit include booklets with stories to read, games and puzzles to solve, and a take-home activity. Gallery Hunt Activity Sheets send the families through the galleries to find certain works of art that focus on a theme. After reading a brief paragraph to learn about the work of art, and answering some questions, children win a prize. Working with the Hawaii Department of Education and Oahu public schools, the museum provides art education programs for selected 5th graders and special education students. The Ambassador program includes three parts. First, an Ambassador brings a museum-in-a-box to the classroom. Next, students tour appropriate galleries at the museum. Finally an Ambassador leads an art project in the classroom. Ambassador Program themes include: East meets West, Hawaii and Its People, Art of the Philippines, Animals in Art, and Animals in Art for Special Education, Art of the Ancient World, and Art of the Pacific. =Other educational resources= kachina doll, Arizona, Hopi people in the Honolulu Museum of Art The museum's educational resources support educators, collectors, students, members, artists and art historians with a small library and a non-reservation collection. The Robert Allerton Art Research Library is open to college-level students, members, and other adults for art historical research.

Traveling exhibitions, and works by Hawaii's contemporary artists, folk artists, and young people are often offered along with supplementary workshops and lectures by mainland and neighbor island artists. =Lending collection= The Lending Collection offers reproductions, original artworks, books and objects for loan and hands-on study to educators, students, and community groups. Located in the basement of the Honolulu Museum of Art School, the Lending Collection is open Wednesday, Friday and Saturday or by appointment. =Honolulu Printmaking Workshop= The Honolulu Printmaking Workshop is a not-for-profit community access studio with presses and technical supplies for lithography, intaglio and relief printmaking. =Art To Go= This outreach program began in 2003 for youth at risk in Hawaii. Art To Go brings art instruction and art supplies to underserved youth throughout the community in cooperation with social service agencies and public schools. Luce Pavilion Complex The Luce Pavilion complex, opened May 13, 2001, includes a new cafe, gift shop, and a two-story building with two galleries. Other facilities include underground storage, loading dock, dry-pipe fire sprinklers, vertical transportation systems for passengers, remote video broadcast capabilities, conservation lighting control systems, and climate control system. The Luce Pavilion Complex is completely wheelchair accessible. The project cost over $9 million. The complex added , increasing the museum size to . The Luce Foundation donated $3.5 million towards the construction of the complex. Ground breaking ceremonies for the complex were held on September 23, 1999 and grand opening was May 13, 2001. The Henry R. Luce Gallery holds traveling exhibitions. =The John Dominis and Patches Damon Holt Gallery= The second floor gallery of the Henry R. Luce Wing in the Luce Pavilion Complex houses a pictorial record of Hawaiian history. The John Dominis and Patches Damon Holt Gallery includes an introduction to indigenous Hawaiian art, early Western views of Hawaii, and the art of contemporary Hawaii-based artists. The gallery reflects changing life and landscapes of post European-contact Hawaii as well as its exploration of Hawaii's changing artistic traditions as Island communities grew and became less isolated during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Early views of Hawaii, dating from the last decades of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th, by expedition artists such as England's John Webber and Robert Dampier, France's Auguste Borget and Stanislaus Darondeau, and Russia's Louis Choris, present images of the Western world's first contact with Hawaii. Nineteenth-century images by European artists such as George Burgess, Paul Emmert, Nicholas Chevalier, and James Gay Sawkins, who passed through Hawaii, show the growth of Western-style communities and an appreciation for the land and sea. The Holt Gallery also features painting, watercolors, drawings, prints and photographs by artists such as Enoch Wood Perry, Jules Tavernier, D. Howard Hitchcock, John La Farge, Georgia O'Keeffe, Ansel Adams, Brett Weston, Roi Partridge, and Jean Charlot. Works by Hawaii-born artists including Marguerite Louis Blasingame, Isami Doi, Hon Chew Hee, Cornelia MacIntyre Foley, and Keichi Kimura reveal the development of an indigenous modernist tradition in 20th century Hawaii, and include today's contemporary artists including Lisa Reihana, James Jack and Yan Pei Ming. Other regional artists in the collection include Charles W. Bartlett, Juliette May Fraser, Shirley Russell, Madge Tennent, and John Young. The John Dominis and Patches Damon Holt Gallery also features space for changing exhibitions which focus on the arts of Hawaii. The Holt Gallery was named for John Dominis Holt and his late wife Frances \\"Patches\\" Damon Holt. John Dominis Holt was born to part- Hawaiian parents of alii rank. He learned the religion, customs, mythology, and the Hawaiian language. By the time he was a teen, he was already a genealogist. Honorary trustee of the museum and wife of John Dominis Holt, Frances \\"Patches\\" Damon Holt was actively involved in many cultural projects. Descendant of a missionary family and a graduate of Punahou School, she received a law degree from Columbia University and was educated in England. Together with her older sister, Harriet Baldwin, she helped to oppose the H-3 project through Moanalua Valley. They also established a foundation to help preserve cultural and environmental values. =Caf√©= The caf√© was established in 1969 to raise funds to purchase art. It had a simple menu and for over twenty years was operated by volunteers. Professional management and staff were gradually added. In September 1999, the caf√© was moved during construction of the Luce Pavilion Complex, and more than doubled in size to . It overlooks a granite waterfall with reflection pond and a glass sculpture by Seattle glass artist Dale Chihuly.

Situated on a hill overlooking the River Clyde, it is north of the village of Milton and east of the town of Dumbarton. The house, an example of Scottish Baronial architecture, was built in the 1860s, and was donated to the people of Dumbarton in 1938. It was subsequently a maternity hospital, and now houses a Christian centre. The house is protected as a category A listed building, while the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland. Landscape features include the Overtoun Bridge on the approach road, designed by H. E. Milner. Estate history =White family= View of the house and gardens from the north In 1859, James White, a retired lawyer and a co-owner of the J & J White Chemical Works in Rutherglen, bought Overtoun Farm with the purpose of building a mansion there. He intended for it to be a country retreat, and initially acquired ; he soon increased this to . White hired the Glasgow-based architect James Smith (1808‚Äì1863) (father of the murder suspect Madeleine Smith) to design and construct the house. A farmhouse on the site was demolished to make way for the mansion. Overtoun House was built between 1860 and 1863, though Smith died before work was completed, and the house was completed by one of his partners. White's family began living in the mansion in 1862. It is recorded that the grounds were laid out by Mr C Kemp of Birkenhead, which is thought to refer to the landscape gardener Edward Kemp (1817‚Äì1891), who was superintendent of Birkenhead Park for Joseph Paxton. Approach from the east to Overtoun House In 1884 James White died, and his son John moved to the estate in 1891 after the death of his mother. John White wanted the house to be expanded further, so he came to an agreement in 1892 with a local pastor, Reverend Dixon Swan, the heir to the adjacent Garshake Farm lands. Under the deal, John White was able to lay out the West Drive and its lodge. The eastern and western sides of the estate were split by a waterfall on the Overtoun Burn. To connect the two sides, a road was built and the Overtoun Bridge erected to designs by Henry Milner, son of Edward Milner. John White took the additional surname of Campbell, and was elevated to the peerage as Baron Overtoun in 1893. However, he died childless in 1908, and was succeeded by his nephew Dr Douglas White, a London-based general practitioner. Lady Overtoun continued to live in the house until 1931, after which Dr White, who seldom visited Scotland, gave the house to the people of Dumbarton in 1938. =Later reuse= On the west side of the house, Overtoun Bridge spans a deep ravine. During the Second World War Overtoun was turned into a convalescent home for injured soldiers and locals. The house remained mainly isolated, and it was not damaged by the bombings of the nearby Clydeside shipyards. In 1947 Overtoun was turned into a maternity hospital. A fire destroyed part of the house in 1948, although there were no deaths, and the hospital remained in operation until 1 September 1970. By this time many of the garden structures, including a folly castle and the walled garden, had been demolished. In 1975 the British government decided to use the house as a base for its Quality of Life Experiment. From 1978 to 1980, a religious group, the Spire Fellowship, utilised the home, and from 1981 to 1994, the estate was used by a group named Youth with a Mission. The house fell into abandonment soon after Youth with a Mission left the area, but in 2001 Pastor Bob Hill from Fort Worth, Texas, leased the property from West Dunbartonshire Council to use as a Christian centre for Scottish youth. The house was used in the 2012 film Cloud Atlas, where it doubled for the house of Vyvyan Ayrs in the 1936 segment, and Aurora House in the 2012 segment. \\"Regeneration\\", which was partially filmed in Overtoun House, is a 1997 film adaptation of the novel of the same name by Pat Barker. The house was used in Caro Emerald's 2013 video for I belong to You. In October 1994 a man killed his baby son by throwing him from Overtoun Bridge. Since 2005 there have been a number of media reports of dogs making what appeared to be a suicidal leap from it. This was attributed to supernatural influence, or explained by the dogs being attracted by scents then losing balance on the sloping parapet of the bridge.

It may also refer to an international agreement that supplements or amends a treaty. A protocol is a rule which describes how an activity should be performed, especially in the field of diplomacy. In diplomatic services and governmental fields of endeavor protocols are often unwritten guidelines. Protocols specify the proper and generally accepted behavior in matters of state and diplomacy, such as showing appropriate respect to a head of state, ranking diplomats in chronological order of their accreditation at court, and so on. One definition is: > Protocol is commonly described as a set of international courtesy rules. > These well-established and time-honored rules have made it easier for > nations and people to live and work together.

Forni on > behalf of the International Association of Protocol Consultants and > Officers. Definitions There are two meanings of the word \\"protocol\\". In the legal sense, it is defined as an international agreement that supplements or amends a treaty. In the diplomatic sense, the term refers to the set of rules, procedures, conventions and ceremonies that relate to relations between states. In general, protocol represents the recognized and generally accepted system of international courtesy.. The term protocol is derived, via French and Medieval Latin, from the Greek word protokollon \\"first glued sheet of or onto a papyrus-roll\\". This comes from the act of gluing a sheet of paper to the front of a document to preserve it when it was sealed, which imparted additional authenticity to it. In the beginning, the term protocol related to the various forms of interaction observed in official correspondence between states, which were often elaborate in nature. In course of time, however, it has come to cover a much wider range of international relations..

He was executed in 1979, the first convicted criminal to be executed in Florida after capital punishment was reinstated in 1976, and the second (after Gary Gilmore) in the United States. Crime Spenkelink was a drifter who was convicted in California for armed robbery and had been sentenced to five years-to-life.Von Drehle, David. Among the Lowest of the Dead: Inside Death Row. New York: Fawcett Crest (imprint of Ballantine Books), 1996. pp. 49-51 He had just escaped from the Slack Canyon Conservation Camp when he shot and killed a small-time criminal named Joseph Szymankiewicz in Tallahassee, Florida, in 1973. He claimed that he acted in self-defense‚Äîthat Szymankiewicz had stolen his money, forced him to play Russian roulette, and sexually assaulted him. However, evidence and witness testimony from a co- defendant indicated that Spenkelink left their shared motel room, returned with a gun, and shot Szymankiewicz in the back. He turned down a plea bargain to second-degree murder that would have resulted in a life sentence. In 1976 he was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. His co- defendant was acquitted. Death Penalty In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court had banned the death penalty, ruling that it had been applied unfairly. Florida and other states rushed to rewrite less-arbitrary laws. Spenkelink appealed his sentence, but in 1977, Governor Reubin Askew of Florida signed Spenkelink's first death warrant. In 1979 Askew's successor, Governor Bob Graham, signed a second death warrant. Spenkelink continued to appeal, earning stays from both the U.S Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court, but both stays were overturned, meaning that Spenkelink would be the first man to suffer the death penalty involuntarily (Gilmore had insisted he wanted to die) since executions were resumed in the U.S. in 1976. Spenkelink's case became a national cause c√©l√®bre, encompassing both the broader debate over the morality of the death penalty and the narrower question of whether the punishment fitted Spenkelink's crime. His cause was taken up by former Florida Governor LeRoy Collins, actor Alan Alda, and singer Joan Baez, among many others. Also at issue was the assertion that capital punishment discriminated against the poor and underprivileged‚ÄîSpenkelink often signed his prison correspondence with the epigram, \\"capital punishment means those without capital get the punishment.\\"John Spenkelink: ExecutedToday.com archive Retrieved April 28, 2011. The execution was finally carried out on May 25, 1979, in \\"Old Sparky\\", the Florida State Prison electric chair. That morning, Doug Tracht, a popular Jacksonville disc jockey, aired a recording of sizzling bacon on his radio program and dedicated it to Spenkelink.Michaud S, Aynesworth H (1999): The Only Living Witness. Penguin Putnam, , p. 10. Aftermath =Abuse allegations= Shortly after Spenkelink's execution and burial at Rose Hills Memorial Park, another Florida death row inmate alleged that prison officials had manhandled and assaulted Spenkelink during preparation for his execution. Several decisions lent credence to these allegations: corrections officials had obscured the death chamber's viewing window while Spenkelink was strapped to the electric chair, citing anonymity concerns; the county did not perform an autopsy on Spenkelink (in violation of state law) because the county coroner considered it a redundant and prohibitively expensive policy; and the prison superintendent had limited visits from family and clergy on Spenkelink's execution day, citing fear of a suicide attempt. Governor Graham commissioned an investigation, which in September 1979 concluded that Spenkelink had been \\"taunted\\" and had loud exchanges with prison guards and staff immediately before his execution, but had not been physically abused. Florida corrections officials responded by allowing witnesses to see the complete execution process going forward. Florida's counties now perform autopsies on all executed inmates. =Murder allegations= In spite of the state's investigation, a rumor began that Spenkelink had been murdered prior to his being brought into the death chamber. The rumor reached Spenkelink's mother Lois, who, after encouragement from a spiritual advisor, paid to have her son's body exhumed for a post-mortem examination. On March 6, 1981, Los Angeles County Coroner Thomas Noguchi announced his finding that the cause of Spenkelink's death was indeed electrocution.

The player controls Alisia, a young woman who is on a quest to avenge her father and save the world. She can fire lightning from her hands and summon four faithful beasts to aid her. The game was published outside of Japan by Sega. Despite the acclaim the game received, it was not a commercial success. The game was also included on the Sega Genesis Mini, released in September 2019. Gameplay Gameplay involves action and platforming elements, as the player controls Alisia to jump onto platforms and kill enemies with the aid of her pets. In Alisia Dragoon, the player controls the protagonist, Alisia, in her quest to save the world by defeating the evil forces that killed her father. The game consists of eight levels of side-scrolling environments; Alisia has to jump across gaps and kill the enemies that stand in her way. Each stage is completed by defeating the boss at the end. Alisia attacks by shooting streaks of lightning from her hands. The attack automatically targets enemies in range but gets weaker with each volley as Alisia's power is depleted. Her power recharges when she stops attacking; when fully charged, it allows her to unleash a multi-target attack, hitting every enemy on the screen. The energy system introduces an element of strategy, encouraging the player to manage Alisia's power to have her able to defend herself at critical moments. Helping Alisia in her quest are her pet monsters. These creatures fly around the heroine on their own, attacking her foes, and blocking enemy attacks from hitting her. There are four pets, each with its own type of attack. The Dragon Frye spits fireballs, and the Boomerang Lizard hurls boomerangs. The Thunder Raven emits a thunder blast that affects enemies across the screen, and the Ball O' Fire burns enemies on contact. Only one pet can fight alongside Alisia in her quest, but the player can select any of the four (or none) as the active companion at any time. Over the course of the game, Alisia and her monsters can improve their abilities by collecting power-ups. These enhancement items are placed throughout the first seven stages, mostly in hidden locations. The various power-ups can heal Alisia and her monsters, increase their maximum life bars, improve their attacks, or grant invulnerability for a certain time. Life bars are lost by taking damage from enemy attacks and traps. When Alisia's pets lose all their life bars, they are removed from play and cannot be brought back until a \\"Revive\\" power-up is collected. If Alisia loses all her life bars, she can restart the level by expending a continue. The game ends if all the continues have been used. Alisia Dragoon has no features for saving the player's progress. After the game is completed, a screen is shown, charting the overall performance of the player based on the number of kills, the power level of Alisia's attack, and the frequency the pet monsters are used. Plot Similar to most action games on the Sega Genesis, the plot in Alisia Dragoon is simple and short. The game goes straight into the action, tasking Alisia to demolish everything in sight. After defeating the final boss, the player is treated to a cinematic cutscene of Alisia's triumphant return to her home. Much of the backstory is described in the manual. Alisia is the daughter of a sorcerer who attempted to stop the prince of all things evil, Baldour. As a child, her father was tortured to death in front of her eyes by Baldour. Although the world has not fully recovered from the devastating effects of Baldour's last visit, Baldour's aide Ornah manages to transport his dormant cocoon back to Earth. Now a woman with magical ability rivaling that of her father, Alisia sets out to destroy Baldour's cocoon before he can awaken. Development In 1992, Japanese animation studio Gainax was in a collaboration with Game Arts, the makers of the Lunar role-playing games, to produce an action video game. (Translation by Shmuplations. ). (Translation by Shmuplations. ). Gainax's video game product line tended to target a niche crowd who generally preferred dating simulations and anime-based adventure games. Alisia Dragoon is a departure from this tradition. The animation studio handled the artistic end of the production, writing the story and creating the artwork that would be used for the design of the game's environments and characters. Several of its founders had worked on Hayao Miyazaki's animated films, and the influences of Miyazaki's 1984 science fiction animated film Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind were evident in certain levels of the game. Similarly, due to the predominance of mixing science fiction with fantasy themes in the Japanese animation circles at that time, Alisia Dragoon featured high-tech spaceships and robots alongside mythical zombies and dragons. The composition of the soundtrack was delegated to Mecano Associates, who had produced the music for other works from Game Arts, such as the action games Fire Hawk: Thexder 2 and Silpheed. Game Arts, however, did most of the work in producing Alisia Dragoon, adapting the artwork into environments and creatures that can be rendered by the console hardware, and writing them as lines of software code. Reception Due to a small customer base in Japan, Alisia Dragoon sold few copies on its release (April 24, 1992); the console it was made for, the Sega Mega Drive, was not a popular device in Japan, selling 3-3.5 million units (10% of all Mega Drives/Genesis sold around the world). The game was published earlier by Sega for North America. However, it was a subdued release; Sega did not place major advertisements for the game in the media. To localize the contents for the Western market, the video game publisher made several cosmetic changes to Alisia Dragoon. Instead of a big-eyed heroine drawn in typical anime styling, Alisia was portrayed as a golden bikini-wearing barbarianess on the box covers outside Japan. The Western depiction of Alisia was likened to the scantily clad females in artist Boris Vallejo's work. Westerners were more enthusiastic toward the game than were the Japanese, although there were a few negative appraisals. GamePro magazine opined Alisia Dragoons responsive controls, coupled with the hectic action and handsome graphics, made the game highly desirable for owners of the Genesis console. The Lessers of Dragon magazine were equally impressed with the gameplay, praising Alisia Dragoon for its \\"solid arcade action\\" that satisfied their \\"need for fast reflexes\\". Mean Machiness Julian Rignall praised the game for its pet monsters design, calling the management of the pets in the game an encouragement toward tactics. His fellow reviewer, Richard Leadbetter, wrote the game was visually attractive with \\"beautiful sprites\\" and \\"amazing backdrops\\". He found the gameplay challenging, being forced to conserve energy as the game \\"[threw] everything but the kitchen sink at [him]\\". Rignall agreed with Leadbetter on the game's difficulty, which along with the secret rooms and power-ups to be discovered made Alisia Dragoon an excellent action platform game that had long-lasting appeal. Of the hundreds of Genesis games, Mega magazine rated Alisia Dragoon among the top 100 games, calling it \\"[probably] the best dragon-based platform game around.\\" Despite the positive sentiments, sales of the game outside Japan were weak. Sixteen years after the game's release, Todd Ciolek of Anime News Network reviewed Alisia Dragoon and repeated much of the same sentiments as the Mean Machines reviewers. Noting Gainax's catalog of games, he noted that Alisia Dragoon was very different from the rest; instead of targeting hardcore fans of anime and focusing on exploitive themes, the game's appeal was for everyone. In light of this, Ciolek called Alisia Dragoon \\"the best video game Gainax ever touched\\" and \\"a spectacular ride in its own right\\". Alisia Dragoon has been recognized retrospectively as a relatively early video game to challenge a gender bias prevalent in the industry at the time, despite a great number of Mega Drive/Genesis titles featuring lead female protagonists prior to Alisia Dragoon's release. In the early 1990s, the video game market was skewed toward the young male demographic, with games often portraying women as \\"damsels in distress\\", requiring rescue by male protagonists.

The Greater Union Organisation is a subsidiary of the ASX-listed Event Hospitality and Entertainment, a corporation that owns and operates brands in the entertainment, hospitality and leisure sectors, mainly within Australasia. History The Event Cinemas cinema chain has had a great impact on the Australian culture and film industry and has a history of mergers and acquisitions and liquidations that span over a century. From 1906 to 1911, during the silent era, Australia was the most prolific producer of feature films in the world, a period which included the creation of the first feature- length film The Kelly Gang. This creative and fertile period in Australian film history was largely created by competition between West's Pictures, Spencer's Pictures and Amalgamated Pictures. On 4 May 1912 the three joined to form The General Film Company of Australasia. On 4 January 1913 it then merged with The Greater J.D. Williams Amusement Co and restructured to become The Combine, a famous partnership between exhibition wing Union Theatres and the production and distribution wing Australasian Films. The Combine monopoly was highly influential on the early twentieth-century Australian film industry. However, it came under heavy criticism for its low interest in producing Australian films, its preference for imported cinema, and its reluctance to exhibit Australian films by other producers. Film icon and director Raymond Longford, whose independent production company had come under attack by the group, said in 1927 that \\"had it not been for the activities of that firm in its endeavour to crush it in its infancy, the local picture would now be 10 years at least advanced to the height now attained by the Americans.\\" Historians have traced the sharp decline of the Australian film industry in 1913 to the repercussions of these series of takeovers and mergers. James Sabine has said that \\"the stranglehold of The Combine forced a decline in local production and contributed to many Australian production companies closing their doors.\\" left The Combine continued to grow into the 1920s during the genesis of the Hollywood era with its focus on exhibiting American films. The Great Depression saw Union Theatres being liquidated in 1931 and its assets purchased by newly formed Greater Union Theatres. This new company split from Australasian Films, established the Hollywood-model subsidiary Cinesound Productions, expanded into radio and newspaper, and kept its major focus on building and managing cinemas. Due to The Depression, Greater Union Theatres merged into the General Film Corporation with Hoyts, a competitor who had secured Fox Film as a shareholder. In 1937 Norman Rydge became managing director and removed the company from the previous merger. In 1945 in the last year of World War II there was a box office boom and the British Rank Organisation purchased a half share in Greater Union Theatres. During this time Greater Union acquired the rights of ownership of many theatres across the country including what became the Phoenician Club in Broadway, Sydney in 1943, originally owned by McIntyre's Broadway Theatres and established as a cinema in 1911. In 1958 the four holding companies in the Greater Union Theatres group were merged into the Rydge family Amalgamated Holdings Limited (AHL), and in 1965 Greater Union Theatres was renamed the Greater Union Organisation (GUO). In 1980 billionaire Alan Rydge was appointed Chairman of AHL to become the youngest chairman of an Australian public company. In 1984 AHL regained control over the now-defunct Rank Organisation's half share, meaning that it once again became fully Australian owned. In 1987 GUO merged with Village Roadshow to form the distribution company Roadshow Film Distributors. In 1991 GUO acquired Birch, Carroll & Coyle. In 2003 AHL and Village Roadshow combined to form Australian Theatres. Since 2009 a number of cinemas have been renamed from Greater Union Cinemas to Event Cinemas. On 22 December 2015 AHL was renamed Event Hospitality and Entertainment. Event Cinemas George St (Sydney CBD) is regarded as the company's flagship location. In 2019, Birch Carroll & Coyle was inducted into the Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame in recognition of being Australia's leading provincial film distributor and its industry leadership throughout Queensland for 80 years.

Controversy  The exhibition and production company that became Event Cinemas has been widely criticised as the cause of the downfall of early Australian film, which was argued to be the best in the world at the time. In 2005, Event Cinemas banned people from bringing their own food and drink into the cinema. After negative public reaction and a threat of investigation by NSW Fair Trading, the company was forced to revoke the rule. People complained that Event Cinema's food was more than double the price of that in supermarkets and had less variety. In 2012, Australian journalist Tim Burrowes attended a screening of Skyfall at an Event Cinema. There were various technical difficulties which resulted in the audience being asked to leave and a manager threatening Burrowes for filming the crowd's reactions. In the lead up to the 2016 Australian Federal Election, Chairman Alan Rydge was reported to have donated to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's controversial political fund the Wentworth Forum. There have been numerous incidents of faulty popcorn machines causing fires to break out in Event Cinema complexes, including Adelaide and Rockhampton in September 2015, Perth in December 2015, and Sydney in August 2016.

Bolander was born in Schl√ºchtern, Germany and emigrated to the United States in 1846. He joined his uncle in Columbus, Ohio and enrolled in the Columbus Lutheran Seminary. He graduated from the seminary and was ordained a minister but never served in a religious office. Instead, he began his career teaching at the local German-American schools in 1851. In 1857 he married Anna Marie Jenner, a widow who had three children from her previous marriage; together, they eventually added five more children to their family. At the same time, Bolander became acquainted with a neighbor, Leo Lesquereux, a well-known botanist who had emigrated from Switzerland in 1847. Lesquereux inspired Bolander to develop a keen interest in botany. Bolander began to travel widely in Ohio and neighboring states to study the flora and collect specimens. In 1857 he teamed with John H. Klippart, the Ohio Secretary of Agriculture, to create a catalog of the plants of Ohio. However, in 1860 failing health caused Bolander to return to Germany and the catalog was never published. Bolander recovered his health and returned to America the following year, settling this time in San Francisco, California. He taught for the San Francisco School District and made the acquaintance of members of the California Academy of Sciences and the California Geological Survey. In 1864 he succeeded William Henry Brewer as State Botanist for California and for the next several years he made extensive surveys and collections of plants for the Survey. Bolander published few botanical papers but he was widely recognized for his knowledge of California plants and his ability to identify and collect new species. He corresponded frequently with eminent botanists and shared his collections with them. They showed their gratitude, in part, by naming many new species in his honor‚Äîby one count, 37 species of flowering plants bore his name. In 1871 Bolander was elected California Superintendent of Public Instruction, an office which he held until December 1875. During his term he revised the course of study for California schools, requiring the study of music and drawing. At the same time, important education statutes were enacted by the State Legislature. California led the nation by implementing a strong compulsory education law for children eight to fourteen years of age. California also passed laws ensuring women could serve on school boards and in other educational offices; furthermore, women employed as teachers were guaranteed the same pay as men. At the end of his term, Bolander did not seek re-election and instead ran successfully for Superintendent of Schools of San Francisco. He held the office for almost two years and then resigned in November, 1877. In 1878, Bolander travelled to Guatemala where he did educational work for the next seven years. He reportedly travelled widely to South America, Africa, and Europe but the details are not clear. In 1883, Bolander settled in Portland, Oregon and taught modern languages at Bishop Scott Academy.

Y√ºr√ºk rugs have a long shaggy pile, tied with Ghiordes knots. The warp and the filler (the weft between the knots) is generally composed of sheep's wool or goat hair. The rugs have large geometric motifs in bright colors on a dark brown background; the colors are often described as brilliant. The sides of the rugs are either selvaged, frequently with goat hair, or overcast with colored yarn, and the ends have a braided fringe. The design of Y√ºr√ºk rugs resembles rugs of the Kazak region more than Anatolia. The use of a latch hook is also shared with Kazak rugs. Y√ºr√ºk rugs tend to be more loosely woven than other rugs from Anatolia in that there are more rows of filler between the knots. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, there is a distinction between Y√ºr√ºk rugs from eastern and western Anatolia. The rugs from western Anatolia traditionally have diagonal patterns in brick red and dark blue, and highlights in ivory. These rugs are sometimes confused with Baluchi rugs, a type of Afghan rug. Eastern Anatolian Y√ºr√ºk rugs have hexagonal and lozenge patterns with offset knots that produce diagonal, rather than vertical, rows.

He is currently the goalkeeping coach at Ipswich Town. Early life Walker was born on 9 July 1973 at 3.00am in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, weighing 7lbs 13oz. His father, Barry, was employed as a miner before working in an office, while his mother ran her own hairdressing salon.Walker and Poole, p. 12 He has a younger sister, Elizabeth. When Walker was eleven years old, his parents divorced, and he continued to live with his mother. Within a year, his father married again to his step-mother, Hilary.Walker and Poole, p. 13 Club career =Walsall= Walker joined Notts County as a trainee in July 1991, but failed to make a first-team appearance and moved to Walsall in August 1993, making his debut in the same month. He went on to make 475 appearances in all competitions for Walsall in eleven years, the most by any goalkeeper for the club and became a cult hero at Bescot Stadium. While at Walsall he was a key player in three promotion seasons, won their Player of the Season award twice and was selected in the PFA Second Division Team of the Year in 2001. He was awarded a testimonial in the summer of 2003. Walker's popularity proved such that an autobiography was commissioned to coincide with his testimonial season; ghosted by Walsall programme editor, Andrew Poole, it proved to be a relative success with fans of Walsall and of West Ham United. Walker's successes at Walsall included promotion from Division Three in 1995 and from Division Two in 1999 and again in 2001. He was nicknamed \\"Wacka\\" by the Walsall fans. =West Ham United= West Ham acquired Walker's services from Walsall on a Bosman free transfer in the summer of 2004. Walker, who provided competition for Stephen Bywater, was the second choice goalkeeper at Upton Park but gained a regular first team place within a year of his arrival. Walker gained praise from West Ham fans on saving a penalty taken by Frank Lampard in the League Cup in October 2004, in front of the West Ham supporters' end at Stamford Bridge. However, despite his heroics, the Hammers lost the tie 1‚Äì0. Walker helped West Ham win promotion in 2005, but a serious knee injury in the closing stages of the play-off final saw him miss the majority of the 2005‚Äì06 season. He made his first appearance since the knee injury, and his Premiership debut at the age of 32, in a 4‚Äì2 defeat to Portsmouth in March 2006. He made only two more first team appearances, though collected a FA Cup Final runners up medal as an unused substitute in May 2006. The presence of Roy Carroll and Robert Green as goalkeepers at West Ham during the 2006‚Äì07 season meant that Walker's first-team chances were limited; in spite of this, he still remained a popular figure at Upton Park. On 27 November 2008, Walker signed on loan for Colchester United. He made his debut for Colchester on 29 November 2008 in their 2‚Äì1 victory against Northampton Town and played 16 times for the club before returning to West Ham. On 3 June 2009, West Ham announced that Walker had been released. =Tottenham Hotspur= At the start of September 2009, at the age of 36, Walker was signed on a short-term contract by Tottenham Hotspur as a third choice goalkeeper. He was released by Tottenham on 1 July 2010 without making a first-team appearance. =Return to Walsall= On 29 October 2010, Walker re-signed for Walsall, on a short-term contract due to end in January 2011. On 28 January 2011 he extended his contract to the end of the 2010‚Äì11 season. On 12 April 2011 Walker made his 500th appearance for the \\"Saddlers\\", against Brentford, which ended in a 3‚Äì2 win for Walsall. On 8 June 2011, Walker signed a further one-year contract with the club. On 7 January 2012, in a 2‚Äì2 home draw with AFC Bournemouth, Walker made his 529th appearance in all competitions for the club, equalling Colin Harrison's appearance record. He broke the record, which had stood since 1981, in an away fixture against Brentford the following week, on 14 January 2012. He kept a clean sheet in a match that finished 0‚Äì0. In July 2012, Walker signed a fresh one-year deal with Walsall which saw him working in a player- coach role with the League One club. On 7 February 2013, after making 533 appearances for the club during two separate spells over the past two decades, Walker left Walsall by mutual consent.BBC Sport - Jimmy Walker: Walsall part company with veteran goalkeeper He had failed to make a first-team appearance during his final season with the club. Coaching career In 2013, Walker replaced Barry Richardson as the first team goalkeeper coach at Peterborough United.New Posh goalkeeping coach - Peterborough United - Peterborough Telegraph On 21 February 2015, Walker left Peterborough following the sacking of manager Darren Ferguson.

He was a member of the New York State Assembly, Lieutenant Governor of New York, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, and elected to the US House of Representatives. For his contribution towards the formation of the Republican Party, Raymond has sometimes been called the \\"godfather of the Republican Party.\\" Biography =Early life and ancestors= Henry Jarvis Raymond in his younger years He was born on January 24, 1820, on the family farm near Lima, New York, a son and the eldest child of Lavinia Brockway, the daughter of Clark Brockway and Sally Wade and Jarvis Raymond, the son of Jonathan P. Raymond and Hannah Jarvis. He was an 8th generation direct lineal descendant of Captain Richard Raymond (1602‚Äì1692) and his wife, Judith. There is no evidence to suggest that he was born in Essex, England, although Samuel Raymond's family history makes that claim, and he arrived in Salem, Massachusetts, about 1629/30, possibly with a contingent led by the Rev. Francis Higginson. The first actual date given for Richard is on August 6, 1629, when he is on the list of the 30 founding members of the First Church (Congregational) of Salem. He was about 27 years old. He was made a Freeman of Salem in 1634 and was later a founder of Norwalk, Connecticut, and an \\"honored forefather of Saybrook\\". =Education= Raymond gave early evidence of his superior intellectual skills: it is said that he could read by the age of three and deliver speeches when he was five. He enrolled at age twelve in the Genesee Wesleyan Seminary at Lima, New York, a school established by the Methodist Episcopal Church which would later grow into Syracuse University. He graduated from the University of Vermont in 1840 with high honors. Between 1841 and 1851, Raymond worked for various newspapers, including Horace Greeley's New York Tribune and James Watson Webb's Courier and Enquirer, as a journalist and associate editor. He had known George Jones since their time at the Tribune and the two had often discussed the possibility of starting a newspaper themselves. In 1851, Raymond convinced Jones to become his partner and publish a new paper that would report the news in a neutral manner. In 1851, Raymond formed Raymond, Jones & Company, Inc. and founded The New York Times. He was the newspaper's editor until his death. =Marriage and family= On October 24, 1843, in Winooski, Vermont, Raymond married Juliette Weaver (April 12, 1822 ‚Äì October 13, 1914), who was a daughter of John Warren Weaver and Artemisia Munson. Henry and Juliette were the parents of seven children. Their son, Henry Warren Raymond, (1847‚Äì1925), was an 1869 graduate of Yale College, and, in the same year, was initiated as a member of the Skull and Bones secret society. He also graduated from Columbia University School of Law in 1871. He was a reporter for The New York Times from 1869 to 1872, and he also served as private secretary to the Secretary of the Navy Benjamin F. Tracy, from 1889 to 1893. He entered private law practice in 1893. Their daughter Mary Elizabeth Raymond, born September 10, 1849 in New York City and died on June 13, 1897, in Morristown, New Jersey, married on April 18, 1872 at New York City, Earl Philip Mason born in Providence, Rhode Island, on August 5, 1848, and died at San Antonio, Texas, on March 17, 1901. His father was the founder of the Rhode Island Locomotive Works in 1865 in Providence, Rhode Island. He joined the company in 1872 and remained with the company until 1895, eventually becoming vice-president. Their daughter, Aimee Juliette Arteniese Raymond (1857‚Äì1903) was a physician, writer and editor. She graduated from New York Medical College in 1889. She was married to Dr. Henry Harmon Schroeder. Politics =New York State politics= Raymond was a member of the New York State Assembly in 1850 and 1851, and in the latter year was elected Speaker. A member of the Whig Party's Northern radical anti-slavery wing, his nomination over Greeley on the Whig ticket for Lieutenant Governor of New York in 1854 led to the dissolution of the political partnership of Seward, Weed, and Greeley. Raymond was elected lieutenant governor and served from 1855 to 1856. Raymond has sometimes been called \\"the godfather of the Republican Party,\\" as Raymond had a prominent part in the formation of the Republican Party and drafted the Address to the People, adopted by the Republican organizing convention that met in Pittsburgh on February 22, 1856. In 1862, he was again Speaker of the New York Assembly. =Federal politics= During the American Civil War, Raymond supported Abraham Lincoln's policies in general, but protested his delays in aggressively prosecuting the war. He was among the first to urge the adoption of a broad and liberal postwar attitude toward the people of the South and opposed the Radical Republicans, who wanted harsher measures against the South. In 1865, he was a delegate to the National Republican Convention and was made Chairman of the Republican National Committee. He was a member of the US House of Representatives from 1865 to 1867. On December 22, 1865, he attacked Thaddeus Stevens's theory of the dead states in which states that had seceded were not to be restored to their former status in the Union. and, Agreeing with the President, raymond argued that the states were never out of the Union since the ordinances of secession were null. Raymond authored the Address and Declaration of Principles issued by the Loyalist Convention (or National Union Convention) at Philadelphia in August 1866. His attack on Stevens and his prominence at the Loyalist Convention caused him to lose favor with the Republican Party. He was removed from the chairmanship of the Republican National Committee in 1866, and in 1867, his nomination as minister to Austria, which he had already refused, was rejected by the US Senate. He retired from public life in 1867 and devoted his time to newspaper work until his death in New York City in 1869. Journalistic career Raymond began his journalistic career on Horace Greeley's Tribune and gained further experience in editing James Watson Webb's Courier and Enquirer. Then, with the help of friends, Raymond raised $100,000 capital, a hundred times what Greeley staked on the Tribune ten years earlier, and founded The New York Times on September 18, 1851. Editorially, Raymond sought a niche between Greeley's open partisanship and Bennett's party neutrality. In the first issue of the Times Raymond announced his purpose to write in temperate and measured language and to get into a passion as rarely as possible. \\"There are few things in this world which it is worthwhile to get angry about; and they are just the things anger will not improve.\\" In controversy he meant to avoid abusive language. His editorials were generally cautious, impersonal, and finished in form. President Lincoln wrote, \\"The Times, I believe, is always true to the Union, and therefore should be treated at least as well as any.\\"Basler, 360 Raymond's moderation was evident during the period after Lincoln's election and before his nomination. He wrote to the Alabama secessionist William L. Yance, \\"We shall stand on the Constitution which our fathers made. We shall not make a new one, nor shall we permit any human power to destroy the one.... We seek no war‚Äîwe shall wage no war except in defense of the constitution and against its foes. But we have a country and a constitutional government. We know its worth to us and to mankind, and in case of necessity we are ready to test its strength.\\"Davis, 50‚Äì51 \\"That sentiment guided the editorial course of The Times through the turbulent winter between Lincoln's election and the attack on Fort Sumter. Raymond deprecated, as all sensible men deprecated, any hasty aggression which might provoke to violence men who could still, perhaps, be brought back to reason; but he insisted that as a last resort the union must be maintained by any means necessary. To the proposals for compromise he was favorable, on condition that they did not compromise the essential issue‚Äîthat they did not nullify the election of 1860 and give back to the slave power the control of the national government which it had lost. Because no other compromise would have been acceptable the issue inevitably had to be fought out, and from Sumter to Appomattox The Times was unwavering in its support of Lincoln and its determination that the Federal union must and should be preserved.\\" Works Raymond was an able public speaker; one of his best known speeches was made to greet Hungarian leader Lajos Kossuth, whose cause he defended, during Kossuth's visit to New York City in December 1851.Maverick, Augustus.

Life and career Lyubimov was born in Yaroslavl in 1917. His grandfather was a kulak who fled to Moscow to escape arrest during the collectivisation. Lyubimov's father, Pyotr Zakharovich, was a merchant, who worked for a Scottish company, and his mother, Anna Alexandrovna, was a half-Russian and half-Gypsy schoolteacher. They moved to Moscow in 1922, where both were arrested. Lyubimov studied at the Institute for Energy in Moscow.Yury Lyubimov at the Taganka Theatre, 1964-1994 - Page 1, by Birgit Beumers He was a member of Mikhail Chekhov's Second Moscow Art Theater from 1934 to 1936. During the 1930s, he also met Vsevolod Meyerhold, the avant- garde director. Lyubimov worked in the Song and Dance Ensemble of the NKVD, where he met and befriended Dmitri Shostakovich, Nikolai Erdman and many others. After service in the Red Army during World War II, Lyubimov joined the Vakhtangov Theatre (founded by Yevgeny Vakhtangov). In 1953, he received the USSR State Prize. Lyubimov started teaching in 1963 and formed the Taganka Theatre the following year. His celebrated production of Bertold Brecht's The Good Person of Setzuan with Anna Orochko's class at the Schukin Theatre Institute earned him the artistic directorship of the Taganka Theatre. With Meyerhold, Stanislavsky, Vakhtangov and Brecht as his spiritual guides, Lyubimov eschewed Soviet drama for the more imaginative worlds of poetry and narrative fiction, which he dramatized, and the classics, which he broke apart, reconstituted and presented from a pronounced critical perspective.The Cambridge Guide to Theatre - Page 656, by Martin Banham - 1995 Under Lyubimov, the theatre rose to become the most popular in Moscow, with Vladimir Vysotsky and Alla Demidova as the leading actors. In 1971 Shakespeare's Hamlet became one of Lyubimov's highly successful and much acclaimed productions.FOUNDER OF THE THEATER ON TANGANKA YURI LYUBIMOV TURNS 93 Retrieved 5 December 2015. In 1976 he was awarded by the BITEF First Prize for Hamlet. In 1975 he directed the original production of Al gran sole carico d'amore by Luigi Nono at the Teatro alla Scala (Nono himself and Lyubimov wrote the libretto). Long a Soviet underground classic, Mikhail Bulgakov's novel The Master and Margarita was finally brought to the Russian stage at the Taganka in 1977, in an adaptation by Lyubimov.The Cambridge Guide to World Theatre (CUP 1988) According to B. Beumers, the major innovations Lyubimov brought to theatrical history are the creation of a new theatrical genre, the poetic theatre, in which all revolves around one metaphor, and the creation of a new form of dramatic material, which incorporates a historical and biographical context.Yuri Lyubimov: Thirty Years at the Taganka Theatre, by B. Beumers, 2004, p. 6. Lyubimov's performances ‚Äî including the well-known Antiworlds, Pugachev, Listen!, and Comrade, believe, as well as newer Before and After, Oberiuty, and Honey ‚Äî were fed and filled with poetic energy. In another performance, Fallen and Living, Yuri Lyubimov and David Samoilov built on verses by Pavel Kogan, Semyon Gudzenko and other poets of the World War II generation.Fallen and Living, Taganka Theatre After Vysotsky's death in 1980, all of Lyubimov's productions were banned by the Communist authorities. In 1984, he was stripped of Soviet citizenship. Thereupon he worked abroad before returning to the Taganka Theatre in 1989. His staging of Eugene Onegin premiered in the Taganka on his 85th birthday to much critical acclaim. While in the West he maintained a busy directing career. In the United States he directed Crime and Punishment at Arena Stage and Lulu at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. In 1983 he directed Crime and Punishment in London, winning the Evening Standard Award for Best Director, in 1985 he directed St Matthew Passion at La Scala. His effort to re-stage his famous The Master and Margarita at the American Repertory Theater failed to materialize because of a disagreement with the management of that company. In 1989, his Russian citizenship was restored. In June 2011, before a performance of Bertolt Brecht's play The Good Person of Szechwan in Czech, the actors of Taganka refused to rehearse unless they were paid first. Lyubimov paid the money and left the theatre. \\"I've had enough of this disgrace, these humiliations, this lack of desire to work, this desire just for money\\", he said. Lyubimov retired from the theatre the following week. Two leading actors of theatre, Dmitry Mezhevich and Alla Smirdan, as well as some administrative assistants, followed Lyubimov. His dramatization of Dostoyevsky's Demons premiered the next year. In June 2013 Lyubimov staged Alexander Borodin's opera Prince Igor at the Bolshoi Theatre, which was warmly received by audiences and critics. The new Prince Igor is shorter, with Lyubimov cutting out some parts of the opera. According to Vassily Sinaisky, the Bolshoi chief conductor, such a new structure of the opera was conceived to make it more dynamic and intense.The Prince Igor Opera Gets Revamped Retrieved 14 July 2016. Lyubimov staged over 100 dramas and operas. \\"People tried to stick me with the label of political theater. But that's wrong. I was engaged in an aesthetic, in the expansion of the palette ‚Äî what shades could be added in working with space and style,\\" he says. Leonardo Shapiro concludes that \\"Lyubimov is probably best known for his daring theatrical adaptations of poetry and novels and his successful (and sometimes unsuccessful) run-ins with Soviet Premiers and Ministers of Culture over forbidden material.\\"Shapiro, Leonardo http://bombsite.com/issues/34/articles/1404, BOMB Magazine Winter, 1991. Retrieved on 31 May 2013. As an actor, he performed in 37 plays and 17 films, and several remain classics.
